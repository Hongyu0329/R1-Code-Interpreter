    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task, followed by the Python code to present the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Formulate the Problem**: The task is to find the equilibrium expressions for mean energy `<E>` and entropy `S` for a system of light quanta (photons). Photons follow Bose-Einstein statistics and their total number is not conserved, which implies their chemical potential is zero (`μ=0`). In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the most probable macrostate, which is the one that maximizes entropy. This core idea is formally described by large deviation principles like the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem.\n\n2.  **Methodology**: I will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the entropy `S` for a Bose gas, subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy `<E>`. This is the standard procedure in the microcanonical or canonical ensemble that finds the most probable distribution of particles among energy states.\n\n3.  **Derive the Particle Distribution**: Maximizing the entropy `S` with the energy constraint `<E> = Σ n_i ε_i` yields the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the equilibrium occupation number `<n_i>` of an energy state `ε_i`. For photons (`μ=0`), this is `<n_i> = 1 / (exp(β ε_i) - 1)`, where `β` is the inverse temperature `1/(k_B T)`.\n\n4.  **From Sums to Integrals**: For a continuous spectrum of photon energies in a 3D volume `V`, the sums over discrete states are replaced by integrals over energy. This requires the density of states `g(ε)` for photons, which is `g(ε) = (8πV / (h³c³)) * ε²`, including the two polarization states.\n\n5.  **Calculate Mean Energy `<E>`**: I will calculate the total mean energy by integrating the energy of a state multiplied by its occupation number over the density of states: `<E> = ∫ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε`. This calculation results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n6.  **Calculate Entropy `S`**: Similarly, entropy can be found by integrating the statistical formula for a Bose gas. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the thermodynamic relationship derived for a photon gas, `S = 4<E> / (3T)`.\n\n7.  **Final Python Code**: I will write a Python script that presents these derived formulas for `<E>` and `S`. The script will use the `print` function to clearly display the equations, ensuring all numerical constants are explicitly shown as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_photon_gas_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and displays the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas), based on principles of statistical\n    mechanics, which are formally justified by large deviation theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Derivation of Equilibrium Values for a Photon Gas\")\n    print(\"=\" * 50)\n    print(\"The system is a gas of photons (light quanta) in a volume V at a temperature T.\")\n    print(\"Photons are bosons with zero chemical potential.\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium state is found by maximizing entropy subject to a fixed mean energy.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons: n(e) = 1 / (exp(e/(k_B*T)) - 1)\")\n    print(\"\\nIntegrating over the density of states for photons yields the following results.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Variable Definitions for the equations ---\n    # These are string representations for the final output.\n    energy = \"<E>\"\n    entropy = \"S\"\n    volume = \"V\"\n    temp = \"T\"\n    boltzmann_const = \"k_B\"\n    planck_const = \"h\"\n    speed_of_light = \"c\"\n    pi_symbol = \"pi\"\n\n    # --- Mean Energy ---\n    print(\"\\n1.
