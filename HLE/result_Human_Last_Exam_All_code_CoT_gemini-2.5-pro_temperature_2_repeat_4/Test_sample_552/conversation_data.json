    "This is an interesting historical question. The straightforward answer is that Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion (\"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\") famously contains no citations or references to other scientists' work at all.\n\nHowever, in another of his groundbreaking 1905 papers, the one on the photoelectric effect (\"Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt\"), he did cite a specific set of lectures. It is very likely this is the work your question is referring to. The scientist whose lectures he cited was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\nThe following Python script will print this information for you.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lectures():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides information about citations in Einstein's 1905 papers.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    paper_in_question = \"1905 paper on Brownian motion\"\n    cited_scientist_in_brownian_paper = \"None\"\n    \n    other_famous_paper = \"1905 paper on the photoelectric effect\"\n    cited_scientist_in_other_paper = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    cited_work = \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie (Lectures on Gas Theory)\"\n    \n    print(f\"Strictly speaking, in his {paper_in_question}, Albert Einstein cited {cited_scientist_in_brownian_paper}.\")\n    print(\"The paper is famous for not referencing prior work.\")\n    print(\"\\nHowever, in his {other_famous_paper} from the same year, Einstein did cite lectures from a key figure:\")\n    print(f\"\\nScientist: {cited_scientist_in_other_paper}\")\n    print(f\"Work Cited: {cited_work}\")\n    print(\"\\nBoltzmann's work was fundamental to the ideas in the Brownian motion paper, even though he was not formally cited within it.\")\n\nfind_cited_lectures()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
