    Based on the provided text, the core question is to identify the NCCN-recommended second-line treatment for HER2+ MBC after the first-line therapy (like trastuzumab and a taxane) fails.

    1. The text establishes that the standard first-line therapy is a combination including trastuzumab and a taxane (e.g., THP).
    2. The question asks what is recommended "after treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane," which means we are looking for the second-line therapy.
    3. The text provides a clear summary of the NCCN guidelines: "Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines with category 1 evidence recommend THP as the preferred first-line regimen for HER2+ MBC. Upon disease progression, TDXd is recommended in the second-line setting."
    4. TDXd is the abbreviation for fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan.
    5. This directly corresponds to answer choice C. The text also clarifies that T-DM1 (option B) was replaced by TDXd in this setting, and the tucatinib combination (option A) is recommended for third-line therapy.

    Therefore, the correct answer is C.
