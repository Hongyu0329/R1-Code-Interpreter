    Analyzes the poem to determine what it describes.

    # Step 1: Analyze the poem's key descriptions.
    # - "Naked, cold": This points to a low temperature and something forming on a bare surface.
    # - "She knits a veil": The metaphor of knitting or weaving suggests creating a delicate, intricate pattern.
    # - "from starwort, grass and meadowsweet": This specifies that the creation is happening on plants in a natural setting.
    # - "Sheâ€™s lace and glass": This is a powerful description. "Lace" reinforces the intricate pattern, while "glass" suggests something crystalline, fragile, transparent, and cold.
    # - "waits for pelted Autumn...to fray each feather stitch": This indicates the creation is ephemeral and will be destroyed by the advance of the Autumn season (e.g., by sun, wind, or rain).

    # Step 2: Evaluate the options against the analysis.
    # - C. A spider's web: While a web is lace-like, it is not inherently "cold" or "glass." This is a less perfect fit.
    # - Other options (B, D, E) are inconsistent with the poem's core imagery. A floodplain, hunter, or seamstress do not match the combination of nature, cold, and a glassy, lace-like structure.
    # - A. Frost patterns: This option aligns perfectly. Frost is cold. It forms intricate, lace-like crystalline patterns ("lace and glass") on plants. It is a signature feature of Autumn and is ephemeral, "fraying" or melting as the day warms or the weather changes.

    # Step 3: Conclude the findings.
    print("The poem uses personification to describe a natural phenomenon.")
    print("The clues 'cold,' 'knits a veil,' 'lace and glass,' and its fragile existence in Autumn all point towards one answer.")
    print("The subject is the intricate, lace-like patterns of frost that form on plants during the cold nights of Autumn.")
    
    # Final Answer
    print("<<<A>>>")
