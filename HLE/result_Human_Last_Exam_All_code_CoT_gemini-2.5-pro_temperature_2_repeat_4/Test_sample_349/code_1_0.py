    # 1. Understanding the problem setup
    # The problem statement defines a relationship: A = z * B - C
    # - A is a positive semidefinite matrix with unit diagonal (a correlation matrix).
    # - B is a "nice" matrix (the covariance matrix of unbiased +/-1 Bernoulli random variables).
    #   This implies B is also a correlation matrix of a specific kind (in the elliptope).
    # - C is a positive semidefinite matrix.
    # The condition is equivalent to z*B - A being positive semidefinite.
    
    # 2. Identifying the constant 'z'
    # The question asks for the smallest 'z' that makes this possible for ANY matrix A.
    # This value is, by one of its fundamental definitions, the real Grothendieck's
    # constant, K_G. It is a universal constant independent of the matrix dimension.
    # This is a classic result from the theory of operator spaces and semidefinite programming.

    # 3. Presenting the answer and the "final equation"
    # The final equation is A = z * B - C, where the value of z needs to be determined.
    # While we cannot calculate K_G's exact value, we can state what it is and its bounds.
    
    answer_symbol = "K_G"
    
    # The exact value of K_G is unknown, but tight bounds exist.
    kg_lower_bound = 1.67696
    kg_upper_bound = 1.78222 # A well-known upper bound, slightly rounded
