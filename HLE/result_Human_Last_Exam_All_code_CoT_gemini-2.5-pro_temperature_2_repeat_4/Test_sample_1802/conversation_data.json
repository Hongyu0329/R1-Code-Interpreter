    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process followed by the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). The answer should be provided as Python code that explains the derivation and calculates the result.\n\n2.  **Define Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Qudit:** A quantum system of dimension $d$. Its state is represented by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$.\n    *   **Pauli Channel ($\\Lambda$):** A type of quantum channel whose operation can be described using the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which we can label as $\\{U_i\\}_{i=1}^{d^2}$. The channel action is $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=1}^{d^2} p_i U_i \\rho U_i^\\dagger$, where $\\{p_i\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_i \\ge 0, \\sum p_i = 1$).\n    *   **Kraus Operators:** For any channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k A_k \\rho A_k^\\dagger$, the operators $A_k$ are the Kraus operators. For the Pauli channel, they are $A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$.\n    *   **Complementary Channel ($\\Lambda^c$):** This channel describes where the quantum information \"leaks\" to during the operation of $\\Lambda$.\n    *   **Rank of the Complementary Channel:** A fundamental result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel, $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c)$, is equal to the number of *linearly independent* Kraus operators required to represent the original channel $\\Lambda$. This is also known as the Choi rank of $\\Lambda$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   To find the maximal rank of $\\Lambda^c$, I need to find the maximum possible number of linearly independent Kraus operators for a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n    *   The Kraus operators are $A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$. Their linear independence depends on the properties of the operators $U_i$ and the probabilities $p_i$.\n    *   The set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_i\\}$ is a well-known operator basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices. This means they are linearly independent.\n    *   If the operators $\\{U_i\\}$ are linearly independent, then the Kraus operators $\\{A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i\\}$ are also linearly independent as long as their corresponding probability $p_i$ is greater than zero ($p_i > 0$).\n    *   Therefore, the number of linearly independent Kraus operators is simply the number of non-zero probabilities, $p_i$.\n    *   To maximize this number, we can define a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. A simple example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_i = 1/d^2$ for all $i=1, ..., d^2$.\n    *   This leads to the conclusion that the maximum number of linearly independent Kraus operators is $d^2$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Code:**\n    *   I will write a Python function that programmatically lays out this reasoning.\n    *   The code will not take any input, as per the instructions. It will first derive the answer for a general dimension `d` and then use a concrete example (e.g., `d=4`) to illustrate the final calculation, printing each number in the equation as requested.\n    *   The final output of the code will clearly state that the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\nThis plan directly addresses the user's question while adhering to all the specified formatting constraints.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pauli_channel_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the maximal rank of the complementary\n    channel of a Pauli channel for a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n\n    The final answer is presented as a formula in terms of 'd', and then\n    calculated for a specific example.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The maximal rank will be a function of the qudit dimension, d.\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step Derivation:\")\n    print(\"-------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 1: Pauli Channel and Kraus Operators\n    print(\"1.
