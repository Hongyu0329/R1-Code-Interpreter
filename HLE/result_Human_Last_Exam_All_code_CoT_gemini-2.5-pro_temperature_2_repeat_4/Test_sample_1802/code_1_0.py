    print("-------------------------")

    # Step 1: Pauli Channel and Kraus Operators
    print("1. A d-dimensional Pauli channel Λ is defined by d^2 generalized Pauli operators, {U_i}.")
    print("   The action of the channel on a density matrix ρ is: Λ(ρ) = Σ p_i * U_i * ρ * U_i†")
    print("   where p_i are probabilities (p_i ≥ 0 and Σ p_i = 1).")
    print("   The Kraus operators of this channel are A_i = sqrt(p_i) * U_i.")
    print("")

    # Step 2: Complementary Channel Rank
    print("2. The rank of the complementary channel, Λ^c, is equal to the number of")
    print("   linearly independent Kraus operators {A_i} in the channel's representation.")
    print("")

    # Step 3: Linear Independence of Kraus Operators
    print("3. The d^2 generalized Pauli operators {U_i} form a complete orthogonal basis")
    print("   for the space of d x d matrices. A key property of a basis is that its elements are linearly independent.")
    print("   Since A_i = sqrt(p_i) * U_i, the Kraus operators A_i for which p_i > 0")
    print("   are also linearly independent.")
    print("")

    # Step 4: Maximizing the Rank
    print("4. The rank of Λ^c is therefore the number of non-zero probabilities p_i.")
    print("   To maximize this rank, we must maximize the number of non-zero p_i values.")
    print("   A valid channel can be constructed where all d^2 probabilities are non-zero")
    print("   (e.g., the depolarizing channel, where p_i = 1/d^2 for all d^2 operators).")
    print("")

    # Conclusion
    print("5. Therefore, the maximum number of linearly independent Kraus operators is d^2.")
    print("   This means the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a d-dimensional Pauli channel is d^2.")
