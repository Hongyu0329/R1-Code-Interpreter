    "Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The user wants to know the \"most likely\" mechanism for the \"retention\" and \"divergence\" of duplicated genes. This means I need to evaluate which of the given options best explains why a redundant gene copy isn't lost and how it becomes different from its original counterpart.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process tends to make gene copies more similar (homogenize), which opposes divergence. It's not a primary mechanism for retention. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the *loss* of function in a gene copy. It is a failure of retention, not the mechanism of retention. This is incorrect.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This describes the diversification of species, which is a macroevolutionary pattern. The question is about a molecular mechanism within a genome. This is the wrong level of biological organization and is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Compare the Plausible Options (C and D):** This leaves two strong candidates:\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** One copy gains a totally new, beneficial function. The original gene copy keeps the old function. This perfectly explains both retention (the new function is useful) and divergence (the gene's sequence changes to support the new function).\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** The original gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy specializes, taking on a subset of the original roles. This also perfectly explains retention (both copies are now needed to cover the original functionality) and divergence (each copy loses the parts of the gene related to the functions it no longer performs).\n\n4.  **Determine the \"Most Likely\":** The key differentiator is the phrase \"most likely.\"\n    *   Neofunctionalization depends on a *rare* beneficial, gain-of-function mutation occurring before the redundant copy is silenced by other random mutations.\n    *   Subfunctionalization can happen through *common*, selectively neutral mutations that degrade different parts of the two gene copies. Because the underlying mutational events are more probable, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more common, or \"likely,\" initial fate that preserves both gene copies from being lost. It provides a stable state where the duplicates are both kept, and from which one copy might eventually neofunctionalize.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically lays out this logical deduction. The script will define each term, eliminate the incorrect answers, compare the two strong candidates based on the \"most likely\" criterion, and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes a multiple-choice question about the fate of duplicate genes,\n    explains the reasoning for each option, and determines the most likely answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion: A process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between similar sequences. It often leads to homogenization, which opposes divergence, rather than being a primary driver for retaining two distinct genes.',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization: The process where a gene loses its function.

This also explains retention and divergence and relies on more common degenerative mutations.',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation: A species-level process of diversification into new ecological niches.
