def solve_violin_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the violin acoustics puzzle.

    The solution is derived as follows:
    1.  'sul ponticello' (variation 1) emphasizes high harmonics, which corresponds to parameter group 'ii' (nu).
    2.  A bridge mute (variation 2) adds mass and damping to the bridge, lowering the main body resonance frequency (f1) and changing its amplitude (a1). This corresponds to group 'iii' (a1, f1). The added mass causes the frequency f1 to go 'down'.
    3.  A helium environment (variation 3) increases the speed of sound, which shifts the air resonances of the violin to higher frequencies, affecting the high-frequency response. This corresponds to group 'iv' (mu, a2, f2).
    4.  Playing on the E string (variation 4) instead of the A string changes the fundamental open-string frequency 'F', which corresponds to group 'i'.

    The final answer is the sequence of group IDs followed by the direction of change for variation 2.
