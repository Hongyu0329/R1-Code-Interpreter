    "In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the Nash Equilibrium is for both players to defect, leading to a suboptimal outcome of (1, 1) for them. However, when the game is played in a quantum setting using an entangled initial state, new strategies become available that can lead to a more favorable equilibrium.\n\nMy plan to find the equilibrium is as follows:\n1.  **Model the Game:** I will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, a standard model for quantum games. In this model, players' strategies are not simple choices but unitary transformations (quantum gates) applied to a shared entangled state.\n2.  **Define Strategies:**\n    *   The classical strategies \"Cooperate\" (C) and \"Defect\" (D) can be represented by specific quantum gates (the Identity matrix `I` and the Pauli-X matrix `σ_x`, respectively).\n    *   A special quantum-only strategy, let's call it `Q` (represented by the Pauli-Z matrix `σ_z`), exists that is not available in the classical game.\n3.  **Calculate Payoffs:** I will calculate the expected payoff for the players when both choose the quantum strategy `Q`. The calculation involves:\n    a. Starting with an initial entangled state.\n    b. Applying the players' chosen strategy gates (`Q ⊗ Q`).\n    c. Disentangling the state.\n    d. Measuring the final state to get the probabilities of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD).\n    e. Calculating the expected payoff using these probabilities and the original payoff matrix.\n4.  **Identify Equilibrium:** I will show that the strategy pair `(Q, Q)` constitutes a new Nash Equilibrium. At this equilibrium, neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy, and it results in the best possible outcome for both (`(5,5)`), thus resolving the dilemma.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation using NumPy. It defines the strategies and the quantum game setup and then computes the resulting payoffs for the quantum equilibrium point `(Q, Q)`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff Matrix values: R (Reward), S (Sucker), T (Temptation), P (Punishment)\n    # Corresponding to (C,C), (C,D), (D,C), (D,D)\n    # Player A is the row player, Player B is the column player.\n    # Payoff for A: (R, S, T, P) = (5, 0, 7, 1)\n    # Payoff for B: (R, T, S, P) = (5, 7, 0, 1)\n    R, S, T, P = 5, 0, 7, 1\n\n    # Define standard 2x2 matrices (quantum gates)\n    I = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=complex)\n    sigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n    sigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # --- Define Player Strategies as Unitary Matrices ---\n    # Cooperate (C) is the identity operator\n    C_gate = I\n    # Defect (D) is a bit-flip.
