    print("A. Quantum Encryption: Uses qubits as keys. If the adversary has 'complete knowledge' of the keys, they know the state of these qubits. Security is compromised.")
    print("B. Fast Key Rotation: Limits the *damage* of a key compromise. The adversary can still decrypt any message for which they know the key; that key is just not valid for very long. It doesn't secure the communication *at the moment of compromise*.")

    print("Step 4: Formulate a conclusion.")
    print("All options from A to E describe methods that either try to prevent key disclosure or limit the damage of a disclosure. None of them can maintain security in a situation where the key is actively known by an attacker.")
