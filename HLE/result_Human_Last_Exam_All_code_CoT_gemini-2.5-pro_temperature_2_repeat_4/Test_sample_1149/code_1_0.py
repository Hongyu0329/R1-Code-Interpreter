# Based on paleontological descriptions (e.g., Sues et al., 2002),
# the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri is divided by a vertical septum.
# This creates depressions on either side of the septum.

# Number of depressions on the first side of the septum.
depressions_side_1 = 1

# Number of depressions on the second side of the septum.
depressions_side_2 = 1

# Calculate the total number of depressions by adding the depressions from both sides.
total_depressions = depressions_side_1 + depressions_side_2

# The final equation shows how the total is reached.
# The prompt requires showing each number in the final equation.
