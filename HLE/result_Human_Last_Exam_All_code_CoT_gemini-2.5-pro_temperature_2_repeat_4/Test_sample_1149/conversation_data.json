    "Based on my research, the answer to this question can be found in the scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The most prominent description notes that a thin wall of bone, a septum, divides the lacrimal recess.\n\nHere is my plan to provide the answer using a Python script:\n1.  I will represent the number of depressions on each side of the central septum as variables.\n2.  I will then write a simple equation to sum these parts to find the total number of depressions.\n3.  The script will print out the full equation and the final answer, fulfilling the request to show all numbers involved.\n\n```python\n# Based on paleontological descriptions (e.g., Sues et al., 2002),\n# the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri is divided by a vertical septum.\n# This creates depressions on either side of the septum.\n\n# Number of depressions on the first side of the septum.\ndepressions_side_1 = 1\n\n# Number of depressions on the second side of the septum.\ndepressions_side_2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions by adding the depressions from both sides.\ntotal_depressions = depressions_side_1 + depressions_side_2\n\n# The final equation shows how the total is reached.\n# The prompt requires showing each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{depressions_side_1} + {depressions_side_2} = {total_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
