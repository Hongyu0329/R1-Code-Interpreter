    print("1. The combination of LUQ pain and left shoulder pain (Kehr's sign) after a difficult colonoscopy strongly suggests splenic injury due to traction on the splenocolic ligament.")
    print("2. The rapid drop in hemoglobin (from 11.7 to 6.5) and development of shock (tachycardia, hypotension) indicate massive, acute intra-abdominal hemorrhage.")
    print("3. Increasing abdominal distension and peritoneal signs point to blood accumulating in the peritoneal cavity (hemoperitoneum).")
    print("4. Colonic perforation is less likely as the primary feature is massive hemorrhage, not infection. Lower GI bleeding is ruled out as the bleeding is in the abdomen, not into the bowel lumen. Postpolypectomy syndrome is ruled out as no polypectomy was performed.")
