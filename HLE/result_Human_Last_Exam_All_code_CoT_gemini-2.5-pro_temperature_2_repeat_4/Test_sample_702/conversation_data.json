    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow a step-by-step plan. The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n1.  Determine the connectivity of the source space $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This will give us a baseline for the connectivity of the map.\n2.  Analyze the induced map $f_*$ on the first non-trivial homotopy groups of these spaces.\n3.  Based on whether this map is surjective, we can determine the connectivity. We will refer to known general results from homotopy theory to determine the nature of this map.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out these calculations and print the reasoning at each step.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the connectivity of the specified topological map by\n    analyzing the connectivity of the involved spaces and the induced map\n    on their first non-trivial homotopy groups.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces ---\\n\")\n\n    # For the source space X = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6)\n    print(\"Source space calculation:\")\n    conn_omega_s4 = 4 - 2\n    conn_omega_s6 = 6 - 2\n    print(f\"The loop space Omega S^4 is (4 - 2) = {conn_omega_s4}-connected.\")\n    print(f\"The loop space Omega S^6 is (6 - 2) = {conn_omega_s6}-connected.\")\n\n    p, q = conn_omega_s4, conn_omega_s6\n    conn_smash_of_loops = p + q + 1\n    print(f\"The smash product (Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) of a {p}-connected and {q}-connected space is ({p} + {q} + 1) = {conn_smash_of_loops}-connected.\")\n\n    conn_X = conn_smash_of_loops + 1\n    print(f\"The suspension of a {conn_smash_of_loops}-connected space is ({conn_smash_of_loops} + 1) = {conn_X}-connected.\")\n    print(f\"Result: The source space X is {conn_X}-connected.\\n\")\n    \n    # For the target space Y = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\n    print(\"Target space calculation:\")\n    smash_dim = 4 + 6\n    conn_Y = smash_dim - 2\n    print(f\"The target space Y is Omega(S^4 wedge S^6), which is homeomorphic to Omega(S^{smash_dim}).\")\n    print(f\"The loop space Omega S^{smash_dim} is ({smash_dim} - 2) = {conn_Y}-connected.\")\n    print(f\"Result: The target space Y is {conn_Y}-connected.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Analyze the map on low-dimensional homotopy groups ---\\n\")\n\n    k = 8\n    print(f\"Both the source X and target Y are {k}-connected.
