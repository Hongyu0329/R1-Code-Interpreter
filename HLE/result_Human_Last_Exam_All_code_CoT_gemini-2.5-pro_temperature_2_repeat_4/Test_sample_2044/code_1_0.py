    explanation = """
In the rat olfactory bulb, there is a well-established 'chemotopic' map where glomeruli are organized based on the chemical features of odorants.
One of the most prominent organizational principles relates to the carbon chain length of aliphatic odorants.

- Odorants with a short carbon chain activate glomeruli in the anterior region of the olfactory bulb.
- As the carbon chain length increases, the corresponding site of glomerular activation shifts progressively towards the posterior region.

Let's evaluate the choices based on this principle:
A. Long chain molecules tended to be processed more anteriorly in the olfactory bulb - Incorrect.
B. Long chain molecules tended to be processed more posteriorly in the olfactory bulb - Correct.
C. Short chain molecules tended to be processed more anteriorly in the olfactory bulb - Also correct, as it describes the start of the gradient.
D. Long chain molecules tended to be processed more superiorly in the olfactory bulb - Incorrect axis.
E. Long chain molecules tended to be processed more inferiorly in the olfactory bulb - Incorrect axis.

Both B and C describe the same biological phenomenon. However, option B describes the trend as the chain length *increases*, which is a comprehensive way to state the rule of organization. Thus, it is often considered the best description.
