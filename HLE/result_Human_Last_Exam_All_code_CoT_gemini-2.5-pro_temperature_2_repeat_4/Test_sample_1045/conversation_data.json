    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecule:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Understand the basis set (6-31G):**\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The `1s` orbital is a valence orbital. The `31G` part means this valence orbital is described by two contracted functions (a \"split-valence\" representation): one function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian. So, each H atom contributes **2** contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The `6-` part describes the core orbitals (`1s`). It is represented by **1** contracted function, which is a combination of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The `-31G` part describes the valence orbitals (`2s` and `2p`). They are split into two parts:\n            *   An \"inner\" part (`2s` and `2p`) represented by contracted functions made of 3 primitives each. This gives 1 s-function and 3 p-functions, for a total of **4** contracted functions.\n            *   An \"outer\" part (`2s` and `2p`) represented by contracted functions made of 1 primitive each. This gives another 1 s-function and 3 p-functions, for a total of **4** contracted functions.\n        *   Therefore, each Carbon atom contributes 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We multiply the number of atoms of each type by the number of functions they contribute and then sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon: 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence s,p) + 4 (outer valence s,p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen: 1 (inner valence s) + 1 (outer valence s) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Print the final calculation and result\nprint(f\"For toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"The total number of contracted basis functions is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"= ({total_carbon_functions}) + ({total_hydrogen_functions})\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
