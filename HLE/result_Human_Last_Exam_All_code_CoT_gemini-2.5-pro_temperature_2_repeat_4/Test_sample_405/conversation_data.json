    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the task.\n\nFirst, I will identify the well-known allotropes of phosphorus. Then, for each allotrope, I will determine its observable color or colors. Finally, I will write a Python script that lists these unique colors, counts them, and prints the result as a sum to show how the total number is calculated.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each distinct color to the allotrope(s) that exhibit it.\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White\": \"White Phosphorus\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"White Phosphorus (when exposed to light)\",\n        \"Red\": \"Red Phosphorus\",\n        \"Violet\": \"Violet (Hittorf's) Phosphorus\",\n        \"Black\": \"Black Phosphorus\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The main colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    # Print each color and its corresponding allotrope.\n    for color, name in allotropes.items():\n        print(f\"- {color} (from {name})\")\n\n    # Get the total number of distinct colors.\n    num_colors = len(allotropes)\n    \n    # Create the equation string as a sum of 1s.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * num_colors\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the total number of distinct colors:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\n# Run the function to display the result.\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
