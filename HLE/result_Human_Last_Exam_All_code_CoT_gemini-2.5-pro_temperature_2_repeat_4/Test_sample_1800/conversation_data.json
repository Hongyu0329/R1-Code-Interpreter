    "Of course. Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic reactions is a complex problem that depends on various factors like synthesis method and reaction conditions. An exact answer requires extensive experimental work. However, by reviewing scientific literature, we can find a generally accepted optimal range.\n\nHere is my plan to provide an answer:\n1.  **Acknowledge Complexity:** The ideal ratio is not a single value but typically a range. It is influenced by the need to maximize the interface between Ni nanoparticles and the Ceria (CeO2) support, while avoiding the sintering (clumping) of Ni particles at high temperatures.\n2.  **Synthesize Literature Findings:** Based on numerous studies, a relatively low Ni loading is often found to be most effective. This creates highly dispersed Ni active sites and enhances the metal-support interaction, which is crucial for the catalytic mechanism.\n3.  **Develop Python Code:** I will write a Python script that stores these findings in a data structure. The script will then print a summary for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions, presenting the optimal atomic ratio ranges and the scientific reasoning behind them. The code will explicitly print the numbers involved in the conclusion, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to present the findings:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Summarizes findings from scientific literature on the ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio\n    for Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Data synthesized from common findings in catalysis research.\n    # The ratio is atomic (molar), not by weight.\n    catalysis_data = {\n        \"Water Gas Shift (WGS)\": {\n            \"lower_ratio\": 0.1,\n            \"upper_ratio\": 0.25,\n            \"reason\": \"Maximizes the active Ni-CeO2 interface perimeter sites, which are key for the reaction mechanism, while preventing the formation of less active bulk NiO.\"\n        },\n        \"Water Splitting (WS)\": {\n            \"lower_ratio\": 0.15,\n            \"upper_ratio\": 0.33,\n            \"reason\": \"Provides a high density of active sites and strong metal-support interaction, which improves catalyst stability and prevents Ni particle sintering at high operating temperatures.\"\n        },\n        \"conclusion\": \"A low Ni/Ce atomic ratio is generally optimal to ensure high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and leverage the synergistic effects at the metal-support interface.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Ideal Ni/Ce Atomic Ratio in Ni-Ceria Catalysts ---\")\n\n    # Display results for WGS\n    wgs = catalysis_data[\"Water Gas Shift (WGS)\"]\n    lr_wgs = wgs['lower_ratio']\n    ur_wgs = wgs['upper_ratio']\n    print(\"\\n[For Water Gas Shift Reaction]\")\n    print(f\"Optimal Range Equation: {lr_wgs} <= (Ni/Ce) <= {ur_wgs}\")\n    print(f\"Reasoning: {wgs['reason']}\")\n\n    # Display results for WS\n    ws = catalysis_data[\"Water Splitting (WS)\"]\n    lr_ws = ws['lower_ratio']\n    ur_ws = ws['upper_ratio']\n    print(\"\\n[For Water Splitting Reaction]\")\n    print(f\"Optimal Range Equation: {lr_ws} <= (Ni/Ce) <= {ur_ws}\")\n    print(f\"Reasoning: {ws['reason']}\")\n    \n    # Display overall conclusion\n    print(\"\\n[Overall Conclusion]\")\n    print(catalysis_data[\"conclusion\"])\n\n# Execute the function to print the analysis\nfind_ideal_ni_ce_ratio()\n\n```\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but a range that depends on the specific reaction. For WGS, it is typically an atomic ratio of 0.1 to 0.25. For water splitting, a slightly higher range of 0.15 to 0.33 is often optimal to enhance stability at higher temperatures. In general, a low Ni loading is preferred to maximize catalytic performance.>>>"
