The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but a range that depends on the specific reaction. For WGS, it is typically an atomic ratio of 0.1 to 0.25. For water splitting, a slightly higher range of 0.15 to 0.33 is often optimal to enhance stability at higher temperatures. In general, a low Ni loading is preferred to maximize catalytic performance.
