    explanation = """
    The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is a profound, non-perturbative principle in quantum field theory. It states that the anomaly associated with any global symmetry must be the same in the high-energy (UV) fundamental theory and the low-energy (IR) effective theory.

    This matching must hold because the anomaly is a robust quantity that is invariant under continuous changes to the theory, such as changing particle masses. The flow from the UV to the IR is such a continuous process.

    The primary physical implication of this condition is that it imposes a powerful consistency check on the low-energy description of the system. If you know the fundamental theory (e.g., quarks and gluons in QCD), you can calculate its 't Hooft anomalies. Any proposed low-energy effective theory (e.g., a theory of mesons and baryons) is then severely constrained because it MUST reproduce those exact same anomalies.

    This constraint manifests in specific ways:
    1.  It dictates the necessary low-energy degrees of freedom. The IR theory must contain particles (like massless composite fermions or Nambu-Goldstone bosons) with the right properties to generate the anomaly.
    2.  It guides the possible patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking. A proposed symmetry breaking pattern can be ruled out if its resulting Goldstone bosons cannot reproduce the anomaly correctly via a Wess-Zumino-Witten term.

    In essence, the condition provides a powerful tool to test the validity of a proposed low-energy theory and constrain its structure without having to solve the full dynamics of the theory.
