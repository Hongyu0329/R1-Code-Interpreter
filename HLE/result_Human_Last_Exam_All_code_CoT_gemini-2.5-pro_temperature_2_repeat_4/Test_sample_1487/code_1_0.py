# This script calculates the final value of the expression from the problem.

# According to the derivation, the expression simplifies to the sum of two terms.

# The first term is 1025 squared.
term1 = 1025**2

# The second term is 10 to the power of 15.
term2 = 10**15

# The final result is the sum of these two terms.
result = term1 + term2

# The final equation consists of these three numbers.
# We will print the equation with its full numerical values.
print("The final simplified equation is:")
print(f"{term1} + {term2} = {result}")
