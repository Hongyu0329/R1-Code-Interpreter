    "To answer this question, I will identify the historical mountains explicitly mentioned by name in Homer's Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus. Then, I will compare their real-world elevations to find the tallest among them.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will compile a list of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad, such as Mount Ida (near Troy), Mount Athos, Mount Samothrace, and Mount Tmolus.\n2.  I will find the modern-day elevation for each of these mountains.\n3.  I will write a Python script to store these mountains and their elevations in a dictionary.\n4.  The script will iterate through the dictionary, printing each mountain and its height for comparison, and determine which one is the tallest.\n5.  Finally, the script will print a concluding sentence stating the tallest mountain and its elevation.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_tallest_mountain_in_iliad():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, besides Mount Olympus.\n    The elevations are in meters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida (Trojan)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace (Peak: Fengari)\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Tmolus\": 2159,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad (excluding Olympus):\")\n\n    # Find the tallest mountain\n    # The max function with a key is a concise way to find the dictionary item with the highest value\n    if not mountains:\n        print(\"No mountains listed for comparison.\")\n        return\n\n    # To fulfill the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement,\n    # we'll first print all candidates. The comparison logic is effectively the \"equation\".\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} meters\")\n\n    tallest_mountain_name, tallest_mountain_height = max(mountains.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))\n\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The tallest among these is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain_in_iliad()\n```\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
