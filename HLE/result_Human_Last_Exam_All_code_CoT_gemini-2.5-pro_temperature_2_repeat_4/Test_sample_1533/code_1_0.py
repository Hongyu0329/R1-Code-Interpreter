    Calculates the ratio BM/MI for a triangle with side lengths a, b, c.

    The angle bisector of angle B (opposite side b) intersects the circumcircle
    at M and the incenter at I. The formula for the ratio BM/MI is (a+c)/b.

    Args:
        a: Length of the side opposite to vertex A.
        b: Length of the side opposite to vertex B.
        c: Length of the side opposite to vertex C.

        sides do not form a valid triangle.
