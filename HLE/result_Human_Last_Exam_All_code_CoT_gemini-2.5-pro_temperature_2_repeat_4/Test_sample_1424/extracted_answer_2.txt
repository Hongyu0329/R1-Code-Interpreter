The bare Green's function for a state with quantum number k, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ through the expression $G_0(k, \omega) = (\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta)^{-1}$, where the pole of the function in the frequency domain is located at the energy $\epsilon_k$.
