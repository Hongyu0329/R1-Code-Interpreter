    "In the Feynman path integral formalism and quantum many-body theory, the bare Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is fundamental to the theory.\n\nThe relationship is most clearly expressed in frequency-momentum space. In this representation, the Green's function $G_0$ is a function of a quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum) and a frequency $\\omega$ (related to energy). The functional dependence is given by the following expression (in the commonly used zero-temperature formalism):\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - E_F)}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms and the dependence:\n*   **$\\epsilon_k$**: This is the energy of a single-particle state with quantum number $k$.\n*   **$\\omega$**: This is the frequency (or energy) variable of the propagating particle.\n*   **$E_F$**: This is the Fermi energy, the energy of the highest occupied state at zero temperature.\n*   **$i\\eta$**: This is an infinitesimally small imaginary part, crucial for defining the correct time-ordering and handling the pole in the denominator. The sign is determined by whether the state $\\epsilon_k$ is above or below the Fermi level.\n\nThe key aspects of the functional dependence are:\n1.  **Pole Structure**: The function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a mathematical pole where the denominator approaches zero, which happens when $\\omega \\approx \\epsilon_k$. This means the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ directly define the energies at which the system's elementary excitations (the non-interacting particles) exist.\n2.  **Local Dependence**: The Green's function for a specific state $k$, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, depends only on the energy eigenvalue of that same state, $\\epsilon_k$. It does not depend on the energies of other states, $\\epsilon_{k'}$ where $k' \\neq k$.\n\nTo provide a concrete example, the following Python script calculates the value of the bare Green's function for a given set of parameters, showing step-by-step how its value is determined by $\\epsilon_k$. For simplicity, we will use the form $G_0 = 1 / (\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta)$, which is valid for states above the Fermi level ($\\epsilon_k > E_F$) or when analyzing the system's response to adding a particle.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_green_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω).\n\n    This function demonstrates the dependence of G_0 on the single-particle\n    energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency (energy) of the particle.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        eta (float): A small positive infinitesimal for broadening/causality.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the complex value of G_0 and the denominator.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The denominator of the Green's function formula, which shows the\n    # direct dependence on the difference between ω and ϵ_k.\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    \n    # The Green's function is the inverse of the denominator.\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n    return G0, denominator\n\n# --- Example Parameters ---\n# Let's assume energy units are in eV (electron-volts)\nomega = 2.0      # An example frequency (energy of observation)\nepsilon_k = 1.5  # The energy of the single-particle state k\neta = 0.1        # A small positive constant representing lifetime effects or for calculation purposes\n\n# --- Calculation ---\nG0_result, denominator_result = calculate_bare_green_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta)\n\n# --- Output the Explanation and Final Equation ---\nprint(\"This script calculates the bare Green's function G_0.\")\nprint(\"The functional dependence of G_0 on the single-particle energy ϵ_k is given by the formula:\")\nprint(\"G_0(ω, ϵ_k) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Print each number used in the final equation\nprint(\"Given the parameters:\")\nprint(f\"  Frequency ω          = {omega}\")\nprint(f\"  Single-particle ϵ_k  = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"  Broadening factor η  = {eta}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate the denominator of the equation.\")\n# We use .real and .imag to explicitly show the numbers that form the complex denominator\nprint(f\"Denominator = (ω - ϵ_k) + iη\")\nprint(f\"Denominator = ({omega} - {epsilon_k}) + {eta}j\")\nprint(f\"Denominator = {denominator_result.real} + {denominator_result.imag}j\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate G_0 by taking the inverse of the denominator.\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({denominator_result})\")\nprint(f\"Final Result: G_0 = {G0_result}\")\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function for a state with quantum number k, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ through the expression $G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta)^{-1}$, where the pole of the function in the frequency domain is located at the energy $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
