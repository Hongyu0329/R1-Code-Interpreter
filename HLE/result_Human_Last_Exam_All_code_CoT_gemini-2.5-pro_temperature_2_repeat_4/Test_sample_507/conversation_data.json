    "This is a fascinating linguistic puzzle. The key is finding languages that are geographically distant and from completely different language families, yet show coincidental similarities. The words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are often similar across unrelated languages (a phenomenon known as nursery words), but finding a match for an arbitrary word like \"broom\" is the real challenge.\n\nHere is a proposed solution based on one of the most famous examples of linguistic coincidence in Asia, supplemented with a plausible similarity for the third word.\n\nThe two languages are **Korean** and **Tamil**.\n\n*   **Cultures & Contact:** The Korean culture of East Asia and the Tamil (Dravidian) culture of South India have no significant direct historical contact. They belong to entirely separate language families (Koreanic and Dravidian, respectively).\n*   **Word Similarity:** The words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are strikingly similar. The similarity for \"broom\" is more structural and subtle but still notable.\n\nThe python script below will print the detailed comparison.\n\n```python\ndef solve_linguistic_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the two Asian languages with similar words for \"mom\", \"dad\", and \"broom\".\n    \"\"\"\n    lang1_name = \"Korean\"\n    lang1_culture = \"Korean (East Asia)\"\n    lang2_name = \"Tamil\"\n    lang2_culture = \"Tamil (South Asia, Dravidian)\"\n\n    word1 = \"mom\"\n    lang1_word1 = \"eomma (엄마)\"\n    lang2_word1 = \"amma (அம்மா)\"\n\n    word2 = \"dad\"\n    lang1_word2 = \"appa (아빠)\"\n    lang2_word2 = \"appa (அப்பா)\"\n\n    word3 = \"broom\"\n    lang1_word3 = \"bitjaru (빗자루)\"\n    lang2_word3 = \"vilakkumaaru (விளக்குமாறு)\"\n\n    print(\"This puzzle requires finding two languages from different Asian cultures with no direct contact that share similar words.\")\n    print(\"The chosen languages are Korean and Tamil.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Language 1: {lang1_name} (Culture: {lang1_culture})\")\n    print(f\"Language 2: {lang2_name} (Culture: {lang2_culture})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Here is the comparison of the words:\\n\")\n\n    # --- MOM ---\n    print(f\"WORD: '{word1.upper()}'\")\n    print(f\"{lang1_name}: {lang1_word1}\")\n    print(f\"{lang2_name}:   {lang2_word1}\")\n    print(\"Similarity Analysis: The words are nearly identical, both using the simple labial 'm' sound typical of nursery words for 'mother'.\\n\")\n\n    # --- DAD ---\n    print(f\"WORD: '{word2.upper()}'\")\n    print(f\"{lang1_name}: {lang1_word2}\")\n    print(f\"{lang2_name}:   {lang2_word2}\")\n    print(\"Similarity Analysis: The words are identical.
