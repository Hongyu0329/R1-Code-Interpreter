def solve_safe_goal():

    This function determines the safe goal for the model M.

    The model cannot prove future predictive success due to uncomputability.
    Therefore, its safest goal is not to find a provably 'correct' predictor,
    but to learn a strategy for selecting predictors that maximizes success over time.
    This process of learning from reward signals (correct/incorrect prediction)
    is best described as Reinforcement learning. The information used for this
    learning is the success or failure of its own predictions, which is a form of
    predictive feedback.
