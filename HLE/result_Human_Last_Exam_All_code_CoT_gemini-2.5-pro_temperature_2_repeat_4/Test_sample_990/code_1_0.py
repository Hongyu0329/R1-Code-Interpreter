# The problem is to find the time it takes for a raindrop to fall 350g meters
# while accumulating mass.

# From analyzing the physics of the system, it can be derived that the
# raindrop falls with a constant acceleration 'a'.
# The acceleration is found to be a = g / 7.

# The initial height 'h' is given as 350g meters.
# We use the standard kinematic equation for an object falling from rest:
# h = (1/2) * a * t^2
# We can solve for the time 't':
# t = sqrt(2 * h / a)

# Now, we substitute the expressions for h and a:
# t = sqrt(2 * (350 * g) / (g / 7))
# As you can see, the gravitational acceleration 'g' cancels from the equation.
# t = sqrt(2 * 350 * 7)
# t = sqrt(14 * 350)

# The numbers in the final calculation for the time squared are 14 and 350.
num1 = 14
num2 = 350

# Calculate the result
time_squared = num1 * num2
time = math.sqrt(time_squared)

# As requested, we print the numbers in the final equation and the result.
