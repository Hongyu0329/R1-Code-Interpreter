    We have two bacterial populations. Bacterium 1 uses lateral gene transfer, which is like sharing a cheat sheet, allowing for the very rapid spread of resistance. Bacterium 2 must rely on rare, random mutations, which is like trying to write a new cheat sheet from scratch. The puzzle is that they both acquire resistance at the same pace.

    explanation = """
    For Bacterium 2 to match the pace, its mutational path must be incredibly effective. Let's break down the components of the best answer (Choice B):

    1.  Rare Resistance Mutation: A single, chance mutation occurs that grants resistance to a drug.

    2.  Fitness Cost and Compensatory Mutations: This initial resistance mutation often makes the bacterium less 'fit' (e.g., it grows slower). To spread effectively, the population needs secondary 'compensatory' mutations that fix this problem, restoring the bacterium's fitness and allowing it to out-compete its non-resistant peers.

    3.  Cross-Resistance: The initial mutation doesn't just grant resistance to one drug, but to several at once. This is a huge evolutionary leap, dramatically accelerating the 'pace' at which the population becomes resistant to a range of threats.

    Choice B is the only one that combines these powerful mechanisms. The synergy between acquiring multi-drug cross-resistance and then fixing the associated fitness cost with compensatory mutations provides a complete explanation for how a population relying on de novo mutation can rival one using lateral gene transfer.
