# The correct procedure for isolating corneal fibroblasts is described in option C.
# This option mentions specific concentrations for supplements in the cell culture medium.
# We will define these values and print them in an equation format.

fbs_percentage = 10  # Percentage of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)
antibiotic_percentage = 1  # Percentage of antibiotic solution

# Calculate the total percentage of these key supplements in the medium.
total_supplement_percentage = fbs_percentage + antibiotic_percentage

# Display the values from the correct procedure in a clear equation.
