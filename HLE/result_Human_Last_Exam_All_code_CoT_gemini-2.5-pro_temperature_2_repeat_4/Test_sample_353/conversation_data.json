    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  The A($\\alpha$)-stability angle, $\\alpha$, is determined by the maximum angle a ray from the origin can make with the negative real axis while remaining within the stability region of the numerical method. This angle is limited by rays that are tangent to the stability boundary.\n2.  The points of tangency from the origin on the stability boundary are generated by specific complex numbers, $\\xi_0$. These numbers are the roots of the equation $\\rho(\\xi)\\sigma'(\\xi) - \\rho'(\\xi)\\sigma(\\xi) = 0$, where $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the numerical method. For BDF methods, the relevant roots $\\xi_0$ lie inside the unit disk ($|\\xi_0|<1$).\n3.  First, I will define the characteristic polynomials for the BDF4 scheme, $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$.\n4.  Then, I will set up and solve the algebraic equation $\\rho(\\xi)\\sigma'(\\xi) - \\rho'(\\xi)\\sigma(\\xi) = 0$ to find the critical roots $\\xi_0$.\n5.  Using the complex root that lies inside the unit circle, I will calculate the corresponding point of tangency on the stability boundary, $z_0 = \\rho(\\xi_0) / \\sigma(\\xi_0)$.\n6.  The angle $\\alpha$ is related to the argument of this point $z_0$. Since $z_0$ is in the left half-plane, its argument is $\\arg(z_0) = \\pi - \\alpha$. This allows us to find $\\tan(\\alpha)$ from the real and imaginary parts of $z_0$.\n7.  The final result for $\\alpha$ will be expressed in terms of the $\\arctan()$ function as requested. I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    The method follows these steps:\n    1.
