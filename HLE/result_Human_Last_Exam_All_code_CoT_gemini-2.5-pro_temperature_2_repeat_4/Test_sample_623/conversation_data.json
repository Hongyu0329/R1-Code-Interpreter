    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Molecule**: We begin with a glucose molecule where the carbon atoms at position 1 and position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. The glucose structure is a 6-carbon chain.\n2.  **Define the Metabolic Pathway**: The question strictly specifies the pathway as **glycolysis**. Glycolysis is the metabolic process that converts one molecule of glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) into two molecules of pyruvate (a 3-carbon molecule).\n3.  **Examine the Overall Reaction of Glycolysis**: The net chemical reaction for glycolysis is:\n    Glucose + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n4.  **Check for CO₂ Production**: Notice that in the products of the glycolysis reaction, there is no carbon dioxide (CO₂). All six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are conserved in the two resulting pyruvate molecules. CO₂ is only released in later stages of cellular respiration, such as the link reaction (pyruvate decarboxylation) and the Krebs cycle.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since the process of glycolysis does not release any carbon dioxide, it is impossible for it to release any ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\nThe following Python code states this conclusion and provides the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_glycolysis_co2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules released when\n    1,4-13C glucose goes through glycolysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the labeled glucose.\n    # Glucose has 6 carbons.
