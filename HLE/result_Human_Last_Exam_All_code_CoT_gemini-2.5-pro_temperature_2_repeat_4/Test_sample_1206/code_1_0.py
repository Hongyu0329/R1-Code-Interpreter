# --- Evaluation Logic ---

# Step 1 & 2: Evaluate each counseling option.
# The primary goal for adolescents is complete cessation of all nicotine products,
# as the developing brain is highly susceptible to addiction and harm from nicotine.
# Evidence-based pharmacotherapies can be considered for adolescents motivated to quit.

# Option I is incorrect. Encouraging an adolescent to continue vaping is not recommended. The goal is cessation, not harm reduction.
# Option II is correct. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is a valid pharmacotherapy to consider for adolescent nicotine cessation.
# Option III is correct. This is the core message: the long-term risks for adolescents are unknown, so they should not vape.
# Option IV is incorrect. While vaping is less harmful than smoking, describing it as having "clear benefits" for children is misleading and irresponsible.
# Option V is correct. Prescription medications like bupropion and varenicline are also valid pharmacotherapies to consider for adolescent cessation.

# Step 3: Identify the best combination from the answer choices.
# The valid counseling points are II, III, and V. Any answer containing I or IV is incorrect.
# This eliminates: A, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V.
# The remaining options are: B(II), C(III), E(V), J(II, III), N(III, V).
# Note: K, L, M, O, T, V, Q were incorrectly eliminated in thought, re-evaluating:
# K(II,IV), L(II,V), M(III,IV), O(IV,V) are incorrect. Re-checking remaining list is correct.
# B, C, and E are incomplete as they present only one aspect of a good counseling session (either the 'why' or a single 'how').
# L (II, V) is weak because it only lists treatment options without the crucial 'why'.
# The strongest answers combine the rationale (III) with a method for cessation (II or V).
# Both J(II, III) and N(III, V) are strong. J combines the rationale with NRT, which is a very common and logical first step in treatment.
# This makes J an excellent choice for a comprehensive counseling message.
