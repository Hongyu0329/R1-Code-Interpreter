    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a calculation with very high precision. This is because the tangent function is periodic, and its value depends on the argument modulo `π`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Understand the periodicity:** The function `tan(x)` has a period of `π`. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. For our problem, this means `tan(10^100) = tan(10^100 mod π)`.\n2.  **High-Precision Calculation:** The number `10^100` is enormous (a 1 followed by 100 zeros). To find its remainder when divided by `π` accurately, we must use a value of `π` with a precision of more than 100 digits. Standard floating-point numbers in programming languages are not sufficient for this.\n3.  **Use a special library:** We will use the `mpmath` library in Python, which is specifically designed for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic.\n4.  **Execute the calculation:** We'll set the precision in `mpmath` to a safe level (e.g., 115 digits). Then, we will compute the remainder `r = 10^100 mod π`. Finally, we will calculate `tan(r)`.\n5.  **Extract the digits:** From the final result, we will extract the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. You will need to have the `mpmath` library installed. If you don't have it, you can install it by running `pip install mpmath` in your terminal.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef find_tan_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Set the precision for the calculation. The number 10^100 is an integer.\n        # Its division by pi will have about 100 digits before the decimal point.\n        # To find the remainder accurately, we need a precision (dps: decimal places of precision)\n        # well over 100. We'll use 115, which is more than sufficient.\n        mpmath.mp.dps = 115\n\n        # Define the large number x = 10^100 using mpmath's arbitrary-precision float.\n        x = mpmath.mpf(10)**100\n\n        # Get the value of pi with the same high precision.\n        pi = mpmath.pi\n\n        # The value of tan(x) is determined by the remainder of x divided by pi.\n        # We calculate the remainder r = x mod pi. The mpmath.fmod function handles this.\n        remainder = mpmath.fmod(x, pi)\n        \n        # The remainder can be negative depending on the internal fmod implementation.\n        # For a clearer presentation, we can use its positive equivalent in [0, pi),\n        # although tan(r) would be correct either way since tan has period pi.\n        if remainder < 0:\n            remainder += pi\n\n        # Calculate the tangent of the remainder. This value is equal to tan(10^100).\n        result = mpmath.tan(remainder)\n\n        # Output the final equation, showing the numbers involved.\n        # We use mpmath.nstr to format the numbers for better readability.\n        print(\"The calculation follows the identity tan(x) = tan(x mod π):\")\n        print(f\"tan(10^100) = tan(10^100 mod {mpmath.nstr(pi, 6)}...)\")\n        \n        # We display the equation with the calculated values.\n        equation = f\"tan({mpmath.nstr(remainder, 10)})\"\n        print(f\"             = {equation}\")\n        \n        final_result_str = f\"{mpmath.nstr(result, 10)}\"\n        print(f\"             = {final_result_str}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n        # Now, extract the first 3 digits after the decimal point from the final result.\n        result_str = mpmath.nstr(result)\n        decimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n        if decimal_point_index != -1:\n            first_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n            print(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are: {first_three_digits}\")\n        else:\n            # This case is extremely unlikely\n            print(\"The result is an integer, so the first 3 digits after the comma are: 000\")\n\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"This script requires the 'mpmath' library.\")\n        print(\"Please install it using: pip install mpmath\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tan_digits()\n```\n<<<430>>>"
