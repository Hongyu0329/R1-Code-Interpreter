    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that will print the answer to your question.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Store the profession of Andre Vernault in a variable.\n2.  Print a sentence that clearly answers your question using this variable.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reveals the true profession of Andre Vernault during WWII.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Andre Vernault's true profession was concealed from his interrogators.\n    true_profession = \"safe-breaker\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence.\n    print(f\"During World War II, Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from interrogators, which was that of a {true_profession}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_profession()\n```\n<<<safe-breaker>>>"
