    print("A. Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE.")
    print("In the dual formulation of SVM, a key Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is `sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0`, where `alpha_i` are the Lagrange multipliers and `y_i` are the class labels (+1 or -1). Support vectors are the points for which `alpha_i > 0`. If all support vectors belonged to one class, their `y_i` values would all be the same (e.g., +1). This would make the sum `sum(alpha_i)` equal to zero, which is impossible since `alpha_i > 0`. Therefore, there must be support vectors from both classes.")

    print("B. With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE.")
    print("Standard SVM uses a single penalty parameter C for all misclassifications. For imbalanced data, one can use a weighted SVM (or cost-sensitive SVM) with different penalties, C_positive and C_negative. Penalizing the misclassification of the minority class more heavily shifts the decision boundary, which is equivalent to creating an asymmetric penalty zone. This often leads to a more optimal classifier for imbalanced problems.")

    print("C. Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE.")
    print("This is the main idea behind the 'kernel trick'. For example, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, `K(x, z) = exp(-gamma * ||x-z||^2)`, corresponds to a feature map `phi(x)` into an infinite-dimensional space. However, we never need to compute `phi(x)` explicitly. We only need the dot product in that high-dimensional space, which the kernel gives us directly and efficiently, making the problem computationally tractable.")

    print("D. It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE.")
    print("The SVM decision boundary is defined only by the support vectors (the points that lie on or inside the margin hyperplanes). Points that are correctly classified and are far from the boundary (interior points) have corresponding Lagrange multipliers (`alpha_i`) equal to zero. They do not contribute to the sum that defines the weight vector `w` or the bias `b`. Therefore, moving them or adding new ones (as long as they remain interior points) does not change the solution.")

    print("E. Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("Analysis: This is FALSE.")
    print("This is a general mathematical statement that is not universally true. A strictly convex function is only guaranteed to have a unique global minimizer if additional conditions are met (e.g., the domain is compact or the function is coercive). A simple counterexample is the function f(x) = e^x, defined for all real numbers. Its second derivative is e^x > 0, so it is strictly convex. However, it has no global minimum. Its value approaches an infimum of 0 as x approaches -infinity, but it never reaches 0.")
