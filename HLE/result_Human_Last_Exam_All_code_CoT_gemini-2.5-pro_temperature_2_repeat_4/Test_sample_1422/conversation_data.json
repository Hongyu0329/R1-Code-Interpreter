    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use fundamental graph theory relations applied to quantum field theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key equations that govern the structure of Feynman diagrams:\n    *   The topological formula relating the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   The vertex formula relating the interaction type (a `phi^n` interaction has `n` lines at each vertex), vertices (V), internal lines (I), and external lines (E): `n * V = 2 * I + E`.\n\n2.  **State the constraints:** We are given `L = 2`. Our goal is to find the minimum possible integer value for `V`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the problem:** To find the absolute minimum number of vertices, we can consider the simplest class of diagrams: vacuum diagrams. These are diagrams with no external lines, meaning `E = 0`. This simplification often yields the structures with the fewest components.\n\n4.  **Solve the system of equations:** By substituting `L=2` and `E=0` into the formulas, we can derive a single equation that relates `V` and `n`.\n\n5.  **Find the minimum `V`:** We will test this derived equation for the simplest interacting theories (where `n=3, 4, ...`) to find the smallest possible integer `V`. The Python script below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagram_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for an interacting scalar field theory by solving the general relations\n    for diagram topology.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V) for a two-loop (L=2) diagram,\")\n    print(\"we can use the general formula derived for vacuum diagrams (E=0):\")\n    print(\"V = 2 / (n - 2)\")\n    print(\"Here, 'n' is the number of fields in the interaction term (e.g., n=4 for a phi^4 theory).\\n\")\n\n    # For V to be a positive integer, (n-2) must be a positive integer divisor of 2.\n    # The only positive integer divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.\n    possible_n_values = [3, 4]\n    min_vertices = float('inf')\n\n    print(\"We test the formula for the simplest interacting theories (n=3 and n=4):\")\n\n    # Test n=3 (phi^3 theory)\n    n = 3\n    V = 2 / (n - 2)\n    print(f\"\\nFor a phi^{n} theory (n={n}):\")\n    # Output each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"  V = 2 / ({n} - 2)  =>  {int(V)} = 2 / {n-2}\")\n    if int(V) < min_vertices:\n        min_vertices = int(V)\n\n    # Test n=4 (phi^4 theory)\n    n = 4\n    V = 2 / (n - 2)\n    print(f\"\\nFor a phi^{n} theory (n={n}):\")\n    # Output each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"  V = 2 / ({n} - 2)  =>  {int(V)} = 2 / {n-2}\")\n    if int(V) < min_vertices:\n        min_vertices = int(V)\n        \n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The minimum value found is for the n=4 case.\")\n    print(f\"The minimum number of vertices is {min_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a 'figure-eight' vacuum diagram in a phi^4 theory, where two loops are attached to a single vertex.\")\n\n\nsolve_feynman_diagram_vertices()\n<<<1>>>\n```"
