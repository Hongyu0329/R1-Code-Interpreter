    "I will find the largest prime divisor of 8139881 by implementing a prime factorization algorithm.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  Create a list to store the prime factors.\n3.  First, I will handle the factor 2. I'll repeatedly divide `n` by 2 and add 2 to my list of factors until `n` is no longer even.\n4.  Next, I'll iterate through odd numbers (`i`), starting from 3, up to the square root of the remaining `n`.\n5.  For each `i`, if it divides `n`, I will add `i` to the list of factors and update `n` by dividing it by `i`. I'll repeat this until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`.\n6.  After the loop, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 2, this means the remaining `n` is itself a prime factor, so I'll add it to the list.\n7.  Finally, I will construct the factorization equation using the collected factors and then identify and print the largest factor from the list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime divisor of a given number n.\n    It also prints the prime factorization equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle division by 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle division by odd numbers\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the remaining n\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n        i += 2\n\n    # This condition is to handle the case when n is a prime number\n    # greater than 2.
