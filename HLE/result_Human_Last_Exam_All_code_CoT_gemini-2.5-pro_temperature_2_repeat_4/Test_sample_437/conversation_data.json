    "To evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ for a 1s Slater orbital, we need to solve a three-dimensional integral in spherical coordinates. The process involves defining the wavefunction for the 1s Slater orbital, setting up the integral correctly, and then performing the integration.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the 1s Slater Orbital ($\\phi_{1s}$)**: The normalized wavefunction for a 1s Slater-type orbital (STO) is given by $\\phi_{1s}(r) = \\left( \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r}$. Here, $r$ is the radial distance from the nucleus, and $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent, a constant that determines the \"size\" of the orbital. The orbital is spherically symmetric.\n2.  **Set up the Integral**: The bra-ket notation $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$ corresponds to the integral $\\int \\phi_{1s}^* \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\phi_{1s} \\, dV$ over all space. Since the wavefunction is real, $\\phi_{1s}^* = \\phi_{1s}$. The volume element in spherical coordinates is $dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi$.\n3.  **Construct the Full Integrand**: Substituting the wavefunction and volume element, the integral becomes:\n    \\[ I = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right) r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi \\]\n4.  **Evaluate the Integral**: The resulting integral can be solved analytically. We can also use a Python script with a symbolic mathematics library like `sympy` to perform the integration, which confirms the analytical result. The following Python code will define all the components and compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef evaluate_1s_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater-type orbital\n    using the sympy library for symbolic mathematics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols used in the integral\n    # r: radial distance\n    # theta: polar angle\n    # phi: azimuthal angle\n    # zeta: orbital exponent (a positive real number)\n    r, theta, phi = sp.symbols('r theta phi', real=True)\n    zeta = sp.symbols('zeta', positive=True)\n\n    # The problem is to evaluate <phi_i | 1/r | phi_j> for a 1s Slater orbital.\n    # This means phi_i = phi_j = phi_1s.\n    # The normalized 1s Slater orbital is phi_1s = (zeta^3 / pi)^(1/2) * exp(-zeta*r)\n    phi_1s_normalization_constant = sp.sqrt(zeta**3 / sp.pi)\n    phi_1s = phi_1s_normalization_constant * sp.exp(-zeta * r)\n\n    # The operator is 1/r\n    operator = 1 / r\n\n    # The integrand is phi_1s^* * operator * phi_1s * dV\n    # where dV is the volume element in spherical coordinates: r^2 * sin(theta) dr d(theta) d(phi)\n    # Since phi_1s is real, phi_1s^* = phi_1s\n    integrand = phi_1s * operator * phi_1s * r**2 * sp.sin(theta)\n\n    # Simplify the integrand before integration\n    integrand_simplified = sp.simplify(integrand)\n    \n    # Perform the triple integration over all space:\n    # r from 0 to infinity\n    # theta from 0 to pi\n    # phi from 0 to 2*pi\n    integral_value = sp.integrate(\n        integrand_simplified,\n        (r, 0, sp.oo),\n        (theta, 0, sp.pi),\n        (phi, 0, 2*sp.pi)\n    )\n\n    # Output the result\n    # We construct the equation string to be clear about what was calculated.\n    # The components are the orbital phi_1s, the operator 1/r, and the resulting value.\n    phi_i_str = \"phi_1s\"\n    operator_str = \"1/r\"\n    phi_j_str = \"phi_1s\"\n\n    print(f\"Evaluating the integral: <{phi_i_str} | {operator_str} | {phi_j_str}>\")\n    print(f\"Where phi_1s(r) = (zeta^3 / pi)^(1/2) * exp(-zeta*r)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    # In the final equation, we explicitly show each component.\n    print(f\"Final Equation: <{phi_i_str} | {operator_str} | {phi_j_str}> = {integral_value}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    evaluate_1s_slater_integral()\n```\n<<<zeta>>>"
