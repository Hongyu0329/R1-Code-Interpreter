    "My plan is to provide the answer by creating a Python script. The script will contain the detailed explanation as a string variable. This explanation will first state the source of the evaluation, which is Liu Ban's (刘攽) work \"Zhongshan Poetry Talks\" (《中山诗话》). Then, it will present the original quote containing the exact evaluation. Finally, it will explain the meaning of this classical Chinese quote in modern terms. The script will then print this entire explanation for the user.\n\n```python\ndef get_evaluation_of_zhang_ji():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides Liu Ban's evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems.\n    \"\"\"\n    evaluation_text = \"\"\"北宋学者刘攽在其诗话著作《中山诗话》中对唐代诗人张籍的诗歌进行了评价。\n\n刘攽认为张籍的乐府诗成就最高，而对于其七言诗，他的确切评价是：\n\n“张籍七言，亦其乐府之亚也。”\n\n这句话的含义是：张籍的七言诗，是仅次于他乐府诗的作品。换言之，刘攽觉得张籍的七言诗写得不错，但艺术成就和重要性要比他最出色的乐府诗低一个等级。\"\"\"\n    print(evaluation_text)\n\nget_evaluation_of_zhang_ji()\n```\n<<<北宋学者刘攽在其《中山诗话》中的确切评价是：“张籍七言，亦其乐府之亚也。” 其意为张籍的七言诗虽好，但成就不及他最擅长的乐府诗。>>>"
