    "Yes, if a Schwartz class function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has all its moments equal to zero, i.e., $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then it must be the zero function, $f=0$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning behind this conclusion, which uses properties of the Fourier transform.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1.  **Fourier Transform:** Let's consider the Fourier transform of the function $f(x)$, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\n    A key property of Schwartz functions is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function. This means $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is infinitely differentiable and decays rapidly.\n\n2.  **Derivatives of the Fourier Transform:** We can compute the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ by differentiating under the integral sign:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\n\n3.  **Connecting to Moments:** Now, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin ($\\xi=0$):\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k \\, dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\n    This equation shows a direct relationship between the derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin and the moments of the original function $f(x)$.\n\n4.  **Using the Given Condition:** We are given that all moments are zero, i.e., $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. Substituting this into the equation above gives:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n    This means that the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ and all of its derivatives are zero at $\\xi = 0$.\n\n5.  **Analyticity and Taylor Series:** A Schwartz function is smooth, and its Fourier transform is an analytic function. An analytic function is one that is locally equal to its Taylor series. The Taylor series expansion of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi=0$ is:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k $$\n    Since we found that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$, all the coefficients of the Taylor series are zero. This implies that the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is identically zero for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n6.  **Uniqueness of the Fourier Transform:** The Fourier transform is an invertible operation on the space of Schwartz functions. By the Fourier inversion theorem, we can recover $f(x)$ from $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$:\n    $$ f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi $$\n    Since we've established that $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$, the integral is zero, which means $f(x)=0$ for all $x$.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\nTo demonstrate this with code, we can't prove it for all functions. However, we can illustrate the contrapositive: if a Schwartz function is *not* the zero function, then at least one of its moments must be non-zero. Let's take the non-zero Schwartz function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ and calculate its first few moments numerically.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\nfrom scipy.special import gamma\n\ndef schwartz_function_illustration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the moments of a non-zero Schwartz function, f(x) = exp(-x^2),\n    to demonstrate that its moments are not all zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define a non-zero Schwartz function, the Gaussian function.\n    f = lambda x: np.exp(-x**2)\n\n    print(\"Illustrating the contrapositive: a non-zero Schwartz function f(x) = exp(-x^2) has non-zero moments.\")\n    print(\"A moment is defined by the equation: M_k = integral from -inf to inf of x^k * f(x) dx.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Calculate moments for k from 0 to 10\n    for k in range(11):\n        # Define the function to integrate for the k-th moment\n        integrand = lambda x: (x**k) * f(x)\n\n        # Perform numerical integration from -infinity to +infinity\n        moment_val, error = quad(integrand, -np.inf, np.inf)\n\n        # For f(x) = exp(-x^2), moments for odd k are 0, and for even k=2n are Gamma(n + 1/2).\n        if k % 2 == 1:\n            analytical_val = 0.0\n        else:\n            n = k / 2.0\n            analytical_val = gamma(n + 0.5)\n\n        # Print the final equation with the calculated numbers\n        # This shows the equation form: Integral = result\n        print(f\"For k={k}:\")\n        print(f\"  The equation is: integral(x^{k} * exp(-x^2)) dx = {moment_val:.8f}\")\n        print(f\"  The known analytical value is: {analytical_val:.8f}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"As the output shows, the moments for even values of k are non-zero.\")\n    print(\"This is consistent with the theorem: since the function is not identically zero, its moments are not all zero.\")\n\nschwartz_function_illustration()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
