    """
    Explains the structural difference between Type-2 and Type-3 fuzzy membership functions
    and determines the best answer from the provided choices.
    """

    explanation = """
Plan:
1. Define the dimensional structure of a Type-1 Fuzzy Set as a baseline.
2. Explain the structural change from Type-1 to Type-2, noting the introduction of a secondary membership function.
3. Explain the subsequent structural change from Type-2 to Type-3.
4. Compare this change to the provided answer choices to find the most accurate description.

Execution:
A Type-1 fuzzy set's membership function maps an input variable to a crisp membership degree (a number between 0 and 1). This is a two-dimensional relationship (variable vs. degree).

A Type-2 fuzzy set introduces uncertainty about the membership degree itself. The membership is no longer a crisp number but a fuzzy set, often represented as an interval. This creates a 3D structure that involves a primary variable, a primary membership degree, and a secondary membership function that assigns a value to each point within this uncertainty.

A Type-3 fuzzy set adds yet another layer of uncertainty. It addresses uncertainty about the secondary membership grade from the Type-2 set. To model this, a new function is required. Therefore, the fundamental structural difference when moving from a Type-2 to a Type-3 fuzzy set is the introduction of a **tertiary membership function**.

Analysis of Options:
- A, D, J describe the purpose or outcome (vagueness, complexity, refinement), not the structural difference.
- E ('Three-dimensional uncertainty modeling added') describes the transition from Type-1 to Type-2.
- F ('Tertiary membership functions introduced') perfectly captures the new structural element added to a Type-2 set to make it a Type-3 set. This is the most precise and fundamental difference.
- B, C, G, H, I are either less precise or incorrect descriptions of the core structural change.

Conclusion:
The defining structural difference is the new function that models the highest layer of uncertainty.
