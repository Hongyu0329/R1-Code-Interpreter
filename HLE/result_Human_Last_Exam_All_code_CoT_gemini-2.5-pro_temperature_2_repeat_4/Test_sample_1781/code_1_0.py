    Analyzes the historical question to determine the correct year and person.

    # Step 1: Identify the historical context.
    # The question refers to the shift in the French royal title from "Rex Francorum" (King of the Franks)
    # to "Rex Franciae" (King of France). This important change reflects a move from a monarchy
    # based on personal allegiance to one based on territorial sovereignty.
    # This transformation was initiated during the reign of Philip II (1180-1223).
    # Official documents from his chancellery began using the title "King of France" starting around the year 1190.

    # Step 2: Identify the source of the epithet.
    # King Philip II was given the epithet "Augustus" (Auguste in French) by his contemporary
    # chronicler and biographer, Rigord of Saint-Denis. In his "Gesta Philippi Augusti"
    # ("The Deeds of Philip Augustus"), Rigord explains that he gave Philip this title in reference
    # to the Roman emperor Augustus, because Philip was born in the month of August and had
    # significantly "augmented" the French royal domain.

    # Step 3: Evaluate the options.
    # We are looking for a pair that correctly links the year and the biographer.
    # - Key Monarch: Philip II Augustus
    # - Key Year for title change: 1190
    # - Key Biographer for epithet: Rigord
    #
    # Let's review the choices:
    # A. 1190, Suetonius: Correct year, but Suetonius was a Roman historian from the 2nd century. Incorrect.
    # B. 1250, Joinville: Incorrect. Joinville was the biographer of King Louis IX (Saint Louis).
    # C. 1223, Rigord: Rigord is the correct biographer. The year 1223 is the year of Philip II's death, not the start of the title change. However, it falls within the correct era, and this option has the correct, specific biographer.
    # D. 1789, Voltaire: Incorrect. This is the year of the French Revolution, and Voltaire was an 18th-century philosopher.
    # E. 1190, Baldwin: Correct year, but Baldwin is not the correct biographer credited with the epithet.

    # Conclusion: Choice C is the best fit. Although the year 1190 marked the beginning of the title change, option C is the only one that correctly identifies Rigord as the crucial biographer who provided the monarch's epithet. The pairing of the correct historian with a significant year from the monarch's reign (his death) makes it the strongest answer.
