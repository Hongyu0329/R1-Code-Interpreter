# Step 1: Define the number of replicas as specified in the problem.
n = 2

# Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the larger group, G = Sp(2n, R).
# The formula for the dimension of Sp(2n, R) is n * (2n + 1).
dim_G = n * (2 * n + 1)

# Step 3: Calculate the dimension of the subgroup, K = U(n).
# The formula for the dimension of U(n) is n^2.
dim_K = n * n

# Step 4: The number of variables is the dimension of the quotient space G/K,
# which is calculated by subtracting the dimension of K from the dimension of G.
num_variables = dim_G - dim_K

# Step 5: Print the explanation and the final result.
