    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the structure of the given SKI expression to understand how it's composed.\n2.  I will identify key sub-expressions and determine their function in the context of Church numerals. The most prominent are `S(I)`, `S(S(K(S))(K))` (the successor combinator, `succ`), and `S(I)(I)` (the self-application combinator, `M`).\n3.  The problem states the expression is a Church numeral, `n`. Church numerals are functions of the form `λf.λx. f^n x`. My goal is to find the integer `n`.\n4.  I will deduce the mathematical operations that correspond to the actions of the combinator sub-expressions on Church numerals. For example, I will figure out how a complex combinator like `succ(M)` transforms a Church numeral `C_k`.\n5.  By applying these operations from the inside out according to the expression's nested structure, I will calculate the final integer value `n`.\n6.  Finally, I will use Python's `math` library to compute `log_2(n)` as requested and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by logically reducing the SKI combinator expression\n    step-by-step to find the Church numeral 'n' it represents, and then computes log_2(n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis of Combinator Operations on Church Numerals (C_k denotes Church k):\n    #\n    # 1. Let's define `op = S(I)`. The reduction rule for `op(x)(y)` is `(S I x) y = I y (x y) = y(x y)`.\n    #    When `op` is applied to a Church numeral `C_k`, we get a new function `op(C_k)`.\n    #    When this function `op(C_k)` is applied to a function `f` and value `x`, we get:\n    #    (op(C_k) f) x = f (C_k f x) = f (f^k x) = f^(k+1) x.\n    #    This means that `op(C_k)` is equivalent to the Church numeral `C_{k+1}`.\n    #\n    # 2. The expression `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` represents `succ(I)`, which is the Church numeral for 2 (`C_2`).\n    #\n    # 3. The expression `succ_M = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` represents `succ(M)`. `M` is the self-application\n    #    combinator (`S(I)(I)`). Let's see how `succ_M` acts on a Church numeral `C_k`.\n    #    `succ_M(C_k)` evaluates to `succ(M(C_k))`.\n    #    For Church numerals, self-application `M(C_k) = C_k(C_k)` corresponds to exponentiation `C_{k^k}`.\n    #    Wait, `C_m(C_n)` is multiplication, `C_{m*n}`, not exponentiation. So `C_k(C_k) = C_{k*k} = C_{k^2}`.\n    #    Therefore, `succ_M(C_k)` becomes `succ(C_{k^2})`, which is `C_{k^2 + 1}`.\n    #\n\n    # The expression can be interpreted based on its parenthesis structure as:\n    # S(I) ( S(I) ( S(I)(K(C_2)) ) ( succ_M ) )\n    # Let's evaluate this from the inside out.\n\n    # 1. The innermost functional part is `op(K(C_2))`. This becomes a new function, let's call it B.\n    #    `B = op(K(C_2)) = λy. y(K(C_2) y) = λy. y(C_2)`.\n\n    # 2. This function B is then used in the next level: `op(B, succ_M)`.\n    #    This expression reduces to `succ_M(B(succ_M))`.\n    #    Applying B, we get `B(succ_M) = (λy. y(C_2))(succ_M) = succ_M(C_2)`.\n    #    Using our `succ_M` rule on `C_2` (where k=2), we get `C_{2^2 + 1}`, which is `C_5`.\n    #    So, `B(succ_M)` evaluates to `C_5`.\n    #    Now we have `succ_M(C_5)`. We apply the rule again (where k=5) to get `C_{5^2 + 1} = C_{26}`.\n\n    # 3. The final outermost operation is `op` applied to the result from the previous step, `C_{26}`.\n    #    So we have `op(C_{26})`.\n    #    Using our `op` rule, this evaluates to `C_{26+1}`, which is `C_{27}`.\n\n    # The Church numeral `n` represented by the full expression is 27.\n    n = 27\n\n    # The question asks for log_2(n).\n    log2_n = math.log2(n)\n    \n    # As requested, outputting each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"log_2({n}) = {log2_n}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<4.754887502163469>>>"
