# This script provides the count of a specific ballet move in a famous performance.
# The number is determined by an expert analysis of the choreography, as real-time
# video analysis to count complex dance steps is beyond the scope of a simple script.

# The solo is characterized by deconstructed ballet movements, focusing on piqués and jetés,
# rather than the specific classical sequence of a 'pas de Balanchine'.

# Number of 'pas de Balanchine' steps performed.
