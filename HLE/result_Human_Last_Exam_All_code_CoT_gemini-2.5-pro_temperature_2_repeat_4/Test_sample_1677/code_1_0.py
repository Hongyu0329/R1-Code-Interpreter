    Analyzes explanations for the increase in Japanese university entrants and identifies incorrect ones.

    The task is to identify the incorrect or inappropriate explanations from the given list.
    Based on factual analysis of Japan's demographics and education system:

    A. The decrease in the 18-year-old population was smaller than predicted:
       This is factually incorrect. Japan's 18-year-old population declined sharply and predictably.
       The number of 18-year-olds was approx. 2.05 million in 1992 and fell to approx. 1.06 million by 2023.
       This is a steep decline, not a moderate one. The predictions from the 1990s were largely accurate about the demographic drop.

    B. Increase in university enrollment rate:
       This is a correct explanation. The university advancement rate (大学進学率) has risen significantly, from under 30% in the early 1990s to over 57% in 2023. This is the primary reason why the number of entrants has increased despite a smaller youth cohort.

    C. Increased demand for re-learning by working adults:
       This is a correct contributing factor. Lifelong learning and reskilling are growing trends, and universities are increasingly offering programs for working adults, adding to the total student population.

    D. Diversification of higher education:
       This explanation is inappropriate. It misrepresents the role of other institutions.
       Two-year colleges (短期大学) have been declining, not growing, as students increasingly prefer four-year universities directly.
       While some students transfer from these colleges, they are not increasingly working as "prep schools" in a way that would be a major driver of the total entrant numbers for four-year universities. The primary trend is a direct shift to four-year universities.

    E. Government policies:
       This is a correct explanation. The government eased university establishment standards in the 1990s, which led to a significant increase in the number of private universities, thereby increasing the number of available places for students.

    The incorrect or inappropriate options are A and D.
    We will print them in alphabetical order, separated by a comma.

    incorrect_options = ["A", "D"]
    
    # Sort the options alphabetically as requested
    incorrect_options.sort()
    
    # Join the sorted options with a comma for the final output
    final_answer = ",".join(incorrect_options)
