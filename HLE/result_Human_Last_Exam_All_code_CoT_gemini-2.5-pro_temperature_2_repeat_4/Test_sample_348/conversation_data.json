    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve for the total welfare:\n\n1.  **Define the Market Equilibrium:** First, we need to find the point where the market is in equilibrium. This occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q_e) and the price is the same for both functions. We can find this by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q_e³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_e))`\n    This equation is complex and cannot be solved algebraically, so we will use a numerical solver in Python to find the equilibrium quantity, `Q_e`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Equilibrium Price (P_e):** Once we have `Q_e`, we can substitute it back into either the supply or the demand function to find the corresponding equilibrium price, `P_e`.\n\n3.  **Understand Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It represents the total benefit to society from the production and consumption of a good. Geometrically, it is the area between the demand curve and the supply curve, up to the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`.\n\n4.  **Set up the Integral for Total Welfare:** The total welfare can be calculated by the following definite integral:\n    `Total Welfare = ∫ (Demand_Price(Q) - Supply_Price(Q)) dQ`\n    The upper limit of integration is the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`. The lower limit is the minimum quantity at which the supply function is defined. For our supply function `P = ln(Q³ - 2)`, the term inside the logarithm must be positive (`Q³ - 2 > 0`), which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. So, our lower limit is `2^(1/3)`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will use Python's scientific computing libraries (`scipy` and `numpy`) to:\n    *   Find the root `Q_e` of the equilibrium equation.\n    *   Numerically integrate the difference between the demand and supply functions from `2^(1/3)` to `Q_e` to find the total welfare.\n    *   Print out the equilibrium values and the final calculation for total welfare.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the demand and supply price functions\ndef demand_price(Q):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the price on the demand curve for a given quantity Q.\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q))\n\ndef supply_price(Q):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the price on the supply curve for a given quantity Q.\"\"\"\n    # The argument of log must be positive. Handle potential domain errors.\n    # We add a very small number to avoid log(0) issues with numerical methods.\n    arg = Q**3 - 2\n    return np.log(np.maximum(arg, 1e-12))\n\n# Define the function to find the equilibrium point\n# Equilibrium occurs where Demand Price = Supply Price, so their difference is 0.\ndef equilibrium_equation(Q):\n    \"\"\"Returns the difference between supply and demand prices. The root is the equilibrium quantity.\"\"\"\n    # The supply function is only defined for Q > 2^(1/3).\n    # Return a large value if Q is outside the domain to guide the solver.\n    if Q**3 <= 2:\n        return 1e6  # A large penalty for being out of the domain\n    return supply_price(Q) - demand_price(Q)\n\n# --- Step 1 & 2: Find Equilibrium Quantity and Price ---\n\n# Provide an initial guess for Q. Since supply starts at 2^(1/3) ~= 1.26, let's guess 2.\ninitial_guess_Q = 2.0\n# Use fsolve to find the root of the equilibrium_equation\nQ_e = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess_Q)[0]\n# Calculate the equilibrium price by plugging Q_e into the demand function\nP_e = demand_price(Q_e)\n\nprint(f\"Market Equilibrium:\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Quantity (Q_e): {Q_e:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Price (P_e): {P_e:.4f}\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Step 3, 4, & 5: Calculate Total Welfare ---\n\n# The integrand is the difference between the demand and supply curves\ndef integrand_welfare(Q):\n    return demand_price(Q) - supply_price(Q)\n\n# The lower limit for the supply curve is where Q^3 - 2 > 0 => Q > 2^(1/3)\nlower_bound = (2)**(1/3)\n\n# Use quad to perform the numerical integration for total welfare\ntotal_welfare, integration_error = quad(integrand_welfare, lower_bound, Q_e)\n\nprint(\"Calculating Total Welfare:\")\nprint(\"Total Welfare = ∫(Demand(Q) - Supply(Q)) dQ\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = ∫ from Q={lower_bound:.4f} to Q={Q_e:.4f} of [ (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) - (ln(Q³ - 2)) ] dQ\")\nprint(f\"Result of the integration: {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\n# Final Answer\n# print(f\"<<<{total_welfare:.4f}>>>\")\n<<<9.8095>>>\n```"
