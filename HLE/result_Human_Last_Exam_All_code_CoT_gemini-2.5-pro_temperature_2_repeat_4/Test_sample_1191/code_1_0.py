# The user wants to understand the evolutionary force responsible for maintaining a constant genomic mutation rate.
# I will analyze the provided options based on principles of evolutionary biology.

# A. Natural selection for fitness optimality: This is a plausible mechanism. If the mutation rate is too high, it creates a high load of deleterious mutations, reducing fitness. If it's too low, it may limit adaptability. Natural selection could thus favor an optimal, intermediate mutation rate.

# B. Genetic drift in small populations: Drift is a random process and would cause the mutation rate to fluctuate, not stabilize.

# C. Equilibrium between beneficial and deleterious mutations: This is a consequence of the mutation rate (mutation-selection balance), not the cause of its stability.

# D. Homogeneous mutation distribution: This describes the spatial pattern of mutations, not the temporal rate.

# E. The stochastic nature of mutational events: This explains the randomness of individual mutations, not the stability of the average rate over time.

# Based on this analysis, natural selection is the key force that maintains the mutation rate. A mutation rate that is too high is selected against because of the accumulation of harmful mutations.

# Let's print the best choice and a brief explanation.
explanation = "Natural selection for fitness optimality is the primary factor. A mutation rate that is too high is selected against because it creates an unsustainable load of deleterious mutations, reducing overall fitness. This selective pressure maintains the mutation rate at a relatively stable, optimal level for the organism."
