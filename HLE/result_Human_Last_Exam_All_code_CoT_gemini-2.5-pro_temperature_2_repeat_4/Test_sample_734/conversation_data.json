    "My plan to answer this question involves the following steps:\n1.  Analyze the key requirements of the question: The user is looking for a specific Christian theologian, a historical figure, who was the *first* to create a specialized vocabulary or conceptual framework.\n2.  This framework must be able to explain \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n3.  The framework must be applicable to two specific events: the miracle of the virgin birth of Jesus and the systemic alteration of nature that is said to have occurred at the Fall of Man.\n4.  I will search through prominent theologians known for their work on creation, providence, and miracles, such as Irenaeus, Origen, Augustine, Aquinas, and later reformers.\n5.  I will evaluate them based on who fits the criteria best. Augustine of Hippo stands out. He developed concepts like the *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons) and made a crucial distinction between what is \"contrary to nature\" (which he argued nothing is, as God is the author of nature) and what is \"contrary to the *usual course* of nature.\" This terminology allows for unique miraculous events (like the virgin birth) and a foundational shift in how nature operates (the consequences of the Fall) without making God's actions seem chaotic or self-contradictory. He is widely considered the foundational Western thinker on this specific topic.\n6.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print the name of this theologian as requested in the instructions.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Christian theologian who developed specialized terminology\n    for changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The theologian identified through historical and theological analysis is Augustine of Hippo.\n    # He distinguished between the \"usual course of nature\" and God's direct action,\n    # providing a framework for understanding miracles and systemic changes.\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    \n    print(f\"The theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to events like the virgin birth and the Fall, was:\")\n    print(theologian)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
