    "This is a question about art history. My plan is to first use my knowledge base to identify the specific object held by Curt Querner in his 1933 self-portrait and understand its symbolism. Then, I will create a Python script that will print this information in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event = \"escaping from Gestapo\"\n    held_object = \"a trowel\"\n    symbolism = \"a symbol of his identity as a worker and his resistance against the regime\"\n\n    print(f\"In {year}, after {event}, the artist {artist} painted a self-portrait.\")\n    print(f\"In his hand, he holds {held_object}, which serves as {symbolism}.\")\n\nfind_symbol()\n```\n<<<a trowel>>>"
