    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of two quantities for an electron in the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$):\n1.  The **uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$)**.\n2.  Its **classical momentum ($p$)**.\n\nWe are given the uncertainty in the electron's position, $\\Delta x = 10$ pm.\n\nTo solve this, we will need to use two key concepts:\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle** to find the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) from the given uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$).\n*   **The Bohr Model of the atom** to find the momentum ($p$) of an electron in the first orbit.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Constants:** We will need the values of fundamental physical constants, specifically Planck's constant ($h$) and the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n2.  **Units:** The given uncertainty in position is in picometers (pm). It must be converted to the standard SI unit, meters (m), to be consistent with the other constants. ($1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$).\n3.  **Formulas:** We must use the correct formulas for the Uncertainty Principle and for the momentum of an electron in a Bohr orbit.\n4.  **Approximation:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives a lower bound ($\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$). For calculation purposes, we use the minimum uncertainty, which means we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty is given by:\n$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the uncertainty in momentum, $\\Delta p$:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}$\n\n*   Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n*   Given uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\nSo, the expression for $\\Delta p$ is:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi (10^{-11})}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Momentum ($p$) in the First Bohr Orbit**\n\nAccording to the Bohr model, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron is quantized:\n$L = m_e v r = n \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n*   $v$ is its velocity.\n*   $r$ is the orbital radius.\n*   $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nThe linear momentum is $p = m_e v$. Substituting this into the angular momentum equation gives:\n$p \\cdot r = n \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$\n\nWe can solve for momentum $p$:\n$p = \\frac{nh}{2\\pi r}$\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, and the radius $r$ is the Bohr radius, $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\nSo, the momentum is:\n$p = \\frac{(1)h}{2\\pi r_1} = \\frac{h}{2\\pi (5.29 \\times 10^{-11})}$\n\n**Step 3: Find the Ratio of Uncertainty in Momentum to Momentum ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$)**\n\nNow we form the ratio using the expressions from Step 1 and Step 2:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{h}{2\\pi r_1} \\right)}$\n\nWe can simplify this algebraic expression by multiplying by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x} \\times \\frac{2\\pi r_1}{h}$\n\nThe Planck's constant $h$ and the term $2\\pi$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\nThis simplified formula makes the final calculation straightforward. Now, we plug in the values:\n*   Radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n\nThe $10^{-11}$ terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity, so there are no units.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
