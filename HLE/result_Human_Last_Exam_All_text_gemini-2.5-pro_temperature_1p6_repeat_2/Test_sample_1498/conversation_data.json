    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that mention the names of the prophets.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the specific range of verses (*abyāt* or *bayts*) in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam, that list the names of the 25 prophets whose mention is considered necessary knowledge in Islam.\n\n2.  **Context of the Poem:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is a didactic poem that summarizes the essential tenets of Islamic creed (aqidah) according to the Ash'ari school. One of these tenets is the belief in all the prophets, specifically the 25 whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an. The poem systematically lists these names for easy memorization.\n\n3.  **Locating the Relevant Section:** The poem is structured logically. It begins with praises to Allah, then discusses His attributes. Following this, it discusses the Messengers (prophets), their necessary attributes (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence), and then proceeds to list their names.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Preceding Verse (A Careful Point):** Before the list begins, there is a verse that acts as an introduction to the list. This is **Bayt 27**. It states the obligation of knowing the 25 prophets.\n    *   **Bayt 27:**\n        تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n        كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"The detailed list of twenty-five is necessary for every legally responsible person, so verify and seize this opportunity.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse is crucial as it sets the stage, but it does not yet mention any names. The listing starts *after* this verse.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Starting Verse of the List:** The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the very next verse.\n    *   **Bayt 28:**\n        هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n        صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse contains the first six names on the list. This marks the beginning of the range we are looking for.\n\n6.  **Continuing Through the List:** The poem continues to list the names in the subsequent verses.\n    *   **Bayt 29:**\n        لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقٌ كَذَا\n        يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n    *   **Translation:** \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq likewise, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed.\"\n    *   **Bayt 30:**\n        شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\n        ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** These two verses continue the enumeration without interruption.\n\n7.  **Identifying the Final Verse of the List:** The list of names concludes in the next verse, which mentions the final prophets, ending with the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who is referred to by the name 'Taha'.\n    *   **Bayt 31:**\n        إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n        عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   **Translation:** \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa and Taha (Prophet Muhammad), the seal, so abandon misguidance.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse contains the final names, making it the end of the range.\n\n8.  **Identifying the Following Verse (A Careful Point):** The verse immediately after the list, **Bayt 32**, gives salutations upon the prophets and does not list any new names.\n    *   **Bayt 32:**\n        عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ\n        وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Upon them be peace and blessings, and upon their families, as long as the days last.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse serves as a conclusion to the section on the prophets, confirming that the list ended in the previous verse.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the poem's text and structure, the names of the prophets are explicitly mentioned starting from **Bayt 28** and concluding in **Bayt 31**.\n\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 31.>>>"
