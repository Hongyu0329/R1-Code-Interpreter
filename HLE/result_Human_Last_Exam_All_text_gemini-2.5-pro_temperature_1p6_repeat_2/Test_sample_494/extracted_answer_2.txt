Yes, the exotic ammonia molecule would exhibit tunneling. The potential barrier for inversion is determined by the electronic structure and nuclear masses, which are unchanged. The nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms affects the overall symmetry requirements for the total molecular wavefunction. For exotic hydrogens with spin 0 (bosons), the total wavefunction must be symmetric under particle exchange. Both the symmetric and anti-symmetric vibrational states produced by tunneling can be combined with appropriate rotational states to satisfy this overall symmetry requirement. Since both states are physically allowed, the energy splitting between them—the hallmark of tunneling—will exist.
