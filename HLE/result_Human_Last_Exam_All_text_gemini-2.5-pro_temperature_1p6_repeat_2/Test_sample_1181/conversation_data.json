    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is a very specific emotional state: the character is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\"\n\n**Step 2: Recall the context and major themes of the film.**\nTarkovsky's *Solaris* is a deeply philosophical and melancholic film. It contrasts the cold, sterile environment of a space station with the vibrant, living nature of Earth. Key themes include memory, conscience, the nature of humanity, and the inability of science to grasp the totality of existence. The film famously begins with a long, meditative sequence on Earth, establishing the natural world (specifically water, plants, and their sounds) as a powerful symbol of home and life.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each character option in relation to the question.**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** He is the main protagonist, a psychologist sent from Earth to the Solaris station. The film's entire perspective is centered on him. The opening scenes on Earth are his farewell. He is the one leaving the world of rustling leaves behind. Throughout the film, he grapples with his memories, his past, and his own emotional numbness. The quote in question reflects a deep, personal moment of introspection about his disconnect from the very things that define his home and his humanity. In a key conversation with Snaut on the station, Kris reflects on his memories and expresses this exact sentiment, realizing with shame that he has forgotten how to feel such simple longings.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's deceased wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's own memories. She has never been on Earth herself. Therefore, she cannot *miss* something she has never experienced. Her entire existence is confined to the station and Kris's memories of her. This choice is logically incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Snaut:** He is one of the scientists already on the station when Kris arrives. He is world-weary, cynical, and has been in space for a long time. While he certainly misses Earth and speaks philosophically about humanity's longing to \"extend the Earth to the borders of the cosmos,\" the specific, shame-filled, and poetic reflection about rustling leaves is not attributed to him. He acts more as a sounding board for Kris's emotional journey.\n\n*   **D. Sartorius:** He is the other surviving scientist. He is depicted as cold, clinical, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their mission. He actively suppresses emotion and views the \"visitors\" as mere scientific phenomena to be studied or destroyed. It would be entirely out of character for the pragmatic and emotionally detached Sartorius to voice such a sentimental and self-aware feeling of shame.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** He is the scientist who has committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris watches a final video message from him. In this message, Gibarian is distraught and panicked, warning Kris about the station and the nature of the \"visitors.\" His concerns are immediate and ethical (\"This is about conscience\"), not a nostalgic or poetic reflection on missing Earth's natural sounds.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nThe sentiment of being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling\" is a very specific and poignant line of dialogue. It is spoken by the main character, Kris Kelvin, as he comes to terms with his emotional state and his disconnection from his past and his home world. The line perfectly encapsulates his character arc and the film's central themes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
