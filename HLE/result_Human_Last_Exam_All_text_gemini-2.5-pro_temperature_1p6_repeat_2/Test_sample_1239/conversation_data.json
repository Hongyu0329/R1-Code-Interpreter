    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations\n\nThe equations for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are given by:\n1.  Momentum Equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  Incompressibility Condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\nHere, $\\nu > 0$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We seek the dimension of the Lie group of continuous point transformations of variables $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$ that leave this system of equations invariant. The dimension of the group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is the vector space of the infinitesimal generators of these symmetry transformations.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Basic Symmetries (Euclidean Symmetries)\n\nBased on the physical context of the equations (homogeneity and isotropy of space, and autonomy in time), we can identify several immediate symmetries:\n*   **Time translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. This gives a symmetry transformation $t' = t + s$.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$ (1 generator).\n*   **Space translations:** The equations are invariant under translations in space, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$.\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$ (3 generators).\n*   **Spatial rotations:** The equations are isotropic, meaning they are invariant under rotations $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$ for $R \\in SO(3)$.\n    *   Generators: $J_i = \\epsilon_{ijk} (x_j \\partial_{x_k} + u_j \\partial_{u_k})$ for $i=1,2,3$ (3 generators).\n\nSo far, we have identified $1 + 3 + 3 = 7$ generators. These form the Lie algebra of the Euclidean group of motions in spacetime.\n\n### Step 3: Checking for Scaling Symmetries\n\nLet's test for a scaling symmetry of the form:\n$t' = \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p' = \\lambda^d p$.\n\nSubstituting these into the momentum equation and requiring invariance for any $\\lambda$ leads to a system of linear equations for the exponents $a, b, c, d$.\n*   $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$ scales by $\\lambda^{c-a}$.\n*   $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}$ scales by $\\lambda^{2c-b}$.\n*   $\\nabla p$ scales by $\\lambda^{d-b}$.\n*   $\\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$ scales by $\\lambda^{c-2b}$.\n\nEquating the exponents gives: $c-a = 2c-b = d-b = c-2b$.\nFrom the incompressibility condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}=0$, we find that $\\nabla' \\cdot \\mathbf{u}'$ must be zero. This term scales by $\\lambda^{c-b}$, so this expression must hold, but it does not impose a new constraint on the exponents.\n\nFrom $2c-b = c-2b$, we get $c = -b$.\nSubstituting this into the other equalities:\n$-b-a = -2b-b = d-b = -b-2b$\n$-b-a = -3b \\implies a = 2b$.\n$d-b = -3b \\implies d = -2b$.\n\nWe can choose $b=1$ without loss of generality (as $\\lambda$ is the parameter). This gives the exponents: $a=2, b=1, c=-1, d=-2$.\nThis corresponds to a valid one-parameter scaling group:\n$t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$.\nThe infinitesimal generator for this group is:\n*   $D = 2t \\partial_t + x_i \\partial_{x_i} - u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2p \\partial_p$ (1 generator).\n\nThis brings the total count to $7+1 = 8$ generators.\n\n### Step 4: Galilean Symmetries and Pressure Symmetries\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts:** Unlike the Euler equations (where $\\nu=0$), the Navier-Stokes equations are *not* invariant under the standard Galilean transformations. The viscous term $\\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$ does not have the same transformation property as the other terms under a boost. Thus, Galilean boosts are not symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n*   **Pressure Symmetries:** The pressure $p$ only appears in the equation as a gradient, $\\nabla p$. This means we can add any function to $p$ whose gradient is zero, without changing the equation. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the gradient is zero only for functions that do not depend on the spatial variables $\\mathbf{x}$. So, the transformation $p' = p + g(t)$ for any arbitrary function $g(t)$ is a symmetry.\n    *   This implies an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries, with generators $g(t)\\partial_p$.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Dimension (Finite vs. Infinite)\n\nThe presence of the $p \\to p+g(t)$ symmetry means the full Lie group of point symmetries is infinite-dimensional. However, such questions usually seek the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra* of symmetries. This is a standard convention when dealing with equations having \"gauge-like\" symmetries.\n\nWe need to find the largest finite-dimensional subalgebra within the full (infinite) symmetry algebra. The full algebra is spanned by the 8 generators found so far, plus the infinite set $\\{g(t)\\partial_p\\}$. The key is to see how the finite-dimensional part (spanned by the 8 generators) interacts with the infinite-dimensional part via the Lie bracket.\n\nAll generators commute with $g(t)\\partial_p$ except the scaling generator $D$. The commutator is:\n$[D, g(t)\\partial_p] = [2t \\partial_t + x_i \\partial_{x_i} - u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2p \\partial_p, g(t)\\partial_p] = (2tg'(t) + 2g(t))\\partial_p$.\n\nFor a subalgebra to be finite-dimensional, it must be closed under this commutation. This means the space of functions $g(t)$ we include must form a finite-dimensional vector space that is invariant under the linear operator $L(g) = 2tg' + 2g$.\n\nLet's test this operator on simple functions. If $g(t)=t^k$, $L(t^k) = 2t(kt^{k-1}) + 2t^k = (2k+2)t^k$. So, powers of $t$ are eigenfunctions. Any finite-dimensional space of polynomials (other than constants) is not invariant because $L$ preserves the degree. Any general finite-dimensional space of functions will generate an infinite-dimensional space under repeated application of $L$.\n\nThe only non-trivial finite-dimensional invariant subspace is the space of constant functions. If $g(t)=c$ (a constant), then $g'(t)=0$, and $L(c) = 2c$. The space of constants is a 1-dimensional invariant subspace.\n\nThis means the maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra is obtained by including only the constant pressure shifts, i.e., $g(t)=c$.\n*   **Constant pressure shift:** $p' = p+c$.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_p$ (1 generator).\n\n### Step 6: Final Count\n\nThe generators of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries are:\n1.  Time translation ($\\partial_t$): 1 generator\n2.  Space translations ($\\partial_{x_i}$): 3 generators\n3.  Space rotations ($J_i$): 3 generators\n4.  Scaling ($D$): 1 generator\n5.  Constant pressure shift ($\\partial_p$): 1 generator\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of these independent generators: $1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9$."
