    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Group and the Question**\n\n*   **The Group:** We are working with G = PSU(4, 997), the Projective Special Unitary group. Here, the dimension is n=4 and the field size is q=997. Note that 997 is a prime number.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the number of involutions in G. An involution is an element `x` in a group such that `x` is not the identity and `x^2 = 1`.\n\n**2. Relate PSU(n, q) to SU(n, q)**\n\nThe projective special unitary group is defined as the quotient group:\n`PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`\nwhere `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary group and `Z(SU(n, q))` is its center.\n\nAn element `t = gZ` (where `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` and `Z = Z(SU(4, 997))`) is an involution in PSU(4, 997) if and only if:\n1.  `t^2 = 1_G` (where `1_G` is the identity in G), which means `(gZ)^2 = Z`. This implies `g^2 ∈ Z`.\n2.  `t ≠ 1_G`, which means `gZ ≠ Z`. This implies `g ∉ Z`.\n\nSo, our task is to count the number of elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` that satisfy `g² ∈ Z` and `g ∉ Z`, and then divide this count by the size of the center, `|Z|`.\n\n**3. Determine the Center of SU(4, 997)**\n\nThe center of `SU(n, q)` is a cyclic group of order `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n*   In our case, n=4 and q=997.\n*   `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\n*   To compute the gcd: `998 = 2 * 499`. Since 499 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 998 is `2 * 499`. The prime factorization of 4 is `2^2`.\n*   Therefore, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n*   The center `Z` has order 2. In the group of matrices `SU(4, 997)`, this center is `Z = {I, -I}`, where `I` is the 4x4 identity matrix.\n\n**4. Classify and Count the Pre-images in SU(4, 997)**\n\nWe need to count elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `g ∉ {I, -I}` and `g² ∈ {I, -I}`. This search can be split into two disjoint cases:\n\n*   **Case A:** `g² = I` (g is a non-central involution in `SU(4, 997)`).\n*   **Case B:** `g² = -I`.\n\n**5. Analysis of Case A: Elements `g` with `g² = I`**\n\nThese are the involutions in `SU(4, 997)`. Since `g` is an involution, its eigenvalues are `+1` or `-1`. As `g ∈ SU(4, 997)`, we must have `det(g) = 1`. This means the number of `-1` eigenvalues, let's call it `k`, must be even. For a 4x4 matrix, `k` can be 0, 2, or 4.\n*   `k=0`: Eigenvalues are `(1,1,1,1)`. This corresponds to `g=I`, which is in the center `Z`. We must exclude this.\n*   `k=4`: Eigenvalues are `(-1,-1,-1,-1)`. This corresponds to `g=-I`, which is also in the center `Z`. We must exclude this.\n*   `k=2`: Eigenvalues are `(-1,-1,1,1)`. These are the non-central involutions. All such elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4,q)`.\n\nThe number of such elements, `N_A`, is the size of this conjugacy class:\n`N_A = |SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(g)|`\nThe centralizer of such an involution `g` in `U(4,q)` is `U(2,q) × U(2,q)`. The order of the centralizer in `SU(4,q)` is `|U(2,q)|² / (q+1)`.\nUsing the formulas `|SU(4,q)| = q⁶(q-1)²(q+1)²(q²-q+1)(q²+1)` and `|U(2,q)| = q(q-1)(q+1)`, we find:\n`N_A = q⁴(q+1)(q²+1)(q²-q+1)`\n\n**6. Analysis of Case B: Elements `g` with `g² = -I`**\n\nThe eigenvalues `λ` of `g` must satisfy `λ² = -1`. Since `q=997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, the equation `x² = -1` has solutions in the base field `F_q`. Let `j` be such a solution.\nFor an element `g` with `g²=-I` to exist in `U(n,q)` when `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, its eigenspaces corresponding to `j` and `-j` must be totally isotropic. For `n=4`, this forces the eigenspaces to be 2-dimensional each.\n*   This means the eigenvalues of `g` must be `(j, j, -j, -j)`. This ensures `det(g) = j²(-j)² = (-1)(-1) = 1`, so `g ∈ SU(4,q)`.\n*   None of these elements are in the center `Z` (since `I²=I` and `(-I)²=I`, neither squares to `-I`).\n*   The centralizer of such an element in `SU(4,q)` is known to be isomorphic to `GL(2,q)`.\n*   The number of such elements, `N_B`, is the size of this conjugacy class:\n`N_B = |SU(4,q)| / |GL(2,q)|`\nUsing `|GL(2,q)| = q(q-1)²(q+1)`, we find:\n`N_B = q⁵(q+1)(q²+1)(q²-q+1)`\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of pre-images `g` satisfying our conditions (`g ∉ Z, g² ∈ Z`) is `N_A + N_B`.\n*   Total pre-images = `N_A + N_B`\n    `= q⁴(q+1)(q²+1)(q²-q+1) + q⁵(q+1)(q²+1)(q²-q+1)`\n    `= (q⁴ + q⁵)(q+1)(q²+1)(q²-q+1)`\n    `= q⁴(1+q)(q+1)(q²+1)(q²-q+1)`\n    `= q⁴(q+1)²(q²+1)(q²-q+1)`\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4,q)` is this count divided by the order of the center `|Z| = 2`.\nNumber of involutions = `(N_A + N_B) / 2 = (1/2) * q⁴(q+1)²(q²+1)(q²-q+1)`\n\nSubstituting `q=997`:\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * 997⁴ * (997+1)² * (997²+1) * (997²-997+1)`\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * 997⁴ * 998² * (997²+1) * (997²-997+1)`\n\nThis is the final expression for the number of involutions.\n\n***\n\n<<<(1/2) * 997^4 * 998^2 * (997^2+1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)>>>"
