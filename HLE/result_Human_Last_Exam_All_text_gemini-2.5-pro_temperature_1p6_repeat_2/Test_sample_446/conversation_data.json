    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the common motif:** The question presents five different peptides. Observe that all five peptides start with the sequence RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid).\n\n2.  **Recall the biological significance of the RGD motif:** The RGD tripeptide sequence is the most well-known cell recognition motif found in many extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, collagen, and fibrinogen. This motif is recognized and bound by a large family of cell surface receptors called integrins. The binding of RGD-containing proteins to integrins is a fundamental process in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and signaling.\n\n3.  **Understand the role of flanking amino acids:** While the RGD core is essential for binding, the amino acids flanking this motif play a critical role in determining the specificity and affinity of the interaction with different types of integrin receptors. The flanking residues influence the local conformation of the peptide, particularly the spatial orientation of the Arg and Asp side chains, which must fit precisely into the binding pocket of the integrin.\n\n4.  **Analyze each peptide choice:** We need to evaluate the C-terminal sequences following the RGD motif for features that are known to enhance integrin binding.\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** Methionine (M) and Alanine (A) are relatively non-polar. This peptide could potentially bind, but there is no specific structural feature known to strongly promote a high-affinity binding conformation.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the sequence RGDSP. The sequence Serine-Proline (SP) following RGD is famously derived from fibronectin, one of the primary RGD-containing ECM proteins. The Proline (P) residue is structurally significant. Due to its rigid cyclic side chain, proline often induces a specific turn in the peptide backbone, known as a β-turn. This β-turn conformation is crucial because it presents the RGD motif in a sterically favorable way for high-affinity binding to certain integrins, notably the fibronectin receptor (integrin α5β1) and the vitronectin receptor (integrin αvβ3). The RGDSP sequence is a classic, well-studied peptide used to mimic fibronectin binding and inhibit cell adhesion.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** This peptide also contains Proline (P), but it is further from the RGD motif (RGDLTT**P**). The immediate flanking residues (Leucine, Threonine) are different. While the proline might still influence the overall structure, the RGD**SP** motif is the more canonical and well-characterized sequence for inducing the optimal binding conformation.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** This sequence consists of polar (Q, S) and charged (K) amino acids. These could influence electrostatic interactions, but this sequence is not known as a classic high-affinity binding motif in the same way as RGDSP.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** This peptide contains another Arginine (R), adding a positive charge. Again, this sequence is not as well-characterized for high-affinity binding as RGDSP.\n\n5.  **Conclusion based on evidence:** The peptide RGDSPSS is the most likely candidate. The presence of the Proline residue immediately adjacent to the Serine (which follows the RGD core) is a strong indicator of a peptide designed to adopt a β-turn. This conformation has been extensively shown in numerous *in vitro* assays to be critical for high-affinity binding to integrin receptors. Therefore, among the choices given, RGDSPSS is the peptide that has been well-documented to bind integrins effectively.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe key to selecting the correct peptide is recognizing the importance of the conformation of the RGD loop. The RGDSP sequence, present in choice B, is derived from fibronectin. The Proline residue in the +2 position relative to Glycine is well-known to induce a β-turn structure, which optimizes the presentation of the RGD motif for binding to the integrin receptor pocket. This makes RGDSP-containing peptides high-affinity binders. The other sequences lack this well-established conformational constraint.\n\n<<<B>>>"
