    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\nThe question asks for the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group (NS group) of `X`, where `X` is the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface `C`.\n\n*   **C**: A compact Riemann surface of genus `g=3`. This is equivalent to a smooth projective algebraic curve over the complex numbers.\n*   **X = C(15)**: The 15th symmetric power of `C`, denoted `Sym^15(C)`. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on `C`. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X)**: The group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank `ρ(X) = rank(NS(X))` is also known as the Picard number of X. This rank is the dimension of the rational vector space `NS(X) ⊗ Q`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relating NS(X) to C**: The geometry of the symmetric power `X = C(d)` is deeply connected to the geometry of the curve `C`, particularly its Jacobian variety `J(C)`. We need the precise relationship between their Neron-Severi groups.\n2.  **Jacobian Variety J(C)**: For a curve `C` of genus `g`, `J(C)` is a `g`-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety (ppav). For our problem, `g=3`, so `J(C)` is a 3-dimensional ppav.\n3.  **Dependence on the Curve C**: The rank `ρ(J(C))` is not constant for all genus 3 curves; it depends on the specific complex structure of `C`. A \"general\" curve has a Jacobian with minimal `NS` rank, while special curves (like those with extra automorphisms or complex multiplication) can have Jacobians with a larger `NS` rank. We need to find the absolute minimum and maximum `ρ(J(C))` over the entire moduli space of genus 3 curves.\n4.  **Bounds on the Rank**: The rank `ρ(A)` of the NS group of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` has a lower bound of 1 (coming from the polarization) and an upper bound related to the Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A) = g^2`.\n5.  **Existence of Curves**: For the maximum and minimum values to be \"possible\", we must ensure there exist genus 3 curves `C` for which these extremal values of `ρ(J(C))` are achieved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Relate ρ(X) to ρ(J(C))**\n\nThere is a fundamental formula relating the Picard group of a symmetric power of a curve to the Picard group of its Jacobian. For a curve `C` of genus `g ≥ 1` and any degree `d ≥ 1`, there is an isomorphism of groups:\n`NS(C(d)) ≅ Z ⊕ NS(J(C))`\nTaking the ranks of these free abelian groups, we get:\n`ρ(C(d)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\nIn our case, `X = C(15)` and `C` has genus `g=3`. So, the problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(J(C))`.\n\n`ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\n**Step 2: Find the smallest possible rank ρ(J(C))**\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a \"very general\" curve `C`.\n*   A very general curve `C` of genus `g` has a Jacobian `J(C)` which is a simple abelian variety (it does not contain any smaller-dimensional abelian subvarieties).\n*   The endomorphism ring of the Jacobian of a very general curve is just the integers, `End(J(C)) = Z`.\n*   The Neron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` can be identified with the group of endomorphisms that are symmetric with respect to the Rosati involution defined by the principal polarization. When `End(J(C)) = Z`, all endomorphisms are symmetric.\n*   Therefore, for a very general `C`, `NS(J(C)) ≅ Z`. The single generator is the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor `Θ`).\n*   Thus, the minimum possible rank is `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for `ρ(X)`:\n`ρ(X)_min = 1 + ρ(J(C))_min = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the largest possible rank ρ(J(C))**\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of a `g`-dimensional abelian variety `A` is bounded above by the Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A)`.\n*   For an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g`, `h^{1,0}(A) = g`, so `h^{1,1}(A) = h^{1,0}(A) × h^{0,1}(A) = g × g = g^2`.\n*   For `J(C)`, `g=3`, so `ρ(J(C)) ≤ h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9`.\nThis upper bound `ρ(A) = g^2` is known to be achievable for certain abelian varieties with complex multiplication (CM). We need to determine if a Jacobian of a genus 3 curve can achieve this maximum.\n\nConsider the Fermat curve of degree 4, `F_4`, given by the equation `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`.\n*   This is a smooth plane curve of degree 4, so its genus is `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n*   The Jacobian `J(F_4)` is a 3-dimensional ppav. It is a classical result that `J(F_4)` has complex multiplication. Specifically, `J(F_4)` is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve `E`, `J(F_4) ~ E^3`, where `E` is the elliptic curve `y^2 = x^3 - x`.\n*   The curve `E` has CM by the ring of Gaussian integers `Z[i]`.\n*   An isogeny induces an isomorphism between the Neron-Severi groups after tensoring with `Q`, so `ρ(J(F_4)) = ρ(E^3)`.\n*   We can compute `ρ(E^3)`. `End(E^3) = M_3(End(E)) = M_3(Z[i])`. The Neron-Severi group `NS(E^3)` corresponds to endomorphisms fixed by the Rosati involution, which for the product polarization on `E^3` is the conjugate transpose map `M \\mapsto \\bar{M}^t`.\n*   We need to find the rank of the `Z`-module of `3 × 3` matrices `H` over `Z[i]` such that `H = \\bar{H}^t` (Hermitian matrices).\n*   A `3 × 3` Hermitian matrix `H` has diagonal entries in `Z` (3 generators) and the upper triangle entries are arbitrary elements of `Z[i]` (3 entries, each with 2 generators over `Z`).\n*   The total rank is `3 + 3 × 2 = 9`.\n*   So, `ρ(E^3) = 9`. Since the Fermat curve `F_4` exists, a genus 3 curve `C` can have `ρ(J(C))=9`.\n\nThis gives the largest possible rank for `ρ(X)`:\n`ρ(X)_max = 1 + ρ(J(C))_max = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank of `NS(X)` is `2`, achieved when `C` is a very general genus 3 curve.\n*   The largest possible rank of `NS(X)` is `10`, achieved when `C` is the Fermat curve of degree 4.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Smallest possible rank: `1 + ρ(J(C))_min = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   Largest possible rank: `1 + ρ(J(C))_max = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
