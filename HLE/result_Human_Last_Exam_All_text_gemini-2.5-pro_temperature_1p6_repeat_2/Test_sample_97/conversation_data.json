    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is added to pure water, two main processes involving the aluminum species occur, in addition to the autoionization of water.\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃ to form Al³⁺ ions:** This is governed by the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion:** The dissolved Al³⁺ can react with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, [Al(OH)₄]⁻. This is governed by the formation constant, K_f.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> [Al(OH)₄]⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹\n\n3.  **Autoionization of water:** Water itself provides a source of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions.\n    H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**Step 2: Define the solubility and set up the master equation.**\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\n\nTo solve for the unknown concentrations, we use the principle of charge neutrality. The total positive charge in the solution must equal the total negative charge.\nTotal positive charge = 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]\nTotal negative charge = [OH⁻] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\nTherefore, the charge balance equation is:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable.**\nIt is convenient to express all concentrations in terms of [OH⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = K_sp / x³\n\n*   From the K_f expression, we can find [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]:\n    [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n    Substitute the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / x³) * x⁴ = (K_sp * K_f) * x\n\n*   From the K_w expression:\n    [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = K_w / x\n\n**Step 4: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation.**\n3(K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = x + (K_sp * K_f) * x\n\nNow, plug in the known values:\nK_sp = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\nK_f = 1.1 * 10³¹\nK_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\nK_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) = 5.83 * 10⁴\n\n3(5.3 * 10⁻²⁷ / x³) + (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ / x) = x + (5.83 * 10⁴) * x\n1.59 * 10⁻²⁶ / x³ + 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ / x = (1 + 5.83 * 10⁴) * x\n\n**Step 5: Solve the equation for x = [OH⁻].**\nTo eliminate the denominators, multiply the entire equation by x³:\n1.59 * 10⁻²⁶ + (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) * x² = (58301) * x⁴\nRearrange this into the form of a quadratic equation for x²:\n58301 * (x²)² - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) * x² - 1.59 * 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nLet y = x². The equation becomes:\n58301y² - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)y - 1.59 * 10⁻²⁶ = 0\nUse the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\na = 58301\nb = -1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\nc = -1.59 * 10⁻²⁶\n\nb² - 4ac = (-1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(58301)(-1.59 * 10⁻²⁶) = 1.0 * 10⁻²⁸ + 3.706 * 10⁻²¹ ≈ 3.706 * 10⁻²¹\nsqrt(b² - 4ac) ≈ sqrt(3.706 * 10⁻²¹) ≈ 6.088 * 10⁻¹¹\n\ny = [ -(-1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) + 6.088 * 10⁻¹¹ ] / (2 * 58301)  (We take the positive root since y = x² must be positive)\ny ≈ (6.088 * 10⁻¹¹) / 116602 ≈ 5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶\n\nSo, x² = [OH⁻]² = 5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶\nx = [OH⁻] = sqrt(5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and the total solubility.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of OH⁻, we can find the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³\n    [Al³⁺] ≈ 4.44 * 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n\n*   [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)\n    [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total solubility S is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\nS ≈ (4.44 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)\nS ≈ 0.000444 + 0.00133\nS ≈ 1.774 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given K_sp and K_f values:\nS ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
