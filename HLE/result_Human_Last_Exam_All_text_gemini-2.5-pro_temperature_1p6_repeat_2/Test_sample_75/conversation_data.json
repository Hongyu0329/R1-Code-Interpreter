    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to determine the length of the Second Great War in the StarCraft universe, expressed in years and rounded up to the nearest whole year.\n\n2.  **Define the \"Second Great War\":** In StarCraft lore, the Second Great War refers to the galaxy-spanning conflict that takes place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This includes the storylines of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void* (including the epilogue, *Into the Void*).\n\n3.  **Establish the Start and End Points of the War:**\n    *   **Start Date:** The war is considered to begin with the renewed Zerg invasion of Dominion space, specifically the attack on the planet Mar Sara. According to the official lore and established timelines, this event occurs in the year **2504**. This kicks off the campaign of *Wings of Liberty*.\n    *   **End Date:** The war concludes with the final defeat of the ultimate antagonist, Amon, in the Void. This happens in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, which follows the events of *Legacy of the Void*. These final events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Time Span:**\n    *   The war begins in the year 2504.\n    *   The conflict continues through the entirety of the year 2505 (the setting for *Heart of the Swarm*).\n    *   The war concludes in the year 2506 (the setting for *Legacy of the Void* and the epilogue).\n    *   This means the war's timeline spans across three separate calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Duration and Consider \"Rounded Up\":**\n    *   A simple subtraction of the years (2506 - 2504 = 2) is inaccurate because it doesn't account for the portions of time within the start and end years.\n    *   The total duration is the sum of:\n        *   The portion of the year 2504 during which the war was active.\n        *   The full year of 2505.\n        *   The portion of the year 2506 until the war ended.\n    *   So, the duration = (Fraction of 2504) + 1 year + (Fraction of 2506).\n    *   For the total duration to be 2 years or less, the combined time from the start of the war to the end of 2504 and the start of 2506 to the end of the war would have to be 1 year or less. (e.g., starting in October 2504 and ending in June 2506 gives a total duration of 1 year and 8 months, which rounds up to 2).\n    *   However, a more plausible timeline, considering the gaps between campaigns (Kerrigan's recovery and rebuilding the Swarm, Artanis preparing the Golden Armada), suggests the total duration almost certainly exceeded two full years. For instance, if the war began in March 2504 and ended in June 2506, the total duration would be 2 years and 3 months.\n    *   Since the duration spans three calendar years and involves significant events and time skips between campaigns, a total length of over two years is the most logical conclusion.\n    *   The question requires the answer to be **rounded up**. This means if the duration is anything greater than 2.0 years (e.g., 2.1 years, 2.5 years), the answer must be 3. Given that a duration over 2 years is highly probable, rounding up leads to 3.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   War Starts: Year 2504\n*   War Ends: Year 2506\n*   The conflict spans across three calendar years.\n*   Plausible duration based on events is greater than 2 years.\n*   Rounding any value greater than 2.0 up to the nearest year results in 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
