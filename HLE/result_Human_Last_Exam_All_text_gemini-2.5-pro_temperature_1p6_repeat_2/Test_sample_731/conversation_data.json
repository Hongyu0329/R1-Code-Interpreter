    "Answering the question requires a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group in question.**\nThe group is the semidihedral group of size 512. This is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$.\nThe standard presentation for a semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ for $n \\ge 4$ is:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, sr = r^{-1+2^{n-2}}s \\rangle$.\nFor our case, $n=9$. So the group is:\n$G = SD_{2^9} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = 1, sr = r^{-1+2^7}s \\rangle$.\nThis means:\n*   The order of the group is $|G| = 2^9 = 512$.\n*   The element $r$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $2^8 = 256$.\n*   The element $s$ has order 2.\n*   The commutation relation is $sr = r^{127}s$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the concept of a power subgroup.**\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nIt is important to note that for an arbitrary group $G$ and integer $k$, the set $G^k$ is not always a subgroup. The question asks for the cases where it is a subgroup. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the problem by using the group exponent.**\nA crucial property for finite groups is that for any integer $k$, the set of $k$-th powers is the same as the set of $d$-th powers, where $d = \\gcd(k, \\exp(G))$, and $\\exp(G)$ is the exponent of the group (the smallest integer $m>0$ such that $g^m=1$ for all $g \\in G$).\nSo, $G^k = G^{\\gcd(k, \\exp(G))}$.\nThis means we only need to consider the sets $G^d$ where $d$ is a divisor of the exponent of $G$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the exponent of $SD_{512}$.**\nThe elements of $G=SD_{512}$ are of two forms:\n1.  $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. The orders of these elements are the divisors of 256, i.e., $2^j$ for $j=0, \\dots, 8$. The maximum order is 256.\n2.  $r^i s$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. Let's find the order of these elements.\n    $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (sr^i s^{-1}) s^2 = r^i (r^{127})^i (1) = r^i r^{127i} = r^{128i}$.\n    Since the order of $r$ is 256, $r^{128i}$ is 1 if $128i$ is a multiple of 256, which means $i$ must be even. If $i$ is odd, $r^{128i} = r^{128}$.\n    *   If $i$ is even, $(r^i s)^2=1$. These elements have order 2.\n    *   If $i$ is odd, $(r^i s)^2=r^{128} \\ne 1$. Then $(r^i s)^4 = (r^{128})^2 = r^{256} = 1$. These elements have order 4.\nThe set of all possible element orders is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, \\dots, 256\\}$. The least common multiple of these orders is the exponent.\n$\\exp(SD_{512}) = \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 4, \\dots, 256) = 256$.\n\n**Step 5: Identify all possible power subgroups.**\nAccording to Step 3, we only need to examine $G^d$ for all divisors $d$ of 256. The divisors of $256=2^8$ are $2^j$ for $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots, 8$. There are 9 such divisors.\n\nLet's compute $G^{2^j}$ for $j=0, \\dots, 8$:\n*   **$j=0, d=1$**: $G^1 = \\{g^1 \\mid g \\in G\\} = G$. $G$ is trivially a subgroup of itself.\n*   **$j=1, d=2$**: $G^2 = \\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We analyze the squares of all elements:\n    *   For elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$: $\\{(r^i)^2\\} = \\{r^{2i}\\} = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$: $\\{(r^i s)^2\\} = \\{r^{128i}\\} = \\{1, r^{128}\\}$.\n    So, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{1, r^{128}\\}$. Since $r^{128} = (r^{64})^2$, it is already an element of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. Thus, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$, which is a cyclic subgroup of order 128.\n*   **$j \\ge 2, d=2^j$**: $G^{2^j} = \\{g^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    *   For elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$: $\\{(r^i)^{2^j}\\} = \\{r^{i \\cdot 2^j}\\} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$: $(r^i s)^{2^j} = ((r^i s)^4)^{2^{j-2}} = 1^{2^{j-2}} = 1$ (since $j \\ge 2$).\n    So, $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup for each $j \\in \\{2, 3, \\dots, 8\\}$.\n\n**Step 6: Count the number of distinct subgroups.**\nThe power subgroups we have found are:\n1.  $G^1 = G$ (order 512)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (order $256/2 = 128$)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (order $256/4 = 64$)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (order $256/8 = 32$)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (order $256/16 = 16$)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (order $256/32 = 8$)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (order $256/64 = 4$)\n8.  $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (order $256/128 = 2$)\n9.  $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\nAll these subgroups have different orders, so they are all distinct. There are 9 distinct subgroups in this list. Since we have considered all divisors of the group exponent, we have found all possible power subgroups.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
