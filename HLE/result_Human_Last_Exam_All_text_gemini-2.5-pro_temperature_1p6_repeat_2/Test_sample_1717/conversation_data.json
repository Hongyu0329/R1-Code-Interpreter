    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Base Health**\nFirst, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's source code and official documentation, the base health values are different for each difficulty.\n*   Classic Mode: 2800 HP\n*   **Expert Mode: 3640 HP**\n*   Master Mode: 4641 HP\n\nThe relevant value for this question is the Expert Mode base health of **3640**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula**\nIn Terraria, boss health increases in multiplayer to provide a challenge for more than one player. The scaling rules differ between game modes. For Expert Mode, the health scales according to a specific formula.\n*   The health multiplier starts at 1x for a single player.\n*   For each additional player present in the world when the boss is spawned, the health multiplier increases by a specific factor.\n*   In Expert Mode, this increase is **35% (or 0.35)** for each player after the first.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Full Health Equation**\nWe can now combine the base health and the scaling factor into a single mathematical function. Let `H` be the total health and `n` be the number of players.\n\n*   `Total Health (H) = Base Health × Health Multiplier`\n*   The `Health Multiplier` for `n` players is calculated as: `1 + 0.35 × (n - 1)`.\n    *   The `1` represents the base multiplier for the first player.\n    *   `(n - 1)` represents the number of *additional* players.\n    *   `0.35` is the scaling factor per additional player.\n\n*   Substituting the values for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, the equation becomes:\n    `H(n) = 3640 × (1 + 0.35 × (n - 1))`\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Equation for an Infinite Number of Players**\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This is a mathematical limit problem where we need to find what happens to `H(n)` as `n` approaches infinity (`n → ∞`).\n\nLet's simplify the function `H(n)`:\n1.  Distribute the `0.35`:\n    `H(n) = 3640 × (1 + 0.35n - 0.35)`\n2.  Combine the constant terms inside the parentheses:\n    `H(n) = 3640 × (0.65 + 0.35n)`\n3.  Distribute the `3640`:\n    `H(n) = (3640 × 0.65) + (3640 × 0.35)n`\n    `H(n) = 2366 + 1274n`\n\nThe final simplified equation, `H(n) = 1274n + 2366`, is a linear function. As the number of players (`n`) increases, the total health `H(n)` also increases without bound.\n\nTo find the theoretical maximum, we take the limit of this function as `n` approaches infinity:\n`lim (n→∞) (1274n + 2366)`\n\nAs `n` becomes infinitely large, the term `1274n` also becomes infinitely large. The constant `2366` becomes insignificant in comparison. Therefore, the limit is infinity.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Game Mode:** The health value and scaling factor are specific to Expert Mode and would be different in Classic or Master Mode.\n*   **Theoretical vs. Practical Limits:** The question asks for the *theoretical* maximum, which implies using the mathematical formula. In practice, the game has a player limit (255) and the health value is stored as a 32-bit integer, which has a maximum value of 2,147,483,647. However, the concept of \"infinite players\" directs the analysis towards the mathematical limit, not these technical constraints.\n*   **Formula Accuracy:** The formula `1 + 0.35 * (n - 1)` is derived directly from how the game code calculates boss health in Expert Mode multiplayer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the linear scaling of boss health with the number of players, there is no mathematical upper bound. As the number of players approaches infinity, the Eye of Cthulhu's health also approaches infinity.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
