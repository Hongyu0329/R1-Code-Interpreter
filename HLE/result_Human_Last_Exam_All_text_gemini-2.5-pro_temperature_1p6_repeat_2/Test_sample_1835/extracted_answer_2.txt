Yes. According to the principle of systematicity and recombinability that underlies the Generality Constraint, the ability to understand `Fa` entails having a general concept of the predicate `F`. The ability to understand universal quantification entails having a general concept of the logical operator `∀x(...)`. Possessing both of these general, recombinable conceptual abilities means you should be able to combine them to understand the proposition `∀x(Fx)`. To be unable to do so would imply that your grasp of `F` was not truly general, thus violating the constraint.
