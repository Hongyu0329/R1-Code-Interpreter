    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Properties of the Function f**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n*   **Injectivity of f:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this becomes $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$.\n    Since the exponential function $y \\mapsto e^y$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Thus, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n    This proves that $f$ is an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n*   **Monotonicity of f:**\n    A fundamental theorem in real analysis states that any continuous and injective function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**2. Case 1: f is strictly decreasing**\n\n*   A continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have exactly one fixed point.\n    *   **Proof:** Let $g(x) = f(x) - x$. As $f$ is decreasing, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L$ (could be $-\\infty$) and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$ (could be $+\\infty$) with $L \\le M$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = L - \\infty = -\\infty$. Thus, there exists some $a$ for which $g(a) < 0$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = M - (-\\infty) = +\\infty$. Thus, there exists some $b$ for which $g(b) > 0$.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point $p$ between $a$ and $b$ such that $g(p) = 0$. This means $f(p) - p = 0$, so $f(p) = p$. This proves the existence of a fixed point. Uniqueness follows because if $p_1 < p_2$, then $f(p_1)>f(p_2)$, so we can't have $f(p_1)=p_1$ and $f(p_2)=p_2$ simultaneously.\n\n*   Now, suppose such a decreasing function $f$ exists. Let $p$ be its unique fixed point, so $f(p) = p$.\n*   Applying $f$ to the fixed point equation, we get $f(f(p)) = f(p)$.\n*   Since $f(p)=p$, this becomes $f(f(p))=p$.\n*   From the original equation, we have $f(f(p)) = e^p$.\n*   Therefore, we must have $e^p = p$.\n\n*   However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions.\n    *   For $x \\le 0$, $e^x > 0 \\ge x$.\n    *   For $x > 0$, the function $h(x) = e^x - x$ has derivative $h'(x) = e^x - 1 > 0$, so it is strictly increasing. Its minimum value is at $x=0$, where $h(0) = e^0-0=1$. So $e^x-x \\ge 1 > 0$ for $x>0$.\n    *   Thus, $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   The requirement $e^p=p$ leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the given equation.\n\n**3. Case 2: f is strictly increasing**\n\n*   If $f$ is strictly increasing, it may or may not have a fixed point.\n*   If $f$ had a fixed point $p$, we would have $f(p)=p$. This would lead to the same contradiction $e^p=p$ as in the decreasing case. So, an increasing solution $f$ cannot have any fixed points.\n*   For a continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with no fixed points, it must be the case that either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   Let's test these two sub-cases:\n    *   **Subcase 2a: $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.** Since $f$ is strictly increasing, if we apply $f$ to this inequality, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining the inequalities, we have $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This implies $e^x < x$, which we have shown is false for all real $x$. So this case is impossible.\n    *   **Subcase 2b: $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.** If we apply the increasing function $f$ to this inequality, we get $f(f(x)) > f(x)$. Combining these, we have $f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$. This implies $e^x > x$, which is true for all real $x$. This case is consistent.\n\n*   So, any solution must be a strictly increasing function satisfying $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**4. Constructing and Counting the Solutions**\n\nWe can construct such functions. The general method shows there are infinitely many. Let's outline the construction to determine the cardinality.\n\n1.  Let's define $f$ on an interval. A key property derived from $f(f(x))=e^x$ and the fact that $f$ is increasing is that $f$ must commute with $e^x$, i.e., $f(e^x) = f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$.\n2.  Let $f(0) = c$. Since $f(x)>x$, we have $c=f(0)>0$. From $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$, we have $f(c) = 1$. Since $f$ is increasing, $f(0)<f(c)$, which means $c<1$. So, we must have $c \\in (0,1)$.\n3.  Let's define $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$. It must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps $[0, c]$ to $[f(0), f(c)] = [c, 1]$. We also need to satisfy the condition $f(x)>x$. As a stronger condition required by the global solution, we can show that we must pick $f$ on $[0, c]$ such that $x < f(x) < e^x$.\n4.  **Freedom of choice:** For any choice of $c \\in (0,1)$, we can choose an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$ such that $h(0)=c$, $h(c)=1$ and for all $x \\in (0,c)$, we have $x < h(x) < e^x$. This is possible because $0<c<1$ and $c<1<e^c$. There is a \"space\" between the graphs of $y=x$ and $y=e^x$ to define such a function. The number of such functions $h$ is uncountably infinite; it has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n5.  **Extending the function:** Once we have chosen $c \\in (0,1)$ and defined $f$ on $[0,c]$ as the function $h$, the function $f$ is uniquely determined everywhere else.\n    *   For $x \\in [c, 1]$, we must have $f(x) = f(f(h^{-1}(x))) = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$.\n    *   This defines $f$ on $[0,1]$. We can then extend $f$ to $[1, \\infty)$ by repeatedly using the relation $f(y) = e^{f^{-1}(y)}$ where $y$ is in the range of the already-defined part of $f$.\n    *   We can extend $f$ to $(-\\infty, 0)$ by using the relation $f^{-1}(y) = \\ln(f(y))$.\n6.  This construction process shows that for each choice of $c \\in (0,1)$ and each valid choice of the function $h$ on $[0,c]$, we get a unique solution $f \\in S$.\n7.  The number of choices for $c$ is $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n8.  For a fixed $c$, the number of choices for the function $h$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n9.  The total number of solutions is therefore at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. The total number of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the cardinality of the set of solutions must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe set of solutions $S$ is composed entirely of strictly increasing functions. The construction of these solutions reveals a high degree of freedom, leading to uncountably many solutions. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$ (also denoted $2^{\\aleph_0}$), which is the size of the set of real numbers."
