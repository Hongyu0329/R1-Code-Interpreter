The functional dependence is an inverse linear relationship of the form $G_0 \propto (\omega - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$. The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ has a simple pole at the single-particle energy $\epsilon_k$. The full expression is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}$.
