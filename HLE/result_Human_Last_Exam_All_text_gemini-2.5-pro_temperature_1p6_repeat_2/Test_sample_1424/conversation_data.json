    "Of course. Let's break down the question and derive the answer methodically.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the **functional dependence** of the **bare Green's function ($G_0$)** on the **single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)** within the **Feynman path integral formalism**.\n\nTo answer this, we need to:\n1.  Define the bare Green's function using the path integral.\n2.  Write down the non-interacting action ($S_0$) that goes into the path integral.\n3.  Show how the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ appear in this action.\n4.  Perform the path integral to find the Green's function.\n5.  From the final expression, identify the explicit functional relationship between $G_0$ and $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: The Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Feynman path integral provides a way to calculate quantum mechanical expectation values. The two-point Green's function (or propagator) for a fermionic system is defined as the time-ordered expectation value of a particle creation and annihilation event. In the path integral formalism, this is expressed as a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields, $\\psi(x)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(x)$, where $x=(t, \\mathbf{r})$:\n\n$G_0(x, x') = \\langle T[\\psi(x) \\bar{\\psi}(x')] \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x) \\bar{\\psi}(x') \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n\nHere, the subscript '0' on $G_0$ and $S_0$ signifies that we are considering a **non-interacting** (or \"bare\") system.\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action for a system of non-interacting fermions is described by a single-particle Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0$. The action is given by:\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\, d^d\\mathbf{r} \\, \\bar{\\psi}(t, \\mathbf{r}) \\left( i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(t, \\mathbf{r})$\n\nFor simplicity, we will set $\\hbar=1$ from now on.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalizing the Action via Fourier Transform**\n\nThe dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, becomes explicit when we work in the basis that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$. This is typically the momentum basis (for continuous systems) or a basis labeled by some quantum number `k` (e.g., crystal momentum). The eigenstates $|k\\rangle$ of $\\hat{H}_0$ have energies $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n$\\hat{H}_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\nWe perform a Fourier transform of the fields from spacetime $(t, \\mathbf{r})$ to frequency-momentum space $(\\omega, \\mathbf{k})$:\n\n$\\psi(t, \\mathbf{r}) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\frac{d^dk}{(2\\pi)^d} \\, e^{-i(\\omega t - \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})} \\psi(\\omega, \\mathbf{k})$\n\nSubstituting this into the action, the operators transform into algebraic factors:\n*   The time derivative operator $i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes a factor of $\\omega$.\n*   The Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}_0$ becomes the eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe action simplifies dramatically and becomes diagonal in the $(\\omega, \\mathbf{k})$ basis:\n\n$S_0 = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\frac{d^dk}{(2\\pi)^d} \\, \\bar{\\psi}(\\omega, \\mathbf{k}) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi(\\omega, \\mathbf{k})$\n\nWe can now clearly see the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ appearing as the kernel of our quadratic action.\n\n**Step 4: Deriving the Green's Function from the Path Integral**\n\nIn the path integral formalism, the Green's function in Fourier space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is simply the inverse of the kernel of the action. To see this more formally, one can calculate the integral using source terms, but the result is standard:\n\n$S_0 = \\int d\\omega dk \\, \\bar{\\psi}(k, \\omega) \\, [G_0(k, \\omega)]^{-1} \\, \\psi(k, \\omega)$\n\nBy comparing this general form with our derived action, we can identify:\n\n$[G_0(k, \\omega)]^{-1} = \\omega - \\epsilon_k$\n\nInverting this gives the Green's function:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 5: Finalizing the Expression (The $i\\delta$ Prescription)**\n\nThe expression above has a singularity (a pole) on the real $\\omega$-axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. To correctly handle this pole and ensure that our propagator respects causality (i.e., particles propagate forward in time), the path integral formalism naturally introduces an infinitesimal imaginary part, commonly denoted as $i\\delta$ or $i\\eta$ (with $\\delta \\to 0^+$). This effectively shifts the pole slightly off the real axis.\n\nThe standard Feynman (or causal) Green's function, which arises from the time-ordered prescription, is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nThe sign of the $i\\delta$ term can depend on whether the state `k` is an occupied \"hole\" state or an unoccupied \"particle\" state, but the form above is the most common representation for a particle propagator.\n\n**Summary of the Functional Dependence**\n\nFrom the final expression, $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$, we can analyze the functional dependence:\n\n*   The bare Green's function $G_0$ is a function of both frequency $\\omega$ and the quantum number `k`.\n*   Its dependence on the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$ is an **inverse linear relationship**.\n*   Specifically, $G_0$ has a **simple pole** in the complex frequency plane at $\\omega \\approx \\epsilon_k$. The location of this pole is the defining characteristic of a non-interacting particle excitation—it tells you the energy required to create that particle.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Interacting:** This derivation is strictly for the **bare** Green's function ($G_0$). For an interacting system, the Green's function $G$ is modified by a self-energy term $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$, becoming $G(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, \\omega))^{-1}$.\n2.  **Fourier Space:** The simple inverse relationship is only evident in the Fourier space $(\\omega, k)$ that diagonalizes the non-interacting Hamiltonian. In real space $(t, \\mathbf{r})$, the relationship is much more complex, involving an integral over all `k` modes.\n3.  **Physical Meaning of the Pole:** The pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ is not just a mathematical feature. It signifies a long-lived (in this bare case, infinitely long-lived) excitation of the system with precisely the energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n4.  **The $i\\delta$ Prescription:** The inclusion of the infinitesimal $i\\delta$ is crucial. It is a mathematical device that encodes the physical principle of causality and is a direct consequence of the time-ordering operator in the definition of the Green's function. Without it, the integral over the pole is ill-defined.\n5.  **Units:** We used natural units where $\\hbar=1$. If $\\hbar$ is retained, the expression is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$. The functional form remains the same.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ in frequency-momentum space has an inverse linear dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. The explicit functional form is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the frequency, `k` is the quantum number (e.g., momentum) labeling the eigenstate, and $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. This means the bare Green's function has a simple pole at the energy of the single-particle state.\n\n<<<The functional dependence is an inverse linear relationship of the form $G_0 \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$. The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a simple pole at the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$. The full expression is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$.>>>"
