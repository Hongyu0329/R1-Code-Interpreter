    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions and the setup.**\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable (H.I.) Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. An indecomposable continuum cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A classic example of an H.I. metric continuum is the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$.\n*   **The Space:** We start with an H.I. metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$. We consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n*   **The Object of Interest:** We are asked about the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $Y$, which is denoted by $Y^*$ or $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. The Stone-Cech remainder is $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the topological properties of the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.**\n\n1.  Since $X$ is a compact metric space, it is separable. $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is an open subset of a separable metric space, so $Y$ is also a separable metric space.\n2.  $X$ is compact and $\\{x\\}$ is closed, so $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is an open subset of $X$. Since $X$ is a continuum (and thus has more than one point), $Y$ is non-empty. As the complement of a single point in a connected space of more than one point, $Y$ is not compact.\n3.  Any open subset of a compact Hausdorff space is locally compact. Thus, $Y$ is a locally compact space.\n4.  A fundamental property of locally compact separable metric spaces is that they are **$\\sigma$-compact**. A space is $\\sigma$-compact if it is a countable union of compact sets. We can see this directly for $Y$: let $d$ be the metric on $X$. Then $Y = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\{y \\in X \\mid d(y,x) \\ge 1/n\\}$. Each set in this union is a closed subset of the compact space $X$, hence compact, and their union is clearly $Y$. So, $Y$ is a locally compact, separable, metric, $\\sigma$-compact space.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the properties of the Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$.**\n\nWe need to know the structure of $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$. Two key theorems are essential here.\n\n1.  **Metrizability of the Remainder:** A fundamental theorem in topology states that for a locally compact, $\\sigma$-compact Hausdorff space $Y$, its Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$ is compact and **metrizable**. Since we have established that $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is locally compact and $\\sigma$-compact, its remainder $Y^*$ must be a compact metrizable space.\n2.  **Structure of the Remainder:** A theorem by E. D. Tymchatyn (1979) states that if $C$ is a subcontinuum of a hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$, then the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus C) \\setminus (X \\setminus C)$ is also a hereditary indecomposable continuum. In our problem, we take $C = \\{x\\}$, which is a point. A single point is a compact and connected set, so it is a subcontinuum. Applying Tymchatyn's theorem, we conclude that $Y^*$ is a **hereditary indecomposable continuum**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the properties of $Y^*$ and count its composants.**\n\nFrom Step 3, we know that $Y^*$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n\n1.  By definition, any hereditary indecomposable continuum is indecomposable.\n2.  A celebrated theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that every indecomposable **metric** continuum has exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by $c$) composants.\n3.  Since $Y^*$ is an indecomposable metric continuum, it must have $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion.**\n\nThe argument above holds for *any* choice of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$. The conclusion that the remainder has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants is universal under the given hypotheses. Therefore, the number of composants is always $2^{\\aleph_0}$. The question asks for the maximum possible number, which in this case is the only possible number.\n\n**Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls:**\n\n*   **Metric vs. Non-Metric:** The property that $X$ is a *metric* continuum is crucial. If $X$ were a non-metric H.I. continuum, $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ would not necessarily be $\\sigma$-compact, and its remainder would not necessarily be metrizable. Non-metric H.I. continua can have other numbers of composants (e.g., any integer $n \\geq 2$, or countably infinite). For example, Jan van Mill constructed a (non-metric) H.I. continuum $X$ where the remainder of $X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ has only one composant. This does not contradict our finding, because the premise of the problem (that $X$ is metric) is not satisfied in those cases.\n*   **Theorems Used:** The solution relies on a combination of results from general topology (properties of remainders) and continuum theory (properties of indecomposable continua). The key links are the theorem on the metrizability of remainders of $\\sigma$-compact spaces and Tymchatyn's theorem on the structure of such remainders.\n*   **Number of Composants:** For indecomposable metric continua, the number of composants is fixed at $2^{\\aleph_0}$. For general indecomposable continua, the number can vary. The metrizability of the remainder is the decisive factor.\n\nThe maximum possible number of a property that is in fact constant is that constant value itself."
