The proposed filtering strategy is to first perform a differential gene expression analysis comparing the CAR-IL15 group against the CAR-only group (contrast: CAR-IL15 vs. CAR-only). Then, use a command-line tool like `awk` to parse the resulting data file. Identify contaminant genes by applying a combined filter to identify genes that are significantly and strongly downregulated in the CAR-IL15 group. The specific criteria would be a **log2 fold change less than -2** and an **adjusted p-value (padj/FDR) less than 0.05**. A list of these putative contaminant gene IDs should be generated. Finally, use this list with a tool like `grep` to remove these genes from the original differential expression results file, producing a final, cleaned dataset for downstream analysis.
