    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe core of the problem is to translate a given nucleotide sequence. The key piece of information is that this sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. A sequence from the middle of an ORF should not contain any in-frame stop codons.\n\n**2. List the Three Possible Reading Frames**\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different ways on the same strand, depending on which nucleotide you start with. These are called reading frames.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n*   **Reading Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n*   **Reading Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\nWe will translate the sequence in each of these three frames and check for the presence of stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n\n**3. Analyze Reading Frame 1**\n*   **Grouping into codons:**\n    `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc...`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `cat` -> H (Histidine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains a premature stop codon (`tag`) very early in the sequence. This cannot be the correct reading frame for a sequence from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**4. Analyze Reading Frame 2**\n*   **Grouping into codons (ignore the first nucleotide 'g'):**\n    `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The last 'c' is an incomplete codon and is ignored).\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame translates into a continuous protein sequence with no stop codons. This is a strong candidate for the correct frame.\n\n**5. Analyze Reading Frame 3**\n*   **Grouping into codons (ignore the first two nucleotides 'gg'):**\n    `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac ccc...`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `aca` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gcg` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `act` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 also contains a premature stop codon (`tga`). This cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly **Reading Frame 2** results in a continuous amino acid sequence without any stop codons, which is what is expected for a nucleotide sequence taken from the middle of an Open Reading Frame.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe correct reading frame is Frame 2.\nThe translated protein sequence is:\nDIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPLYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPLYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
