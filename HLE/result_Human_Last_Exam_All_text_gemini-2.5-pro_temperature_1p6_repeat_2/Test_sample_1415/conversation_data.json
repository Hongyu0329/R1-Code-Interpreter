    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\nThe integral to be evaluated is `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is a special form. We know that the derivative of `ln(f(x))` is `f'(x)/f(x)`.\nTherefore, the integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is the derivative of `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n`∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = [ln|F₃(x)|]`\nSo, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can be written as:\n`V = ln( |F₃(1) / F₃(0)| )`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the value of F₃(0)**\nWe follow the chain of functions for x = 0:\n*   `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e^0 = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the value of F₃(1)**\nWe follow the chain of functions for x = 1. Note that trigonometric functions in calculus use radians by default.\n*   `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)`\n*   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the values back into the integral expression for V**\nWe first check if the arguments of the logarithm are positive.\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693`, which is positive. So, `|F₃(0)| = F₃(0)`.\n*   For `F₃(1)`, since `0 < 1 < π/2`, `sin(1)` is positive. Therefore, `e^(sin(1))` > 1. This means `1 + e^(sin(1))` > 2, and `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is positive. So, `|F₃(1)| = F₃(1)`.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the expression for `V`:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n`V = ln( (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) )`\n\n**Step 6: Numerically evaluate V**\nWe use a calculator to find the numerical value.\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147) ≈ 2.31977`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(1 + 2.31977) = ln(3.31977) ≈ 1.19985`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.69315`\nNow, substitute these into the expression for `V`:\n`V ≈ ln( 1.19985 / 0.69315 )`\n`V ≈ ln(1.73104)`\n`V ≈ 0.54874`\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54874 = 5487.4`\nThe closest integer to 5487.4 is 5487.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Integral Form:** Recognizing `∫ f'(x)/f(x) dx = ln|f(x)|` is the key to solving the problem without explicitly differentiating the complex function `F₃(x)`.\n*   **Radians:** `sin(1)` implies 1 radian, not 1 degree.\n*   **Function Composition:** Carefully evaluate the functions `F₀`, `F₁`, `F₂`, `F₃` in the correct order for `x=0` and `x=1`.\n*   **Absolute Value:** Confirm that `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)` are positive before dropping the absolute value signs.\n*   **Final Step:** The final answer is not the value of the integral `V`, but `10000 * V` rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
