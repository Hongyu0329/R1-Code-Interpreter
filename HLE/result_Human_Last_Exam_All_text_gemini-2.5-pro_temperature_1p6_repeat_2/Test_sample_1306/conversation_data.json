    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage of irreducible objects in the category of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Representations\n\nLet $U_q = u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ be the quantum group, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$). Let $l=3$ be the order of $q$. When $q$ is a root of unity, the representation theory of $U_q$ is substantially different from the generic case. A key feature is that the elements $E^l, F^l, K^l$ (in our case $E^3, F^3, K^3$) are central in the algebra.\n\nA finite-dimensional representation of $U_q$ is a module over $U_q$. By Schur's Lemma, on any irreducible representation, the central elements must act as scalar multiples of the identity. More generally, on any indecomposable representation, the generalized central characters are well-defined. This means that any indecomposable representation $V$ belongs to a \"block\" determined by the scalars $(a, b, c)$ for which $(E^3-a)^N, (F^3-b)^N, (K^3-c)^N$ act as zero for $N \\gg 0$. For simplicity, we can consider the action of the center to be given by a character $\\chi: Z(U_q) \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe category of all finite-dimensional $U_q$-representations, $Rep(U_q)$, decomposes into a direct sum of smaller categories $C_\\chi$ indexed by these central characters $\\chi$. An object is indecomposable in $Rep(U_q)$ if and only if it is an indecomposable object in some $C_\\chi$. The question asks for the proportion of irreducible objects among all indecomposable objects.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the Irreducible Representations\n\nThe classification of finite-dimensional irreducible (or simple) representations of $U_q$ at a root of unity is a classical result.\nLet $l=3$. The irreducible representations fall into two main classes:\n1.  **Highest/Lowest weight representations**: These are analogous to the standard representations of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$. They are characterized by the property that $E^3$ and $F^3$ act as the zero operator. Their dimension $d$ must satisfy $1 \\le d \\le l=3$. For each dimension $d \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, and for each choice of sign $\\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ (determining the eigenvalues of $K$), there is a unique irreducible representation $L_{d, \\epsilon}$. This gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ such representations.\n2.  **Cyclic representations**: These are representations where at least one of $E^3$ or $F^3$ acts non-trivially. They all have dimension equal to $l=3$. There is an infinite family of such representations, parameterized by a 2-dimensional complex manifold.\n\nA crucial and definitive result from the theory is:\n**The dimension of any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of $U_q$ is less than or equal to $l$.**\nIn our case, with $l=3$, any irreducible representation must have dimension 1, 2, or 3.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the Indecomposable Representations\n\nAn irreducible representation is always indecomposable. Thus, there are already infinitely many indecomposable representations of dimension 3. To find all indecomposables, we need to consider non-semisimple representations.\n\nThe structure of the category of indecomposables depends heavily on the central character $\\chi=(a,b,c)$:\n*   **Generic characters**: If $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$, the corresponding block $C_\\chi$ is simple. The algebra $U_q / \\text{ker}(\\chi)$ is isomorphic to the matrix algebra $M_3(\\mathbb{C})$. This algebra has only one indecomposable representation (up to isomorphism), which is the 3-dimensional simple representation. So, for this vast family of characters, all indecomposables are irreducible.\n*   **Singular characters**: If $a=0$ or $b=0$, the situation is much more complex. A particularly important case is $a=b=0$. The algebra is a version of the \"small quantum group\" $u_q$. For $l=3$, this algebra is of **tame representation type**.\n\nTame representation type means that while there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations, they can be classified. For each dimension, the indecomposables fall into a finite number of discrete families and a finite number of one-parameter families.\n\nA key consequence for tame algebras that are not of finite representation type (like the one here) is the following:\n**There exist indecomposable representations of arbitrarily large dimension.**\nFor instance, for the small quantum group, there are \"string modules\" (the preprojective and preinjective modules) whose dimensions are unbounded. Also, there are \"tube\" families of modules $R_k(\\lambda)$ whose dimension is $k \\times l = 3k$ for any integer $k \\ge 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Percentage\n\nWe need to compare the \"number\" of irreducible objects with the \"number\" of all indecomposable objects. Since both sets are infinite, we cannot simply count them. A natural approach is to consider the objects up to a certain dimension $D$ and see what happens as $D$ grows to infinity.\n\nLet $S_{irr}$ be the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible modules and $S_{ind}$ be the set of indecomposable modules.\n*   We established that the dimension of any module in $S_{irr}$ is at most 3.\n*   We established that the dimensions of modules in $S_{ind}$ are not bounded above. For any dimension $D_0$, there exists an indecomposable module $M$ with $\\dim(M) > D_0$.\n\nLet's count the number of isomorphism classes of objects with dimension up to $D$.\n*   Let $C_{irr}(D) = |\\{ [M] \\in S_{irr} \\mid \\dim M \\le D \\}|$.\n*   Let $C_{ind}(D) = |\\{ [M] \\in S_{ind} \\mid \\dim M \\le D \\}|$.\n\nThe percentage of irreducibles among all indecomposables can be interpreted as the limit:\n$$ P = \\lim_{D \\to \\infty} \\frac{C_{irr}(D)}{C_{ind}(D)} $$\n\nLet's analyze the numerator and the denominator.\n*   **Numerator**: Since all irreducible representations have dimension $\\le 3$, for any $D \\ge 3$, the set of irreducibles with dimension $\\le D$ is the same as the set of all irreducibles. So, $C_{irr}(D) = C_{irr}(3)$ for all $D \\ge 3$. While this number is infinite (due to the continuous family of cyclic representations), it is \"fixed\" as $D$ increases beyond 3.\n*   **Denominator**: Since there are indecomposable representations of arbitrarily large dimension, the count $C_{ind}(D)$ continues to grow as $D \\to \\infty$. In fact, it grows quite fast.\n\nTherefore, we are evaluating the limit of a quantity whose numerator becomes constant for $D \\ge 3$ while its denominator grows indefinitely. Such a limit must be zero.\n\n$$ P = \\lim_{D \\to \\infty} \\frac{C_{irr}(3)}{C_{ind}(D)} = 0 $$\n\nThe existence of indecomposable representations of any dimension (in certain families) while irreducible representations are capped at dimension 3 means that as we consider representations of higher and higher dimensions, the proportion of those that are irreducible becomes vanishingly small.\n\nFinal careful points check:\n*   The setup is clear: $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$.\n*   The classification of irreducibles is standard: dimensions are bounded by $l=3$.\n*   The existence of indecomposables of arbitrary dimension is a key feature of the tame representation theory governing the singular blocks.\n*   The method of calculating the percentage by taking a limit over dimension is a standard and robust way to handle such infinite sets of objects.\n\nThe conclusion is that an indecomposable representation chosen \"at random\" from the set of all indecomposable representations is almost certain to be reducible."
