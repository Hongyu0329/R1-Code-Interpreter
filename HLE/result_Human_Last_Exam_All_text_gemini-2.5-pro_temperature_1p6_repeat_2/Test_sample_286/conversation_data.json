    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a sequence of $n=100000$ numbers $a_1, \\dots, a_n \\in [0,1]$.\n    *   We need to find a sequence $x_0, \\dots, x_n$ such that:\n        a) $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n        b) All $x_k$ must lie in the interval $I_M = [-1+10^{-M}, 1-10^{-M}]$.\n    *   The crucial part is that this must be possible for *any* choice of the sequence $\\{a_i\\}$.\n    *   We need to find the smallest positive integer $M$ that guarantees this.\n\n2.  **Translate the Conditions into a More Tractable Form:**\n    *   The condition $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ means that $x_i = x_{i-1} \\pm a_i$. We can choose the sign at each step.\n    *   This implies that any $x_k$ can be written in terms of the starting point $x_0$ and the sequence $\\{a_i\\}$:\n        $x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i a_i$, where each $\\sigma_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\n    *   Let's define the partial sums $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i a_i$, with $S_0=0$. So, $x_k = x_0 + S_k$.\n    *   The condition that all $x_k \\in I_M$ for $k=0, \\dots, n$ means:\n        $-1+10^{-M} \\le x_0 + S_k \\le 1-10^{-M}$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n    *   For a *fixed* choice of signs $\\{\\sigma_i\\}$, this is equivalent to:\n        $\\max_{0 \\le k \\le n} (x_0 + S_k) \\le 1-10^{-M}$\n        $\\min_{0 \\le k \\le n} (x_0 + S_k) \\ge -1+10^{-M}$\n    *   Let $m = \\min_{0 \\le k \\le n} S_k$ and $M' = \\max_{0 \\le k \\le n} S_k$. The inequalities become:\n        $x_0 \\le 1-10^{-M} - M'$\n        $x_0 \\ge -1+10^{-M} - m$\n    *   A value for $x_0$ exists if and only if the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound:\n        $-1+10^{-M} - m \\le 1-10^{-M} - M'$\n    *   Rearranging this gives:\n        $M' - m \\le (1-10^{-M}) - (-1+10^{-M}) = 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n    *   The term $M' - m$ is the range of the partial sums. Let's call it $R(\\{\\sigma_i\\}) = \\max_k S_k - \\min_k S_k$.\n\n3.  **Reformulate the Core Problem:**\n    The problem states that for *any* sequence $\\{a_i\\}$, *there exist* $x_0, \\dots, x_n$ satisfying the property. This means that for any $\\{a_i\\}$, we must be able to choose the signs $\\{\\sigma_i\\}$ (which in turn determines the path of partial sums) such that the range of these sums allows for an appropriate $x_0$.\n    So, for any $\\{a_i\\}$, we need to ensure that $\\min_{\\{\\sigma_i\\}} R(\\{\\sigma_i\\}) \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n    To find the smallest $M$ that works for *all* $\\{a_i\\}$, we must consider the worst-case scenario for $\\{a_i\\}$, i.e., the one that makes the minimum range as large as possible. Let this maximum possible minimal range be $L_{max}$:\n    $L_{max} = \\sup_{\\{a_i\\} \\in [0,1]^n} \\left( \\min_{\\{\\sigma_i\\} \\in \\{-1,1\\}^n} \\left( \\max_{0 \\le k \\le n} S_k - \\min_{0 \\le k \\le n} S_k \\right) \\right)$.\n    The condition on $M$ becomes $L_{max} \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n\n4.  **Find the Value of $L_{max}$:**\n    This quantity, $L_{max}$, is a known result in discrepancy theory. A result by Grinberg and Sevastyanov (1980) gives its precise value. For a sequence of length $n$, the value is:\n    $L_{max} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2^k}$, where $k = \\lfloor \\log_2(n+1) \\rfloor$.\n\n5.  **Calculate $L_{max}$ for our Specific Case:**\n    *   We have $n = 100000$.\n    *   So, $n+1 = 100001$.\n    *   We need to find $k = \\lfloor \\log_2(100001) \\rfloor$.\n    *   Let's find the powers of 2 around 100001:\n        $2^{10} = 1024$\n        $2^{16} = 2^6 \\cdot 2^{10} = 64 \\cdot 1024 = 65536$.\n        $2^{17} = 2 \\cdot 2^{16} = 2 \\cdot 65536 = 131072$.\n    *   Since $65536 \\le 100001 < 131072$, we have $16 \\le \\log_2(100001) < 17$.\n    *   Therefore, $k = \\lfloor \\log_2(100001) \\rfloor = 16$.\n    *   Now, we can find $L_{max}$:\n        $L_{max} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{16}} = 2 - \\frac{1}{65536}$.\n\n6.  **Solve for M:**\n    *   We substitute the value of $L_{max}$ back into our inequality:\n        $2 - \\frac{1}{2^{16}} \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n    *   Subtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n        $-\\frac{1}{2^{16}} \\le -2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n    *   Multiplying by -1 reverses the inequality sign:\n        $\\frac{1}{2^{16}} \\ge 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n    *   Rearrange to solve for $M$:\n        $\\frac{1}{2^{16}} \\ge \\frac{2}{10^M}$\n        $10^M \\ge 2 \\cdot 2^{16}$\n        $10^M \\ge 2^{17}$.\n    *   We have already calculated $2^{17} = 131072$.\n        $10^M \\ge 131072$.\n    *   We need to find the smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies this. Let's test integer values for $M$:\n        -   If $M=1, 10^1 = 10 < 131072$.\n        -   If $M=2, 10^2 = 100 < 131072$.\n        -   If $M=3, 10^3 = 1000 < 131072$.\n        -   If $M=4, 10^4 = 10000 < 131072$.\n        -   If $M=5, 10^5 = 100000 < 131072$.\n        -   If $M=6, 10^6 = 1000000 \\ge 131072$.\n    *   The smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies the condition is 6.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
