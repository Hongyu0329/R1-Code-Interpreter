    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Question**\n\n*   **System:** A particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, commonly known as a \"particle in a box\".\n*   **Box size:** The box has a length of `a`, extending from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the first excited state, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Interval of Interest:** We need to find the probability of the particle being located in the small interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the probability `P`.\n\n**2. Recall the Fundamental Principles**\n\nThe probability `P` of finding a particle in a specific region is given by integrating the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that region.\nThe formula is:\n`P = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψ_n(x)|² dx`\n\nThe normalized wavefunction `ψ_n(x)` for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is:\n`ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n\n**3. List the Careful Points**\n\n*   **Node at the Center:** For the `n=2` state, the wavefunction is `ψ₂(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`. This wavefunction has a node (a point where the function is zero) at `x = a/2`, because `sin(2π(a/2) / a) = sin(π) = 0`.\n*   **Interval Centered on the Node:** The given interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered precisely at this node (`x = 0.5a`).\n*   **Invalid Simple Approximation:** A common quick approximation for a small interval `Δx` is `P ≈ |ψ(x_mid)|² * Δx`. In this case, `x_mid = 0.5a` and `|ψ₂(0.5a)|² = 0`. This approximation would incorrectly yield a probability of zero. We must perform a more careful calculation because the probability is small, but not exactly zero.\n*   **Small Interval Justification:** The interval width `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a` is very small compared to the box length `a`. This justifies using a Taylor series approximation for the integrand, which simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 4.1: Set up the probability integral.**\n\nFirst, find the probability density `|ψ₂(x)|²`:\n`|ψ₂(x)|² = (sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\nNow, set up the integral for the probability `P`:\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**Step 4.2: Simplify the integral using an approximation.**\n\nBecause the interval is small and centered at the node `x=a/2`, it is convenient to change variables. Let `u = x - a/2`.\n*   When `x = 0.495a`, `u = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a`.\n*   When `x = 0.505a`, `u = 0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a`.\n*   `x = u + a/2`, and `dx = du`.\n\nSubstitute this into the integrand:\n`sin²(2πx / a) = sin²(2π(u + a/2) / a) = sin²(2πu/a + π)`\nUsing the identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we get:\n`sin²(2πu/a + π) = [-sin(2πu/a)]² = sin²(2πu/a)`\n\nThe integral becomes:\n`P = ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πu/a) du`\n\n**Step 4.3: Apply the small-angle approximation.**\n\nInside the integration interval, the argument of the sine function, `θ = 2πu/a`, is very small. Its maximum absolute value is `|2π(-0.005a)/a| = 0.01π ≈ 0.0314` radians. For such small angles, we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\nTherefore:\n`sin²(2πu/a) ≈ (2πu/a)² = 4π²u² / a²`\n\nSubstitute this approximation back into the integral:\n`P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²u² / a²) du`\n`P ≈ (8π² / a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] u² du`\n\n**Step 4.4: Evaluate the final integral.**\n\nThe integral of `u²` is `u³/3`.\n`P ≈ (8π² / a³) * [u³/3]` (evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`)\n`P ≈ (8π² / a³) * [ (0.005a)³/3 - (-0.005a)³/3 ]`\n`P ≈ (8π² / a³) * [ 2 * (0.005a)³ / 3 ]`\n`P ≈ (16π² / (3a³)) * (0.005)³ * a³`\n\nThe `a³` terms cancel out:\n`P ≈ (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³`\n`P ≈ (16π² / 3) * (1.25 × 10⁻⁷)`\n`P ≈ (20π² / 3) × 10⁻⁷`\n\n**Step 4.5: Calculate the final numerical value.**\n\nUsing the value `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n`P ≈ (20 * 9.8696 / 3) × 10⁻⁷`\n`P ≈ (197.392 / 3) × 10⁻⁷`\n`P ≈ 65.797 × 10⁻⁷`\n`P ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁶`\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final calculated probability is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
