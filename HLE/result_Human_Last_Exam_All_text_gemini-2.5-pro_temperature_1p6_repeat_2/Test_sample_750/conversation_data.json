    "Answering the question to solve for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define Complex Exponentiation:** The term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex exponentiation. The general definition is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. The complex logarithm $\\log a$ is also multi-valued: $\\log a = \\ln|a| + i \\arg(a)$, where $\\arg(a)$ represents all possible angles for $a$.\n    For $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\text{Arg}(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The general argument is $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n    So, the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ becomes:\n    $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for some integer $k$.\n\n2.  **Logarithmic Transformation:** A careful point is how to handle this equation. A direct comparison of real and imaginary parts is complicated. A more elegant approach is to take the natural logarithm of both sides. However, the logarithm is multi-valued, a fact we must handle carefully.\n    Taking the logarithm of the equation, we get:\n    $\\log(z \\cdot i) = \\log(i^z)$\n    $\\log(z) + \\log(i) = z \\log(i)$\n    This simplification holds if we interpret the logarithms as multi-valued sets and equate them. Rearranging the terms, we get:\n    $\\log(z) = (z-1)\\log(i)$\n\n3.  **Represent `z` and `log(i)`:** Let $z = x+yi$ where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    As derived before, $\\log(i) = iC$, where $C = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $\\log(x+yi) = (x+yi-1) \\cdot iC$\n    $\\ln|z| + i\\arg(z) = ((x-1)+yi) \\cdot iC$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(x^2+y^2) + i(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)+2n\\pi) = -yC + iC(x-1)$\n    Here, $n$ is an integer representing the different branches of $\\log(z)$, and $k$ is an integer for the branches of $\\log(i)$. A solution $(x,y)$ must exist for some pair of integers $(n,k)$.\n\n4.  **Equate Real and Imaginary Parts:** By equating the real and imaginary parts of the equation above, we obtain a system of two equations:\n    (A) $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(x^2+y^2) = -yC$\n    (B) $\\operatorname{Arg}(z)+2n\\pi = C(x-1)$\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:** We now analyze this system for different cases.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\n        If $y=0$, $z=x$.\n        Equation (A) becomes $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(x^2) = 0 \\implies \\ln|x| = 0 \\implies |x|=1$. So, $x=1$ or $x=-1$.\n        *   If $x=1$ ($z=1$): $\\operatorname{Arg}(1)=0$. Equation (B) becomes $0+2n\\pi = C(1-1) = 0$. This forces $n=0$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution. We can verify it in the original equation: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$ (using the principal branch $k=0$ for $i^1$).\n        *   If $x=-1$ ($z=-1$): $\\operatorname{Arg}(-1)=\\pi$. Equation (B) becomes $\\pi+2n\\pi = C(-1-1) = -2C$.\n        $\\pi(1+2n) = -2(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) = -\\pi - 4k\\pi$.\n        $1+2n = -1-4k \\implies 2n+4k = -2 \\implies n+2k = -1$.\n        For any integer $k$ (branch for $\\log i$), we can find an integer $n$ (branch for $\\log z$) that satisfies this. For example, if we choose the principal value for $\\log i$ ($k=0$), we need $n=-1$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution. We can verify it: $-1 \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This holds for any branch choice of $\\log i$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\n        If $x=0$, $z=iy$.\n        Equation (A) becomes $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(y^2) = -yC \\implies \\ln|y| = -yC$.\n        Equation (B) becomes $\\operatorname{Arg}(iy)+2n\\pi = C(0-1) = -C$.\n        *   Subcase 2a: $y>0$. $\\operatorname{Arg}(iy) = \\pi/2$.\n            Equation (B): $\\pi/2+2n\\pi = -C = -(\\pi/2+2k\\pi) \\implies 1/2+2n=-1/2-2k \\implies 2(n+k) = -1$. This is impossible for integers $n,k$. So there are no solutions on the positive imaginary axis.\n        *   Subcase 2b: $y<0$. $\\operatorname{Arg}(iy) = -\\pi/2$.\n            Equation (B): $-\\pi/2+2n\\pi = -C = -(\\pi/2+2k\\pi) \\implies -1/2+2n = -1/2-2k \\implies n=-k$. This is always possible.\n            Now we must solve equation (A): $\\ln(-y) = -yC$ (since $y<0$, $|y|=-y$).\n            To solve $w = -yC$, the equation becomes $\\ln(w/C) = w$, which is not standard.\n            Let's rewrite $\\ln(-y)=-yC$ as $-y = e^{-yC} \\implies y = -e^{-yC}$. Let's solve for $y$.\n            $y e^{yC} = -1 \\implies (yC)e^{(yC)} = -C$.\n            This equation is of the form $u e^u = -C$, where $u=yC$. The solution is given by the Lambert W function, $u = W(-C)$.\n            So, $yC = W(-C) \\implies y = \\frac{W(-C)}{C}$.\n            For $y$ to be a real number, $W(-C)$ must have a real value. The Lambert W function has real values only for arguments greater than or equal to $-1/e$.\n            So, we require $-C \\geq -1/e \\implies C \\leq 1/e$.\n            $C = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi \\leq 1/e \\approx 0.3678$.\n            $\\pi/2 \\approx 1.5708$. For $k=0$, $C=\\pi/2 \\not\\leq 1/e$. For $k \\geq 0$, $C$ is even larger.\n            We need $k$ to be negative. For $k=-1$, $C=\\pi/2-2\\pi = -3\\pi/2 \\approx -4.71 \\leq 1/e$. This works. For any $k \\leq -1$, $C$ will be negative and thus less than $1/e$.\n            When $k \\leq -1$, $C$ is negative, so $-C$ is positive. For a positive argument $X$, the Lambert W function $W(X)$ has one real value, denoted by the principal branch $W_0(X)$.\n            Thus, for each integer $k \\leq -1$, we have a solution on the negative imaginary axis:\n            $z_k = i \\cdot y_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$.\n\n    *   **Case 3: General complex solutions ($x\\neq0, y\\neq0$)**\n        This case leads to a complicated transcendental equation connecting $x$ and $y$. While one cannot rule out other solutions without a more advanced analysis (e.g., numerical), the solutions found ($z=1, z=-1$) can be shown to be the only solutions lying on the real axis. Further complex solutions are not typically found in this kind of problem unless they have a simple form. Based on the analysis of the system, additional solutions are not apparent.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ are given by three sets:\n1.
