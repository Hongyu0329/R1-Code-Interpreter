    "Answering this question involves determining the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 that have exactly 3 inversions. Let's denote this number by \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the notation**:\n    *   A permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of length \\(n\\) is a reordering of the set \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\).\n    *   An inversion in \\(\\sigma = \\sigma_1\\sigma_2...\\sigma_n\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\sigma_i > \\sigma_j\\).\n    *   A permutation \\(\\sigma\\) avoids a pattern \\(\\pi\\) (e.g., 1324) if no subsequence of \\(\\sigma\\) has the same relative order as \\(\\pi\\). For \\(\\pi=1324\\), this means there are no indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\sigma_i < \\sigma_k < \\sigma_j < \\sigma_l\\).\n    *   \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\) is the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) that avoid pattern \\(\\pi\\) and have exactly \\(k\\) inversions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the constraints**:\n    *   The length of the permutation is \\(n = 333\\), which is a large number.\n    *   The number of inversions is \\(k = 3\\), which is a very small number.\n\n3.  **Properties of permutations with few inversions**:\n    *   A permutation with 0 inversions is the identity permutation \\((1, 2, ..., n)\\).\n    *   A permutation with a small number of inversions is \"close\" to the identity permutation. This means most elements are fixed points (i.e., \\(\\sigma_i = i\\)), and the elements that are not fixed points (\\(\\sigma_i \\ne i\\)) are few and not far from their original positions.\n    *   The structure of such permutations can be described by their \"active\" block. Most permutations with few inversions can be written in the form \\(\\sigma = id_{i-1} \\oplus \\pi' \\oplus id_{n-i-m+1}\\). Here, \\(id_j\\) is the identity permutation of length \\(j\\), \\(\\oplus\\) denotes the direct sum of permutations (e.g., \\(\\alpha \\oplus \\beta = \\alpha_1 ... \\alpha_k (\\beta_1+k) ... (\\beta_l+k)\\)), and \\(\\pi'\\) is a permutation of length \\(m\\) acting on the values \\(\\{i, ..., i+m-1\\}\\). The total number of inversions in \\(\\sigma\\) is equal to the number of inversions in \\(\\pi'\\).\n\n4.  **Pattern avoidance in block-decomposable permutations**:\n    *   Let's analyze when a permutation of the form \\(\\sigma = id_{i-1} \\oplus \\pi' \\oplus id_{j}\\) (where \\(j=n-(i+m-1)\\)) avoids the pattern 1324.\n    *   A 1324 pattern is formed by indices \\(a < b < c < d\\) with \\(\\sigma_a < \\sigma_c < \\sigma_b < \\sigma_d\\).\n    *   Consider the case where the active block \\(\\pi'\\) is in the middle, i.e., \\(i > 1\\) and \\(j > 0\\). Let's assume \\(\\pi'\\) has at least one inversion.\n    *   Let \\(\\sigma_b > \\sigma_c\\) be an inversion within the \\(\\pi'\\) block, with \\(i \\le b < c < i+m\\).\n    *   Since \\(i>1\\), we can choose an index \\(a=1\\). Then \\(\\sigma_a = \\sigma_1 = 1\\). The value \\(\\sigma_c\\) belongs to the block \\(\\pi'\\), so its value is at least \\(i > 1\\). Thus, \\(\\sigma_a < \\sigma_c\\).\n    *   Since \\(j>0\\), which means \\(i+m-1 < n\\), we can choose an index \\(d=n\\). Then \\(\\sigma_d = \\sigma_n = n\\). The value \\(\\sigma_b\\) belongs to the block \\(\\pi'\\), so its value is at most \\(i+m-1 < n\\). Thus, \\(\\sigma_b < \\sigma_d\\).\n    *   Putting it together, for any inversion \\(\\sigma_b > \\sigma_c\\) in the middle block \\(\\pi'\\), we can choose \\(a=1\\) and \\(d=n\\) to form the subsequence \\(\\sigma_a, \\sigma_b, \\sigma_c, \\sigma_d\\). The values are \\(1, \\sigma_b, \\sigma_c, n\\). Let's check the order: \\(\\sigma_a < \\sigma_c < \\sigma_b < \\sigma_d\\). This holds because \\(1 < \\sigma_c < \\sigma_b < n\\).\n    *   This construction creates a 1324 pattern. Therefore, for a permutation with few inversions to be 1324-avoiding, its active block \\(\\pi'\\) cannot be in the middle. It must be at the beginning or at the end.\n\n5.  **Counting the allowed permutations**:\n    This leaves two cases for 1324-avoiding permutations with \\(k=3\\) and large \\(n\\):\n    *   **Case 1**: The active block is at the beginning: \\(\\sigma = \\pi' \\oplus id_{n-m}\\).\n    *   **Case 2**: The active block is at the end: \\(\\sigma = id_{n-m} \\oplus \\pi'\\).\n\n    Let's analyze these two cases.\n    *   **Analysis of Case 1 (\\(\\sigma = \\pi' \\oplus id_{n-m}\\))**: Such a permutation contains a 1324 pattern if and only if \\(\\pi'\\) contains either a 1324 pattern or a 132 pattern. (The argument for the 132 subcase: if \\(\\pi'_{i_1} < \\pi'_{i_3} < \\pi'_{i_2}\\) for \\(i_1<i_2<i_3\\), pick \\(i_4 > m\\). Then \\(\\sigma_{i_4} = i_4 > m \\ge \\pi'_{i_2}\\). The indices \\(i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4\\) and corresponding values form a 1324 pattern).\n        So, for \\(\\sigma\\) to be 1324-avoiding, \\(\\pi'\\) must be 132-avoiding (and 1324-avoiding, which is true for small \\(m\\)). We need to count the number of 132-avoiding permutations \\(\\pi'\\) with 3 inversions. The number of 132-avoiding permutations of length \\(m\\) with \\(k\\) inversions is equal to the number of partitions of \\(k\\) into at most \\(m-1\\) parts. For \\(k=3\\) and \\(m \\ge 4\\), this is simply the number of partitions of 3, denoted \\(p(3)\\).\n        The partitions of 3 are:\n        *   3\n        *   2 + 1\n        *   1 + 1 + 1\n        Thus, there are \\(p(3) = 3\\) such permutations \\(\\pi'\\). This count is independent of the size \\(m\\) of the block, as long as \\(m\\) is large enough (\\(m \\ge k+1=4\\)). These 3 permutations form the start of a permutation of length 333, and are distinct.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Case 2 (\\(\\sigma = id_{n-m} \\oplus \\pi'\\))**: By similar logic, such a permutation contains a 1324 pattern if and only if \\(\\pi'\\) contains a 1324 or 213 pattern.\n        So, for \\(\\sigma\\) to be 1324-avoiding, \\(\\pi'\\) must be 213-avoiding. The number of 213-avoiding permutations with \\(k\\) inversions is known to be the same as for 132-avoiding permutations. So, there are also \\(p(3) = 3\\) such permutations \\(\\pi'\\) with 3 inversions. These 3 permutations form the end of a permutation of length 333.\n\n6.  **Final count**:\n    *   We have 3 permutations from Case 1, where the inversions are all located at the beginning of the sequence. For \\(n=333\\), an example is \\((3,2,1,4,5,...,333)\\).\n    *   We have 3 permutations from Case 2, where the inversions are all located at the end of the sequence. For \\(n=333\\), an example is \\((1,2,...,330,333,332,331)\\).\n    *   For \\(n=333\\), these two sets of permutations are disjoint. A permutation in Case 1 has its first few elements out of order while the tail is ordered. A permutation in Case 2 has its first many elements in order. They cannot be the same.\n    *   Other cases, such as permutations with inversions at both the beginning and the end, or indecomposable permutations, can be shown to contain the 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\). For example, \\(\\sigma = (2,1) \\oplus id_{n-4} \\oplus (2,1)\\) has 2 inversions, but \\((2,1) \\oplus id_{n-5} \\oplus (3,1,2)_{\\text{rel}}\\) has 3 inversions and contains a 1324 pattern.\n\n    The total number of such permutations is the sum of the counts from the two disjoint cases.\n    Total number = (Number from Case 1) + (Number from Case 2) = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions, \\(av_n^k(1324)\\), for large n and small k, is determined by permutations whose inversions are concentrated at either the beginning or the end.\n\n1.  **Permutations with inversions at the beginning**: These are of the form \\(\\sigma = \\pi \\oplus id_{n-m}\\), where \\(\\pi\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\) with \\(k=3\\) inversions. For \\(\\sigma\\) to be 1324-avoiding, \\(\\pi\\) must be 132-avoiding. The number of 132-avoiding permutations with \\(k\\) inversions is given by the number of partitions of \\(k\\). For \\(k=3\\), the number of partitions is \\(p(3)=3\\).\n\n2.  **Permutations with inversions at the end**: These are of the form \\(\\sigma = id_{n-m} \\oplus \\pi\\). For \\(\\sigma\\) to be 1324-avoiding, \\(\\pi\\) must be 213-avoiding. The number of 213-avoiding permutations with \\(k\\) inversions is also the number of partitions of \\(k\\). For \\(k=3\\), this is \\(p(3)=3\\).\n\n3.  **Other cases**: Permutations with inversions in the middle, or distributed in multiple disjoint blocks, can be shown to contain the 1324 pattern for a large length like \\(n=333\\).\n\nFor \\(n=333\\), the two sets of permutations are disjoint. Therefore, the total number of such permutations is the sum of the numbers from the two cases.\n\nTotal = \\(p(3) + p(3) = 3 + 3 = 6\\)."
