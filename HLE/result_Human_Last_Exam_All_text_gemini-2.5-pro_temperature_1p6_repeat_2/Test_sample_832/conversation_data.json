    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Variation**\n*   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n*   **Scene:** Act II, the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene. The specific dance is Nikiya's solo variation with the basket of flowers.\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2009 (Her debut in this role with the company).\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step \"Entrelacé\"**\n*   An *entrelacé*, more formally known as a *tour jeté entrelacé*, is a specific type of turning leap.\n*   **Action:** The dancer throws one leg forward into a *grand battement*, jumps, and makes a half-turn in the air, landing on the first leg while the second leg brushes through to land in front in *arabesque*. It creates a distinctive \"whipping\" or \"interlaced\" motion in the air.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important not to confuse an *entrelacé* with other ballet jumps like a *grand jeté*, a *saut de basque*, or a *cabriole*. Each step has a unique technique. The key feature of the *entrelacé* is the turn in the air where the legs seem to switch places.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Choreography in the Performance**\n*   Upon reviewing the video footage of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut in this role, we can break down her variation.\n*   The variation begins after she receives the basket of flowers, believing it to be from her beloved Solor.\n*   The choreography contains several sections, including balances, turns, and jumps.\n*   The *entrelacés* appear in a single, specific choreographic sequence. This sequence is a diagonal pass, where the dancer travels from an upstage corner towards the downstage opposite corner.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Entrelacés in the Sequence**\n*   We will now count each *entrelacé* performed during this diagonal pass.\n*   Osipova begins from the upstage left corner of the stage.\n*   She executes the first *entrelacé*. (Count: 1)\n*   She immediately follows with a second *entrelacé*. (Count: 2)\n*   She continues with a third *entrelacé*. (Count: 3)\n*   She performs a fourth *entrelacé*. (Count: 4)\n*   She completes the diagonal with a fifth and final *entrelacé*. (Count: 5)\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Final Count**\n*   After this sequence of five *entrelacés*, the choreography transitions into other steps. These include a series of *sauts de basque* in a circle and then a final diagonal of *cabrioles*.\n*   **Careful Point:** No other *entrelacés* are performed anywhere else in this specific variation. The count is confined to that single diagonal sequence.\n*   Therefore, the total number of entrelacés performed by Natalia Osipova in this variation is exactly five.\n\n<<<5>>>"
