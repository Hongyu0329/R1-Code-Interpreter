No. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Gödel's ontological proof operate in fundamentally different and incompatible domains (physical reality vs. abstract metaphysics). The core concepts of Gödel's proof, such as "positive property" and "logical necessity," have no meaningful equivalent or representation within the mathematics of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators, etc.). Therefore, it is not possible to use the tools of one to prove statements in the other.
