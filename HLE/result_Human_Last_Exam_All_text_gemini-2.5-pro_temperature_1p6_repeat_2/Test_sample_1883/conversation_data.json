    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction**\nThe starting material is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. Under thermal conditions, it produces two isomeric products, A (*cis*) and B (*trans*). The starting material is a conjugated polyene, and the products are described as stereoisomers of a cyclic compound. This indicates an **electrocyclic reaction**. The reacting system is an octatetraene (from C2 to C9), which has 8 π-electrons. Upon cyclization, it will form a substituted cyclooctatriene, specifically 7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene. The new stereocenters are at C7 and C8.\n\n**2. Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory / Woodward-Hoffmann Rules**\n*   **π-electron count:** The reacting system is an octatetraene, which has 8 π-electrons. This is a 4k system, where k=2.\n*   **Reaction condition:** The reaction is conducted under thermal conditions.\n*   **Selection Rule:** For a 4k π-electron system undergoing a thermal electrocyclic reaction, the rule is **conrotatory** ring closure. This can be derived from the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which is ψ₄ for an octatetraene. The HOMO is antisymmetric with respect to a C₂ axis, meaning the p-orbitals at the termini have opposite phases. To achieve constructive overlap for bond formation, the termini must rotate in the same direction (conrotation).\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Starting Material and Transition States**\nThe stereochemical outcome depends on the geometry of the starting material and the conrotatory motion.\n*   The termini of the reacting π-system are C2 and C9.\n*   At C2, the double bond has a (Z) configuration. The methyl group is cis to the main chain (C4). In the coiled conformation needed for cyclization, this methyl group points \"inward\" toward the center of the coil. We denote this as `Me(in)`.\n*   At C9, the double bond has an (E) configuration. The methyl group (C10) is trans to the main chain (C7). In the coiled conformation, this methyl group points \"outward\" away from the coil. We denote this as `Me(out)`.\n\nA direct conrotatory cyclization of this `(Me(in), Me(out))` substrate leads exclusively to the *trans*-isomer (B), regardless of which conrotatory direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) is chosen. This contradicts the problem statement that a *cis*-isomer (A) is also formed.\n\n**4. The Curtin-Hammett Principle**\nThe formation of both *cis* and *trans* products implies that the starting material can access two different transition states, one leading to A and one to B. Since the given \\((8E)\\)-isomer can only form the *trans*-product B directly, the *cis*-product A must arise from a different starting isomer. This suggests that under the thermal conditions, the initial \\((8E)\\)-isomer is in rapid equilibrium with its \\((8Z)\\)-isomer.\n`SM(E) <=> SM(Z)`\n*   `SM(E)` is the starting \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n*   `SM(Z)` is the isomerized \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n\nAccording to the Curtin-Hammett principle, if this equilibrium is rapid compared to the rate of cyclization, the ratio of products A/B will not depend on the equilibrium constant between SM(E) and SM(Z), but only on the difference in the free energies of the transition states leading to A and B.\n`Ratio A/B = exp(-(ΔG‡_A - ΔG‡_B)/RT)`\nwhere `ΔG‡_A` and `ΔG‡_B` are the activation free energies for the formation of A and B, respectively.\n\n**5. Comparing Transition State Energies (Torquoselectivity)**\nWe must compare the energy of the transition state for the cyclization of SM(Z) (`TS_A`) with that for the cyclization of SM(E) (`TS_B`). This is a question of **torquoselectivity**—the preference for one direction of conrotation over the other, which is primarily dictated by steric factors.\n\n*   **Formation of A (cis-isomer) from SM(Z):**\n    *   SM(Z) has `Me(in)` at C2 and `Me(in)` at C9.\n    *   Conrotatory closure leads to the *cis*-product A.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, both bulky methyl groups will preferentially rotate \"outward\" (away from the forming ring).\n    *   The transition state `TS_A` therefore involves two `Me(in) -> outward` rotations. Each rotation causes a steric clash between the methyl group and the adjacent vinyl hydrogen (an `A(1,3)`-strain interaction). Let's call the energy of this clash `X`.\n    *   Total steric cost for `TS_A` ≈ `2X`.\n\n*   **Formation of B (trans-isomer) from SM(E):**\n    *   SM(E) has `Me(in)` at C2 and `Me(out)` at C9.\n    *   Conrotatory closure leads to the *trans*-product B.\n    *   The preferred pathway will involve the more sterically hindered `Me(in)` group rotating outward, forcing the less hindered `Me(out)` group to rotate inward.\n    *   The transition state `TS_B` involves one `Me(in) -> outward` rotation (clash `X`) and one `Me(out) -> inward` rotation. The inward rotation causes a clash with the atoms across the forming ring (a transannular interaction). Let's call the energy of this clash `Y`.\n    *   Total steric cost for `TS_B` ≈ `X + Y`.\n\n**6. Predicting the Ratio A/B**\nThe ratio of products depends on the relative energies of the two transition states.\n`ΔG‡_A - ΔG‡_B ≈ E(TS_A) - E(TS_B) ≈ 2X - (X+Y) = X - Y`\nThe final ratio depends on the relative magnitudes of the `A(1,3)` steric clash (`X`) and the transannular steric clash (`Y`).\n*   `X` is the interaction between a methyl group and a vinyl hydrogen, separated by two bonds (`Me-C=C-H`). This is a well-known and significant steric interaction.\n*   `Y` is the interaction between a methyl group and hydrogens on the backbone of the polyene, which are further away (e.g., 5-6 bonds away).\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the more proximate `A(1,3)` strain is more severe than the transannular strain. Therefore, `X > Y`.\nIf `X > Y`, then `X - Y > 0`. This means `ΔG‡_A > ΔG‡_B`.\nThe transition state leading to the *cis*-product A is higher in energy than the one leading to the *trans*-product B.\nTherefore, the formation of the **trans-product B will be faster**, and B will be the major product.\n\nThe ratio will be `A/B < 1`. To estimate the ratio, we can consider typical energy differences. A small difference of `X - Y` of about 0.8 kcal/mol would lead to a ratio of roughly 1:3 at typical reaction temperatures (e.g., ~100 °C). This is a common type of stereoselectivity found in such problems.\n\nFinal prediction: A/B = 1/3.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{1:3}}$."
