    "This question requires understanding both critical-level views in population ethics and the specific conditions of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define Critical-Level Views:**\n    A critical-level view is a theory about how to rank populations of different sizes and welfare levels. Its core idea is that there exists a \"critical level\" of well-being, let's call it `c`.\n    *   Adding a new person to the world with a welfare level `w` > `c` makes the world better.\n    *   Adding a new person with a welfare level `w` < `c` makes the world worse.\n    *   Adding a new person with a welfare level `w` = `c` leaves the value of the world unchanged.\n    For this view to be distinct from Total Utilitarianism and to create the paradoxes Arrhenius explores, we assume the critical level `c` is positive (`c` > 0). This means there can be lives that are worth living (welfare > 0) but are still below the critical level (`w` < `c`).\n\n2.  **Define the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem:**\n    This theorem states that no single population axiology can satisfy all of the following seemingly plausible conditions:\n\n    *   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** A principle that combines the Pareto principle with a preference for equality. If population A is at least as good as population B for everyone, better for at least one person, and is not more unequal, then A is better than B. Critical-level views generally satisfy this.\n\n    *   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** For any high level of welfare `u`, there's a large enough number of people `N` at a slightly lower (but still positive) welfare level `v` that is considered at least as good. This ensures that a single person's ultra-high welfare doesn't lexically dominate any number of slightly less well-off people. Critical-level views can satisfy this by choosing `v` to be above the critical level `c`.\n\n    *   **C. Non-Elitism:** The crucial condition for this question. It states that there can be no \"elite\" population (e.g., a population of very happy people) that is so good that adding more people with *any* positive level of welfare would make the world worse. It insists that adding a sufficient number of people with lives worth living (welfare > 0) should be considered an improvement.\n\n    *   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** An equally distributed population with positive welfare is better than an equally distributed population of the same size with negative welfare. This is a very minimal and uncontroversial condition that critical-level views easily satisfy.\n\n    *   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** For any population, it is possible to make the world better by adding one more person, provided that person's welfare is high enough. Critical-level views satisfy this: as long as you add someone with welfare `w` > `c`, the world gets better.\n\n3.  **Identify the Violation:**\n    Let's focus on the **Non-Elitism** condition and how it conflicts with a critical-level view (where `c` > 0).\n\n    *   The Non-Elitism condition demands that adding people with *any* positive welfare level (any `w` > 0) can be a good thing.\n    *   The critical-level view claims that if we pick a welfare level `w` that is positive but *below the critical level* (i.e., 0 < `w` < `c`), adding any number of people with this welfare level makes the world *worse*. The value added by each person is (`w` - `c`), which is a negative number.\n\n    This is a direct contradiction. The critical-level view is \"elitist\" in the precise sense that this condition is designed to prohibit: it allows for a situation where adding people with genuinely positive lives (lives worth living) is judged to be a bad thing because their quality of life isn't high enough to meet the critical-level standard. Therefore, critical-level views violate Non-Elitism.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy setting a positive critical level (`c` > 0), critical-level views create a category of lives that are worth living (`w` > 0) but whose addition is considered bad (`w` < `c`). This directly violates the Non-Elitism condition, which posits that adding people with *any* life worth living should be a potential improvement.\n\n<<<C>>>"
