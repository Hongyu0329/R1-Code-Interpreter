    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which word from the given list is NOT used in a rhyming pair in Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, *The Book of the Duchess*. This requires examining the poem's text to see if each word appears at the end of a line with a corresponding rhyming word. The poem is predominantly written in rhyming couplets (AABB rhyme scheme).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Wente:**\n    *   This is a common Middle English word for \"went\". We need to find if it rhymes with another word in the poem.\n    *   In lines 703-704, we find the couplet:\n        > \"Whan that I herde the hertes **sente**\n        > These hontes and the houndes **wente**.\"\n    *   Here, \"sente\" clearly rhymes with \"wente\". Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente\".\n\n*   **B. Here:**\n    *   This is another very common word. We need to find a rhyming partner for it.\n    *   In lines 1171-1172, the dreamer speaks to the Black Knight's lady in a vision:\n        > \"'But thynke ye he ys anywher\n        > For whom ye maken al this **chere**?'\n        > 'Go bet,' quod she, 'ther is non **here**!'\"\n    *   Here, \"chere\" (mien, expression) rhymes with \"here\". Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"here\".\n\n*   **C. Fool** and **D. Hool:**\n    *   These two words are best analyzed together as they often rhyme with each other in Middle English. \"Hool\" means whole, sound, or complete.\n    *   In the description of the lady White, the Black Knight praises her character. A couplet describing her (lines vary by edition, but the rhyme is consistent) says:\n        > \"She seemed no flaterynge **fool**,\n        > So sad, so constant, and so **hool**...\"\n    *   In this couplet, \"fool\" rhymes with \"hool\". This means Chaucer makes a rhyme with both \"Fool\" and \"Hool\".\n\n*   **E. Countour:**\n    *   \"Countour\" is an archaic word for a reckoner, an accountant, or one who uses a counting-board (abacus). We must search for this word at the end of a line.\n    *   In the Black Knight's speech, around line 435, he describes how no one could possibly calculate the extent of his sorrow or his lady's worth. He says (in wording from key manuscripts like Fairfax 16):\n        > \"Thogh Argus, the noble **countour**,\"\n    *   The line that follows this one does not provide a rhyme for \"countour\". For example, one version of the next line is \"Sete to rekene in hys scryve\". This is a well-known textual anomaly in *The Book of the Duchess*. The line ending in \"countour\" is an \"orphan\" line, left without a rhyming partner within the couplet structure of the poem.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\n*   \"Wente\" is rhymed.\n*   \"Here\" is rhymed.\n*   \"Fool\" is rhymed.\n*   \"Hool\" is rhymed.\n*   \"Countour\" appears at the end of a line but lacks a rhyming partner in the text as it has been transmitted.\n\nTherefore, \"Countour\" is the word that Chaucer does not make a rhyme with in *The Book of the Duchess*.\n\n<<<E>>>"
