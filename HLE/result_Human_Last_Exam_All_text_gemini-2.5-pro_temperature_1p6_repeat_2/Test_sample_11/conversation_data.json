    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The goal is to identify the *first statute* passed in the *modern State of Israel* (post-1948) that *explicitly introduced* the legal concept of \"good faith\". The answer should not include \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   Many legal scholars and students would immediately point to the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Sections 12 and 39 of this law established \"good faith\" as a broad, overarching principle governing negotiations and the performance of all contracts.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and 1973 is relatively late in Israel's legislative history. It is crucial to look for earlier laws.\n\n3.  **Investigating the \"Codification Era\" (1960s):** Before the general Contracts Law, the Knesset enacted several specific statutes that were part of a major effort to create an original body of Israeli private law to replace the older Ottoman and British Mandate laws. We should examine these.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 34 of this law deals with the \"market overt\" rule and protects a buyer who purchased an asset \"in good faith\" (in Hebrew, `be'tom lev`).\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 9 of this law addresses conflicting transactions and gives preference to a later party who acted \"in good faith.\"\n    *   Since the Sale Law (1968) predates the Land Law (1969) and the Contracts Law (1973), it is a stronger candidate than those two. This confirms that the Contracts (General Part) Law was not the first.\n\n4.  **Searching for Even Earlier Statutes (Pre-1960s):** We must now check for any statutes enacted between 1948 and 1968. A key category of early Israeli legislation is \"New Version\" (`Nusach Hadash`) laws. These were official Hebrew-language restatements of British Mandate-era ordinances, passed and re-enacted by the Knesset, making them official statutes of the State of Israel.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Correct Statute:**\n    *   The **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957**, falls into this category. It is an Israeli statute passed by the Knesset.\n    *   Section 29 of this Ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" (a central concept in the law of negotiable instruments) as a person who took a bill of exchange, among other things, \"in good faith\" (`be'tom lev`).\n    *   The year of this statute is **1957**. This is significantly earlier than the Sale Law (1968) and the other laws from the codification period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, is famous for elevating \"good faith\" to a general principle, it was not the first statute to explicitly use the term. That distinction belongs to an earlier \"New Version\" ordinance from the 1950s. The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957, explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" (`tom lev`) and thus represents its first introduction into the statutory law of the modern State of Israel.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
