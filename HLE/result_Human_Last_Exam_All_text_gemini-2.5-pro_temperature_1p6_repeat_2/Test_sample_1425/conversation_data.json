    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of the Grand Canonical Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function Z for a quantum system is defined by the trace over the entire Fock space of the operator $e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})}$, where:\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, determined by the reservoir with which the system can exchange particles and energy.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\n\n**2. Interpret the Given Hamiltonian and Ensemble**\n\nThe question specifies that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. The question also states that we are in the grand canonical ensemble. A key point of interpretation is whether the symbol `μ` in the Hamiltonian is the same as the chemical potential `μ` of the ensemble. The standard convention and the use of the same symbol strongly suggest they are identical.\n\nSubstituting the given Hamiltonian into the general formula for Z:\n$\\hat{H}_{operator\\_in\\_exponent} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nTherefore, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right] = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$\n\n**3. Relate to a Standard Path Integral Problem**\n\nThe expression $Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$ is mathematically equivalent to the grand canonical partition function of a system of non-interacting particles with:\n*   A zero-energy Hamiltonian, $H_0 = 0$.\n*   An effective chemical potential, $\\mu_{eff} = 2\\mu$.\n\nThe path integral formulation for the grand canonical partition function of a system with Hamiltonian $H_0$ and chemical potential $\\mu_{eff}$ is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$\nwhere the action $S$ is:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ \\phi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu_{eff})\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) + H_0(\\phi^*, \\phi) \\right]$\n\nIn our case, $H_0 = 0$ and $\\mu_{eff} = 2\\mu$, so the action simplifies to:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ \\phi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\right]$\n\n**4. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe evaluation of this path integral is a standard result for a free Bose gas (using complex scalar fields $\\phi$ implies bosons). The result of the path integral is a product of contributions from each single-particle mode (e.g., momentum modes $\\mathbf{k}$). The partition function for a free Bose gas is:\n$Z = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\mu_{eff})}}$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the energy of a particle in mode $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nIn our system, the Hamiltonian $H=-\\mu N$ contains no spatial or momentum-dependent terms (like a kinetic energy term $\\propto k^2$). This implies that all single-particle energy states are degenerate. We can set their energy to zero, $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} = 0$ for all $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nIf we were to consider a system with a macroscopic volume, the product over an infinite (or very large) number of modes $\\mathbf{k}$ would cause the result to diverge. The lack of spatial dependence in the Hamiltonian strongly suggests that the problem is simplified to a system with only one available mode (or a single degenerate energy level). This is a common simplification in such problems to yield a finite result.\n\nFor a single-mode system, the product $\\prod_{\\mathbf{k}}$ collapses to a single term.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nUsing the formula for a single mode with the parameters identified:\n*   Single-particle energy: $\\epsilon = 0$\n*   Effective chemical potential: $\\mu_{eff} = 2\\mu$\n\nThe partition function Z is:\n$Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu_{eff})}} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(0 - 2\\mu)}} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Particle Statistics:** The path integral with a complex scalar field $\\phi$ describes bosons. For fermions, the result would be $Z_F = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$. The problem phrasing suggests the standard bosonic case.\n*   **Convergence:** The result is a geometric series sum, which only converges if the term in the exponent is negative. This requires $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, which means the chemical potential **μ must be negative** ($\\mu < 0$) for the system to be stable.\n*   **Single-Mode Assumption:** The resolution of the divergent product over modes relies on interpreting the problem as being effectively zero-dimensional or single-mode, a conclusion supported by the form of the given Hamiltonian.\n\nFinal calculation gives the partition function Z.\n\n<<<The partition function Z is given by $Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$, assuming the particles are bosons and for the result to be well-defined, it requires $\\mu < 0$.>>>"
