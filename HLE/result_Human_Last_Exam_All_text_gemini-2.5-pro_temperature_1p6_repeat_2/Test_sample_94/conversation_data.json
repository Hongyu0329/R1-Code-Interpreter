    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key pieces of information.**\nThe question provides several specific clues to identify a particular physicist:\n*   **Field of Fame:** Primarily known for work in microscopy.\n*   **Discovery:** An optical effect related to real imagery.\n*   **Origin of Discovery:** Based on an accidental observation.\n*   **Observer:** The observation was made by a custodial worker (janitor).\n*   **Object Involved:** The worker was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the most unique and specific clue.**\nThe most distinctive part of the question is the story about the custodial worker's observation. This is a specific anecdote from the history of science and the most effective clue to search for. The story involves the challenge of focusing light (or other radiation) using curved mirrors.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the anecdote to a specific physicist and invention.**\nThe historical account that perfectly matches these details concerns the physicist **Paul Kirkpatrick** and the development of the X-ray microscope.\n*   In the 1940s at Stanford University, Paul Kirkpatrick was trying to create an X-ray microscope, which required a method to focus X-rays. X-rays are difficult to focus with conventional lenses or mirrors because they tend to pass through or be absorbed by most materials.\n*   A janitor at Stanford, a Mr. Gurney, noticed Kirkpatrick's struggles. He mentioned that when he polished long, concave, cylindrical mirrors (like those from a funhouse), he could see a sharp, focused line-like reflection of the filament of an overhead light bulb, but only when he looked at the mirror from a very shallow, or \"grazing,\" angle.\n\n**Step 4: Verify how this observation led to the discovery.**\n*   Kirkpatrick realized that this effect—forming a sharp line focus using grazing incidence reflection from a single cylindrical mirror—was the solution to his problem.\n*   He and his graduate student, Albert Baez, designed a system using two such cylindrical concave mirrors. The first mirror would focus the X-rays into a line. A second mirror, placed after the first and oriented perpendicularly to it, would then focus that line into a single point.\n*   This system, known as the **Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror**, became a foundational technology for focusing X-rays.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm that all clues from the question align with Paul Kirkpatrick.**\n*   **Physicist better known for work in microscopy?** Yes, Paul Kirkpatrick is a renowned figure for his pioneering work in X-ray microscopy and the invention of the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system.\n*   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, he developed a practical method for creating a real, focused image using X-rays, based on the optical effect of grazing incidence reflection.\n*   **Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?** Yes, this perfectly matches the well-documented story of Mr. Gurney's observation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll points of the question lead directly to Paul Kirkpatrick, whose work on the X-ray microscope was crucially inspired by an observation shared by a janitor.\n\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"
