    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify two specific individuals. The criteria for these individuals are:\n1.  They are Nobel laureates.\n2.  They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n3.  The commercial was part of a campaign from the year 2000.\n4.  The campaign's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Listing Careful Points**\n\n*   **Enron's Reputation:** The question specifically uses the word \"infamous\" to describe the commercial. This is because Enron collapsed in a massive accounting scandal in 2001, just a year after this ad campaign ran. The campaign, which was designed to portray Enron as innovative and forward-thinking, is now viewed with deep irony.\n*   **The \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** This was a high-profile public relations effort by Enron to rebrand itself from a simple energy company to a sophisticated, knowledge-based corporation dealing in a wide range of commodities and services. The tagline itself became ironic when investigations revealed that had more people \"asked why\" about Enron's miraculous profits, the fraud might have been uncovered sooner.\n*   **The term \"Nobel laureates\":** A crucial point of ambiguity is whether the individuals had to be Nobel laureates *at the time the commercial aired* in 2000, or if they could have won the prize later. The phrasing \"Which two Nobel laureates were featured\" generally refers to their status now (or at any point). We must verify the timeline of their awards.\n*   **Identifying the Individuals:** The task requires recalling or researching the specific talent used in this well-known, yet ironic, ad campaign. The campaign featured several prominent figures, but the question specifically asks for the two who were also Nobel prize winners.\n\n**Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\n1.  Researching the Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign from 2000 confirms it was a real and significant marketing effort. Videos and analyses of the commercials are available online and in documentaries like \"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.\"\n\n2.  The campaign featured several short television spots. Two of these spots featured prominent economists who are also Nobel laureates.\n\n3.  **First Laureate: Myron Scholes.**\n    *   He was featured in one of the commercials.\n    *   He is a financial economist, famous for the Black-Scholes-Merton model for pricing options.\n    *   He, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997**.\n    *   *Conclusion:* Since he won his Nobel Prize before the 2000 commercial, he was indeed a Nobel laureate at the time he appeared in the ad.\n\n4.  **Second Laureate: Paul Krugman.**\n    *   He was also featured in a separate \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n    *   He is a renowned economist, columnist, and author.\n    *   He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** for his work on New Trade Theory.\n    *   *Conclusion:* At the time the commercial aired in 2000, Paul Krugman was a famous economist but was *not yet* a Nobel laureate. However, because he did eventually win the prize, he fits the description of a \"Nobel laureate who was featured\" in the ad. This aligns with the common interpretation of the trivia question.\n\n5.  **Final Synthesis:** The two individuals who fit all the criteria are Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman. Both are Nobel laureates in Economics, and both appeared in Enron's infamous \"Ask Why\" ad campaign in 2000.\n\n<<<Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman>>>"
