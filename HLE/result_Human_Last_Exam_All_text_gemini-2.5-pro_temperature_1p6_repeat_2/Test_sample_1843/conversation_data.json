    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we will follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Factor the conductor N into prime powers.**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$\nThe prime power factors of $N$ are $4, 9, 7, 11, 13$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the structure of Dirichlet characters.**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo each prime power factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\nTwo key properties of this decomposition are:\n1.  **Primitivity:** The character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive modulo its respective prime power $p^a$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_9), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe need to find the number of such tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ for which the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the primitive characters for each prime power factor.**\n\nFor each factor $p^a$, we need to find the number of primitive characters and their possible orders. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ (where $d|m$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n\n*   **For modulus $4 = 2^2$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one principal character (conductor 1, order 1) and one non-principal character. The non-principal character is primitive modulo 4, and its order is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters: 1.\n    *   Order of the primitive character ($k_4$): 2.\n\n*   **For modulus $9 = 3^2$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character mod 9 is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, primitive characters have orders 3 or 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   So, for $\\chi_9$, the order $k_9$ must be 3 or 6. There are $2+2=4$ choices.\n\n*   **For modulus $7$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character is primitive if it is not the principal character (which has conductor 1). So primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   For $\\chi_7$, the order $k_7$ can be 2, 3, or 6. There are $1+2+2=5$ choices.\n\n*   **For modulus $11$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. Primitive characters can have orders 2, 5, or 10. The order $k_{11}$ must divide 6 for the final lcm to be 6. The only order that divides both 10 and 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   For $\\chi_{11}$, the order $k_{11}$ must be 2. There is 1 choice.\n\n*   **For modulus $13$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. Primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12. The order $k_{13}$ must divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, or 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   For $\\chi_{13}$, the order $k_{13}$ can be 2, 3, or 6. There are $1+2+2=5$ choices.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to satisfy the order condition.**\n\nWe need to choose a tuple of primitive characters, one for each modulus, such that the lcm of their orders is 6. Let the orders be $(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$.\n\nFrom Step 3, we have the following constraints on the orders:\n*   $k_4 = 2$\n*   $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $k_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $k_{11} = 2$\n*   $k_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nLet's check the lcm condition: $\\operatorname{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}) = 6$.\n1.  Since all possible orders are divisors of 6, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6.\n2.  Since we must choose the primitive character modulo 4, its order is $k_4 = 2$. This means the lcm must be divisible by 2.\n3.  Since we must choose a primitive character modulo 9, its order $k_9$ must be 3 or 6. In either case, $k_9$ is divisible by 3, so the lcm must be divisible by 3.\n4.  An integer that is divisible by both 2 and 3 must be divisible by 6.\n5.  Since the lcm must divide 6 and be divisible by 6, the lcm must be exactly 6.\n\nThis means that any valid combination of primitive characters (with orders dividing 6) will automatically result in a character of order 6.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of characters.**\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character:\n*   Choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (the unique primitive character of order 2).\n*   Choices for $\\chi_9$: 4 (2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n*   Choices for $\\chi_7$: 5 (1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n*   Choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (the unique primitive character of order 2).\n*   Choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5 (1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
