    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the central pixel using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe goal is to find the single \"central\" pixel of a line drawn between the coordinates (1, 1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's algorithm. This requires us to first generate the sequence of pixels for the line and then identify the middle pixel from that sequence.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Algorithm Variant:** We will use the standard integer-based Bresenham's algorithm for slopes between 0 and 1.\n2.  **Endpoints:** The starting point (x₀, y₀) is (1, 1) and the ending point (x₁, y₁) is (11, 5).\n3.  **Dominant Axis:** We need to determine if the line is \"steep\" (change in y is greater than change in x) or \"shallow\" (change in x is greater than change in y). This decides which coordinate is always incremented.\n4.  **Number of Pixels:** To find the central pixel, we must first know the total number of pixels in the line.\n5.  **Central Index:** For an odd number of pixels, there is a unique central pixel. For an even number, there are two. We must check which case this is.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate `dx` and `dy`**\nFirst, we find the total change in x and y.\n*   `dx = x₁ - x₀ = 11 - 1 = 10`\n*   `dy = y₁ - y₀ = 5 - 1 = 4`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Dominant Axis and Total Pixel Count**\nThe slope of the line `m = dy / dx = 4 / 10 = 0.4`.\n*   Since `0 < m < 1` (because `dx > dy > 0`), the x-axis is the dominant axis.\n*   This means that for every step, we will increment `x` by 1, and decide whether to increment `y`.\n*   The total number of pixels drawn will be `dx + 1`.\n*   Total pixels = `10 + 1 = 11`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Index of the Central Pixel**\n*   We have 11 pixels in total, which is an odd number.\n*   The central pixel will be at the position `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6`.\n*   So, we need to find the 6th pixel generated by the algorithm.\n\n**Step 4: Initialize Bresenham's Algorithm**\n*   The first pixel is the starting point: **(1, 1)**.\n*   The initial decision parameter `p` is calculated as `p = 2 * dy - dx`.\n*   `p = 2 * 4 - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2`.\n\n**Step 5: Iterate to Find the 6th Pixel**\nWe will generate the pixels one by one until we reach the 6th one. The rule is: at each step, increment `x`. If the decision parameter `p` is less than 0, `y` stays the same and `p` is updated by `p + 2*dy`. If `p` is 0 or greater, `y` is incremented, and `p` is updated by `p + 2*dy - 2*dx`.\n\n*   **Pixel 1:** (1, 1)\n    *   Current state: `x=1`, `y=1`, `p=-2`\n\n*   **Pixel 2:**\n    *   `x` increments to 2.\n    *   Since `p < 0` (`-2 < 0`), `y` remains 1.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = -2 + 2*dy = -2 + 8 = 6`.\n    *   The pixel is **(2, 1)**.\n\n*   **Pixel 3:**\n    *   `x` increments to 3.\n    *   Since `p > 0` (`6 > 0`), `y` increments to 2.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = 6 + 2*dy - 2*dx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n    *   The pixel is **(3, 2)**.\n\n*   **Pixel 4:**\n    *   `x` increments to 4.\n    *   Since `p < 0` (`-6 < 0`), `y` remains 2.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = -6 + 2*dy = -6 + 8 = 2`.\n    *   The pixel is **(4, 2)**.\n\n*   **Pixel 5:**\n    *   `x` increments to 5.\n    *   Since `p > 0` (`2 > 0`), `y` increments to 3.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = 2 + 2*dy - 2*dx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n    *   The pixel is **(5, 3)**.\n\n*   **Pixel 6:**\n    *   `x` increments to 6.\n    *   Since `p < 0` (`-10 < 0`), `y` remains 3.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = -10 + 2*dy = -10 + 8 = -2`.\n    *   The pixel is **(6, 3)**.\n\nWe have reached the 6th pixel in the sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe central pixel is the 6th pixel generated by the algorithm, which is (6, 3). This also corresponds to the geometric midpoint of the line segment `((1+11)/2, (1+5)/2) = (6, 3)`.\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
