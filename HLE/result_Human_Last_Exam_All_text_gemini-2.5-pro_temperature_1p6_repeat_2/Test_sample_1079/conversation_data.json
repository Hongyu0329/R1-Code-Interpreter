    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the properties of the H3 reflection group and the concept of regular eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3:** This is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. It is a finite Coxeter group of rank 3.\n*   **Order of H3:** The group H3 has |H3| = 120 elements.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number `h` is 10. This is a fundamental invariant of the group. The degrees of the fundamental invariants for H3 are `d_1=2`, `d_2=6`, and `d_3=10`. The Coxeter number is the largest degree, `h=d_3=10`.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of a group element `g` is called regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. The corresponding eigenvalue is then called a regular eigenvalue.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` has order 10 if `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`. This means `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n**Step 2: Connect regular eigenvectors to Coxeter elements**\n\nA crucial theorem by T.A. Springer states that an element `g` in a finite Coxeter group `W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `g` is conjugate to a Coxeter element.\nA Coxeter element `c` is a product of all the simple reflections, taken once in any order (e.g., `c = s_1 s_2 s_3`). For an irreducible Coxeter group like H3, all Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other.\nTherefore, the question is asking for the number of elements that belong to the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element and satisfy the eigenvalue condition.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the properties of the Coxeter class of H3**\n\nLet `C(c)` be the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element `c`.\n*   **Size of the class:** The size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element is given by `|W| / h`, where `|W|` is the order of the group and `h` is the Coxeter number.\n    For H3, this is `|C(c)| = |H3| / h = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n    This means there are exactly 12 elements in H3 that have a regular eigenvector.\n*   **Order of the elements:** The order of a Coxeter element (and thus any element in its conjugacy class) is `h`. So, all 12 of these elements have order 10.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the eigenvalues of elements in the Coxeter class**\n\nNow we need to check if these 12 elements satisfy the second condition: having a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has order 10.\n\n*   **Eigenvalues of a Coxeter element:** The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` are given by the formula `exp(2πi * (d_j - 1) / h)`, where `d_j` are the degrees of the fundamental invariants.\n    For H3, the eigenvalues are:\n    *   `λ_1 = exp(2πi * (2 - 1) / 10) = exp(2πi / 10)`\n    *   `λ_2 = exp(2πi * (6 - 1) / 10) = exp(10πi / 10) = exp(πi) = -1`\n    *   `λ_3 = exp(2πi * (10 - 1) / 10) = exp(18πi / 10)`\n*   **Order of eigenvalues:**\n    *   `λ_1` is a primitive 10th root of unity, so its order is 10.\n    *   `λ_2` has order 2.\n    *   `λ_3` is a primitive 10th root of unity (`gcd(9,10)=1`), so its order is 10.\n    Any element `g` in the conjugacy class `C(c)` will have this same set of eigenvalues.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the regular eigenvalues**\n\nA theorem by Lehrer and Springer states that for a regular element `g` (one conjugate to a Coxeter element), its regular eigenvalues are precisely the eigenvalues of `g` that are primitive `k`-th roots of unity, where `k` is the order of `g`.\n\n*   For any `g` in the Coxeter class `C(c)`, its order is `k = h = 10`.\n*   Its eigenvalues are `{exp(2πi/10), -1, exp(18πi/10)}`.\n*   The primitive 10th roots of unity are `exp(2πij/10)` for `j ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n*   Comparing the set of eigenvalues with the set of primitive 10th roots of unity, we find that the regular eigenvalues of `g` are `{exp(2πi/10), exp(18πi/10)}`.\n*   Both of these regular eigenvalues have order 10.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  An element `g` has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is one of the 12 elements in the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element.\n2.  For every single one of these 12 elements, we have shown that it has exactly two regular eigenvalues (`exp(2πi/10)` and `exp(18πi/10)`).\n3.  The order of these regular eigenvalues is 10, which is the Coxeter number.\n4.  Therefore, all 12 elements in the Coxeter class satisfy the conditions of the question.\n\nThe number of such elements is the size of the conjugacy class of the Coxeter element.\n\nNumber of elements = `|H3| / h` = 120 / 10 = 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
