    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the novel and the main character:** The question concerns the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Polish author Jacek Dukaj. The main character of this novel is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is cryogenically frozen and resurrected thousands of years in the future.\n\n2.  **Analyze the main character's relationships:** Throughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski's most significant and defining relationship is with a post-human entity named Angelina. She acts as his guide, protector, and mentor in the profoundly alien future world he finds himself in.\n\n3.  **Interpret the term \"marries\" in the context of the novel:** The world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a post-singularity setting where traditional human concepts like marriage, identity, and love have been radically transformed or are no longer practiced in the same way. The novel does not feature a traditional wedding ceremony for Adam Zamoyski.\n\n4.  **Determine the functional equivalent of marriage:** Despite the absence of a formal ceremony, Adam and Angelina's bond is the central romantic and partnership arc of the story. Their relationship is an incredibly deep, symbiotic, and exclusive union. Angelina remakes and fundamentally alters Adam, and they become inextricably linked. For all narrative purposes, she is his partner and wife-figure. Therefore, when asked who the main character marries, Angelina is the correct and intended answer, as their union is the functional and narrative equivalent of a marriage.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Context is Key:** It is crucial to understand that in science fiction, especially in a far-future setting like Dukaj's, one must interpret familiar concepts like \"marriage\" within the new rules of the fictional world. A literal, legalistic interpretation might lead to an incorrect or incomplete answer.\n*   **Narrative Role:** Angelina's role in the story is that of the main character's primary partner. Their deep and exclusive bond is the emotional core of the novel.\n*   **Absence of Alternatives:** There are no other characters in the novel with whom Adam Zamoyski forms a similar marriage-like bond.\n\nBy analyzing the narrative roles and the contextual meaning of partnership within the novel, we can confidently identify the character in question.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
