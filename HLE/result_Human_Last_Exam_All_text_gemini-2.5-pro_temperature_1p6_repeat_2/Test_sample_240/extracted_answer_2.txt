The most likely reason a functional MRI coil shows no resonance when probed with a magnetic loop is that its active decoupling circuit is in its default, non-resonant state. Modern coils use PIN diodes to actively "detune" themselves during the MRI's transmit cycle for safety and to prevent signal interference. On the bench, without the specific control voltage from the MRI scanner to switch it into the "receive" (resonant) mode, this circuit remains in its fail-safe, detuned state. Additionally, an unpowered integrated preamplifier presents an improper impedance load, which also spoils the resonance. Therefore, the coil is behaving exactly as designed for an unpowered, off-system state, and it remains fully functional when connected to the MRI system that provides the necessary power and control signals.
