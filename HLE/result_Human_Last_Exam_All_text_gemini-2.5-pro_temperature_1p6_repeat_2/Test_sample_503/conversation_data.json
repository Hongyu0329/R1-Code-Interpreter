    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of morphisms and two 2-morphisms that satisfy certain conditions. Let's break down these concepts step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category**\n\n*   **Objects (0-cells):** The objects are the finite ordinals $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ for $k \\ge 0$. In our case, the objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n*   **Morphisms (1-cells):** For any two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$, a morphism from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$. That is, if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-Morphisms (2-cells):** Given two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f$ is pointwise less than or equal to $g$. This means $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in [m]$. We denote this by $f \\le g$. Since for any pair of morphisms there is at most one 2-morphism between them (in a given direction), this makes $\\Delta$ a locally posetal 2-category.\n\n**Step 2: Define an internal adjunction in this context**\n\nAn internal adjunction from $[23]$ to $[37]$ consists of:\n1.  A pair of morphisms (1-cells): $f: [23] \\to [37]$ and $g: [37] \\to [23]$.\n2.  Two 2-morphisms, the unit ($\\eta$) and the counit ($\\varepsilon$):\n    *   The unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\to g \\circ f$. In this specific 2-category, this means $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(x) \\le (g \\circ f)(x)$ for all $x \\in [23]$, which simplifies to $x \\le g(f(x))$.\n    *   The counit $\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(f \\circ g)(y) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(y)$ for all $y \\in [37]$, which simplifies to $f(g(y)) \\le y$.\n3.  The triangle identities must hold. In a posetal 2-category, these identities are always satisfied if the unit and counit exist.\n\nThe two inequalities, $x \\le g(f(x))$ and $f(g(y)) \\le y$, for order-preserving maps $f$ and $g$ between posets, is the definition of a Galois connection (or an adjunction between posets), where $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint ($f \\dashv g$).\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $(f, g)$ between $[23]$ and $[37]$ that form a Galois connection.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of such adjunctions**\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoints $f: [23] \\to [37]$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: P \\to Q$ between two posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins).\nThe posets in our case are $[m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. These are finite totally ordered sets.\n\nFor any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, its supremum is its maximum element, $\\sup(S) = \\max(S)$. Any order-preserving map $f$ automatically preserves maxima of non-empty sets (i.e., $f(\\max S) = \\max f(S)$).\n\nThe crucial condition comes from preserving the supremum of the empty set, $\\sup(\\emptyset)$. In a poset with a minimum element, this minimum element is the supremum of the empty set.\n*   In the poset $[m]$, the minimum element is $0$. So, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$ in $[m]$.\n*   In the poset $[n]$, the minimum element is $0$. So, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$ in $[n]$.\n\nThe condition that $f$ preserves the supremum of the empty set is $f(\\sup_{[m]}(\\emptyset)) = \\sup_{[n]}(f(\\emptyset))$.\nThis translates to $f(0) = \\sup_{[n]}(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n\nSo, a map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $f(0) = 0$. The number of internal adjunctions is the number of such maps.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of these maps**\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $f$ is defined by the sequence of its values:\n$f(0), f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$.\nThe conditions on this sequence are:\n1.  $f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$.\n2.  Each $f(i)$ must be in $[37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n3.  $f(0) = 0$.\n\nCombining these, we need to count the number of sequences $(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_{23})$ such that $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$, where $y_i = f(i)$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. It is equivalent to choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $37+1=38$ elements) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as the sequence is ordered non-decreasingly).\n\nThis is a \"stars and bars\" problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $N$ with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{k+N-1}{k} $$\nIn our case, we are choosing $k=23$ values (for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$) from the set of $N=38$ possible values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{23 + 38 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAs a sanity check, we can also count the number of right adjoints $g: [37] \\to [23]$. A map $g$ is a right adjoint if it preserves all infima. The infimum of the empty set in $[k]$ is its maximum element, $k$. So the condition is $g(37) = 23$. We would need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$ where each value is in $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. This corresponds to choosing $k=37$ items from a set of size $N=24$, which gives $\\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$ and $\\binom{60}{37} = \\frac{60!}{37!23!}$, the results match.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$."
