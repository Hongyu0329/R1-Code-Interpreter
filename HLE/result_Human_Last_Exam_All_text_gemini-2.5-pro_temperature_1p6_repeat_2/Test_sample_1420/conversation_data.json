    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Scaling Exponent $\\alpha$:** In the vicinity of a continuous phase transition, the singular part of the specific heat, $C_{sing}$, is expected to scale with the reduced temperature $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$ as $C_{sing} \\sim |t|^{-\\alpha}$. The exponent $\\alpha$ is a universal critical exponent.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** This is the spatial dimension at and above which the critical exponents take their simpler, mean-field theory values. For a large class of models described by the $\\phi^4$ theory (including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$.\n*   **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion:** This is a powerful technique developed by Wilson and Fisher within the renormalization group (RG) framework. It treats the deviation from the upper critical dimension, $\\epsilon = d_c - d$, as a small parameter and calculates critical exponents as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Problem**\n\n*   We are given the spatial dimension $d=3$.\n*   We use the standard $\\phi^4$ theory, for which $d_c=4$.\n*   Therefore, the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n*   The goal is to calculate $\\alpha$ using the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion. Although $\\epsilon=1$ is not small, this procedure gives a reasonable first approximation for the exponents in $d=3$.\n\n**3. Identify Key Relationships (Scaling Laws)**\n\nThe critical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling laws. A crucial one for this problem is the **hyperscaling relation** (also known as Josephson's identity):\n$2 - \\alpha = \\nu d$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the critical exponent for the correlation length ($\\xi \\sim |t|^{-\\nu}$).\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\nu d$\n\n**4. The Epsilon Expansion for $\\nu$**\n\nThe epsilon expansion provides the expression for the exponents as a series in $\\epsilon$. The result depends on the number of components, $N$, of the order parameter (e.g., $N=1$ for the Ising model, $N=2$ for the XY model, $N=3$ for the Heisenberg model).\n\nTo first order in $\\epsilon$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ for the O(N) model is given by:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**5. Derivation of $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\epsilon$**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $\\nu$ and $d=4-\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation. We will only keep terms up to the first power of $\\epsilon$.\n\n*   Start with the relation: $\\alpha = 2 - \\nu d$\n*   Substitute $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ and the series for $\\nu$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + \\dots\\right)(4 - \\epsilon)$\n*   Expand the product, keeping terms up to order $\\epsilon$:\n    $\\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(4) + \\left(\\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon\\right)(4) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(\\epsilon) \\right]$\n    (The term $(\\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon)(-\\epsilon)$ is of order $\\epsilon^2$ and is dropped).\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    $\\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right]$\n    $\\alpha \\approx 2 - 2 - \\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\epsilon + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\right)\\epsilon$\n*   Combine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator:\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\left(\\frac{1(N+8) - 2(N+2)}{2(N+8)}\\right)\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\left(\\frac{N+8 - 2N - 4}{2(N+8)}\\right)\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon$\n\nThis is the general first-order result for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ in the O(N) model.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Model Ambiguity:** The question does not specify the universality class (i.e., the value of N). In such a context, it is standard practice to consider the simplest and most fundamental case: the **Ising model**, which corresponds to a one-component order parameter ($N=1$).\n2.  **Approximation Level:** This is a first-order calculation in $\\epsilon$. The result is an approximation. Higher-order terms in the expansion are necessary for more accurate values, especially since we are evaluating at $\\epsilon=1$.\n3.  **Hyperscaling Relation:** The validity of the hyperscaling relation itself depends on the dimension. It holds for $d < d_c=4$, which is the regime where the $\\epsilon$-expansion is applied.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1:** Set the parameters according to the question and the standard model choice (Ising).\n*   Spatial dimension: $d=3$\n*   Upper critical dimension: $d_c=4$\n*   Expansion parameter: $\\epsilon = 4-3=1$\n*   Number of components for the Ising model: $N=1$\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute these values into the derived formula for $\\alpha$.\n*   Formula: $\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon$\n*   Substitution: $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1$\n*   Calculation: $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2(9)} = \\frac{3}{18}$\n\n**Step 3:** Simplify the result.\n*   $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis value, approximately 0.167, is the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion result for the specific heat exponent in the 3D Ising model.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
