    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Given Data:**\n    *   `x(n)` and `h(n)` are 4-point sequences.\n    *   `X(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `x(n)`, with `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\n    *   `H(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `h(n)`, with `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n    *   We need to find the DFT of a new sequence `y(n)`.\n\n2.  **Target Sequence:**\n    The new sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. This is an 8-point sequence.\n\n3.  **The Core Problem:**\n    The question asks for the **4-point DFT** of this **8-point sequence** `y(n)`. This operation is mathematically well-defined and involves aliasing the 8-point sequence in the time domain before computing the DFT.\n\n4.  **Key Property:**\n    There's a direct relationship between the DFT of a sequence and the DFT of its time-aliased version. Let `Y_8(k)` be the 8-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. Let `Y_4(k)` be the 4-point DFT we are looking for. The property states:\n    `Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    This means the desired 4-point DFT is simply the set of even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. Our strategy will be to find `Y_8(k)` first and then extract the required samples.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Define the relationship between the 8-point DFT `Y_8(k)` and the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.**\n\nThe sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`. The even-indexed samples of `y(n)` are `y(2m) = x(m)`, and the odd-indexed samples are `y(2m+1) = h(m)`.\n\nThe formula for the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, based on the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT algorithm structure, is:\n`Y_8(k) = DFT{x(m)} + W_8^k * DFT{h(m)}`\nHere, `DFT{x(m)}` and `DFT{h(m)}` are based on the 4-point DFTs. The formula is precisely:\n`Y_8(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\nwhere `W_N^k = exp(-j * 2πk / N)`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the required samples of `Y_8(k)`.**\n\nAccording to the property from the analysis, we only need to compute `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`.\n\n*   **Calculate `Y_4(0) = Y_8(0)`:**\n    `Y_8(0) = X(0 mod 4) + W_8^0 * H(0 mod 4)`\n    `Y_8(0) = X(0) + 1 * H(0)`\n    Using the given values `X(0)=1` and `H(0)=0`:\n    `Y_8(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate `Y_4(1) = Y_8(2)`:**\n    `Y_8(2) = X(2 mod 4) + W_8^2 * H(2 mod 4)`\n    `Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    We need `W_8^2 = exp(-j * 2π*2 / 8) = exp(-jπ/2) = -j`.\n    Using the given values `X(2)=-1` and `H(2)=1`:\n    `Y_8(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Calculate `Y_4(2) = Y_8(4)`:**\n    `Y_8(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4)`\n    `Y_8(4) = X(0) + W_8^4 * H(0)`\n    We need `W_8^4 = exp(-j * 2π*4 / 8) = exp(-jπ) = -1`.\n    Using the given values `X(0)=1` and `H(0)=0`:\n    `Y_8(4) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate `Y_4(3) = Y_8(6)`:**\n    `Y_8(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4)`\n    `Y_8(6) = X(2) + W_8^6 * H(2)`\n    We need `W_8^6 = exp(-j * 2π*6 / 8) = exp(-j3π/2) = j`.\n    Using the given values `X(2)=-1` and `H(2)=1`:\n    `Y_8(6) = -1 + (j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the final answer.**\n\nThe 4-point DFT is `Y_4(k) = {Y_4(0), Y_4(1), Y_4(2), Y_4(3)}`.\nCombining the results from Step 2:\n`Y_4(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]}$.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
