    "An analysis of the problem is as follows, breaking it down into methodical steps to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Fundamental Principle\n\nThe question asks which transformation is NOT possible for ANY unitary quantum gate. The key concept here is \"unitary\". A quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, U.\n\nA critical property of any unitary transformation is that it **preserves the inner product** between any two quantum states. Let ∣ψ⟩ and ∣φ⟩ be two state vectors. If a unitary gate U is applied to both, the inner product between the new states, U∣ψ⟩ and U∣φ⟩, must be the same as the inner product between the original states.\nMathematically: ⟨ψ∣φ⟩ = ⟨Uψ∣Uφ⟩.\n\nA direct consequence of this is that **orthogonality is preserved**. If two states are orthogonal, their inner product is 0 (⟨ψ∣φ⟩ = 0). After any unitary transformation, the resulting two states must also be orthogonal (⟨Uψ∣Uφ⟩ = 0).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Orthogonal Pairs Among the Basis States\n\nWe are given six basis states. We need to identify which pairs among them are orthogonal. We can do this by computing their inner products.\n\nThe vector representations of the states are:\n*   ∣0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ\n*   ∣1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ\n*   ∣+⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ\n*   ∣-⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ\n*   ∣i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ\n*   ∣-i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ\n\nThe orthogonal pairs (those with an inner product of 0) are:\n1.  **⟨0∣1⟩** = [1, 0] * [0, 1]ᵀ = 0. So, (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩) are orthogonal.\n2.  **⟨+∣-⟩** = (1/√2)[1, 1] * (1/√2)[1, -1]ᵀ = (1/2)(1 - 1) = 0. So, (∣+⟩, ∣-⟩) are orthogonal.\n3.  **⟨i∣-i⟩** = (1/√2)[1, -i] * (1/√2)[1, -i]ᵀ = (1/2)(1 - i²) = (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1. Wait, let me re-calculate the conjugate transpose of |i>.\n    ⟨i∣ = ((1/√2)(∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩))† = (1/√2)(⟨0∣ - i⟨1∣) = (1/√2)[1, -i]. Correct.\n    The inner product is: ⟨i∣-i⟩ = (1/√2)[1, -i] * (1/√2)[1, -i]ᵀ = (1/2) * (1 * 1 + (-i) * (-i)) = (1/2) * (1 + i²) = (1/2) * (1 - 1) = 0. So, (∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩) are orthogonal.\n\nSo, we have three pairs of mutually orthogonal states:\n*   {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}\n*   {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}\n*   {∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩}\nThese correspond to the opposite ends of the X, Y, and Z axes of the Bloch sphere.\n\n### Step 3: Test Each Answer Choice Against the Orthogonality Rule\n\nFor a transformation to be possible (unitary), it must map each of these orthogonal pairs to a new pair of states that are also orthogonal. We will examine each answer choice. The first one we find that violates this rule is our answer.\n\n*   **A**: (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩) → (∣1⟩, ∣0⟩) (Orthogonal). (∣+⟩, ∣-⟩) → (∣-⟩, ∣+⟩) (Orthogonal). (∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩) → (∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩) (Orthogonal). **Possible.**\n*   **B**: (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩) → (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩) (Orthogonal). (∣+⟩, ∣-⟩) → (∣-⟩, ∣+⟩) (Orthogonal). (∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩) → (∣-i⟩, ∣i⟩) (Orthogonal). **Possible.**\n*   **C**: (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩) → (∣+⟩, ∣-⟩) (Orthogonal). (∣+⟩, ∣-⟩) → (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩) (Orthogonal). (∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩) → (∣-i⟩, ∣i⟩) (Orthogonal). **Possible.**\n*   ... (We can continue this process for all options) ...\n\nLet's test option **I**:\n*   **I**:\n    *   ∣0⟩  →  ∣-i⟩\n    *   ∣1⟩  →  ∣i⟩\n    *   ∣+⟩  →  ∣+⟩\n    *   ∣-⟩  →  ∣+⟩\n    *   ∣i⟩  →  ∣0⟩\n    *   ∣-i⟩ →  ∣1⟩\n\n1.  Check the (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩) pair: They map to (∣-i⟩, ∣i⟩). Are these orthogonal? Yes, ⟨-i∣i⟩=0. This check passes.\n2.  Check the (∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩) pair: They map to (∣0⟩, ∣1⟩). Are these orthogonal? Yes, ⟨0∣1⟩=0. This check passes.\n3.  Check the (∣+⟩, ∣-⟩) pair:\n    *   ∣+⟩ maps to ∣+⟩.\n    *   ∣-⟩ maps to ∣+⟩.\n    *   The original pair (∣+⟩, ∣-⟩) is orthogonal.\n    *   The resulting pair is (∣+⟩, ∣+⟩). Are these states orthogonal? Let's calculate their inner product: ⟨+∣+⟩ = 1.\n    *   Since the inner product is 1 (not 0), the resulting states are not orthogonal.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option I maps an orthogonal pair of states, (∣+⟩, ∣-⟩), to a non-orthogonal pair of states, (∣+⟩, ∣+⟩). This violates the fundamental requirement that unitary operations must preserve inner products and orthogonality. Therefore, the transformation in option I is not possible for any unitary quantum gate. A quick check of the other options would reveal they all preserve the orthogonality of these three pairs.\n\n<<<I>>>"
