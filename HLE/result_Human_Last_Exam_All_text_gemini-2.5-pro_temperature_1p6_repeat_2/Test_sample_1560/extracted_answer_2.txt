After applying the gate Q to the first ququint and measuring it, the system will collapse into one of five possible states. The final state is probabilistic and is described by the following set of outcomes:
1.  With probability 1/5, the system becomes $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With probability 1/5, the system becomes $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With probability 3/10, the system becomes $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With probability 1/5, the system becomes $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With probability 1/10, the system becomes $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
