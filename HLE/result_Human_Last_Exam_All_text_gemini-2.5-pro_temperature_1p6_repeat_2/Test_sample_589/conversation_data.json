    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key elements.**\nThe question is looking for a specific scene in a film that must meet all of the following criteria:\n*   It is a Hollywood feature film.\n*   It was produced by a major film studio.\n*   It features a teenager.\n*   The teenager is riding a pink bicycle.\n*   The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key elements and search for potential matches.**\nThe most distinctive combination of elements is \"teenager,\" \"pink bike,\" and \"pedaling toward a car.\" This specific action suggests a scene of confrontation or defiance. We need to find a well-known film from a major studio that contains this exact sequence.\n\n*   **Initial thought process:** Many teen movies feature bikes (*E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*, *Stranger Things* - although that's a series), but the specific combination of a *pink* bike and riding *toward* a car is crucial. The movie *Pretty in Pink* has the color in the title, but the main character's iconic vehicle is a pink car, not a bike.\n*   **Focusing on the confrontation:** The act of a teenager on a bike confronting a car driven by antagonists is a powerful image. This brings to mind the 2017 horror film ***It***, based on the Stephen King novel.\n\n**Step 3: Verify if *It* (2017) meets all the criteria.**\n\n*   **Hollywood feature film?** Yes, *It* is a mainstream American film.\n*   **Produced by a major film studio?** Yes, it was produced by New Line Cinema, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Pictures, which is a major studio.\n*   **Teenager?** Yes. The character in question is Beverly Marsh (played by Sophia Lillis), a member of the Losers' Club, all of whom are young teenagers.\n*   **Rides a pink bike?** Yes. In the film, Beverly's bicycle is a distinct pink/magenta color.\n*   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. There is a specific scene where the bully Henry Bowers and his gang threaten the Losers' Club with their car (a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am). While the other Losers hesitate, Beverly Marsh defiantly pedals her pink bike directly toward Bowers' car, causing the bully to pause and eventually back down. The car is an \"oncoming\" threat that has stopped to confront them, and she rides directly at it.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe scene in the 2017 film *It* perfectly matches every detail described in the question. A teenage girl (Beverly Marsh) rides her pink bicycle directly toward a car full of bullies in an act of defiance. The film was a major production by Warner Bros./New Line Cinema.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
