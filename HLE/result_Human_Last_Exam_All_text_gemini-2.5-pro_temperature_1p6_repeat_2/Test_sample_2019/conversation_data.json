    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\nA toroidal chessboard wraps around both horizontally and vertically. This modifies the attack patterns of a queen. For a queen at position `(r, c)` (row, column), where `r, c` are in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, it attacks any square `(r', c')` if:\n1.  **Row attack:** `r' = r`\n2.  **Column attack:** `c' = c`\n3.  **Main diagonal attack:** `(r' + c') mod 5 = (r + c) mod 5`\n4.  **Anti-diagonal attack:** `(r' - c') mod 5 = (r - c) mod 5`\n\nWe want to place 4 non-attacking queens. Let their positions be `(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), (r_3, c_3), (r_4, c_4)`. The non-attacking condition implies that:\n*   The four row indices `{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}` must be distinct.\n*   The four column indices `{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}` must be distinct.\n*   The four main diagonal indices `{(r_1+c_1) mod 5, ..., (r_4+c_4) mod 5}` must be distinct.\n*   The four anti-diagonal indices `{(r_1-c_1) mod 5, ..., (r_4-c_4) mod 5}` must be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: A Combinatorial Reformulation\nA placement of 4 queens involves choosing 4 rows out of 5 and 4 columns out of 5. The placement is then a bijection (a one-to-one mapping) between the chosen rows and chosen columns.\n\nLet `R = {r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}` be the set of chosen rows and `C = {c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}` be the set of chosen columns.\nThis means there is one row not used, let's call it `r_miss`, and one column not used, `c_miss`. There are 5 choices for `r_miss` and 5 choices for `c_miss`, making 25 pairs of choices for the sets `R` and `C`.\n\nLet `N(R, C)` be the number of ways to place the queens on the squares defined by rows in `R` and columns in `C`. The total number of ways is the sum of `N(R, C)` over all 25 possible pairs of `(R, C)`.\n\n### Step 3: Using Symmetry to Simplify the Count\nThe toroidal board has a high degree of symmetry. Specifically, we can translate any configuration. A translation by `(a, b)` maps a point `(r, c)` to `(r+a, c+b) mod 5`.\n\nIf we have a valid configuration of 4 queens for the sets `(R, C)`, translating it by `(a, b)` results in a new valid configuration for the sets `(R+a, C+b)`. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the solutions for `(R, C)` and the solutions for `(R+a, C+b)`.\nTherefore, the number of solutions `N(R, C)` only depends on the \"structure\" of the sets, not their absolute positions. Since all sets of 4 rows (or columns) are equivalent up to translation (e.g., any set `Z_5 \\ {k}` can be translated to `Z_5 \\ {j}`), the number of solutions `N(R, C)` is a constant, `k`, for all 25 pairs of `(R, C)`.\n\nThe total number of ways is therefore `25 * k`. Our task reduces to finding the value of `k` for a single, convenient choice of `R` and `C`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Number of Ways for a Specific Case\nLet's choose the missing row `r_miss = 4` and the missing column `c_miss = 4`.\nThis means our queens are in rows `R = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and columns `C = {0, 1, 2, 3}`.\nA placement is a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3}`, where the queen in row `i` is in column `p(i)`. The positions are `(i, p(i))` for `i \\in {0, 1, 2, 3}`.\n\nWe now need to check the diagonal constraints for this specific case.\nLet `S_i = i + p(i) mod 5` and `D_i = i - p(i) mod 5`.\nThe set of sums `{S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3}` must have 4 distinct values.\nThe set of differences `{D_0, D_1, D_2, D_3}` must have 4 distinct values.\n\nWe can determine which values the sum and difference sets must avoid. A useful property is that for any valid configuration, the missing sum `s_miss` and missing difference `d_miss` are related to the missing row `r_miss` and column `c_miss` by:\n*   `s_miss = (r_miss + c_miss) mod 5`\n*   `d_miss = (r_miss - c_miss) mod 5`\n\nFor our case, `r_miss = 4` and `c_miss = 4`:\n*   `s_miss = (4 + 4) mod 5 = 8 mod 5 = 3`. The set of sums must be `Z_5 \\ {3} = {0, 1, 2, 4}`.\n*   `d_miss = (4 - 4) mod 5 = 0`. The set of differences must be `Z_5 \\ {0} = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of permutations `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3}` such that:\n1.  `{i + p(i) mod 5 | i=0,1,2,3} = {0, 1, 2, 4}`\n2.  `{i - p(i) mod 5 | i=0,1,2,3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}`\n\nThe second condition, `i - p(i) mod 5 != 0`, means `p(i) != i`. So, `p` must be a derangement of `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. There are `!4 = 9` such derangements. Let's test them.\n\nThe 9 derangements are composed of 4-cycles (6 of them) and pairs of 2-cycles (3 of them).\n\n**Test case:** Let `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)`. This is the permutation where p(0)=1, p(1)=3, p(2)=0, p(3)=2.\n*   `i - p(i) mod 5`:\n    *   0 - 1 = -1 ≡ 4\n    *   1 - 3 = -2 ≡ 3\n    *   2 - 0 = 2\n    *   3 - 2 = 1\n    The set of differences is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. This condition is met.\n*   `i + p(i) mod 5`:\n    *   0 + 1 = 1\n    *   1 + 3 = 4\n    *   2 + 0 = 2\n    *   3 + 2 = 5 ≡ 0\n    The set of sums is `{0, 1, 2, 4}`. This condition is also met.\nSo, `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)` is one valid permutation. This corresponds to the placement `{(0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2)}`.\n\n**Test case:** Let `p = (2, 0, 3, 1)`.\n*   `i - p(i) mod 5`:\n    *   0 - 2 = -2 ≡ 3\n    *   1 - 0 = 1\n    *   2 - 3 = -1 ≡ 4\n    *   3 - 1 = 2\n    The set of differences is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. This condition is met.\n*   `i + p(i) mod 5`:\n    *   0 + 2 = 2\n    *   1 + 0 = 1\n    *   2 + 3 = 5 ≡ 0\n    *   3 + 1 = 4\n    The set of sums is `{0, 1, 2, 4}`. This condition is also met.\nSo, `p = (2, 0, 3, 1)` is another valid permutation. This corresponds to the placement `{(0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1)}`.\n\nA full check of all 9 derangements reveals that no other permutation satisfies both conditions. For example, for `p = (3, 2, 1, 0)`:\n*   `i - p(i) mod 5`: {2, 4, 1, 3} (condition met)\n*   `i + p(i) mod 5`: {3, 3, 3, 3} (condition not met, set has only one element)\n\nTherefore, for our chosen `R` and `C`, there are exactly `k=2` ways to place the queens.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nSince the number of ways `k` is the same for any choice of the 4 rows and 4 columns, and there are 25 such choices, the total number of ways is:\nTotal ways = (Number of choices for R and C) × (Number of valid permutations for each choice)\nTotal ways = `25 * k = 25 * 2 = 50`."
