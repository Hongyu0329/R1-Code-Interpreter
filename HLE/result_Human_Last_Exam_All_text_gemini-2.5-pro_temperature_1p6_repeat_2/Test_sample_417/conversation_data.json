    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structure and symmetry:**\n    The molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    *   **Central Core:** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring substituted at all six positions. The groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methyl (`-CH3`) groups. The groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are identical, bulky substituents. This 1,3,5 / 2,4,6 substitution pattern gives the central core a C3 rotational axis of symmetry perpendicular to the plane of the benzene ring.\n    *   **Symmetry Implication:** Due to this C3 symmetry (assuming reasonably fast rotation around the single bonds connecting the substituents to the ring, which is standard for 1H NMR analysis at room temperature), all three `-CH3` groups are chemically equivalent, and all three large `-[((...)-yl)methyl]` substituents are also chemically equivalent.\n\n2.  **Count the signals from the central core and linkers:**\n    *   **Aromatic Methyl Groups:** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single peak in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n        *   Number of signals = **1**.\n    *   **Linker Methylene Groups:** The substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are connected to the benzene ring via a methylene (`-CH2-`) linker. So we have three `-CH2-` groups.\n        *   The C3 symmetry makes these three `-CH2-` groups chemically equivalent.\n        *   However, each `-CH2-` group is attached to a chiral center (the entire large indazole substituent is chiral, specified as `(4S,7R)`). Protons on a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent.\n        *   Therefore, the two protons within each `-CH2-` group will have different chemical shifts. Let's call them H_A and H_B.\n        *   All H_A protons in the molecule are equivalent to each other by C3 symmetry, and all H_B protons are equivalent to each other. But H_A and H_B are non-equivalent.\n        *   This results in two distinct signals for the linker protons. (These would typically appear as a pair of doublets, an AB quartet).\n        *   Number of signals = **2**.\n\n3.  **Count the signals from the chiral substituent:**\n    The substituent is `R = ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`. Since the three R groups are equivalent, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons within a single R group. This chiral group lacks any internal symmetry elements (like a mirror plane). Therefore, all protons that are not interchangeable by rapid rotation (like the protons of a methyl group) will be chemically distinct.\n    Let's analyze the structure of this substituent, which is a derivative of camphor, commonly known as camphopyrazole.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The name specifies `7,8,8-trimethyl`. This corresponds to the three methyl groups of the camphor skeleton. One methyl group is on a bridgehead carbon, and two are on the one-carbon bridge (gem-dimethyl).\n        *   The single methyl group gives 1 signal.\n        *   The two geminal methyl groups are attached to a prochiral center within a chiral molecule, making them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will give 2 separate signals.\n        *   Total signals from methyl groups = 1 + 2 = **3**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons (non-methyl):** The bicyclic skeleton (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) of camphor contains several other protons.\n        *   There is one methine proton (`-CH-`) at a bridgehead position. This gives **1** signal.\n        *   There are two methylene groups (`-CH2-`) forming part of the six-membered ring. Since the molecule is chiral, the two protons of each methylene group (the `exo` and `endo` protons) are diastereotopic. Each methylene group will therefore produce 2 signals.\n        *   Total signals from methylene groups = 2 + 2 = **4**.\n        *   Total signals from aliphatic CH/CH2 protons = 1 + 4 = **5**.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** The indazole part of the name refers to a pyrazole ring fused to the carbocyclic skeleton. A pyrazole ring in this context will have one proton attached to one of its carbons.\n        *   This gives **1** signal.\n    *   **Total signals from one substituent (R):** 3 (from -CH3) + 5 (from aliphatic -CH- and -CH2-) + 1 (from pyrazole -CH-) = **9**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of expected peaks:**\n    Summing the signals from all distinct parts of the molecule:\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from core -CH3) + (Signals from linker -CH2-) + (Signals from substituent R)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = **12**\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   **Symmetry:** Recognizing the C3 symmetry of the molecule is the first crucial step. This simplifies the problem from analyzing a huge molecule to analyzing one repeating unit plus the core.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** This is the key concept being tested. The protons of the `-CH2-` linkers are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral group. The protons of the gem-dimethyl group and the `exo`/`endo` protons of the `-CH2-` groups in the camphor skeleton are also diastereotopic due to the inherent chirality of the molecule. Each diastereotopic pair gives two distinct NMR signals.\n*   **Structure Interpretation:** The complex IUPAC name can be intimidating. Recognizing it as a common chiral auxiliary derived from camphor (camphopyrazole) helps in confidently determining its structure and the number of protons in it. Verifying the proton count (15 H in the C11H15N2 substituent) confirms the structural analysis.\n*   **Assumptions:** The analysis assumes a room-temperature spectrum where rotation around Ar-C bonds is fast, establishing the C3 symmetry on the NMR timescale. It also assumes no accidental overlap of peaks (accidental isochrony), as the question asks for the *expected* number of signals based on chemical equivalence.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n1 (Aromatic -CH3) + 2 (Linker -CH2-) + 9 (Chiral Substituent R) = 12 signals."
