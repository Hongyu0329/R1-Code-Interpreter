    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the radius of the large circle.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the radius of the smallest possible circle (the \"large circle\") that can contain 14 smaller circles, each with a radius of 1. This is a well-known mathematical problem called the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. The key is to find the most \"tightly packed\" or densest arrangement of the 14 smaller circles.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Correct Geometric Configuration**\nFor a given number of circles (N), the optimal arrangement is often non-intuitive and may not have perfect symmetry. The optimal packings for small values of N have been determined through a combination of geometric proofs and computational searches.\n\nOne might initially assume a simple, symmetric arrangement, like a central group of circles surrounded by others. For example, a piece of the standard hexagonal lattice packing. If we take a central group of 4 circles in a rhombus and surround them with 10 others, this creates a hexagonal-like cluster. The radius for such a configuration would be `R = 1 + sqrt(13) ≈ 4.6056`. However, this is **not** the optimal solution. The constraints of a circular boundary change the optimal arrangement.\n\nThe proven optimal configuration for N=14 was discovered by U. Pirl in 1969. This arrangement is the one that minimizes the radius of the enclosing circle.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Known Formula for N=14**\nFor the optimal packing of 14 circles of radius `r` into a larger circle of radius `R`, the following formula, derived from Pirl's configuration, gives the relationship between `R` and `r`:\n\n`R/r = 1 + 2 * sqrt( (4 + 2*sqrt(3)) / 3 )`\n\nSince we are given that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`, the formula for the radius `R` of the large circle simplifies to:\n\n`R = 1 + 2 * sqrt( (4 + 2*sqrt(3)) / 3 )`\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Radius R**\nWe will now calculate the value of R using the formula, keeping several decimal places for accuracy before the final rounding.\n\n1.  Calculate `sqrt(3)`:\n    `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732051`\n\n2.  Calculate the term `4 + 2*sqrt(3)`:\n    `4 + 2 * 1.732051 = 4 + 3.464102 = 7.464102`\n\n3.  Divide this result by 3:\n    `7.464102 / 3 ≈ 2.488034`\n\n4.  Take the square root of the result:\n    `sqrt(2.488034) ≈ 1.577350`\n\n5.  Multiply by 2:\n    `2 * 1.577350 = 3.154700`\n\n6.  Finally, add 1 to get the radius `R`:\n    `R = 1 + 3.154700 = 4.154700`\n\n**Step 5: Rounding to the Required Number of Significant Digits**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\nThe calculated value for R is approximately `4.1547`.\n\n*   The first significant digit is 4.\n*   The second significant digit is 1.\n*   The third significant digit is 5.\n*   The fourth significant digit is 4.\n\nTo round to 4 significant digits, we look at the fifth digit, which is 7. Since 7 is 5 or greater, we round up the fourth digit (4 becomes 5).\n\nSo, the radius `R` rounded to 4 significant digits is `4.155`.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   **Don't assume simple symmetry:** The optimal packing for N=14 is not a simple concentric or hexagonal arrangement.\n*   **Use established results:** This is a standard problem in mathematics, and using the known, proven result for N=14 is the correct approach.\n*   **Precise Calculation:** Carry extra decimal places throughout the calculation to prevent rounding errors from affecting the final answer.\n*   **Correct Rounding:** Apply the rules for significant figures correctly to the final calculated value. The 5th digit determines whether the 4th digit is rounded up or stays the same.\n\n<<<4.155>>>"
