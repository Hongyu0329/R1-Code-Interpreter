    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe want to find a factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$ in the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, where:\n*   $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are matrices whose elements are **stable** and **proper** rational functions. A function is stable if all its poles are in the open left-half of the complex plane (Re(s) < 0). A function is proper if the degree of its numerator is less than or equal to the degree of its denominator.\n*   $D(s)$ is a square, nonsingular matrix.\n*   $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are **left coprime**. This means the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane (RHP), which is for all $s$ such that Re(s) ≥ 0.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input transfer function H(s)**\nThe given transfer function is:\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFirst, let's identify the poles of each element:\n*   $H_{11}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$: Pole at $s = -1$.\n*   $H_{12}(s) = 1$: No poles.\n*   $H_{21}(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$: Poles at $s = 1$ and $s = -1$.\n*   $H_{22}(s) = 0$: No poles.\n\nThe set of all poles of $H(s)$ is $\\{1, -1\\}$. The pole at $s=1$ is unstable because it lies in the right-half plane.\n\n**Step 2: Construct D(s) to cancel unstable poles**\nThe factorization requires the relation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. To make $N(s)$ stable, $D(s)$ must be chosen to cancel the unstable pole at $s=1$ that appears in $H(s)$. Let's write out the matrix product:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be stable:\n*   $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ must be stable.\n*   $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$ must be stable.\n*   $n_{11}(s)$ must be stable. The term $d_{12}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ is unstable unless $d_{12}(s)$ has a zero at $s=1$.\n*   $n_{21}(s)$ must be stable. The term $d_{22}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ is unstable unless $d_{22}(s)$ has a zero at $s=1$.\n\nLet's make the simplest possible choice for $D(s)$. We can try a diagonal matrix. Let $d_{12}(s) = 0$ and $d_{21}(s) = 0$.\nThe conditions on $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$ become:\n*   $d_{11}(s)$ must be stable and proper. The simplest choice is $d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n*   $d_{22}(s)$ must be stable and proper, and must have a zero at $s=1$. A simple stable function with a zero at $s=1$ is $\\frac{s-1}{s+\\alpha}$ for any $\\alpha > 0$. Let's choose $\\alpha = 1$. So, $d_{22}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$.\n\nThis gives us our candidate for $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis matrix has a pole at $s=-1$, so it is stable. All its elements are proper. It is nonsingular.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the corresponding N(s)**\nNow we calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} (1) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (0) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & (1)(1) + (0)(0) \\\\ (0)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (\\frac{s-1}{s+1})\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & (0)(1) + (\\frac{s-1}{s+1})(0) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe poles of $N(s)$ are all at $s=-1$, so $N(s)$ is stable. All its elements are proper.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the coprimeness condition**\nWe must check that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (i.e., rank 2) for all $s$ in the RHP (Re(s) ≥ 0).\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc|cc} 1 & 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{array} \\right]\n\\]\nA potential loss of rank could occur where terms become zero. The only point in the RHP where this happens is at $s=1$. Let's test the rank at $s=1$:\n\\[\n[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc|cc} 1 & 0 & \\frac{1-1}{1+1} & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1-1}{1+1} & \\frac{2}{(1+1)^2} & 0 \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc|cc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\end{array} \\right]\n\\]\nThe two rows are $[1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1]$ and $[0 \\ 0 \\ 1/2 \\ 0]$. These two vectors are linearly independent, so the matrix has rank 2.\nFor any other $s$ in the RHP ($s \\neq 1$), the term $\\frac{s-1}{s+1}$ is non-zero. The second row starts with 0 while the first row starts with 1, which guarantees the rows are linearly independent.\nThus, the coprimeness condition is satisfied.\n\n**3. Careful Points**\n*   **Pole Identification:** The first and most critical step is to correctly identify all poles of the original system $H(s)$ and separate them into stable and unstable sets.\n*   **Stability of D and N:** Both $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be stable. This is achieved by ensuring $D(s)$ cancels the unstable poles of $H(s)$.\n*   **Properness of D and N:** All elements in $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be proper rational functions. The chosen forms satisfy this.\n*   **Coprimeness Check:** This is the final verification. It is essential to check that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$ in the RHP, especially at points where unstable poles or zeros of the system lie. Failure to do so might result in a non-coprime factorization.\n*   **Non-uniqueness:** The factorization is not unique. However, the derived solution is one of the simplest possible forms.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nA left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}, N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
