    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Information Needed:** The name of the specific US city he moves to.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Premise**\nFirst, it is necessary to confirm that the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, does indeed move to the United States in the film's plot. Tommaso is the best friend of the protagonist, Piero. A central theme of the movie is the contrast between their life paths after high school. While Piero remains in his hometown of Livorno, Tommaso seeks to escape the provincial life. Film summaries and analyses confirm that Tommaso does leave Italy to move abroad.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Relevant Plot Point**\nThe scene in question occurs towards the end of the film, after Tommaso and Piero have finished their final exams (*esami di maturità*). Tommaso, who comes from a wealthy family, announces his intention to leave Livorno because he feels stifled. He tells Piero about his plans to move.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific City**\nIn the dialogue during this scene, Tommaso explicitly names his destination. He tells Piero that he is moving to Philadelphia. This decision marks a major turning point and a divergence in the lives of the two friends, emphasizing the theme of different destinies shaped by social class and personal choice.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Character Identification:** It's important not to confuse Tommaso (the friend who leaves) with Piero (the main character who stays). The question correctly identifies Tommaso.\n*   **Source Confirmation:** The information that he moves to Philadelphia is a specific plot detail that can be verified through detailed synopses of the film, including those on reputable film databases and encyclopedias.\n*   **Thematic Significance:** Tommaso's move to a major US city like Philadelphia is thematically significant. It represents escape, opportunity, and a break from the traditions and limitations of their Italian hometown, which Piero continues to inhabit.\n\nBy following these steps and verifying the specific plot details of the movie *Ovosodo*, we can confidently identify the city.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
