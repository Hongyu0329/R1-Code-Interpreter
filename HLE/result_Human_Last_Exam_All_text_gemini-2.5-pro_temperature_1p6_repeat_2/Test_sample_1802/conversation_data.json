    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of several concepts in quantum information theory, including Pauli channels, complementary channels, and the rank of a channel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define a Qudit Pauli Channel**\n    A qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that maps a density matrix $\\rho$ acting on $\\mathcal{H}_d$ to another one. Its action is given by:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger $$\n    -   The operators $U_{ab} = X^a Z^b$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or discrete Weyl-Heisenberg operators), where $X$ and $Z$ are the shift and phase operators, respectively. These $d^2$ operators form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n    -   The coefficients $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ form a probability distribution, meaning $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ for all $a, b$, and $\\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Kraus Operators and the Complementary Channel**\n    From the definition of $\\Lambda$, we can identify its Kraus operators as:\n    $$ K_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab} $$\n    The Stinespring representation of $\\Lambda$ involves an isometry $V$ into a larger system including an environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is obtained by tracing out the principal system instead of the environment. A key result states that the rank of the complementary channel can be determined from the Kraus operators of the original channel.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rank of the Complementary Channel**\n    The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. For a channel $\\Phi$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_i\\}$, the Choi matrix of its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ can be expressed as a block matrix whose blocks are $(A_j^\\dagger A_i)^T$.\n    For certain classes of channels, including random unitary channels, there is a powerful simplification. A channel is random unitary if it can be written as $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k p_k V_k \\rho V_k^\\dagger$ for some unitary operators $V_k$. Pauli channels are a prime example of random unitary channels, as the Pauli operators $U_{ab}$ are all unitary.\n\n    For random unitary channels, the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is given by the dimension of the vector space spanned by the operator products of the Kraus operators:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{ K_{cd}^\\dagger K_{ab} \\mid \\forall (a,b), (c,d) \\}) $$\n    Let's compute the operators in this set:\n    $$ K_{cd}^\\dagger K_{ab} = (\\sqrt{p_{cd}} U_{cd})^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}) = \\sqrt{p_{ab}p_{cd}} U_{cd}^\\dagger U_{ab} $$\n    The product of two Pauli operators $U_{cd}^\\dagger U_{ab}$ is another Pauli operator, up to a phase factor. Specifically, $U_{cd}^\\dagger U_{ab} = \\phi \\cdot U_{a-c, b-d}$ (where subtraction is modulo $d$).\n\n4.  **Relate the Rank to a Combinatorial Problem**\n    Since we are interested in the dimension of the linear span, the non-zero scalar coefficients $\\sqrt{p_{ab}p_{cd}}$ and the phase factors $\\phi$ are irrelevant. The problem reduces to finding the number of distinct Pauli operators of the form $U_{a-c, b-d}$ that can be generated. The Pauli operators $\\{U_{ij}\\}$ are linearly independent.\n    Let $S$ be the support of the probability distribution, i.e., $S = \\{ (a,b) \\mid p_{ab} > 0 \\}$. The set of operators spanning the space is effectively $\\{ U_{s_1 - s_2} \\mid s_1, s_2 \\in S \\}$. The rank of the complementary channel is the size of the difference set of the indices:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = |S-S| = |\\{s_1 - s_2 \\mid s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}| $$\n    where the indices are treated as elements of the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$.\n\n5.  **Maximize the Rank**\n    The problem now is to find the maximum possible size of the difference set $S-S$, where $S$ is any non-empty subset of the group $G$. The choice of $S$ corresponds to choosing which Pauli errors occur with non-zero probability.\n    -   The difference set $S-S$ is a subset of $G$. Therefore, its size is bounded by the size of the group:\n        $$ |S-S| \\le |G| = |\\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d| = d^2 $$\n    -   To find the maximum rank, we need to check if this upper bound of $d^2$ can be achieved for some valid Pauli channel. This requires finding a support set $S$ such that $S-S = G$.\n    -   A simple choice is to take the support set to be the entire group, $S = G$. This is a valid choice, corresponding to a Pauli channel where every $p_{ab} > 0$. A canonical example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_{ab} = 1/d^2$ for all $(a,b) \\in G$.\n    -   If $S=G$, then for any element $g \\in G$, we can write $g = g - \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{0}$ is the identity element of the group. Since both $g$ and $\\mathbf{0}$ are in $S$, every $g \\in G$ is in the difference set $S-S$. Thus, $S-S = G$.\n    -   This means the rank is $|G| = d^2$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n-   **Generalized Pauli Operators:** The structure of the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators and the group they form under multiplication is central to the analysis.\n-   **Rank of the Complementary Channel:** The formula $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{ K_j^\\dagger K_i \\})$ is crucial. While its general applicability has subtleties, it is known to be valid for random unitary channels, which include all Pauli channels.\n-   **Maximization:** The final step involves a simple concept from additive combinatorics: finding the maximum size of the difference set $S-S$ of a subset $S$ of a finite group. The maximum possible size is the size of the group itself.\n-   **Achievability:** It's important to show that the mathematical maximum corresponds to a physically valid quantum channel. The completely depolarizing channel is a Pauli channel that achieves the maximal rank of $d^2$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is given by $|S-S|$, where $S$ is the set of indices corresponding to non-zero probabilities $p_{ab}$. The maximal possible size of this set is the size of the entire index group $\\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$, which is $d^2$. This maximum is achieved when all Pauli operators have a non-zero probability of occurring, as is the case for the completely depolarizing channel."
