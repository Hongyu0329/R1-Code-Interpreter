    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a Full CI calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)**\n\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We need to sum the electrons from each atom:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron. There are 3 H atoms, so $3 \\times 1 = 3$ electrons.\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons, N = $6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, K)**\n\nThe basis set is 6-31G**, which is also denoted as 6-31G(d,p). The `**` indicates that polarization functions (d-functions for heavy atoms, p-functions for hydrogen) are added to all atoms. We count the number of basis functions for each atom:\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G part gives two s-type functions (split valence). The `**` adds a set of three p-type polarization functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    *   Number of functions for H = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5.\n*   **Carbon (C):** A second-row atom. The 6-31G part provides 9 functions (a 1s core function, and two sets of s and p valence functions). The `*` adds a set of six d-type Cartesian polarization functions.\n    *   Number of functions for C = 9 + 6 (d) = 15.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** Also a second-row atom, same as Carbon.\n    *   Number of functions for F = 9 + 6 (d) = 15.\n*   **Silicon (Si):** A third-row atom. The 6-31G part provides 13 functions (core: 1s, 2s, 2p; valence: 3s, 3p split into two sets). The `*` adds a set of six d-type Cartesian polarization functions.\n    *   Number of functions for Si = 13 + 6 (d) = 19.\n\nTotal number of basis functions, K = (1 × C) + (3 × H) + (1 × Si) + (1 × F)\nK = 15 + (3 × 5) + 19 + 15\nK = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total spin (S)**\n\nThe molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ is a stable, closed-shell molecule. It has an even number of electrons (N=32). Its ground state is a singlet state, which corresponds to a total spin quantum number S = 0.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the formula for the number of CSFs**\n\nThe number of CSFs for a system with K spatial orbitals, N electrons, and total spin S is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n$N_{CSF}(K, N, S) = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{\\frac{N}{2} - S} \\binom{K+1}{\\frac{N}{2} + S + 1}$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the values and calculate**\n\n*   K = 64\n*   N = 32\n*   S = 0\n*   N/2 = 16\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{2(0)+1}{64+1} \\binom{64+1}{\\frac{32}{2} - 0} \\binom{64+1}{\\frac{32}{2} + 0 + 1}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$\n\nNow, we compute the values of the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{65}{16} = \\frac{65!}{16! \\cdot 49!} = 4,331,561,001,509,312$\n*   $\\binom{65}{17} = \\frac{65!}{17! \\cdot 48!} = 12,530,138,240,027,352$\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of CSFs:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\times (4,331,561,001,509,312) \\times (12,530,138,240,027,352)$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{54,275,463,704,285,888,896,255,021,811,200}{65}$\n$N_{CSF} = 835,007,133,912,090,598,403,923,412,480$\n\nThis number can be written in scientific notation as approximately $8.35 \\times 10^{29}$."
