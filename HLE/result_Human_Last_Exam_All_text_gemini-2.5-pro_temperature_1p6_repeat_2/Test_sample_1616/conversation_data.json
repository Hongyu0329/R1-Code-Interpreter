    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel became short when it was in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. For this rule to apply, a word's historical form must have had a long vowel in that position. We are looking for the word that does *not* follow this pattern.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Word Analysis**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Related word:** `south`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `south` has a long vowel (the diphthong /aʊ/, which developed from Middle English long /uː/). In the derivative `southern` (/ˈsʌðərn/), this vowel is shortened to /ʌ/. Although `southern` is a two-syllable word today, this is a classic example of pre-cluster shortening that operates on the same principle as trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It *has* undergone shortening.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/) has a long vowel (diphthong /aɪ/). In the four-syllable word `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), that same vowel, now in the antepenultimate syllable, is laxed to a short /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It *has* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `serene` (/səˈriːn/) has a long vowel /iː/. In the four-syllable word `serenity` (/səˈrɛnəti/), that vowel, now in the antepenultimate syllable, is laxed to a short /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It *has* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Related word:** `please`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `please` (/pliːz/) has a long vowel /iː/. In `pleasant` (/ˈplɛzənt/), the corresponding vowel is short /ɛ/. This appears to be an example of laxing. However, this shortening happened before the consonant cluster `-nt`, a separate rule, and likely occurred in Old French before the word was even borrowed into English. Still, it exhibits a pattern of shortening in a derived form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It *has* undergone a shortening process, even if the precise mechanism isn't trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related word (Latin root):** *grātus* (\"grateful\").\n    *   **Analysis:** The Latin root *grāt-* had a long vowel /aː/. In the three-syllable English word `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), the vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable and is short /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It *has* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Related word:** `shade`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This case is different. `shadow` comes from the Old English word *sceadu*. In this word, the vowel (`ea`) was already short. It was never long, so it could not be shortened (or \"laxed\"). The related word `shade` developed from a different form of the same Old English word where the vowel was lengthened later in history (a process called Open Syllable Lengthening). Therefore, `shadow` retained its original short vowel; it did not undergo laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has *not* undergone laxing because its vowel was never long to begin with.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nAll words except `shadow` show a shortening of a vowel compared to their root or related simple form. `shadow` is the only word in the list whose stem vowel was historically short and remained so. It did not have a long vowel that could be laxed.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
