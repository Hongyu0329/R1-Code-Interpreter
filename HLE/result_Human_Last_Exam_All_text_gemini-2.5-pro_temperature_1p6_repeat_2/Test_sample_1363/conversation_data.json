    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the dance where \"overturning\" a \"reverse turn\" is considered a fundamental technical error, meaning it's impossible to do without violating the core principles of that dance's technique.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in all five dances listed, which involves turning to the left.\n    *   **Overturning:** Turning more than the prescribed amount for a given step or figure. For example, turning 1/2 to the left on a step that is technically defined as a 3/8 turn.\n    *   **Disregarding the Technique:** This implies breaking a fundamental rule of the dance, not just performing a figure with less-than-perfect style.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Dance Style's Technique Regarding Turns:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:** These four dances are known as \"swing dances.\"\n        *   **Core Technique:** A key element in these dances is **Contra Body Movement (CBM)**, where the opposite side of the body turns towards the moving leg. This, combined with the swing of the leg and body, generates rotation.\n        *   **Turning Mechanism:** The turn is continuous and flowing, created by the pendulum-like swing of the legs and the coordinated rotation of the body.\n        *   **Overturning:** In these swing dances, overturning a figure is essentially an exaggeration of the natural turning mechanism. While a standard figure has a defined amount of turn for good balance and progression, a skilled dancer can intentionally turn more (or less) for choreographic purposes. It might be difficult, lead to poor alignment, or look uncontrolled if done poorly, but it uses the same fundamental mechanics as a standard turn. It is not, therefore, *impossible* without violating the core technique; it is simply a variation in the *amount* of an existing action (swing and CBM).\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** This dance is fundamentally different from the swing dances.\n        *   **Core Technique:**\n            *   **No Swing:** Tango technique does not use CBM or the pendulum swing of the legs to generate rotation in the same way. Movement is direct and sharp (staccato).\n            *   **No Rise and Fall:** Dancers maintain a constant, low center of gravity.\n            *   **\"Walking on Tracks\":** A foundational principle of Tango is that the feet do not cross the center line of the body. Imagine walking on two parallel railroad tracks; the left foot stays on the left track and the right foot stays on the right track.\n        *   **Turning Mechanism:** Turns in Tango are executed more like swiveling or walking around a corner. The body turns first, and then the foot is placed in the new direction. The turn is sharp and happens at the end of the preceding step, not continuously throughout the step.\n        *   **Overturning a Reverse Turn:** In a Tango Reverse Turn, the man steps forward on his left foot. To overturn this turn, he would need to rotate his body so much that his right leg would be forced to swing across the line of his left leg to take the next step. This action of the foot crossing the body's centerline directly violates the \"walking on tracks\" principle, which is a fundamental and defining characteristic of European Tango technique. Therefore, you cannot overturn a Reverse Turn in Tango without disregarding one of its most basic technical rules.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **\"Impossible\" is a strong word.** In this context, it means \"not possible while adhering to the established, correct technique of the dance.\" An unskilled person could certainly flail around and turn too much, but they would not be executing Tango technique.\n*   **Choreography vs. Technique:** In swing dances, advanced choreography often plays with the amount of turn. In Tango, such a variation would change the fundamental character of the movement and be considered technically incorrect.\n*   **Distinguishing Tango:** The key differentiator is the *mechanism* of turning. Swing dances use body rotation and leg swing. Tango uses a staccato \"turn and place\" action, with feet staying on their respective sides.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the European Tango is the only dance on the list where the fundamental technique (specifically, keeping the feet on parallel tracks and the absence of CBM-driven swing) makes it impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn without breaking a core rule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
