    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle and Canonical Forms\n\nThe problem asks to reduce the system to observer canonical form using duality. The principle of duality in linear systems states that the properties of observability of a system `(A, C)` are dual to the properties of controllability of the system `(A^T, C^T)`.\n\nSpecifically, transforming a system `(A, C)` to the observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` is dual to transforming the system `(A^T, C^T)` to the controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`. The resulting matrices are related by:\n*   `A_o = A_c^T`\n*   `C_o = B_c^T`\n\nThe structure of the observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` is determined by a set of integers called the **observability indices** `{nu_1, nu_2, ..., nu_p}`, where `p` is the number of outputs. By duality, these are the same as the **controllability indices** of the dual system `(A^T, C^T)`.\n\nThe crucial point is that the matrix `C_o` in the observer canonical form has a fixed structure that depends only on the observability indices. Therefore, our primary task is to find these indices.\n\n### Step 2: Define the System and its Dual\n\n**Original System (S1):** `x(k+1) = Ax(k)`, `y(k) = Cx(k)`\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nLet's denote the rows of `C` as `c_1` and `c_2`:\n`c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`\n`c_2 = [1, 1, 0]`\n\nThe system has `n=3` states and `p=2` outputs.\n\n**Dual System (S2):** `z(k+1) = A_d z(k) + B_d u(k)`\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Observability Indices\n\nThe observability indices `{nu_1, nu_2}` are found by checking the linear independence of the rows of the observability matrix `O`. The rows are taken in a specific order: `c_1, c_2, c_1*A, c_2*A, c_1*A^2, ...`. We select vectors one by one and add them to our set if they are linearly independent of the vectors already in the set, until we have `n=3` linearly independent vectors.\n\n1.  **Vector 1:** `v_1 = c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`. This is our first basis vector.\n    *   Linearly Independent (LI) set: `{[0, 1, 0]}`.\n\n2.  **Vector 2:** `v_2 = c_2 = [1, 1, 0]`. This is clearly not a multiple of `v_1`. So, it's independent.\n    *   LI set: `{[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]}`.\n\n3.  **Vector 3:** `v_3 = c_1*A = [0, 1, 0] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [2, 1, 1]`.\n    We check if `v_3` is a linear combination of `v_1` and `v_2`.\n    `a*v_1 + b*v_2 = a*[0, 1, 0] + b*[1, 1, 0] = [b, a+b, 0]`.\n    This cannot equal `[2, 1, 1]` because the third component is `1`, not `0`. Thus, `v_3` is linearly independent of `{v_1, v_2}`.\n    *   LI set: `{[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]}`.\n\nWe have now found `n=3` linearly independent vectors, so we can stop.\n\nNow, we count how many vectors associated with each original output row (`c_1` and `c_2`) are in our LI set.\n*   Vectors from the `c_1` chain (`c_1`, `c_1*A`, ...): We have `c_1` and `c_1*A`. That's 2 vectors. So, **`nu_1 = 2`**.\n*   Vectors from the `c_2` chain (`c_2`, `c_2*A`, ...): We have `c_2`. That's 1 vector. So, **`nu_2 = 1`**.\n\nThe observability indices are `{2, 1}`. (Check: `nu_1 + nu_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 = n`, which is correct).\n\n### Step 4: Construct the New Matrix C_o\n\nThe new matrix `C` (which we call `C_o` for the canonical form) is uniquely determined by the observability indices. For a system with `p` outputs and indices `{nu_1, ..., nu_p}`, the `i`-th row of `C_o` is a row vector with a `1` at the column corresponding to the start of the `i`-th state block, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nThe starting column for the `i`-th block is given by `1 + sum_{j=1 to i-1} nu_j`.\n\nIn our case, `p=2` and indices are `nu_1 = 2`, `nu_2 = 1`.\n\n*   **For the 1st row of C_o (i=1):**\n    The position of the '1' is at column `1`.\n    The row is `[1, 0, 0]`.\n\n*   **For the 2nd row of C_o (i=2):**\n    The position of the '1' is at column `1 + nu_1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    The row is `[0, 0, 1]`.\n\nCombining these rows, the new matrix `C` is:\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThis is the final answer. The duality principle confirms this structure because the dual `B_c` matrix in controller canonical form would be the transpose of this `C_o`, which is a standard structure for controller canonical forms corresponding to controllability indices `{2, 1}`.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
