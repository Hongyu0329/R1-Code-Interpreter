    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding:**\n    *   A surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code where physical qubits are arranged on a 2D surface.\n    *   Logical qubits are encoded in the non-local topological properties of this surface.\n    *   The number of logical qubits depends on the topology of the surface, specifically its boundaries and holes (which are also a form of boundary).\n\n2.  **Determine Qubits in a Single Patch:**\n    *   A single, standard, planar patch of surface code has an outer boundary. This boundary allows for the encoding of exactly **one** logical qubit. This can be visualized as one logical operator being a \"string\" connecting two opposite sides of the patch, and the other logical operator being a string connecting the other two opposite sides.\n    *   This serves as our baseline: a patch with zero holes encodes one logical qubit.\n\n3.  **Determine the Effect of Holes:**\n    *   When a hole is created within the patch, it introduces a new, independent internal boundary.\n    *   Each new boundary allows for the creation of a new, independent logical qubit. For a hole, one can define a logical operator that forms a closed loop around the hole, and a corresponding operator that is a string from the hole's boundary to the patch's outer boundary.\n    *   Therefore, each hole added to a patch increases the number of logical qubits it can store by one.\n    *   From this, we can establish a formula for the number of logical qubits ($k$) in a single patch with $h$ holes:\n        $k = 1 (\\text{from the outer boundary}) + h (\\text{from the holes}) = 1 + h$\n\n4.  **Interpret the Question's Configuration:**\n    *   The question specifies \"**two patches** of surface code **with two holes**\".\n    *   This phrasing most commonly means that the entire system consists of two separate patches, and the total number of holes across both patches is two. It does not typically mean that *each* patch has two holes.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits in the system is the sum of the logical qubits in each independent patch.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits:**\n    *   Let the first patch have $h_1$ holes and the second patch have $h_2$ holes.\n    *   From the problem statement, we have the constraint: $h_1 + h_2 = 2$. (Since holes must be integers, the possibilities are (2,0), (1,1), and (0,2)).\n    *   The number of logical qubits in the first patch is $k_1 = 1 + h_1$.\n    *   The number of logical qubits in the second patch is $k_2 = 1 + h_2$.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits in the system, $K_{total}$, is the sum:\n        $K_{total} = k_1 + k_2 = (1 + h_1) + (1 + h_2) = 2 + (h_1 + h_2)$\n    *   Substituting our constraint ($h_1 + h_2 = 2$) into this equation:\n        $K_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\n6.  **Address the \"At Most\" Clause:**\n    *   The question asks for the maximum number of logical qubits. We should check if the distribution of holes affects the total.\n        *   **Case 1:** One patch has 2 holes ($h_1=2$), the other has 0 ($h_2=0$).\n            $K_{total} = (1+2) + (1+0) = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n        *   **Case 2:** Each patch has 1 hole ($h_1=1$, $h_2=1$).\n            $K_{total} = (1+1) + (1+1) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits is 4, regardless of how the two holes are distributed between the two patches.\n    *   The \"at most\" may also serve to exclude suboptimal configurations, such as physically merging the patches, which would reduce the total number of logical qubits. For example, joining the two patches to form one large patch with two holes would result in only $1+2=3$ logical qubits.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number is achieved by keeping the patches separate.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe optimal configuration is two separate patches. The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch. Based on the formula $k = 1 + h$ for each patch, and the constraint that the total number of holes is 2, the total number of logical qubits is consistently 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
