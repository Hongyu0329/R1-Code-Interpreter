    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown in MLB\nIn Major League Baseball, there are two types of Triple Crowns: one for batting and one for pitching. The question does not specify which one, but the \"Triple Crown\" commonly refers to the batting achievement, which is rarer and more widely celebrated. Therefore, the primary analysis will focus on the batting Triple Crown winners.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead his league (American League or National League) in three specific offensive categories in the same season:\n    1.  Batting Average (AVG)\n    2.  Home Runs (HR)\n    3.  Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead his league in three key categories:\n    1.  Wins (W)\n    2.  Strikeouts (SO)\n    3.  Earned Run Average (ERA)\n\n### Step 2: List and Count the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nThe question \"how many ... winners\" asks for the number of unique players who have accomplished this feat. We will list the winners for each league and then sum the unique players.\n\n**National League (NL) Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\nThere have been **7 different players** who have won the NL Batting Triple Crown.\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n4.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n5.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925)\n6.  **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n7.  **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Rogers Hornsby is the only player to win the NL Triple Crown twice. So, it has been won 8 times in the NL by 7 different players.\n\n**American League (AL) Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\nThere have been **9 different players** who have won the AL Batting Triple Crown.\n\n1.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n2.  **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n3.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n4.  **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n5.  **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947)\n6.  **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n7.  **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n8.  **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n9.  **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Ted Williams is the only player to win the AL Triple Crown twice. So, it has been won 10 times in the AL by 9 different players.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Unique Winners\nTo find the total number of unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we sum the unique players from both leagues.\n\n*   Number of unique winners in the National League = 7\n*   Number of unique winners in the American League = 9\n*   **Total unique batting Triple Crown winners = 7 + 9 = 16**\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion and Answer\nBased on the analysis, there are 16 different players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n*   **Final Careful Points Summary:**\n    *   The term \"Triple Crown\" most often refers to the batting achievement.\n    *   The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (people), not the number of times the award has been won. While the feat has been accomplished 18 times, it was done by 16 unique individuals.\n    *   The most recent winner was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, breaking a 45-year drought.\n    *   For completeness, the Pitching Triple Crown is a separate achievement won by 19 unique pitchers.\n\nThe answer to the question \"How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\" is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
