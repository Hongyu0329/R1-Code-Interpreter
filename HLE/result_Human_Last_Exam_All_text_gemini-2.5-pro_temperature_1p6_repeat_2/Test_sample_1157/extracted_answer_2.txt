**1. Specific Procedures for Appropriate Management:**
*   **Immediate Management:** The first priorities are to manage the patient's systemic health and the acute trauma. This involves:
    *   An immediate referral to a physician to begin treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes.
    *   Prescription of systemic antibiotics to prevent infection in the open sockets and analgesics for pain.
    *   A thorough clinical and radiographic examination (including a panoramic x-ray) to rule out other facial or alveolar fractures.
    *   Gentle irrigation of the sockets with saline or an antiseptic rinse. Replantation is not an option due to the 28-hour delay.
    *   Suturing of the gums if necessary for patient comfort and initial healing.
    *   Taking an impression for an interim removable denture for aesthetics and space maintenance.
*   **Intermediate Management:**
    *   Delivery of the interim denture once initial healing allows.
    *   Monitoring the healing of the sockets and ensuring the patient is compliant with her diabetes management.
*   **Definitive Management (after 3-6 months):**
    *   Once healing is complete and her diabetes is better controlled (e.g., HbA1c < 7.0%), a definitive prosthesis is planned. Given the patient's medical and skeletal profile, the most appropriate option is a **Cast Metal Removable Partial Denture**.

**2. Cells of Interest:**
The key cells are those involved in wound healing, which are adversely affected by high blood sugar:
*   **Fibroblasts:** For collagen and connective tissue formation in the socket.
*   **Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts:** For bone formation and remodeling of the socket.
*   **Neutrophils and Macrophages:** As immune cells crucial for preventing infection, their function is compromised.
