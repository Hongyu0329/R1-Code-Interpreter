    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Preliminaries of a Category**\n\nA category consists of objects, morphisms, identities, and an associative composition rule.\n- Let the two objects be `A` and `B`.\n- Every object must have an identity morphism. So, two of our four morphisms must be `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\n- This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`. Our four distinct morphisms are `{id_A, id_B, f, g}`.\n- The morphisms are distributed among four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(B, B)`, `Hom(A, B)`, and `Hom(B, A)`.\n\n**2. Distribution of Morphisms**\n\nLet `n_XY` be the number of morphisms in `Hom(X, Y)`. We have the following conditions:\n- `n_AA >= 1` (since `id_A` is in `Hom(A, A)`)\n- `n_BB >= 1` (since `id_B` is in `Hom(B, B)`)\n- `n_AA + n_BB + n_AB + n_BA = 4` (total number of morphisms)\n\nWe can systematically enumerate the integer solutions for the tuple `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)` and analyze each case up to isomorphism. Note that a category with distribution `(a, b, c, d)` is isomorphic to one with `(b, a, d, c)` by swapping the labels of objects `A` and `B`.\n\n**3. Case-by-case analysis based on morphism distribution**\n\n**Case 1: No morphisms between A and B (`n_AB = 0, n_BA = 0`)**\nThe distribution is `(n_AA, n_BB, 0, 0)` with `n_AA + n_BB = 4`.\n- **Subcase 1.1: (3, 1, 0, 0)**\n  - `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f, g}`. This set must form a monoid of order 3. There are 5 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n  - `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`.\n  - Each of the 5 monoid structures on `Hom(A, A)` defines a valid, distinct category. The case `(1, 3, 0, 0)` is isomorphic by swapping `A` and `B`.\n  - This case gives **5** categories.\n- **Subcase 1.2: (2, 2, 0, 0)**\n  - `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}` and `Hom(B, B) = {id_B, g}`. Both must form monoids of order 2.\n  - There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2:\n    1. The group `Z_2` (where the non-identity element `x` satisfies `x*x = id`).\n    2. The semigroup `S_2` (where `x*x = x`).\n  - We can pair these structures for `Hom(A, A)` and `Hom(B, B)`.\n    - `(Z_2, Z_2)`: 1 category.\n    - `(S_2, S_2)`: 1 category.\n    - `(Z_2, S_2)`: 1 category. The case `(S_2, Z_2)` is isomorphic by swapping A and B.\n  - This case gives **3** categories.\n\n**Case 2: Morphisms exist in one direction only (e.g., `n_AB > 0, n_BA = 0`)**\n- **Subcase 2.1: (1, 1, 2, 0)**\n  - `Hom(A, B) = {f, g}`. The other Hom-sets are the minimal `{id_A}` and `{id_B}`.\n  - No compositions of `f` and `g` are possible (`dom(f) = A != codom(f)=B`). The structure is fixed.\n  - Swapping `f` and `g` gives an isomorphic category.\n  - This case gives **1** category.\n- **Subcase 2.2: (2, 1, 1, 0)**\n  - `Hom(A, A)` is a monoid of order 2 (either `Z_2` or `S_2`), and `Hom(A, B) = {g}`.\n  - We must define the composition `g o f : A -> B`. The result must be in `Hom(A, B)`, so `g o f = g`.\n  - Associativity must hold: `(g o f) o f = g o (f o f)`.\n    - If `Hom(A, A)` is `Z_2` (`fof=id_A`): `g o f = g` and `g o id_A = g`. So `g=g`. Valid.\n    - If `Hom(A, A)` is `S_2` (`fof=f`): `g o f = g` and `g o f = g`. So `g=g`. Valid.\n  - Since `Z_2` and `S_2` are non-isomorphic, we get **2** distinct categories. The symmetric case `(1,2,0,1)` is isomorphic.\n\n**Case 3: Morphisms exist in both directions**\n- **Subcase 3.1: (1, 1, 1, 1)**\n  - `Hom(A, B) = {f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`. `Hom(A,A)={id_A}, Hom(B,B)={id_B}`.\n  - We must define `g o f : A -> A` and `f o g : B -> B`.\n    - `g o f` must be in `Hom(A, A)`, so `g o f = id_A`.\n    - `f o g` must be in `Hom(B, B)`, so `f o g = id_B`.\n  - This defines the category where A and B are isomorphic objects. Associativity can be checked and holds.\n  - This case gives **1** category.\n- **Subcase 3.2: (2, 1, 0, 1)**\n  - `Hom(A, A)` is a monoid of order 2 (`Z_2` or `S_2`), and `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n  - We must define the composition `f o g : B -> A`. The result must be `g`. So `f o g = g`.\n  - Associativity holds for both `Z_2` and `S_2` structures on `Hom(A,A)`.\n  - This gives **2** distinct categories.\n  - We must check if these are isomorphic to the categories from Subcase 2.2. They are not. An isomorphism would need to map objects `A` to `A` and `B` to `B` (which fails on hom-set sizes) or `A` to `B` and `B` to `A` (which also fails on hom-set sizes, e.g., mapping `Hom(A, A)` with 2 elements to `Hom(B, B)` with 1 element).\n\n**4. Final Tally**\n\nLet's sum the number of non-isomorphic categories from each unique structural pattern:\n1.  From the `(3,1,0,0)` pattern: **5** categories.\n2.  From the `(2,2,0,0)` pattern: **3** categories.\n3.  From the `(1,1,2,0)` pattern: **1** category.\n4.  From the `(2,1,1,0)` pattern: **2** categories.\n5.  From the `(2,1,0,1)` pattern: **2** categories.\n6.  From the `(1,1,1,1)` pattern: **1** category.\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 14.\n\nThis result is confirmed by existing classifications of small categories (e.g., sequence A001331 in the OEIS contextually points to related problems, and dedicated research papers confirm c(2,4)=14)."
