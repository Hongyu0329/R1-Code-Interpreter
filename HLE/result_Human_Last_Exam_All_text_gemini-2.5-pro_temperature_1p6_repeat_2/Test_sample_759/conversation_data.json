    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges $e$ for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group of order 3.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints**\n\n*   **Simple, connected graph:** The graph has no loops or multiple edges, and there's a path between any two vertices.\n*   **$|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$:** The size of the graph's automorphism group is 3.\n\n**Step 2: Properties of an automorphism group of order 3**\n\nA group of order 3 is always cyclic, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. This means the group is generated by a single element, let's call it $\\phi$, such that $\\phi^3$ is the identity transformation, and $\\phi$ is not the identity.\nThe automorphism group is $\\{\\mathrm{id}, \\phi, \\phi^2\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Action of the automorphism group on the graph**\n\nThe automorphism group acts on the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$. This action partitions $V$ and $E$ into disjoint orbits. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3.\n\n*   **Vertex orbits:** Vertex orbits can have size 1 (a vertex fixed by all automorphisms) or size 3. A size-3 orbit is a set of vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ that are cyclically permuted by $\\phi$, i.e., $\\phi(v_1)=v_2, \\phi(v_2)=v_3, \\phi(v_3)=v_1$.\n*   **Edge orbits:** Similarly, edge orbits can have size 1 or 3. An edge $(u,v)$ is in an orbit of size 1 (it's a fixed edge) only if its endpoints $u$ and $v$ are both fixed vertices. (If $\\phi(u)=v, \\phi(v)=u$, then $\\phi$ has order 2, which is not in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$).\n*   The total number of edges $e$ is the sum of the sizes of the edge orbits. Thus, $e$ must be of the form $k_1 \\cdot 1 + k_3 \\cdot 3$, where $k_1$ is the number of fixed-edge orbits and $k_3$ is the number of 3-edge orbits.\n\n**Step 4: Systematically search for the smallest number of edges, $e$**\n\nWe are looking for the minimum possible value for $e$. Let's test small values.\n\n*   **e = 1, 2:** Cannot form a connected graph that isn't a single edge ($|\\mathrm{Aut}|=2$) or two edges ($|\\mathrm{Aut}|=2$). No 3-fold symmetry possible.\n*   **e = 3:** $e$ can be written as $3 \\times 1$. This would consist of a single 3-edge orbit. A connected graph with 3 edges can be a path $P_4$ ($|\\mathrm{Aut}(P_4)|=2$) or a 3-cycle $C_3$. The automorphism group of $C_3$ is the dihedral group $D_3$, which has order 6, not 3. Another possibility is the star graph $K_{1,3}$, whose automorphism group is $S_3$, also of order 6. So $e=3$ is not possible.\n*   **e = 4:** $e$ can be written as $1 + 3 \\times 1$. This implies one fixed edge and one 3-edge orbit. A fixed edge must connect two fixed vertices, say $u_1, u_2$. The 3-edge orbit must connect to these fixed points to ensure connectivity. For instance, connect $u_1$ to a 3-orbit of vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. This adds the edges $\\{(u_1,v_1), (u_1,v_2), (u_1,v_3)\\}$. The resulting graph has vertices $\\{u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ and edges $\\{(u_1, u_2), (u_1,v_1), (u_1,v_2), (u_1,v_3)\\}$. The vertices $v_1,v_2,v_3$ are leaves connected to $u_1$ and are interchangeable. The automorphism group for this graph is $S_3$, which has order 6. Thus, $e=4$ is not possible.\n*   **e = 5:** Cannot be written in the form $k_1 + 3k_3$. Not possible.\n*   **e = 6:** Can be $6=2\\times 3$. Two 3-edge orbits. Let's try to construct such a graph. A common approach is to take a structure with 3-fold symmetry, like a $C_3$, and add features. Attaching a single leaf to each vertex of $C_3$ gives a graph with 6 edges. Vertices on the $C_3$ have degree 3, leaves have degree 1. Any automorphism preserves these sets. The original $D_3$ symmetry is preserved, so the group has order 6. Other constructions with 6 edges, like $C_6$ or the triangular prism graph without the top/bottom faces, have automorphism groups of order 12. So $e=6$ appears not to be possible.\n*   **e = 7:** $e = 1 + 2 \\times 3$. One fixed edge and two 3-edge orbits. One might construct this with two fixed vertices $u_1, u_2$ and a 3-orbit of vertices $v_1,v_2,v_3$. The edges could be $(u_1,u_2)$, and then connecting both $u_1$ and $u_2$ to all $v_i$'s. This graph is $K_{2,3}$ plus an edge between the two vertices of the smaller part. Its automorphism group is $S_2 \\times S_3$, which has order 12. Not 3.\n*   **e = 8:** Cannot be written in the form $k_1 + 3k_3$. Not possible.\n*   **e = 9:** $e = 3 \\times 3$. Three 3-edge orbits.\n\n**Step 5: Construct a candidate graph for e=9**\n\nLet's try to build a graph with 3 edge orbits of size 3, such that we only have the desired 3-fold rotational symmetry. We need to introduce a \"twist\" to break reflectional symmetries.\n\nConsider a graph with two 3-orbits of vertices: $V_1 = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ and $V_2 = \\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$. Total $|V|=6$. The automorphism $\\phi$ acts as $\\phi(v_i)=v_{i+1}$ and $\\phi(w_i)=w_{i+1}$ (indices modulo 3).\n\nLet's define three edge orbits:\n1.  **Orbit 1:** A 3-cycle on the vertices of $V_1$. Edges: $\\{(v_1,v_2), (v_2,v_3), (v_3,v_1)\\}$. (3 edges)\n2.  **Orbit 2:** \"Spokes\" connecting $v_i$ to $w_i$. Edges: $\\{(v_1,w_1), (v_2,w_2), (v_3,w_3)\\}$. (3 edges)\n3.  **Orbit 3:** \"Twisted\" connections. Edges: $\\{(v_1,w_2), (v_2,w_3), (v_3,w_1)\\}$. (3 edges)\n\nThe total number of edges is $e = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9$. The graph is connected.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the automorphism group of the candidate graph**\n\n*   By construction, the rotational symmetry $\\phi$ is an automorphism. So $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| \\ge 3$.\n*   Let's check for other automorphisms, particularly reflections. A reflection would typically map some vertices to themselves while swapping others, e.g., mapping $v_1 \\to v_1, v_2 \\to v_3, v_3 \\to v_2$.\n*   First, let's determine the vertex degrees.\n    *   $\\deg(v_1)$: neighbors are $v_2, v_3$ (Orbit 1), $w_1$ (Orbit 2), $w_2$ (Orbit 3). So $\\deg(v_1)=4$. By symmetry, $\\deg(v_i)=4$ for all $i$.\n    *   $\\deg(w_1)$: neighbors are $v_1$ (Orbit 2), $v_3$ (Orbit 3). So $\\deg(w_1)=2$. By symmetry, $\\deg(w_i)=2$ for all $i$.\n*   Any automorphism must preserve the degree of vertices. So it must map the set $V_1$ (degree 4) to itself and $V_2$ (degree 2) to itself.\n*   Let's test a reflection, e.g., one that corresponds to swapping indices 2 and 3: $\\psi(v_1)=v_1, \\psi(v_2)=v_3, \\psi(v_3)=v_2$, and similarly for $w_i$. Let's see if $\\psi$ preserves edges.\n    *   Consider the edge $(v_1, w_2)$ from Orbit 3. Applying $\\psi$, we get $(\\psi(v_1), \\psi(w_2)) = (v_1, w_3)$.\n    *   Is $(v_1, w_3)$ an edge in the graph? Let's check our edge sets. The edges in Orbit 3 are $\\{(v_1,w_2), (v_2,w_3), (v_3,w_1)\\}$. The edge $(v_1, w_3)$ is not in this set.\n    *   Since this reflection does not preserve adjacency, it is not an automorphism. Similar checks show that no other reflectional symmetries exist.\n*   The only automorphisms are the identity, $\\phi$, and $\\phi^2$. Therefore, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$.\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\n\nWe have systematically eliminated all possible edge counts less than 9. We have constructed a simple, connected graph with $e=9$ edges that has an automorphism group of order 3. Therefore, the smallest such number of edges is 9.\n\n>>>9"
