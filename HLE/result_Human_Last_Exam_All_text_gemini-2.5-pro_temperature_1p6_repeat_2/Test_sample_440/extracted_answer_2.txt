The density profile \(\rho(z)\) of the gas mixture as a function of height \(z\) is given by:
\(\rho(z) = (c_A(0) M_A + c_B(0) M_B) - \left[ \frac{g}{RT}(c_A(0) M_A^2 + c_B(0) M_B^2) + \frac{2 c_A(0) c_B(0) g}{RT^2} (2 a_{AB} M_A M_B - a_{AA} M_B^2 - a_{BB} M_A^2) \right] z\)
where \(c_A(0)\) and \(c_B(0)\) are the molar concentrations of Gas A and Gas B at the bottom of the container (\(z=0\)).
Numerically, this evaluates to:
\(\rho(z) \approx 0.02027 - (1.753 \times 10^{-6})z\) (in SI units of kg/m\(^3\), with \(z\) in meters).
The first term is the density at the bottom, \(\rho(0)\). The second term describes the linear decrease in density with height due to gravity (ideal gas effect), which is slightly modified by the non-ideal interactions. The non-ideal correction to the slope is approximately \(-2.54 \times 10^{-11} \text{ kg m}^{-4}\), which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the ideal term and thus does not affect the slope to the number of significant figures shown.
