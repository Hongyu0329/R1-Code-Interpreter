    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question.**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **\"A single genus\"**: This implies that only one genus is known to have this characteristic, making the answer specific and unique.\n*   **\"Mushroom\"**: The subject is a fungus from the phylum Basidiomycota, which produces a fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body.\n*   **\"Distinctly blue spore print\"**: This is the key identifying feature. A spore print is a crucial diagnostic tool in mycology, and its color is a primary characteristic for identification.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the concept of a \"spore print\".**\nA spore print is the powdery deposit of spores obtained by placing the cap of a mushroom gill-side-down on a surface (like paper) and letting the microscopic spores fall. The color of this deposit is a stable and reliable feature for identifying mushroom genera. Common colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, olive, brown, and black. A \"blue\" spore print is exceptionally rare.\n\n**Step 3: Identify potential pitfalls and careful points.**\nIt is crucial to differentiate between several \"blue\" characteristics in mushrooms:\n*   **Blue-colored flesh:** Some mushrooms have blue caps or stems (e.g., *Lactarius indigo*). This is the color of the mushroom tissue itself, not the spores.\n*   **Blue staining/bruising:** Many mushrooms, especially in the family *Boletaceae*, turn blue when cut or bruised. This is a chemical reaction (oxidation of psilocybin or other compounds like variegatic acid) and has nothing to do with the spore color.\n*   **Blue spore print:** This is the color of the mass of spores themselves. This is the specific feature the question asks about.\n\n**Step 4: Research and identify the correct genus.**\nMycological literature and databases confirm that while most spore print colors are in the brown-to-white spectrum, there is indeed one genus famous for containing species that produce a truly blue spore print. This genus is *Entoloma*.\n\n**Step 5: Refine the answer and add context.**\nWhile *Entoloma* is the correct genus, it's important to note a nuance. The genus *Entoloma* is very large, and the vast majority of its species have a characteristic pink or pinkish-brown spore print (hence its family name, Entolomataceae). However, a small section or subgenus within *Entoloma* (often referred to as *Leptonia*) contains species that are the exception. Species like *Entoloma nitidum* and *Entoloma euchroum* are noted for their striking, sky-blue spore prints. Despite this internal variation, *Entoloma* remains the only *genus* known to contain species with this trait. No other mushroom genus has been documented to produce blue spores.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the findings.**\nThe analysis confirms that the color of a mushroom's flesh or its bruising reaction is distinct from its spore print color. The blue spore print is a rare and specific characteristic. The single genus that is known to contain species producing a distinctly blue spore print is *Entoloma*.\n\n***\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
