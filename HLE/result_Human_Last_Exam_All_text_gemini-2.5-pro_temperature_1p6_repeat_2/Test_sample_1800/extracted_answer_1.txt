There is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio; it is a range that depends heavily on the synthesis method and reaction conditions. However, typical optimal ranges are:
-   **For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction:** The optimal Ni content is generally found to be in the range of 5-15 wt%, which corresponds to a **Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 0.15 to 0.5**. This range provides a balance between having enough active Ni sites and preventing particle agglomeration.
-   **For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS):** The optimal concentration is typically lower, often expressed as 10-20 mol% of Ni doping. This corresponds to a **Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 0.1 to 0.25**, which is ideal for enhancing the redox properties of ceria without causing detrimental phase separation.
