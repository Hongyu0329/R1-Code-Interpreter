    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b\\sin t$. The value of $b$ depends on the interval of the parameter $t$. This creates a piecewise curve.\n\n*   **Part 1:** For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we are given $b=1$. The equations become:\n    $x = \\cos t$\n    $y = \\sin t$\n*   **Part 2:** For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we are given $b=5$. The equations become:\n    $x = \\cos t$\n    $y = 5\\sin t$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Geometry of Part 1**\nFor $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n*   These are the standard parametric equations for a circle. We can verify this by noting that $x^2 + y^2 = (\\cos t)^2 + (\\sin t)^2 = 1$.\n*   We need to determine the range of coordinates for this part. As $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n    *   At $t=0$, $(x,y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi/2$, $(x,y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi$, $(x,y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   Since $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$, which means $y \\ge 0$.\n*   This part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   For this part: The range of $x$ is $[-1, 1]$. The range of $y$ is $[0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Geometry of Part 2**\nFor $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n*   These are the parametric equations for an ellipse. We can see this by writing $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = (\\cos t)^2 + (\\sin t)^2 = 1$. This is an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of length 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of length 5 along the y-axis.\n*   We need to determine the range of coordinates for this part. As $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n    *   As $t$ approaches $\\pi$ from above, $(x,y)$ approaches $(\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n    *   At $t=3\\pi/2$, $(x,y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n    *   As $t$ approaches $2\\pi$ from below, $(x,y)$ approaches $(\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$.\n*   Since $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin t < 0$, which means $y = 5\\sin t < 0$.\n*   This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n*   For this part: The range of $x$ is $(-1, 1)$. The range of $y$ is $[-5, 0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Bounding Box for the Complete Figure**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for $x$ and $y$ by combining both parts. This will define the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:**\n    *   From Part 1, $x$ covers the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   From Part 2, $x$ covers the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n    *   The total range for $x$ is the union of these, which is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$, $x_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-coordinates:**\n    *   From Part 1, $y$ covers the interval $[0, 1]$.\n    *   From Part 2, $y$ covers the interval $[-5, 0)$.\n    *   The total range for $y$ is the union of these, which is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$, $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Smallest Enclosing Square and its Area**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square that \"outcircles\" or encloses this rectangle must have a side length at least as large as the larger of these two dimensions.\n\n*   Side length of the smallest enclosing square = $\\max(\\text{Width}, \\text{Height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n*   The area of this square is $(\\text{side length})^2$.\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Piecewise Definition:** It is crucial to analyze the curve in two separate parts based on the definition of $b$.\n2.  **Extrema:** Find the minimum and maximum for $x$ and $y$ over the *entire* curve, not just for each part individually.\n3.  **Bounding Box vs. Square:** The question asks for the area of the smallest *square*, not the bounding rectangle. The side of the smallest square is determined by the larger dimension of the bounding rectangle.\n4.  **Intervals:** Pay attention to open vs. closed intervals for $t$, but remember that the overall range for the coordinates is the union of the ranges from each part. The points $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$ are included from Part 1.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Maximum extent in x-direction: $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   Maximum extent in y-direction: $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n*   The side of the smallest enclosing square must be at least $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n*   The area is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
