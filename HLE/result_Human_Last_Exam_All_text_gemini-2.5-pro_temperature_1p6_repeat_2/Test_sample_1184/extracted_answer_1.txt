**1. Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit (forming the Alpha Binding Pocket):**
The following five residues in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the human Cavβ1 subunit are the primary hotspots for direct binding to the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the Cav2.3 alpha-1 subunit. All residue numbering is based on UniProt entry P54283 (CACNB1_HUMAN, isoform 1).
*   **Tyrosine 220 (Tyr, Y)**
*   **Methionine 302 (Met, M)**
*   **Valine 339 (Val, V)**
*   **Tryptophan 345 (Trp, W)**
*   **Tyrosine 393 (Tyr, Y)**

**2. Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of alpha-1 subunit (gating modulation):**
The following residues in the human Cavβ1 subunit are critical hotspots for modulating the gating behavior (e.g., inactivation kinetics, voltage dependence) of the Cav2.3 channel.

*   **N-terminal Palmitoylation Sites (crucial for modulation of inactivation):**
    *   **Cysteine 3 (Cys, C)**
    *   **Cysteine 4 (Cys, C)**

*   **GK Domain Surface Residues (involved in allosteric modulation):**
    *   **Lysine 358 (Lys, K)**
    *   **Lysine 360 (Lys, K)**
