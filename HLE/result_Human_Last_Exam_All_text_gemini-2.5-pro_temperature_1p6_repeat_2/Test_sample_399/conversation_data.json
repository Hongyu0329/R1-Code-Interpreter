    "**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can see that the variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated, so it is a separable equation.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\n\nTo solve this equation, we move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\nAssuming $x(t) \\neq 0$ (which is consistent with the initial condition $x(0) = -8$), we can divide both sides by $x^2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\n\nNow we integrate both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   The integral of the left side is: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The integral of the right side is: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these results and adding a constant of integration, $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\n\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation we just found:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Write the particular solution**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into our integrated equation to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Solve for $x(t)$ (optional, but good practice)**\n\nWe can solve for $x(t)$ explicitly. First, multiply by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nThen, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by -8:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{-8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1} $$\n\n**7. Find the value of x(1)**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution. Using the equation from Step 5 is slightly easier:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo combine the fractions on the right side, find a common denominator (which is 8):\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nNow, we solve for $x(1)$. Multiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nThe value of $x(1)$ is $\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
