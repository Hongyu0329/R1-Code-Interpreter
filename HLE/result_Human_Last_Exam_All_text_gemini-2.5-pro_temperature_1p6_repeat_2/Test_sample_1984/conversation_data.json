    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the differential equation:**\n    The given differential equation is a first-order autonomous ordinary differential equation:\n    $x'(t) = f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$\n\n2.  **Find the equilibrium points:**\n    Equilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\n    We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$:\n    $-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$\n\n    Factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n    $-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\n    Recognize that the quadratic term is a perfect square:\n    $x^{2} - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^{2}$\n\n    So, the equation becomes:\n    $-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0$\n\n    This equation has two solutions, which are the equilibrium points:\n    $x_1 = 0$\n    $x_2 = 1$\n\n3.  **Determine the stability of each equilibrium point:**\n    The stability of an equilibrium point $x_e$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at that point.\n    *   If $f'(x_e) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n    *   If $f'(x_e) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n    *   If $f'(x_e) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is needed.\n\n    First, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n    $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x)$\n    $f'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1$\n\n    Now, we evaluate $f'(x)$ for each equilibrium point:\n    *   **For $x_1 = 0$:**\n        $f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n        Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n    *   **For $x_2 = 1$:**\n        $f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n        Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x=1$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the stability of $x=1$:**\n    We examine the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    *   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1** (e.g., $x=1.1$):\n        $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011$.\n        Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means the solution $x(t)$ will decrease towards $1$.\n    *   **For $x$ slightly less than 1** (but still positive, e.g., $x=0.9$):\n        $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009$.\n        Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means the solution $x(t)$ will decrease, moving away from $1$.\n\n    For an equilibrium point to be stable, solutions on both sides must converge towards it. Since solutions starting just below $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. (It is a semi-stable equilibrium).\n\n5.  **Determine the value of m:**\n    The variable $m$ is defined as the number of stable equilibrium points.\n    From our analysis, only one equilibrium point, $x=0$, is stable.\n    Therefore, $m = 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final result:**\n    We need to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\n    Substituting $m=1$:\n    $1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThe final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
