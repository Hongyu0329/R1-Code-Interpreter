    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Technology:** Photoplethysmography (PPG).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Capturing \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **The Specific Question:** HRV is computed using a value measured *between heartbeats*. What is this fundamental value called?\n\n2.  **Understanding the Concepts:**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is the number of times your heart beats per minute (BPM). It's an average rate over a period.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is not the heart rate itself, but the measure of the *variation in time* between each successive heartbeat. A healthy heart doesn't beat with perfect regularity; there are slight, millisecond-level fluctuations in the intervals between beats. HRV quantifies this variation.\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval:** This is the key piece of raw data. It is the precise amount of time, usually measured in milliseconds (ms), that passes between one heartbeat and the next.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Concepts to the Technology:**\n    *   The question specifies **PPG**. PPG technology, often found in smartwatches and fitness trackers, uses light to measure blood volume changes in your capillaries. Each pulse of blood from a heartbeat causes a peak in the PPG signal.\n    *   To calculate HRV, we need to measure the time from one peak in the signal to the very next peak. This sequence of time durations is the raw data.\n    *   While Electrocardiography (ECG) is the clinical gold standard and measures the electrical R-peak of the heart's QRS complex (leading to the term **R-R Interval**), the underlying principle is the same for PPG.\n    *   The term used for the time between consecutive beats, especially in the context of both PPG and ECG, is **Inter-Beat Interval**, or **IBI**. For PPG specifically, it is sometimes called the Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI), but IBI is the more common and general term.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Answer:**\n    *   HRV is not a direct measurement but a set of statistical metrics (like SDNN, RMSSD, etc.) that are *calculated from* a series of beat-to-beat interval measurements.\n    *   The question asks for the name of the foundational value used in this calculation â€“ the \"value between heartbeats\".\n    *   This value is the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats.\n    *   This time duration is called the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguish Raw Data from Calculated Metric:** The question is asking for the name of the raw data point (the interval), not the final HRV metric (like SDNN or RMSSD) which is calculated from many of these intervals.\n*   **Terminology (ECG vs. PPG):** While \"R-R Interval\" is specific to ECG, \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is a more general term that applies to data from both ECG and PPG, making it a very safe and accurate answer.\n*   **The Role of IBI:** A series of IBI values (e.g., 810 ms, 795 ms, 825 ms, 800 ms...) is collected first. Then, mathematical formulas are applied to this series to compute the final HRV scores. The IBI is the fundamental input.\n\nBased on this analysis, the value measured between heartbeats to compute HRV is the Inter-Beat Interval.\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
