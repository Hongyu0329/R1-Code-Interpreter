    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the musical terms in the question.**\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key, built on the first note of the scale. It's represented by the Roman numeral 'I' in a major key or 'i' in a minor key. For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic chord is A minor.\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In the key of A minor, the fifth note is E.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This is the specific quality of the fifth chord. The question specifies a *minor* fifth chord. In a minor key, the standard dominant (fifth) chord is often major (V) to create a stronger pull back to the tonic. A minor fifth chord (v) is a less common, but distinctive, choice. So, in the key of A minor, the minor fifth chord is E minor.\n*   **Starts with a chord jump:** This means the progression from the tonic (i) to the minor fifth (v) must happen at the very beginning of the song, likely in the introduction.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the required chord progression.**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we are looking for a Beatles song in a minor key that starts with an instrumental or vocal passage where the first chord is the tonic (i) and the second chord is the minor fifth (v). A common example would be a song in A minor starting with the chord change A minor -> E minor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze candidate Beatles songs.**\n\nLet's examine the intros of some Beatles songs, particularly those in minor keys or with unique chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\":** In E minor. The intro progression is Em -> C. This is a i -> VI progression, not i -> v.\n*   **\"Michelle\":** The verses are in F minor. The opening vocal line (\"Michelle, ma belle\") uses the progression F minor -> C minor. This is a i -> v progression. However, the song technically *starts* with a solo instrumental guitar line played over just the F minor tonic chord before this progression occurs.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** In A minor. The main riff goes from A minor to E7 (a dominant seventh, not a minor chord). This is i -> V7.\n*   **\"And I Love Her\":** In C-sharp minor. The famous intro riff moves from F-sharp minor to C-sharp minor. This is a iv -> i progression.\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\":** This song from the album *A Hard Day's Night* is in the key of A minor.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) is **A minor**.\n    *   The minor fifth chord (v) is **E minor**.\n    *   The song begins with a beautiful, melancholic acoustic guitar introduction.\n    *   The very first chord played is A minor.\n    *   The second chord it immediately moves to is E minor.\n    *   Therefore, the song **starts with a chord jump from the tonic (A minor) to the minor fifth chord (E minor)**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n\nThe song \"I'll Be Back\" fits the description perfectly. Its instrumental introduction is defined by the immediate chord change from the tonic A minor to the minor fifth E minor. While \"Michelle\" also features this progression, it doesn't happen at the absolute start of the track; it follows a brief instrumental figure. \"I'll Be Back\" begins directly with the specified jump.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
