    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   The parent structure is \"benzamide,\" which is a benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N group.\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl\" indicates two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. So, we have a -C(=O)N(Et)2 group. This is the principal functional group, so it is at the C1 position of the benzene ring.\n    *   \"3-dimethylamino\" indicates a dimethylamino group, -N(CH3)2, is at the C3 position (meta position) relative to the amide group.\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n          C(=O)N(Et)2\n         /\n    (1)C----C(2)H\n       ||    |\n    H-C(6)   C(3)-N(Me)2\n       |    //\n    H-C(5)----C(4)H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step:**\n    *   **Reagents:** sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium), TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine), and THF (solvent).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base used to deprotonate a C-H bond on an aromatic ring. `TMEDA` is a bidentate chelating ligand that coordinates to the lithium cation (Li+), increasing the reactivity of the base and helping to direct the deprotonation.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In a DoM reaction, a functional group on the benzene ring, called a Directed Metalation Group (DMG), coordinates to the lithium reagent and directs the deprotonation (removal of a proton, H+) to the adjacent (ortho) position.\n    *   **Identifying the Site of Deprotonation:** Our starting material has two potential directing groups:\n        a.  **The N,N-diethylamide group (-C(=O)NEt2) at C1:** This is a very powerful DMG. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C6.\n        b.  **The dimethylamino group (-NMe2) at C3:** This is also a good DMG. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C4.\n    *   **Synergistic Directing Effect:** The C2 position is ortho to *both* directing groups. This is a case of a synergistic directing effect. The deprotonation will occur preferentially at C2 because the resulting aryllithium intermediate is stabilized by the formation of a stable five-membered chelate ring, where the Li+ ion is coordinated simultaneously to the carbonyl oxygen of the amide and the nitrogen of the amino group. The proton at C2 is also the most acidic due to the inductive effects of the adjacent substituents.\n    *   **Intermediate Product:** Deprotonation at C2 results in the formation of an aryllithium intermediate: 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Methyl iodide (CH3I).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The aryllithium species formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion at C2). Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbon at C2 will attack the electrophilic methyl group of CH3I in a substitution reaction, displacing the iodide ion (I-).\n    *   **Product Formation:** The lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, the reaction introduces a methyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   The structure of the final product is a benzene ring substituted with an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at C1, a methyl group at C2, and a dimethylamino group at C3.\n    *   The name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n\n*   **Identify all directing groups:** Recognize that both the amide and the amine are strong directing groups for ortho-lithiation.\n*   **Evaluate relative positions:** Notice that the groups are meta to each other.\n*   **Recognize synergistic effects:** The C2 position is ortho to both groups, making it the overwhelmingly favored site for deprotonation due to cooperative chelation and enhanced acidity.\n*   **Understand the two-step process:** The first step creates a nucleophile (aryllithium), and the second step provides an electrophile (methyl iodide) for it to react with. The net reaction is the replacement of H with CH3 at the most activated position.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide>>>"
