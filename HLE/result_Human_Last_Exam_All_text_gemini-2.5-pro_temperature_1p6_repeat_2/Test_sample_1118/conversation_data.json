    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping/being released from Gestapo (more accurately, SA) custody.\n*   **Question:** What object is he holding in his hand, and what is its symbolic meaning (resistance)?\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific artwork**\nThe painting in question is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe), created in 1933. This confirms the subject and year are correct.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the historical context**\nCurt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany. Following the Reichstag Fire in February 1933, he was arrested in March by the SA (the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing, a precursor to the Gestapo's full consolidation of power) and imprisoned in Hohnstein concentration camp. He was released later that year and painted this self-portrait. The context of painting after persecution by the Nazi regime is accurate.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the object in the painting**\nAs the German title \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" suggests, and as is clear from viewing the painting, the object Curt Querner is holding in his hand is a pipe.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the symbolism**\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis, and several points must be considered carefully:\n*   **The Grip:** Querner is not smoking the pipe. He is holding it firmly in his right hand, almost gripping it like a tool or a weapon. This is an active, deliberate posture, not a relaxed one.\n*   **The Gaze:** He stares directly and intensely at the viewer. His expression is not one of defeat but of defiance, scrutiny, and resilience. This intense gaze informs the meaning of the object he is holding.\n*   **Symbol of Resistance:** In the context of his recent imprisonment and the oppression of the Nazi regime, the pipe is interpreted as a symbol of his retained identity and intellectual freedom. It is a simple, personal, everyday object that represents his refusal to be dehumanized or broken by his captors. By holding it with such firmness and confronting the viewer with his gaze, he asserts his individuality and his inner strength. It becomes a symbol of quiet, steadfast, and personal resistance against the brutal force that tried to crush him.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the painting's title, visual content, and historical context, the object Curt Querner holds as a symbol of resistance is a pipe.\n\n<<<A pipe>>>"
