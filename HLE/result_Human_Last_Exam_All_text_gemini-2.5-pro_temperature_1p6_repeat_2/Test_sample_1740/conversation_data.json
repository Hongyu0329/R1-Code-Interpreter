    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** The `let-7` family of microRNAs (miRNAs).\n    *   **Organism:** Humans (`Homo sapiens`).\n    *   **Query:** The total number of family \"members\" identified \"to date\".\n\n2.  **Define \"Family Member\":** This is a critical point as the term \"member\" can be interpreted in two main ways in this context:\n    *   **A) Unique Mature miRNA Sequences:** This refers to the distinct, final, functional miRNA molecules (e.g., let-7a, let-7b). Multiple genes can sometimes produce the exact same mature miRNA.\n    *   **B) Precursor miRNA Genes:** This refers to the number of distinct genomic loci that are transcribed to produce pre-miRNA hairpins, which are then processed into mature miRNAs.\n\n    In molecular biology and genetics, when discussing a gene family, it is common to count the number of distinct gene loci. Seminal review articles on the let-7 family most frequently use this definition. We will proceed with this more specific and widely accepted definition.\n\n3.  **Identify and List the Members:** Based on authoritative databases like miRBase and established scientific literature, the human let-7 family consists of the following precursor miRNA genes:\n    *   **let-7a:** It is encoded by three separate genes (paralogs) at different chromosomal locations.\n        *   `let-7a-1`\n        *   `let-7a-2`\n        *   `let-7a-3`\n    *   **let-7f:** It is encoded by two separate genes.\n        *   `let-7f-1`\n        *   `let-7f-2`\n    *   **Other `let-7` members:** The following are each encoded by a single gene.\n        *   `let-7b`\n        *   `let-7c`\n        *   `let-7d`\n        *   `let-7e`\n        *   `let-7g`\n        *   `let-7i`\n    *   **`miR-98`:** This miRNA is consistently classified as a member of the let-7 family due to its high sequence and functional similarity. It is encoded by a single gene.\n        *   `mir-98`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number:** We sum the number of distinct precursor genes identified in Step 3.\n    *   From `let-7a`: 3 genes\n    *   From `let-7f`: 2 genes\n    *   From `let-7b, c, d, e, g, i`: 6 genes (1 each)\n    *   From `miR-98`: 1 gene\n    *   **Total = 3 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 12**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Genes vs. Mature miRNAs:** It's important to distinguish between the 12 precursor genes and the 9 unique mature miRNAs they produce (let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98). While there are 12 genes, `let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, and `let-7a-3` all produce the identical mature `let-7a` miRNA. The same is true for the `let-7f` genes. The question about \"members\" is most robustly answered by counting the genes.\n*   **Family Definition:** The core family is consistently defined as these 12 loci. Some broader definitions based purely on the \"seed sequence\" might include other miRNAs (like `miR-202`), but these are generally classified into their own families.\n*   **Up-to-date Information:** This number (12) has been stable for many years and is consistently cited in major reviews and databases like miRBase, establishing it as the current consensus.\n\nBased on the analysis of counting distinct precursor miRNA genes, which is the standard convention in the field, there are 12 members in the human let-7 family.\n\n<<<12>>>"
