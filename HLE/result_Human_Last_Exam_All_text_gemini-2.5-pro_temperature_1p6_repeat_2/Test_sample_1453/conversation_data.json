    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Coiled-Coils and the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more α-helices are coiled around each other. The sequences of these helices typically follow a seven-residue repeating pattern known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Core Positions (`a` and `d`):** These positions are crucial for the stability and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil. They are almost always occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (like Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine). These residues form a \"hydrophobic seam\" or core that drives the association of the helices.\n*   **Interfacial Positions (`e` and `g`):** These are often charged or polar residues that flank the hydrophobic core. They can form electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices, which contributes to stability and specificity.\n*   **Solvent-Exposed Positions (`b`, `c`, and `f`):** These residues are typically polar or charged and point outwards from the coiled-coil structure into the solvent.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to assign the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions to this sequence. The key is to find a repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues consistently fall into the `a` and `d` positions. Let's test possible registers. The most common hydrophobic interaction pattern involves residues at positions `i` and `i+3` or `i` and `i+4`. For a standard coiled-coil, the core residues at `a` and `d` are spaced as `a..d`, which corresponds to positions `i` and `i+3`.\n\nLet's look for a consistent `HxxH` pattern (where H is a hydrophobic residue).\nConsider the segment `...LKEI...`. The `L` at position 7 is hydrophobic, and the `I` at position 10 is also hydrophobic. They are separated by two residues (`K`, `E`), so they are at positions `i` and `i+3`. This is a strong candidate for an `a-d` pairing.\n\nLet's assign `L(7)` to position `a` and `I(10)` to position `d`. We can now map the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Sequence**:  G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G\n*   **Position**: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n*   **Heptad**:    c d e f g a b c d e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c\n\nLet's list the residues at the critical `a` and `d` positions based on this register:\n\n*   **Positions `a`:** Leu(7), Leu(14), Leu(21), Leu(28) -> **All Leucine (L)**\n*   **Positions `d`:** Ile(3), Ile(10), Ile(17), Ile(24) -> **All Isoleucine (I)**\n\nThis assignment is highly consistent, with all `a` positions being Leucine and all `d` positions being Isoleucine. This is the correct heptad repeat register.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Packing Efficiency (Knobs-into-Holes)**\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by how efficiently the side chains of the `a` and `d` core residues can pack together. This is governed by the shape of the amino acid side chains. A key distinction is between **β-branched** amino acids (Isoleucine, Valine) and **non-β-branched** ones (Leucine, Alanine).\n\n*   **Isoleucine (I):** Has a branch at its β-carbon (the first carbon of the side chain). This makes it bulky close to the protein backbone.\n*   **Leucine (L):** Has no branch at its β-carbon. It is bulky, but the bulk is further down the side chain.\n\nThe established rules for oligomerization based on core residue identity are:\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by having a β-branched residue at `a` and a non-β-branched one at `d` (or vice-versa). The classic example is GCN4 with **I at `a`** and **L at `d`**. The alternating steric profiles allow for efficient knobs-into-holes packing.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by having a non-β-branched residue at `a` and a β-branched one at `d`. Our sequence has **L at `a`** and **I at `d`**. In a trimer, the `a` residues pack against each other in the central core, where the flexibility of the non-β-branched Leucine is advantageous. The β-branched Isoleucine residues at `d` pack efficiently into the grooves provided by adjacent helices in this trimeric arrangement.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by having β-branched residues at both `a` and `d` (e.g., **I at `a`** and **I at `d`**). The steric bulk of two β-branched residues is too great for a dimer or trimer but can be accommodated in the larger core of a four-helix bundle.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Oligomeric State**\n\nOur sequence has:\n*   **`a` position = Leucine (L)** (non-β-branched)\n*   **`d` position = Isoleucine (I)** (β-branched)\n\nThis `L(a)` / `I(d)` pattern is a classic and strong predictor of a **trimeric coiled-coil**.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein sequence would be 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
