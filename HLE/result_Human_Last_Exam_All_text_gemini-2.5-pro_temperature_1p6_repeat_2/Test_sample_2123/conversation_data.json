    "This is a classic literary puzzle. Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's clues.**\n*   **Location:** The wide boulevards of Vienna. The most famous of these is the Ringstrasse (\"Ring Street\").\n*   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay. This implies the original text might not be Russian, or it could be a slight misstatement and the original text is indeed Russian. The key is that the phenomenon occurs within a Russian-language text.\n*   **Content:** The surname of an English poet appears in the description.\n*   **Goal:** Identify this surname in English.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific literary work.**\nThe question refers to a famous passage in the essay \"My Pushkin\" (\"Мой Пушкин\") by the Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva. The essay was written in Russian, so the phrasing \"in the Russian translation\" is a bit of a red herring; the key is that it's a Russian text.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the context within the essay.**\nIn the essay, Tsvetaeva recalls a childhood conversation with her mother. Her mother, noticing her daughter's thoughtful silence, assumes she is missing their recent trip to Vienna. She says (in Russian):\n\n*\"Все о Вене, о широких бульварах?.. Да, конечно, после венского **Байрона** наш Нерви мал.\"*\n\nA translation would be:\n\n*\"Still thinking about Vienna, about the wide boulevards?.. Yes, of course, after Vienna's **Byron**, our Nervi [the town they are in] is small.\"*\n\n**Step 4: Connect the name to the poet and the context.**\n*   The word used is **Байрон (Bayron)**, which is the Russian name for the famous English Romantic poet, **Lord Byron**.\n*   In this context, Tsvetaeva's mother is not referring to the poet literally. She is using his name as a symbol of Romantic grandeur, scale, and magnificence. She is essentially saying, \"After the grandeur of Vienna's boulevards...\"\n*   Linguists and literary critics also suggest a possible pun or sound association. The mother, being well-educated and speaking multiple languages, might be making a sophisticated play on a German phrase like **\"breite Ring\"** (wide ring/boulevard), which, when pronounced with a certain accent, could sound somewhat like \"Byron\".\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final answer.**\nThe surname that appears in the Russian text when describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is \"Байрон\" (Bayron). In English, this surname is **Byron**.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
