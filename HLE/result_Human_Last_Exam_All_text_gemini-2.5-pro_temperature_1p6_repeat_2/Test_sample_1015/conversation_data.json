    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core movement: Cambré Derrière**\nA cambré derrière is a fundamental ballet movement where the upper body bends backward from the waist. It requires flexibility in the spine, core strength for support, and coordination with the arms (port de bras) and head.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\nThe Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova, is known for its systematic and logical progression, emphasizing strength, precision, and harmonious coordination.\n*   **Principle:** Stability and control are paramount. The movement must be executed safely and correctly before expressiveness is added.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   The bend initiates from the upper thoracic spine (the upper back), with the dancer thinking of lifting their chest towards the ceiling.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** The hips are kept stable and square, directly aligned over the supporting legs/feet. There is a strong emphasis on *not* pushing the hips forward. This is to protect the lumbar spine (lower back) from compression and to build immense core strength. The pelvis acts as a stable base.\n    *   The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\nThe Balanchine method, or style, developed by George Balanchine, is characterized by its speed, musicality, and creation of dynamic, often angular, lines.\n*   **Principle:** The aesthetic often values speed, long lines, and a more \"off-balance\" appearance to create visual excitement.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   To achieve a deeper, more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine style encourages the dancer to **push the hips forward**, away from the vertical alignment of the feet.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** This forward displacement of the hips is the defining characteristic. It allows the torso to bend further back, creating a more extreme and visually striking line. While it can place more strain on the body if not done with proper muscular support, it is a key component of the Balanchine aesthetic for this movement.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods and evaluate the answer choices**\nBy comparing the two approaches, we can identify the primary point of divergence.\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in port de bras (Vaganova tends to be more rounded and classical, Balanchine can be more angular), this is not the most fundamental technical difference in the cambré itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the key difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and stacked vertically over the feet. Balanchine incorporates a forward push of the hips. This is a foundational, well-known distinction in the pedagogy and aesthetic of the two methods.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is often fast, a cambré is not inherently faster in the Balanchine method; it is a technical and stylistic difference that exists regardless of tempo.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend often seen in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the forward hip placement. The hip placement is the *cause* of the difference in degree, making it the more fundamental and precise answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** Like arm placement, head placement (épaulement) has stylistic variations, but it is secondary to the core body alignment dictated by the pelvis and hips.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most significant and defining difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the alignment and action of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
