    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n$d = 53599$\n$d = 7 \\times 7657$\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 589$\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$\nSo, the conductor is a product of four distinct odd primes.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Primitive Dirichlet Characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely factored into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $d$.\nSince $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, any character $\\chi$ mod $d$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\nIn our case, $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$.\n\nThe conductor of $\\chi$, denoted $C(\\chi)$, is the product of the conductors of its components: $C(\\chi) = C(\\chi_7) C(\\chi_{13}) C(\\chi_{19}) C(\\chi_{31})$.\nA character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ has conductor $p$ if it is non-principal (not the character that maps every element to 1) and conductor 1 if it is the principal character.\n\nA character $\\chi$ is *primitive* if its conductor equals its modulus. For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $d$, we must have $C(\\chi) = d$. This implies that each component character $\\chi_p$ must have conductor $p$. Therefore, each $\\chi_p$ must be a non-principal character. This is equivalent to saying the order of each $\\chi_p$ must be greater than 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Order of the Character**\n\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. The order of a product character is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components.\nLet $o_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. Then we must have:\n$\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$.\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component, $o_p$, must be a divisor of 6. Thus, $o_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}\\}$ must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\nAlso, the order of a character $\\chi_p$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\nLet's check this condition for our primes:\n-   For $p=7$, $\\phi(7) = 6$. Orders must divide $\\gcd(6, 6) = 6$.\n-   For $p=13$, $\\phi(13) = 12$. Orders must divide $\\gcd(6, 12) = 6$.\n-   For $p=19$, $\\phi(19) = 18$. Orders must divide $\\gcd(6, 18) = 6$.\n-   For $p=31$, $\\phi(31) = 30$. Orders must divide $\\gcd(6, 30) = 6$.\nThe condition is satisfied for all components.\n\n**Step 4: Combine Primitivity and Order Conditions**\n\nFrom Step 2, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, we need $o_p > 1$ for all $p$.\nFrom Step 3, for the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, we need $o_p$ to be a divisor of 6.\nCombining these, the order of each component character, $o_p$, must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Number of Component Characters for each Order**\n\nThe group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ (where $k | p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\nFor each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the group order $p-1$ is a multiple of 6. So we can count the number of characters for the required orders:\n-   Number of characters of order 2: $n_p(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n-   Number of characters of order 3: $n_p(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n-   Number of characters of order 6: $n_p(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four components $\\chi_p$, there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible choices of non-principal characters whose orders divide 6.\n\n**Step 6: Use Inclusion-Exclusion to Count the Final Number**\n\nWe need to find the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that:\na) For each $p$, the order $o_p$ is in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nb) $\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$.\n\nLet's use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\nFirst, count the total number of ways to choose a tuple of characters where each component $\\chi_p$ has an order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. Since there are 5 choices for each of the 4 components, the total number of such tuples is:\nTotal combinations = $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract the combinations where the lcm is not 6. Given the possible orders are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, the lcm can only be 2, 3, or 6. We must exclude the cases where the lcm is 2 or 3.\n\nCase 1: The lcm of the orders is 2.\nThis happens if and only if all component orders $o_p$ divide 2. Since $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means all orders must be 2.\nThe number of characters of order 2 is $n_p(2) = 1$ for each $p$.\nNumber of tuples where all orders are 2 is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nCase 2: The lcm of the orders is 3.\nThis happens if and only if all component orders $o_p$ divide 3. Since $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means all orders must be 3.\nThe number of characters of order 3 is $n_p(3) = 2$ for each $p$.\nNumber of tuples where all orders are 3 is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe two cases are disjoint. Therefore, the number of tuples where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 is $1 + 16 = 17$.\n\nThe final number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the lcm is not 6:\nNumber of characters = $625 - 17 = 608$."
