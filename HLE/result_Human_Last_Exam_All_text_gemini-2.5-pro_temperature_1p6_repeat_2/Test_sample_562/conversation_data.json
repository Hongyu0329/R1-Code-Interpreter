    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the character 謄.**\nThe kanji 謄 is a compound character with a left-right structure, also known as a *hen-tsukuri* (偏旁) character.\n*   The left side component (the *hen*) is **言**.\n*   The right side component (the *tsukuri*) is 滕 without the water radical (氵).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (bushu).**\nIn most kanji with a clear left-right structure, the left-side component serves as the radical, especially when it's a common radical that indicates the character's general meaning category. The component **言** means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say.\" The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" a concept clearly related to words and documents. Therefore, **言** is the radical of 謄.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the name of the radical based on its position.**\nWhen the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known by a specific name.\n*   The Japanese name for this radical form is **ごんべん (gonben)**.\n    *   `ごん` (gon) comes from the *on'yomi* (Sino-Japanese reading) of 言.\n    *   `べん` (ben) is a variant of `へん` (hen), the term for a left-side radical.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the radical's name into Hepburn romanization.**\nThe Hepburn transcription for ごんべん is **Gonben**. Following the capitalization pattern of the example provided (\"Onnahen\"), we will capitalize the first letter.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to recognize the character's overall structure (left-right) to correctly identify the radical's position.\n*   Knowing that the left-side part of a character is called a *hen* helps in finding the correct name for the radical.\n*   The meaning of the character often provides a strong clue to its radical. \"Transcribing\" (謄) is directly related to \"words\" (言).\n*   The final answer must be the Hepburn transcription of the radical's positional name, not just the name of the base radical (which would be 'iu' or 'koto').\n\nBy following these steps, we confidently identify the radical as 言 and its positional name as Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
