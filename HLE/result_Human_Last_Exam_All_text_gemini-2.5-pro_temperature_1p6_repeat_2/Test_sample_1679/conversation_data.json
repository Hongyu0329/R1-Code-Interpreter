    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific film that meets three criteria:\n1.  It must have won the **Academy Award for Best Picture**.\n2.  It must visually **depict a Luxor Obelisk** on-screen.\n3.  It must be the **first** film to meet both of the above criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks\nIt is crucial to know what a \"Luxor Obelisk\" is. There are two of them:\n*   **The first** remains in its original location in Egypt, standing in front of the Luxor Temple.\n*   **The second** was moved to Paris, France, in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde**.\nA film could depict either of these to satisfy the question's criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Search Strategy\nThe most effective way to find the \"first\" winner is to review the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first award in 1927/28, and analyze the setting and scenes of each film.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Best Picture Winners\nLet's go through the list of early winners and check their settings:\n*   **1927/28 - *Wings***: Primarily set on the Western Front during WWI and in the USA. While there is a brief scene in Paris, it does not feature a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **1928/29 - *The Broadway Melody***: Set in New York City.\n*   **1929/30 - *All Quiet on the Western Front***: Set on the Western Front from a German perspective.\n*   **1930/31 - *Cimarron***: Set in Oklahoma.\n*   **1931/32 - *Grand Hotel***: Set in Berlin.\n*   **1932/33 - *Cavalcade***: Set in London.\n*   **1934 - *It Happened One Night***: Set in the USA.\n*   **1935 - *Mutiny on the Bounty***: Set primarily at sea and in Tahiti.\n*   **1936 - *The Great Ziegfeld***: Set in New York City.\n\n*   **1937 - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This is the first strong candidate. The film is a biopic of the French writer Ã‰mile Zola and is set almost entirely in **Paris**. The plot covers the infamous Dreyfus Affair. Key events, such as Zola's trial, involved locations near the Place de la Concorde, and a pivotal scene depicting a mob attacking Zola's carriage is set in the Place de la Concorde itself. Therefore, the **Luxor Obelisk in Paris** is depicted in the film.\n\n*   **1938-1942**: Winners from this period (*You Can't Take It with You*, *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *How Green Was My Valley*, *Mrs. Miniver*) are set in the US or Great Britain, not Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1943 - *Casablanca***: This film is another confirmed candidate. While set in Morocco, it contains a famous flashback sequence in Paris. During this montage of Rick and Ilsa's romance, their car is shown driving through the **Place de la Concorde**, with the Luxor Obelisk clearly visible in the background.\n\n### Step 5: Comparing the Candidates and Reaching a Conclusion\nWe have identified two early Best Picture winners that depict the Paris Luxor Obelisk:\n1.  ***The Life of Emile Zola*** (Winner for 1937)\n2.  ***Casablanca*** (Winner for 1943)\n\nSince the question asks for the **first** winner, we compare their win dates. *The Life of Emile Zola* won the award for 1937, while *Casablanca* won for 1943. Therefore, *The Life of Emile Zola* is the earlier film and the correct answer. No earlier Best Picture winner is set in a location where a Luxor Obelisk could be depicted.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
