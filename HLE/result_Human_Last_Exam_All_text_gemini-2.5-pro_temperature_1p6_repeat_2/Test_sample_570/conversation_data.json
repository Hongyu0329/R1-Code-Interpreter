    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Formulate the Condition**\nWe are looking for a convex domain `K` in the plane with the minimum possible area, such that `K` has a non-empty intersection with every line `L_{p,q}` defined by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nLet `v = (p, q)`. The equation of the line can be written as `x · v = 1`. The set of vectors `v` is the set of all primitive integer lattice points, let's call it `Z_vis^2`.\n\nA convex set `K` intersects the line `x · v = c` if and only if the values of the linear functional `f(x) = x · v` for `x ∈ K` span across `c`. That is, `inf_{x∈K}(x · v) ≤ c ≤ sup_{x∈K}(x · v)`.\n\nLet `h_K(v) = sup_{x∈K}(x · v)` be the support function of `K`. It's a property of convex sets that `inf_{x∈K}(x · v) = -sup_{x∈K}(x · (-v)) = -h_K(-v)`.\n\nSo, for `K` to intersect the line `px + qy = 1`, with `v = (p, q)` and `c=1`, the condition is:\n`-h_K(-v) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(v)` for all `v ∈ Z_vis^2`.\n\n**Step 2: Reduce to Centrally Symmetric Domains**\nThe question does not require `K` to be centrally symmetric. However, we can show that the minimum area is achieved by such a domain.\n\nLet `K` be any convex domain satisfying the condition. The set of primitive integer vectors `Z_vis^2` is centrally symmetric: if `v = (p,q) ∈ Z_vis^2`, then `-v = (-p,-q) ∈ Z_vis^2` as well.\n\nThe condition on `K` must hold for both `v` and `-v`:\n1.  For `v`: `-h_K(-v) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(v)`\n2.  For `-v`: `-h_K(-(-v)) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(-v)`, which simplifies to `-h_K(v) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(-v)`.\n\nCombining the inequalities from these two conditions, we get:\n*   From `1 ≤ h_K(v)` and `-h_K(v) ≤ 1`, we get `h_K(v) ≥ 1`.\n*   From `1 ≤ h_K(-v)` and `-h_K(-v) ≤ 1`, we get `h_K(-v) ≥ 1`.\n\nSo, for any `K` that is a solution, it must satisfy `h_K(v) ≥ 1` and `h_K(-v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ Z_vis^2`.\n\nNow, consider the central symmetrization of `K`, denoted `K_s = (1/2)(K - K)`. The support function of `K_s` is `h_{K_s}(v) = (1/2)(h_K(v) + h_K(-v))`.\nUsing the conditions derived above:\n`h_{K_s}(v) = (1/2)(h_K(v) + h_K(-v)) ≥ (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1`.\n\nFor a centrally symmetric set `K_s`, the condition to intersect `x · v = 1` is `-h_{K_s}(-v) ≤ 1 ≤ h_{K_s}(v)`. Since `h_{K_s}(v) = h_{K_s}(-v)`, this simplifies to `h_{K_s}(v) ≥ 1`. This is exactly what we have shown for `K_s`. Therefore, if `K` is a solution, `K_s` is also a solution.\n\nBy the Rogers-Shephard inequality, `Area(K_s) ≤ Area(K)`. This means that the minimal area must be achieved by a centrally symmetric convex domain (centered at the origin). We can therefore restrict our search to such sets.\n\n**Step 3: The Dual Problem and Polar Bodies**\nFor a centrally symmetric convex domain `K`, the condition is `h_K(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ Z_vis^2`.\n\nLet's consider the polar body of `K`, defined as `K* = {y | x · y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`. `K*` is also a centrally symmetric convex domain.\nThe condition `h_K(v) ≥ 1` for a vector `v` means that `v` cannot be in the interior of `K*`. If `v ∈ int(K*)`, then `x · v < 1` for all `x ∈ K`, which would imply `h_K(v) < 1`.\n\nSo, the condition on `K` translates to a condition on its polar `K*`: the interior of `K*`, `int(K*)`, must not contain any primitive integer points.\n`int(K*) ∩ Z_vis^2 = ∅`.\n\nOur goal is to minimize `Area(K)`. The areas of a convex body and its polar are related by the Blaschke-Santaló inequality. For centrally symmetric convex domains in the plane, a sharpened version (Mahler's inequality) states:\n`Area(K) * Area(K*) ≥ 8`.\n\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we need to maximize `Area(K*)` under the constraint `int(K*) ∩ Z_vis^2 = ∅`.\n\n**Step 4: Maximizing the Area of the Polar Body**\nWe need to find the maximum possible area for a centrally symmetric convex set `B = K*` whose interior contains no primitive integer points.\n\nBy Minkowski's fundamental theorem on convex bodies, if a centrally symmetric convex set `B` in the plane has an area greater than 4, its interior must contain at least one non-zero integer point `v = (p,q)`.\nIf `int(B)` contains such a point `v`, let `g = gcd(p,q)`. The point `v' = v/g` is a primitive integer point. Since `B` is convex and contains the origin, the line segment `[0, v]` is contained in `B`. As `v` is an interior point, the segment `[0, v]` is contained in `int(B)`. Thus, the primitive point `v'` must also be in `int(B)`.\nThis would contradict our condition `int(B) ∩ Z_vis^2 = ∅`.\n\nTherefore, the area of `B=K*` cannot be greater than 4. `Area(K*) ≤ 4`.\n\nThe maximum area of 4 is attainable. Consider the square `S = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n*   `S` is a centrally symmetric convex set.\n*   `Area(S) = 4`.\n*   `int(S) = (-1, 1) × (-1, 1)`. The only integer point in `int(S)` is `(0,0)`, which is not a primitive integer point. Thus, `int(S) ∩ Z_vis^2 = ∅`.\nSo, the maximum possible area for `K*` is 4.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the Minimal Area**\nFrom `Area(K) * Area(K*) ≥ 8` and `Area(K*) ≤ 4`, we can establish a lower bound for `Area(K)`:\n`Area(K) ≥ 8 / Area(K*) ≥ 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\nThe minimal area is at least 2. To show that 2 is indeed the minimum, we must show that this bound can be achieved. We can construct a domain `K` that satisfies the conditions and has an area of 2.\n\nWe choose `K*` to be the area-maximizing square: `K* = S = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\nThe optimal domain `K` will be the polar of this square, `K = (K*)* = S*`.\n`K = { (x,y) | p x + q y ≤ 1 for all (p,q) ∈ S }`.\nThe supremum of `px + qy` over the square `S` is `|p| + |q|`.\nSo, `K` is the set of points `(x,y)` such that `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\n\nThis domain `K` is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. Its side length is `sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)`, and its area is `(sqrt(2))^2 = 2`.\n\nThis domain `K` was constructed from a valid `K*` and has area 2, which matches the lower bound we derived. Therefore, the minimal area is 2."
