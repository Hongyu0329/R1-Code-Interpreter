    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a Group**\n\nA group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set `G` and a binary operation `·` defined on that set. For `(G, ·)` to be a group, it must satisfy four fundamental axioms:\n\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of `a · b` is also in `G`. The problem statement assumes this by saying `·` is a binary operation *defined on G*.\n2.  **Associativity:** For any three elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There must exist an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`. This element `e` is called the identity element.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there must exist an element `b` in `G` (called the inverse of `a`, often denoted `a⁻¹`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest number of elements `n` in a set `G` for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that at least one of these axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) is not satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the possible values of n, starting from the smallest.**\n\nA crucial point in the definition of a group is the axiom of the Identity Element. It states that an identity element `e` *exists in G*. This implies that the set `G` cannot be empty. Therefore, the number of elements `n` must be a positive integer, i.e., `n ≥ 1`.\n\n**Case n = 1:**\n\nLet's see if a set with one element can be made into a non-group.\nLet `G = {a}`. There is only one element.\n*   **Closure:** To define a binary operation `·` on `G`, we must define the result of `a · a`. For the closure property to hold, the result must be an element of `G`. Since `G` has only one element, we must have:\n    `a · a = a`\n*   Now, let's check the other group axioms for the structure `({a}, ·)`:\n    *   **Associativity:** We need to check if `(x · y) · z = x · (y · z)` for all `x, y, z` in `G`. Since there is only one element, this simplifies to `(a · a) · a = a · (a · a)`.\n        LHS: `(a · a) · a = (a) · a = a`\n        RHS: `a · (a · a) = a · (a) = a`\n        Since LHS = RHS, the operation is associative.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need an element `e` in `G` such that `e · a = a`. The only candidate is `a`. Let's check if `a` works: `a · a = a`. Yes, `a` is the identity element.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** We need an inverse for each element. The only element is `a`, and the identity is `a`. Does `a` have an inverse? We need an element `b` in `G` such that `a · b = a`. Setting `b = a` gives `a · a = a`, which is true. So, `a` is its own inverse.\n\nSince all four axioms are satisfied, any set with one element and a binary operation must form a group (this is called the trivial group). Therefore, it is impossible for `(G, ·)` to not be a group when `n = 1`.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\n\nLet's see if a set with two elements can be made into a non-group.\nLet `G = {a, b}`. We need to find if we can define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` fails at least one of the group axioms.\nLet's try to construct an operation that fails the **Identity Element** axiom.\n\nDefine the operation `·` using the following Cayley table (multiplication table):\n\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | a |\n| b | b | b |\n\nThis operation can be described as `x · y = x` for all `x, y` in `G`.\n\nNow, let's check the properties:\n*   **Closure:** All entries in the table (`a` and `b`) are elements of `G`. The closure property is satisfied.\n*   **Associativity:** Let's check if `(x · y) · z = x · (y · z)`.\n    LHS: `(x · y) · z = (x) · z = x`\n    RHS: `x · (y · z) = x · (y) = x`\n    Since LHS = RHS for any choice of `x, y, z` from `G`, the operation is associative.\n*   **Identity Element:** We need to find an element `e` in `G` such that `e · x = x` for all `x` in `G`.\n    *   Let's test if `a` is the identity element. We would need `a · b = b`. But from our table, `a · b = a`. Since `a ≠ b`, `a` is not the identity element.\n    *   Let's test if `b` is the identity element. We would need `b · a = a`. But from our table, `b · a = b`. Since `b ≠ a`, `b` is not the identity element.\n\nSince neither element in `G` satisfies the condition for an identity element, this structure lacks an identity element. Therefore, `(G, ·)` is **not a group**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that for `n = 1`, any binary operation on a set of one element results in a group.\nWe have shown that for `n = 2`, it is possible to define a binary operation on a set of two elements that does not result in a group.\nTherefore, the smallest number `n` for which this is possible is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
