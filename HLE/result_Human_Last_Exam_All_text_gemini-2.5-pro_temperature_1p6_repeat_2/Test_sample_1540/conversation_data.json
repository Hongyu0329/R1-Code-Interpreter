    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory usage for its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe goal is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two input strings.\n- **Input:** Two strings of the same length (1 to 100 characters), each on a new line. The strings contain uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n- **Comparison Logic:** Lexicographical comparison, where letter case is ignored. For example, 'a' is treated as equal to 'A'.\n- **Output:**\n    - \"-1\" if the first string is less than the second.\n    - \"1\" if the first string is greater than the second.\n    - \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points for a Memory-Efficient Solution\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** The key is to normalize the case of characters before comparing them. The `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>` is perfect for this.\n2.  **Minimizing Memory:** The main constraint is memory efficiency. The standard approach is to use two character arrays, `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`, to store the inputs. This would consume `101 + 101 = 202` bytes for the strings alone.\n3.  **Optimization Strategy:** To save memory, we should avoid storing both strings if possible. Since the strings are on separate lines, we must read and store the first string completely before we can access the second one. However, we do not need to store the entire second string. We can read it one character at a time and compare it with the corresponding character from the already stored first string.\n4.  **Data Types:** We should use the smallest possible data types for variables to conserve memory. For a loop counter that goes up to 100, a `char` is sufficient instead of a 4-byte `int`.\n5.  **Input Reading:** The function `getchar()` reads a single character and returns it as an `int`. It is crucial to use an `int` variable to store the result of `getchar()` to correctly handle the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value, which might not fit into a `char`.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nBased on the points above, the most memory-efficient C program would be structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Declare a buffer for the first string:** We need to store the first string. Its maximum length is 100, so we need a buffer of size 101 to accommodate the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    - `char s1[101];` -> Memory usage: **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Declare a variable for the second string's characters:** We will read the second string character by character. As `getchar()` returns an `int`, we need an `int` variable.\n    - `int c2;` -> Memory usage: **4 bytes** (on a typical 32/64-bit system).\n\n3.  **Declare a loop counter:** We need an index to traverse the first string (`s1`). Since the string length is at most 100, the index will go from 0 to 99. A `char` type, which is 1 byte and can hold values in this range, is the most memory-efficient choice.\n    - `char i = 0;` -> Memory usage: **1 byte**.\n\n4.  **Program Logic:**\n    - Read the first line of input into `s1`.\n    - Loop, reading one character `c2` at a time from the second line of input.\n    - In each iteration, compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(c2)`.\n    - If a difference is found, print \"-1\" or \"1\" and terminate.\n    - If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal, so print \"0\".\n\n5.  **Total Memory Calculation (m):**\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all the variables declared in the program.\n\n`m = (memory for s1) + (memory for c2) + (memory for i)`\n`m = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 1 byte`\n`m = 106 bytes`\n\nThis approach is optimal because we cannot avoid storing the first string, and the other variables (`c2`, `i`) are using the smallest feasible data types for their purpose.\n\n<<<106>>>"
