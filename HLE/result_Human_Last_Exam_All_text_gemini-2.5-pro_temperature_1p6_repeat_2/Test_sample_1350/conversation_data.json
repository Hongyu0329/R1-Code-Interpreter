    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Content of Description:** The character describes the religious practices of the Romans.\n    *   **Specific Allusion:** The description clearly refers to the founding myth of Rome, involving Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Allusion:**\n    The myth of Romulus and Remus is central to the founding of Rome. The most iconic and widely recognized image from this myth is of the twin infants being nursed by a she-wolf (the Lupa Capitolina). A character unfamiliar with the story but who had seen a statue or carving of this scene would describe it literally: a wolf feeding two human babies. This would be interpreted as a form of wolf-worship.\n\n3.  **Examine the Characters and Plot of *The House of the Wolfings***:\n    The story revolves around a Gothic tribe, the Wolfings, preparing to defend their lands against a Roman invasion. The narrative requires a way to convey the nature of the enemy (the Romans) to the tribe and the reader. This is often done through a character who has firsthand experience with them.\n    *   **Thiodolf:** The chieftain of the Wolfings. His focus is on leading his people and his personal conflict with the magical hauberk. While he has likely fought Romans, the story does not position him as a traveler who has spent time within their cities observing their culture.\n    *   **The Hall-Sun:** A supernatural being (a valkyrie-like figure). She is not a human who would have toured a Roman city in the conventional sense.\n    *   **Otter:** A thrall (a slave or bondsman) who belongs to the Wolfings. His backstory, as related in the text, explicitly states that he had traveled widely, was captured, and spent time as a thrall in a Roman city before escaping. This makes him the most plausible candidate to have observed Roman life and customs from the inside.\n\n4.  **Locate the Relevant Scene in the Text:**\n    In Chapter IV, \"The Folk-Mote of the Wolfings,\" the tribe gathers to discuss the Roman threat. Various characters speak, and Otter is called upon to share his knowledge of the Romans.\n\n5.  **Analyze Otter's Speech:**\n    During the assembly, Otter gives a detailed account of his time among the Romans. He describes their city and their temples. Crucially, he mentions seeing a specific image in one of their holy places. He describes it as a bronze statue of **\"a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children.\"** He interprets this literally, telling the Wolfings that the Romans are \"sons of a wolf\" and that they \"worship the wolf and not the man.\" This is a direct and unmistakable description of the Romulus and Remus foundation myth, as seen through the eyes of an outsider who does not understand its context.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Character's Role:** The question hinges on identifying the character whose backstory uniquely qualifies them to provide this information. Otter's status as a former traveler and captive is the key.\n*   **Narrative Purpose:** Morris uses Otter's speech for exposition, revealing the Roman culture to the Goths. It also creates a powerful irony, as Otter describes the Romans' supposed wolf-worship to a tribe that is itself named \"the Wolfings\" and uses the wolf as its totem.\n*   **The \"Unreliable Narrator\" Aspect:** Otter is not unreliable in what he saw, but in his *interpretation*. He accurately describes the statue but misunderstands the myth behind it, which is how a reader recognizes the allusion while the characters in the book see it differently.\n*   **Textual Evidence:** The answer is not a matter of general interpretation but is based on a specific passage and speech within the book.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the character. It is Otter the thrall who, based on his experience as a captive in a Roman city, describes seeing a statue of a she-wolf suckling two infantsâ€”a clear reference to Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
