    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The question refers to one of Albert Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers from 1905. The specific paper on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen,\" which translates to \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat.\"\n\n2.  **Examine the Nature of Citations in the Paper:** In the early 20th century, academic citation practices were not as standardized as they are today. Papers often had few, if any, formal citations or bibliographies. Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion contains no formal list of references. The few references that do exist are typically in footnotes and refer to experimental observations (e.g., by H. Siedentopf and F. Siede).\n\n3.  **Look for Explicit Citations:** A careful reading of the original paper and its translations reveals that there is no explicit, formal citation to a specific book or published set of \"lectures\" by any theorist. Einstein develops his arguments from first principles, using well-known laws of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics (like Stokes' Law) without citing a specific textbook or source for them.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Paper's Title and Core Concept:** The key to answering the question lies in the paper's full title, which explicitly mentions the \"**Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat**.\" This theoretical framework, which posits that heat is a manifestation of the random motion of atoms and molecules, was the central theme of the paper. Einstein's goal was to show that Brownian motion was a directly observable consequence of this theory, thereby providing strong evidence for the existence of atoms.\n\n5.  **Identify the Key Figure Associated with the Theory:** The primary architect, champion, and synthesizer of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. His life's work was dedicated to developing and defending this theory against significant opposition.\n\n6.  **Connect the Figure to \"Lectures\":** Ludwig Boltzmann's most comprehensive and influential work on this subject is his two-volume book titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"** (in English, **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"**). This book was the canonical text on the subject.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Direct vs. Intellectual Citation:** It is a crucial point that Einstein did not include a formal, textual citation to Boltzmann's lectures. In fact, historical analysis by scholars like Abraham Pais suggests Einstein developed his statistical framework largely independently and was not deeply familiar with Boltzmann's work at that specific time.\n*   **Answering the Spirit of the Question:** However, Einstein's paper is fundamentally an application and a powerful confirmation of the very theory that Boltzmann had elaborated in his famous *Lectures*. The title of Einstein's paper is an undeniable reference to the framework established by Boltzmann. Therefore, while not a direct textual citation, it is an intellectual citation to the body of work most famously presented in Ludwig Boltzmann's lectures. In this context, Ludwig Boltzmann is the intended answer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the person whose lectures are intellectually and thematically cited is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
