    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*, with precise definitions of the key terms.\n\n**Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\"**\nIn the context of this question and Milton's 17th-century Puritan beliefs, a \"saint\" should not be interpreted in the Catholic sense of a formally canonized individual. Instead, it refers to any righteous, holy, or elect individual from biblical history. This includes patriarchs, prophets, and righteous kings who are presented as exemplars of faith and obedience to God. \"Historical\" distinguishes them from celestial beings like angels (Michael, Raphael) or the primal figures of Adam and Eve. The key criterion is that they must be mentioned **by name**.\n\n**Step 2: Methodical Search of *Paradise Lost***\nThe most logical places to find such names are in the invocation, scattered historical allusions, and most importantly, in the final two books (XI and XII) where the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision and narrative of future world history, which largely covers the Old and New Testaments.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying and Verifying Named Individuals**\n\nLet's list the figures from sacred history who are explicitly named in the text and fit the criteria.\n\n1.  **Josiah**: In Book I, while listing the pagan gods (fallen angels) worshipped by Israel, Milton notes their eventual fate: \"...Till good **Josiah** drove them thence to Hell.\" (Book I, l. 418). Josiah was a righteous king of Judah known for his religious reforms. He fits the criteria.\n2.  **Abel**: In Book XI, Michael shows Adam the first murder. He refers to the victim by name: \"...whereon **Abel** slaine / Ingesind the yet unpolluted ground...\" (Book XI, l. 459-460). As the first martyr, Abel is considered a saint.\n3.  **Enoch**: Michael describes the righteous man who \"walked with God\" and was taken to heaven without dying. While the description is long, the name is also present in the text shortly after: Michael says he will show Adam what comes next \"as I from **Enoch** have / His days lengthened...\" (Book XI, l. 705-706, textual note: syntax varies by edition but the name is present).\n4.  **Abraham**: In Book XII, Michael narrates the calling of the patriarch of the Israelites. He is explicitly named \"Abram,\" his original name: \"...from them, a man / I will select, and him my cov'nant make; / he is called **Abram**...\" (Book XII, l. 113-115). His name appears again later in the book.\n5.  **Joshua**: As Michael narrates the entry into Canaan, he names Moses's successor and explicitly connects his name to Jesus: \"**Josuah** whom the Gentiles Jesus call, / His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell / The adversarie Serpent...\" (Book XII, l. 310-312).\n6.  **David**: When describing the line of kings and the eventual coming of the Messiah, Michael refers to the great king of Israel by name: \"from **Davids** root a branch of noble stem / Shall spring...\" (Book XII, l. 348-349).\n\n**Step 4: Identifying Figures Mentioned by Allusion, Not by Name**\nThis is a crucial step, as many major figures are described or alluded to but not explicitly named. This distinguishes a careful reading from a superficial one.\n\n*   **Moses**: Referred to as \"that Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed\" (Book I, l. 8) and \"Amram's Son\" (Book I, l. 339), but the name \"Moses\" is never used.\n*   **Noah**: Described as the \"one just man\" who survives the flood and builds the Ark, but the name \"Noah\" does not appear in the text.\n*   **Solomon**: Described as \"that uxorious King, whose heart though large, / Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell...\" (Book I, l. 444-445), but the name \"Solomon\" is not used.\n*   **Mary**: She is referred to only as \"a Virgin\" (Book XII, l. 368). Her name is not mentioned.\n*   **John the Baptist**: He is clearly described as the forerunner who will \"point out the Lamb of God\" (Book XII, l. 359), but his name is not used.\n*   **The Apostles**: They are mentioned as a group (\"his Disciples\"), but none (Peter, Paul, John, etc.) are mentioned individually by name.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nBased on the careful textual analysis, which filters for figures who are both \"historical saints\" and are explicitly mentioned \"by name,\" the list consists of six individuals:\n1.  Josiah\n2.  Abel\n3.  Enoch\n4.  Abraham (as Abram)\n5.  Joshua\n6.  David\n\nTherefore, there are 6 historical saints mentioned by name.\n\n<<<6>>>"
