    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Primary Work and Context:** The question concerns the poem \"Sir Launfal.\" To find what it was \"preserved alongside,\" we must identify the original manuscript where the poem is found. The version of \"Sir Launfal\" in question is the Middle English romance written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century.\n\n2.  **Locate the Manuscript:** The only surviving copy of Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\" is located in a single, specific medieval manuscript. This manuscript is **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, currently held in the British Library.\n\n3.  **Define \"Book of Manners\":** A \"book of manners\" is a genre of text, also known as a courtesy book, which provides instruction on social etiquette, proper conduct, and courtly behavior. In Middle English, the term for \"courtesy\" is often spelled *curtasye*.\n\n4.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is an anthology, meaning it contains a collection of different literary works bound together. We need to examine the list of contents for this specific manuscript to find a work that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific \"Book of Manners\":** Upon examining the contents of Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, we find several famous Middle English works, including *La»ùamon's Brut* and *The Owl and the Nightingale*. Critically, it also contains a didactic poem on etiquette and household management. The title of this work is ***The Boke of Curtasye*** (The Book of Courtesy).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since both the romance \"Sir Launfal\" and the courtesy book *The Boke of Curtasye* are contained within the same physical manuscript (Cotton MS Caligula A.ii), they were preserved alongside each other. Therefore, *The Boke of Curtasye* is the book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Specificity of \"Sir Launfal\":** It's important to distinguish Thomas Chestre's Middle English poem from other versions, such as Marie de France's earlier lai \"Lanval,\" as they exist in different manuscripts. The context points to the English version in the Cotton manuscript.\n*   **Manuscript as a Collection:** Understanding that medieval manuscripts were often compilations or anthologies is key. Works were not published as standalone books in the modern sense but were copied by scribes into larger volumes with other texts.\n*   **Genre Identification:** Recognizing that \"book of manners\" corresponds to the genre of \"courtesy book\" is crucial for identifying the correct text within the manuscript's table of contents.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
