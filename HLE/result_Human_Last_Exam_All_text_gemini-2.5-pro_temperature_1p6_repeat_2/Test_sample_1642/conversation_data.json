    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number `m`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core constraint**\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number `m` of pairs of white and black queens that can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard such that no queen attacks another. The phrase \"without attacking each other\" implies a global condition: no two queens on the board, regardless of their color, can threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the problem by ignoring color**\n\nSince the non-attacking rule applies to all queens equally, the color of the queens is secondary. We can first rephrase the problem as: \"What is the maximum total number of queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board in a non-attacking configuration?\" Once we find this total number, we can then determine `m`.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the problem to the N-Queens Puzzle**\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem known as the N-Queens Puzzle. For a general `n x n` chessboard, we want to find the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on it.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Row/Column Limitation.** A queen attacks every square in its row and column. A 16x16 board has 16 rows and 16 columns. To place queens in a non-attacking manner, each queen must occupy a unique row and a unique column. By the pigeonhole principle, you cannot place more than 16 queens, as a 17th queen would have to share a row or column with a previously placed queen. Therefore, the absolute maximum number of queens is 16.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Existence of a Solution.** It is a known result in mathematics that for any `n x n` board where `n >= 4`, it is possible to place `n` non-attacking queens. Since our board is 16x16, a solution for placing 16 non-attacking queens exists. We do not need to find the specific placement, only to know that it is possible.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the maximum total number of queens**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, the maximum total number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard is 16.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the value of m**\n\nThe problem states that there are `m` white queens and `m` black queens. The total number of queens on the board is therefore `m + m = 2m`.\n\nWe have established that the maximum total number of queens is 16. So, we can set up the equation:\n`2m = 16`\n\nSolving for `m`:\n`m = 16 / 2`\n`m = 8`\n\n**Step 6: Final Verification**\n\n*   If `m = 8`, we have 8 white and 8 black queens, for a total of 16 queens.\n*   We know that it's possible to place 16 non-attacking queens on a 16x16 board.\n*   If we take any such valid placement of 16 queens, we can simply designate 8 of them as white and the remaining 8 as black. This configuration satisfies all the conditions.\n*   We cannot have `m = 9`, as that would require `2 * 9 = 18` queens in total, which is impossible to place on a 16x16 board without attacking each other.\n*   Therefore, the maximum value for `m` is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
