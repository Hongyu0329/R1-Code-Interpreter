    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This term refers to the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (a trait like height or disease risk) that can be explained by the combined additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typically measured in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or the *maximum possible* predictive power you could achieve if you knew the true effect size of every single SNP and could combine them perfectly. It is a property of the population and the set of SNPs.\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is constructed by summing up the number of risk alleles an individual carries across many SNPs, with each allele weighted by its *estimated* effect size. These effect sizes are estimated from a GWAS \"discovery\" or \"training\" dataset.\n    *   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (Variance Explained, R²):** This measures how well a specific PGS actually predicts the phenotype in a *new, independent* \"target\" or \"testing\" dataset. It is a measure of the *achieved* predictive power of that particular score.\n\n2.  **Compare Theoretical Limit vs. Achieved Performance:**\n    *   SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the **goalpost**. It's the total amount of variance that is potentially explainable by the SNPs.\n    *   The PGS predictive ability (R²) is the **score on the board**. It's what we actually achieve with our current methods and data.\n\n3.  **Identify Why Achieved Performance is Lower than the Theoretical Limit:**\n    The reason the predictive ability of a PGS (R²) is lower than the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) stems from several sources of imperfection inherent in its construction:\n    *   **Estimation Error:** The effect sizes used to build a PGS are *estimates* from a GWAS with a *finite* sample size. They are not the true, underlying effect sizes. This \"statistical noise\" or error in the effect size estimates means the PGS is an imperfect approximation of the true genetic value. This is the single most important reason.\n    *   **Incomplete SNP Coverage:** A PGS is often built using only a subset of all SNPs, typically those that pass a certain statistical significance threshold (p-value). This means it omits many SNPs that have real, but small, effects, which still contribute to the total SNP heritability.\n    *   **Differences in Populations:** The PGS is usually tested in a target population that may have different patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD), allele frequencies, or gene-environment interactions than the discovery population in which the effect sizes were estimated. This can reduce its accuracy.\n\n4.  **Consider the Limiting Case:**\n    Could the predictive ability (R²) ever equal the SNP heritability (h²_SNP)? In theory, yes, but only under perfect, idealized conditions that are never met in practice:\n    *   The GWAS discovery sample size would have to be infinitely large, so that the estimated effect sizes were perfectly accurate (i.e., had zero error).\n    *   The discovery and target populations would need to be identical in every relevant way.\n    *   The statistical model would need to perfectly capture the genetic architecture of the trait.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the word \"Necessarily\":**\n    Since any real-world study involves finite sample sizes, there will *always* be some degree of error in the effect size estimates. This error will *always* cause the predictive ability of the resulting PGS to be lower than the theoretical maximum defined by the SNP heritability. Therefore, the relationship R² < h²_SNP is a necessary consequence of using estimated, rather than true, parameters.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe statement is a correct description of the relationship between these two concepts. The SNP heritability sets the theoretical ceiling for prediction, and a polygenic score, as a practical predictor built from imperfect data, will have a predictive ability lower than this ceiling.\n\n<<<True>>>"
