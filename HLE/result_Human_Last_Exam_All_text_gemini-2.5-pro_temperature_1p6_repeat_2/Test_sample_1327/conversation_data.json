    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and look for simple patterns.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the differences between consecutive terms (first-order differences).**\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe differences are: 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no simple arithmetic pattern here.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a multiplicative relationship between terms.**\nLet's check if the next term `a_(n+1)` can be derived from the previous term `a_n` using a formula like `a_(n+1) = k * a_n Â± c`. Let's test integer values for `k`.\n*   Testing `k=2`:\n    *   `2 * 2 = 4`. `11 = 4 + 7`\n    *   `2 * 11 = 22`. `23 = 22 + 1`\n    *   `2 * 23 = 46`. `51 = 46 + 5`\n    *   `2 * 51 = 102`. `119 = 102 + 17`\n    The pattern is `a_(n+1) = 2 * a_n + c_n`, where the added sequence `c_n` is {7, 1, 5, 17}. This sequence does not have an obvious pattern.\n\n*   Testing `k=3`:\n    *   `3 * 2 = 6`. `11 = 6 + 5`\n    *   `3 * 11 = 33`. `23 = 33 - 10`\n    *   `3 * 23 = 69`. `51 = 69 - 18`\n    *   `3 * 51 = 153`. `119 = 153 - 34`\nThe pattern here seems to be `a_(n+1) = 3 * a_n - d_n`, where `d_n` is the sequence of subtracted numbers (starting from the second operation). The sequence of operations is `+5, -10, -18, -34`. Let's analyze the absolute values of these numbers: {5, 10, 18, 34}. Let's call this sequence `d_n`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the sequence of subtracted numbers `d_n`.**\nThe sequence `d_n` is {5, 10, 18, 34}. Let's find the differences between the terms of this new sequence.\n*   10 - 5 = 5\n*   18 - 10 = 8\n*   34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences of `d_n` are {5, 8, 16}.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the pattern in the differences of `d_n`.**\nThe sequence {5, 8, 16} has a clear pattern after the first term. The terms are being multiplied by 2 (`8 * 2 = 16`). It is reasonable to assume this pattern continues. The first term `5` can be considered an initial condition, or it can be analyzed further (e.g., `8 = 2^3`, `16 = 2^4`, so `5` could be a slight variation like `2^2+1`). Regardless, the strong `*2` pattern is the key.\n\n**Step 6: Predict the next term in this difference sequence.**\nThe next term should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n\n**Step 7: Use this result to find the next term in the sequence `d_n`.**\nThe next term `d_5` will be the previous term `d_4` plus the difference we just found.\n*   `d_5 = d_4 + 32 = 34 + 32 = 66`.\n\n**Step 8: Use `d_5` to find the next term in the original sequence.**\nThe pattern for the original sequence was `a_(n+1) = 3 * a_n` followed by an operation. The operations were `+5, -10, -18, -34`. The next number in the pattern to be subtracted is `d_5 = 66`.\n*   The next term, `a_6`, is `3 * a_5 - d_5`.\n*   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n*   `a_6 = 357 - 66`\n*   `a_6 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
