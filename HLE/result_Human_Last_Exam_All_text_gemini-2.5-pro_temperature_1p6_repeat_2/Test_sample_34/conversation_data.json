    "This question is asking for the hand at the very bottom of the suited Jack section of a standard Button opening range. Let's break down the factors involved.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Position:** The Button (BTN) is the most powerful preflop position. You are guaranteed to act last on all subsequent streets (flop, turn, river). This positional advantage allows you to open a very wide range of hands profitably, as you can realize your equity more effectively than your opponents in the blinds.\n\n2.  **Game Conditions:** 100 Big Blinds deep in a rake-free cash game. The rake-free environment is a key detail. Rake punishes small pots, slightly discouraging the opening of marginal hands. Without rake, the profitability of opening your entire intended range increases, meaning you can comfortably open even the weakest hands in a standard range.\n\n3.  **Hand Category:** We are analyzing suited Jacks (Jxs). These hands always have the potential to make a flush. Their value is further determined by the rank of the second card, which affects top pair strength, straight potential, and domination factors.\n\n4.  **Ranking the Suited Jacks:**\n    *   **Premium Suited Jacks (AJs, KJs, QJs):** These are extremely strong hands that make strong top pairs with good kickers.\n    *   **Strong Suited Connectors/Gappers (JTs, J9s, J8s):** These hands have excellent straight and flush potential. JTs is a premium connector, while J9s and J8s are strong one-gap and two-gap connectors. They play very well postflop.\n    *   **Marginal Suited Jacks (J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s):** As the kicker gets lower, the hand's value decreases.\n        *   **Kicker Problem:** Flopping a Jack with a low kicker (e.g., J2s on a J-8-4 flop) puts you in a difficult spot against any opponent who also has a Jack with a better kicker.\n        *   **Connectivity:** The primary difference between these lower suited Jacks is their straight potential. J7s is a three-gapper. J5s can make a wheel-straight (A-2-3-4-5). J2s has virtually no straight potential, as it cannot make an open-ended straight draw by itself. It relies almost exclusively on its flush potential or taking the pot down preflop.\n\n5.  **Determining the \"Worst\" Hand to Open:** Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers have shown that in a typical 100BB game, it is profitable to open every single suited Jack from the button. The combination of fold equity (the blinds folding to your raise), positional advantage, and the raw equity of a suited hand makes even the weakest combinations profitable opens.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since a standard, fundamentally sound strategy is to open all suited Jacks from the button (J2s and better), the \"worst\" one that you *should* still open is the one at the very bottom of the list. This hand is Jack-Two suited. It has the lowest kicker and the worst connectivity of all the suited Jacks.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   The question asks what you *should* open, implying it is a profitable play.\n*   The button position is crucial; this hand would be a fold from almost any other position.\n*   The rake-free nature of the game solidifies the decision to open wider, making a marginal hand like J2s a clear open-raise.\n*   The \"worst\" refers to the hand with the lowest Expected Value (EV) among all suited Jacks that are profitable opens.\n\nTherefore, the weakest suited Jack that should be included in a button opening range is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
