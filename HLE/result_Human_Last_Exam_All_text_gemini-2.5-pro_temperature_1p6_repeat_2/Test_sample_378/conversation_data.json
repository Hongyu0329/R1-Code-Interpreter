    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria.\n2.  **Identify the Core Claim:** The question claims that at some point, Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n3.  **Task:** The task is to find the specific year this public identification happened.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Official Name Verification:** The first and most crucial step is to verify Goodluck Jonathan's full and official name. All credible sources, including his official biography, academic records, and government documents, list his name as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his birth name or his officially recognized name.\n2.  **Search for Evidence of Name Change or Adoption:** The next step is to investigate if he ever legally changed his name or informally adopted \"Azikiwe\" as part of his public identity. This would involve searching for official announcements, news reports from reputable media, or statements from his office or campaign.\n3.  **Investigating the Origin of the Claim:** A search for \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" often leads to forums, social media posts, and less reliable websites where this name is used. This indicates that the claim exists primarily as a rumor or a piece of misinformation that was prominent during his political career, especially around the 2011 presidential election.\n4.  **Analyzing the Rumor's Motivation:** The rumor likely started as a political strategy or smear campaign. By adding \"Azikiwe,\" a name highly revered in Nigeria (belonging to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President), the rumor could have been intended to either falsely boost his appeal among certain ethnic groups or to paint him as politically opportunistic.\n5.  **Conclusion from Evidence:** There is no credible or verifiable evidence from any reputable source (such as the BBC, Reuters, Associated Press, major Nigerian newspapers, or official government records) to support the claim that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe,\" adopted the name, or added it to his own.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all available credible information, the premise of the question is incorrect. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". This was a widespread rumor that has been debunked. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that never occurred.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" originated from a popular but false rumor.>>>"
