    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and key figures.**\nThe question concerns the military campaigns of Ming dynasty General Mu Sheng (known as Mộc Thạnh in Vietnamese) in Vietnam during the early 15th century. This period corresponds to the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427), led by the Vietnamese leader Lê Lợi against Ming rule.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"first major defeat.\"**\nA \"major defeat\" implies a significant strategic failure, not just a temporary tactical loss in a single battle that was later reversed. It typically involves the failure of a campaign's objectives, the neutralization of an army, and/or a disorderly retreat with heavy casualties. We must find the first event in Mu Sheng's career in Vietnam that fits this description.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mu Sheng's campaigns in Vietnam.**\n*   **Initial Conquest (1406-1407):** Mu Sheng was part of the initial Ming invasion that successfully conquered Vietnam and overthrew the Hồ dynasty. This campaign was a victory.\n*   **Suppressing Rebellions (1407-1414):** Mu Sheng was involved in fighting against rebellions by Trần dynasty loyalists. While the Ming forces sometimes suffered setbacks in individual battles (like the Battle of Bô Cô in 1409), they were ultimately victorious in crushing these rebellions. These earlier battles do not constitute a major strategic defeat for Mu Sheng's overall command.\n*   **The Lam Sơn Uprising (1427 Campaign):** This is the most critical period. In 1427, the Ming Emperor sent a massive two-pronged relief expedition to save the besieged Ming forces in Vietnam. One army was led by Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng), and the other was led by Mu Sheng. This campaign was Mu Sheng's most significant command role against Lê Lợi's forces.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the location and circumstances of the defeat.**\n*   Liu Sheng's army was completely ambushed and destroyed at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang.\n*   Simultaneously, Mu Sheng was leading his army from Yunnan down the Red River (Sông Hồng) valley to converge with Liu Sheng.\n*   Lê Lợi anticipated this and dispatched a Vietnamese army under the command of generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả to intercept Mu Sheng.\n*   The Vietnamese forces successfully blocked Mu Sheng's advance at a series of strategic chokepoints, including the passes of Lãnh Câu and Lê Hoa, and at Đan Xá.\n*   Unable to break through, Mu Sheng's army was halted and forced to dig in, building a large fortified camp at a place called **Điêu Diêu**. Here, his army was effectively pinned down and neutralized, unable to achieve its objective of linking up with other Ming forces.\n*   Upon receiving news of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, Mu Sheng's army lost all morale. He ordered a retreat, but the Vietnamese forces pursued and attacked his fleeing army, inflicting enormous casualties.\n*   This complete strategic failure—being stopped cold, rendered impotent, and forced into a disastrous retreat—unequivocally qualifies as Mu Sheng's first *major* defeat.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the modern Vietnamese province.**\nHistorical sources and geographical analysis place the key locations of this event—the citadel of **Điêu Diêu** where Mu Sheng's army was trapped, and the surrounding passes like Lãnh Câu—within the territory of modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile Mu Sheng may have experienced minor setbacks earlier, his first major strategic defeat occurred during the 1427 campaign when his army was blocked, neutralized, and ultimately forced into a catastrophic retreat by Vietnamese forces under Lê Lợi's command. The primary location of this standoff was in modern Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
