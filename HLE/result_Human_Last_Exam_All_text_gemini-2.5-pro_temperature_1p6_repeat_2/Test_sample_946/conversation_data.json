    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific fictional singer from a particular episode of an online cartoon.\n*   **Cartoon Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n*   **Event in Episode:** The Junior prom\n*   **Performer Type:** A cardboard cutout\n*   **Information to Find:** The name of the fictional singer the cutout represents.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThis episode focuses on the four main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) getting ready for and attending their Junior prom.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the scene with the musical performance.**\nDuring the prom scene, Cheerleader gets excited about the musical guest. Her dialogue is a key clue. She exclaims, \"OMG! They got Thompkins for prom!\"\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the visual information presented on screen.**\nThe scene cuts to the stage, where there is a crudely drawn cardboard cutout of a singer holding a guitar. Above the cutout, a sign is visible.\n\n**Step 5: Read the name on the sign.**\nThe sign on the stage clearly identifies the performer as \"CARDBOARD THOMPKINS\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question asks for the name of the *fictional singer*. While Cheerleader just says \"Thompkins\", the full on-screen title for the performer is \"Cardboard Thompkins\". This full name is the most complete and accurate answer for the performing entity.\n*   The character is a clear parody of Thom Yorke, the lead singer of the band Radiohead, which adds context to the joke but is not the answer itself. The answer must be the fictional name used within the cartoon.\n*   It is important to distinguish between the name of the singer (\"Thompkins\") and the name of the specific performer at the prom (the object, which is labeled \"Cardboard Thompkins\"). Since the cutout itself is the performer, \"Cardboard Thompkins\" is the most direct answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on both the dialogue from Cheerleader and the text on the sign above the stage, the cardboard cutout performing at the Junior prom is identified as Cardboard Thompkins.\n\n<<<Cardboard Thompkins>>>"
