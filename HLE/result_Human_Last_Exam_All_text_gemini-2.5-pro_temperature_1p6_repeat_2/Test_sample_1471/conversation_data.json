    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Translate the Roman Numerals into Modern Numbers**\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Roman numeral in the equation to its corresponding modern (Arabic) number.\n\n*   **XXIV**:\n    *   `X` stands for 10, so `XX` is 20.\n    *   `IV` stands for 4 (since the smaller numeral `I` before the larger numeral `V` means subtraction: 5 - 1).\n    *   Therefore, **XXIV = 20 + 4 = 24**.\n\n*   **CCC**:\n    *   `C` stands for 100.\n    *   Therefore, **CCC = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300**.\n\n*   **CCXIII**:\n    *   `C` stands for 100, so `CC` is 200.\n    *   `X` stands for 10.\n    *   `I` stands for 1, so `III` is 3.\n    *   Therefore, **CCXIII = 200 + 10 + 3 = 213**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the subtractive principle in Roman numerals (like `IV`) and the additive principle (like `XX` or `CCC`).\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the Equation with Modern Numbers**\n\nNow, we replace the Roman numerals in the original equation with the modern numbers we just found:\nOriginal equation: XXIV / CCC - CCXIII = ?\nModern equation: **24 / 300 - 213 = ?**\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Equation Following the Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)**\n\nThe order of operations states that we must perform division before subtraction.\n\n*   **Part 1: Division**\n    *   Calculate `24 / 300`.\n    *   24 ÷ 300 = **0.08**\n\n*   **Part 2: Subtraction**\n    *   Now, take the result from the division and subtract 213.\n    *   0.08 - 213 = **-212.92**\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to perform the operations from left to right without regard to their order, which would be incorrect. Division must be completed first.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution to the equation is -212.92.\n\n<<<-212.92>>>"
