    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Board**\nThe objective is to place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. The final question asks for the number of empty edge squares after achieving this maximum placement.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Total Number of Edge Squares**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has a perimeter. We can count the squares on this perimeter:\n*   There are 8 squares on the top row (rank 8).\n*   There are 8 squares on the bottom row (rank 1).\n*   There are 6 additional squares on the left file (file 'a'), excluding the corners already counted.\n*   There are 6 additional squares on the right file (file 'h'), excluding the corners already counted.\n*   Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Bishop's Movement Constraint**\nA bishop moves diagonally and attacks any piece on the same diagonal. A crucial characteristic of a bishop's movement is that it always remains on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only attack other bishops on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other bishops on black squares. This allows us to solve the problem for white and black squares independently.\n\n**Step 4: Divide the Problem by Color**\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, half are white and half are black.\n*   Number of white edge squares = 14.\n*   Number of black edge squares = 14.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Maximum Bishops on White Edge Squares**\nWe need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares. If we examine these 14 squares, we find they form pairs that lie on the same diagonals. For example:\n*   Square a2 is on the same diagonal as g8.\n*   Square a4 is on the same diagonal as d1.\n*   Square b1 is on the same diagonal as h7.\nBy listing all such pairs, we find that the 14 white edge squares can be perfectly grouped into 7 pairs of squares that attack each other.\nSince we can only place one bishop in each attacking pair, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the white edge squares is 7.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Maximum Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\nThe logic is identical for the black squares. The 14 black edge squares can also be grouped into 7 distinct pairs of squares where the two squares in each pair lie on the same diagonal and therefore attack each other. For example:\n*   The corner a1 is on the same diagonal as the corner h8.\n*   Square c1 is on the same diagonal as a3.\n*   Square b8 is on the same diagonal as h2.\nAgain, we can only place one bishop per attacking pair. Thus, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the black edge squares is also 7.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Total Number of Placed Bishops**\nThe total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is the sum of the maximums for each color:\n*   Total placed bishops = 7 (on white) + 7 (on black) = 14 bishops.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the Number of Empty Edge Squares**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Number of placed bishops = 14.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
