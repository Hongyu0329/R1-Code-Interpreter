    "An analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Algorithm\n\n1.  **Step 1: Initialization**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n    *   This step consists of a fixed number of basic operations: one assignment for `i`, one for `x`, one division and one assignment for `q`, and one multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment for `a_0`.\n    *   Assuming these basic arithmetic operations take constant time, this step's complexity is O(1).\n\n2.  **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n    *   The loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true.\n    *   Inside the loop, Step 2.1 is executed:\n        *   `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc$`\n    *   Similar to Step 1, this block of code consists of a fixed number of basic operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Therefore, the time complexity of a single iteration of the loop is O(1).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Return**\n    *   `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))`\n    *   This step simply returns the computed result. The time taken is constant, O(1).\n\nThe overall complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the `while` loop. To find the total time complexity, we need to determine how many times the loop executes.\n\n### Analysis of the Number of Loop Iterations\n\nThe loop's execution depends on the value of `q`. Let's track how `q` changes over time. Let `q_k` be the value of `q` after the `k`-th iteration of the loop (where `k=0` is the state before the loop starts).\n\n*   **Before the loop (k=0):** `x` is `n`. `q_0 = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   **After iteration 1:** `x` becomes `q_0`. The new `q` is `q_1 = ⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊q_0/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n*   **After iteration 2:** `x` becomes `q_1`. The new `q` is `q_2 = ⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊q_1/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n*   **After iteration `k`:** The value of `q` will be `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This occurs when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`, which happens when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n\nLet `k` be the total number of iterations. The loop runs for `i = 1, 2, ..., k`. This means the loop condition `q > 0` was true for `k` times. The loop stops when `q` becomes 0. This happens after the `k`-th iteration. The last non-zero `q` was `q_{k-1} = ⌊n/c^k⌋ ≥ 1`.\nThis implies `n/c^k ≥ 1`, which means `n ≥ c^k`.\nTaking the base-`c` logarithm, we get `log_c(n) ≥ k`.\nSo, the number of iterations `k` is at most `log_c(n)`. More precisely, it is `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` (for `n ≥ c`). If `1 ≤ n < c`, `q` is 0 initially and the loop does not run. `⌊log_c(n)⌋ = 0` in this case as well, so the formula holds.\n\n### Calculating Total Time Complexity\n\nThe total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the time for each part:\n`T(n) = T(initialization) + T(loop) + T(return)`\n`T(n) = O(1) + (Number of iterations × Time per iteration) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = O(1) + (O(log_c n) × O(1)) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = O(log_c n)`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Model of Computation:** This analysis assumes a standard Random Access Machine (RAM) model where basic arithmetic operations (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `⌊/⌋`) on integers that fit within a machine word take constant time, O(1). This is a standard assumption in introductory algorithm analysis. If `n` were an arbitrarily large number requiring multiple machine words (bignum arithmetic), the cost of division would not be O(1), and the complexity would be higher, typically `O((log n)²)`. Given the context, the O(1) assumption for arithmetic is appropriate.\n2.  **Role of the Base `c`:** The complexity is `O(log_c n)`. By the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c n = log₂ n / log₂ c`. In complexity analysis, we often describe the growth rate with respect to the main input, `n`. If `c` is considered a constant (e.g., 2, 10, 16), then `log₂ c` is also a constant. Big-O notation ignores constant factors, so `O(log_c n)` simplifies to `O(log n)`. This is the standard way to express this complexity.\n3.  **Edge Case `n=0`:** If `n=0`, `q` is initialized to 0. The `while` loop condition `q > 0` is false from the start. The loop is skipped. The algorithm performs a constant number of operations and terminates. The complexity is O(1). The `O(log n)` complexity is typically understood to apply for `n ≥ 1`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe algorithm's runtime is determined by the number of divisions by `c` needed to reduce `n` to 0. This is fundamentally a logarithmic process. Since each step in the process takes constant time, the total time complexity is proportional to the number of steps, which is logarithmic with respect to `n`.\n\nFinal Computational Time Complexity: `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
