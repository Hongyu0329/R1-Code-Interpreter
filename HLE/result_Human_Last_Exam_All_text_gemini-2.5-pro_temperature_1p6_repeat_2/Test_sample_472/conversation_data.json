    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the given line of Latin poetry.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n**Step 1: Identify Potential Meter and Special Rules**\nThe line is from the Roman playwright Plautus (*Trinummus*, l. 347). Plautus's comedies often use meters like the Iambic Senarius or the Trochaic Septenarius. These meters, especially in Plautine Latin, are flexible and allow for many substitutions. This line fits the pattern of a **Trochaic Septenarius**. The base pattern is seven trochees (long-short, or L S) followed by a final, single syllable (catalexis). However, substitutions are very common.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Elision:** When a word ending in a vowel (or -m) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or h-), the first vowel is \"elided\" or dropped for scanning purposes. Here, `bene` ends in `-e` and `esse` begins with `e-`. So, we scan `ben' esse`, effectively removing one syllable from the line.\n2.  **Vowel Quantities:** We must know which vowels are naturally long (e.g., `sōlī` has a long 'o' and a long 'i') and which are naturally short (e.g., the vowels in `tibi`, `sibi`, `male`).\n3.  **Long by Position:** A syllable containing a short vowel becomes long if it is followed by two or more consonants, or by a double consonant (x, z). These consonants can be within the same word or span across two words.\n4.  **Metrical Substitutions:** In a Trochaic meter, a trochee (L S) can often be replaced by a spondee (L L). Plautus also frequently uses \"resolution,\" where a single long or short syllable in the base pattern is replaced by two short ones. A common resolution in a trochaic foot is for the short part (S) to be resolved into two shorts (SS), turning the trochee (L S) into a dactyl (L S S).\n\n**Step 2: Determine Syllable Lengths**\n\nLet's analyze each syllable of the line `et tibi ben' esse soli quom sibi sit male`.\n\n*   **et**: The vowel `e` is naturally short, but it is followed by two consonants: the `t` in `et` and the `t` at the start of `tibi`. Therefore, it is long by position. **L**\n*   **ti-**: The first syllable of `tibi`. The `i` is short and followed by only one consonant (`b`). It is short. **S**\n*   **-bi**: The second syllable of `tibi`. The `i` is short and followed by only one consonant (the `b` of `bene`, whose `-e` is elided). It is short. **S**\n*   **es-**: The first syllable of `esse`. The vowel `e` is short but followed by two `s`'s (`ss`). It is long by position. **L**\n*   **-se**: The second syllable of `esse`. The `e` is short but followed by the `s` of `esse` and the `s` of `soli`. It is long by position. **L**\n*   **so-**: The first syllable of `soli`. The `o` is naturally long (`sōlus`). It is long by nature. **L**\n*   **-li**: The second syllable of `soli`. The `i` is naturally long in the dative form (`sōlī`). It is long by nature. **L**\n*   **quom**: The vowel `o` is short, but it is followed by the `m` in `quom` and the `s` in `sibi`. It is long by position. **L**\n*   **si-**: The first syllable of `sibi`. The `i` is short and followed by one consonant (`b`). It is short. **S**\n*   **-bi**: The second syllable of `sibi`. The `i` is short and followed by one consonant (`s` of `sit`). It is short. **S**\n*   **sit**: The `i` is short, but it is followed by the `t` in `sit` and the `m` in `male`. It is long by position. **L**\n*   **ma-**: The first syllable of `male`. The `a` is short and followed by one consonant (`l`). It is short. **S**\n*   **-le**: The last syllable of the line. The `e` is naturally short. **S**\n\n**Step 3: Divide into Metrical Feet**\n\nNow, we group the sequence of long and short syllables (L S S L L L L L S S L S S) into the feet of a Trochaic Septenarius, allowing for spondee (L L) and dactyl (L S S) substitutions.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et tibi` gives the pattern `L S S`. This is a dactyl, a valid substitution for a trochee.\n*   **Foot 2:** `esse` gives the pattern `L L`. This is a spondee, a valid substitution.\n*   **Foot 3:** `soli` gives the pattern `L L`. This is also a spondee.\n*   **Foot 4:** `quom sibi` gives the pattern `L S S`. This is another dactyl substitution.\n*   **Foot 5:** `sit male` gives the pattern `L S S`. This is also a dactyl.\n\nThis analysis produces a five-foot line (`Dactyl | Spondee | Spondee | Dactyl | Dactyl`), which is inconsistent with the expected Trochaic Septenarius meter. The scansion of Plautine verse is notoriously complex and subject to debate due to rules like iambic shortening (`brevis brevians`) which are applied inconsistently.\n\nA more standard (though still complex) interpretation that forces the line into the Trochaic Septenarius pattern divides the syllables differently, often creating unusual feet via resolution:\n\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti bi` (L S S) - Dactyl\n*   **Foot 2**: `es se` (L L) - Spondee\n*   **Foot 3**: `so li` (L L) - Spondee\n*   **Foot 4**: `quom si` (L S) - Trochee\n*   **Foot 5**: `bi sit` (S L) - An iamb, which can appear after the main caesura.\n*   **Foot 6**: `ma le` (S S) - A pyrrhic, an unusual but possible resolution.\n*   **Foot 7 + Cat.**: `?` - This scansion also encounters problems.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most straightforward scansion based on the clearest rules (position, elision, basic quantities) results in the 5-foot structure. However, for the purpose of finding *a* plausible scansion that respects the likely meter, we acknowledge the line is highly irregular. A common scholarly scansion, despite its own difficulties, is presented here. The most defensible scansion derived purely from basic rules would be the Dactyl-Spondee mix. For the purpose of providing a single answer in the required format, we will use the most plausible division based on the sequence of longs and shorts derived above.\n\nFinal Proposed Scansion (Dactyl-Spondee Pentameter):\nL S S | L L | L L | L S S | L S S\n\n<<<L S S | L L | L L | L S S | L S S>>>"
