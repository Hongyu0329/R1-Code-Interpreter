    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction**\nThe primary and most common method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\nXe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reaction Conditions**\nThis reaction is an equilibrium (Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) ⇌ XeF₄(s)) and is exothermic (releases heat).\n*   **Thermodynamics:** Being an exothermic reaction, Le Chatelier's principle indicates that lower temperatures will favor the formation of the product (XeF4).\n*   **Kinetics:** However, the reaction has a high activation energy. This means that at low temperatures, the reaction rate is extremely slow, making the process impractical and inefficient.\n*   **Efficiency:** For a reaction to be considered \"efficient,\" there must be a balance between favorable thermodynamics and fast kinetics. This means a compromise temperature is needed—one that is high enough for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate but not so high that the equilibrium shifts back to the reactants or that undesirable side products (like XeF6) are formed.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Standard Synthesis Method**\nThe well-established, standard laboratory method for producing XeF4 involves the following conditions:\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** A stoichiometric excess of fluorine is used, typically a molar ratio of Xe:F₂ of about 1:5.\n*   **Pressure:** The reaction is performed under pressure, typically around 6 atmospheres, to favor the product side (which has fewer moles of gas).\n*   **Temperature:** The mixture is heated in a sealed nickel vessel (nickel acts as a catalyst and is resistant to fluorine). The optimal temperature cited in virtually all inorganic chemistry textbooks and scientific literature for this synthesis is **400 °C**. At this temperature, a good yield of XeF4 can be obtained within a few hours.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Temperature Options**\nLet's analyze each temperature choice in the context of producing XeF4 \"efficiently\":\n\n*   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is higher than the standard optimum. While the reaction would be fast, it could also lead to the decomposition of XeF4 back into its elements or the formation of more Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6), thus reducing the efficiency of producing pure XeF4. It is not the *coldest* efficient temperature.\n*   **B. 400 C:** This is the benchmark temperature used for the efficient, high-yield synthesis of XeF4. It provides the necessary activation energy for a good reaction rate without causing significant decomposition or side reactions.\n*   **C. 200 C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be significantly lower than at 400 °C. The time required to produce a substantial amount of product would be much longer, making the process inefficient from a practical standpoint.\n*   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** At these near-ambient or sub-zero temperatures, the thermal energy is insufficient to overcome the reaction's activation energy. The reaction would not proceed at any practical rate. While other methods like photochemical synthesis or electric discharge can initiate reactions at low temperatures, they often produce a mixture of products (XeF2, XeF4) and are generally considered less efficient and less controllable for producing pure XeF4 than the standard thermal method.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Coldest Efficient Temperature**\nThe question asks for the *coldest* temperature at which XeF4 can *still be produced efficiently*. Based on the analysis, 400 °C is the established temperature for efficient production. Temperatures significantly lower than this result in an inefficiently slow reaction rate. Therefore, among the choices provided, 400 °C is the coldest temperature at which the synthesis is considered efficient.\n\n<<<B>>>"
