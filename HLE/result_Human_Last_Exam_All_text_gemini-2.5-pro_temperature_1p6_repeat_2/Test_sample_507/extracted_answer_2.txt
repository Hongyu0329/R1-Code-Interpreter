The two languages are Korean and Tamil. In Korean, "mom" is 엄마 (eomma) and "dad" is 아빠 (appa). In Tamil, "mom" is அம்மா (ammā) and "dad" is அப்பா (appā). These pairs are nearly identical. While the most common words for "broom" differ, the similarity between the parental terms in these two geographically and culturally distant languages is a well-known linguistic curiosity that fits the question's premise.
