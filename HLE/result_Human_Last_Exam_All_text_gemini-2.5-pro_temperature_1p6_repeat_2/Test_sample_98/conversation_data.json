    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron**\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 vertices. A key property is its high degree of symmetry. Specifically, it has a center of symmetry (also called a center of inversion). This means that for any point on the surface or in the interior of the icosahedron, there is a corresponding point directly opposite it through the center, at the same distance from the center.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Orientation of the Tank**\nThe problem states the icosahedron tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means its base is a horizontal equilateral triangle. The face directly opposite this base is also an equilateral triangle, and due to the icosahedron's symmetry, this top face is parallel to the base. The vertical line passing through the centers of the base face and the top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**\n\"Half-filled\" means the tank contains a volume of water equal to exactly half of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Use Symmetry to Locate the Water Surface**\nBecause the icosahedron possesses a center of symmetry, a horizontal plane passing through this geometric center will divide the entire volume of the icosahedron into two identical halves. The bottom half is the mirror image of the top half (or more accurately, the inverted image). Therefore, the volume of the icosahedron below this central plane is exactly half of the total volume.\nWhen the tank is filled with water up to this central plane, it will be precisely half-filled. Thus, the surface of the water must be the shape of the cross-section of the icosahedron created by this central horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Shape of the Central Cross-Section**\nNow, the problem is reduced to finding the geometric shape of the icosahedron's cross-section at its mid-height, perpendicular to the axis that joins the centers of the top and bottom faces.\n\n*   **Symmetry of the Cross-Section:** The vertical axis (normal to the base) is a 3-fold rotation axis. The central plane is perpendicular to this axis. The icosahedron also has symmetry planes and other rotation axes. The cross-section must possess all the symmetries of the icosahedron that lie within that plane. These symmetries dictate that the resulting 2D shape must be highly regular. Specifically, the combination of 3-fold rotation and the other symmetries of the icosahedron that act on this plane (such as inversion and C2 rotations) forces the cross-section to be a regular hexagon.\n\n*   **Constructive Proof:** We can also find the shape by identifying which edges of the icosahedron are cut by this central plane.\n    1.  No vertices of the icosahedron lie on this central plane. In this orientation, there are four \"layers\" of vertices: the 3 vertices of the base triangle, 3 vertices just above the base, 3 vertices just below the top, and the 3 vertices of the top triangle.\n    2.  The central plane lies between the two middle layers of vertices.\n    3.  Therefore, the plane must intersect the edges that connect the lower-middle layer of vertices to the upper-middle layer of vertices.\n    4.  There are exactly 6 such edges that form the \"waist\" of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n    5.  Due to symmetry, the central plane cuts each of these 6 edges at its exact midpoint.\n    6.  These 6 midpoints form the vertices of the cross-section. When connected, they form a perfectly regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled with water, the water level reaches the center of the icosahedron. The shape of the water's surface is the central cross-section of the icosahedron, which is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
