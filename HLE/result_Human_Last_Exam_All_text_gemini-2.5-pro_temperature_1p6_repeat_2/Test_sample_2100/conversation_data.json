    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"Andrei Voznesensky called this man 'a joy-discovering sailor' and wondered, 'Where is your grave, even a mound?'\"\n    *   The source is a specific Russian poet, Andrei Voznesensky. This narrows the search to figures celebrated or lamented in his work.\n    *   The quotes are from Voznesensky's famous poem which served as the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\").\n    *   The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the historical figure Nikolai Rezanov. He was a Russian nobleman and statesman who led a mission to California in 1806 on behalf of the Russian-American Company. The term \"sailor\" or navigator is fitting.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** The question about the lost grave (\"Where is your grave, even a mound?\") points to a person whose burial site was unknown for a long time.\n    *   Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in the city of Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning to St. Petersburg.\n    *   He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, the cathedral and its cemetery were demolished during the Soviet period, and the exact location of his grave was lost. Voznesensky's poem explicitly laments this fact.\n\n3.  **Analyze the third clue:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n    *   This is the key piece of information that confirms the identity. The immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" sparked renewed public and historical interest in Rezanov's fate.\n    *   In the late 1980s, a special commission was formed in Krasnoyarsk to find the grave.\n    *   While his actual remains were not recovered, the commission identified the supposed location of his burial. A memorial service was held, and a monument—a large white cross—was erected on the presumed site of the grave. This event in the late 1980s provided the symbolic \"answer\" to the question posed by Voznesensky.\n\n**List of careful points:**\n\n*   The connection between Andrei Voznesensky and the \"sailor\" is crucial; it is not just any sailor, but one specifically written about by this poet.\n*   The \"Juno and Avos\" rock opera is the direct source of the quotes and the cultural phenomenon that led to the rediscovery of the gravesite.\n*   The death of the person had to occur in a way that their grave could be lost (e.g., dying far from home, burial in a place later destroyed).\n*   The timeline of the grave's rediscovery (\"late 1980s\") must match the historical facts for the identified person.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll the clues point directly to Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He was the \"sailor\" and protagonist of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos,\" his grave in Krasnoyarsk was lost, and a memorial marking its presumed location was established in the late 1980s as a direct result of the opera's fame. The question asks for the man's last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
