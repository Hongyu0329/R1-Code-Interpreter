    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is another term for a 2-dimensional square grid or square lattice. Points on the lattice have integer coordinates `(x, y)`. Movement is restricted to adjacent points, either horizontally or vertically.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A self-avoiding walk of length `n` is a sequence of `n+1` distinct vertices `v_0, v_1, ..., v_n` on the lattice, where `v_0` is the starting point (usually the origin `(0,0)`) and each vertex `v_i` is a neighbor of the previous vertex `v_{i-1}`. The \"self-avoiding\" condition means that `v_i ≠ v_j` for all `i ≠ j`. In simpler terms, the path never crosses or touches itself.\n*   **a(n):** This function represents the total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed point.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation for Small Values of n\n\nLet's calculate the first few values of `a(n)` to understand the process. We assume the walk starts at the origin (0,0).\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin, there are 4 possible moves: Right to (1,0), Left to (-1,0), Up to (0,1), or Down to (0,-1). All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`.\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    From any of the 4 positions after step 1, we can take a second step. For example, if the first step was to (1,0), the possible moves are to (2,0), (0,0), (1,1), or (1,-1). The move back to the origin (0,0) is forbidden, as it would revisit a site. This leaves 3 valid moves. Since there were 4 possible first steps, each with 3 valid continuations:\n    *   `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`.\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    For each of the 12 paths of length 2, we consider the next step. Let the path be `v_0 -> v_1 -> v_2`. The next step `v_3` cannot be `v_2`. We must also check if `v_3` equals `v_0`. For any 2-step path (which is either a straight line or an L-shape), the endpoint `v_2` is not adjacent to the origin `v_0`. Therefore, none of the 3 available moves can lead back to the origin.\n    *   `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    Here, the problem becomes more complex. For a 3-step walk `v_0 -> v_1 -> v_2 -> v_3`, we must check if a potential fourth step to `v_4` makes it collide with a previous vertex, i.e., `v_4 = v_1` or `v_4 = v_0`.\n    *   A collision with `v_1` is impossible based on the geometry of a 3-step walk.\n    *   A collision with `v_0` is possible. This occurs if the endpoint of the 3-step walk, `v_3`, is a neighbor of the starting point, `v_0`.\n    *   Let's count how many 3-step paths end at a neighbor of the origin. These paths must form three sides of a 1x1 square (e.g., `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1)`). We can count these: 4 choices for the first step, 2 choices for the second (must turn), and 1 choice for the third (to complete the \"U\" shape). This gives `4 * 2 * 1 = 8` such paths.\n    *   For these 8 paths, one of the three potential next steps leads to `v_0` and is forbidden. Thus, they have only 2 valid extensions.\n    *   The remaining `36 - 8 = 28` paths do not end adjacent to the origin and thus have 3 valid extensions.\n    *   `a(4) = (8 paths * 2 extensions) + (28 paths * 3 extensions) = 16 + 84 = 100`.\n\n### Step 3: Increasing Complexity and the Final Calculation\n\nAs we see, calculating `a(n)` requires an increasingly complex case-by-case analysis. For `a(5)`, we would need to classify the 100 paths of length 4 based on whether their endpoint is adjacent to `v_0`, `v_1`, or `v_2`.\n*   A key observation from lattice geometry (`parity` or `checkerboard coloring`) is that after an even number of steps (`n=4`), the endpoint `v_4` cannot be adjacent to the origin `v_0`. So, a collision with `v_0` is impossible for the 5th step.\n*   However, `v_4` can be adjacent to `v_1`. A careful calculation shows this happens for 16 of the 100 paths.\n*   So for `a(5)`: `(16 paths * 2 extensions) + ((100-16) paths * 3 extensions) = 32 + 84*3 = 32 + 252 = 284`.\n\nThis process of direct enumeration becomes computationally intractable by hand for larger `n` like `n=10`. There is no simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`. The values for `a(n)` are well-known in the field of statistical mechanics and combinatorics and are determined by sophisticated computer algorithms. The sequence is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411.\n\nFollowing this known sequence, the value for `a(10)` is:\n\n`a(0) = 1`\n`a(1) = 4`\n`a(2) = 12`\n`a(3) = 36`\n`a(4) = 100`\n`a(5) = 284`\n`a(6) = 780`\n`a(7) = 2,172`\n`a(8) = 5,916`\n`a(9) = 16,268`\n`a(10) = 44,100`\n\n<<<44100>>>"
