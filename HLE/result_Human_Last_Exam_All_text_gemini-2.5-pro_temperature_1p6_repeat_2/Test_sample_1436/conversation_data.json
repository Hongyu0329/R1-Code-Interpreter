    "To determine the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram, we need to analyze the combinatorial factors that arise during its generation in perturbative quantum field theory. The symmetry factor, denoted by $S$, is an integer that divides the naively calculated amplitude of a diagram to correct for overcounting due to the indistinguishability of vertices, lines, and internal field configurations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Diagram's Topology**\n\nThe question specifies a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's call them $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n*   **Four field contractions:** This means there are four propagators (lines) in the diagram.\n*   The context is \"perturbative Green's function analysis,\" which implies these propagators are formed by Wick contractions of fields from the interaction terms. Since there are only two vertices, all four propagators must connect $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n\nThis describes a vacuum diagram (or a sub-diagram) that looks like two points connected by four parallel lines. A common theoretical framework for such a diagram is a scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction, where each vertex connects four lines. The described diagram is a second-order contribution to a correlation function.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Term in the Perturbative Expansion**\n\nLet's assume the interaction Lagrangian is $L_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$. The $4!$ is a convention to simplify the Feynman rules. A diagram with two vertices arises from the second-order term in the expansion of the interaction part of the path integral, $e^{iS_{int}}$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2!} \\left( i \\int d^4x L_{int}(x) \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2!} \\left( \\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!} \\int d^4x \\phi^4(x) \\right)^2 $$\nWhen we perform Wick contractions, we are dealing with the term $\\frac{1}{2!} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\right)^2 \\langle \\phi(x_1)^4 \\phi(x_2)^4 \\rangle$. The total combinatorial factor associated with the diagram's amplitude will be this pre-factor multiplied by the number of ways to form the diagram through contractions. This combined factor is equal to $1/S$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Symmetry Factor**\n\nThere are two common and reliable methods to calculate the symmetry factor $S$.\n\n**Method A: Counting Wick Contractions**\n\n1.  **Count the number of ways to form the diagram.** We start with eight fields, four at vertex $V_1$ (position $x_1$) and four at $V_2$ (position $x_2$). We need to contract all four fields at $V_1$ with the four fields at $V_2$.\n    *   Take the first field at $V_1$. It can be contracted with any of the 4 fields at $V_2$. This gives 4 choices.\n    *   Take the second field at $V_1$. It can be contracted with any of the remaining 3 fields at $V_2$. This gives 3 choices.\n    *   Take the third field at $V_1$. It can be contracted with any of the remaining 2 fields at $V_2$. This gives 2 choices.\n    *   The last field at $V_1$ must contract with the one remaining field at $V_2$. This gives 1 choice.\n    The total number of ways to form the desired pairings (contractions) is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4! = 24$.\n\n2.  **Combine this with the theoretical pre-factors.** The numerical coefficient of the resulting diagrammatic integral is defined as $1/S$.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{S} = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2!}}_{\\text{from expansion of } e^{S_{int}}} \\times \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{1}{4!}\\right)^2}_{\\text{from } L_{int}} \\times \\underbrace{(4!)}_{\\text{from contractions}} $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{(24)^2} \\times 24 = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 576} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 24} = \\frac{1}{48} $$\n\n3.  **Find S.** From the above relation, we get $S = 48$.\n\n**Method B: Counting Diagram Automorphisms**\n\nThe symmetry factor $S$ is the order of the group of automorphisms of the diagram, i.e., the number of permutations of its vertices and lines that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\n1.  **Symmetry from permuting propagators:** The four propagators connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$ are indistinguishable. We can permute them in any way without changing the diagram. The number of permutations of these 4 lines is $4! = 24$.\n2.  **Symmetry from permuting vertices:** The two vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$ are of the same type ($\\phi^4$), and since there are no external lines to distinguish them, they are equivalent. We can swap the vertices, and the diagram remains identical (the four lines from $V_1$ to $V_2$ become four lines from $V_2$ to $V_1$, which is the same structure). The number of permutations of these 2 vertices is $2! = 2$.\n\n3.  **Combine the symmetries.** The total symmetry factor is the product of the number of these independent symmetry operations.\n    $$ S = (\\text{Number of propagator permutations}) \\times (\\text{Number of vertex permutations}) $$\n    $$ S = 24 \\times 2 = 48 $$\n\nBoth methods give the same result.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The $1/k!$ Factor:** When expanding $e^{iS_{int}}$, a term with $k$ identical vertices from the interaction Lagrangian $L_{int}$ comes with a factor of $1/k!$. In our case, $k=2$.\n2.  **The $1/n!$ Factor:** The interaction Lagrangian itself, e.g., $L_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{n!}\\phi^n$, includes a factor of $1/n!$ to cancel combinatorics at a single vertex. For a $\\phi^4$ theory, $n=4$.\n3.  **Propagator Equivalence:** Propagators are equivalent if they connect the same pair of vertices (or a vertex to itself) and are of the same field type.\n4.  **Vertex Equivalence:** Vertices are equivalent if they are of the same type and can be interchanged without altering the diagram's topology (which is typically true for vacuum diagrams or diagrams with high symmetry).\n5.  **Distinguishing Methods:** The contraction method computes the overall coefficient $1/S$ by multiplying all combinatorial numbers, while the automorphism method directly counts the symmetries of the final diagram to find $S$. It's crucial not to mix them.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis using two different but consistent methods, the symmetry factor is calculated as the product of the symmetry from permuting the four identical propagators ($4! = 24$) and the symmetry from permuting the two identical vertices ($2! = 2$).\n\nFinal calculation: $S = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
