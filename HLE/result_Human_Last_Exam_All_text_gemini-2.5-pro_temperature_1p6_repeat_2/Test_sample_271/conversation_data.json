    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe can try to find a factorization by grouping terms.\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2-2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nThis grouping seems to work:\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x^3 + 18x + 3x^2 - 6$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2-2) + 3x^2 - 6$\n$f(x) = (x^5-9x)(x^2-2) + 3(x^2-2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5-9x+3)(x^2-2)$\n\nSo the polynomial factors into $g(x) = x^5-9x+3$ and $h(x) = x^2-2$.\n\n**Careful point:** Always verify the factorization.\n$(x^5-9x+3)(x^2-2) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 18x + 3x^2 - 6$.\nThe factorization is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the irreducibility of the factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\n*   For $h(x) = x^2-2$, the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   For $g(x) = x^5-9x+3$, we can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n    1.  The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 3.\n    2.  All other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are divisible by 3.\n    3.  The constant term is 3, and $p^2=9$ does not divide 3.\n    Therefore, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field K**\n\nLet $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$ and $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$. The splitting field of $f(x)$ is the compositum $K = K_g K_h$.\n\n*   The splitting field of $h(x)=x^2-2$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   The splitting field of $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$ is $K_g$. Since $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. To determine which subgroup it is, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$.\n    $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = -\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 < 0$.\n    $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 6 = \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 > 0$.\n    Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has 3 real roots and therefore 2 complex conjugate roots.\n*   **Careful point:** A standard theorem in Galois theory states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$.\n    Here, $p=5$, so $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of this extension is $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\nThe Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The structure of $G$ depends on the intersection of the fields $K_g$ and $K_h$.\n$G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Careful point:** We need to check if $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_g$.\n    $K_g$ is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with group $S_5$. The quadratic subfields of $K_g$ correspond to normal subgroups of $S_5$ of index 2. The only such subgroup is the alternating group $A_5$. Thus, $K_g$ has a unique quadratic subfield.\n    This subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_g})$, where $D_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$.\n    The discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\n    For $n=5, a=-9, b=3$, we get $D_g = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 4^4 (-9)^5) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\n    The unique quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\n    Since $-14863419 \\neq 2k^2$ for any rational $k$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Therefore, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSo, the Galois group of $K$ is the direct product $G \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5 \\times C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find all possible degrees of intermediate normal extensions**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ and subgroups of $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H]$.\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ translates to finding proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$.\n\n**Step 5: Find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=S_5 \\times C_2$**\n\nLet $G_1 = S_5$ and $G_2 = C_2$. The normal subgroups of $G_1$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$. The normal subgroups of $G_2$ are $\\{e_2\\}, C_2$.\n\n*   **Type 1: Product of normal subgroups.** These are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\vartriangleleft S_5$ and $N_2 \\vartriangleleft C_2$.\n    Excluding the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e_2\\}$ and the whole group $S_5 \\times C_2$, we have:\n    1.  $N = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|N|=2$. Index is $240/2 = 120$.\n    2.  $N = A_5 \\times \\{e_2\\}$: $|N|=60$. Index is $240/60 = 4$.\n    3.  $N = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|N|=120$. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n    4.  $N = S_5 \\times \\{e_2\\}$: $|N|=120$. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\n*   **Type 2: \"Diagonal\" normal subgroups.**\n    **Careful point:** Not all normal subgroups of a direct product are products of normal subgroups. Other normal subgroups can exist if there is a common normal quotient group between the factors.\n    Here, $S_5$ has a normal subgroup $A_5$ with quotient $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. Also, $C_2$ has a normal subgroup $\\{e_2\\}$ with quotient $C_2/\\{e_2\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    The isomorphism between these quotients gives rise to a normal subgroup $N_{\\text{diag}} \\vartriangleleft S_5 \\times C_2$.\n    This subgroup can be described as $N_{\\text{diag}} = \\{(s,c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(s) = \\phi(c) \\}$, where $\\phi: C_2 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ is an isomorphism. Let's represent $C_2$ as $\\{1, -1\\}$. Then $N_{\\text{diag}} = \\{(s,c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(s) = c\\}$.\n    This group consists of pairs $(s, 1)$ where $s \\in A_5$ (even permutations), and pairs $(s,-1)$ where $s \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5$ (odd permutations).\n    The order of this subgroup is $|N_{\\text{diag}}| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    5. $N = N_{\\text{diag}}$: $|N|=120$. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThese are all the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n**Step 6: List the possible degrees**\n\nThe possible degrees of the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of the normal subgroups found in Step 5.\n*   Index 120 (from $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$)\n*   Index 4 (from $A_5 \\times \\{e_2\\}$)\n*   Index 2 (from $A_5 \\times C_2$, $S_5 \\times \\{e_2\\}$, and $N_{\\text{diag}}$)\n\nThe set of all possible distinct degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\nFinal answer acquisition:\nThe degrees correspond to the following normal extensions:\n*   Degree 2: Three distinct quadratic extensions $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_g})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2 D_g})$.\n*   Degree 4: The biquadratic extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D_g})$.\n*   Degree 120: The splitting field $K_g$ of $x^5-9x+3$.\n\nThe list of all possible degrees is therefore 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
