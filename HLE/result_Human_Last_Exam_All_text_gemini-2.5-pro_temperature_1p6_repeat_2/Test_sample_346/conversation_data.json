    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the given SKI combinator expression, interpreting its components as Church numerals and arithmetic operations.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding SKI Combinators and Church Numerals\n\n*   **SKI Combinators**: These are a minimal set of functions from which all computable functions can be built. Their reduction rules are:\n    *   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n    *   `K x y = x`\n    *   `I x = x` (Note: `I` can be defined as `S K K`)\n*   **Church Numerals**: These are representations of natural numbers using higher-order functions. A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes two arguments, a function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` `n` times.\n    *   `n f x = f(f(...(f x)...))` (`n` applications of `f`)\n    *   `0 = λf.λx. x`\n    *   `1 = λf.λx. f x`\n    *   `2 = λf.λx. f(f x)`\n\n### Step 2: Deconstructing the Main Expression\n\nThe expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`.\n\nLet's break this down into the form `Term1 Term2 Term3`.\nThe expression is `(S(I)) (X) (Y)`, where:\n*   `Term1 = S(I)`\n*   `X = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))`\n*   `Y = A (S(I)(I))`\n*   and `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze `S(I)`\n\nThe combinator `S(I)` can be translated into lambda calculus:\n`S(I) = λx.λy. I x (x y)`\nSince `I x = x`, this simplifies to:\n`S(I) = λx.λy. x (x y)`\nThis is precisely the definition of the Church numeral **2**. If we replace `x` with `f` and `y` with `x`, we get `λf.λx. f(f x)`.\n\nSo, the entire expression `E` is equivalent to `2 X Y`, which, by the definition of the Church numeral 2, reduces to `X (X Y)`. This means we must first evaluate `X Y` and then apply `X` to that result.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Components `X` and `Y`\n\nTo find the value of `E = X(X Y)`, we first need to find what the combinators `X` and `Y` represent.\n\n**A. Evaluate `S(I)(I)`:**\nLet's first evaluate the simplest component, `B = S(I)(I)`, which appears inside `Y`.\n`B = S(I)(I)`\nAs we just showed `S(I)` is the Church numeral 2, `B` is the application of `2` to `I`.\nLet's see what `2 I` is. Using the lambda form `λf.λx.f(fx)`, `2 I = λx.I(Ix) = λx.Ix = λx.x = I`. This is incorrect. The combinators must be fully applied.\n`S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`.\nSo, `S(I)(I)` is the Church numeral **2**.\n\n**B. Evaluate `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`:**\nThis term is complex. Let's analyze the operator `Op = S(S(K(S))(K))`.\nThe sub-expression `S(K(S))(K)` can be shown to be the `B` combinator for function composition (`B x y z = x(y z)`).\n*   `S(K(S))(K) x y z = (K(S) x) (K x) y z = S (K x) y z = (K x) z (y z) = x (y z)`. So, `S(K(S))(K) = B`.\n*   Therefore, `Op = S(B)`.\nNow we evaluate `A = Op(I) = S(B) I`. Let's see how this combinator `A` acts on an argument `n`.\n*   `A n = (S(B) I) n = B I (n I)`.\n*   We know `B I z = I(z) = z`. So the expression simplifies to `n I`.\n*   The term `n I` means applying the Church numeral `n` to the identity combinator `I`. In Church arithmetic, `n I` is the Church numeral `n` itself.\n    *   `(n I) f x = n (I f) x`. Since `I f = f`, this is `n f x`.\n    *   Therefore, `n I = n`.\n*   This means `A n = n`, so the combinator `A` is the identity combinator `I`.\nSo, **`A = I`**.\n\n**C. Evaluate `Y`:**\n`Y = A (S(I)(I))`\nWe found `A = I` and `S(I)(I) = 2`.\nSo, `Y = I(2) = 2`.\n\n**D. Evaluate `X`:**\n`X = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))`\nSince `A = I`, this becomes `X = S(I)(S(I)(K(I)))`.\nLet's evaluate the inner part `P = S(I)(K(I))`.\n`P q = (S(I)(K I)) q = I q ((K I) q) = q(I) = q I`.\nAs established before, `q I = q`.\nSo `P q = q`, which means `P` is the identity combinator, `P=I`.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for `X`:\n`X = S(I) (I)`.\nWe already evaluated this to be the Church numeral **2**. So, `X = 2`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nWe have successfully reduced all the components:\n*   The whole expression is `E = X (X Y)`\n*   `X = 2`\n*   `Y = 2`\n\nSubstituting these values in, we get:\n`E = 2 (2 2)`\n\nThis is a series of applications of Church numerals. In lambda calculus and combinatory logic, applying a Church numeral `n` to another Church numeral `m`, written `n m`, results in the Church numeral for exponentiation, **m^n**.\n\n1.  First, evaluate the inner expression: `(2 2)`.\n    *   This corresponds to `2^2 = 4`.\n2.  Now substitute this result back into the main expression: `2 (4)`.\n    *   This corresponds to `4^2 = 16`.\n\nThus, the given SKI combinator expression is the Church numeral `n = 16`.\n\n### Step 6: Compute the Final Answer\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\nGiven `n = 16`, we calculate:\n`log_2(16) = log_2(2^4) = 4`"
