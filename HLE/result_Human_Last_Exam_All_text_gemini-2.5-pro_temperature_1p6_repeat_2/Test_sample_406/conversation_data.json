    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F, G, and H is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies a system of equations. Based on the function signatures, and resolving likely typos by assuming a standard symmetric structure common in fixed point theory, the system is:\n*   `F(x, y, z) = x`, for `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G(y, z, x) = y`, for `G: Y × Z × X → Y`\n*   `H(z, x, y) = z`, for `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are given by extending the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to this system of operators.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Formulation**: The search for an FGH-tripled fixed point is equivalent to finding a fixed point for a single operator `T` defined on the product space `M = X × Y × Z`. This operator is defined as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, z, x), H(z, x, y))`\n    A point `p = (x, y, z)` is a fixed point of `T` if `T(p) = p`, which is exactly the system of equations we want to solve.\n\n2.  **Applying the Banach Fixed Point Theorem**: The Banach Fixed Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point. We apply this theorem to the operator `T` and the space `M`. This leads to two main categories of conditions.\n\n### Careful Points and Key Conditions\n\n**A. Conditions on the Spaces (X, Y, Z)**\n\n*   The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces**.\n    *   A **metric space** means each set has a function (e.g., `d_X`, `d_Y`, `d_Z`) that defines a \"distance\" between any two points in that set.\n    *   **Completeness** means that every Cauchy sequence (a sequence whose elements get progressively closer to each other) in the space converges to a limit that is also within that space. This is a crucial requirement for the iterative proof of the theorem to work.\n    *   The product space `M = X × Y × Z` automatically becomes a non-empty complete metric space if `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are. A metric `D` on this space is typically defined as the sum of the individual metrics: `D((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`.\n\n**B. Conditions on the Functions (F, G, H)**\n\n*   The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively form a **contraction mapping** on the product space `M`. This means that when applied, the operator `T` must shrink the distance between any two points in `M` by a constant factor `k` where `0 ≤ k < 1`.\n\nA sufficient way to ensure `T` is a contraction is to impose the following Lipschitz-type conditions on the individual functions F, G, and H. There must exist non-negative constants `a₁, a₂, a₃, b₁, b₂, b₃, c₁, c₂, c₃` such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)`:\n\n1.  `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y₁, z₁, x₁), G(y₂, z₂, x₂)) ≤ b₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + b₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z₁, x₁, y₁), H(z₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ c₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂·d_X(x₁, x₂) + c₃·d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n\nAnd, most importantly, the sum of these constants in specific combinations must be less than 1. This ensures the overall mapping `T` is a contraction. The specific condition on the constants is:\n`max { (a₁ + b₃ + c₂), (a₂ + b₁ + c₃), (a₃ + b₂ + c₁) } < 1`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIn summary, the conditions for the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n1.  **Space Condition**: The domains `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty complete metric spaces with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z` respectively.\n2.  **Contraction Condition**: There must exist non-negative constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ` (for i=1,2,3) such that for all `x₁,x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁,y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁,z₂ ∈ Z`, the functions satisfy the Lipschitz-type inequalities:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, z₁, x₁), G(y₂, z₂, x₂)) ≤ b₁d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂d_Z(z₁, z₂) + b₃d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, x₁, y₁), H(z₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ c₁d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂d_X(x₁, x₂) + c₃d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n\n    And these constants must satisfy the following aggregate condition:\n    `max { (a₁ + b₃ + c₂), (a₂ + b₁ + c₃), (a₃ + b₂ + c₁) } < 1`\n\nIf these conditions hold, there exists a unique triplet `(x, y, z)` in `X × Y × Z` that is an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<The primary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are: (1) The sets X, Y, and Z must be non-empty complete metric spaces. (2) The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a contraction mapping condition on the product space X × Y × Z. A sufficient way to meet this is for the functions to obey a set of Lipschitz-type inequalities with constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ` such that `max{(a₁+b₃+c₂), (a₂+b₁+c₃), (a₃+b₂+c₁)} < 1`.>>>"
