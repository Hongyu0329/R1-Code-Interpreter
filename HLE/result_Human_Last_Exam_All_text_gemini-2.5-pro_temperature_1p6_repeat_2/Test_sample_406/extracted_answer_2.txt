The primary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are: (1) The sets X, Y, and Z must be non-empty complete metric spaces. (2) The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a contraction mapping condition on the product space X × Y × Z. A sufficient way to meet this is for the functions to obey a set of Lipschitz-type inequalities with constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ` such that `max{(a₁+b₃+c₂), (a₂+b₁+c₃), (a₃+b₂+c₁)} < 1`.
