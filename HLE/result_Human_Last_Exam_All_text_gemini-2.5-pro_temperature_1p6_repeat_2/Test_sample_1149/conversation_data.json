    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for a specific anatomical detail: the number of depressions within the lacrimal recess of the dinosaur species *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Anatomical Terms:**\n    *   ***Irritator challengeri***: A species of spinosaurid theropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil. Our knowledge of this species comes primarily from a single, well-preserved (though incomplete) skull, the holotype specimen SMNS 58022.\n    *   **Lacrimal:** This is a bone of the skull that forms the anterior (front) margin of the orbit (eye socket) and the posterior (rear) margin of the antorbital fenestra (a large opening in the skull in front of the eye).\n    *   **Lacrimal Recess:** This is a distinct fossa or depression on the lacrimal bone. In many theropods, this recess housed pneumatic diverticula (air sacs) connected to the respiratory system.\n    *   **Depressions:** The question is asking for the number of smaller hollows or pits located *within* this larger lacrimal recess.\n\n3.  **Consult the Primary Scientific Source:** To find a precise anatomical count, it is essential to refer to the formal scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull. The definitive publication is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"*Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n\n4.  **Examine the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of each bone of the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they specifically mention the features on its medial surface (the surface facing inwards, towards the midline of the skull).\n\n5.  **Locate the Specific Count:** On page 539 of the paper by Sues et al. (2002), the description of the lacrimal states: \"The medial surface of the descending process of the lacrimal bears a large, deep recess... This recess housed a diverticulum of the paranasal sinus system. It has **two subsidiary depressions**...\"\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Source Reliability:** The answer relies on the most detailed and authoritative scientific description of the only known skull of *Irritator challengeri*. Any answer must be based on this primary source.\n*   **Specificity:** The question is not asking about the total number of openings (fenestrae) or depressions on the entire lacrimal bone, but specifically about the number of \"subsidiary depressions\" *within* the main lacrimal recess.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** The term \"subsidiary depressions\" is the precise language used in the scientific literature to describe these features.\n*   **Holotype Basis:** This count is based on the single known specimen (SMNS 58022). It is assumed this represents the typical condition for the species, but individual variation could theoretically exist if more specimens were found.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the primary scientific description, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains two smaller, subsidiary depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
