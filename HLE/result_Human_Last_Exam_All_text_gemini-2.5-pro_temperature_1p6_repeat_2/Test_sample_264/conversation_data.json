    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Establish a Coordinate System and Define the First Cube**\nTo analyze the problem, we first set up a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's place the first cube, Cube A, in a standard position. We can define its boundaries by placing one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and aligning its edges with the coordinate axes.\n\n*   **Cube A:** The set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   $0 \\le x \\le 1$\n    *   $0 \\le y \\le 1$\n    *   $0 \\le z \\le 1$\nThis cube has a side length of 1, as specified. One of its main diagonals connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this main diagonal is $\\vec{d} = (1, 1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Shift and Define the Second Cube**\nThe second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A. The description of the shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\" This is a key point that requires careful interpretation.\n\n*   **Direction of Shift:** \"Along the main diagonal\" means the shift is in the direction of the vector $\\vec{d} = (1, 1, 1)$.\n*   **Magnitude of Shift:** \"By 1/2\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n    1.  The shift vector is $(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$. This means the components of the shift along each axis are 1/2.\n    2.  The Euclidean distance of the shift is 1/2. This would mean the shift vector is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(1,1,1)}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2}} = (\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}})$.\n\n*   **Choosing the Interpretation:** For this type of geometric puzzle, the first interpretation is overwhelmingly more common. It leads to a simpler geometric arrangement and a clean, rational answer, whereas the second interpretation results in a complex, irrational answer. We will proceed with the standard interpretation that the shift vector is $\\vec{s} = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$.\n\n*   **Cube B:** Cube B is formed by translating every point of Cube A by the shift vector $\\vec{s}$. Therefore, the boundaries of Cube B are:\n    *   $0 + 1/2 \\le x \\le 1 + 1/2 \\quad \\implies \\quad 1/2 \\le x \\le 3/2$\n    *   $0 + 1/2 \\le y \\le 1 + 1/2 \\quad \\implies \\quad 1/2 \\le y \\le 3/2$\n    *   $0 + 1/2 \\le z \\le 1 + 1/2 \\quad \\implies \\quad 1/2 \\le z \\le 3/2$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Region of Intersection**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the boundary conditions for both Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we find the intersection of the inequalities for each coordinate.\n\n*   **x-coordinate:** A point in the intersection must satisfy both $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $1/2 \\le x \\le 3/2$. The overlapping interval is $[1/2, 1]$.\n*   **y-coordinate:** A point in the intersection must satisfy both $0 \\le y \\le 1$ and $1/2 \\le y \\le 3/2$. The overlapping interval is $[1/2, 1]$.\n*   **z-coordinate:** A point in the intersection must satisfy both $0 \\le z \\le 1$ and $1/2 \\le z \\le 3/2$. The overlapping interval is $[1/2, 1]$.\n\nThe intersection is therefore a region defined by:\n$1/2 \\le x \\le 1$\n$1/2 \\le y \\le 1$\n$1/2 \\le z \\le 1$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe region of intersection defined in the previous step is itself a cube. We can determine its side length from the ranges of the coordinates.\n\n*   Side length in the x-direction: $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$\n*   Side length in the y-direction: $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$\n*   Side length in the z-direction: $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$\n\nThe volume of a cube is calculated as (side length)Â³.\n\n*   Volume of Intersection = $(1/2) \\times (1/2) \\times (1/2) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Coordinate System Choice:** Choosing a simple alignment for the first cube (one corner at the origin, edges along axes) greatly simplifies the calculations.\n2.  **Interpreting the Shift:** The phrasing \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is slightly ambiguous. The most plausible interpretation in the context of such problems is a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), which leads to a clean result.\n3.  **Symmetry:** The choice of which of the four main diagonals to use does not affect the final volume due to the symmetry of the cube.\n4.  **Finding the Intersection:** The intersection of two convex shapes (like cubes) is always a convex shape. Finding the intersection of their bounding inequalities for each dimension separately is a valid and straightforward method.\n\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of a cube with side length 1/2.\n\nVolume = $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
