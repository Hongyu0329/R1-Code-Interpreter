    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the origin of the modern word \"sister\".**\nThe current English word \"sister\" derives from the Old English word *sweostor*. However, its modern spelling and pronunciation have been significantly influenced by the Old Norse word for sister, which was *systir*. The interaction between the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse invaders (Vikings) led to many Old Norse words and grammatical structures being adopted into English, or influencing the evolution of existing English words. The similarity between *sweostor* and *systir* made it easy for the Norse form to reshape the English one.\n\n**Step 2: Isolate the native Old English word.**\nTo determine what the word would have become without Norse influence, we must start with the purely Old English form, which was *sweostor*. There was also a less common dialectal variant, *swuster*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the likely phonetic evolution of *sweostor* into Modern English.**\nLinguists can predict how words would have changed over time by observing regular sound shifts that occurred throughout the language's history.\n\n*   **The \"eo\" Diphthong:** In Old English *sweostor*, the \"eo\" is a diphthong (two vowel sounds in one syllable). In the transition to Middle English, the \"eo\" sound regularly changed to a simple \"e\" sound. For example, the Old English *heorte* (heart) became *herte* in Middle English, and *ceorl* (a free peasant) became *cherl*. Following this rule, *sweostor* would have first become *swester*.\n*   **The Unstressed Vowel:** The final \"o\" in *sweostor* is in an unstressed syllable. In Middle English, unstressed vowels were typically reduced to a schwa sound (/É™/), which was often written with an \"e\". This reinforces the change from *-stor* to *-ster*.\n*   **The initial \"sw-\":** The \"sw-\" sound at the beginning of a word was generally stable in English, as seen in words like *swim* (from OE *swimman*) and *swan* (from OE *swan*). It is very likely it would have been retained.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the changes and consult related languages.**\nPutting these changes together, the Old English *sweostor* would have regularly evolved into a Middle English form spelled *swester*. This would then likely have been carried into Modern English as **swester**.\n\nWe can find strong confirmation of this by looking at other West Germanic languages that are closely related to English but were not subject to the same Old Norse influence:\n*   **German:** The word for sister is *Schwester*.\n*   **Frisian** (the closest language to English): The word is *swester*.\n*   **Dutch:** The word is *zuster* (showing a related, but slightly different, evolution of the initial consonant sound).\n\nThe forms in German and Frisian are identical to our predicted native English development.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the alternative Old English form *swuster*.**\nThe variant *swuster* did evolve into the word *suster*, which was common in Middle English dialects before it was eventually outcompeted and replaced by the Norse-influenced \"sister\" around the 14th century. So, *suster* is another possibility. However, *swester* represents the most regular evolution from the more common Old English form (*sweostor*) and is strongly supported by the evidence from closely related languages. Authoritative sources like the Oxford English Dictionary explicitly state that \"The regular evolution of OE. *sweostor* would have been *swester*\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWithout the linguistic influence from Old Norse invaders, the Old English word *sweostor* would have followed the normal path of English sound changes. Based on this path and comparison with its closest linguistic relatives, the word would have become *swester*.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
