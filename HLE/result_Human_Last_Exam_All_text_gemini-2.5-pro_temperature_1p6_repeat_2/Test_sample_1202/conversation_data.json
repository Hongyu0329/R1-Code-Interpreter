    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the primary mechanism that leads to two key outcomes for duplicated genes:\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies of the gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than one being lost or silenced. The most common fate of a duplicate gene is actually its loss (through pseudogenization), so we are looking for a process that actively favors keeping both.\n    *   **Divergence:** The two copies accumulate differences in their DNA sequence, leading to them no longer being identical in structure or function.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Gene conversion.**\n    *   **Mechanism:** Gene conversion is a process where a DNA sequence of one gene copy replaces the sequence of the other homologous copy.\n    *   **Impact:** This process leads to homogenization, making the duplicate genes *more similar* to each other. It works *against* divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism responsible for both retention and divergence.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Answer Choice B: Pseudogenization.**\n    *   **Mechanism:** One of the two gene copies accumulates mutations that render it non-functional. It becomes a pseudogene.\n    *   **Impact:** This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not gene *retention*. While the sequence of the pseudogene does diverge, the process does not result in the retention of two functional genes. This is the most common fate, but it's what the mechanisms of retention must overcome.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Answer Choice C: Neofunctionalization.**\n    *   **Mechanism:** After duplication, one copy continues to perform the original function, preserving the organism's fitness. The second copy is redundant and thus free from purifying selection. It can accumulate mutations randomly. By chance, it might acquire a mutation that gives it a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection would then preserve this new gene.\n    *   **Impact:** This model explains both **retention** (one copy for the old function, one for the new) and **divergence** (the second copy must change to gain a new function). It is a valid and important mechanism. However, the evolution of a truly novel function from random mutations is considered a rare event.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Answer Choice D: Subfunctionalization.**\n    *   **Mechanism:** This model (also called the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) posits that the original, ancestral gene had multiple functions (subfunctions) or complex expression patterns (e.g., active in multiple tissues). After duplication, each copy can sustain degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations in *different* subfunctions. For example, Copy 1 loses function A but keeps function B, while Copy 2 loses function B but keeps function A.\n    *   **Impact:** This model also explains both **retention** and **divergence**. Retention occurs because both copies are now required to collectively perform the original range of functions; losing either copy would be detrimental. Divergence occurs as each copy degenerates and specializes in its remaining subfunction. Because this mechanism relies on common loss-of-function mutations rather than rare gain-of-function mutations, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more probable and widespread initial step for preserving duplicate genes.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Answer Choice E: Adaptive radiation.**\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a group of organisms into a multitude of new forms filling different ecological niches.\n    *   **Impact:** While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is a species-level process, not a molecular mechanism explaining the fate of genes within a single genome. It operates at the wrong biological scale.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for duplicate gene retention. However, subfunctionalization provides a more passive and high-probability pathway. It doesn't require the rare event of creating a new beneficial function. Instead, it relies on the much more common event of losing function through mutation. By partitioning the original functions, it quickly makes both gene copies essential, ensuring their retention. Therefore, it is considered the \"most likely\" mechanism among the given choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
