    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup**\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$, given by the equation $z^2=f(x)$ with $f(x)=2x^5+2x^3+1$.\nWe work over the field of 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, with the valuation $v$ normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\nThe goal is to find the stable reduction of this curve. The question implies that the special fiber of the stable model has at least one ordinary double point (a node), and asks for its \"thickness\".\nThe thickness of a node in a stable model is an integer $n$ such that locally at the node, the model is described by an equation of the form $UV = \\pi^n$, where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the base ring (here, $\\pi=2$).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the branch points of the curve**\nThe reduction type of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the 2-adic properties of the branch points. The branch points of $C$ are the roots of $f(x)=0$ and the point at infinity (since $\\deg(f)=5$ is odd).\nLet $\\alpha$ be a root of $f(x)=2x^5+2x^3+1=0$. If $v(\\alpha) \\ge 0$, then $\\alpha$ is a 2-adic integer. The reduction of the polynomial modulo 2 is $1=0$, which is a contradiction. So, no root is in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, all roots $\\alpha$ must have $v(\\alpha) < 0$.\n\nTo find the valuations of the roots, we analyze the Newton polygon of $f(x)$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are given by the points $(i, v(a_i))$ where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\nThe coefficients are $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$. The non-zero coefficients give the points $(5, v(2)=1)$, $(3, v(2)=1)$, and $(0, v(1)=0)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,0)$ to $(3,1)$: The slope is $m_1 = (1-0)/(3-0) = 1/3$. The horizontal length is 3. This indicates there are 3 roots with valuation $v(\\alpha) = -m_1 = -1/3$.\n2.  A segment from $(3,1)$ to $(5,1)$: The slope is $m_2 = (1-1)/(5-3) = 0$. The horizontal length is 2. This indicates there are 2 roots with valuation $v(\\alpha) = -m_2 = 0$.\nHowever, we already showed that no root can have valuation $\\ge 0$. This implies that the roots with $v(\\alpha)=0$ are not in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ but in an extension field, where they are units. Let's call these roots $\\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$. The other three roots are $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$ with $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/3$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the stable reduction**\nThe stable reduction of a curve is related to the clustering of its branch points under the 2-adic valuation. A double point (node) in the stable fiber corresponds to a partition of the branch points into two sets.\nThe set of branch points is $B = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5, \\infty\\}$.\nLet's analyze the pairwise \"distances\" $v(\\beta_1 - \\beta_2)$ for $\\beta_i \\in B$.\nLet's consider the coordinate $u=1/x$. The roots for $u$ are given by the equation $P(u) = u^5+2u^2+2=0$.\nThe valuations of the roots $u_i = 1/\\alpha_i$ can be found from the Newton polygon of $P(u)=0$. The vertices are $(5, v(1)=0)$, $(2, v(2)=1)$, $(0, v(2)=1)$.\n1.  Segment from $(0,1)$ to $(2,1)$: slope 0, length 2. Corresponds to two roots $u_4, u_5$ with $v(u_{4,5})=0$. These are the reciprocals of $\\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$.\n2.  Segment from $(2,1)$ to $(5,0)$: slope $(0-1)/(5-2)=-1/3$, length 3. Corresponds to three roots $u_1, u_2, u_3$ with $v(u_{1,2,3})=1/3$. These are the reciprocals of $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$.\nThe characteristic polynomial for the roots with $v(u)=0$ is given by the slope 0 segment. It is $Y^2+1=0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, which is $(Y+1)^2=0$. This implies the two roots $u_4, u_5$ have the same residue, 1. So $v(u_4-u_5) > 0$.\nSince $\\alpha_i = 1/u_i$ and $v(u_{4,5})=0$, we have $v(\\alpha_{4,5})=0$. The condition $v(u_4-u_5)>0$ implies $v(\\frac{1}{\\alpha_4}-\\frac{1}{\\alpha_5}) = v(\\frac{\\alpha_5-\\alpha_4}{\\alpha_4\\alpha_5}) = v(\\alpha_5-\\alpha_4) > 0$.\nThis means the branch points $\\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$ form a cluster. This cluster is separated from the other branch points (since $v(\\alpha_4 - \\alpha_i) = \\min(v(\\alpha_4), v(\\alpha_i)) = -1/3 \\le 0$ for $i=1,2,3$, and $v(\\alpha_4-\\infty)=-v(\\alpha_4)=0$).\nThis suggests that the stable reduction has a component that resolves the singularity formed by the collision of $\\alpha_4$ and $\\alpha_5$. This gives rise to a double point.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the thickness of the double point**\nThe thickness of the node is related to how \"close\" $\\alpha_4$ and $\\alpha_5$ are. A key invariant is $v((\\alpha_4-\\alpha_5)^2)$, which is the valuation of the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial $(x-\\alpha_4)(x-\\alpha_5)$.\nWe need to find $v(\\alpha_4-\\alpha_5)=v(u_4-u_5)$. Let $z=u-1$. The polynomial for $z$ is $R(z) = P(z+1)=(z+1)^5+2(z+1)^2+2 = z^5+5z^4+10z^3+12z^2+9z+5=0$.\nWe need the valuations of the roots $z_4=u_4-1$ and $z_5=u_5-1$. The Newton polygon for $R(z)$ has vertices at $(0,v(5)=0), (1,v(9)=0), (2,v(12)=2), (3,v(10)=1), (4,v(5)=0), (5,v(1)=0)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points has vertices at $(0,0), (1,0), (3,1), (4,0), (5,0)$.\n- The segment from $(1,0)$ to $(3,1)$ has slope $(1-0)/(3-1) = 1/2$ and horizontal length 2. This implies there are two roots, which must be $z_4$ and $z_5$, with $v(z_4)=v(z_5)=1/2$.\nThis tells us that $v(u_4-1)=1/2$ and $v(u_5-1)=1/2$.\nTo find $v(u_4-u_5) = v(z_4-z_5)$, we examine the characteristic polynomial for this segment. In the appropriate extension (e.g., $\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{2})$), the roots are distinct modulo the next power of the uniformizer, which leads to $v(z_4-z_5)=v(z_4)=1/2$.\nTherefore, $v(u_4-u_5)=1/2$, and $v(\\alpha_4-\\alpha_5)=1/2$.\nThe thickness of the node is an integer. For hyperelliptic curves, the thickness of a node corresponding to a pair of coalescing branch points $\\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}$ is often related to the valuation of their squared difference.\nLet's compute $v((\\alpha_4-\\alpha_5)^2)$.\n$v((\\alpha_4-\\alpha_5)^2) = 2 \\cdot v(\\alpha_4-\\alpha_5) = 2 \\cdot (1/2) = 1$.\nThis integer value is the thickness of the double point. The stable reduction consists of two components of genus 0 intersecting at one point, and another component of genus 1. The total arithmetic genus is $0+1+1=2$, as expected. The question only asks for the thickness of the double point, which our analysis suggests corresponds to the partition separating $\\{\\alpha_4, \\alpha_5\\}$ from the other branch points.\n\nThe thickness $n$ is the power of 2 in the local equation $UV=2^n$. The calculation of $v((\\alpha_4-\\alpha_5)^2)=1$ strongly indicates that the thickness is 1."
