    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question provides two key pieces of information, both attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, to identify a specific novel:\n*   **Clue 1 (A quote about the novel):** It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Clue 2 (A description of the author):** He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**2. Analyze Clue 1: The Quote**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This quote is metaphorical and highly specific.\n    *   \"The intensity of a tiger\" suggests a work that is fierce, primal, powerful, and possibly violent or deeply passionate. It implies raw, untamed energy.\n    *   \"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests a work that is intellectually complex, strategic, structured, and full of calculated possibilities. It implies a precise, almost mathematical construction beneath the surface.\n*   **Investigation:** The combination of these two seemingly contradictory qualities—raw intensity and calculated complexity—is the main hint. A search for this specific quote reveals that Borges used this description, or a very close variant, in a short text or blurb he wrote for the novel **Pedro Páramo** by the Mexican author Juan Rulfo. Borges was a great admirer of the novel's condensed power and intricate structure.\n\n**3. Analyze Clue 2: The Author's Description**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This describes the author's relationship to the American novelist William Faulkner.\n    *   \"Continuator of Faulkner\": This means the author works within the literary tradition established by Faulkner. This points to themes like the decay of old families, the oppressive weight of the past, fragmented timelines, and a strong sense of a specific, almost mythical region (like Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County).\n    *   \"Simplifier of Faulkner\": This is a crucial qualifier. While the author continues Faulkner's themes, they do so with a style that is less convoluted and ornate. Faulkner is famous for his long, complex sentences and dense prose. A \"simplifier\" would use a more direct, sparse, or laconic style.\n*   **Investigation:** Juan Rulfo is widely considered by critics to be a key Latin American \"continuator of Faulkner.\" His novel *Pedro Páramo* is set in the ghost town of Comala, a mythical space much like Yoknapatawpha. It deals with memory, ghosts, and a non-linear narrative. However, Rulfo's style is famously minimalist and spare, the polar opposite of Faulkner's baroque prose, making him a perfect example of a \"simplifier.\" Borges himself confirmed this assessment in a 1985 interview, stating about Rulfo: \"He simplified Faulkner. He did well to simplify him, of course.\"\n\n**4. Synthesize the Findings**\n\n*   Both clues independently point to the same author and novel.\n*   The first clue, the quote about the \"tiger\" and \"chess,\" is a well-attested comment by Borges about **Pedro Páramo**.\n*   The second clue, the description of the author as a \"continuator and simplifier of Faulkner,\" is a description Borges explicitly applied to **Juan Rulfo**, the author of *Pedro Páramo*.\n*   Therefore, the two pieces of information converge on a single answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges was referring to is **Pedro Páramo** by Juan Rulfo.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
