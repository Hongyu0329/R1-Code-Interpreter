The equations for the absorption cross-section $\sigma(\omega_L)$ are as follows:

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected:**

The cross-section is the sum of the contributions from N identical, non-interacting molecules. This results in a single absorption peak at the monomer frequency $\omega_0$.

$\sigma_a(\omega_L) = N \frac{\sqrt{\pi} \omega_0 \tau |\vec{d}|^2}{3\hbar c\epsilon_0} e^{-(\omega_0 - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2}$

where:
*   $N$ is the number of molecules in the chain.
*   $\omega_L$ is the central frequency of the laser pulse.
*   $\omega_0$ is the transition frequency of a single molecule.
*   $\tau$ is the pulse duration parameter.
*   $|\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
*   $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.
*   $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.
*   $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered:**

The interaction leads to the formation of delocalized exciton states, each with a specific energy and oscillator strength. The absorption spectrum is a sum of peaks corresponding to the optically allowed exciton states.

$\sigma_b(\omega_L) = \frac{2\sqrt{\pi} \tau |\vec{d}|^2}{3\hbar c\epsilon_0 (N+1)} \sum_{k=1, 3, 5, ...}^{N} \left[ \omega_k \cot^2\left(\frac{k\pi}{2(N+1)}\right) e^{-(\omega_k - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2} \right]$

where the summation is over odd integer values of $k$ from 1 to N, and the exciton transition frequency $\omega_k$ is given by:

$\omega_k = \omega_0 + \frac{2J}{\hbar} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{N+1}\right)$

Additional parameters are:
*   $J$ is the nearest-neighbor coupling energy.
*   $k$ is the exciton quantum number.
