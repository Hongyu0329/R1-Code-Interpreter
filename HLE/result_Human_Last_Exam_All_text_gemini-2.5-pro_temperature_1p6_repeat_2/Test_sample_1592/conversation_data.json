    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the location of the Waskaganish gathering place:** Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. It is situated on the southern shore of the Rupert River, right where it flows into the southern end of James Bay. Its approximate coordinates are 51.19° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude.\n\n2.  **Identify the surrounding provinces and territories:** We must consider the geographic neighbors of this part of Quebec, excluding Quebec itself as per the question.\n    *   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario lies to the west and southwest of Waskaganish. The border between Quebec and Ontario runs south from the southern coast of James Bay and then extends through the middle of James Bay and Hudson Bay to the north.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut lies to the north. Its territory includes all the islands in Hudson Bay and James Bay, such as Akimiski Island, which is located northwest of Waskaganish.\n    *   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province is far to the east and is not a close neighbor to Waskaganish.\n\n3.  **Analyze the proximity of each candidate:** Now we must compare the distance from Waskaganish to Ontario and to Nunavut.\n    *   **Distance to Ontario:** The provincial border between Quebec and Ontario is very close to Waskaganish. The land border starts at the bottom of James Bay, a relatively short distance southwest of Waskaganish. Furthermore, the Ontario coastline is directly across the southern part of James Bay from Waskaganish. The distance across this stretch of water is measurable in tens of kilometers.\n    *   **Distance to Nunavut:** The closest part of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, which is located in James Bay. The southern coast of Akimiski Island is more than 130 kilometers (over 80 miles) to the north-northwest of Waskaganish. The other islands belonging to Nunavut are even further away.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of comparison:** By comparing the distances, the border of the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the border of the territory of Nunavut. The shortest distance is from Waskaganish to the nearby Quebec-Ontario provincial border.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The question explicitly states \"outside of Quebec\".\n*   The term \"province or territory\" is used, so both types of administrative divisions must be considered.\n*   \"Closest\" refers to the shortest straight-line geographical distance to the border of the neighboring province or territory.\n*   Visualizing the location on a map is crucial. Waskaganish is on the southeastern coast of James Bay. Ontario is on the western and southern coasts. Nunavut's territory consists of the islands within the bay, which are situated further north.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the analysis is that Ontario is the closest province or territory.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
