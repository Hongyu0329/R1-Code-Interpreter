The effective electron-electron interaction for a given momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$ is described by the following Hamiltonian term:
$H_{eff}(\mathbf{q}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j, \nu_n} \left( - \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m(w_q^2 + \nu_n^2)} \right) \hat{n}_{\mathbf{q}, -\nu_n} \hat{n}_{-\mathbf{q}, \nu_n}$
where $\hat{n}_{\mathbf{q}, \nu_n}$ is the electron density operator in Matsubara frequency space, $j$ is the phonon polarization index, and $\nu_n$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.
