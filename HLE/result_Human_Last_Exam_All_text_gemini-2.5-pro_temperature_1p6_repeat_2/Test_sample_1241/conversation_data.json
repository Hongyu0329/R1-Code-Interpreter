    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem presents a system of four linear ordinary differential equations, which is a Kolmogorov-Chapman system for a continuous-time Markov process with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The equations describe the time evolution of the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of being in state $i$ at time $t$. The goal is to find the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, which represents the sum of the steady-state probabilities of being in state 0 or state 1.\n\nThe steady-state probabilities, $P_i = \\lim_{t\\to+\\infty} P_i(t)$, are the probabilities after the system has reached equilibrium. In this state, the probabilities are constant, meaning their derivatives with respect to time are zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Steady-State Assumption**: The core of solving this problem is understanding that finding probabilities at $t=+\\infty$ means we are looking for the steady-state solution. This implies setting all time derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero.\n2.  **System of Algebraic Equations**: By setting the derivatives to zero, the given system of differential equations transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n3.  **Normalization Condition**: The system of equations derived from setting $P_i'(t)=0$ is linearly dependent. To find a unique solution for the probabilities, the normalization condition $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$ must be used.\n4.  **Coefficient Accuracy**: The numerical values for the transition rates $\\lambda_{ij}$ must be substituted correctly. It's important to perform calculations like sums of coefficients (e.g., $\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}$) accurately.\n5.  **Solving the System**: The system should be solved systematically. A common method is to express all unknown probabilities in terms of one of them (e.g., $P_1$) and then use the normalization condition to find its value.\n6.  **Avoiding Rounding Errors**: To maintain precision, it is best to work with fractions as long as possible and only convert to a decimal at the final step.\n7.  **Answering the Specific Question**: The final answer required is the sum $P_0 + P_1$, not the individual probabilities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the steady-state equations.**\nAt steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$), we set $P_i'(t) = 0$. Let $P_i$ denote $P_i(+\\infty)$. The given system becomes a system of linear equations:\n1.  $-\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1 = 0$\n2.  $\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\lambda_{21}P_2 + \\lambda_{31}P_3 = 0$\n3.  $\\lambda_{12}P_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_2 = 0$\n4.  $\\lambda_{23}P_2 - \\lambda_{31}P_3 = 0$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the given rate constants.**\nGiven: $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\nThe equations become:\n1.  $-0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1 = 0$\n2.  $0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3 = 0 \\implies 0.019 P_0 - 1.05 P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n3.  $0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 = 0 \\implies 0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2 = 0$\n4.  $0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the relationships between the probabilities.**\nFrom equation (4): $0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$.\nFrom equation (3): $0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$.\nCombining these, we get $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1), express $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the normalization condition to find the values of $P_i$.**\nSubstitute the expressions for $P_0, P_2, P_3$ in terms of $P_1$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} P_1\\right) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_1 = 1 \\implies P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow, find $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\left(\\frac{19}{707}\\right) = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the required sum $P_0 + P_1$.**\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
