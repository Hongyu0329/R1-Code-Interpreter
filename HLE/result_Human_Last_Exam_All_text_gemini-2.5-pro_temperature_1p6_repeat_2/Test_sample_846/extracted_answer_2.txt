The table must mimic the photoisomerization of the azobenzene molecule. At sunrise, upon exposure to the UV light in sunlight, the table must change its shape from a relatively straight, elongated form (the *trans*-isomer) to a bent, V-shape form (the *cis*-isomer). At sunset, as darkness falls, the table must spontaneously relax and change back from the bent *cis*-form to the more stable, elongated *trans*-form.
