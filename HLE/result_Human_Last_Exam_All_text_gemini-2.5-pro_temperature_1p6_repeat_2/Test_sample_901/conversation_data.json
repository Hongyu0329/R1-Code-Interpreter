    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry is defined as (1S, 2R), which indicates a *trans* relationship between the bromo and methyl groups. In a cyclohexane ring, two substituents are trans if one is pointing \"up\" and the other is \"down\" relative to the plane of the ring.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. SN2 substitution is disfavored due to the steric bulk of the t-butoxide base. E1 and SN1 reactions are disfavored because a strong base is used, promoting the bimolecular E2 pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. It proceeds via a concerted mechanism where the base removes a proton, the C-H bond breaks, a pi bond forms, and the leaving group departs all in one step.\n*   For this to happen, the proton being removed and the leaving group must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation (dihedral angle of 180°).\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar requirement translates to the leaving group and the adjacent proton being in a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (both must be in axial positions, one pointing up and one pointing down).\n\n**3. Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   As a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane can exist as two interconverting chair conformations: one with both substituents in equatorial positions (diequatorial) and one with both in axial positions (diaxial).\n*   **Conformer A (Diequatorial):** The bromo group is equatorial (e), and the methyl group is equatorial (e).\n*   **Conformer B (Diaxial):** The bromo group is axial (a), and the methyl group is axial (a).\n*   The bulky methyl group has a strong preference for the equatorial position to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). The bromo group also prefers the equatorial position, but its preference is weaker than that of the methyl group. Therefore, **Conformer A (diequatorial) is the most stable and major conformation** at equilibrium.\n\n**4. Determine which Conformation is Reactive for E2 Elimination**\n*   For the E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (Bromo, -Br) **must be in an axial position**.\n*   **In Conformer A (the major conformer)**, the Br atom is equatorial. An equatorial leaving group does not have any adjacent anti-periplanar protons. Therefore, **Conformer A is unreactive** in an E2 reaction.\n*   **In Conformer B (the minor conformer)**, the Br atom is axial. This conformation can undergo E2 elimination.\n*   Conclusion: The reaction must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformation (Conformer B). Even though it's the minor conformer, the reaction will pull the equilibrium towards it as the product is formed (Le Châtelier's principle).\n\n**5. Identify Possible Products from the Reactive Conformation**\n*   Let's analyze the reactive diaxial conformation (Conformer B), where the Br group is axial on C1. We need to look for axial protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C6.\n*   **Proton at C2:** In the diaxial conformation, the methyl group is axial. This means the proton on C2 must be in the **equatorial** position. Since this proton is not axial, it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromo group. Therefore, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is **not possible**.\n*   **Proton at C6:** Carbon C6 has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial proton on C6** is trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) to the axial bromo group on C1.\n*   Therefore, the t-butoxide base can only remove the axial proton from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n**6. Name the Final Product**\n*   The elimination reaction forms a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains on C2, which is now adjacent to the C1 end of the new double bond.\n*   The resulting molecule is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group attached to one of the double-bonded carbons.\n*   Following IUPAC nomenclature, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, starting from the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C6, and the methyl group is on C1.\n*   The name of the product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted alkene (Zaitsev's product). Even though a bulky base was used, the stereochemical constraints of the substrate dictate that only this product can be formed via the E2 mechanism.\n\n<<<1-methylcyclohexene>>>"
