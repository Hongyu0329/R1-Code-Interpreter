    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene, a system of alternating double and single bonds over four carbon atoms.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is an alkene (a molecule with a C=C double bond).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and an alkene (or alkyne) is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of pericyclic reaction known as a [4+2] cycloaddition, where 4 pi electrons from the diene and 2 pi electrons from the alkene (called the dienophile) rearrange to form a six-membered ring.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Reactants for a Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   **Diene (Butadiene):** For the reaction to occur, butadiene must adopt an *s-cis* conformation (where the double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond). Butadiene can easily rotate into this conformation. It is an electron-rich diene, which is typical for this reaction.\n*   **Dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene):** An ideal dienophile is \"electron-poor,\" meaning it has electron-withdrawing groups attached to its double bond. Both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) are highly electronegative halogens. They withdraw electron density from the double bond through the inductive effect, making the dienophile very electron-poor and thus highly reactive towards the electron-rich diene.\n\n**3. Predict the Product Structure**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is concerted, meaning all bonds are broken and formed in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n*   **Bond Formation:** Two new single (sigma) bonds are formed. One bond forms between C1 of butadiene and one carbon of the dienophile. The second bond forms between C4 of butadiene and the other carbon of the dienophile.\n*   **Bond Re-arrangement:** The C1=C2 and C3=C4 double bonds of butadiene, and the C=C double bond of the dienophile break. A new double bond forms between C2 and C3 of the original diene.\n*   **Connectivity:** Let's trace the atoms to form the ring.\n    *   Diene: `C1(H₂)=C2(H)-C3(H)=C4(H₂)`\n    *   Dienophile: `C(F₂)=C(Cl₂)`\n    *   The reaction connects C1 of the diene to one of the dienophile carbons (e.g., C(Cl₂)) and C4 of the diene to the other dienophile carbon (C(F₂)).\n    *   This forms a six-membered ring with the atoms connected in the sequence: `-C(H)=C(H)-CH₂-C(F₂)-C(Cl₂)-CH₂-`.\n\nThe resulting structure is a cyclohexene derivative:\n```\n        H C = C H\n       /         \\\n    H₂C           CH₂\n    |             |\n  (Cl)₂C --------C(F)₂\n```\n*Careful Point:* Note that since 1,3-butadiene is a symmetric diene, it does not matter which way the unsymmetrical dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) adds; the same product is formed in either orientation.\n\n**4. Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n*   **Parent Ring:** The product contains a six-membered ring with one double bond, so the parent name is **cyclohexene**.\n*   **Numbering:** IUPAC rules require numbering the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible locants (positions 1 and 2). Then, we number around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers.\n    *   **Option A:** Number the double bond carbons as C1 and C2 such that the CCl₂ group is at C4 and the CF₂ group is at C5. The name would be **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**. The substituent locants are 4,4,5,5.\n    *   **Option B:** Number the double bond carbons as C1 and C2 such that the CF₂ group is at C4 and the CCl₂ group is at C5. The name would be **5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene**. The substituent locants are also 4,4,5,5.\n*   **Breaking the Tie:** When two numbering schemes yield the same set of locants, we use alphabetical order of the substituent names (\"chloro\" vs. \"fluoro\") to decide. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically. Therefore, the group cited first (dichloro) should be assigned the lower number.\n*   **Final Name:** Option A gives the \"dichloro\" group position 4, while Option B gives it position 5. We must choose Option A.\n\nThe final, correct IUPAC name for the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n### **Summary of Careful Points**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Correctly identify the reaction as a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Connectivity:** Be very careful when determining which atoms bond to each other to form the new ring. It's helpful to number the atoms of the reactants and trace them to the product.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** Realize that since the diene is symmetrical, there is only one possible regioisomeric product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** In this specific case, no new stereocenters are created, so stereoisomers are not a concern.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** Follow the rules strictly, especially the tie-breaking rule based on alphabetical order when locants are identical.\n\nThe product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
