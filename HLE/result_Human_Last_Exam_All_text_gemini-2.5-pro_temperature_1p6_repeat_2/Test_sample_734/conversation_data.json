    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who created a formal, technical vocabulary (\"specialized terminology\") to explain how the laws of nature could be altered by God. This vocabulary must be applicable to two distinct theological events:\n    *   **The Virgin Birth of Jesus:** A singular, miraculous event that bypasses the normal biological laws of reproduction.\n    *   **The Fall:** A systemic, foundational event that may have resulted in a permanent change to the laws governing the natural world (e.g., introducing death, decay, disease, and futility into creation).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Christian Theologian:** The person must be a recognized figure in the history of Christian thought.\n    *   **\"First developed\":** This points to an originator or a primary systematizer of the concept, not just someone who discussed it.\n    *   **\"Specialized terminology\":** We are looking for specific, defined terms, not just general descriptions of God's power.\n    *   **\"Changes in the laws of nature\":** This requires a framework that allows for natural laws to be both stable (for science and reason to work) and subject to divine alteration or suspension.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):** Augustine wrote extensively on creation, the Fall, and miracles. He argued that the natural order was changed by the Fall, introducing mortality and suffering. He also strongly defended the virgin birth. However, his explanatory framework, often involving the concept of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons), described these possibilities as being embedded in creation from the beginning by God, to be activated at the right time. While this addresses the issue, it is less about \"changing\" existing laws and more about activating latent potentials. It doesn't quite fit the description of a specialized terminology for altering natural law itself.\n\n    *   **John Calvin (1509-1564) and Martin Luther (1483-1546):** The Reformers certainly believed in both the virgin birth and the cosmic consequences of the Fall. However, their primary focus was on soteriology (salvation) and the authority of Scripture. They were generally less concerned with developing new, systematic metaphysical frameworks for how God interacts with natural law, often preferring to affirm the biblical account without extensive philosophical explanation.\n\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274):** Aquinas is the most likely candidate. As a scholastic theologian, his great project was to synthesize Christian doctrine with Aristotelian philosophy, creating a comprehensive and systematic explanation of reality. To address the scope of God's power, he formalized and extensively used a crucial distinction:\n        *   ***Potentia Dei absoluta*** **(God's absolute power):** This refers to God's sheer ability to do anything that does not involve a logical contradiction. It is the full extent of His omnipotence, unbound by any self-imposed constraints.\n        *   ***Potentia Dei ordinata*** **(God's ordained power):** This refers to the power of God as expressed through the actual order He has created and establishedâ€”the laws of nature, logic, and morality by which the universe normally operates.\n\n4.  **Apply the Terminology to the Question's Requirements:**\n\n    *   **The Virgin Birth:** This is a perfect example of God acting according to His *potentia absoluta*. He acts outside the *potentia ordinata* (the normal law of biological reproduction) to bring about a unique, miraculous result. He suspends or bypasses the normal rule without abolishing it for everyone else.\n\n    *   **The Fall:** The changes in nature at the Fall can be described as God altering the very fabric of His *potentia ordinata*. The pre-Fall created order was one ordained reality (e.g., without human death or possibly animal predation). After sin, God instituted a new *ordained* reality, one in which the \"laws of nature\" now included principles of futility, decay, and death as the norm. The system itself was re-ordained.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The distinction between absolute and ordained power did not originate in a complete vacuum with Aquinas, as earlier theologians had discussed similar ideas. However, Aquinas is the figure who systematically developed it, defined the terms with precision, and integrated them into a comprehensive theological system that became standard for centuries. Therefore, he is credited as the key developer of this \"specialized terminology.\"\n*   This framework allows theology to hold two ideas in tension: a reliable, predictable natural order that can be studied by science (governed by *potentia ordinata*) and a sovereign God who is free to act miraculously in unique ways (*potentia absoluta*) or even change the entire system.\n*   The terminology provides a precise way to differentiate between a singular \"miracle\" (an exception) and a systemic \"alteration\" (a change in the rules).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThomas Aquinas, through his systematic development and application of the terms *potentia Dei absoluta* and *potentia Dei ordinata*, was the first major Christian theologian to provide a specialized terminology that could coherently describe both singular exceptions to natural law (like the virgin birth) and systemic changes to the natural order itself (as in the aftermath of the Fall).\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
