    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 two-dimensional plane symmetry groups that describe repeating patterns in a plane. They are formally known as plane crystallographic groups.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its associated point group (or crystal class) is the group of symmetries (rotations, reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. It is obtained by considering the symmetries of the wallpaper group while ignoring the translational components.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements it contains.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose point group has exactly 2 elements.\n\n**2. Identify the 2D Crystallographic Point Groups**\n\nThere are 10 crystallographic point groups in two dimensions. Let's list them and find their orders. The notation used here is the standard Hermann-Mauguin notation.\n\n| Point Group Notation | Geometric Symmetries                  | Order (Number of Elements) |\n| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |\n| `1`                  | Identity only                           | 1                          |\n| `2`                  | 180° rotation                           | 2                          |\n| `m`                  | Reflection across a line                | 2                          |\n| `2mm`                | 180° rotation, two perpendicular reflections | 4                          |\n| `4`                  | 90° rotation                            | 4                          |\n| `4mm`                | 90° rotation, reflections               | 8                          |\n| `3`                  | 120° rotation                           | 3                          |\n| `3m`                 | 120° rotation, reflections              | 6                          |\n| `6`                  | 60° rotation                            | 6                          |\n| `6mm`                | 60° rotation, reflections               | 12                         |\n\n**3. Find the Point Groups of Order 2**\n\nFrom the table above, the point groups with an order of 2 are:\n*   **`2`**: Contains the identity and a 180° rotation.\n*   **`m`**: Contains the identity and a reflection.\n\n**4. Associate Wallpaper Groups with These Point Groups**\n\nNow, we need to identify which of the 17 wallpaper groups have `2` or `m` as their point group.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** A wallpaper group might contain symmetries like glide reflections (a reflection followed by a translation). In the point group, the translational part of a glide reflection is ignored, so it becomes a simple reflection.\n\nLet's list the 17 wallpaper groups and determine their point group:\n\n| Wallpaper Group | Point Group | Point Group Order | Has Point Group of Order 2? |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------- |\n| p1              | 1           | 1                 | No                          |\n| **p2**          | **2**       | **2**             | **Yes**                     |\n| **pm**          | **m**       | **2**             | **Yes**                     |\n| **pg**          | **m**       | **2**             | **Yes**                     |\n| **cm**          | **m**       | **2**             | **Yes**                     |\n| p2mm            | 2mm         | 4                 | No                          |\n| p2mg            | 2mm         | 4                 | No                          |\n| p2gg            | 2mm         | 4                 | No                          |\n| c2mm            | 2mm         | 4                 | No                          |\n| p4              | 4           | 4                 | No                          |\n| p4mm            | 4mm         | 8                 | No                          |\n| p4gm            | 4mm         | 8                 | No                          |\n| p3              | 3           | 3                 | No                          |\n| p3m1            | 3m          | 6                 | No                          |\n| p31m            | 3m          | 6                 | No                          |\n| p6              | 6           | 6                 | No                          |\n| p6m             | 6mm         | 12                | No                          |\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** It is important to correctly identify the point group for each wallpaper group.\n    *   For **p2**, the symmetries are translations and 2-fold rotation centers. The point group is `2`.\n    *   For **pm**, there are reflection lines. The point group is `m`.\n    *   For **pg**, the only non-translational symmetries are glide reflections. A glide reflection `g` consists of a reflection `m` and a translation `t`. The point group ignores `t`, so `g` is treated as `m`. Therefore, the point group is `m`.\n    *   For **cm**, which uses a centered lattice, there are reflection lines. The point group is `m`.\n\n**5. Count the Results**\n\nBy examining the table in the previous step, we can count the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\nThe wallpaper groups are:\n1.  `p2` (with point group `2`)\n2.  `pm` (with point group `m`)\n3.  `pg` (with point group `m`)\n4.  `cm` (with point group `m`)\n\nThere are a total of 4 such wallpaper groups.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are **4** wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2. These are **p2, pm, pg,** and **cm**.\n\n<<<4>>>"
