    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The core of the question is to identify a specific philosopher who belongs to a particular school of thought (Lviv-Warsaw School) and is known for a specific philosophical distinction (decomposing \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\").\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Terms**:\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School**: This refers to a highly influential school of logic and philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1918-1939). Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. We must look for the answer among these thinkers.\n    *   **Hallmark**: This is the general concept being analyzed. In a philosophical context, particularly in semiotics (the theory of signs), a hallmark is a type of sign or a distinguishing characteristic that indicates something. The likely Polish equivalent is *znak* (sign, mark) or *cecha* (characteristic).\n    *   **Symptoms and Signals**: This is the specific terminological distinction made by the philosopher. We need to find who used this pair of concepts to analyze the broader notion of a sign or hallmark.\n\n3.  **Surveying the Lviv-Warsaw School for the Right Candidate**:\n    *   Many members of the school worked on logic and the foundations of mathematics (e.g., Łukasiewicz, Tarski, Leśniewski). While they touched upon language, this specific semiotic distinction is not central to their most famous work.\n    *   Tadeusz Kotarbiński was known for reism (or concretism) and praxiology (the theory of efficient action).\n    *   The philosopher most famous for his deep and systematic work on the philosophy of language, meaning, and semiotics within the Lviv-Warsaw School is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**. His work extensively covers the nature of signs, language, and knowledge. This makes him the most probable candidate.\n\n4.  **Investigating Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz's Philosophy**:\n    *   A review of Ajdukiewicz's work, particularly his influential book *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), confirms that he developed a detailed theory of signs (*znak*).\n    *   Within this theory, he makes a fundamental distinction between different kinds of signs based on the nature of the link between the sign and what it signifies.\n\n### Careful Points and the Core Distinction\n\n1.  **The General Concept**: Ajdukiewicz analyzes the notion of a **sign** (*znak*), which serves as a \"hallmark\" or indication of something else.\n\n2.  **The First Type: Symptom**:\n    *   Ajdukiewicz calls a natural sign an **oznaka**, which translates to \"symptom,\" \"indication,\" or \"index.\"\n    *   The connection between a symptom and what it indicates is a **natural or causal one**. It exists independently of human rules or conventions.\n    *   **Example**: Smoke is a symptom of fire. A fever is a symptom of an illness. These relationships are discovered in the world through empirical observation.\n\n3.  **The Second Type: Signal**:\n    *   Ajdukiewicz calls a conventional sign a **sygnał**, which translates directly to \"signal.\"\n    *   The connection between a signal and what it signifies is based on **convention, agreement, or an established rule**. The meaning is assigned to the signal by a user or a community.\n    *   **Example**: A red traffic light is a signal to stop. A referee blowing a whistle is a signal of a foul in a game. Words in a language are also a form of signal, as their meanings are established by convention.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the general notion of a sign (or hallmark) into the categories of symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This distinction is a cornerstone of his semiotic theory and philosophy of language.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
