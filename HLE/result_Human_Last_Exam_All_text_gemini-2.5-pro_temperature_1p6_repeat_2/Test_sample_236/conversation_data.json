    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$)**: This is a group where the elements are equivalence classes of oriented integral homology 3-spheres (3-manifolds $M$ with the same integer homology groups as the 3-sphere $S^3$). Two such manifolds, $M_1$ and $M_2$, are considered equivalent (homology cobordant) if their disjoint union $M_1 \\sqcup (-M_2)$ bounds a 4-manifold $W$ that has the same integer homology as a 4-ball. The group operation is connected sum, and the identity element is the class of the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure that modifies the 3-sphere $S^3$ along a knot $K$. The surgery is determined by an integer coefficient, $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted by $S^3_p(K)$.\n3.  **Condition for a Homology Sphere**: The first homology group of the manifold resulting from p-surgery on a knot K is $H_1(S^3_p(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$. For this to be an integral homology sphere, its first homology group must be trivial, which means $|p|$ must be 1. Therefore, we only need to consider surgeries with coefficients $p = +1$ and $p = -1$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Knots\nWe need to list all knots with four or fewer crossings. We must also consider their mirror images if they are chiral.\n*   **0 crossings**: The unknot, $0_1$. It is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings**: There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot, $3_1$. It is chiral, so we must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (its mirror image, denoted $\\overline{3_1}$).\n*   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. It is amphichiral.\n\nSo, the list of knots to analyze is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $\\overline{3_1}$, and $4_1$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Homology Cobordism Classes from Each Knot\nWe will consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries on each of these knots and determine the corresponding element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. We will use the identity $S^3_p(\\overline{K}) = -S^3_{-p}(K)$, where $-M$ denotes the manifold $M$ with the opposite orientation.\n\n1.  **The Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ results in the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ also results in $S^3$.\n    *   Both represent the trivial element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n    *   **Elements contributed: 1 (the trivial element)**.\n\n2.  **The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$ and its mirror $\\overline{3_1}$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: This is the Poincar√© homology sphere, a well-known non-trivial homology sphere. Let's denote its class by $a$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: This is another non-trivial homology sphere, $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. Let's denote its class by $b$.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})$: Using the identity, this is $-S^3_{-1}(3_1)$, which represents the class $-b$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})$: This is $-S^3_{+1}(3_1)$, which represents the class $-a$.\n    *   It is a standard result in low-dimensional topology (provable using invariants like Heegaard Floer homology) that $a$, $b$, $-a$, and $-b$ are four distinct non-trivial elements. For instance, their Casson invariants are $\\lambda(a)=-1$, $\\lambda(b)=1$, $\\lambda(-a)=1$, $\\lambda(-b)=-1$. This shows $a \\ne b$, $a \\ne -a$, etc. The fact that $a \\ne -b$ and $b \\ne -a$ requires more advanced invariants.\n    *   **Elements contributed: 4 distinct non-trivial elements ($a, b, -a, -b$)**.\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: This is a non-trivial homology sphere. Let's denote its class by $c$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: Since the figure-eight knot is amphichiral ($4_1 = \\overline{4_1}$), we have $S^3_{-1}(4_1) = -S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. This represents the class $-c$.\n    *   Thus, the figure-eight knot gives us two elements, $c$ and $-c$. We must check if these are new.\n    *   The Casson invariant of $c = [S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$ is $\\lambda(c) = 1$. This confirms it is non-trivial.\n    *   We compare $c$ with the other elements having Casson invariant 1, which are $b$ and $-a$.\n        *   $b = [S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$\n        *   $c = [S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$\n        *   $-a = [S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})]$\n    *   It is a well-established result, demonstrable using Heegaard Floer homology (specifically, the d-invariants), that these three homology spheres are not homology cobordant to each other. The underlying manifolds are also known to be different (e.g., $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ is a Seifert-fibered space, while $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ is hyperbolic).\n    *   Therefore, $c$ and $-c$ are distinct from the elements generated by the trefoil knot.\n    *   **Elements contributed: 2 new distinct non-trivial elements ($c, -c$)**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nLet's sum the number of distinct elements found:\n*   From the unknot: 1 element (the identity).\n*   From the trefoil and its mirror: 4 distinct non-trivial elements.\n*   From the figure-eight knot: 2 new distinct non-trivial elements.\n\nTotal number of distinct elements = $1 + 4 + 2 = 7$.\n\nThe seven distinct elements are:\n1.  The trivial element, $[S^3]$.\n2.  $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$ (from the right-handed trefoil)\n3.  $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$ (from the right-handed trefoil)\n4.  $[S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})]$ (from the left-handed trefoil, inverse of the previous)\n5.  $[S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})]$ (from the left-handed trefoil, inverse of the one before that)\n6.  $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$ (from the figure-eight knot)\n7.  $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$ (from the figure-eight knot, inverse of the previous)"
