    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the molecule's composition.**\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set developed by Pople. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). The rules are different for \"heavy\" atoms (like Carbon) and for Hydrogen.\n\n*   **For a heavy atom (like Carbon):**\n    *   The number before the hyphen (`6`) describes the core orbitals. The core orbitals (1s for Carbon) are represented by a single CGF, which is a sum of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   The numbers after the hyphen (`3` and `1`) describe the valence orbitals (2s and 2p for Carbon). The valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, creating a valence double-zeta basis.\n        *   **Inner Valence:** Represented by one set of CGFs. Each CGF in this set is a sum of 3 PGFs. For Carbon, this includes one s-type function and three p-type functions (px, py, pz).\n        *   **Outer Valence:** Represented by a second set of CGFs. Each CGF in this set consists of a single PGF (`1`). For Carbon, this also includes one s-type function and three p-type functions.\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is a valence orbital.\n    *   The notation after the hyphen (`3` and `1`) applies to the 1s orbital. It is split into two parts.\n        *   **Inner part:** One CGF which is a sum of 3 PGFs.\n        *   **Outer part:** One CGF which is a single PGF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom.**\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** 1 CGF\n    *   **Inner Valence (2s, 2p):** 1 s-type CGF + 3 p-type CGFs = 4 CGFs\n    *   **Outer Valence (2s, 2p):** 1 s-type CGF + 3 p-type CGFs = 4 CGFs\n    *   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 CGFs**\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   **Inner Valence (1s):** 1 s-type CGF\n    *   **Outer Valence (1s):** 1 s-type CGF\n    *   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2 CGFs**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire molecule.**\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** 7 Carbon atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** 8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = 79 CGFs**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for **contracted** Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are also called basis functions. It does not ask for primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **Atom-Specific Rules:** The interpretation of the basis set name `6-31G` is different for second-row atoms (like C) and for hydrogen (H).\n*   **Valence Splitting:** The term \"split-valence\" means that each valence atomic orbital is represented by more than one basis function. In the case of 6-31G, it's two (double-zeta), an \"inner\" and \"outer\" set.\n*   **Shells vs. Orbitals:** Remember that a `p` shell consists of three orbitals (px, py, pz). Therefore, when the p-valence shell is described, it requires three contracted functions for each part of the split.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Ensure you are using the correct number of atoms for the specified molecule (Toluene is C7H8).\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  Identify atoms in Toluene: 7 Carbon, 8 Hydrogen.\n2.  Determine CGFs for Carbon with 6-31G: 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9.\n3.  Determine CGFs for Hydrogen with 6-31G: 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = 2.\n4.  Calculate total CGFs: (7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/C) + (8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/H) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
