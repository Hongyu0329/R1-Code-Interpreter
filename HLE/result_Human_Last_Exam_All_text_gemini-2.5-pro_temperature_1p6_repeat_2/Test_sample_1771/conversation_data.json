    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti` into its descendant forms in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the PIE Form\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. This is the core element meaning 'to track, seek out'. The Hittite and Latin cognates confirm this structure.\n*   **Laryngeal `*h₂`:** This is the \"a-coloring\" laryngeal. It has two primary effects that are relevant here:\n    1.  It colors an adjacent `*e` vowel to an `*a` vowel.\n    2.  If lost next to a vowel, it can lengthen that vowel. In this case, PIE `*eh₂` becomes Proto-Germanic `*ō`.\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie/io-`. This is a present tense suffix, which in Germanic languages will lead to the formation of a Class 1 weak verb.\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti`. This is the standard 3rd person singular present indicative active ending.\n*   **Accent:** The accent on `*...iéti` indicates that the root syllable was unstressed in PIE. This is important for a potential application of Verner's Law, but as we will see, it does not apply to the consonants in this specific word.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Proto-Germanic (PGmc) Form\n\n1.  **Vowel Change (Laryngeal Effect):** The PIE sequence `*eh₂` regularly develops into `*ā` in pre-Germanic, which then becomes PGmc long `*ō`.\n    *   `*seh₂g-` → (pre-Germanic) `*sāg-` → (PGmc) `*sōk-` (consonant change pending)\n\n2.  **Consonant Change (Grimm's Law):** This law describes a systematic shift of stop consonants from PIE to Proto-Germanic.\n    *   The initial PIE `*s` is a fricative, not a stop, so it is not affected by Grimm's Law and remains `*s`.\n    *   The PIE voiced velar stop `*g` becomes a voiceless velar stop `*k`.\n    *   Therefore, the root `*sāg-` becomes `*sōk-` in Proto-Germanic.\n\n3.  **Verner's Law Check (A Careful Point):** Verner's Law voices the voiceless fricatives that result from Grimm's Law (`*f`, `*þ`, `*h`) if the preceding vowel was unstressed in PIE. It does *not* affect the new voiceless stops (`*p`, `*t`, `*k`). It also does not apply to word-initial `*s`. Therefore, Verner's Law does not change the `*s` or the `*k` in `*sōk-`.\n\n4.  **Morphological Development (Verb Class):** The PIE `*-ie/io-` suffix forms Class 1 weak verbs in Germanic. These verbs are characterized by a `*-j-` in their suffix and an infinitive ending `*-aną`.\n    *   Combining the root `*sōk-` with the Class 1 weak verb suffix `*-janą` gives us the Proto-Germanic infinitive.\n\n**Proto-Germanic Result:** `*sōkijaną`\n\n### Step 3: Derivation from Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages\n\nWe will now trace `*sōkijaną` into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German. The most important changes are **i-umlaut**, **palatalization**, and the **High German Consonant Shift**.\n\n#### A. Old Norse (ON)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*j` in the suffix `*-janą` causes the preceding back vowel `*ō` to be fronted. In Old Norse, `*ō` becomes `*ǿ` (often written as `œ`).\n    *   `*sōk-` → `*sǿk-`\n\n2.  **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a` in Old Norse. The `*-j-` is retained.\n\n**Old Norse Result:** `sǿkja` (or `sœkja`)\n\n#### B. Old English (OE)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*j` also triggers i-umlaut in Old English. The PGmc back vowel `*ō` is fronted to `*ē`.\n    *   `*sōk-` → `*sēc-`\n\n2.  **Palatalization (A Careful Point):** In Old English, the velar consonant `*k` was palatalized (shifted to an affricate, /tʃ/) when it came before a front vowel like the newly formed `ē`.\n    *   `*sēc-` → `*sēċ-` (where `ċ` represents the /tʃ/ sound, as in \"church\")\n\n3.  **Loss of Medial `*j`:** The medial `*j` that caused the umlaut and palatalization is then lost.\n\n4.  **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` in Old English.\n\n**Old English Result:** `sēċan`\n\n#### C. Old High German (OHG)\n\n1.  **Vowel Change (Diphthongization):** Before other changes, PGmc `*ō` diphthongized to `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   `*sōk-` → `*suok-`\n\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This is the defining consonantal change of High German. Voiceless stops are affected differently depending on their position. Post-vocalic `*k` shifts to a long voiceless velar fricative, written `hh` and pronounced /xx/.\n    *   `*suok-` → `*suohh-`\n\n3.  **I-Umlaut (A Careful Point):** The `*j` in the suffix would be expected to cause umlaut on the `uo` diphthong (`uo` > `üo`). However, in OHG, umlaut is not consistently applied or marked in infinitives of this class. The standard, non-umlauted form is the most common citation form. The `*j` itself is lost.\n\n4.  **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` in Old High German (later also `-en`).\n\n**Old High German Result:** `suohhen`\n\n### Final Summary of Forms\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sǿkja` (or `sœkja`)\n*   **Old English:** `sēċan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sǿkja (or sœkja); Old English: sēċan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
