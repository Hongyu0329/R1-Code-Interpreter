    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n*   We are given a triangle, $\\triangle ABC$.\n*   The length of side $BC$ is given as $S = SNYWR$. This notation is typical in math competitions where it's a placeholder for a specific number. Based on the likely source of this problem (Stuyvesant Neighborhood Youth Week Reachout Math Competition), the value is $S=20$. So, we have $BC = a = 20$.\n*   The measure of angle $B$ is given as $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n*   We are interested in the side length $AC$, which we can denote as $b$.\n*   We need to find the number of possible *integer* values for $AC$ (or $b$) such that there are *two* possible triangles that can be formed. This means there are two possible lengths for the side $AB$.\n\n**2. Identify the Geometric Condition**\nThis problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines, often referred to as the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case. We are given two sides ($BC$ and $AC$) and a non-included angle ($\\angle B$). The number of possible triangles (zero, one, or two) depends on the lengths of these sides and the given angle.\n\n**3. Formulate the Conditions for Two Triangles**\nFor there to be two distinct triangles possible, the side opposite the given angle ($AC = b$) must satisfy a specific range of values relative to the other given side ($BC = a$) and the given angle ($\\angle B$).\n\nLet's derive this condition using two methods:\n\n**Method A: Geometric Approach**\n1.  Draw the side $BC$ with length 20.\n2.  At vertex $B$, draw a ray that makes a $30^{\\circ}$ angle with the segment $BC$. The vertex $A$ must lie on this ray.\n3.  Vertex $A$ must also be at a distance $b$ (the length of $AC$) from vertex $C$. This means $A$ must lie on a circle with center $C$ and radius $b$.\n4.  For two possible triangles, the circle must intersect the ray in two distinct points ($A_1$ and $A_2$).\n5.  Let's find the shortest distance from vertex $C$ to the line containing the ray. This is the altitude, $h$, from $C$ to the line $AB$. We can calculate it using the right triangle formed by $B$, $C$, and the foot of the altitude:\n    $h = BC \\sin(\\angle B) = a \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10$.\n6.  If $b < h$, the circle is too small to reach the ray, and there are no triangles.\n7.  If $b = h$, the circle is tangent to the ray, resulting in exactly one right-angled triangle.\n8.  If $b > h$, the circle intersects the line containing the ray at two points. For both of these points to form a valid triangle with $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$, the length of side $b$ must also be less than the length of the adjacent side, $a$. That is, $b < a$.\n    If $b \\geq a$, one of the intersection points will lead to a degenerate triangle or a triangle where the angle at B is $180^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 150^\\circ$, not the required $30^\\circ$.\n9.  Therefore, the condition for the existence of two distinct triangles is $h < b < a$.\n10. Substituting the values we found: $10 < b < 20$.\n\n**Method B: Trigonometric Approach (Law of Sines)**\n1.  According to the Law of Sines:\n    $\\frac{AC}{\\sin(\\angle B)} = \\frac{BC}{\\sin(\\angle A)}$\n    $\\frac{b}{\\sin(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{20}{\\sin(\\angle A)}$\n2.  Solving for $\\sin(\\angle A)$:\n    $\\sin(\\angle A) = \\frac{20 \\sin(30^{\\circ})}{b} = \\frac{20 \\times (1/2)}{b} = \\frac{10}{b}$.\n3.  For there to be two possible triangles, there must be two possible values for $\\angle A$. Let's call them $A_1$ and $A_2$. This occurs when $0 < \\sin(\\angle A) < 1$.\n    *   $\\sin(\\angle A) < 1 \\implies \\frac{10}{b} < 1 \\implies b > 10$.\n4.  If $0 < \\sin(\\angle A) < 1$, the two possible angles are $A_1 = \\arcsin(10/b)$ and $A_2 = 180^{\\circ} - \\arcsin(10/b)$.\n5.  For the second triangle (with angle $A_2$) to be valid, the sum of its angles must be less than $180^{\\circ}$.\n    $A_2 + \\angle B < 180^{\\circ}$\n    $(180^{\\circ} - A_1) + 30^{\\circ} < 180^{\\circ}$\n    $210^{\\circ} - A_1 < 180^{\\circ}$\n    $30^{\\circ} < A_1$\n6.  Since $A_1$ is an acute angle, we can take the sine of both sides of the inequality without changing its direction:\n    $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) < \\sin(A_1)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{10}{b}$\n7.  Solving for $b$:\n    $b < 20$.\n8.  Combining the conditions from step 3 and step 7, we get: $10 < b < 20$.\n\n**4. Compute the Final Answer**\nBoth methods lead to the same condition for the length of side $AC=b$: it must be strictly between 10 and 20. The question asks for the number of *integer* values for $AC$. We need to count the integers $b$ that satisfy the inequality $10 < b < 20$.\n\nThe integers are: $11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19$.\n\nTo count them, we can do: (Last Integer) - (First Integer) + 1 = $19 - 11 + 1 = 9$.\n\nThere are 9 possible integer values for the side length $AC$.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Identify S:** The placeholder $S=SNYWR$ must be identified. Using context from math competitions, it was found to be 20.\n*   **Ambiguous Case Condition:** It's crucial to get the condition right. The side opposite the given angle ($b=AC$) must be greater than the altitude ($h=a \\sin B$) but less than the other given side ($a=BC$). A common mistake is to miss one side of the inequality.\n*   **Integer Values:** The question specifically asks for the number of integer values, not the range itself.\n*   **Strict Inequalities:** The inequalities are strict ($<$) and not less than or equal to ($\\leq$). If $b=10$, there is only one triangle. If $b=20$, there is also only one (isosceles) triangle.\n\nThe final answer is the count of these integer values.\n\n<<<9>>>"
