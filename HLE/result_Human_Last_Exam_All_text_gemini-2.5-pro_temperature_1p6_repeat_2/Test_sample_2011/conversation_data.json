    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find the maximum number of distinct integers `k` such that a clique of size `k` (denoted as `K_k`) exists as an induced subgraph within a single graph `G` that has exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n\n**2. Understand Key Terminology**\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices `|V|` is 128.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is often denoted `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from the original graph `G` that connect pairs of vertices within `S`.\n*   **\"Clique sizes that can simultaneously appear\"**: This means we are looking for a single graph `G` that contains all these different-sized cliques.\n*   **\"Maximum possible number of different clique sizes\"**: We need to find a graph `G` that maximizes the count of unique clique sizes it contains.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Logical Steps**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The meaning of \"induced clique\".**\n    Let's analyze what it means for a graph `G` to have an induced subgraph that is a `K_k`.\n    Suppose we have a set `S` of `k` vertices in `G`. For the induced subgraph `G[S]` to be a `K_k`, it means that for every pair of distinct vertices `u, v` in `S`, there must be an edge between them in `G[S]`. By the definition of an induced subgraph, this is true if and only if there is an edge between them in the original graph `G`.\n    This leads to a crucial simplification: A set of vertices `S` induces a `K_k` if and only if `S` itself is a clique of size `k` in the graph `G`.\n    Therefore, the question can be rephrased as: \"Determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist in a single graph with 128 vertices.\"\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Establishing an Upper Bound.**\n    Let `G` be any graph on `n=128` vertices.\n    A clique is a set of vertices. The size of a clique, `k`, must be a positive integer.\n    Since the total number of vertices in the graph is 128, the largest possible clique cannot have more than 128 vertices.\n    So, any clique size `k` must satisfy the condition `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\n    The set of all possible clique sizes that can exist in any such graph is therefore a subset of `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n    The number of different clique sizes is the size of this set. The maximum possible size of a subset of `{1, 2, ..., 128}` is 128.\n    This means the answer can be no more than 128.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Proving the Upper Bound is Achievable.**\n    To show that 128 is the maximum possible number, we must demonstrate that there exists at least one graph on 128 vertices that actually contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n    Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_128`. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    Let's check if `K_128` has cliques of all possible sizes:\n    *   **Clique of size 1:** Pick any single vertex. This is a `K_1`.\n    *   **Clique of size 2:** Pick any two vertices. Since all vertices are connected, they form an edge, which is a `K_2`.\n    *   ...\n    *   **Clique of size k (for any 1 ≤ k ≤ 128):** Choose any subset of `k` vertices from `K_128`. Since all vertices in the graph are connected to each other, all vertices in this subset are also connected to each other. By definition, this subset of `k` vertices forms a clique of size `k`.\n    *   **Clique of size 128:** The set of all 128 vertices itself forms a `K_128`.\n\n    Since we can find a clique for every integer size `k` from 1 to 128 in the graph `K_128`, this specific graph contains 128 different clique sizes.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n1.  The number of different clique sizes in a graph on 128 vertices cannot exceed 128.\n2.  We have constructed a graph, the complete graph `K_128`, which contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128, thus achieving a total of 128 different clique sizes.\n\nCombining these two points, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
