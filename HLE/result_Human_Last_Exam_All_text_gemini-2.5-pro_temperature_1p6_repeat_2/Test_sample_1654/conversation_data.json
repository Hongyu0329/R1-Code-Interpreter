    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question focuses on Anton Chekhov's short story \"The Chameleon\" and the symbolic descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat.\n2.  **Understand the Symbolism:** The question correctly states that the coat and Otchumyelov's actions with it (taking it off, putting it on) symbolize his changing mentality. He feels \"hot\" and removes the coat when he feels powerful and is confronting someone of lower social status. He feels a \"chill\" and puts the coat on when he fears he might be offending someone powerful, like General Zhigalov.\n3.  **Task Requirement:** The task is to count the exact number of times Chekhov explicitly describes an action with the coat or its state in relation to Otchumyelov's shifting mood.\n4.  **Chronological Review of the Story:** We must go through the story's events and find each mention of the coat.\n\n    *   **Instance 1 (Initial State):** The story opens with Otchumyelov walking across the market square. The text describes him \"wearing a new overcoat\". This sets the baseline for his character's appearance and authority before the incident unfolds.\n    *   **Instance 2 (First Shift):** After confronting Hryukin and deciding to punish the dog's owner, Otchumyelov feels powerful and hot-headed. He says, \"It's hot!\" and **\"takes off his overcoat.\"** This is the first action reflecting a shift in his state.\n    *   **Instance 3 (Second Shift):** Someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov is immediately fearful. He feels a chill and says to the policeman Yeldyrin, **\"...help me on with my greatcoat...\"**. This action shows his sudden deference and fear.\n    *   **Instance 4 (Third Shift):** Yeldyrin remarks that the General's dogs are mostly pointers. Otchumyelov's confidence returns, and he again feels hot under the collar. He commands Yeldyrin, **\"Take the coat off me...\"**. This marks another reversal.\n    *   **Instance 5 (Fourth Shift):** A voice in the crowd insists the dog is indeed the General's. Fear grips Otchumyelov once more. He shivers and tells Yeldyrin, **\"Help me on with my greatcoat... the wind's getting up... I'm cold...\"**. He puts the coat back on to shield himself from the perceived \"chill\" of authority.\n    *   **Instance 6 (Final Action):** After it is revealed the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother, Otchumyelov's opinion settles in favor of the dog. As he leaves the scene, his authority secure, he **\"wrapped himself in his greatcoat\"** and continues his way. This final act re-establishes his official persona.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **What Constitutes a \"Description\"?** We must count not just the word \"coat\" but every distinct scene where an action involving the coat (putting on, taking off, wearing, wrapping) is described.\n*   **Consistency:** The pattern is consistent: the coat comes off when he feels bold and superior, and it goes on when he feels fearful and subservient.\n*   **Counting All Instances:** It is important to include the initial description of him wearing the coat and the final action of him wrapping it around himself, as these frame the central, shifting actions. Each of these six instances is a deliberate authorial choice to highlight the character's state of mind.\n\nBy methodically tracking each instance, we can arrive at a definitive number.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, Chekhov describes Otchumyelov's coat and his actions with it a total of six times to symbolize his changing mentality.\n\n<<<6>>>"
