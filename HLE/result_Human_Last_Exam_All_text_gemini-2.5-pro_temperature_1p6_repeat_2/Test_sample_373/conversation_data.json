    "This problem requires us to calculate the probability of a specific edge, the bottleneck edge, being selected during a single round of a randomized uniform gossiping algorithm on a 10-node barbell graph.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of a 10-node barbell graph.**\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge.\n*   Total nodes = 10.\n*   This means the two complete graphs must each have 10 / 2 = 5 nodes. Let's call these cliques C1 and C2. Both are complete graphs `K_5`.\n*   A single edge, which we call the \"bottleneck edge\" `e_b`, connects one node from C1 to one node from C2. Let's call the nodes connected by this edge `u` (in C1) and `v` (in C2).\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"Randomized Uniform Gossiping\" process.**\nThe gossiping protocol for a single round consists of two stages:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all nodes in the graph. Since there are 10 nodes, the probability of selecting any specific node is `1/10`.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to gossip with. The probability of it choosing a specific neighbor is `1 / d`, where `d` is the degree (number of neighbors) of the selected node.\n\nThe \"sampled edge\" is the edge between the node selected in stage 1 and the neighbor chosen in stage 2.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the degrees of the relevant nodes.**\nWe need to find the degrees of the two nodes `u` and `v` that are connected by the bottleneck edge.\n*   **Degree of node `u` (in C1):**\n    *   In a complete graph `K_5`, each node is connected to the other 4 nodes. So, `u` has 4 neighbors within its own clique C1.\n    *   Additionally, `u` is connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the total degree of `u` is `deg(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Degree of node `v` (in C2):**\n    *   Similarly, node `v` has 4 neighbors within its clique C2.\n    *   It is also connected to `u` via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the total degree of `v` is `deg(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n*(For completeness, any other node in C1 or C2 that is not part of the bottleneck connection has a degree of 4, as it is only connected to the other 4 nodes within its own `K_5` clique.)*\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge `e_b = (u, v)`.**\nThe bottleneck edge `(u, v)` can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  **Node `u` is selected first, and then it chooses neighbor `v`:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node `u` is `P(u_selected) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given `u` is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor `v` is `P(u_chooses_v) = 1 / deg(u) = 1/5`.\n    *   The probability of this entire event is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n2.  **Node `v` is selected first, and then it chooses neighbor `u`:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node `v` is `P(v_selected) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given `v` is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor `u` is `P(v_chooses_u) = 1 / deg(v) = 1/5`.\n    *   The probability of this entire event is `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n`P(sampling e_b) = P(u selected, chooses v) + P(v selected, chooses u)`\n`P(sampling e_b) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe final probability is `1/25`, which is equivalent to `0.04`.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
