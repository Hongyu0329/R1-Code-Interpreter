    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Naturally Occurring Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The ones that occur naturally on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n*(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally and is therefore excluded from this analysis.)*\n\n**Step 2: Define \"All Terrestrial Matter\"**\nThe question asks for the abundance as a percentage of all matter on Earth. This includes the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere (oceans, water), and lithosphere (crust, mantle, core).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nWe need to consider the total amount of each gas on the entire planet. The year 2002 is specified, but the relative abundances of these elements on a planetary scale do not change meaningfully in such a short period.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** This is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere by volume. A significant amount of the isotope Argon-40 is continuously produced in the Earth's crust and mantle by the radioactive decay of Potassium-40. It is by far the most common noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere, at about 18 parts per million (ppm). It is very rare in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant in the atmosphere (about 5 ppm). Like Argon, it is also produced by radioactive decay (alpha decay of uranium and thorium) in the crust. However, being very light, it escapes from the atmosphere into space, which limits its overall concentration.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Significantly rarer than the previous gases, with an atmospheric concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** This is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases. Its concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low, at about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion). Its abundance in the Earth's crust is also exceptionally low.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is fundamentally different from the other noble gases on this list.\n*   **Radioactivity and Short Half-Life:** All isotopes of Radon are highly radioactive. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Transient Abundance:** Radon is not a primordial gas that has been on Earth since its formation. Instead, it is continuously generated as a product in the radioactive decay chains of uranium and thorium, which are found in the Earth's crust. Because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates. Its presence is transient, and its overall abundance at any given moment is extremely small.\n*   **Comparison:** While the total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is trillions of kilograms, the total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any one time is estimated to be only a few kilograms. Even when including the Radon in the Earth's crust, its total mass is minuscule and many orders of magnitude less than that of Xenon.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  The question asks for the rarest gas in *all terrestrial matter*, not just the atmosphere. However, even considering crustal abundances, the conclusion does not change.\n2.  The key distinction is between stable gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and the radioactive gas (Rn).\n3.  Because of its extremely short half-life and rapid decay, the steady-state quantity of Radon on Earth at any moment is exceptionally low, making it the rarest of all the noble gases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas. However, the radioactive gas Radon, due to its very short half-life, exists in far smaller quantities at any given time. Therefore, Radon is the absolute rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
