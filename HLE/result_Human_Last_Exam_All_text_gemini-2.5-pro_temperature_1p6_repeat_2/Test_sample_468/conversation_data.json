    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key components of the question.**\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information about the insect genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*:\n1.  The currently used common name for the genus within its native range.\n2.  The year this common name was officially coined.\nThe answer must be presented in the format: \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Step 2: Research the genus *Perdita*.**\n*   **Taxonomy:** *Perdita* is a large genus of small solitary bees in the family Andrenidae.\n*   **Native Range:** They are native to North and Central America, with the greatest species diversity found in the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n*   **Characteristics:** These bees are notably small, some being among the world's smallest bees. They are often oligolectic, meaning they specialize in collecting pollen from a limited number of plant species. Their small size and often iridescent colors are key features.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the common name.**\n*   A search of reliable entomological sources, including university extension websites, insect identification guides like BugGuide.net, and conservation organizations like the Xerces Society, consistently identifies the common name for the genus *Perdita* as **\"Fairy Bees\"**.\n*   This name is fitting due to their diminutive size and delicate, often colorful appearance. It is the most specific and widely accepted common name currently in use for the entire genus in North America. While they might be descriptively called \"tiny desert bees,\" \"Fairy Bees\" is the established proper common name.\n\n**Step 4: Determine when the name was coined.**\n*   Pinpointing the origin of a common name requires finding the first published instance where the name was proposed or used in an authoritative context.\n*   Research into the etymology of \"Fairy Bees\" leads to the work of Dr. Jerome G. Rozen, Jr., an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History and a leading expert on bee biology.\n*   In a scientific paper published in 1996, Dr. Rozen formally proposed this name.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to locate the exact publication to confirm the date and the explicit act of coining the name. The paper is: Rozen, J. G., Jr. (1996). \"Phylogenetic analysis of the cleptoparasitic bees of the tribe Neolarrini (Apoidea: Formicidae: Nomadinae).\" *American Museum Novitates*, 3144: 1â€“18.\n*   Within this publication, Rozen states, \"...bees of the genus *Perdita*, **hereby dubbed fairy bees** because they are diminutive and often iridescent...\". This sentence is a clear and intentional coining of the term.\n*   Therefore, the year the name was coined is **1996**.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer in the correct format.**\n*   Combine the common name and the year of its coining as requested.\n*   Common Name: Fairy Bees\n*   Year Coined: 1996\n*   Formatted Answer: \"Fairy Bees, 1996\"\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1996>>>"
