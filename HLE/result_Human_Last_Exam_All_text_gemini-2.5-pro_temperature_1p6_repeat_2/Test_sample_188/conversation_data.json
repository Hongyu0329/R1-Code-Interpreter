    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The goal is to find the maximum possible length (in characters) of a secret message. This message is encrypted using the symbols in the book *Ching*, and the characters for the message come from an alphabet defined by the book *Shu*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Encryption Source (Ching):**\n    *   The *Ching* contains a total of **9999 symbols**. These 9999 symbols constitute the entire encrypted message.\n    *   The symbols are of the \"yinyang-wuxing\" type.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Message Alphabet (Shu):**\n    *   The message is written using characters from the *Shu*.\n    *   The *Shu* uses **120 unique characters**. This means the alphabet for the secret message has 120 distinct items that need to be represented.\n\n4.  **Determine the Building Blocks of the Encryption Code:**\n    *   The problem states the symbols are \"yinyang-wuxing\". We need to find out how many unique types of these symbols exist.\n    *   **Yinyang** has 2 possibilities (yin and yang).\n    *   **Wuxing** (The Five Elements/Phases) has 5 possibilities (water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   The number of unique symbol types is the product of these possibilities: 2 (yinyang) Ã— 5 (wuxing) = **10 unique symbol types**.\n    *   These 10 unique symbol types are the fundamental units (like 0 and 1 in binary) used to build the code.\n\n5.  **Determine the Encoding Scheme:**\n    *   We need to represent 120 different characters using a code made from the 10 available symbol types. A simple one-to-one mapping is not possible because we have more characters (120) than symbol types (10).\n    *   Therefore, a sequence of symbols must be used to represent a single character. Let's call the length of this sequence `L`.\n    *   The number of combinations possible with a sequence of length `L` using 10 unique symbols is `10^L`.\n    *   To represent all 120 characters, the number of combinations must be at least 120. So, we must find the smallest integer `L` that satisfies `10^L >= 120`.\n    *   Let's test values for `L`:\n        *   If `L = 1`, `10^1 = 10`. This is less than 120 (not enough combinations).\n        *   If `L = 2`, `10^2 = 100`. This is still less than 120 (not enough combinations).\n        *   If `L = 3`, `10^3 = 1000`. This is greater than 120 (enough combinations).\n    *   Thus, the most efficient encoding requires a sequence of **3 symbols** from the *Ching* to represent one character of the secret message.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   The entire encrypted text in the *Ching* consists of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each character of the final message is encoded by 3 of these symbols.\n    *   To find the total number of characters in the message, we divide the total number of available symbols by the number of symbols required per character.\n    *   Maximum Message Length = (Total Symbols in Ching) / (Symbols per Character)\n    *   Maximum Message Length = 9999 / 3 = 3333 characters.\n\n7.  **Identify and Disregard Irrelevant Information:**\n    *   The detail that the *Shu* contains \"around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\" is context. The crucial number is the 120 unique characters.\n    *   The computer vision recognition time (12 ms) and the computation times for integers and floats (10 ns, 30 ns) are technical details unrelated to the core logic of the encryption code. They are included as distractors.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing between total symbols and unique symbol types:** The *Ching* has 9999 symbols in total, but these are drawn from a set of only 10 unique types (yin-water, yang-fire, etc.).\n*   **Finding the minimum encoding length:** To find the *maximum* message length, you must use the most efficient (i.e., shortest) possible encoding for each character. This means finding the smallest `L` for which `10^L >= 120`.\n*   **Recognizing distractors:** The timing information (ms, ns) is irrelevant to the problem, which is about information theory, not computation speed.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, the maximum length of the secret message is calculated by dividing the total number of symbols available for the encryption by the number of symbols needed to represent a single character.\n\nFinal Calculation: 9999 symbols / 3 symbols per character = **3333 characters**.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
