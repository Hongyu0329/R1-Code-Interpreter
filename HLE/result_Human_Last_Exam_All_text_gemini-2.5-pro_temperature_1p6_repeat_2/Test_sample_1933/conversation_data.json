    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a specific fragment of First-Order Logic.\n*   **Schema S**: The schema contains 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n*   **Logic Fragment**: The logic is denoted by $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. This means we are working with First-Order Logic over the schema S, and the only allowed logical constructs are:\n    *   Existential quantifier ($\\exists$)\n    *   Conjunction ($\\land$)\n    *   The constants True ($\\top$) and False ($\\bot$)\n    *   Atomic formulas of the form $P_i(x)$.\n*   **VC Dimension**: In this context, the concepts are subsets of a model's domain. A formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable defines a concept, which is the set of elements $\\{a\\}$ in the domain for which $\\phi(a)$ is true. The VC dimension is the maximum size $d$ of a set of elements $X$ that can be \"shattered\" by the concepts definable in the logic. A set $X$ is shattered if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a concept (i.e., a formula $\\phi(x)$ and a model $M$) that \"picks out\" exactly $Y$ from $X$. That is, the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ intersected with $X$ is equal to $Y$. For shattering a set $X$, the model $M$ must be fixed.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Concepts\nThe core of the problem is to understand what kind of sets can be defined by the formulas in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. Let's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable `x`.\n\nAny formula in this logic is built from atomic formulas like $P_i(y)$ using only $\\land$ and $\\exists$. Any variable other than `x` must be bound by an existential quantifier.\n\nConsider a formula like $\\phi(x) = \\exists y . (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y))$. Using logical equivalences, this can be rewritten as $P_1(x) \\land (\\exists y . P_2(y))$.\nThe part $P_1(x)$ depends on the free variable `x`.\nThe part $\\exists y . P_2(y)$ is a sentence (it has no free variables). For any given model, a sentence is either true or false for the entire model.\n\nThis property is general. Any formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment is equivalent to a formula of the form:\n$C \\land \\psi(x)$\nwhere:\n*   $\\psi(x)$ is a quantifier-free formula with the free variable `x`. In our fragment, this means $\\psi(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas: $\\psi(x) = P_{i_1}(x) \\land P_{i_2}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_m}(x)$.\n*   $C$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n\nIn a specific model $M$, the sentence $C$ evaluates to either true or false.\n*   If $M \\not\\models C$, the formula $C \\land \\psi(x)$ is false for any element, defining the empty set concept, which corresponds to the logical constant $\\bot$.\n*   If $M \\models C$, the formula defines the same set as $\\psi(x)$. The set defined by $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ is precisely the intersection of the sets defined by each $P_i(x)$ for $i \\in I$. Let $P_i^M$ be the interpretation of the predicate $P_i$ in model $M$ (a subset of the domain). Then the formula defines the set $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\n\nThe constants $\\top$ and $\\bot$ are also explicitly included. $\\top$ corresponds to the entire domain (an empty intersection, where $I = \\emptyset$), and $\\bot$ corresponds to the empty set.\n\nSo, for any given model $M$, the class of concepts we can define is the set of all possible intersections of the four base sets $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M$, plus the empty set.\nThe problem of finding the VC dimension of the logic boils down to finding the VC dimension of the hypothesis class formed by taking all intersections of 4 base sets.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the VC Dimension of Intersections of k Sets\nIt is a classical result that the VC dimension of the hypothesis class consisting of all intersections of $k$ base sets is exactly $k$. Here, we have $k=4$ predicates, so we expect the VC dimension to be 4. Let's prove this.\n\n**Part 1: The VC dimension is at least 4 (Lower Bound)**\nWe need to show that we can shatter a set of size 4. Let $X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We must construct a model $M$ (i.e., define the interpretations of $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$) that shatters $X$.\n*   Let the domain of our model be $D=X$.\n*   Define the interpretation of the predicates (our base sets) as follows:\n    *   $P_1^M = X \\setminus \\{a_1\\} = \\{a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$\n    *   $P_2^M = X \\setminus \\{a_2\\} = \\{a_1, a_3, a_4\\}$\n    *   $P_3^M = X \\setminus \\{a_3\\} = \\{a_1, a_2, a_4\\}$\n    *   $P_4^M = X \\setminus \\{a_4\\} = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$\n\nNow, for any desired subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we need to find an intersection of these sets that equals $Y$.\nLet $I_Y = \\{i \\mid a_i \\notin Y\\}$. Consider the concept defined by the intersection $C_Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M$.\nAn element $a_j \\in X$ belongs to $C_Y$ if and only if $a_j \\in P_i^M$ for all $i \\in I_Y$. By our construction, this means $a_j \\neq a_i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$, which is equivalent to $j \\notin I_Y$. By definition of $I_Y$, this is equivalent to $a_j \\in Y$.\nSo, $C_Y$ is precisely the set $Y$. Since we can form a concept for every subset $Y$ of $X$, the set $X$ is shattered.\nTherefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Part 2: The VC dimension is at most 4 (Upper Bound)**\nWe need to show that no set of size 5 can be shattered. Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points.\nLet the four base concepts be $H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4$. For each element $x_j \\in X$, we can associate it with a binary vector $v_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$, where the $i$-th component of $v_j$ is 1 if $x_j \\in H_i$ and 0 otherwise.\nThis gives us 5 vectors in the 4-dimensional vector space $\\mathbb{F}_2^4$. Since the number of vectors (5) is greater than the dimension of the space (4), these vectors must be linearly dependent over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This means there exists a non-empty subset of these vectors that sums to the zero vector.\nLet $X_0 \\subseteq X$ be a non-empty subset such that $\\sum_{x \\in X_0} v(x) = \\vec{0} \\pmod 2$.\n\nThis linear dependency means that it's impossible to generate all $2^5=32$ subsets of $X$ using intersections of $H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4$. A detailed proof shows:\n*   If $|X_0|$ is odd, the subset $X_0$ itself cannot be generated by an intersection.\n*   If $|X_0|$ is even, the subset $X_0 \\setminus \\{x\\}$ for any $x \\in X_0$ cannot be generated.\nIn either case, there is at least one subset of $X$ that cannot be realized as a concept. Thus, $X$ cannot be shattered.\nSince no set of size 5 can be shattered, the VC dimension must be less than 5.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nFrom our analysis:\n*   The VC dimension is $\\ge 4$.\n*   The VC dimension is $\\le 4$.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
