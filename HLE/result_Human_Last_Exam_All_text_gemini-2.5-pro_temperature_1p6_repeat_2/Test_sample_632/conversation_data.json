    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n    *   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Timeframe:** Until 1950.\n    *   **Agent:** The \"city administration\".\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Information Gathering:**\n    *   The primary features of the Piazza today are the Pantheon itself, the Renaissance fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) topped with the Macuteo Obelisk, and the surrounding buildings. We need to find something that is *no longer there*.\n    *   A search into the history of the Piazza, specifically focusing on changes in the early to mid-20th century, is necessary. Old photographs are an excellent resource for this.\n\n3.  **Investigating Potential Features:**\n    *   **Buildings/Structures:** Were any major buildings demolished? Historical records do not show a significant building being removed from the square itself in 1950. The core layout of the surrounding palazzi remains.\n    *   **Monuments:** Was part of the fountain or another monument removed? No, the fountain by Giacomo Della Porta with the obelisk added by Pope Clement XI is the same one we see today.\n    *   **Infrastructure:** This is a key area to investigate. How did people and goods move through the square? Looking at photos from the late 19th and early 20th centuries reveals a significant piece of infrastructure that is absent today: **tram tracks**.\n\n4.  **Confirming the Feature:**\n    *   Historical maps and photographs of Rome from before 1950 clearly show a tram line running directly through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    *   This was part of Rome's extensive tram network. The specific line was often referred to as \"la circolare\" (the circular line).\n    *   The sight of a modern tram passing directly in front of the ancient Pantheon was a very distinctive and unique visual juxtaposition, fitting the description of a \"unique architectural feature\" in a broader sense, as it fundamentally defined the space's character and appearance.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Removal and Date:**\n    *   After World War II, the Rome city administration made a strategic decision to dismantle many of the tram lines, especially in the narrow and historically sensitive streets of the city center.\n    *   They were largely replaced by buses, which were seen as more flexible and less obtrusive.\n    *   The process of removing tracks from the historic center occurred throughout the late 1940s and 1950s. The removal of the tracks from the Piazza della Rotonda falls squarely within this period, aligning with the \"until 1950\" detail in the question.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   The term \"architectural feature\" should be interpreted broadly to include significant infrastructure that shapes the visual and functional character of a public square.\n*   The exact date \"1950\" is representative of a period of change. The removal of Rome's central tram lines was a process that spanned a few years after the war.\n*   The uniqueness of the feature lay in the striking contrast between the ancient Roman temple and the modern, industrial mode of transportation running just feet away from its portico.\n*   It's important to differentiate this removed feature from the permanent structures like the Pantheon and the fountain, which were never removed.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of historical photographs and urban development records for Rome, the unique feature that was present in the Piazza della Rotonda until the mid-20th century and was subsequently removed by the city administration was the tramway line.\n\n<<<A tramway line that ran through the square.>>>"
