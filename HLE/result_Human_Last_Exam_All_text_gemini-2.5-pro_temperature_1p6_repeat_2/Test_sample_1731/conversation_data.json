    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Connecting Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics**\n\nLarge Deviation Theory (LDT), through theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff, provides a mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics. The core idea is that the equilibrium state of a system is the overwhelmingly most probable macroscopic state. The probability of observing any other macroscopic state (a \"large deviation\") is exponentially small.\n\n*   **Boltzmann's Principle:** The probability of a macrostate is proportional to the number of microstates (W) corresponding to it. $P(\\text{macrostate}) \\propto W$.\n*   **Entropy:** Entropy is defined as $S = k_B \\ln W$. Therefore, $P(\\text{macrostate}) \\propto e^{S/k_B}$.\n*   **Equilibrium:** The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the entropy S, subject to the physical constraints of the system (like fixed energy, volume, etc.).\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems formalize this by showing that the probability of a large deviation decays exponentially with a \"rate function\". In statistical mechanics, this rate function is directly related to entropy or free energy. Thus, \"using LDT\" means applying the principle of maximum entropy to find the equilibrium state.\n\n**2. Defining the System and the Correct Entropy Formula**\n\n*   **System:** We are considering a gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume V. Photons are bosons, meaning they are indistinguishable particles and any number of them can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Constraint:** For a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (e.g., black-body radiation), the total energy is conserved (or has a fixed mean value), but the total number of photons is not conserved. This corresponds to a chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n*   **Entropy for Bosons:** The crucial point is to use the correct entropy formula for indistinguishable bosons. If there are $g_i$ quantum states at energy level $\\epsilon_i$ (degeneracy), and $n_i$ photons occupy this level, the number of ways to arrange them is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula $W_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$.\n    The total entropy is $S = k_B \\ln W = k_B \\ln \\prod_i W_i = k_B \\sum_i \\ln W_i$.\n    Using Stirling's approximation for large $n_i$ and $g_i$, the entropy becomes:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i g_i [(\\bar{n}_i+1)\\ln(\\bar{n}_i+1) - \\bar{n}_i \\ln \\bar{n}_i]$, where $\\bar{n}_i = n_i/g_i$ is the average occupation number per state at energy $\\epsilon_i$.\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy to Find the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nWe find the equilibrium distribution $\\{\\bar{n}_i\\}$ by maximizing the entropy $S$ subject to the constraint of fixed total mean energy $E = \\sum_i g_i \\bar{n}_i \\epsilon_i$. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we maximize the functional $L = S/k_B - \\beta(E - \\text{constant})$.\nThe maximization condition $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\bar{n}_i} = 0$ leads to:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}_i+1}{\\bar{n}_i}\\right) - \\beta\\epsilon_i = 0 \\implies 1 + \\frac{1}{\\bar{n}_i} = e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i}$\nThis gives the celebrated **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the equilibrium occupation number:\n$\\bar{n}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon} - 1}$\nThe Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified as the inverse temperature, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nTo find the total mean energy $E$, we must sum (integrate) the energy of all occupied states, weighted by the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$. For photons (relativistic spin-1 bosons) in a 3D box of volume $V$, including two polarization states, the density of states is:\n$g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\nThe total mean energy is:\n$E = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\bar{n}(\\epsilon) \\cdot g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} \\cdot \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n$E = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} d\\epsilon$\nBy substituting $x = \\beta\\epsilon$, the integral becomes a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1}dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n$E = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}\\right) = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V}{15(hc)^3} (k_B T)^4$\nThis is the famous **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe entropy can be calculated either by integrating the entropy density formula from Step 2, or more simply by using the thermodynamic relation for the Helmholtz Free Energy, $F = E - TS$. The free energy is given by $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$, where $Z$ is the partition function. For the photon gas:\n$\\ln Z = -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$\nIn the continuum limit, this becomes:\n$\\ln Z = -\\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})d\\epsilon = -\\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\nEvaluating this integral (e.g., via integration by parts) shows a direct relationship with the energy integral:\n$\\ln Z = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V}{45(hc)^3\\beta^3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{E}{k_B T}$\nFrom this, the free energy is $F = -k_B T \\ln Z = -E/3$.\nFinally, we find the equilibrium entropy:\n$S = \\frac{E - F}{T} = \\frac{E - (-E/3)}{T} = \\frac{4E}{3T}$\nSubstituting the expression for $E$:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} \\right) = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B}{45 (hc)^3} (k_B T)^3 = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are expressed in terms of the system's volume $V$, its temperature $T$, and fundamental physical constants (Boltzmann constant $k_B$, Planck's constant $h$, speed of light $c$).\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\n$E = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n$S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the energy as $S = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{E}{T}$.\n\n<<<Equilibrium Mean Energy: $E = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$>>>"
