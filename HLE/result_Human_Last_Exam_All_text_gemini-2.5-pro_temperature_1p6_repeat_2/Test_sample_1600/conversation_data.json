    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement**\n*   **`a(n)`:** This denotes a function or sequence where `n` is an integer index.\n*   **\"the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\"**: We need to count the number of topologically distinct Feynman diagrams that give a non-zero contribution to the physical quantity.\n*   **\"order 2n\"**: In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the \"order\" of a diagram typically refers to the power of the elementary charge `e` in the corresponding mathematical expression. Since the fine-structure constant `α` is proportional to `e^2`, an order of `2n` in `e` is often referred to as n-th order in `α`. The order `2n` corresponds to the number of vertices in the diagram, as each vertex represents a single interaction and contributes one power of `e`.\n*   **\"for the electron or the photon propagators\"**: This specifies the type of process. We are looking for diagrams that represent corrections to the propagation of a single particle (an electron or a photon) from one point to another. These are known as **self-energy diagrams**. They have two external lines.\n*   **\"in quantum electrodynamics (QED)\"**: This specifies the theory and its rules. QED vertices consist of two electron lines and one photon line.\n*   **\"what is a(3)?\"**: The question asks for the third term in this sequence, `a(3)`. Based on the definition, this means we need to find the number of diagrams of order 2 * 3 = 6. These are the diagrams with 6 vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the problem into graph theory terminology**\nThe question is asking for the number of connected, one-particle-irreducible (1PI) Feynman diagrams with two external lines (self-energy graphs) and 6 vertices in QED.\n*   **One-Particle-Irreducible (1PI):** A diagram is 1PI if it cannot be cut into two separate pieces by severing a single internal line. This is a standard way to organize and sum diagrams to avoid over-counting when calculating the full propagator.\n*   **Number of loops:** For self-energy diagrams in QED, a diagram with `2n` vertices has `n` loops. So for `n=3`, we are looking for diagrams with 3 loops.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate the first few terms of the sequence a(n)**\nThis is a well-known combinatorial problem in physics. Let's list the numbers for small values of `n`.\n\n*   **`a(1)` (Order 2, 1-loop):**\n    *   We need diagrams with 2 vertices.\n    *   There is only **one** such 1PI diagram. An electron emits a photon and then re-absorbs it.\n    *   So, **a(1) = 1**.\n\n*   **`a(2)` (Order 4, 2-loops):**\n    *   We need diagrams with 4 vertices.\n    *   There are **two** distinct 1PI diagrams.\n        1.  A \"nested\" diagram, where the 1-loop self-energy diagram is inserted into the internal electron line of another 1-loop self-energy diagram.\n        2.  A \"crossed\" or \"overlapping\" diagram, which has a different topology.\n    *   So, **a(2) = 2**.\n\n*   **`a(3)` (Order 6, 3-loops):**\n    *   We need diagrams with 6 vertices.\n    *   The task of drawing and classifying all possible distinct topologies becomes significantly more complex. This has been done by physicists using systematic methods.\n    *   The established result for the number of 3-loop 1PI self-energy diagrams in QED is **7**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the final answer**\nThe sequence `a(n)` for the number of QED 1PI self-energy diagrams of order `2n` begins:\n*   `a(1) = 1`\n*   `a(2) = 2`\n*   `a(3) = 7`\n*   `a(4) = 30`\n*   ...\n\nThe question asks for `a(3)`. Based on the established sequence, the value is 7.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Order vs. Loops:** It is crucial to correctly interpret \"order 2n\". In this context, it means 2n vertices. For self-energy diagrams, this corresponds to n loops. So, `a(3)` refers to 3-loop diagrams.\n2.  **1PI Condition:** The counting includes only one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams. This is standard because reducible diagrams are built from the 1PI ones.\n3.  **Electron vs. Photon:** The number of diagrams is the same for the electron self-energy and the photon self-energy (vacuum polarization) at any given loop order in QED.\n4.  **Non-Vanishing:** In QED, the topological enumeration generally corresponds to non-vanishing diagrams (Furry's theorem, which sets certain diagrams to zero, doesn't apply to these self-energy diagrams).\n5.  **Reliability of the Source:** This is not a number that can be easily derived from scratch. The answer relies on established results from the quantum field theory literature and combinatorial enumeration of graphs.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n1.  Identify the question is asking for `a(3)`.\n2.  Understand that `a(n)` is the number of diagrams of order `2n`.\n3.  For `n=3`, the order is `2*3 = 6`.\n4.  Recall or look up the known sequence for the number of QED 1PI self-energy diagrams for a given order (number of vertices).\n5.  The sequence for orders 2, 4, 6,... is 1, 2, 7,...\n6.  The term `a(3)` corresponds to order 6, which is the third number in the sequence.\n7.  The value is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
