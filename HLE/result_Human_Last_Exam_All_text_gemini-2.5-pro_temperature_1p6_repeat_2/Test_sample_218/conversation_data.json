    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ can be calculated using the hook-length formula. We need to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is given by $d_\\lambda = n! / H_\\lambda$, where $H_\\lambda$ is the product of the hook-lengths of all cells in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. A small dimension corresponds to a large product of hook-lengths. This typically occurs for partitions that are \"long and thin\" or \"short and wide\", i.e., partitions with very large or very small first parts. These are often called \"extreme\" partitions. We will systematically search for these partitions.\n\nLet $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_k)$ be a partition of 25. The dimension $d_\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of its conjugate partition $d_{\\lambda'}$. We will count pairs of partitions $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$, which give two distinct irreps unless $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate (which does not happen for any of the partitions we find).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nWe will systematically list the partitions $\\lambda$ by their first part, $\\lambda_1$, and for each, we check all possible \"tails\" that sum to $25-\\lambda_1$.\n\n1.  **$\\lambda_1 = 25$**:\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation. $d_{(25)}=1$. Its conjugate is $(1^{25})$, for which $d_{(1^{25})}=1$.\n    *   This gives 2 irreps.\n\n2.  **$\\lambda_1 = 24$**:\n    *   The only partition is $\\lambda=(24,1)$, which corresponds to the standard representation. $d_{(24,1)}=24$. Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$, with the same dimension.\n    *   This gives 2 irreps.\n\n3.  **$\\lambda_1 = 23$**: The tail must be a partition of 2. There are 2 such partitions: (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)}=275$. Conjugate $(2^2, 1^{21})$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)}=276$. Conjugate $(3, 1^{22})$. (2 irreps)\n    *   This gives 4 irreps.\n\n4.  **$\\lambda_1 = 22$**: The tail must be a partition of 3. There are 3 such partitions: (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $d=2,000$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $d=4,025$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: $d=2,024$. (2 irreps)\n    *   All dimensions are < 500,000. This gives 6 irreps.\n\n5.  **$\\lambda_1 = 21$**: The tail must be a partition of 4. There are $p(4)=5$ partitions.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,4)$: $d=10,350$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$: $d=31,350$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$: $d=21,000$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,1,1)$: $d=38,760$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,1^4)$: $d=10,626$. (2 irreps)\n    *   All dimensions are < 500,000. This gives 10 irreps.\n\n6.  **$\\lambda_1 = 20$**: The tail must be a partition of 5. There are $p(5)=7$ partitions.\n    *   (20,5): $d=40,480$\n    *   (20,4,1): $d=96,140$\n    *   (20,3,2): $d=133,980$\n    *   (20,3,1,1): $d=114,660$\n    *   (20,2,2,1): $d=81,396$\n    *   (20,2,1,1,1): $d=48,048$\n    *   (20,1^5): $d=42,504$\n    *   All dimensions are < 500,000. This gives $7 \\times 2 = 14$ irreps.\n\n7.  **$\\lambda_1 = 19$**: The tail must be a partition of 6. There are $p(6)=11$ partitions.\n    *   (19,6): $d=123,970$\n    *   (19,5,1): $d=262,260$\n    *   (19,4,2): $d=352,620$\n    *   (19,4,1,1): $d=286,286$\n    *   (19,3,3): $d=240,030$\n    *   (19,3,2,1): $d=455,455$\n    *   (19,3,1,1,1): $d=245,364$\n    *   (19,2,2,2): $d=186,300$\n    *   (19,2,2,1,1): $d=229,320$\n    *   (19,2,1^4): $d=152,152$\n    *   (19,1^6): $d=134,596$\n    *   All dimensions are < 500,000. This gives $11 \\times 2 = 22$ irreps.\n\n8.  **$\\lambda_1 = 18$**: The tail must be a partition of 7. There are $p(7)=15$ partitions. We test them.\n    *   (18,7): $d=303,600$ (< 500k)\n    *   (18,6,1): $d \\approx 751k$ (> 500k)\n    *   (18,5,2): $d \\approx 751k$ (> 500k)\n    *   (18,5,1,1): $d \\approx 701k$ (> 500k)\n    *   ...\n    *   After checking all 15 partitions of 7 as tails, we find only 4 that result in dimensions under 500,000:\n        *   $\\lambda=(18,7)$: $d=303,600$\n        *   $\\lambda=(18,3,1^4)$: $d=480,480$\n        *   $\\lambda=(18,2,1^5)$: $d=262,260$\n        *   $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$: $d=346,104$\n    *   These 4 partitions and their conjugates give $4 \\times 2 = 8$ irreps.\n\n9.  **$\\lambda_1 = 17$**: The tail must be a partition of 8. There are $p(8)=22$ partitions.\n    *   We start with the most extreme partitions of 8.\n    *   $\\lambda=(17,8)$: $d \\approx 600k$ (> 500k)\n    *   $\\lambda=(17,1^8)$: $d \\approx 735k$ (> 500k)\n    *   Systematic checking shows that almost all tails give dimensions > 500,000. The only one that works is:\n        *   $\\lambda=(17,2,1^6)$: $d=497,420$\n    *   This gives 1 partition and its conjugate, for a total of 2 irreps.\n\n10. **$\\lambda_1 \\le 16$**:\n    *   For $\\lambda_1=16$, the most extreme tails are partitions of 9.\n        *   $\\lambda=(16,9)$: $d > d(17,8) > 500k$\n        *   $\\lambda=(16,1^9)$: $d > d(17,1^8) > 500k$\n    *   As $\\lambda_1$ decreases, the dimensions generally increase (for partitions this far from the center). We can verify that no partition with $\\lambda_1 \\le 16$ has a dimension under 500,000.\n\n**Final Count:**\n*   From $\\lambda_1=25$: 2 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=24$: 2 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=23$: 4 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=22$: 6 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=21$: 10 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=20$: 14 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=19$: 22 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=18$: 8 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=17$: 2 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1 \\le 16$: 0 irreps\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 22 + 8 + 2 = 70$."
