    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the historically latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Key Paintings by Lady Butler and the Battles They Depict**\n\nFirst, we need to list some of Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler's, most famous military paintings and identify the historical event (battle or campaign) each one portrays.\n\n*   **\"The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras\"** (painted 1875)\n    *   **Battle:** Battle of Quatre Bras, part of the Napoleonic Wars.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** June 16, 1815.\n\n*   **\"Scotland Forever!\"** (painted 1881)\n    *   **Battle:** The charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, part of the Napoleonic Wars.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** June 18, 1815.\n\n*   **\"The Roll Call\"** (painted 1874)\n    *   **Battle:** The aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman, during the Crimean War.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** November 5, 1854.\n\n*   **\"Balaclava\"** (painted 1876)\n    *   **Battle:** The aftermath of the Charge of the Heavy Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, during the Crimean War.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** October 25, 1854.\n\n*   **\"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\"** (painted 1880)\n    *   **Battle:** The Battle of Rorke's Drift, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** January 22–23, 1879.\n\n*   **\"Floreat Etona!\"** (painted 1882)\n    *   **Battle:** An incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek, during the First Boer War.\n    *   **Date of Battle:** January 28, 1881.\n\n*   **\"The Camel Corps\"** (also known as \"The Desert March\") (painted 1885)\n    *   **Event:** The Gordon Relief Expedition, which included engagements like the Battle of Abu Klea during the Mahdist War in Sudan.\n    *   **Date of Event:** January 1885.\n\n*   **\"Within Sound of the Guns\"** (painted 1903)\n    *   **Event:** The Siege of Ladysmith during the Second Boer War.\n    *   **Date of Event:** November 1899 – February 1900.\n\n*   **\"In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\"** (painted 1915)\n    *   **Event:** The Great Retreat from Mons, a major British military operation at the start of World War I.\n    *   **Date of Event:** August 1914.\n\n**Step 2: List the Battle/Event Dates in Chronological Order**\n\nNow, we arrange the historical events depicted in her paintings by their date to find the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras: **1815**\n2.  Battle of Waterloo: **1815**\n3.  Battle of Balaclava: **1854**\n4.  Battle of Inkerman: **1854**\n5.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n6.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n7.  Gordon Relief Expedition: **1885**\n8.  Siege of Ladysmith: **1899–1900**\n9.  Retreat from Mons: **1914**\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Latest Historical Battle**\n\nComparing the dates, the latest historical event depicted in a known painting by Lady Butler is the **Retreat from Mons**, which took place in **1914** during World War I.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Date of Painting vs. Date of Battle:** The question asks for the latest *historical battle*, not the latest painting. Lady Butler often painted historical scenes many years after they occurred. For example, \"Scotland Forever!\" was painted in 1881, 66 years after the Battle of Waterloo (1815). The painting \"In the Retreat from Mons\" was created in 1915, just a year after the event it depicts.\n*   **Comprehensiveness:** It's important to consider a wide range of her work, not just her most famous Victorian-era paintings. While she is best known for depicting Napoleonic and colonial conflicts, her later work included subjects from the Second Boer War and World War I.\n*   **Definition of \"Battle\":** The Retreat from Mons was a military operation involving a series of rearguard actions and engagements rather than a single, static battle. However, it is a distinct and famous military event that fits the spirit of the question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe latest battle (or military event) depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Retreat from Mons** from World War I.\n\n<<<The Retreat from Mons>>>"
