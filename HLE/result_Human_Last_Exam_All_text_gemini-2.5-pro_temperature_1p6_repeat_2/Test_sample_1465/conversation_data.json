    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. The packing of these core residues dictates whether the helices assemble as dimers, trimers, tetramers, or higher-order oligomers. Interactions between the charged 'e' and 'g' positions can also influence stability and specificity.\n\nFirst, we must determine the correct heptad register for these sequences. A common convention for designed coiled-coils is to place large hydrophobic residues at 'a' and 'd', and charged residues at 'e' and 'g'. Let's test the possible registers. A register that begins with 'g' (`gabcdef`) is often a good starting point for sequences beginning with a charged residue like Glutamic acid (E).\n\n### Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`\n*   **Register Analysis**: Assuming the `gabcdef` register, the first heptad is `E(g)I(a)A(b)Q(c)A(d)L(e)K(f)`.\n*   **Core Residues**:\n    *   'a' positions: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n    *   'd' positions: A, A, W, A (Alanine, with one Tryptophan)\n*   **Oligomeric State Prediction**: The core motif is predominantly `I` at 'a' and `A` at 'd' (`IaAd`). This combination is a well-established motif for forming **trimers**. The small side chain of Alanine at 'd' packs efficiently against the Isoleucine at 'a' in a trimeric interface.\n*   **Conclusion**: State = **3 (Trimer)**.\n\n### Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`\n*   **Register Analysis**: Using the same `gabcdef` register, the repeating unit is `EIAALK(Q)`.\n*   **Core Residues**:\n    *   'a' positions: I, I, N, I (Isoleucine, with one Asparagine)\n    *   'd' positions: A, A, A, A (Alanine)\n*   **Oligomeric State Prediction**: The core is mostly `IaAd`, but with a critical substitution of Asparagine (N) at the third 'a' position (`Na`). A polar residue like Asn in the hydrophobic core is generally destabilizing, unless it can form specific hydrogen bonds. The Asn side chain is known to form a specific inter-helical hydrogen bond that strongly favors the formation of **dimers**.\n*   **Conclusion**: State = **2 (Dimer)**.\n\n### Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`\n*   **Register Analysis**: Let's check the heptad composition carefully. The repeat appears to be `EIAAIKQ`. Using the `gabcdef` register: `E(g)I(a)A(b)A(c)I(d)K(e)Q(f)`.\n*   **Core Residues**:\n    *   'a' positions: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n    *   'd' positions: I, I, W, I (Isoleucine, with one Tryptophan)\n*   **Oligomeric State Prediction**: The core motif is `I` at 'a' and `I` at 'd' (`IaId`). According to the rules established by Harbury and others, this core composition strongly directs the formation of **trimers**. Furthermore, this sequence has favorable `g-e'` salt bridges between Glutamic acid (`E` at `g`) and Lysine (`K` at `e`), which would further stabilize a parallel trimer.\n*   **Conclusion**: State = **3 (Trimer)**.\n\n### Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`\n*   **Register Analysis**: This sequence is different. The `gabcdef` register `(a=I, d=K)` places a charged Lysine (K) in the core, which is highly unfavorable. Let's test another register. If we start the heptad at the first `Q` (Glutamine), we get a `fgabcde` register: `E(f)I(g)Q(a)K(b)Q(c)L(d)K(e)`.\n*   **Core Residues**:\n    *   'a' positions: Q, Q, W, Q (Glutamine, with one Tryptophan)\n    *   'd' positions: L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n*   **Oligomeric State Prediction**: The core motif is `Q` at 'a' and `L` at 'd' (`QaLd`). Glutamine at a core position can form a network of hydrogen bonds. While Gln at 'a' can drive tetramerization, the presence of the relatively bulky Leucine at 'd' provides some steric hindrance. The combination of Gln at 'a' and a hydrophobic residue at 'd' is often found in **trimers**.\n*   **Conclusion**: State = **3 (Trimer)**.\n\n### Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`\n*   **Register Analysis**: This sequence is very similar to Sequence 1. The difference is a Threonine (T) instead of an Alanine (A) at the fourth position of each heptad. Using the `gabcdef` register, this puts `T` at the 'd' position.\n*   **Core Residues**:\n    *   'a' positions: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n    *   'd' positions: T, T, W, T (Threonine, with one Tryptophan)\n*   **Oligomeric State Prediction**: The core motif is `I` at 'a' and `T` at 'd' (`IaTd`). Both Isoleucine and Threonine are β-branched amino acids. Placing β-branched residues at both the 'a' and 'd' positions creates significant steric strain that cannot be well-accommodated in dimers or trimers. This steric clash is relieved in a **tetrameric** bundle, which has a larger and differently shaped hydrophobic core.\n*   **Conclusion**: State = **4 (Tetramer)**.\n\n### Final Summary:\n1.  Sequence 1: **Trimer (3)**\n2.  Sequence 2: **Dimer (2)**\n3.  Sequence 3: **Trimer (3)**\n4.  Sequence 4: **Trimer (3)**\n5.  Sequence 5: **Tetramer (4)**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of oligomeric states: **3, 2, 3, 3, 4**. This matches one of the provided answer choices.\n\n<<<E>>>"
