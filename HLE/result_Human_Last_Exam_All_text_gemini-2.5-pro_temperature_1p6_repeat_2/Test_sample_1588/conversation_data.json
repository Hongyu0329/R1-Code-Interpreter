    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n    The BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ in terms of a series of nested commutators of X and Y.\n    $Z = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}([X,[X,Y]] + [Y,[Y,X]]) + \\dots$\n    The formula can be written as a sum of homogeneous components of degree $n$:\n    $Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n    where $Z_n(X, Y)$ contains all terms of total degree $n$. For example, $Z_{10}(X,Y)$ is the component of order 10.\n\n2.  **Connection to Free Lie Algebras**\n    The terms in the BCH expansion are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, X and Y, denoted as $L(X,Y)$. The component of order $n$, $Z_n(X,Y)$, is specifically an element of the $n$-th graded subspace of this algebra, denoted $L_n(X,Y)$.\n\n3.  **Interpreting \"Number of Nonzero Coefficients\"**\n    The space $L_n(X,Y)$ is a vector space. We can choose a basis for this space consisting of specific nested commutators (for instance, a Hall basis or a Lyndon basis). The term $Z_n(X,Y)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis elements. A key result in the theory of Lie algebras is that for the BCH expansion, the coefficient of *every* basis element of $L_n(X,Y)$ is non-zero.\n    Therefore, the question \"What is the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10?\" is equivalent to asking \"What is the dimension of the vector space $L_{10}(X,Y)$?\".\n\n4.  **Using Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n    The dimension of the $n$-th graded component of a free Lie algebra with $k$ generators is given by Witt's formula:\n    $ \\text{dim}(L_n(k)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d} $\n    where:\n    *   $n$ is the order (degree).\n    *   $k$ is the number of generators.\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n    *   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n5.  **Applying Witt's Formula to the Problem**\n    For this specific problem:\n    *   The order is $n=10$.\n    *   The generators are $X$ and $Y$, so $k=2$.\n\n    We need to calculate $\\text{dim}(L_{10}(2))$.\n\n### Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Identify the divisors of n=10.**\nThe positive divisors of 10 are $d = \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the values of the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for these divisors.**\nThe Möbius function $\\mu(n)$ is defined as:\n*   $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n*   $\\mu(n) = (-1)^k$ if $n$ is a product of $k$ distinct primes.\n*   $\\mu(n) = 0$ if $n$ has any repeated prime factors.\n\nFor our divisors:\n*   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n*   $\\mu(2) = (-1)^1 = -1$ (since 2 is prime)\n*   $\\mu(5) = (-1)^1 = -1$ (since 5 is prime)\n*   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the values into Witt's formula.**\n$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d} $\n$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} \\right) $\n\n**Step 4: Perform the arithmetic.**\n$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right) $\n$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 1 \\cdot 1024 - 1 \\cdot 32 - 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2 \\right) $\n$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2) $\n$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} (988 + 2) $\n$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} (990) $\n$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}(2)) = 99 $\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe dimension of the space of commutators of order 10 is 99. As all basis elements for this space have non-zero coefficients in the BCH expansion, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
