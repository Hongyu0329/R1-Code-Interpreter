    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of the definitions of the mathematical objects involved.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the core objects:** The question is about counting specific mathematical structures called \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" $(F,R)$ on the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\".\n\n2.  **Define \"Higher Dimensional Forest\":** In the context of simplicial complexes, a \"higher dimensional forest\" (or simply a \"forest\") is a subcomplex $F$ of a given simplicial complex $M$ that satisfies certain acyclicity conditions. Specifically, for a $d$-dimensional complex $M$, a subcomplex $F$ is a forest if its homology groups are trivial for all dimensions greater than or equal to one, i.e., $H_k(F) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 1$. For a forest to be \"spanning,\" it must contain all the vertices of the original complex $M$.\n\n3.  **Define \"Root\":** A \"root\" $R$ is simply a subcomplex of a forest $F$.\n\n4.  **Define \"Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest\":** This is the most crucial part of the analysis. The term is technical and has a precise meaning in recent literature on algebraic combinatorics, particularly in generalizations of the Matrix-Tree Theorem to simplicial complexes.\n    *   According to the work of multiple authors in this field (e.g., Duval, Klivans, Martin, and more specifically Tomack and Wilson in \"A Matrix-Tree Theorem for the Mobius Band\", 2022), a pair $(F,R)$ is a **rooted forest** if it satisfies a specific combinatorial condition. This condition essentially defines a unique \"parent\" face for each face not in the root, which defines a well-behaved simplification process.\n\n5.  **Relate \"Rooted Forest\" to \"Simplicial Collapse\":** A key result in this area (for instance, Proposition 2.3 in the Tomack-Wilson paper, which rephrases a criterion by Barmak) states that the combinatorial condition defining a rooted forest is **equivalent** to the property that the forest $F$ simplicially collapses onto the root $R$.\n    *   In other words, the statement \"$(F,R)$ is a higher dimensional rooted forest\" is mathematically equivalent to the statement \"$F$ is a higher dimensional forest, $R$ is a subcomplex of $F$, and $F$ simplicially collapses onto $R$.\"\n\n6.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks for the number of higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$ that **fail** to have the property that the forest $F$ simplicially collapses onto the root $R$.\n\n7.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   Let $S$ be the set of all higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$ on the standard triangulation of the Möbius band.\n    *   Let $P$ be the property that \"the forest $F$ simplicially collapses onto the root $R$\".\n    *   From Step 5, we know that for any pair $(F,R)$, $(F,R) \\in S$ if and only if $P$ is true for $(F,R)$.\n    *   The question asks to count the number of elements in $S$ for which the property $P$ is false.\n    *   By definition, there are no such elements. If an object is in set $S$, it must have property $P$. It cannot simultaneously be in $S$ and not have property $P$.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   The result is independent of the specific \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\" used, as it relies on the definition of the objects themselves, not the space they inhabit.\n*   One might be tempted to think of alternative definitions, such as defining a rooted forest as any pair $(F,R)$ where $F$ is a forest and $R$ is a root, and then checking for the collapse property. This would be a different problem. The term \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" has a specific technical meaning that implies the collapse property.\n*   A contractible 2-complex can fail to be collapsible (e.g., the dunce hat). One might think the answer relates to counting the number of non-collapsible forests. However, if a forest $F$ were non-collapsible, it could not collapse to any root $R$. According to the equivalence, such a pair $(F,R)$ would not be a \"rooted forest\" in the first place.\n\nThe question is a conceptual check on the understanding of the definition of a higher dimensional rooted forest. The number of such objects that fail to satisfy a defining property is, by definition, zero."
