    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"What is the earliest known date...\"**: We are looking for a specific calendar date, not just general evidence of timekeeping.\n    *   **\"...recorded...\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or written on an artifact.\n    *   **\"...by a pre-Columbian civilization...\"**: The culture must be indigenous to the Americas and have created the record before significant European contact (c. 1492).\n    *   **\"...in the Americas...\"**: The artifact must originate from North, Central, or South America.\n    *   **\"...in the aboriginal writing system?\"**: The record must use a native script, such as Maya glyphs or Zapotec script, not just pictorial representations without a systematic calendrical meaning.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** The most advanced and earliest writing and calendar systems in the pre-Columbian Americas were developed in Mesoamerica. Key civilizations include:\n    *   **Olmec/Epi-Olmec:** Often considered the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica. Their successors, the Epi-Olmec, used an early version of the Long Count calendar.\n    *   **Zapotec:** Developed one of the earliest writing systems at their capital, Monte Albán.\n    *   **Maya:** Famous for their highly sophisticated writing and calendrical systems, including the Long Count and the 260-day sacred calendar.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates and Key Artifacts:**\n    *   **Zapotec Glyphs (Monte Albán):** Some of the earliest writing in Mesoamerica is Zapotec, with some glyphs on monuments dating to around 600 BC. While these include calendrical symbols, their interpretation as specific, absolute dates is debated and not as clearly understood as later systems. They typically represent a day in the 260-day cycle (e.g., \"1 Earthquake\") without a corresponding year, making it a recurring, not a unique, date.\n    *   **Long Count Dates (Epi-Olmec and early Maya):** The Long Count calendar is a system that counts the number of days from a mythical start date (August 11, 3114 BC in the most accepted correlation). This allows for the recording of unique, non-repeating dates over a 5,125-year cycle.\n        *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Epi-Olmec):** For a long time, this was the earliest known Long Count date. It records the date **7.16.6.16.18**, which corresponds to **September 3, 32 BC**.\n        *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Maya/Zoque influence):** Discovered later, this artifact from Chiapas, Mexico, has a Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**, which corresponds to **December 9, 36 BC**. This is currently the earliest known *Long Count* date, specifying a unique day and year.\n    *   **The San Bartolo Discovery (Maya):** This is the most recent and crucial piece of evidence. In 2022, archaeologists announced the discovery of painted wall fragments at the Maya site of San Bartolo in Guatemala.\n        *   **The Artifact:** The fragments contain a glyph for the date **\"7 Deer\"** (in the 260-day sacred calendar, or *tzolk'in*).\n        *   **The Age:** Crucially, associated organic material (charcoal) was radiocarbon-dated, placing the inscription itself between **300 and 200 BC**.\n\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"earliest known date recorded.\" This can be interpreted in two ways: the earliest historical date recorded (i.e., the oldest event), or the oldest physical recording of a date (i.e., the oldest artifact with a date on it).\n    *   The **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2** records the earliest unique historical date: **36 BC**.\n    *   However, the **San Bartolo fragment** is a much older artifact. It is the earliest *physical evidence* of a date being written down, dating to circa 250 BC. Although \"7 Deer\" is a date that repeats every 260 days, its inscription at San Bartolo is the oldest known instance of a pre-Columbian civilization recording a specific calendar day in a written script.\n    *   Therefore, the San Bartolo find represents the earliest known *act of recording* a date. It predates the Long Count inscriptions by over 200 years.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Absolute vs. Relative Date:** The Long Count provides an absolute date (a specific year), while the 260-day calendar provides a relative date (a specific day within a repeating cycle).\n*   **Age of Artifact vs. Date Recorded:** The San Bartolo fragment is an *artifact from 300-200 BC* showing a date (\"7 Deer\"). The Chiapa de Corzo Stela is an *artifact from ~36 BC* showing a date (*36 BC*). The San Bartolo record is physically much older.\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** The 2022 San Bartolo discovery is widely accepted and has superseded previous knowledge, establishing it as the earliest known example of calendrical writing in the Maya region, and indeed the Americas.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate answer is the \"7 Deer\" date from San Bartolo, as it is the oldest known physical record of a date.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is the day **\"7 Deer\"**. This date, part of the 260-day sacred calendar, was found on painted wall fragments at the Maya archaeological site of San Bartolo, Guatemala. Radiocarbon dating of associated materials dates the inscription to between **300 and 200 BC**, making it the oldest securely-dated example of a written date in the Americas.\n\n<<<The day \"7 Deer\", found on a painted fragment from the Maya site of San Bartolo, Guatemala, dated to between 300 and 200 BC.>>>"
