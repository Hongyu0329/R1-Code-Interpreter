    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_n$):** The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128. This group is denoted as $Q_{128}$ or $Q_{2^7}$ since $128 = 2^7$. The standard presentation of this group is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be generated by a single element of $G$. In other words, a power subgroup is simply a **cyclic subgroup**.\n*   **Goal:** The problem asks for the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n**2. Element Structure of $Q_{128}$**\n\nEvery element in $Q_{128}$ can be uniquely written in the form $x^k$ or $x^k y$, where $0 \\le k < 64$.\nThis naturally partitions the group into two disjoint sets of elements (besides the identity):\n*   Set A: Elements of the form $x^k$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 63\\}$. These form the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n*   Set B: Elements of the form $x^k y$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 63\\}$. There are 64 such elements.\n\nWe will count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each set.\n\n**3. Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements from Set A (powers of $x$)**\n\nThese are the cyclic subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle x \\rangle$, which has order 64.\nA fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $n$ has exactly one subgroup of order $d$ for each divisor $d$ of $n$.\nSo, the number of subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is equal to the number of divisors of 64.\n\nThe divisors of $64 = 2^6$ are:\n$2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64$.\nThere are $6+1=7$ divisors.\nTherefore, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**4. Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements from Set B (of the form $x^k y$)**\n\nFirst, let's determine the order of an element $g = x^k y$. We use the group relations ($yx^k = x^{-k}y$, which follows from $y^{-1}xy=x^{-1}$).\n$g^2 = (x^k y)(x^k y) = x^k (y x^k) y = x^k (x^{-k} y) y = x^k x^{-k} y^2 = y^2$.\nFrom the group presentation, $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\nThe order of $x^{32}$ is $|x^{32}| = \\frac{64}{\\text{gcd}(32, 64)} = \\frac{64}{32} = 2$.\nSince $g^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$, the order of $g$ is not 1 or 2.\nLet's compute $g^4$: $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\nSince $g^4 = 1$ and $g^2 \\neq 1$, the order of any element $g = x^k y$ must be 4.\n\nNow, we need to count how many *distinct* cyclic subgroups are generated by these 64 elements of order 4.\nLet $H_k = \\langle x^k y \\rangle$. Since $|x^k y| = 4$, $H_k$ is a cyclic group of order 4. Any cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators (where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function).\nThe generators of $H_k = \\langle g \\rangle$ are $g$ and $g^3$.\n$g = x^k y$\n$g^3 = g^2 \\cdot g = x^{32} (x^k y) = x^{32+k} y$.\nSo, the two generators of the subgroup $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$ are $x^k y$ and $x^{k+32} y$. This means:\n$\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^{k+32} y \\rangle$ (where the exponent addition is modulo 64).\n\nThe 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ are partitioned into pairs, $\\{x^k y, x^{k+32} y\\}$, where both elements in a pair generate the exact same subgroup. The number of distinct subgroups is the number of such pairs.\nNumber of distinct subgroups = (Total number of elements of this form) / (Number of generators per subgroup) = $64 / 2 = 32$.\nThus, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^k y$.\n\n**5. Total Count and Final Answer**\n\nWe have found two disjoint collections of cyclic subgroups:\n1.  The 7 cyclic subgroups contained entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  The 32 cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^k y$.\n\nThese two collections are disjoint because every subgroup in the second collection contains elements with a '$y$' component (e.g., $x^k y$), while every subgroup in the first collection consists solely of powers of $x$.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these two collections.\nTotal number = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Power Subgroup vs. Cyclic Subgroup:** It is essential to recognize that \"power subgroup\" is synonymous with \"cyclic subgroup\".\n*   **Group Structure:** Correctly using the relations of $Q_{128}$ is crucial, especially for calculating the order of elements like $x^k y$.\n*   **Counting Subgroups:** Distinguish between counting elements and counting the subgroups they generate. Multiple elements can generate the same subgroup.\n*   **Disjoint Sets:** Ensure that the counted sets of subgroups do not overlap to avoid double-counting.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups found.\n\n<<<39>>>"
