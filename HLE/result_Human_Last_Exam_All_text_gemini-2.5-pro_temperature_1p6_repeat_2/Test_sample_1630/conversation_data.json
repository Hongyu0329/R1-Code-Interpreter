    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the problem mathematically.**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\nSo, we want to find the maximum number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the equation.**\nLet's write $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\nLet's write $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\nThe composite function $f(g(x))$ is obtained by substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$. The term with the highest power of $x$ in $f(g(x))$ will be $a_3(g(x))^3$, which expands to $a_3(b_3x^3 + ...)^3 = a_3(b_3)^3x^9 + ...$.\nThe degree of the polynomial $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the constraints on the derivatives.**\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\nLet's find the derivatives:\n$f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$\n$g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$\nBoth $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are quadratic polynomials (parabolas). For a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, its graph must be a parabola opening upwards and lying entirely above the x-axis. This requires two conditions:\n1.  The leading coefficient must be positive: $A > 0$.\n2.  The discriminant must be negative (no real roots): $B^2 - 4AC < 0$.\n\nApplying these conditions to $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$:\n*   For $f'(x)$: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$. The discriminant $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n*   For $g'(x)$: $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$. The discriminant $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 - 12b_1b_3 < 0 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nThese conditions imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. The leading coefficients of both polynomials, $a_3$ and $b_3$, must be positive.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate if the maximum of 9 fixed points is achievable.**\nFor the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have at least 8 distinct real roots by Rolle's Theorem. Let's analyze $P'(x)$.\n$P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\nSo, we need to determine if the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1 = 0$ can have 8 distinct real roots.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the equation for the roots of P'(x).**\nLet $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$. We want to see if the equation $H(x) = 1$ can have 8 roots.\nLet's determine the degree of the polynomial $H(x)$:\n*   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\nThe degree of the composite polynomial $f'(g(x))$ is degree($f'$) $\\times$ degree($g$) = $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nThe degree of $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is degree($f'(g(x))$) + degree($g'(x)$) = $6 + 2 = 8$.\nSo, $H(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8.\n\nThe equation $H(x) = 1$ is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. Such an equation can have at most 8 real roots. This means that it is theoretically possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots.\n\n**Step 6: Argument for achievability.**\nTo achieve 9 fixed points, we need to show that we can choose the polynomials $f$ and $g$ (i.e., their coefficients) such that:\n1.  The derivative conditions ($f'>0, g'>0$) are met.\n2.  The equation $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ has 8 distinct real roots. Let these roots be $r_1 < r_2 < \\dots < r_8$. These are the critical points (locations of local extrema) of $P(x)$.\n3.  The values of $P(x)$ at these critical points alternate in sign, i.e., $P(r_1)>0$, $P(r_2)<0$, $P(r_3)>0$, and so on.\n\n*   **Can $H(x)=1$ have 8 roots?** $H(x)$ is a degree 8 polynomial. Its derivative, $H'(x)$, is a degree 7 polynomial, so it has at most 7 real roots. This means $H(x)$ has at most 7 local extrema (4 local minima and 3 local maxima, or vice versa). A graph of a degree 8 polynomial with 7 local extrema can intersect a horizontal line (like $y=1$) at most 8 times. It is possible to choose the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ to make the 4 local minima of $H(x)$ fall below 1 and the 3 local maxima fall above 1, resulting in 8 distinct real roots for $H(x)=1$. The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ are open inequalities on the coefficient space, meaning there is room to make such choices.\n\n*   **Can the values $P(r_i)$ be made to alternate in sign?** The polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x))-x$ has a degree of 9, and its leading coefficient $a_3(b_3)^3$ is positive. Thus, as $x \\to -\\infty$, $P(x) \\to -\\infty$, and as $x \\to \\infty$, $P(x) \\to \\infty$.\n    If we have 8 critical points $r_1, \\dots, r_8$, and we can make $P(r_1)>0$, $P(r_2)<0$, ..., $P(r_8)<0$, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem:\n    *   There is a root in $(-\\infty, r_1)$ since $P(x)$ goes from $-\\infty$ to a positive value.\n    *   There is a root in $(r_1, r_2)$ since $P(x)$ goes from positive to negative.\n    *   ...\n    *   There is a root in $(r_7, r_8)$.\n    *   There is a root in $(r_8, \\infty)$ since $P(x)$ goes from a negative value to $+\\infty$.\n    This would give a total of 9 roots.\n    The values of $P(r_i)$ can be adjusted by changing the constant terms $a_0$ and $b_0$ of the polynomials, which do not affect the derivatives $f'$ and $g'$. Specifically, changing $a_0$ shifts the entire graph of $P(x)$ vertically without changing the locations of its critical points, allowing us to position it to have 9 roots.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe maximum number of roots is bounded by the degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x))-x=0$, which is 9. The analysis of the derivatives shows that it is plausible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ satisfying the given conditions that achieve this maximum. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>>9"
