    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the final answer.\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of the integral for small $\\epsilon$.**\n    The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$, where $P(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$.\n    The parameter $\\epsilon$ is small and positive. The function $P(x)$ is zero at $x=0$ and positive for $x>0$. This means that as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)}$ develops a singularity at $x=0$. The dominant contribution to the integral will come from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the integrand for small x.**\n    For small $x$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is dominated by its term with the lowest power of $x$.\n    $P(x) \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\n    The main behavior of the integral is captured by approximating $P(x)$ with this leading term. The other terms, $5x^6$ and $9x^8$, can be treated as perturbations.\n\n3.  **Formulate an asymptotic expansion.**\n    The behavior near $x=0$ suggests an expansion in terms of $\\epsilon$. This is a classic singular perturbation problem that can be solved using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, or more directly by a change of variables that reveals the scaling. The dominant behavior is determined by the balance between $\\epsilon$ and the leading term $9x^5$. Let $9x^5 \\sim \\epsilon$. This suggests a change of variable $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} y$.\n    This scaling indicates that the integral will have an asymptotic series in fractional powers of $\\epsilon$, specifically in powers of $\\epsilon^{1/5}$. We seek the first few terms of this series:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx A_0 \\epsilon^{-4/5} + A_1 \\epsilon^{-3/5} + \\dots$\n\n4.  **Derive the leading term ($A_0 \\epsilon^{-4/5}$).**\n    This term arises from the leading approximation $P(x) \\approx 9x^5$.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$. We extend the integration limit to infinity because the singularity at $x=0$ makes the contribution from large $x$ negligible for the singular part.\n    Let $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} y$. Then $dx = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} dy$.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} dy}{\\epsilon + 9((\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} y)^5} = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} dy}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon y^5} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{\\epsilon \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dy}{1+y^5} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dy}{1+y^5}$.\n    The integral is a known value related to the Beta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dy}{1+y^p} = \\frac{\\pi/p}{\\sin(\\pi/p)}$. For $p=5$, this is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n    So, the leading term is $A_0 \\epsilon^{-4/5}$ with $A_0 = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n5.  **Derive the second term ($A_1 \\epsilon^{-3/5}$).**\n    The second term comes from the first correction to $P(x)$, which is $5x^6$.\n    We write $P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + O(x^8)$.\n    Let's substitute this into the integral using the same change of variables, $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} y$:\n    $\\epsilon + P(x) = \\epsilon + 9\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)y^5 + 5\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{6/5}y^6 + \\dots = \\epsilon(1+y^5) + 5\\frac{\\epsilon^{6/5}}{9^{6/5}}y^6 + \\dots$\n    The integrand becomes:\n    $\\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon(1+y^5) + 5\\frac{\\epsilon^{6/5}}{9^{6/5}}y^6 + \\dots} = \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon(1+y^5)}\\left(1 - \\frac{5\\epsilon^{1/5}y^6}{9^{6/5}(1+y^5)} + \\dots\\right)$\n    $= \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{9^{1/5}(1+y^5)} - \\frac{5 \\cdot \\epsilon^{-3/5}}{9^{7/5}} \\frac{y^6}{(1+y^5)^2} + \\dots$\n    Integrating this gives the asymptotic series for $I(\\epsilon)$. The coefficient $A_1$ is the integral of the second term's spatial part:\n    $A_1 = -\\frac{5}{9^{7/5}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{y^6}{(1+y^5)^2} dy$.\n    We calculate the integral using integration by parts: $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$, with $u=y^2$ and $dv = y^4/(1+y^5)^2 dy$. This gives $v = -1/(5(1+y^5))$.\n    $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{y^6}{(1+y^5)^2} dy = \\left[y^2 \\frac{-1}{5(1+y^5)}\\right]_0^\\infty - \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{-1}{5(1+y^5)}(2y)dy = 0 + \\frac{2}{5} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{y}{1+y^5} dy$.\n    The remaining integral is $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{y}{1+y^5} dy = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\n    So, $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{y^6}{(1+y^5)^2} dy = \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(2\\pi/5)} = \\frac{2\\pi}{25 \\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\n    Finally, $A_1 = -\\frac{5}{9^{7/5}} \\frac{2\\pi}{25 \\sin(2\\pi/5)} = -\\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)}$.\n\n6.  **Combine the terms to get the final analytical formula.**\n    The formula approximating $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ is the sum of the first two terms of the expansion.\n\nFinal analytical formula:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx A_0 \\epsilon^{-4/5} + A_1 \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\nwhere\n$A_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n$A_1 = -\\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot (9.0)^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)}$\nUsing the powers $-4/5 = -0.8$ and $-3/5 = -0.6$.\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-0.8} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot (9.0)^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-0.6}$\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-3/5}>>>"
