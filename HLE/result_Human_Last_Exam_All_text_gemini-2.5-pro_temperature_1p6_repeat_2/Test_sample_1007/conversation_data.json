    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position as it started.\n\n**Question:** Among the following classical ballet steps, which has the ending leg position the same as the starting position?\n\n**Analysis of Answer Choices:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** \"Entrechat\" is a jump where the legs beat against each other. \"Six\" refers to six movements (three openings and three closings). The sequence for an entrechat six starting with the right foot in front is:\n        1.  Jump up from fifth position.\n        2.  The back (left) leg beats behind the right.\n        3.  Legs open slightly.\n        4.  The front (right) leg beats behind the left.\n        5.  Legs open slightly.\n        6.  The original back (left) leg beats in front of the right before landing.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** A closed position, typically fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement Analysis:**\n        *   **Échappé:** A jump that \"escapes\" from a closed position to an open one (e.g., fifth to second position).\n        *   **Battu:** \"Beaten.\" The legs beat together as they leave the floor.\n        *   **Changé:** \"Changed.\" This explicitly indicates that the feet will change their front/back relationship. The step involves jumping from fifth to second, then jumping from second back to fifth, landing with the opposite foot in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The word \"changé\" confirms the positions are different.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one leg out, then jumps off the supporting leg to bring both legs together (\"assemble\") in the air before landing on both feet simultaneously in fifth position.\n        *   **Assemblé dessus (over):** If starting with the right foot front, the left (back) foot would brush out and then land in *front* in fifth position. This changes the feet.\n        *   **Assemblé dessous (under):** If starting with the right foot front, the left (back) foot would brush out and land in the *back* in fifth position. This does *not* change the feet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** \"Assemblé\" is a category of steps. While some versions (like assemblé dessous) do not change the feet, others (like the common assemblé dessus) do. This makes the answer ambiguous without further specification. However, compared to other options, there is a possibility.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide.\" \"Derrière\" means \"behind.\"\n        1.  From fifth with the right foot front, the dancer glides the *back* foot (left foot) out to the side.\n        2.  They push off the right foot and, for a brief moment, both feet are in the air.\n        3.  They land on the left foot and then close the right foot *behind* the left into fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** A \"gargouillade\" is a decorative jump. It is often described as a pas de chat with a rond de jambe (circular movement) of each leg.\n        1.  From fifth with the right foot front, the dancer jumps.\n        2.  The back leg (left) is brought up and performs a small rond de jambe en dehors (outward circle).\n        3.  The front leg (right) is then quickly brought up and performs a small rond de jambe en dedans (inward circle).\n        4.  The dancer lands on the first leg (left) and immediately closes the second leg (right) back to its starting place in the front of fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the same foot in front (right foot front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard execution of a gargouillade begins and ends in the same position.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nComparing all the options, `Entrechat six`, `Échappé battu changé`, and `Glissade derrière` definitively change the foot position. `Assemblé` can be performed without changing feet (`dessous`), but the common variant (`dessus`) does change them. `Gargouillade`, in its standard form, is specifically a step that returns to the original starting position. Therefore, `Gargouillade` is the most accurate and reliable answer.\n\n<<<E>>>"
