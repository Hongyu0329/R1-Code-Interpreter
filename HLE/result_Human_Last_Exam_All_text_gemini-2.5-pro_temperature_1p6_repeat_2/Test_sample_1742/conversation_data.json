    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\nThe algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of type $A_3$.\n\nThe category of finitely generated left $A$-modules, mod-$A$, can be described by representations of $Q$. The indecomposable $A$-modules are well-known and correspond to intervals $[i,j]$ where $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. Let $M(i,j)$ denote the indecomposable module with support on the vertices $\\{k \\mid i \\le k \\le j\\}$. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ such modules:\n1.  $S_1 = M(1,1): \\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0$. This is the simple module at vertex 1 and is also the injective module $I_1$.\n2.  $S_2 = M(2,2): 0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. This is the simple module at vertex 2.\n3.  $S_3 = M(3,3): 0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$. This is the simple module at vertex 3 and also the projective module $P_3$.\n4.  $M(1,2): \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. This is the injective module $I_2$.\n5.  $P_2 = M(2,3): 0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$. This is the projective module at vertex 2.\n6.  $P_1 = M(1,3): \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$. This is the projective module at vertex 1 and also the injective module $I_3$.\n\nThe indecomposable projective modules are $P_1=M(1,3)$, $P_2=M(2,3)$, $P_3=M(3,3)$.\nThe indecomposable injective modules are $I_1=M(1,1)$, $I_2=M(1,2)$, $I_3=M(1,3)$.\n\n### Step 2: Define $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules\n\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting module**: For a hereditary algebra like $A$, the concepts of a **tilting module** and a **$\\tau$-tilting module** coincide. A module $T$ is a tilting module if:\n    1.  The projective dimension of $T$ is at most 1 (which is always true for any module over a hereditary algebra).\n    2.  $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T, T) = 0$.\n    3.  $T$ is the direct sum of $n$ non-isomorphic indecomposable modules, where $n$ is the number of simple modules (here $n=3$).\n\n*   **Slice module**: While there are several related definitions of a slice, a common one in this context is a tilting module $T = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n M_i$ where the indecomposable summands $M_i$ are pairwise **Hom-orthogonal**, i.e., for any distinct summands $M_i, M_j$ of $T$, $\\text{Hom}_A(M_i, M_j) = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Tilting Modules that are not Slice Modules\n\nWe need to find tilting modules that do not satisfy the Hom-orthogonality condition for slice modules. There are two canonical candidates for tilting modules over any basic algebra: the algebra itself (as a direct sum of its indecomposable projectives) and its dual (as a direct sum of indecomposable injectives).\n\n1.  **The Regular Module $A$**: Let $T_P = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$.\n    *   **Is it a tilting module?** Yes. Since all summands are projective, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(P_i, X) = 0$ for any module $X$. Therefore, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_P, T_P) = 0$. It also has 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. So, $T_P = A$ is a tilting module.\n    *   **Is it a slice module?** Let's check for Hom-orthogonality. There is a non-zero homomorphism (an inclusion) from $P_2 = M(2,3)$ to $P_1 = M(1,3)$. Since $\\text{Hom}_A(P_2, P_1) \\neq 0$, the summands are not pairwise Hom-orthogonal. Thus, $T_P = A$ is **not** a slice module.\n\n2.  **The Injective Cogenerator Module $DA$**: Let $T_I = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$.\n    *   **Is it a tilting module?** Yes. Since all summands are injective, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(X, I_j) = 0$ for any module $X$. Therefore, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_I, T_I) = 0$. It also has 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. So, $T_I = DA$ is a tilting module.\n    *   **Is it a slice module?** Let's check for Hom-orthogonality. There is a non-zero homomorphism (a projection) from $I_2 = M(1,2)$ to $I_1 = M(1,1)$. Since $\\text{Hom}_A(I_2, I_1) \\neq 0$, the summands are not pairwise Hom-orthogonal. Thus, $T_I = DA$ is **not** a slice module.\n\nA theorem by Happel and Ringel states that for a tame hereditary algebra (which includes type $A_n$), a tilting module is a slice module if and only if it is neither preprojective nor preinjective. The modules $A$ and $DA$ are the archetypal preprojective and preinjective tilting modules, respectively. All other tilting modules for this algebra are slice modules.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the \"Unique\" Module\n\nWe have found two $\\tau$-tilting modules, $A$ and $DA$, that are not slice modules. The question asks for the \"unique\" such module. This implies there is a canonical way to distinguish between $A$ and $DA$.\n\n*   The module $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ is the algebra itself, viewed as a right module over itself. It is the fundamental object of study, the generator of the module category, and satisfies $A \\cong \\text{End}_A(A)$.\n*   In the modern theory of support $\\tau$-tilting modules (by Adachi, Iyama, and Reiten), modules are generalized to pairs $(M, P)$ where $M$ is a module and $P$ is a projective module. The set of support $\\tau$-tilting modules forms a poset. In this framework, the module $A$ corresponds to the pair $(0, A)$, which is the **unique minimum element** in this poset.\n*   The module $DA = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$, the injective cogenerator, corresponds to the pair $(DA, 0)$ and is a maximal element in the poset, but not necessarily the unique one.\n\nThe unique status of $A$ as the most fundamental tilting module and as the minimum element in the poset of support $\\tau$-tilting modules is the property that singles it out. Therefore, it is the intended answer.\n\nThe module is $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = M(1,3) \\oplus M(2,3) \\oplus M(3,3)$.\nIts representation is the direct sum of:\n*   $P_1: \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$\n*   $P_2: 0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$\n*   $P_3: 0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$\n\n<<<P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3>>>"
