    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**1. Analyze the User's Question**\n\n*   **Objective:** Compute the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix.\n*   **Matrix:**\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   **Contextual Information:** The question identifies the matrix as \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". While this information gives context to where the matrix comes from (a field of theoretical physics/mathematics), the matrix `A` is explicitly provided. Therefore, the calculation of the determinant relies only on the given numerical entries of `A`, not on the understanding of Markov quivers or the parameter \\( m_{1/2} \\).\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Focus on the Core Task:** The problem is a straightforward determinant calculation. The contextual information should not complicate the approach.\n*   **Choose a Method:** There are several methods to compute a 3x3 determinant:\n    1.  Cofactor Expansion (the general formula)\n    2.  Sarrus's Rule (a shortcut for 3x3 matrices)\n    3.  Using Row/Column Properties (the most efficient method if applicable)\n*   **Sign Convention:** Be extremely careful with negative signs during multiplication and addition/subtraction, which is a common source of error in determinant calculations.\n*   **Verification:** If possible, use more than one method to verify the result.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation**\n\nWe will compute the determinant using three different methods to ensure the result is correct.\n\n**Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix using cofactor expansion along the first row is:\n\\( \\det(A) = a_{11} \\cdot C_{11} + a_{12} \\cdot C_{12} + a_{13} \\cdot C_{13} \\)\nwhere \\( C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij} \\), and \\( M_{ij} \\) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row `i` and column `j`.\n\nFor our matrix \\( A \\):\n\\( a_{11} = 2, a_{12} = -1, a_{13} = -1 \\)\n\n*   **Step 1:** Calculate the determinant of the minor matrices.\n    *   \\( M_{11} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n    *   \\( M_{12} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n    *   \\( M_{13} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 3 \\)\n\n*   **Step 2:** Combine the terms using the cofactor expansion formula.\n    \\( \\det(A) = (2) \\cdot \\det(M_{11}) - (-1) \\cdot \\det(M_{12}) + (-1) \\cdot \\det(M_{13}) \\)\n    \\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (3) \\)\n    \\( \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\)\n    \\( \\det(A) = 0 \\)\n\n**Method 2: Sarrus's Rule**\n\nThis rule is a mnemonic for 3x3 determinants. We write out the first two columns again to the right of the matrix and sum the products of the diagonals.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\begin{matrix}\n2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & -1\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\n\n*   **Step 1:** Sum the products of the forward (top-left to bottom-right) diagonals:\n    \\( (2)(2)(2) + (-1)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(-1) = 8 - 1 - 1 = 6 \\)\n\n*   **Step 2:** Sum the products of the backward (top-right to bottom-left) diagonals:\n    \\( (-1)(2)(-1) + (2)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(-1) = 2 + 2 + (-1) = 3 \\)\n    Whoops, let's re-check the diagonals for Sarrus's rule.\n    *   Backward diagonals:\n        *   \\( (-1)(2)(-1) = 2 \\)\n        *   \\( (2)(-1)(-1) = 2 \\)\n        *   \\( (-1)(-1)(-1) = -1 \\) This isn't a diagonal in Sarrus' rule. Let's list them properly.\n        *   Anti-diagonal 1: \\( (-1) \\times 2 \\times (-1) = 2 \\)\n        *   Anti-diagonal 2: \\( (2) \\times (-1) \\times (-1) = 2 \\)\n        *   Anti-diagonal 3: \\( (-1) \\times (-1) \\times 2 = 2 \\)\n    *   Sum of backward diagonal products: \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\)\n\n*   **Step 3:** Subtract the sum of the backward diagonals from the sum of the forward diagonals.\n    \\( \\det(A) = (\\text{Sum of forward}) - (\\text{Sum of backward}) \\)\n    \\( \\det(A) = 6 - 6 \\)\n    \\( \\det(A) = 0 \\)\n\n**Method 3: Using Row/Column Properties**\n\nA key property of determinants is that if the rows or columns of a matrix are linearly dependent, the determinant is zero. Linear dependence can often be spotted by a simple relationship between rows or columns.\n\n*   **Step 1:** Let \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) be the column vectors of the matrix.\n    \\( C_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, C_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\n*   **Step 2:** Check if there is a simple linear combination of the columns that results in the zero vector. Let's try adding them together.\n    \\( C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - 1 - 1 \\\\ -1 + 2 - 1 \\\\ -1 - 1 + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\n*   **Step 3:** Since we found a non-trivial linear combination of the columns that equals the zero vector (\\(1 \\cdot C_1 + 1 \\cdot C_2 + 1 \\cdot C_3 = \\mathbf{0}\\)), the columns are linearly dependent.\n\n*   **Step 4:** A matrix with linearly dependent columns (or rows) is singular, which means its determinant is 0.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nAll three methods consistently show that the determinant of the matrix A is 0. The most elegant method is the third one, which quickly identifies the linear dependence of the columns.\n\nThe final answer is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
