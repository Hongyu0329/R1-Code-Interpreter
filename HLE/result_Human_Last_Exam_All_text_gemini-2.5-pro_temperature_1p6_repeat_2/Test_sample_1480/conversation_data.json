    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" in the context of an interval type-3 fuzzy set (IT3FS). We are given two numerical values and told that a t-norm operation is involved.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Rule Activation Level\"**\nIn any fuzzy inference system (Type-1, Type-2, or Type-3), a rule has the structure \"IF [antecedent] THEN [consequent]\".\n*   **Antecedent:** The \"IF\" part of the rule (e.g., \"IF temperature is HIGH AND humidity is LOW\").\n*   **Consequent:** The \"THEN\" part of the rule (e.g., \"THEN fan speed is FAST\").\nThe **rule activation level**, also known as the firing strength or firing level, is a value (or a fuzzy set in higher-order systems) that represents the degree to which the antecedent is satisfied by a given set of inputs. This calculation is the first step in determining a rule's contribution to the final output and it relies *only* on the input values and the antecedent part of the rule.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Given Information**\nWe are given three pieces of information:\n1.  `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`: In the notation of fuzzy systems, `Φ_k(x′)` (or `w_k`) typically represents the final firing strength (i.e., the activation level) of the `k`-th rule for a given input `x'`.\n2.  `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: The notation `G_k` represents the fuzzy set in the **consequent** (the \"THEN\" part) of the `k`-th rule. Therefore, `μG_k_j(y_j)` is a membership grade related to the rule's *output*, not its activation.\n3.  `using a t-norm operation`: A t-norm (like minimum or product) is a mathematical operator used to calculate the logical \"AND\". In fuzzy logic, it's used to combine the membership grades from multiple clauses in the antecedent (e.g., for \"temperature is HIGH **AND** humidity is LOW,\" the t-norm would combine the grade for \"temperature is HIGH\" with the grade for \"humidity is LOW\").\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Relevance of Information:** The core of the problem is to identify which information is relevant. The rule activation level depends only on the antecedent. The value `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` belongs to the consequent and is used in a later step (implication) to determine the rule's output. Therefore, it is irrelevant for calculating the activation level.\n\n2.  **Role of the T-norm:** The t-norm is used to compute the overall antecedent satisfaction from its constituent parts. The symbol `Φ_k(x′)` represents the result of this computation. Since the value of `Φ_k(x′)` is already given as `0.7`, we do not need to perform any new t-norm calculation. The mention of a t-norm is contextual, explaining how the value `0.7` was likely obtained.\n\n3.  **Inconsistency with Type-3 Theory:** In a strict Interval Type-3 Fuzzy System, the rule activation `Φ_k(x′)` would be an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set, not a single number like `0.7`. The question presents a highly simplified scenario, effectively treating the activation level as a crisp number (as in a Type-1 fuzzy system). We must work within this simplification.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question asks for the \"rule activation level\".\n2.  By definition, the rule activation level is the firing strength of the rule's antecedent.\n3.  The problem provides this value directly: `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n4.  The other information (`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` and the use of a t-norm) is extraneous to the question asked, as it pertains to other stages of the fuzzy inference process or to a calculation whose result is already provided.\n5.  Therefore, the rule activation level is the given value for the antecedent's firing strength.\n\n**Final Answer:** The rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
