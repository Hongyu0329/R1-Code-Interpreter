    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the problem and definitions**\n\nWe are asked to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\n*   A polynomial matrix `G(s)` is a **right divisor** of `P(s)` if there exists a polynomial matrix `Q(s)` such that `P(s) = Q(s)G(s)`.\n*   `G(s)` is a **common right divisor** of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if it is a right divisor of both.\n*   `G(s)` is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** if it is a common right divisor, and for any other common right divisor `D(s)`, `D(s)` is a right divisor of `G(s)`. This means `G(s) = L(s)D(s)` for some polynomial matrix `L(s)`.\n*   A GCRD is unique up to a pre-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant). A common choice for a GCRD, when matrices are coprime, is the identity matrix `I`.\n\n**2. Method 1: The Euclidean Algorithm (via column operations)**\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD of `P1` and `P2` is to form the composite matrix `M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]` and reduce the `P2(s)` block to zero using elementary column operations. The resulting matrix in the top block will be a GCRD.\n\n`M(s) = [s^2 + s, -s;`\n`         -s^2 - 1, s^2;`\n`         s,       0;`\n`         -s - 1,  1]`\n\nLet C1 and C2 be the columns of `M(s)`. We can use the '1' in position (4,2) to simplify the first column.\n\n*   **Operation 1:** C1 -> C1 + (s+1) * C2\n    *   The new first column `C1_new` becomes:\n        `[ (s^2+s) - s(s+1); (-s^2-1) + s^2(s+1); s + 0; (-s-1) + 1(s+1) ]`\n        `= [ 0; s^3-1; s; 0 ]`\n\n*   The transformed matrix `M'(s)` is:\n    `M'(s) = [0,       -s;`\n    `         s^3-1,   s^2;`\n    `         s,       0;`\n    `         0,       1 ]`\n\nThe lower block, representing the transformed `P2`, is now `P2' = [s, 0; 0, 1]`.\nThe algorithm requires us to continue until the lower block is the zero matrix. However, at this stage, we cannot use column operations to eliminate the `s` in position (3,1) or the `1` in position (4,2) because the corresponding entries in the other column are zero. This makes the algorithm difficult to proceed with manually.\n\n**3. Method 2: Rank Test for Coprimeness**\n\nA fundamental property relates the GCRD to the rank of the composite matrix `M(s)`.\n*   `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` are **right coprime** if and only if their GCRD is a unimodular matrix (e.g., the identity matrix `I`).\n*   `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` are right coprime if and only if the composite matrix `M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]` has full column rank for all complex values of `s`.\n\nLet's check the rank of `M(s)`. `M(s)` is a 4x2 matrix, so its rank can be at most 2. The rank drops below 2 if and only if the two columns are linearly dependent for some `s`. This happens if and only if all 2x2 minors of `M(s)` are zero for that value of `s`.\n\nLet's compute the determinants of all six 2x2 submatrices (minors) of `M(s)`:\n\n1.  Rows 1, 2: `det(P1) = (s^2+s)(s^2) - (-s)(-s^2-1) = s^4+s^3 - (s^3+s) = s^4-s = s(s^3-1)`\n2.  Rows 1, 3: `det([s^2+s, -s; s, 0]) = 0 - (-s)(s) = s^2`\n3.  Rows 1, 4: `det([s^2+s, -s; -s-1, 1]) = (s^2+s) - (-s)(-s-1) = s^2+s - (s^2+s) = 0`\n4.  Rows 2, 3: `det([-s^2-1, s^2; s, 0]) = 0 - (s^2)(s) = -s^3`\n5.  Rows 2, 4: `det([-s^2-1, s^2; -s-1, 1]) = (-s^2-1) - s^2(-s-1) = -s^2-1 + s^3+s^2 = s^3-1`\n6.  Rows 3, 4: `det(P2) = s*1 - 0*(-s-1) = s`\n\nThe set of all 2x2 minors is `{s(s^3-1), s^2, 0, -s^3, s^3-1, s}`.\n\nThe rank of `M(s)` is less than 2 if and only if all of these minors are simultaneously zero. Let's see if there is any `s` for which this happens.\nFor the minors to be all zero, we need `s=0` (from the last minor) and `s^3-1=0` (from the fifth minor).\n*   If `s=0`, the fifth minor `s^3-1` becomes `0^3-1 = -1`, which is not zero.\n*   If `s^3-1=0`, then `s` is a cube root of unity, and the last minor `s` is not zero.\n\nSince there is no value of `s` for which all 2x2 minors are zero, the rank of the matrix `M(s)` is always 2 for all complex `s`.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nSince the matrix `[P1(s); P2(s)]` has full column rank for all `s`, the polynomial matrices `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` are **right coprime**.\n\nBy definition, the greatest common right divisor of two right coprime matrices is any unimodular matrix. The most common and simplest choice for a unimodular GCRD is the identity matrix.\n\nFinal Answer: The GCRD is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n`G(s) = [1, 0; 0, 1]`"
