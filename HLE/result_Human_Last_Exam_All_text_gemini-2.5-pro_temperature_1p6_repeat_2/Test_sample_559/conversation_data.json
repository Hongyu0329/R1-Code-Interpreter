    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**1. The System of Equations**\nThe given system is:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nLet's rewrite the equations as:\n$$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^3(u-1)$$\n$$u' = u^2(u-1)$$\nWe are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Finding Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d + 0 = 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    So, we have an equilibrium point at $(u,d) = (0,0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2-3(1))d + 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 0$.\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, we have two equilibrium points at $(u,d) = (1,0)$ and $(u,d) = (1,-1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**3. Stability Analysis of Equilibrium Points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix of the system for the state vector $(u,d)^T$.\n$J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3-3u^2 & 4d+5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   **At (0,0):** $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate point.\n\n*   **At (1,0):** $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(0) + 4(1)^3-3(1)^2 & 4(0)+5(1)^2-3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1,0)$ is an **unstable node (source)**.\n\n*   **At (1,-1):** $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) + 4(1)^3-3(1)^2 & 4(-1)+5(1)^2-3(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7+1 & -4-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since they are real and have opposite signs, $(1,-1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n**4. Finding the Separatrix**\nSeparatrices are special trajectories that divide the phase plane into regions of different long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices. We have a saddle point at $(1,-1)$.\n\nLet's find the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. This manifold consists of two trajectories that leave the saddle point as $t$ increases. Let's look for a simple analytical curve that could be a trajectory.\nConsider a curve of the form $d=f(u)$. For this to be a trajectory, it must satisfy the equation $\\frac{d}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\nLet's test if the curve $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory (an invariant manifold). For this to be true, if we take a point $(u,d)$ on the curve, its velocity vector $(u', d')$ must be tangent to the curve.\nAn easier way is to substitute $d(t) = -[u(t)]^2$ into the system of equations.\nThe derivative with respect to time is $d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t)$.\nUsing the equation for $u'$, we get:\n$d'(t) = -2u \\cdot (u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the $d'$ equation:\n$2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^3(u-1) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n$= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nSince the two expressions for $d'$ are identical, the curve $d=-u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold, meaning it is a union of trajectories.\n\nLet's check if this curve passes through any of our equilibrium points.\n*   If $u=0$, then $d=-(0)^2=0$. It passes through $(0,0)$.\n*   If $u=1$, then $d=-(1)^2=-1$. It passes through $(1,-1)$.\n\nSo, the parabola $d=-u^2$ is a trajectory that connects the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and the degenerate point $(0,0)$. Such a connecting orbit is known as a heteroclinic orbit.\n\nThe unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ is tangent to the eigenvector corresponding to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$. The eigenvector $v_1$ for $J(1,-1)$ is:\n$(J-I)v = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$.\nThe eigenvector can be chosen as $(1,-2)^T$. The slope of the unstable manifold at $(1,-1)$ is thus $dv/du = -2/1 = -2$.\n\nLet's check the slope of our found curve $d=-u^2$ at $u=1$.\n$\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2(1)=-2$.\nSince the curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and its tangent matches the direction of the unstable manifold, this curve is a branch of the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\nUnstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices. Thus, $d=-u^2$ is a separatrix of the system."
