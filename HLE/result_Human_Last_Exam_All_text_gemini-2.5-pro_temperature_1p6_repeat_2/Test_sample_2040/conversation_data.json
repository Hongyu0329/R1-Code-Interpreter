    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   **Definition:** SPDC is a nonlinear optical process. In this process, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear material and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The energy is conserved, meaning the energy of the pump photon equals the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons ($E_{pump} = E_{signal} + E_{idler}$).\n*   **Key Material Requirement:** The most crucial requirement for SPDC to occur is that the material must possess a significant **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility**, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two). This coefficient quantifies the material's ability to produce a nonlinear polarization response that is quadratic in the applied electric field.\n\n**2. Analyze the Role of Material Symmetry**\n\n*   **Fundamental Principle:** In the field of nonlinear optics, there is a strict selection rule based on the crystal symmetry of the material.\n*   **Inversion Symmetry:** The second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$, is a third-rank tensor. For materials that possess a **center of inversion** (i.e., are **centrosymmetric**), the value of $\\chi^{(2)}$ is identically zero in the bulk electric dipole approximation.\n*   **Implication:** This means that second-order nonlinear effects, including SPDC and the more commonly known second-harmonic generation (SHG), are forbidden in materials with inversion symmetry. A material must be **non-centrosymmetric** to exhibit SPDC.\n\n**3. Examine the Material: Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\n*   **Structure:** Boron nanosheets, or borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) single-atom-thick sheets of boron. They can exist in several different atomic arrangements, known as polymorphs. The most common and stable synthesized phases are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases.\n*   **Symmetry of Borophene:** Both the $\\beta_{12}$ phase (space group *Pmmn*) and the $\\chi_3$ phase (space group *Cmmm*) of ideal, flat borophene possess a **center of inversion**. They are, therefore, **centrosymmetric** structures.\n\n**4. Combine the Analysis to Reach a Conclusion**\n\n1.  SPDC requires a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  Materials with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric materials) have a $\\chi^{(2)}$ value of zero.\n3.  Ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, based on the fundamental properties of the material's crystal structure, boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** The analysis above applies to an ideal, pristine, and perfectly flat boron nanosheet. In reality, several factors could break the inversion symmetry locally:\n    *   **Edges and Defects:** The edges of the nanosheet and any point or line defects within the crystal lattice break the perfect symmetry.\n    *   **Strain and Ripples:** Mechanical strain or out-of-plane buckling (ripples), which are common in 2D materials, can break the global inversion symmetry.\n    *   **Substrate Interaction:** The question specifies \"free-standing,\" which eliminates this. However, if the nanosheet were placed on a substrate, the interaction could break the symmetry.\n    *   **External Fields:** A strong external DC electric field could also be used to artificially break the inversion symmetry, but this is an external influence, not an intrinsic property.\n\n2.  **Magnitude of Effect:** Even if symmetry is broken by defects or strain, the resulting $\\chi^{(2)}$ would be very small. The SPDC efficiency would likely be negligible and not considered a characteristic feature of the material, unlike in conventionally used non-centrosymmetric crystals like BBO ($\\beta$-BaB$_2$O$_4$) or KDP (KH$_2$PO$_4$).\n\n3.  **Higher-Order Processes:** While second-order effects are forbidden, centrosymmetric materials like borophene can (and do) possess a non-zero **third-order nonlinear susceptibility**, $\\chi^{(3)}$. This allows for different nonlinear processes like third-harmonic generation (THG) and spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), which also produces photon pairs but from two pump photons instead of one.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on its intrinsic centrosymmetric crystal structure, a free-standing boron nanosheet is fundamentally forbidden from exhibiting spontaneous parametric downconversion. While minor effects might be induced by imperfections, it is not an expected or characteristic property of the material.\n\n<<<No, because the common crystalline structures of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, which forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like spontaneous parametric downconversion.>>>"
