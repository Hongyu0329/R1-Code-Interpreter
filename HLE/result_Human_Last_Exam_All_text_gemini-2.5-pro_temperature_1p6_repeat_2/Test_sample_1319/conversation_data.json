    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.**\nThe first task is to create a comprehensive list of all real-world mountains that are explicitly named in Homer's epic poem.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods and the most prominent mountain in the epic. It is the highest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida:** Mentioned frequently, this is the mountain near Troy from which Zeus often observes the battle. This is the Mount Ida in modern-day Turkey (Kaz Dağı), not the Mount Ida on Crete.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the island of Samothrace to watch the Trojan War. This mountain is now known as Mount Fengari or Saos.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, Hera's journey from Olympus to Ida takes her over the \"snowy mountains of the horse-breeding Thracians\" and specifically \"from Athos she passed over the surging sea.\"\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, Greece, this mountain is mentioned as the source of the ash wood for Achilles' great spear.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as the homeland of the Maeonians, who fought for Troy. This is a real mountain range in ancient Lydia (modern Turkey).\n\n**Step 2: Apply the constraints from the question.**\nThe question asks to exclude Mount Olympus from the list. Our remaining candidates are:\n*   Mount Ida (Turkey)\n*   Mount Samothrace (Fengari/Saos)\n*   Mount Athos\n*   Mount Pelion\n*   Mount Tmolus\n\n**Step 3: Determine the modern elevations of the candidate mountains.**\nTo find the tallest, we need to compare their actual physical heights.\n\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** The highest peak is 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Fengari, Greece):** The peak is 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n*   **Mount Athos (Greece):** The peak is 2,033 meters (6,670 feet).\n*   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** The highest peak is 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağlar, Turkey):** The highest peak is 2,157 meters (7,077 feet).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the elevations and identify the tallest.**\nNow we rank the mountains from the list by their height:\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,157 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\nThe tallest mountain on this list is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Two Mount Idas:** It is crucial to distinguish between Mount Ida near Troy (mentioned in the *Iliad*) and the taller Mount Ida on Crete (central to Zeus's origin myths but not a location in the *Iliad*'s narrative).\n2.  **Historical vs. Mythical:** All the mountains listed are real, historical locations, fitting the question's criteria.\n3.  **Prominence vs. Height:** While Mount Ida and Mount Samothrace play more significant narrative roles as divine vantage points, the question asks for the *tallest* mountain, a purely geographical metric, not the most important.\n4.  **Inclusion of Tmolus:** Mount Tmolus is mentioned only briefly in the Catalogue of Ships, making it easy to overlook. However, its explicit mention makes it a valid candidate, and its superior height makes it the correct answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter compiling a list of all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, excluding Mount Olympus, and comparing their modern elevations, the tallest is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
