No, homopolynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.

While both are biological polymers and homopolynucleotides do contain a sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) in each of their repeating units, their fundamental structures are entirely different. Here is a breakdown of the key structural differences:

1.  **Different Monomers (Repeating Units):** The monomer of a polysaccharide is a simple sugar (a monosaccharide). The monomer of a homopolynucleotide is a nucleotide, which is a much more complex unit composed of three parts: a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
2.  **Different Backbone Structure:** In a polysaccharide, the backbone of the polymer is formed by a chain of sugar units linked directly to each other. In a polynucleotide, the backbone is a repeating sequence of alternating sugar and phosphate groups. The nitrogenous bases are attached to the sugar units and are considered side groups to this backbone.
3.  **Different Chemical Bonds:** The bonds that link the monomers are fundamentally different. Polysaccharides use **glycosidic bonds** to link sugar units together. Polynucleotides use **phosphodiester bonds** to link a nucleotide's sugar to the next nucleotide's phosphate group.

In conclusion, polysaccharides belong to the class of macromolecules known as carbohydrates, while polynucleotides are nucleic acids. They are not structurally the same.
