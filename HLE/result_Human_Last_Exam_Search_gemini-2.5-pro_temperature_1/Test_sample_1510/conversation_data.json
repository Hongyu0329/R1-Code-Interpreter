    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional, repetitive pattern. There are 17 such groups in total. The point group of a wallpaper pattern consists of the symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed, with the order of the group being the total number of these operations.\n\nFor a point group to have an order of 2, it must contain two symmetry operations: the identity operation and one other. In the context of two-dimensional crystallography, there are two such point groups:\n\n*   **C₂:** This group contains the identity and a 180° rotation.\n*   **D₁:** This group contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that correspond to these point groups are:\n\n1.  **p2:** This group's symmetries consist of translations and 180° rotations. Its point group is C₂.\n2.  **pm:** This group has translations and reflections, with all reflection axes parallel to one another. It has no rotations. Its point group is D₁.\n3.  **pg:** This group's symmetries are translations and glide reflections. When considering the point group, the translation component of the glide reflection is ignored, leaving a simple reflection. Therefore, its point group is D₁.\n4.  **cm:** This group also has reflections and a centered lattice but no rotations. Its point group is D₁.\n\nOther wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders. For example, the point group for `p1` has an order of 1, while the point groups for `pmm` and `pgg` have an order of 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
