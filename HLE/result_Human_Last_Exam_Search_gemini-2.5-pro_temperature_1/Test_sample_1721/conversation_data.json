    "The problem asks for the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A\\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A|= (c+o(1))N$, for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1+a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no square numbers.\n\nWe can establish a lower bound for $c$ by constructing such a set $A$. Consider the set $A$ of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\nThe size of this set is approximately $N/3$, so $|A| = (1/3 + o(1))N$.\n\nLet's examine the sumset $A+A$. For any two elements $x, y \\in A$, their sum is:\n$x + y \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\nNow, let's consider the possible values of a perfect square modulo 3. Any integer $k$ can be written as $3m$, $3m+1$, or $3m+2$.\n- If $k = 3m$, then $k^2 = (3m)^2 = 9m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n- If $k = 3m+1$, then $k^2 = (3m+1)^2 = 9m^2 + 6m + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n- If $k = 3m+2$, then $k^2 = (3m+2)^2 = 9m^2 + 12m + 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n\nSo, any perfect square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3. Since every element in the sumset $A+A$ is congruent to 2 modulo 3, no element of $A+A$ can be a perfect square. This construction shows that there exists a set $A$ with density $1/3$ such that $A+A$ contains no squares. Therefore, $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nA result by Jason Lucier in his 2006 PhD thesis, \"Sets whose sumset contains no squares,\" states that if a set $A$ of positive integers has a positive upper density and its sumset $A+A$ contains no squares, then $A$ must be contained within a single residue class modulo 3.\n\nLet's analyze the three possible cases:\n1.  $A \\subseteq \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$: The sumset $A+A$ is a subset of $\\{n \\mid n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$. This set of numbers contains squares, for example, $9, 36, 81$. It is not guaranteed that $A+A$ will be square-free. For instance, if $A = \\{3, 6, 12, 15, \\dots \\}$, then $3+6=9$ is a square in $A+A$.\n2.  $A \\subseteq \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$: As shown in our construction, the sumset $A+A$ is a subset of $\\{n \\mid n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$. This set contains no squares. The maximum density of such a set $A$ is $1/3$, achieved by taking all numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n3.  $A \\subseteq \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$: The sumset $A+A$ is a subset of $\\{n \\mid n \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. This set contains squares, for instance, $4, 25, 49$. For example, if $2 \\in A$, then $2+2=4$ is a square in $A+A$.\n\nBased on this analysis, for $A+A$ to be free of squares, the set $A$ must be a subset of $\\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. Therefore, the density of $A$ cannot exceed $1/3$. This establishes an upper bound, $c \\le 1/3$.\n\nCombining the lower bound from our construction and the upper bound from Lucier's result, we conclude that the largest possible value for $c$ is $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
