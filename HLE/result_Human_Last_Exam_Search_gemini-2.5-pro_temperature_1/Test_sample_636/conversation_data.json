    "To calculate the state feedback gain matrix F such that the closed-loop system `A + BF` has specified eigenvalues, we can use the method of pole placement.\n\n### 1. Problem Definition\n\nWe are given the system matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find a 2x2 feedback matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n### 2. Desired Characteristic Polynomial\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair. The characteristic polynomial corresponding to these eigenvalues is:\n`p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`p(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`p(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n### 3. Pole Placement for a Multi-Input System\n\nFor a multi-input system, the feedback gain matrix `F` that achieves a desired set of eigenvalues is generally not unique. This provides extra freedom, which can be used to satisfy other design criteria, such as optimizing eigenvector directions. A common method to find a solution is to simplify the problem by converting the multi-input system into a single-input system.\n\nThis can be done by restricting the control input `u` to a specific direction, for example, by setting `F` to have a specific structure where some rows are zero. Let's assume a structure for `F` as:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Feedback Gain\n\nWith this simplified `F`, the product `BF` becomes:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] = [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, we form the closed-loop matrix `A + BF`:\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system is `det(sI - (A + BF))`.\n`det([[s - (-1 + f1), -(1 + f2)], [-(1 + f1), s - f2]]) = 0`\n`(s + 1 - f1)(s - f2) - (1 + f2)(1 + f1) = 0`\n`s^2 - s*f2 + s - f2 - s*f1 + f1*f2 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2) = 0`\n`s^2 + s(1 - f1 - f2) - f2 + f1*f2 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2 = 0`\n`s^2 + s(1 - f1 - f2) + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2) = 0`\n\nBy equating the coefficients of this polynomial with the desired characteristic polynomial `s^2 + 2s + 2`, we get a system of two linear equations:\n1.  `1 - f1 - f2 = 2`  => `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 = 2` => `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n\nSolving this system:\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n`(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstituting `f2 = -2` into the first equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nThus, the elements of the feedback matrix `F` are `f1 = 1` and `f2 = -2`.\n\n### 5. Resulting Feedback Gain Matrix\n\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n### 6. Verification\n\nTo verify the solution, we can compute the eigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop system `A + BF`.\n`A + BF = [[-1 + 1, 1 - 2], [1 + 1, 0 - 2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\n\nThe characteristic equation is `det(sI - (A+BF)) = 0`:\n`det([[s, 1], [-2, s + 2]]) = s(s + 2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`\nThe roots of this equation are `s = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)) / 2 = -1 ± j`.\nThe eigenvalues match the desired locations.\n\n<<<F = [[1, -2],]>>>"
