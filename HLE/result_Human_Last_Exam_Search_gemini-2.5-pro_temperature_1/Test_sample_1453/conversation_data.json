    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern and analyze the residues at the core positions according to the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The `a` and `d` positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues, which form the core of the coiled-coil structure. The residues at positions `e` and `g` are often charged and form salt bridges that stabilize the structure.\n\nLet's analyze the provided sequence to find this repeating pattern. A common strategy is to look for a repeating sequence of hydrophobic and polar amino acids. The hydrophobic residues in the sequence are I, A, L, and W.\n\nIf we assign the heptad positions as follows, a consistent and chemically sensible pattern emerges:\n\n**Sequence:** G E I **A** Q S **L** K E I **A** K S **L** K E I **A** W S **L** K E I **A** Q S **L** K G\n**Heptad:**   . . . **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e .\n\nLet's examine the residues at each position of the four complete heptad repeats:\n*   **Position `a` (Knob):** Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Alanine (A), Alanine (A)\n*   **Position `b`:** Glutamine (Q), Lysine (K), Tryptophan (W), Glutamine (Q)\n*   **Position `c`:** Serine (S), Serine (S), Serine (S), Serine (S)\n*   **Position `d` (Knob):** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n*   **Position `e`:** Lysine (K), Lysine (K), Lysine (K), Lysine (K)\n*   **Position `f`:** Glutamic acid (E), Glutamic acid (E), Glutamic acid (E), Glutamic acid (E)\n*   **Position `g`:** Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n\nThis registration places the small hydrophobic residue Alanine consistently at the `a` position and the larger hydrophobic residue Leucine consistently at the `d` position. This creates a hydrophobic seam critical for the coiled-coil interaction. The charged residues Lysine (K) and Glutamic acid (E) are at the `e` and `f` positions, respectively, where they can form stabilizing salt bridges.\n\n### 2. Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is largely determined by the identity and packing efficiency of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` core positions. Research has established general rules based on these residues:\n*   **Dimer:** Favored by Isoleucine at position `a` and Leucine at position `d`. The archetypal GCN4 leucine zipper, a dimer, follows this pattern.\n*   **Trimer:** Favored by a more even distribution of Isoleucine at both the `a` and `d` positions.\n*   **Tetramer:** Favored by the reverse of the dimer pattern, with Leucine at position `a` and Isoleucine at position `d`.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Sequence\n\nIn the given sequence, the core positions are occupied by **Alanine (A) at `a`** and **Leucine (L) at `d`**.\n\n*   The presence of Leucine at every `d` position is a defining feature of a \"leucine zipper,\" a motif strongly associated with forming dimers.\n*   Alanine is a small, non-bulky hydrophobic residue. Its presence at the `a` position allows for efficient and tight packing in a dimeric structure without the steric hindrance that bulkier residues might introduce, which can sometimes favor higher-order oligomers.\n*   The `a=A, d=L` pattern is a common variation of the canonical `a=I, d=L` dimeric motif. The packing of Alanine from one helix into the \"hole\" created by the Leucine-containing face of the partner helix is geometrically favorable for a two-stranded (dimeric) coiled-coil.\n\nBased on the consistent presence of Alanine at the `a` position and Leucine at the `d` position, which closely resembles the well-characterized dimeric leucine zipper motif, the protein would most likely adopt a dimeric state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
