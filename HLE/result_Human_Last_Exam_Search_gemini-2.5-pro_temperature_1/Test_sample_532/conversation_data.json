    "A finite group G is called a filled group if all its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fill G. A product-free set S is a non-empty subset of G such that the equation `ab=c` has no solution in S. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A maximal by inclusion product-free set S is said to fill G if every non-identity element of G is in the union of S and the set of products SS = {ab | a, b ∈ S}.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups can be determined by considering the structure of nilpotent groups and key results from the study of filled groups. A finite nilpotent group is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, which are groups of prime-power order. This means the study of filled nilpotent groups can be reduced to the study of filled p-groups.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is as follows:\n\nA finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the following:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, denoted C_3.\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted C_5.\n*   A filled 2-group.\n\nThis is based on a crucial result which states that any filled nilpotent group must be of odd order (and thus C_3 or C_5) or a 2-group.\n\n### Filled Abelian Nilpotent Groups\nFor the case of abelian (and therefore nilpotent) groups, the classification was established by Street and Whitehead. A finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is one of the following:\n*   C_3\n*   C_5\n*   An elementary abelian 2-group, which is a group of the form (C_2)^n for some integer n ≥ 1.\n\n### Filled Non-Abelian Nilpotent Groups\nSince filled nilpotent groups must be C_3, C_5, or a 2-group, any non-abelian filled nilpotent group must be a 2-group. Research by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, among others, has led to the classification of these groups. A conjecture by these authors lists all known finite filled groups. The non-abelian nilpotent groups from this list are:\n*   The dihedral group of order 8, D_8.\n*   The direct product D_8 × C_2.\n*   The central product of D_8 and the quaternion group Q_8, denoted D_8 * Q_8.\n*   The direct product (D_8 * Q_8) × C_2.\n\nIt is important to note that generalized quaternion groups are not filled.\n\nIn summary, the finite filled nilpotent groups are the cyclic groups C_3 and C_5, the elementary abelian 2-groups, and the four non-abelian 2-groups listed above.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic groups C_3 or C_5, an elementary abelian 2-group, the dihedral group D_8, D_8 × C_2, the central product D_8 * Q_8, or (D_8 * Q_8) × C_2.>>>"
