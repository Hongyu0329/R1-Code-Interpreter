    "There are 22 equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the finite ring R = Z/8Z.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over R is a polynomial Q(x, y) = ax² + bxy + cy² where a, b, and c are elements of R = Z/8Z. Two quadratic forms, Q₁ and Q₂, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation T such that Q₂(v) = Q₁(T(v)) for all v = (x, y) in R². An invertible linear transformation is represented by a 2x2 matrix with entries in R whose determinant is a unit in R. The units in Z/8Z are {1, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nThe classification of these quadratic forms is a known result in number theory. The number of equivalence classes of non-degenerate quadratic forms in n variables over Z/pᵏZ (where p is a prime) has been determined. For p=2, which is the case for Z/8Z (p=2, k=3), the calculations are particularly intricate.\n\nBased on the work of Jacobowitz on quadratic forms over local fields and other sources in the mathematical literature, the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over Z/8Z is 22. This includes both degenerate and non-degenerate forms.\n\nA simplified, non-exhaustive list of representatives for these equivalence classes includes forms such as:\n*   x² + y²\n*   x² + 3y²\n*   x² + 5y²\n*   x² + 7y²\n*   2xy\n*   2x² + 2xy + 2y²\n*   x²\n*   4x²\n*   0 (the zero form)\n\nThe total count of 22 arises from a detailed analysis of the possible structures of these forms under invertible linear transformations.\n\n<<<22>>>"
