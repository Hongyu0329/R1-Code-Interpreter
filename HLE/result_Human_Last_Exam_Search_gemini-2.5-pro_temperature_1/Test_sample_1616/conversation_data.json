    "Trisyllabic laxing is a rule in English phonology where a tense vowel (like the \"i\" in *divine*) becomes a lax vowel (like the \"i\" in *divinity*) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third from the end) of a word.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the provided words:\n*   **derivative**: This word is derived from \"derive,\" which has a tense vowel /aɪ/. In \"derivative,\" this vowel becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the third-to-last syllable, which is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: This word comes from \"serene,\" which has a tense vowel /iː/. In \"serenity,\" the vowel in the corresponding syllable becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/. This is another clear case of the rule.\n*   **gratitude**: This word is related to \"grateful,\" which has a tense vowel /eɪ/. In \"gratitude,\" the vowel becomes lax, /æ/. This also follows the pattern.\n*   **southern**: This word is disyllabic (having two syllables) in Modern English. However, it historically had three syllables (Old English *sūðerne*). The long vowel was shortened due to its position before the final two syllables, an older form of trisyllabic laxing that occurred in Middle English.\n*   **pleasant**: While this word shows vowel laxing when compared to its root \"please\" (the tense /iː/ becomes the lax /ɛ/), it is a two-syllable word. This type of change in a disyllabic word is typically referred to as disyllabic laxing or shortening, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This word comes from the Old English *sceadwe* and does not show the kind of vowel alternation seen in the other examples. It is a disyllabic word and has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing because they are not three-syllable words. However, \"pleasant\" does show a similar, though distinct, vowel laxing process from its root \"please.\" \"Shadow\" does not derive from a root word in Modern English in a way that would trigger this kind of vowel laxing. Therefore, \"shadow\" is the clearest example of a word on the list that has not been affected by this phonological process in its development.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
