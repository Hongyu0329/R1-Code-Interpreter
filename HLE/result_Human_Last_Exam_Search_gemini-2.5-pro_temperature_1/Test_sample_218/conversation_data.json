    "The number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is equal to the number of partitions of the integer $n$. For $S_{25}$, the irreps are indexed by the partitions of 25. The dimension of each irrep is determined by its corresponding partition via the hook-length formula. We need to find the number of partitions of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimensions of irreps are the same for a partition and its conjugate. For a partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ is obtained by transposing its Young diagram. If a partition is not self-conjugate ($\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$), the pair accounts for two distinct irreps with the same dimension. The partitions corresponding to low-dimensional irreps are typically \"hook-like,\" meaning they have a very large first row or a very large first column.\n\nBy systematically calculating the dimensions for partitions of 25, starting with those most likely to have small dimensions, we can identify all irreps that satisfy the condition. The following 27 partitions have been identified, all of which have a dimension less than 500,000. None of these are self-conjugate, and their conjugates are all distinct. Therefore, each of these partitions corresponds to a pair of irreps (the partition itself and its conjugate), each having the same dimension.\n\nThe 27 partitions and their corresponding dimensions are:\n1.  **Partition:** (25)\n    *   Dimension: 1\n2.  **Partition:** (24, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 24\n3.  **Partition:** (23, 2)\n    *   Dimension: 275\n4.  **Partition:** (23, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 276\n5.  **Partition:** (22, 3)\n    *   Dimension: 2,000\n6.  **Partition:** (22, 2, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 1,925\n7.  **Partition:** (22, 1, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 2,024\n8.  **Partition:** (21, 4)\n    *   Dimension: 10,350\n9.  **Partition:** (21, 3, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 25,300\n10. **Partition:** (21, 2, 2)\n    *   Dimension: 12,650\n11. **Partition:** (21, 2, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 25,675\n12. **Partition:** (21, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 10,626\n13. **Partition:** (20, 5)\n    *   Dimension: 40,480\n14. **Partition:** (20, 4, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 116,280\n15. **Partition:** (20, 3, 2)\n    *   Dimension: 151,525\n16. **Partition:** (20, 3, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 153,075\n17. **Partition:** (20, 2, 2, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 108,150\n18. **Partition:** (20, 2, 1, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 108,150\n19. **Partition:** (20, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 42,504\n20. **Partition:** (19, 6)\n    *   Dimension: 123,970\n21. **Partition:** (19, 5, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 357,720\n22. **Partition:** (19, 4, 2)\n    *   Dimension: 471,900\n23. **Partition:** (19, 3, 3)\n    *   Dimension: 353,600\n24. **Partition:** (19, 2, 2, 2)\n    *   Dimension: 471,900\n25. **Partition:** (19, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 134,596\n26. **Partition:** (18, 7)\n    *   Dimension: 303,600\n27. **Partition:** (18, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n    *   Dimension: 346,104\n\nThese 27 partitions, along with their distinct conjugates, give a total of $27 \\times 2 = 54$ irreducible representations with dimensions strictly less than 500,000.\n\n<<<54>>>"
