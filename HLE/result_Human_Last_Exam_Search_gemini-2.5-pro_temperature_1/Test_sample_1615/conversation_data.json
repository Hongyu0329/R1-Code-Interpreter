    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n = 12345$ vertices. The chromatic number of a graph, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, with the condition that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nA complete graph $K_n$ is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. The chromatic number of a complete graph $K_n$ is $n$. In this case, for $K_{12345}$, the chromatic number would be 12345.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the graph $G$ is not the complete graph. This means that there is at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge.\n\nWe can establish an upper bound for the chromatic number of such a graph. Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring. For the remaining $12345 - 2 = 12343$ vertices, we can, in the worst-case scenario, assign each a unique color different from the color of $u$ and $v$. This leads to a coloring using $1 + 12343 = 12344$ colors. This demonstrates that any graph on $n$ vertices which is not complete can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors. For a graph with 12345 vertices, this means the chromatic number can be no more than 12344.\n\nTo show that this maximum is achievable, we need to provide an example of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete but requires 12344 colors.\n\nConsider one of the following graphs:\n1.  **A complete graph minus one edge ($K_{12345}-e$)**: Start with the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and remove a single edge between two vertices, say $u$ and $v$. This graph is not complete. To color it, we can assign $u$ and $v$ the same color. The other 12343 vertices are all adjacent to each other (forming a $K_{12343}$) and also to both $u$ and $v$. Therefore, each of these 12343 vertices needs a unique color that is different from the color used for $u$ and $v$. This requires $12343$ additional colors, for a total of $1 + 12343 = 12344$ colors. Thus, $\\chi(K_{12345}-e) = 12344$.\n2.  **The disjoint union of $K_{12344}$ and an isolated vertex ($K_{12344} \\cup K_1$)**: This graph consists of two disconnected components. One is a complete graph with 12344 vertices, and the other is a single vertex with no edges. The total number of vertices is $12344 + 1 = 12345$. The graph is not complete because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices. The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components. The chromatic number of $K_{12344}$ is 12344, and the chromatic number of $K_1$ is 1. Therefore, the chromatic number of the entire graph is $\\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have shown that no such graph can have a chromatic number greater than 12344, and we have provided an example of a graph that requires 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nThis result is also related to Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most its maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the case of $K_{12345}-e$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta = 12344$, and the chromatic number is 12344, which is consistent with the theorem.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
