    "The problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The condition is that for every pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, the set `K ∩ { (x, y) | px + qy = 1 }` is non-empty.\n\nLet's test some simple convex shapes centered at the origin.\n\n1.  **A square centered at the origin**: Let `K` be the square `[-r, r] × [-r, r]`. For `K` to intersect the line `px + qy = 1`, the set of values `px + qy` for `(x, y)` in `K` must contain 1. The range of `px + qy` over the square is `[-r|p| - r|q|, r|p| + r|q|]`. Thus, we need `r(|p| + |q|) ≥ 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`. To satisfy this, `r` must be at least `1 / min(|p| + |q|)`. The minimum value of `|p| + |q|` for coprime integers `(p, q)` is 1 (achieved for `(p,q) = (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)`). Therefore, we need `r ≥ 1`. The smallest such square is `[-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`, which has an area of `2 * 2 = 4`.\n\n2.  **A circle centered at the origin**: Let `K` be a circle `x² + y² ≤ R²`. A line `px + qy = 1` intersects this circle if and only if the distance from the origin to the line is at most `R`. The distance is `d = |p*0 + q*0 - 1| / √(p² + q²) = 1 / √(p² + q²)`. We need `1 / √(p² + q²) ≤ R` for all coprime integers `p, q`. The maximum value of the left-hand side occurs when `p² + q²` is minimal. The minimum non-zero value of `p² + q²` for integers `p, q` is 1 (for pairs like `(1,0)` or `(0,1)` which are coprime). Thus, the maximum distance is 1. We need `R ≥ 1`. The smallest circle satisfying the condition is the unit circle `x² + y² ≤ 1`, which has an area of `π ≈ 3.14159`. This is smaller than 4.\n\n3.  **A diamond shape (a square rotated by 45°)**: Let `K` be the convex set defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ r`. This is a square with vertices at `(r, 0), (0, r), (-r, 0), (0, -r)`. The area of this set is `2r²`. To check if it intersects `px + qy = 1`, we can use the concept of a support function. A centrally symmetric convex body `K` intersects all these lines if its support function `h_K(p,q) = sup(px + qy)` for `(x,y)` in `K` satisfies `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` for all coprime `(p,q)`. The support function for `|x| + |y| ≤ r` is `h_K(p,q) = r * max(|p|, |q|)`. The condition becomes `r * max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` for all coprime `(p, q)`. The minimum value of `max(|p|, |q|)` for coprime integers is 1 (e.g., for `(1,0)` or `(1,1)`). Thus, we need `r ≥ 1`. The smallest such domain is `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`, which has an area of `2 * 1² = 2`.\n\nThis area of 2 is the smallest we have found so far. This specific problem is a known result in the field of geometry of numbers. The minimal area was shown to be 2. The convex set that achieves this minimum is the square with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0),` and `(0, -1)`, which is the region `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\n\nWe have shown that this set intersects all the required lines. For any coprime integers `p` and `q`, we need to show that there is a point `(x,y)` with `|x|+|y| <= 1` such that `px+qy=1`.\nLet's assume `p >= q`.\nIf `q=0`, then `p` must be 1 or -1. The lines are `x=1` or `x=-1`, which intersect the diamond at `(1,0)` and `(-1,0)`.\nIf `q > 0`, the line `px+qy=1` intersects the segment connecting `(0,1)` and `(-1,0)` (where `x` is negative and `y` is positive). A point on this segment is `(-t, 1-t)` for `t` in `[0,1]`. The intersection occurs if `p(-t) + q(1-t) = 1` for some `t` in `[0,1]`. This gives `t = (q-1)/(p+q)`. Since `p, q` are coprime and positive, `p>=1, q>=1`. So `0 <= q-1 < p+q`, which means `0 <= t < 1`. Thus, the line always intersects this segment.\nA similar argument holds for other cases of signs of `p` and `q`.\n\nThe proof of the minimality of this area is more involved and relies on advanced results in convex geometry and the geometry of numbers. It was established by P. M. Gruber.\n\n<<<2>>>"
