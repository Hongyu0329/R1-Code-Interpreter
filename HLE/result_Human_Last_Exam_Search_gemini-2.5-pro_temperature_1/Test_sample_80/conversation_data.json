    "To determine how many edge squares would lack bishops, we first need to find the total number of edge squares and then subtract the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them.\n\nFirst, a standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge squares are those on the first and eighth rows, and the 'a' and 'h' files. The number of squares on each of the first and eighth rows is 8. The number of remaining squares on the 'a' and 'h' files is 6 each. Therefore, the total number of edge squares is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28. Alternatively, one can subtract the inner 6x6 grid of squares from the total: 64 - 36 = 28 edge squares.\n\nNext, we must find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these 28 squares without any bishop attacking another. Bishops move along diagonals and always remain on squares of the same color. The 28 edge squares are evenly divided into 14 light-colored squares and 14 dark-colored squares. Since bishops on light squares cannot attack bishops on dark squares, we can solve the problem for each color independently and then sum the results.\n\nFor each set of 14 same-colored squares, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops is 7. This can be determined by analyzing the diagonals that connect these squares. For both the light and dark squares on the edge, the squares can be grouped into four distinct diagonal paths: three paths containing four squares each and one path containing two squares. To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, one can place at most two bishops on a four-square path and one on a two-square path. This gives a total of 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 bishops for each color.\n\nTherefore, the total maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 7 (on light squares) + 7 (on dark squares) = 14. A similar problem on a full n x n board allows for a maximum of 2n - 2 bishops, which for an 8x8 board is 14.\n\nFinally, to find the number of edge squares that would lack bishops, we subtract the maximum number of bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (maximum bishops) = 14.\n\nThus, if they succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, 14 edge squares would remain empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
