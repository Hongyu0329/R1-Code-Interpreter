    "To find the number that should be filled in the parentheses in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the pattern governing the series.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms:\n*   The first term is 2.\n*   The second term is 11.\n*   The third term is 23.\n*   The fourth term is 51.\n*   The fifth term is 119.\n\nA common method for discovering the pattern in a sequence is to examine the differences between consecutive numbers or to see if there's a multiplicative relationship.\n\nLet's try a pattern that involves both multiplication and addition. We can express each term (starting from the second) based on the preceding term:\n*   11 = (2 * 2) + 7\n*   23 = (11 * 2) + 1\n*   51 = (23 * 2) + 5\n*   119 = (51 * 2) + 17\n\nNow, let's look at the numbers that are being added: 7, 1, 5, 17. At first glance, there isn't an obvious pattern. However, let's examine the differences between these added numbers:\n*   1 - 7 = -6\n*   5 - 1 = 4\n*   17 - 5 = 12\n\nLet's look at the differences of these results:\n*   4 - (-6) = 10\n*   12 - 4 = 8\n\nThis level of differencing does not reveal a simple pattern.\n\nLet's try another approach. A frequently observed pattern in number series problems is a relationship based on powers of a number. Let's try to relate the sequence to powers of 2:\n*   2 = 2¹ + 0\n*   11 = 2³ + 3\n*   23 = 2⁴ + 7\n*   51 = 2⁵ + 19\n*   119 = 2⁶ + 55\n\nLet's examine the sequence of the numbers added to the powers of 2: 0, 3, 7, 19, 55. Let's find the differences between these numbers:\n*   3 - 0 = 3\n*   7 - 3 = 4\n*   19 - 7 = 12\n*   55 - 19 = 36\n\nNow, let's look at the pattern in this new sequence of differences: 3, 4, 12, 36. Starting from the second number (4), the subsequent numbers are found by multiplying by 3:\n*   4 * 3 = 12\n*   12 * 3 = 36\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be 36 * 3 = 108.\n\nWe can now find the next number to be added to the power of 2. It would be the last number in our added sequence (55) plus the next difference (108):\n*   55 + 108 = 163\n\nThe next term in the main sequence would then be 2⁷ plus this new number:\n*   Next term = 2⁷ + 163 = 128 + 163 = 291.\n\nThus, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
