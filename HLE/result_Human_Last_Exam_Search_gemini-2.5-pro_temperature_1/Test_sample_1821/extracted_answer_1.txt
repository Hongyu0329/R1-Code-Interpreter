The number of cardinalities in the interval $[|T_1|, |T_2|]$ is not fixed by the axioms of ZFC. It depends on the cardinality of the continuum at $\omega_2$. Assuming the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, there are 2 cardinalities. However, without this assumption, the number of cardinalities can be any cardinal number that is consistently a possible value for the size of the power set of $\omega_2$.
