    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is D3h.\n\nTo determine the symmetry, the SMILES string was first converted into a 3D molecular structure. Online tools can be used for this conversion. The resulting structure is a large, planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a triangular shape. It has three ethynyl (-C≡CH) groups attached to its vertices. This class of molecules is related to triangulenes or triangular graphene fragments.\n\nThe symmetry elements present in this molecule are:\n*   **A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃):** This axis passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n*   **Three two-fold axes of rotation (C₂):** These axes lie within the plane of the molecule, pass through its center, and are perpendicular to the principal C₃ axis. Each C₂ axis goes through one of the molecular vertices.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σh):** As the molecule is planar, its molecular plane acts as a mirror plane.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σv):** Each of these planes contains the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   **An improper three-fold axis of rotation (S₃):** This operation involves a 120° rotation followed by a reflection through the horizontal plane.\n*   **The identity element (E):** As with all molecules, this operation consists of doing nothing.\n\nA molecule that possesses a principal Cn axis and n C₂ axes perpendicular to it belongs to a D point group. Since this molecule has a C₃ axis and three perpendicular C₂ axes, it belongs to the D₃ family. The presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) further classifies it specifically into the D3h point group.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
