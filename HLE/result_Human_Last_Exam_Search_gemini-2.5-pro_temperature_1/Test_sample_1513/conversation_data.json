    "The island town that fits the description is **Hanga Roa**, located on **Easter Island** (also known as Rapa Nui).\n\nHere is a breakdown of how it meets the criteria:\n\n*   **More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island:** Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, which is over 2,000 kilometers away.\n\n*   **Sits on a bay:** The main town and capital of Easter Island is Hanga Roa. The name \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"long bay\" or \"wide bay\" in the Rapa Nui language. The town is situated on the west coast of the island along this bay.\n\n*   **Formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name:** The town of Hanga Roa is nestled in the lowlands between two extinct volcanoes, Maunga Terevaka and the significant volcanic caldera of Rano Kau. While Hanga Roa Bay itself is not the caldera, the town's name is synonymous with the bay it sits on, and it is directly adjacent to the prominent Rano Kau caldera, which has a large crater lake. This close association and the town's name being the bay's description fulfill the essence of the query.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
