In the context of the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ is given by the quadratic part of the Euclidean action:
$(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(\vec{x}, \tau) (-\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2) \phi(\vec{x}, \tau)$
where $\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\tau$ is the imaginary time, $\vec{x}$ are the spatial coordinates, and $m$ is the mass of the scalar field. This expression represents the free part of the Euclidean action for the scalar field.
