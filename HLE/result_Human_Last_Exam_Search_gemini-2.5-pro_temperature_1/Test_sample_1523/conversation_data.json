    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function $Z$ for a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ is expressed through the functional integral formalism. This is achieved by performing a Wick rotation to Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate is imaginary, $\\tau = it$, and is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature.\n\nThe partition function is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\nwhere the integration is over all field configurations $\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$ that are periodic in the imaginary time direction with period $\\beta$. $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action of the scalar field.\n\nFor a non-interacting (free) neutral scalar field with mass $m$, the Euclidean action is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density over Euclidean spacetime:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nThis can be written more compactly using the four-dimensional Euclidean Laplacian, $\\partial_E^2 = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int d^4x_E \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\nwhere $d^4x_E = d\\tau d^3x$.\n\nThe expression in the exponent of the functional integral is often written in a form analogous to a Gaussian integral, which for a vector $\\vec{v}$ and a matrix $A$ is proportional to $e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\vec{v}^T A \\vec{v}}$. In field theory, the field $\\phi$ plays the role of the vector, and the operator in the action plays the role of the matrix. The \"inner product\" in this context refers to the quadratic form in the action.\n\nTo identify the operator $D_\\phi$, we can perform an integration by parts on the kinetic term of the action, assuming appropriate boundary conditions (which are satisfied by the periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction and fields vanishing at spatial infinity):\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\left[ -\\phi (\\partial_\\mu^E \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) (-\\partial_E^2 + m^2) \\phi(x_E)$\n\nThis is now in the form of an inner product. The inner product of two functions, say $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, in this function space is defined as $\\langle f, g \\rangle = \\int d^4x_E f(x_E) g(x_E)$. With this definition, the action can be written as:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\phi, D_\\phi \\phi \\rangle$\nwhere the operator $D_\\phi$ is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space:\n$D_\\phi = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$\n\nTherefore, the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature is the quadratic part of the Euclidean action.\n\n<<<In the context of the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is given by the quadratic part of the Euclidean action:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\\tau$ is the imaginary time, $\\vec{x}$ are the spatial coordinates, and $m$ is the mass of the scalar field. This expression represents the free part of the Euclidean action for the scalar field."
