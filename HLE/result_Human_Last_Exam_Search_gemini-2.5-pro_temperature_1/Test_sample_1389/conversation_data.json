    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the commonly used formula for vaccine efficacy, 1 - incidence rate ratio (1-IRR), correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n### Understanding the Model\n\nAn \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine model assumes that the vaccine provides perfect protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while offering no protection to the rest. For example, a vaccine with 80% efficacy would completely protect 80% of recipients, leaving the other 20% fully susceptible, just like unvaccinated individuals. This contrasts with a \"leaky\" vaccine, where every recipient receives partial protection, meaning their risk per exposure is reduced but not eliminated.\n\n### The Calculation\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of why 1-IRR accurately reflects per-exposure efficacy in this specific model:\n\n1.  **Define Incidence Rates:**\n    *   Let the incidence rate (or hazard of infection) in the unvaccinated group be `IR_unvaccinated`.\n    *   In an all-or-nothing vaccine, let `p` be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected. Their incidence rate is 0.\n    *   The remaining proportion, `1-p`, has the same incidence rate as the unvaccinated group, `IR_unvaccinated`.\n    *   Therefore, the average incidence rate in the entire vaccinated group (`IR_vaccinated`) is `(p * 0) + ((1-p) * IR_unvaccinated) = (1-p) * IR_unvaccinated`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):**\n    *   The IRR is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the unvaccinated group.\n    *   `IRR = IR_vaccinated / IR_unvaccinated = ((1-p) * IR_unvaccinated) / IR_unvaccinated = 1-p`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Vaccine Efficacy (VE) from IRR:**\n    *   The standard formula for vaccine efficacy based on incidence rates is `VE = 1 - IRR`.\n    *   Substituting the IRR from the step above: `VE = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n    *   This shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the `1-IRR` formula estimates `p`, the proportion of the vaccinated population that is completely protected.\n\n4.  **Relate to Per-Exposure Efficacy:**\n    *   Per-exposure efficacy is the reduction in the risk of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen.\n    *   In the unvaccinated group, let the risk per exposure be `r`.\n    *   In the vaccinated group, the average risk per exposure is calculated across both protected and unprotected individuals: `(p * 0) + ((1-p) * r) = (1-p)r`.\n    *   The per-exposure efficacy is the relative reduction in this average risk: `1 - (average risk in vaccinated / risk in unvaccinated) = 1 - ((1-p)r / r) = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n\nSince both the `1-IRR` calculation and the definition of average per-exposure efficacy result in `p`, the `1-IRR` formula correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n<<<C>>>"
