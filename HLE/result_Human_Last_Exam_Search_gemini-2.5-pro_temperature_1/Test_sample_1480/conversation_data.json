    "In the context of fuzzy logic, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent part, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the membership grade of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. A t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy sets.\n\nCommon t-norm operations include the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm (Gödel t-norm):** This is the most frequently used t-norm and is defined as the minimum of the two values.\n*   **Product t-norm:** This t-norm calculates the product of the two values.\n\nGiven the values `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, the rule activation level can be calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Using the minimum t-norm:**\n    `activation_level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Using the product t-norm:**\n    `activation_level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not provided in the question, the activation level would be 0.7 if using the common minimum t-norm, or 0.63 if using the product t-norm. For the purpose of providing a single answer, the minimum t-norm is often the default assumption.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
