    "The surname is that of the English poet Alexander Pope.\n\nThis is the solution to a well-known literary and translation puzzle. The \"essay\" in question is the introductory text of Graham Greene's 1949 novel and screenplay, *The Third Man*, which is set in and vividly describes post-war Vienna with its wide boulevards.\n\nIn the original English version, there is a minor character named Crabbin. His name is an apparent reference to the 18th-century English poet George Crabbe. However, in the classic Russian translation of the novel, the translators changed the character's name to \"Поуп\" (Poup). This is the standard Russian transliteration for the surname of another prominent 18th-century English poet, Alexander Pope.\n\nTherefore, in the Russian translation, the surname \"Pope\" appears in the narrative that is set against the backdrop of Vienna's boulevards.\n\n<<<Pope>>>"
