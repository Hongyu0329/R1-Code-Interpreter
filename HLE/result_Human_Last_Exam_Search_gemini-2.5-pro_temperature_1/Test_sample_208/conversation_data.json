    "The first step of finding the densest packing is complete. The search results indicate that the problem of packing circles in a circle is a known mathematical problem. Specifically, result mentions that proven solutions for the optimal packing of n circles have been established for n=12, 13, 14, and 19. It also points to a website, packomania.com, for conjectured and proven solutions. I need to find the specific arrangement for 14 circles and the corresponding radius ratio.The search results from step 2, particularly from \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" on packomania.com, provide a table with detailed information for packing different numbers of circles. I need to find the entry for N=14 in this table to get the ratio of the container circle's radius to the small circles' radius.I have successfully found the table from packomania.com in the search results of step 2. The result from \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" provides a comprehensive table with columns for the number of circles (N), the radius of the small circles (assuming the large circle has a radius of 1), and the ratio of the large circle's radius to the small circle's radius. I need to locate the row for N=14 in this table to find the required ratio.\n\nThe table in one of the search results provides the following information for N=14:\n- **radius:** 0.2274941238\n- **ratio:** 4.3957261394\n\nThe 'radius' is the radius of the small circles when the large circle has a radius of 1. The 'ratio' is the radius of the large circle when the small circles have a radius of 1. Since the problem states that the fourteen circles have a radius of one, the radius of the large circle is directly given by the 'ratio' value.\n\nI now have all the necessary information. The radius of the large circle is the 'ratio' value, which is approximately 4.3957. I need to round this to 4 significant digits.\n\nRadius = 4.3957261394\nRounding to 4 significant digits gives 4.396.\nFor fourteen circles of radius one to be tightly packed into another circle, the radius of the larger circle is approximately 4.396. This is based on the densest known packing arrangement for 14 equal circles within a larger circle.\n\nThe problem of packing a given number of equal circles into a larger circle is a known mathematical challenge. For 14 circles, the optimal arrangement has been studied and the ratio of the radius of the containing circle to the radius of the smaller circles has been determined. According to the best-known packing configurations, the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles is approximately 4.3957261394.\n\nSince the radius of each of the fourteen smaller circles is given as one, the radius of the large containing circle is this ratio multiplied by one. When rounded to four significant digits, the radius is 4.396.\n\n<<<4.396>>>"
