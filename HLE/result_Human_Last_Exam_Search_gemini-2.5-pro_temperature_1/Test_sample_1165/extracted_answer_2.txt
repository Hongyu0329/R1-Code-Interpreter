The estimated maximum magnitude of fluctuations for the uniform case is `R(ε) ∝ ε^(1/2)`. The scaling for `R(ε)` is expected to change if `z_i` follows the specified normal distribution. In the normal distribution case, the positions of the sources are much less random, with a variance proportional to `ε²`. This increased rigidity in the source locations leads to a reduction in the overall fluctuation of the solution `y(x)`. The new scaling is expected to be `R(ε) ∝ ε^(3/2)`.
