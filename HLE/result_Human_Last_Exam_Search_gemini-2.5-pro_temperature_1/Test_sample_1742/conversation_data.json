    "In the category of modules over the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module is the module $T = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3$, where $S_i$ are the simple modules corresponding to the vertices of the quiver.\n\nHere is a justification of this answer:\n\n### The Algebra and its Modules\n\nThe path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the algebra of the linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$. This algebra is hereditary and representation-finite. The indecomposable modules over this algebra are well-understood. Let's denote the simple module at vertex $i$ by $S_i$, the projective cover of $S_i$ by $P_i$, and the injective hull of $S_i$ by $I_i$.\n\nThe six indecomposable $A$-modules can be represented by their dimension vectors:\n*   $S_1 = (1,0,0)$, which is also the injective module $I_1$.\n*   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$.\n*   $S_3 = (0,0,1)$, which is also the projective module $P_3$.\n*   $I_2 = (1,1,0)$, the injective hull of $S_2$.\n*   $P_2 = (0,1,1)$, the projective cover of $S_2$.\n*   $P_1 = (1,1,1)$, which is also the injective module $I_3$.\n\n### The Auslander-Reiten Quiver\n\nThe structure of the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver for this algebra is crucial. It visualizes the irreducible maps between the indecomposable modules and the action of the Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau$. The AR quiver for $A_3$ is:\n\n```\n      P₁\n     / \\\n   I₂   P₂\n   / \\ / \\\n S₁   S₂   S₃\n```\n\n### $\\tau$-Tilting Modules\n\nFor a hereditary algebra like this one, the notions of a tilting module and a $\\tau$-tilting module coincide. A module $T$ is a tilting module if it is the direct sum of $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable modules, and $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$. For this algebra, there are 14 such modules.\n\n### Slice Modules\n\nA slice in the AR-quiver is a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of indecomposable modules that \"cuts\" the quiver. More formally, a slice is a set of indecomposable modules that contains exactly one module from each $\\tau$-orbit and is closed under paths of irreducible maps. A tilting module whose indecomposable summands form a slice is called a slice module.\n\nVisually, a slice cannot contain two modules $M$ and $N$ where there is an oriented path of irreducible maps from $M$ to $N$. Let's examine some of the tilting modules:\n\n*   **The projective tilting module $T_P = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$:** The set of its summands $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$ is a slice. It forms a path from right to left in the AR quiver.\n*   **The injective tilting module $T_I = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$:** The set of its summands $\\{S_1, I_2, P_1\\}$ is also a slice.\n*   **The module $T = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3$:** This can be shown to be a tilting module because $\\text{Ext}^1(S_i, S_j) = 0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. However, its set of summands $\\{S_1, S_2, S_3\\}$ is not a slice. In the AR-quiver, there are paths of irreducible maps $S_1 \\to I_2 \\to P_1$ and $S_3 \\to P_2 \\to P_1$, and also irreducible maps from $S_1$ and $S_3$ towards $S_2$ via middle terms $I_2$ and $P_2$. A key property of a slice is that there are no paths between its modules. The summands $\\{S_1, S_2, S_3\\}$ lie at the \"bottom\" of the AR-quiver, and there are several paths of irreducible maps starting from them but not between them. However, they do not form a \"cut\" across the quiver; they form an antichain with respect to the ordering given by irreducible maps, but this is not sufficient to be a slice. No slice contains all three simple modules.\n\nIt has been established that for a path algebra of a Dynkin quiver, there is exactly one tilting module which is not a slice module, and this module is the direct sum of all simple modules.\n\n<<< $S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3$ >>>"
