    "Kurt Vonnegut is the man who, as he himself noted in his novel *Player Piano*, could be described as looking like a porcupine. This comparison arises from a passage in the book describing a picture of a man so riddled with arrows that he resembled the spiky creature. While this was a specific image, Vonnegut himself was known for his unruly, curly hair, often described as a \"mop,\" which gave him a distinctive and somewhat prickly appearance in photographs.\n\nAlthough he was affectionately called 'K' by his family and close friends, a fitting two-word descriptor that starts with the same letter, reflecting both his appearance and his sharp, satirical wit, is \"Kurt the Curmudgeon.\" However, a more direct answer based on the visual description is:\n\n<<<Kurt's Kurls>>>"
