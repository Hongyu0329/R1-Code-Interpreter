    "The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is commonly known as Rhodamine B. While this synthetic dye produces a vibrant pinkish-purple color, there is no evidence to suggest that it is used in any Crayola crayon.\n\nCrayola crayons are made from paraffin wax and colored pigments. The specific chemical composition of the pigments used in Crayola crayons is a trade secret and is not publicly disclosed.\n\nRhodamine B is a fluorescent dye that has raised health concerns. It is considered potentially carcinogenic and its use in food products is restricted or banned by regulatory bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in the European Union. Given that Crayola crayons are non-toxic and intended for use by children, it is highly improbable that they would contain a substance with known health risks.\n\nSome online images may show a crayon with the \"Rhodamine B\" label, but these are illustrative examples of chemicals that produce a similar color and do not represent the actual ingredients of the crayon.\n\nTherefore, no Crayola crayon color contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n<<<There is no Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.>>>"
