Here are the equations for the absorption cross-section for a chain of molecules absorbing an ultrashort Gaussian-shape laser pulse, within the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory for transitions below the Fermi level.

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected:**

The absorption cross-section per molecule, σ_a(ω), is a sum over all possible transitions from occupied molecular orbitals |φ_i⟩ to unoccupied molecular orbitals |φ_f⟩:

σ_a(ω) = C ⋅ ω ⋅ Σ_{i,f} f(E_i)(1-f(E_f)) |**μ**_if|² G(ω - ω_if)

where:
*   C is a constant incorporating fundamental physical constants.
*   ω is the angular frequency of the light.
*   f(E) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, ensuring transitions are from occupied to empty states.
*   **μ**_if = ⟨φ_f|**μ**|φ_i⟩ is the transition dipole moment between the initial and final molecular orbitals.
*   ω_if = (E_f - E_i)/ħ is the transition frequency.
*   G(ω - ω_if) is a Gaussian lineshape function reflecting the spectral profile of the laser pulse, centered at the transition frequency ω_if.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered:**

When nearest-neighbor interactions are included, the absorption is dominated by the transition to the collective, delocalized k=0 exciton state. The absorption cross-section per molecule, σ_b(ω), is given by:

σ_b(ω) = C ⋅ ω ⋅ |**μ**_mol|² G(ω - ω_0)

where:
*   C is the same constant as in part (a).
*   ω is the angular frequency of the light.
*   **μ**_mol is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule. The collective nature of the exciton enhances the total transition moment of the chain by a factor of √N (where N is the number of molecules), but this equation represents the cross-section per molecule.
*   ω_0 = (E_mol + 2V)/ħ is the frequency of the k=0 exciton, shifted from the single-molecule transition frequency E_mol/ħ by the interaction energy term 2V.
*   G(ω - ω_0) is the Gaussian lineshape function centered at the k=0 exciton transition frequency.
