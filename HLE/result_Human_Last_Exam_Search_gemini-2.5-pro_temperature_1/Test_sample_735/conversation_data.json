    "There are exactly 12 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (also referred to as locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart. In their work, they proved that any such group must have an order of at most 24. Their paper provides a complete list of these groups.\n\nThe 12 finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂, C₁₄\n*   **Dihedral groups:** D₆, D₈, D₁₀\n*   **Alternating group:** A₄\n*   **Quaternion group:** Q₈\n*   **Dicyclic group:** Q₁₂ (also known as the dicyclic group of order 12)\n\nIt is noteworthy that for some of these groups, there can be more than one distinct maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 up to automorphism.\n\n<<<12>>>"
