    "There are 14 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. The concept of a product-free set `S` in a group `G` is a set where for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (also known as locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of these groups was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their 2009 paper, \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". While the term \"sum-free\" is used, it is equivalent to \"product-free\" in the context of general group theory. Their analysis shows that a finite group `G` has a maximal product-free set of size 2 if and only if `G` is one of the following 14 groups:\n\n**Cyclic Groups:**\n*   **C4**: The cyclic group of order 4.\n*   **C5**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n*   **C6**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n*   **C7**: The cyclic group of order 7.\n*   **C8**: The cyclic group of order 8.\n\n**Dihedral Groups:**\n*   **D6**: The dihedral group of order 6 (isomorphic to the symmetric group S3).\n*   **D8**: The dihedral group of order 8.\n\n**Quaternion and Dicyclic Groups:**\n*   **Q8**: The quaternion group of order 8.\n*   **Q12**: The dicyclic group of order 12.\n\n**Direct Products:**\n*   **C2 x C2**: The Klein four-group.\n*   **C4 x C2**: The direct product of the cyclic groups of order 4 and 2.\n*   **C2 x C2 x C2**: The elementary abelian group of order 8.\n*   **D6 x C2**: The direct product of the dihedral group of order 6 and the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n**Other:**\n*   **M(16)**: The modular group of order 16, with presentation ⟨g,h | g⁴ = 1, h⁴ = 1, hg = g⁻¹h⟩.\n\nThis complete classification arises from considering cases where the maximal product-free set of size two generates the group, and cases where it does not.\n\n<<<14>>>"
