    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), which is measured by the proportion of phenotypic variance it can explain (R²), is fundamentally limited by the SNP heritability of the phenotype. SNP heritability (h²_snp) represents the total proportion of variation in a trait that is due to the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is the case:\n\n*   **SNP heritability as a theoretical maximum:** SNP heritability is considered the theoretical upper limit for the predictive power of a PGS that is based on those same SNPs. In an ideal scenario, with a perfectly accurate estimation of SNP effects from an infinitely large dataset, the variance explained by the PGS would approach the SNP heritability.\n\n*   **Practical limitations of Polygenic Scores:** In reality, the predictive power of current polygenic scores is substantially lower than the SNP heritability. This discrepancy, often called the \"missing heritability gap,\" is due to several factors:\n    *   **Inaccurate effect size estimates:** The effect sizes for individual SNPs are estimated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with finite sample sizes, which introduces statistical noise and error.\n    *   **Differences between study populations:** The genetic makeup and environmental factors can differ between the population used to develop the PGS (the base data) and the population it is applied to (the target data), reducing its accuracy.\n    *   **Incomplete capture of genetic variants:** Polygenic scores are typically built using common SNPs and may not include the effects of rare variants, structural variations, or complex gene-gene interactions (epistasis), all of which can contribute to the true heritability of a trait.\n\nWhile some studies have reported instances where the variance explained by a PGS (R²) exceeded the *estimated* SNP heritability, this is often due to specific analytical circumstances, such as heterogeneity between the different cohorts used in a meta-analysis, which can lead to an underestimation of the true SNP heritability. Therefore, the principle that the true SNP heritability sets the upper bound on the predictive accuracy of a PGS remains valid. Since a PGS is an imperfect tool with inherent limitations, its predictive ability is necessarily lower than this theoretical maximum.\n\n<<<True>>>"
