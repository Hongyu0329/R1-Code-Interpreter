The second coefficient, `a_2`, in the heat kernel expansion for the square of the massless gauged Dirac operator in four dimensions is given by the local expression:
`a_2(x) = -\text{tr} \left[ \frac{1}{12}C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}C^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\mathbb{I} + \frac{1}{180} (5R^2 - 2R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} + 2R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma})\mathbb{I} - \frac{1}{2}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} \right]`
where `C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}` is the Weyl tensor, `R` is the scalar curvature, `R_{\mu\nu}` is the Ricci tensor, `R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}` is the Riemann tensor, and `F_{\mu\nu}` is the gauge field strength. The trace is over the gauge group representation.
