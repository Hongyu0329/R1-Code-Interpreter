    "The initial search has returned several documents that discuss the $A(\\alpha)$ stability of BDF methods. and appear to be particularly relevant as they mention the exact calculation of the stability angles. Specifically, they provide the context of the work by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis who discovered these exact values. even includes a figure of the stability domain for BDF4 and mentions the calculation of the angle $\\alpha$.,, and provide approximate values for $\\alpha$ for BDF4, which is around 73 degrees.\n\nThe key to finding the exact value seems to lie in the method described by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, which is referenced and simplified in the paper by Gander and Wanner. I need to carefully examine these sources to extract the exact formula for the angle $\\alpha$.\n\nThe next steps will be to:\n1.  Define $A(\\alpha)$ stability based on the provided search results.\n2.  Identify the stability polynomial for the BDF4 method from the search results, if available.\n3.  Focus on the papers by Gander & Wanner and Akrivis & Katsoprinakis to find the exact expression for the stability angle of BDF4.\n4.  Express the final answer in the requested format.\n\nBased on the initial search, I believe I have sufficient information to proceed without further searches at this moment. I will now analyze the downloaded documents to find the exact value. After re-examining the results, I will perform more searches if needed.\n\nBased on the information from the initial search, specifically from Akrivis and Katsoprinakis (2019) and the simplified derivation by Gander and Wanner, the exact value for the $A(\\alpha)$ stability angle of the BDF4 method can be determined.\n\nA method is considered $A(\\alpha)$-stable if its stability region includes the angular sector $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$. For the BDF4 method, the boundary of the stability region is given by the root locus curve. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangent from the origin to this curve.\n\nAkrivis and Katsoprinakis found the exact maximum angles of $A(\\vartheta)$-stability for BDF methods. For BDF4, this angle $\\vartheta_4$ (which is the same as $\\alpha$ in our notation) is given by:\n\n$\\tan(\\vartheta_4) = \\sqrt{f_4(\\tilde{x}_4)}$\n\nwhere $f_4(x) = \\frac{4(1-x)^4(12x^2 - 16x + 7)^2}{(24x^3 - 54x^2 + 44x - 13)^2(1+x)}$ and $\\tilde{x}_4$ is the unique root of the polynomial $p_4(x) = 24x^4 - 60x^3 + 50x^2 - 15x + 1$ in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nSolving for the root $\\tilde{x}_4$ and substituting it into the expression for $\\tan(\\vartheta_4)$ gives a precise, yet complex, expression. However, a more direct result for the tangent of the angle has been derived.\n\nAccording to Gander and Wanner's simplification of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis's work, the tangent of the stability angle for BDF4 can be expressed in a more direct form. The search result gives a complex-looking formula for a value `p0 = tan α`. Let's analyze that. A closer look at the research papers is needed to confirm the exact simplified expression.\n\nUpon further review of the available information and understanding the complexity of the exact expression, it is best to directly use the result from the scientific literature. The work of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, as presented in various sources, gives the exact value.\n\nLet's look for a more simplified exact expression in the papers. The paper by Gander and Wanner provides a method using Maple to find the tangent of the angle, which they call `p0`.\n\nAfter a thorough analysis of the provided search results, an exact value for the angle $\\alpha$ in terms of `arctan` can be constructed. The key is in the work of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, and its simplification by Gander and Wanner.\n\nLet's find the exact value of $\\tan(\\alpha)$. According to Akrivis and Katsoprinakis (2019), the cosine of the angle that determines the stability region boundary is the largest root $\\tilde{x}_4$ of the polynomial $p_4(t) = 24t^4 - 60t^3 + 50t^2 - 15t + 1$ in $[-1, 1]$. Then $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\sqrt{f_4(\\tilde{x}_4)}$. While this provides a path to the exact value, it is computationally intensive to express in a simple closed form.\n\nHowever, a direct value for the tangent of the angle for BDF4 is given as approximately $\\tan(73.35^\\circ)$, which is not an exact expression in terms of integers or simple radicals.\n\nLet's revisit the search result, which seems to hold the key. The paper by Gander and Wanner mentions an exact value for `p0 = tan α` for k=4 (BDF4). This is the value we are looking for. The formula is given in a complex form involving `sqrt(2033)`.\n\nLet's find the explicit formula for BDF4 from a reliable source. A re-examination of is in order. The paper states: \"For k = 3, 4 and 6, this t2_0 is rational, which leads to expressions for p0 = tan α containing only one square root\". This indicates that an exact expression for tan(α) exists for BDF4.\n\nThe paper doesn't explicitly write out the formula for BDF4 in the abstract, but it shows it for BDF3 and gives a table with values of `t2_0`. Let's search for the paper by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis directly to find the explicit formula.\n\nI will perform a new search to find the original paper by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis (2019) which should contain the explicit formula for the stability angle of BDF4.The new search successfully located the key papers. The paper \"Exact BDF Stability Angles with Maple\" by Gander and Wanner explicitly mentions the work of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and provides a simplified method to obtain the exact stability angles. More importantly, it contains a figure of the stability domain for BDF4 and gives a formula for `p0 = tan α` for BDF4, which is precisely what is needed to answer the user's request. The formula involves `sqrt(2033)`. The paper \"MAXIMUM ANGLES OF A(ϑ)-STABILITY OF BACKWARD DIFFERENCE FORMULAE\" by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis provides the theoretical foundation for these exact values.\n\nI now have all the necessary information to construct the final answer. The exact value of the tangent of the angle is given in the first search result. I will use this to express the angle $\\alpha$ in terms of `arctan()`.\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$ stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by $\\alpha = \\arctan(p_0)$, where $p_0$ is the tangent of the stability angle. According to the paper \"Exact BDF Stability Angles with Maple\" by Gander and Wanner, which simplifies the results of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, the exact value for this tangent for BDF4 is:\n\n$p_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{-51844971 + \\frac{5765167}{10} \\sqrt{2033}}{14086400 \\left( 8525 + 155 \\sqrt{2033} \\right)}}$\n\nHowever, this expression seems overly complex and might be a misinterpretation of the formula presented in the abstract. Let's look at the components of the formula in the search result again: `p0 = − 51844971 14086400 + 5765167 70432000 √ 2033 q 8525 + 155 √ 2033`. It is more likely that the expression is a sum of terms. Awaiting the full text of the paper would be ideal, but based on the structure, it is likely a rational expression involving $\\sqrt{2033}$.\n\nLet's look for another representation of this value. The paper by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis gives $\\tan(\\vartheta_4) = \\sqrt{f_4(\\tilde{x}_4)}$, where $\\tilde{x}_4$ is a root of a polynomial. This suggests the argument of the square root should be positive.\n\nLet's re-examine the search result from Gander and Wanner. It gives `p0 = − 51844971 14086400 + 5765167 70432000 √ 2033 q 8525 + 155 √ 2033`. The \"q\" seems to be a typo for a square root or some other mathematical symbol. Let's try to find a clearer version of this formula.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the search snippets, it's clear that the exact formula is complex. However, the search result from Gander and Wanner is the most promising lead. The term `q` is likely a square root. Let's assume `q` stands for `sqrt`. So the expression for `p0^2` would be `(8525 + 155 * sqrt(2033))`. And `p0` would be a more complex expression.\n\nLet's search for the paper \"Exact BDF Stability Angles with Maple\" online to see if a clearer version of the formula is available. Since I cannot browse in real-time, I have to rely on the provided snippets. The snippets are the most reliable source I have.\n\nLet's try to reconstruct the formula from the snippet, assuming a typo. The structure `p0 = ... q ...` is unusual. It's possible that the expression for `p0` is under a square root.\n\nLet's assume the value provided in other sources of $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$ is correct. Then $\\tan(73.35^\\circ) \\approx 3.34$. The expression from the snippet must evaluate to this value.\n\nLet's consider another approach. The boundary of the stability region is given by the set of points $w(z) = \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\frac{1}{j}(1-z^{-1})^j$ for $|z|=1$. We want to find the maximum of $\\frac{\\mathrm{Im}(w)}{-\\mathrm{Re}(w)}$. This is a calculus problem that leads to the polynomial equations found by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most reliable path is to cite the result from the literature. The Gander and Wanner paper is the key. Let's try to parse the formula again.\n\n`p0 = − 51844971 14086400 + 5765167 70432000 √ 2033 q 8525 + 155 √ 2033`\n\nLet's assume there is a division and a square root. It could be that the expression inside the square root is a fraction.\n\nGiven the difficulty in parsing the exact formula from the snippet and the high chance of error in reconstruction, the most responsible approach is to state the formula in a way that refers to its origin and acknowledges the complexity, while providing the user with the most accurate representation possible from the search results.\n\nI will present the answer based on the formula from Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, as it is more clearly stated, even if it is in an implicit form.\n\nThe maximum angle $\\alpha$ for A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method is given by $\\alpha = \\arctan(c_4)$, where $c_4 = \\max_{t \\in [-1, 1]} \\sqrt{f_4(t)}$ and $f_4(t) = \\frac{4(1-t)^4(12t^2-16t+7)^2}{(1+t)(24t^3-54t^2+44t-13)^2}$. The value of $t$ that maximizes this expression is the largest root of the polynomial $p_4(t) = 24t^4 - 60t^3 + 50t^2 - 15t + 1$ in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nWhile this provides the formal expression, it is not in a simple closed form. The paper by Gander and Wanner provides a result derived from this, and while the snippet is hard to parse, it points to an exact, albeit complex, value.\n\nLet's go with the explicit, if complicated, formulation. The scientific papers are clear that an exact value exists.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is $\\arctan(\\sqrt{c})$ where c is a specific, but complex, number. I will express this based on the most reliable source.\n\nLet's try one final search to see if there is a clear representation of the constant for BDF4.I have performed multiple searches and have consistently found references to the work of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, and its simplification by Gander and Wanner, as the source for the exact stability angle of the BDF4 method. The snippets confirm that an exact, closed-form expression for the tangent of the angle exists and involves $\\sqrt{2033}$.\n\nThe primary challenge has been the difficulty in accurately transcribing the formula from the search result snippets, which appear to have transcription errors (e.g., the letter 'q'). However, the paper by Gander and Wanner is clearly identified as containing the simplified result.\n\nBased on a careful re-examination of the snippet from Gander and Wanner, and cross-referencing with the known approximate value of $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$, it is possible to make an educated guess about the structure of the formula. However, to maintain accuracy and avoid hallucination, it is best to present the formula as found in the most reliable sources, even if it is in a less simplified form.\n\nThe work by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis provides a method to find the tangent of the angle, $\\tan(\\alpha)$, as the maximum of a specific function. This is an exact representation, although not a simple number.\n\nI will provide the answer based on the implicit definition from Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, as this is the most accurately represented form in the search results. I will also mention the existence of the explicit, but complex, formula from Gander and Wanner. This approach avoids potential errors from interpreting the garbled formula in the snippet while still providing the user with the most precise information available. I believe I have sufficient information to provide the final answer without further searches.\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$ stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan \\left( \\sqrt{\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]} f_4(x)} \\right)$\nwhere\n$f_4(x) = \\frac{4(1-x)^4(12x^2 - 16x + 7)^2}{(1+x)(24x^3 - 54x^2 + 44x - 13)^2}$\nThe value of $x$ that maximizes $f_4(x)$ is the unique root in $[-1, 1]$ of the polynomial $p_4(x) = 24x^4 - 60x^3 + 50x^2 - 15x + 1$.\n\nWhile this expression is exact, it is not in a simple closed form. Researchers Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, and later Gander and Wanner, have found an explicit, though complex, closed-form for this value. The value is approximately $73.35^\\circ$. The work by Gander and Wanner shows that the tangent of the angle can be expressed using radicals, involving $\\sqrt{2033}$.\n\nBased on the available information, the exact value is best expressed in the implicit form given above.\n\nI will now format the final answer.\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ (in radians) for the $A(\\alpha)$ stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan \\left( c_4 \\right)$\nwhere $c_4$ is the tangent of the maximum angle of stability.\n\nIn their work, Akrivis and Katsoprinakis derived an exact expression for this value. For the BDF4 method, the maximum angle $\\vartheta_4$ (which corresponds to $\\alpha$) is determined by the relation $\\tan(\\vartheta_4) = \\sqrt{f_4(\\tilde{x}_4)}$, where $\\tilde{x}_4$ is the unique root of the polynomial $p_4(x) = 24x^4 - 60x^3 + 50x^2 - 15x + 1$ in the interval $[-1, 1]$, and the function $f_4(x)$ is given by $f_4(x) = \\frac{4(1-x)^4(12x^2 - 16x + 7)^2}{(1+x)(24x^3 - 54x^2 + 44x - 13)^2}$.\n\nGander and Wanner simplified this result and provided an explicit, albeit complex, value for the tangent of the angle for BDF4, which involves the square root of 2033. While the precise transcription of this formula from the available snippets is challenging, its existence confirms that a closed-form expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of `arctan()` and radicals is available in the literature.\n\nThe angle is approximately $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is given by arctan of the constant derived from the expressions above.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan \\left( \\sqrt{\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]} \\frac{4(1-x)^4(12x^2 - 16x + 7)^2}{(1+x)(24x^3 - 54x^2 + 44x - 13)^2}} \\right)$>>>"
