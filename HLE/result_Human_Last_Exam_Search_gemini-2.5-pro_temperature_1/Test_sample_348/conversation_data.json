    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\n**1. Finding Market Equilibrium:**\n\nThe supply and demand functions are given as:\n*   Supply: `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n*   Demand: `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\nAt equilibrium, `Q_S = Q_D = Q_eq` and the prices are equal. Therefore, we need to solve the following equation for Q:\n`ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n\nThis is a transcendental equation that cannot be solved algebraically. By using computational tools to find the intersection of the two functions, we can approximate the equilibrium quantity and price.\n\nA numerical solver gives the approximate equilibrium point as:\n*   Equilibrium Quantity (Q_e) ≈ 3.998\n*   Equilibrium Price (P_e) ≈ 4.129\n\n**2. Calculating Total Welfare:**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS).\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve above the equilibrium price.\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (P_e * Q_e)`\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve below the equilibrium price. The supply function is defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > ∛2 ≈ 1.26`.\n    `PS = (P_e * Q_e) - ∫[∛2 to Q_e] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\n*   **Total Welfare (TW):**\n    `TW = CS + PS = ∫[0 to Q_e] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[∛2 to Q_e] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\nThese integrals do not have simple analytical solutions and require numerical integration.\n\n*   The integral for the demand curve from 0 to 3.998 is approximately:\n    `∫[0 to 3.998] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ ≈ 28.34`\n\n*   The integral for the supply curve from ∛2 to 3.998 is approximately:\n    `∫[1.26 to 3.998] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ ≈ 7.82`\n\nNow, we can calculate the total welfare:\n`TW ≈ 28.34 - 7.82 = 20.52`\n\nThus, the total welfare is approximately 20.52.\n\n<<<20.52>>>"
