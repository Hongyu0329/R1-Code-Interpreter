    "The single known integer value that completes the sequence is **241011**.\n\nThe provided sequence: 24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296, originates from the \"Stepping Stones\" programming contest held by Al Zimmermann in August 2022. This sequence represents the best scores achieved for a specific problem within the contest.\n\nThe problem is a variation of the \"stones on an infinite chessboard\" problem, which is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A337663. In this puzzle, one starts by placing a number of '1's on a grid. Then, successively larger integers are placed, with each new integer being the sum of its eight neighbors. The score is the highest integer placed.\n\nThe specific sequence in the question corresponds to the winning scores for problem instances with 24 to 30 initial stones. As of the end of the contest in November 2022, the known sequence of top scores was 24663 (for 24 stones), 35005 (for 25 stones), 119261 (for 26 stones), 196219 (for 27 stones), 211770 (for 28 stones), and 227296 (for 29 stones). The value for 30 stones was unknown for a period.\n\nThe integer that completes this sequence is the winning score for 30 initial stones, which was found during the contest. That value is 241011.\n\n<<<241011>>>"
