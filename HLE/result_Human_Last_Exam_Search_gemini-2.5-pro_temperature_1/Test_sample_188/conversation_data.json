  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To determine the maximum length of the secret message, we must first understand the relationship between the symbols in the Ching and the characters in the Shu.\n\n1.  **Identify the character set for the message:** The secret message is written using the \"120 most common Chinese characters\" found in the Shu. This means our alphabet for the final message consists of 120 unique characters.\n\n2.  **Identify the symbols used for encryption:** The Ching contains symbols of \"yinyang-wuxing\". There are two yinyang options (yin and yang) and five wuxing elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth). This gives a total of 2 × 5 = 10 unique symbols available for encryption.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of symbols needed per character:** We need to find the minimum number of Ching symbols required to represent each of the 120 possible characters. Let this number be 'n'. Using 'n' symbols, we can create 10ⁿ unique combinations. We need to find the smallest integer 'n' such that 10ⁿ is greater than or equal to 120.\n    *   If n = 1, we can represent 10¹ = 10 characters, which is not enough.\n    *   If n = 2, we can represent 10² = 100 characters, which is still not enough.\n    *   If n = 3, we can represent 10³ = 1000 characters, which is sufficient to assign a unique 3-symbol code to each of the 120 characters.\n\n4.  **Calculate the maximum message length:** To maximize the length of the message, we assume the most efficient fixed-length encoding is used, which is 3 symbols from the Ching for every 1 character of the message. The Ching contains a total of 9999 symbols.\n\n    Maximum message length = (Total symbols in the Ching) / (Symbols needed per character)\n    Maximum message length = 9999 / 3 = 3333\n\nThe information about the Shu's total character count (~3000) and the various computation times is not relevant to calculating the maximum possible length of the encrypted message.\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 3333 characters.\n<<<3333>>>"
