    "The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 depends on the classification scheme, which is sensitive to the residue characteristic of the underlying field. There are two main classifications: a coarser one with 7 types and a finer one, particularly for residue characteristic 2, with 54 types.\n\nA broader classification identifies seven main types of stable reduction for a genus 2 curve:\n*   **Type I:** The stable reduction is a smooth genus 2 curve. This occurs when the curve has potentially good reduction.\n*   **Type II:** The stable reduction is an elliptic curve with an ordinary double point.\n*   **Type III:** The stable reduction is a projective line with two ordinary double points.\n*   **Type IV:** The stable reduction consists of two projective lines intersecting transversally at three points.\n*   **Type V:** The stable reduction is the union of two elliptic curves that intersect transversally at a single point.\n*   **Type VI:** The stable reduction is composed of an elliptic curve and a projective line with one ordinary double point, intersecting each other at one point.\n*   **Type VII:** Similar to Type VI, but both components are singular.\n\nA more detailed analysis, especially when considering the stable marked reduction of hyperelliptic genus 2 curves with their 6 Weierstrass points, reveals a greater number of combinatorial types. The number of these types is highly dependent on the residue characteristic of the valuation ring.\n\nFor residue characteristics other than 2, there are 7 possible combinatorial structures for the special fiber of the stable marked model.\n\nHowever, in the case of residue characteristic 2, the classification is significantly more complex. Research has identified **54 different combinatorial structures** for the special fiber of the stable marked model of a genus 2 curve. These 54 types are categorized based on the structure of the dual graph of the special fiber and the thicknesses of its double points. All 54 of these reduction types have been shown to be realized over the field of rational numbers **Q**.\n\nIn summary, while a general overview provides 7 types of stable reduction, a more fine-grained analysis, particularly in residue characteristic 2, expands this to 54 distinct types.\n\n<<<54>>>"
