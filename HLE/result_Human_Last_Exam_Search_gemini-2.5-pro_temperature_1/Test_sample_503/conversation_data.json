    "An internal adjunction in the 2-category $\\Delta$ between an object $[n]$ and an object $[m]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps (morphisms) $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$ that serve as the left and right adjoints, respectively.\n\nIn a locally posetal 2-category like $\\Delta$, where the 2-morphisms are given by the partial order ($h \\le k$ if $h(x) \\le k(x)$ for all $x$), the condition for $f$ to be left adjoint to $g$ ($f \\dashv g$) simplifies. The unit ($\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[n]} \\to g \\circ f$) and counit ($\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[m]}$) must exist. This translates to the following pointwise inequalities:\n1.  $\\mathrm{id}_{[n]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i) \\implies i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [n]$.\n2.  $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[m]}(j) \\implies f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [m]$.\n\nThese two conditions are equivalent to the more common definition of a Galois connection (or adjunction) between posets:\n$f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$.\n\nWe need to count the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $(f, g)$ with $f: \\to$ and $g: \\to$ that satisfy this condition. An adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, we can count the number of possible left adjoints $f$ or, equivalently, the number of possible right adjoints $g$.\n\n**Counting the Left Adjoints**\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves the bottom element (infimum), which means $f(0)=0$.\nLet's prove this from the condition $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$:\nSetting $i=0$, we get $f(0) \\le j \\iff 0 \\le g(j)$. Since the codomain of $g$ is $[n]$, the statement $0 \\le g(j)$ is always true. Therefore, $f(0) \\le j$ must be true for all $j \\in [m]$. The only element in $[m]$ that is less than or equal to all other elements is $0$. Thus, $f(0)=0$.\n\nConversely, any order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ with $f(0)=0$ has a right adjoint $g$, which can be defined as $g(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map is defined by the sequence of its values, so we must have:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we need to determine the values of $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$. This is a non-decreasing sequence of 23 numbers chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing $k$ items from a set of $n$ with replacement, where order does not matter (as the non-decreasing order is imposed). The formula is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{n \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n\n*   The number of values to choose is $k = 23$.\n*   The number of available options is $n = |\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}| = 38$.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\left(\\!\\!{38 \\choose 23}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Counting the Right Adjoints (for verification)**\n\nAn order-preserving map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves the top element (supremum), which means $g(m)=n$.\nLet's prove this from the condition $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$:\nSetting $j=m$, we get $f(i) \\le m \\iff i \\le g(m)$. Since the codomain of $f$ is $[m]$, the statement $f(i) \\le m$ is always true. Therefore, $i \\le g(m)$ must be true for all $i \\in [n]$. The only element in $[n]$ that is greater than or equal to all other elements is $n$. Thus, $g(m)=n$.\n\nSo, we can also count the number of order-preserving maps $g: \\to$ such that $g(37)=23$.\nWe must have:\n$0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le g(37) = 23$.\n\nWe need to determine the values of $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$. This is a non-decreasing sequence of 37 numbers chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n\n*   The number of values to choose is $k = 37$.\n*   The number of available options is $n = |\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}| = 24$.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\left(\\!\\!{24 \\choose 37}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nUsing the binomial identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we can see that the two calculations yield the same result:\n$\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<â€‹$\\binom{60}{23}$>>>"
