    "Until the late 19th century, the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome featured a unique architectural element on the Pantheon that was later removed. This consisted of two bell towers, added in the 17th century by order of Pope Urban VIII. These towers, often misattributed to the famed architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, were derisively nicknamed \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the ass's ears) by the Roman populace due to their unpopular design.\n\nThe bell towers were part of an effort to convert the ancient pagan temple into a more conventional-looking church. However, their aesthetic was widely criticized as clashing with the classical harmony of the Pantheon's original structure.\n\nContrary to the user's provided timeframe of 1950, the removal of these controversial towers occurred much earlier. Historical records indicate that the demolition took place between 1881 and 1883. This action was part of a series of steps taken to restore the Pantheon to its original appearance and to isolate it from surrounding structures.\n\nTherefore, the unique architectural feature that was removed from the Pantheon in the Piazza della Rotonda was the pair of 17th-century bell towers.\n\n<<<the two bell towers known as \"the ass's ears\">>>"
