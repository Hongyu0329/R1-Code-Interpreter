    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.**\n\nThe rarity of noble gases in Earth's total matter—encompassing the atmosphere, crust, and mantle—is determined by their elemental abundances. Among the six naturally occurring noble gases, radon is the least abundant, followed by xenon.\n\nThe atmosphere is the primary reservoir for most of Earth's noble gases. In this domain, the abundance of noble gases generally decreases as their atomic number increases, with a notable exception for argon. Argon is significantly more abundant due to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n\nOf the stable noble gases, xenon is the rarest. However, radon, which is a product of the radioactive decay of uranium and radium in the Earth's crust, is even rarer. Due to its short half-life of about 3.8 days, radon does not accumulate in significant quantities in the atmosphere or other terrestrial reservoirs.\n\nWhile the exact percentages of noble gases in all terrestrial matter are complex to calculate and can vary slightly based on the models used, the fundamental order of rarity remains consistent. The extreme scarcity of radon, a direct consequence of its radioactive nature and short-lived presence, made it the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002, a fact supported by foundational texts on noble gas geochemistry from that era, such as \"Noble Gas Geochemistry\" by Ozima and Podosek (2002).\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
