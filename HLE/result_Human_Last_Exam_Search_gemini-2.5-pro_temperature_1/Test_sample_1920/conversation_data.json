    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factorize the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. A search reveals the factorization of a related number, 160797, which is $3 \\times 53599$. The factorization for 160797 is given as $3 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 31$. This implies that $53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 31$.\n\nLet's verify this:\n$7 \\times 13 = 91$\n$17 \\times 31 = 527$\n$91 \\times 527 = 47957$, which is not 53599.\n\nLet's re-check the factorization of 53599. From another search result, a factorization of 160797 is $3 \\times 53599$. Another part of the same result gives the prime factors of 160797 as 3, 7, 13, 17, and 31. There seems to be a contradiction in the source.\n\nLet's perform the factorization directly:\n$53599 / 7 = 7657$\n$7657 / 13 = 589$\n$589 / 19 = 31$\n$31 / 31 = 1$\n\nSo, the correct prime factorization is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n### 2. Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1^{a_1}} \\chi_{p_2^{a_2}} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k^{a_k}}$, where $d = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is the prime factorization of $d$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is primitive. In our case, the prime factors are all to the power of 1, so $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a primitive character modulo $p$.\n\n### 3. Order of a Dirichlet Character\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We need the order of $\\chi$ to be 6.\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\nThe order of a character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ must divide $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\nThe orders of the component characters must be divisors of 6, i.e., they can be 1, 2, 3, or 6. For their lcm to be 6, at least one character must have an order that is a multiple of 2 (i.e., 2 or 6) and at least one must have an order that is a multiple of 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\n### 4. Number of Primitive Characters of a Given Order\nFor a prime conductor $p$, all non-trivial characters are primitive. The group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ (where $k$ must divide $p-1$) is $\\phi(k)$.\n\nLet's calculate $p-1$ for each prime factor:\n*   $p_1=7: p_1-1 = 6$\n*   $p_2=13: p_2-1 = 12$\n*   $p_3=19: p_3-1 = 18$\n*   $p_4=31: p_4-1 = 30$\n\nThe possible orders for the characters (1, 2, 3, 6) are divisors of all the $p_i-1$ values.\n\nLet $N(p, k)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of order $k$.\n$N(p, k) = \\phi(k)$ if $k | (p-1)$ and $k>1$. For $k=1$ (the trivial character), there is 1 character, but it is not primitive for $p>1$. However, for a product of conductors, we need to consider the trivial character for some components. A character $\\chi_p$ is primitive if its conductor is exactly $p$. The trivial character has conductor 1. All non-trivial characters modulo a prime $p$ are primitive. So, for $k>1$, the number of primitive characters of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$.\n\nThe number of characters of each required order for each prime factor:\n*   $N(p, 1) = \\phi(1) = 1$ (This is the trivial character, not primitive mod p)\n*   $N(p, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n*   $N(p, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n*   $N(p, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\n### 5. Counting the Combinations\nLet the orders of the four primitive characters be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$, corresponding to conductors $(7, 13, 19, 31)$. We need $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$. This means the set of orders $\\{o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4\\}$ must contain an element divisible by 2 and an element divisible by 3. The orders can be 2, 3, or 6 (since they must be greater than 1 for the characters to be primitive).\n\nLet $S$ be the set of allowed orders for a primitive character, $S=\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nLet $n_i$ be the number of choices for the character $\\chi_{p_i}$ of order $o_i$.\n$n(o_i) = \\phi(o_i)$ for $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n$n(2)=1$, $n(3)=2$, $n(6)=2$.\n\nLet's enumerate the combinations of orders $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ from $S$ whose lcm is 6.\n*   **Total combinations of orders from S**: Each $o_i$ can be 2, 3, or 6. For each prime, there are $n(2)+n(3)+n(6) = 1+2+2 = 5$ possible primitive characters. So there are $5^4 = 625$ total combinations of such characters.\n\n*   **Combinations with lcm not equal to 6**:\n    *   The lcm is a divisor of 2 if all orders are 2. There is only one such character for each prime, so $1^4=1$ combination of characters.\n    *   The lcm is a divisor of 3 if all orders are 3. There are two such characters for each prime, so $2^4=16$ combinations of characters.\n\nThe number of characters whose order divides 6 is the total number of ways to choose characters of order 1, 2, 3, or 6 for each prime component, such that not all are of order 1. This approach is more complex. Let's stick to the above method.\n\nThe set of orders is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Let the orders be $(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31})$. For $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, each $\\chi_p$ must be a non-trivial character (i.e. primitive mod $p$). Thus their orders must be greater than 1.\n\nLet $C(k)$ be the number of choices for a primitive character of order dividing $k$.\n*   Number of characters with order dividing 6: For each prime $p_i$, the orders can be 2, 3, or 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$. Total number of combinations is $5^4 = 625$.\n*   Number of characters with order dividing 3: For each prime, the order can only be 3. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3)=2$. Total is $2^4=16$.\n*   Number of characters with order dividing 2: For each prime, the order can only be 2. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2)=1$. Total is $1^4=1$.\n\nThe number of characters with order exactly 6 is:\n(Number with order dividing 6) - (Number with order dividing 3) - (Number with order dividing 2)\n$= 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nLet's verify this using a different counting method.\nLet $A_2$ be the set of characters where all orders divide 2.\nLet $A_3$ be the set of characters where all orders divide 3.\nLet $A_6$ be the set of characters where all orders divide 6.\n\nWe want $|A_6| - |A_2 \\cup A_3| = |A_6| - (|A_2| + |A_3| - |A_2 \\cap A_3|)$.\n$|A_6|$: For each of the 4 primes, we can choose a character of order 1, 2, 3, or 6. The number of choices is $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+1+2+2=6$. Total characters with order dividing 6 is $6^4=1296$. We must exclude the case where all are trivial, so $1296-1=1295$.\n$|A_3|$: Orders can be 1 or 3. Choices: $\\phi(1)+\\phi(3)=1+2=3$. Total: $3^4=81$. Excluding all trivial: $81-1=80$.\n$|A_2|$: Orders can be 1 or 2. Choices: $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)=1+1=2$. Total: $2^4=16$. Excluding all trivial: $16-1=15$.\n$|A_1|=|A_2 \\cap A_3|$: Order must be 1. Only 1 choice. Excluding all trivial: $1-1=0$.\n\nNumber with exact order 6 = (order divides 6) - (order divides 3) - (order divides 2) + (order divides 1)\n$= (6^4-1) - (3^4-1) - (2^4-1) + (1^4-1)$\n$= 1295 - 80 - 15 + 0 = 1200$.\n\nFinal check of the logic.\nLet $N_k$ be the number of primitive characters with order $k$.\nLet $C_k$ be the set of primitive characters whose order divides $k$.\n$C_6 = \\bigcup_{o|6} N_o = N_1 \\cup N_2 \\cup N_3 \\cup N_6$. (disjoint union)\nThe number of characters for each prime whose order divides $k$ is $\\sum_{j|k, j>1} \\phi(j)$.\nNumber of characters whose order divides 6: For each prime, orders can be 2, 3, 6. Number of choices = $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$. Total $= 5^4 = 625$. This is $|C_6|$.\nNumber of characters whose order divides 3: Order must be 3. Number of choices = $\\phi(3)=2$. Total $= 2^4 = 16$. This is $|C_3| = |N_3|$.\nNumber of characters whose order divides 2: Order must be 2. Number of choices = $\\phi(2)=1$. Total $= 1^4 = 1$. This is $|C_2| = |N_2|$.\nThe characters counted in $C_2$ and $C_3$ are disjoint.\n$|C_6| = |N_2|+|N_3|+|N_6|$.\n$|N_6| = |C_6| - |N_2| - |N_3| = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer is 608.\n\nFinal check of reasoning:\nLet $S_k$ be the set of characters where the order of each component divides $k$.\n$|S_6|$: Order of each component can be 1, 2, 3, 6. Number of choices for each component: $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+1+2+2=6$. Total: $6^4$.\n$|S_3|$: Order of each component can be 1, 3. Choices: $\\phi(1)+\\phi(3)=3$. Total: $3^4$.\n$|S_2|$: Order of each component can be 1, 2. Choices: $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)=2$. Total: $2^4$.\n$|S_1|$: Order of each component is 1. Choices: $\\phi(1)=1$. Total: $1^4$.\n\nNumber of characters with order 6 = $|S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2| + |S_1|$\n$= 6^4 - 3^4 - 2^4 + 1^4 = 1296 - 81 - 16 + 1 = 1200$.\n\nWhich one is correct? The condition \"primitive\" for $\\chi$ with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ means that each component $\\chi_{p_i}$ must be primitive, which for a prime modulus means $\\chi_{p_i}$ must be non-trivial. So the order of each component must be greater than 1. The first calculation method correctly incorporates this by only considering component orders of 2, 3, and 6.\n\nSo the first method is correct.\n\n<<<608>>>"
