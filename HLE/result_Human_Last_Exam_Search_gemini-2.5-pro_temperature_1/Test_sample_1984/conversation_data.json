    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nEquilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$:\n$$\n-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$$\n-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are the roots of this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if solutions that start near $x^*$ tend to approach $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$. We can analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around each equilibrium point.\n\n1.  **Stability of $x = 0$**:\n    *   For $x < 0$ (e.g., $x = -1$), $f(x) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 1(4) = 4 > 0$. Since $x'(t) > 0$, the solution $x(t)$ increases towards 0.\n    *   For $x > 0$ and close to 0 (e.g., $x=0.5$), $f(x) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125 < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases towards 0.\n    Since solutions on both sides of $x=0$ move towards $x=0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\n\n2.  **Stability of $x = 1$**:\n    *   For $x < 1$ and close to 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(x) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ moves away from 1.\n    *   For $x > 1$ (e.g., $x=2$), $f(x) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ moves towards 1.\n    Since solutions on the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. The number of stable equilibria is $m=1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
