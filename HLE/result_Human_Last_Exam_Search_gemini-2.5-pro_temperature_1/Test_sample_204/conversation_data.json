    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, is a topological invariant that classifies maps from the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere. For a vector field `n(x,y,z)` in 3D space that is constant at infinity (e.g., `n -> (0,0,1)`), the space can be compactified to a 3-sphere, and the vector `n` can be seen as a map to the 2-sphere of unit vectors. The Hopf charge of such a field is an integer that describes how the preimages of points on the 2-sphere are linked in 3D space.\n\nThe Whitehead integral formula provides a method to calculate this charge. In the language of differential forms, the Hopf charge H is given by the integral `H = integral(alpha wedge d(alpha))`, where `d(alpha)` is the pullback of the area form of the 2-sphere. In vector calculus, this translates to an integral involving a vector potential. For a normalized vector field `n`, one can define an \"emergent magnetic field\" `B` whose curl is related to the field's topology. The Hopf charge is then calculated via the integral `H = -1/(4*pi^2) * integral(A . B dV)`, where `B = curl(A)`.\n\nHowever, the direct computation of this integral is often complicated by the fact that the vector potential `A` is not uniquely defined (it is subject to gauge transformations) and is necessarily singular for any field with a non-zero Hopf charge. A common result of choosing a simple but singular gauge for `A` is obtaining a vanishing integrand `A . B`, leading to the incorrect conclusion that the Hopf charge is zero.\n\nA more direct physical and structural method to determine the Hopf charge for configurations like the one given is to analyze its winding numbers. The given vector field is defined by:\n`nx = sin(G)cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G)sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis is a parametrization of a unit vector `n` using a polar angle `G` and an azimuthal angle `f`.\n\n1.  **Azimuthal Winding Number (n):** The angle `f` is given by `f = atan2(y,x)`. This is the standard azimuthal angle (`phi` in cylindrical coordinates). As one makes a full circle in the `(x,y)` plane around the z-axis, `f` changes by `2pi`. This corresponds to an azimuthal winding number, often denoted by `n`, which is `n=1`.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number (m):** The angle `G` is given by `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, where `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z*z)`.\n    *   At infinity (`x`, `y`, or `z` -> ∞), `r2` -> ∞, so `G` -> 0. This means `n` -> `(0,0,1)`. The field is uniformly oriented at infinity.\n    *   The value `G = PI` is reached when `r2 = 0`, which occurs on the circle defined by `z=0` and `x*x + y*y = 0.5`. On this circle, `n` -> `(0,0,-1)`.\n    *   If we consider a path that comes from `z = -infinity`, passes through the circle where `G=PI`, and continues to `z = +infinity`, the polar angle `G` sweeps from 0 to `PI` and back to 0. This full sweep in the polar direction corresponds to a poloidal winding number, `m=1`.\n\nFor hopfion configurations described by these two winding numbers, the Hopf charge `H` is given by their product `H = n * m`.\n\nIn this case, with `n=1` and `m=1`, the Hopf charge is:\n`H = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n<<<1>>>"
