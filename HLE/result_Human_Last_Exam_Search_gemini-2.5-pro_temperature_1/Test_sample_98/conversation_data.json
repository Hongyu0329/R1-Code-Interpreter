    "When an icosahedron tank that is standing on one of its faces is half-filled with water, the shape of the water's surface will be a hexagon.\n\nAn icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. When it stands on one of its faces, that triangular face is at the bottom, and there is a parallel triangular face at the top. The axis passing through the centers of these two faces is a 3-fold axis of symmetry.\n\nWhen the tank is half-full by volume, the water surface will be a flat, horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron. This plane is perpendicular to the 3-fold axis. The shape of the water's surface is therefore the shape of the cross-section of the icosahedron at its mid-height in this orientation.\n\nWhile various cross-sections of an icosahedron are possible depending on the slicing plane's orientation—including pentagons and decagons when sliced perpendicular to a 5-fold axis—the cross-section perpendicular to a 3-fold axis is a hexagon. This can be visualized by considering the arrangement of the icosahedron's vertices. There are three vertices forming the base, three at the top, and a \"belt\" of six vertices around the middle. The horizontal plane at half the icosahedron's height will intersect the six edges that connect the lower and upper halves of this \"belt,\" forming a regular hexagon.\n\nSome detailed analyses suggest the cross-section could be a more complex polygon like an irregular dodecagon (a 12-sided figure). This is because the cutting plane might intersect not just six, but twelve of the icosahedron's twenty faces. However, the more commonly cited and visualized cross-section for this specific orientation is a hexagon.\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
