    "An American in Paris (1951) is the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict the Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film's celebrated 17-minute closing ballet sequence features a lavish, stylized tour of Paris, with sets designed in the impressionistic style of French painters. One of the locations prominently featured in this dream ballet is the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is located.\n\nThe ballet sequence, choreographed by and starring Gene Kelly, uses elaborate backdrops to transport the viewer to iconic Parisian landmarks. Multiple sources confirm that the Place de la Concorde is one of the key settings in this artistic interpretation of the city. A model of the Place de la Concorde's fountain was created for the production, and still photographs from the set show Kelly on a soundstage designed to represent the famous square. The sequence itself begins with Gene Kelly's character daydreaming in one of the fountains of the Place de la Concorde.\n\nPrior to 1951, several Best Picture winners were set in Paris, including *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937). However, these earlier films were predominantly shot on studio backlots in the United States, and there is no evidence to suggest that they recreated or depicted the Place de la Concorde and its famous obelisk. For instance, *Casablanca* (1942), another Best Picture winner with a connection to a French-controlled city, was filmed almost entirely at Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California.\n\nTherefore, based on detailed accounts of its production and visual evidence from its iconic ballet sequence, *An American in Paris* stands as the first film to win the Academy's top honor that features a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
