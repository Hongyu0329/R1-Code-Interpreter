    "### Symmetry Group for Optimal Packing of 1135 Circles is C₁\n\nThe symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁ in Schoenflies notation. This indicates that the arrangement lacks any rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\nThe determination of the optimal packing of a large number of congruent circles within a larger circle is a complex computational problem. For many configurations, especially those with a large number of circles, the resulting arrangements often exhibit minimal or no symmetry.\n\nA comprehensive catalog of best-known packings, maintained by Eckard Specht, provides data on various numbers of circles. For the specific case of 1135 circles, the entry for the symmetry group is empty. According to the legend of this catalog, an empty symmetry group field signifies that the packing possesses C₁ symmetry, which is the trivial group containing only the identity operation.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
