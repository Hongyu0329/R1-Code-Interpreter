    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, with triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n    *   **Phosphorus Ylide:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. The structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where Ph is a phenyl group and the chloro-substituent is at the second position of its phenyl ring.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    The Wittig reaction is a method for synthesizing alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. The carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde is replaced by the carbon group of the phosphorus ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond and the very stable triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:**\n    The new double bond forms between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the carbon atom that was double-bonded to phosphorus in the ylide.\n\n    *   From pivalaldehyde: (CH₃)₃C-CH=\n    *   From the ylide: =CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄)\n\n    Combining these two fragments gives the alkene product: **(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)**.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry:**\n    The geometry of the resulting alkene is determined by the nature of the ylide.\n    *   **Non-stabilized ylides**, where the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus is attached to alkyl or hydrogen groups, typically yield the (Z)-alkene (cis isomer) as the major product.\n    *   **Stabilized ylides**, which have electron-withdrawing groups (like esters or ketones) attached to this carbon, generally produce the (E)-alkene (trans isomer).\n\n    In this case, the ylide `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄)` has an alkyl group (`-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄)`) attached to the ylidic carbon, classifying it as a **non-stabilized ylide**. Therefore, the reaction is expected to be Z-selective, favoring the formation of the cis isomer.\n\nThe final named product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
