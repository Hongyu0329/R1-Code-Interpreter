    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM), followed by quenching with an electrophile.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide: This is the aromatic substrate. It has two potential directing groups for metalation: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂).\n    *   sec-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi): This is a very strong organolithium base used to deprotonate an acidic proton on the aromatic ring. It is more basic than n-butyllithium.\n    *   Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA): This is a chelating agent that coordinates to the lithium ion, breaking down organolithium aggregates and increasing the basicity and reactivity of the sec-BuLi.\n    *   Tetrahydrofuran (THF): This is the solvent for the reaction.\n\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) is a more powerful directed metalation group (DMG) than the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂). The reaction proceeds via the coordination of the sec-BuLi to the oxygen atom of the amide group. This coordination brings the strong base close to the ortho-protons of the ring, significantly increasing their acidity. This is known as a complex-induced proximity effect.\n\n    The two positions ortho to the amide group are C2 and C6. The dimethylamino group at C3 also directs metalation to its ortho positions, C2 and C4. Since both groups direct to the C2 position, and it is the most activated site due to the stronger directing ability of the amide, the sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C2 position. This forms a new organolithium intermediate, N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n\n*   **Reactant:**\n    *   Methyl iodide (CH₃I): This is the electrophile.\n\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    The highly nucleophilic carbanion at the C2 position of the aryllithium intermediate attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. This displaces the iodide ion and forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n**Final Product**\n\nThe final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
