    "A \"self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice\" refers to a path on a square grid where each step is one unit in one of the four cardinal directions, and no point is visited more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" is often used interchangeably with \"square lattice\" in this context. The number of such walks of length *n* is denoted by a(n).\n\nThe problem of finding a general formula for a(n) is a long-standing open question in mathematics. However, the values of a(n) for small *n* have been calculated through various computational methods. This sequence of numbers is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the identifier A001411.\n\nThe initial values of a(n) are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   a(10) = 44100\n\nTherefore, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
