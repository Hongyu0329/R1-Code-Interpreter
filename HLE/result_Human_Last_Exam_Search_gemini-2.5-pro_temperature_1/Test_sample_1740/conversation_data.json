    "To date, the let-7 family in humans is understood to comprise a specific number of mature microRNAs (miRNAs) that are derived from a slightly larger number of precursor genes. While the exact count can vary slightly depending on whether one refers to the mature miRNAs or their genetic precursors, a clear consensus has emerged from scientific research.\n\nIn humans, there have been 10 mature members of the let-7 family identified. These are:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nThese 10 mature miRNAs are encoded by 12 or 13 precursor genes, which are located on different chromosomes. For instance, some of the mature miRNAs, like let-7a and let-7f, are produced from more than one precursor sequence. Some sources identify 11 or 12 members, which can cause slight discrepancies in the total count. However, the most frequently cited number of unique, mature let-7 family sequences is ten.\n\nThe let-7 family is highly conserved across many species and was one of the first families of microRNAs to be discovered. Its members are known to be key regulators of cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation, and their dysregulation has been linked to various cancers.\n\n<<<10>>>"
