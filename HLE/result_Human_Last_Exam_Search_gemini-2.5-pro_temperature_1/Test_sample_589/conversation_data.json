    "After a comprehensive search for a Hollywood feature film produced by a major studio in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car, no such scene could be definitively identified.\n\nWhile numerous films feature teenagers, bicycles, and scenes involving dares or confrontations with vehicles, the specific combination of a pink bicycle being ridden head-on towards a car in a game of \"chicken\" does not appear in the search results for well-known major studio productions.\n\nComing-of-age films such as *Now and Then* (1995) and the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's *It* feature prominent scenes with groups of young people riding bicycles, but none of the available descriptions or clips depict the precise scenario requested. The trope of \"playing chicken\" is present in cinematic history, notably in films like *Rebel Without a Cause*, but these scenes typically involve cars against other cars.\n\nSearches for this specific sequence in various teen, comedy, and drama films have not yielded a match. It is possible the scene exists in a less-known film, a made-for-television movie, or is a composite of scenes from different movies in the user's memory. However, based on the available information, there is no widely recognized Hollywood feature film from a major studio with this exact scene.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify a Hollywood feature film that matches the specific scene described.>>>"
