    "### Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling in ϕ⁴ Theory\n\nIn the framework of the $\\phi^4$ theory near four spatial dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as $u^*$, is determined through the renormalization group in the context of the epsilon expansion. This expansion is performed in terms of the small parameter $\\epsilon = 4 - d$, where $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe analysis reveals the existence of a non-trivial infrared fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, in addition to the trivial Gaussian fixed point. The behavior of the theory in the vicinity of this critical point is governed by the universal critical exponents, which can be calculated using the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\nThe calculation begins with the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant $u$, which describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale. For a $\\phi^4$ theory with the interaction term in the Lagrangian given by $\\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4$, the beta function to one-loop order is:\n\n$\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$\n\nThe fixed points of the theory are found by setting the beta function to zero, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$. This equation has two solutions: the Gaussian fixed point at $u^*=0$, and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nBy solving for the non-zero coupling, we find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling:\n\n$u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$\n\nIt is important to note that the numerical prefactor in this expression depends on the normalization conventions used for the coupling constant $u$. The result presented here corresponds to a common convention used in quantum field theory. Different conventions, particularly in statistical mechanics literature, may lead to a different numerical factor.\n\n<<<The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$ in the $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions is $u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$.>>>"
