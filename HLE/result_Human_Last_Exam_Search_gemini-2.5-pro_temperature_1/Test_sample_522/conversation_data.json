    "This is a logic puzzle. I need to find the transformation rule that maps the `Input` to the `Output` and then apply it to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided examples by representing the comma-separated strings as grids of characters.\n\n### Analysis of Example A\n\n*   `Input_A = '001111,121111,111111'`\n*   `Output_A = '201111,101111,111111'`\n\nLet's represent them as grids (using 0-based indexing for rows and columns):\n\n**Input_A Grid:**\n```\n0 0 1 1 1 1  (row 0)\n1 2 1 1 1 1  (row 1)\n1 1 1 1 1 1  (row 2)\n```\n\n**Output_A Grid:**\n```\n2 0 1 1 1 1  (row 0)\n1 0 1 1 1 1  (row 1)\n1 1 1 1 1 1  (row 2)\n```\n\nBy comparing the input and output grids, I can identify the changes:\n1.  The character '2' in the input is at position `(row=1, col=1)`. In the output, this position becomes '0'.\n2.  The character '0' in the input is at position `(row=0, col=0)`. In the output, this position becomes '2'.\n\n### Analysis of Example B\n\n*   `Input_B = '0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n*   `Output_B = '0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n\n**Input_B Grid:**\n```\n0000000000000\n1100000001000\n1111000011110  (row 2)\n1111002111111  (row 3)\n1111111111111\n```\n\n**Output_B Grid:**\n```\n0000000000000\n1100000001000\n1111000211110  (row 2)\n1111000111111  (row 3)\n1111111111111\n```\n\nLet's identify the changes:\n1.  The character '2' in the input is at position `(row=3, col=6)`. In the output, this position becomes '0'.\n2.  The character '0' in the input is at position `(row=2, col=7)`. In the output, this position becomes '2'.\n\n### Deriving the Transformation Rule\n\nLet's summarize the transformations of the '2' and the newly formed '2'.\nLet the position of the initial '2' be `(r, c)`.\nLet the position of the '0' that becomes a '2' be `(r', c')`.\n\n*   **In A:** The '2' is at `(1, 1)`. The new '2' appears at `(0, 0)`. The transformation is `(r, c) -> (r-1, c-1)`.\n*   **In B:** The '2' is at `(3, 6)`. The new '2' appears at `(2, 7)`. The transformation is `(r, c) -> (r-1, c+1)`.\n\nThe vertical component of the transformation is consistently `r-1`. The horizontal component changes. Let's see if it depends on the column index `c`.\n*   In A, `c=1` (odd), and the transformation is `c-1`.\n*   In B, `c=6` (even), and the transformation is `c+1`.\n\nThis leads to the following rule:\n1.  Locate the '2' at position `(r, c)`.\n2.  In the output, the character at `(r, c)` becomes '0'.\n3.  Determine the target position `(r', c')` for the new '2':\n    *   `r' = r - 1`\n    *   If `c` is odd, `c' = c - 1`.\n    *   If `c` is even, `c' = c + 1`.\n4.  The character at the target position `(r', c')` (which must be '0' in the input) becomes '2'.\n\n### Applying the Rule to Input_C\n\nNow, I will apply this rule to solve for `MISSING`.\n\n*   `Input_C = '000000,011120,111111'`\n\n**Input_C Grid:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0  (row 0)\n0 1 1 1 2 0  (row 1)\n1 1 1 1 1 1  (row 2)\n```\n\n1.  The '2' is located at `(r=1, c=4)`.\n2.  The character at `(1, 4)` will become '0'. The second row `011120` will be transformed into `011100`.\n3.  Let's find the target position `(r', c')`:\n    *   `r' = r - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n    *   The column index `c=4` is even, so `c' = c + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   The target position is `(0, 5)`.\n4.  The character at `(0, 5)` is '0', so it is a valid target. This character will become '2'. The first row `000000` will be transformed into `000002`.\n\nThe third row `111111` has no changes.\n\n**Constructing the Output_C Grid:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nConverting this grid back to the required string format gives:\n`000002,011100,111111`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
