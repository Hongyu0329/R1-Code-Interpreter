    "The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, can be determined using a procedure analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers. This involves systematically reducing the matrices using elementary row operations.\n\nThe given polynomial matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nTo find the GCRD, we can form a composite matrix by stacking P1 and P2, and then apply elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to its row-echelon form. The elementary operations allowed are:\n1.  Swapping any two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThe non-zero rows of the resulting row-echelon form will then constitute the rows of the GCRD.\n\nFollowing this procedure, the row reduction of the stacked matrix `[P1; P2]` yields a matrix whose non-zero rows are `[1, 0]` and `[0, -1]`. This gives a GCRD matrix of:\nG = [, [0, -1]]\n\nA key property of GCRDs is that they are unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. A unimodular matrix is a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant. The determinant of G is -1, which is a non-zero constant, confirming that G is unimodular.\n\nSince G is unimodular, we can multiply it by another unimodular matrix to obtain a simpler form. For instance, multiplying G by itself:\n[, [0, -1]] * [, [0, -1]] = [,] = I\n\nThe identity matrix, I, is also a unimodular matrix and is a valid GCRD. When the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is a unimodular matrix, the matrices are said to be right coprime.\n\n<<<The greatest common right divisor of the given matrices is the 2x2 identity matrix:\n[,\n]>>>"
