    "I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nBased on my research, the town of Bardejov, a free royal town in the 15th century, had a well-established administrative structure that included a town judge (richtár) and a town council. Historical records confirm the existence of the office of the town judge in Bardejov during this period. For instance, a dispute involving the judge and the town council of Bardejov was recorded in 1461.\n\nScholarly work, specifically the book \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by Mária Fedorčáková, is known to contain detailed lists of the town's judges. Research based on the town's extensive archives, which are remarkably well-preserved, indicates that during the 50-year span of the latter half of the 15th century, a limited number of individuals, only ten, held the position of judge, suggesting comprehensive records exist.\n\nDespite the high probability that the name of the judge for 1461 is documented within these historical records and academic publications, this specific information is not available in the online resources that could be accessed.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
