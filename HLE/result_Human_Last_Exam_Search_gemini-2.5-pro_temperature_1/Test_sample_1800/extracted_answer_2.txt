The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not the same for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). For the WGS reaction, optimal ratios vary from low (2.5 atomic % Ni) to mid-range (7-18 wt% Ni). For water splitting, particularly the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), higher nickel concentrations are favored, with optimal Ni/Ce ratios ranging from 1:2 to 4:1.
