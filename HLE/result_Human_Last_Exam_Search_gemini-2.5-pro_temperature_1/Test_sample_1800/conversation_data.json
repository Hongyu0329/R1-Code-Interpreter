    "Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles are indeed promising catalysts for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS), with the catalytic performance being highly dependent on the Ni/Ce ratio. However, a single ideal ratio that maximizes performance for both reactions does not exist, as the optimal composition is specific to each application.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is influenced by factors such as reaction temperature and the specific composition of the catalyst support. Research indicates that the optimal nickel content aims to achieve a balance between high activity, stability, and suppression of side reactions like methanation.\n\nSeveral studies have identified different optimal ratios:\n\n*   **Low to Mid-Range Nickel Concentration:** A study on Ni-doped CeO₂ aerogels found that a low atomic percentage of 2.5% Ni in CeO₂ is highly effective for the WGS reaction at 350°C, showing near-equilibrium conversion of CO without detectable methane formation. Another investigation pointed to an optimum of around **7% molar Ni** in La-doped ceria for the reverse WGS reaction, noting that higher concentrations (10% molar) gave similar results, while lower amounts (1% molar) led to faster deactivation.\n*   **Mid to High-Range Nickel Concentration:** Research on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts with varying nickel content from 5 to 12.5 wt% showed that samples with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni exhibited nearly identical and high CO conversion rates (around 95%) at 400°C. Furthermore, a catalyst with 15% NiO/CeO₂ was reported to have high activity and stability, attributed to a high number of oxygen vacancies and strong metal-support interaction. In a different study on CO₂ methanation, which has relevance to the reverse WGS, an 18 wt% Ni/CeO₂ catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity.\n*   **High Nickel Content in Mixed Oxides:** For Ni-W-Ce mixed oxide catalysts, a composition of Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂, which corresponds to a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 1:3.5, displayed the highest catalytic activity for the WGS reaction.\n\nThe variation in these findings highlights that the \"ideal\" ratio is contingent on the catalyst preparation method and the presence of other doping agents.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the context of water splitting, which involves two half-reactions—the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)—the optimal Ni/Ce ratio is also varied and appears to favor a higher nickel content compared to the WGS reaction.\n\n*   **High Nickel Ratios for OER:** A study systematically varying the Ni and Ce content in Ni<sub>y</sub>Ce<sub>100−y</sub>Oₓ electrocatalysts found that compositions of **Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ (a 3:1 Ni/Ce ratio) and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ (a 1:1 Ni/Ce ratio)** exhibited the highest activity for the OER. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst, in particular, demonstrated remarkable long-term stability for over 100 hours. The enhanced performance in these catalysts is linked to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies and larger electrochemical surface areas.\n*   **Optimal Ratios in Composite Catalysts:** For Ni₃N-CeO₂/NF composite catalysts, a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (or a Ni/Ce ratio of 1:2)** was found to be optimal for both HER and OER, showcasing significantly lower overpotentials compared to other ratios. Another study on Ni(OH)₂-CeO₂ suggested that a **Ni/Ce ratio of 4:1** was highly effective for the OER due to strong electronic interactions at the interface of the two materials.\n*   **Co-doping Effects:** In Ni and Fe co-doped ceria catalysts, a (10 + 10) mol% of Ni + Fe in CeO₂ showed superior HER and OER performance, indicating that the interplay between different dopants is also a critical factor.\n\nIn conclusion, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the target reaction. For the WGS reaction, optimal nickel concentrations can range from as low as 2.5 atomic % to around 15-18 wt%, depending on the specific catalyst design and reaction conditions. For water splitting, and particularly the OER, a significantly higher nickel content, with Ni/Ce ratios from 1:2 up to 3:1 and even 4:1, has been shown to maximize catalytic performance. Therefore, the selection of the Ni/Ce ratio must be tailored to the specific catalytic application.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not the same for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). For the WGS reaction, optimal ratios vary from low (2.5 atomic % Ni) to mid-range (7-18 wt% Ni). For water splitting, particularly the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), higher nickel concentrations are favored, with optimal Ni/Ce ratios ranging from 1:2 to 4:1.>>>"
