    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is **Midnight Cowboy**.\n\nIn the 1969 film, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the character of Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (played by Dustin Hoffman) is very ill. His friend Joe Buck (played by Jon Voight) decides to take him on a bus to Florida, a place Ratso has always dreamed of going.\n\nAs they are on the bus, Ratso's health is clearly failing. In a poignant moment that underscores their friendship and Ratso's vulnerability, he says, \"Thanks, Joe.\" This expression of gratitude is one of his final lucid moments before he dies on the bus, thus sealing his tragic fate. The scene is a pivotal and heartbreaking conclusion to his character's arc.\n\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"
