    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms. This is based on the structure of the original nanocar molecule designed by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University in 2005.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in the original organic molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms. To determine the number of fluorine atoms, one must first determine the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar.\n\nThe nanocar consists of two main parts: four spherical fullerene (C60) wheels and an H-shaped chassis made from a class of compounds called oligo(phenylene ethynylene)s. The C60 fullerene wheels are composed entirely of carbon atoms and have no hydrogen atoms attached.\n\nThe central chassis is where the hydrogen atoms are located. A detailed analysis of the chassis's chemical structure reveals the following:\n*   A central benzene ring that is substituted at four positions, leaving it with 2 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Four \"arms\" extending from this central ring. Each arm is composed of two benzene rings linked by triple carbon-carbon bonds (ethynylene groups). Each of these benzene rings has 4 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the chassis is calculated as follows:\n*   Hydrogens on the four arms: 4 arms × (4 hydrogens/ring × 2 rings/arm) = 32 hydrogens\n*   Hydrogens on the central ring: 2 hydrogens\n*   Total hydrogens: 32 + 2 = 34 hydrogens\n\nIn a perfluoronanocar, each of these 34 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by a fluorine atom. Thus, the molecule would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
