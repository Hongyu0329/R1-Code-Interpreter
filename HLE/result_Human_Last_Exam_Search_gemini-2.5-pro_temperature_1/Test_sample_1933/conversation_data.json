    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a class of functions is a measure of its complexity or expressive power. In the context of logic, the \"functions\" are the formulas with one free variable, and they classify elements of a model's domain. The VC dimension is the maximum size of a set of elements that can be \"shattered\" by the formulas in the logic.\n\nA set of elements $X$ is shattered by a logic if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi(x)$ in the logic that is true for all elements in $Y$ and false for all elements in $X \\setminus Y$.\n\n### Analysis of the Logic\n\nThe logic in question is $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, say $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$.\n\n1.  **Formulas as Classifiers**: We are interested in formulas $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable, $x$. These formulas define sets of elements in a given model $\\mathcal{M}$ for which the formula holds true.\n2.  **Structure of Formulas**: The allowed logical symbols are existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n    *   An atomic formula with the free variable $x$ is of the form $P_i(x)$.\n    *   Using conjunction, we can form formulas like $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n    *   Existential quantifiers can be used on other variables, for example, $\\exists y (P_2(y))$. Since there are no predicates relating multiple variables (like $R(x,y)$), a formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to a conjunction of two parts: a part containing only the free variable $x$, and a sentence part with no free variables. For example, $P_1(x) \\land \\exists y (P_2(y) \\land P_4(y))$.\n3.  **The Concept Class**: In any given model, the sentence part (e.g., $\\exists y (P_2(y) \\land P_4(y))$) is either true or false for the entire model.\n    *   If the sentence part is false, the entire formula is false, and it defines the empty set. The formula $\\bot$ also defines the empty set.\n    *   If the sentence part is true, the formula's truth value for an element `a` depends only on the part with the free variable $x$. This part is a conjunction of atomic predicates, such as $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. The formula $\\top$ defines the entire domain.\n\nTherefore, the sets of elements (concepts) that can be defined by this logic are precisely the sets formed by taking intersections of the base sets defined by the four unary predicates $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. This type of concept class is known as \"monotone monomials\".\n\n### VC Dimension of Monomials\n\nIt is a well-established result in computational learning theory that the VC dimension of the class of monotone monomials over $d$ variables is exactly $d$. In this problem, the 4 unary predicates act as the $d=4$ variables.\n\nHere is a sketch of the proof:\n\n**1. VC dimension is at least 4:**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a model and a set of 4 elements that can be shattered.\n*   Let the set of elements be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\n*   Define the extensions of the predicates $P_i$ on this set as follows: $P_i$ is true for $x_j$ if and only if $i \\neq j$. That is, $P_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$.\n*   Now, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can construct a formula that selects exactly $Y$. Let $I = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$. The formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ selects precisely the elements in $Y$.\n*   For example, to select just $\\{x_1\\}$, we set $Y=\\{x_1\\}$. Then $I=\\{2, 3, 4\\}$, and the formula is $P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$. This formula is true for $x_1$ but false for $x_2, x_3, x_4$.\n*   Since we can define a formula for every one of the $2^4=16$ subsets of $X$, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**2. VC dimension is at most 4:**\nIt can be shown that no set of 5 elements can be shattered by intersections of 4 base sets. This part of the proof relies on the fact that any 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional space are linearly dependent. This result holds regardless of the specific model.\n\nCombining these two points, the VC dimension of the concept class is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
