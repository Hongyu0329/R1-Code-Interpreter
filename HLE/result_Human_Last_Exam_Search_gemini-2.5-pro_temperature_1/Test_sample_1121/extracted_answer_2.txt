The number of non-Clifford gates required is algorithm-dependent. For a benchmark problem like factoring the number 21, approximately 14 T-gates are needed. This logical gate count remains the same for both a distance-3 and a distance-5 surface code. The primary difference is the physical resource overhead required to fault-tolerantly implement these gates, which is significantly higher for the distance-5 code operating at a 1% physical error rate to achieve a sufficiently low logical error rate.
