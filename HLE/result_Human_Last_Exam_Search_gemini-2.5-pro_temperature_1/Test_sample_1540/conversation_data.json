    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings. The most memory-efficient C program will minimize the amount of memory allocated for variables.\n\n### C Program Solution\n\nHere is a C program designed for memory efficiency to solve the problem.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // The problem states string lengths are from 1 to 100.\n    // We need 100 characters for the string plus one for the\n    // null terminator ('\\0'). Thus, an array size of 101 is required.\n    char s1[101];\n    char s2[101];\n\n    // Read both strings from the standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n    scanf(\"%s\", s2);\n\n    // To be memory-efficient, an 'unsigned char' is used for the loop counter.\n    // Since the maximum string length is 100, an unsigned char (0-255 range, 1 byte)\n    // is sufficient and smaller than a standard int (usually 4 bytes).\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Loop through the strings. Since they are guaranteed to be the same length,\n    // we only need to check for the end of one string.\n    while (s1[i]) {\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        char c1 = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char c2 = tolower(s2[i]);\n\n        if (c1 < c2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // First string is smaller, exit.\n        }\n        if (c1 > c2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Second string is smaller, exit.\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory usage for the variables in this program (`m`) is calculated by summing the size of each variable declared.\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: This array stores the first input string. Since a `char` in C is guaranteed to be 1 byte, this array occupies 101 bytes. The size is 101 to accommodate up to 100 characters plus the mandatory null-terminating character (`\\0`).\n2.  **`char s2[101];`**: Similarly, this array stores the second input string and also occupies 101 bytes.\n3.  **`unsigned char i;`**: This variable is used as a loop counter. An `unsigned char` uses 1 byte of memory and can hold values from 0 to 255, which is sufficient for indexing strings up to length 100. This is more memory-efficient than using a standard `int`, which typically occupies 4 bytes.\n4.  **`char c1;`, `char c2;`**: These variables are declared inside the `while` loop. Each occupies 1 byte. Modern compilers are efficient and may reuse stack space, but for a direct calculation of declared variables, we include their sizes.\n\nTotal memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\nm = `sizeof(s1)` + `sizeof(s2)` + `sizeof(i)` + `sizeof(c1)` + `sizeof(c2)`\nm = 101 + 101 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 205 bytes\n\nHowever, a slightly more optimized version of the code could perform the `tolower` conversion directly inside the `if` condition, removing the need for the `c1` and `c2` variables, further reducing memory.\n\n```c\n// Inside the while loop\nif (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])) { /* ... */ }\nif (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2[i])) { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nIn this most optimized form, the memory for `c1` and `c2` is not used. The memory calculation would be:\nm = `sizeof(s1)` + `sizeof(s2)` + `sizeof(i)`\nm = 101 + 101 + 1 = 203 bytes.\n\nThis represents the most memory-efficient variable allocation for this problem.\n\n<<<203>>>"
