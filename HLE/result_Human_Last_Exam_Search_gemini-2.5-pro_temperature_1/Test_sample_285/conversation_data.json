    "To determine the largest value of $p$ for which the function $I(a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to find the supremum of all $p$ such that the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da$ diverges. The divergence of this integral is determined by the decay rate of $|I(a)|$ as $|a| \\to \\infty$. The slowest decay rate will determine the critical value of $p$.\n\nThe function $I(a)$ is an oscillatory integral:\n$I(a) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i \\phi_a(x, y)} dxdy$, where the phase is a cubic polynomial $\\phi_a(x, y) = \\sum_{j=1}^9 a_j \\phi_j(x, y)$.\n\nThe decay rate of such an integral as the parameters $a_j$ become large is governed by the \"flattest\" point of the phase function. This is related to the theory of oscillatory integrals and the Fourier transform of measures on surfaces. The problem can be rephrased as finding the $L^p$ mapping properties of the Fourier transform of the measure supported on the surface $\\gamma(x,y) = (x, y, x^2, xy, y^2, x^3, x^2y, xy^2, y^3)$ for $(x,y) \\in^2$.\n\nThe behavior of the integral at infinity, $\\int_{|a|>R} |I(a)|^p da$, depends on the slowest possible decay rate of $I(a)$. The parameter space $\\mathbb{R}^9$ can be stratified into submanifolds where the decay rate is constant. We must find the submanifold that gives the most restrictive condition on $p$.\n\nLet $M$ be a $D$-dimensional submanifold (a stratum) in the parameter space $\\mathbb{R}^9$. If for $a \\in M$, the integral decays as $|a|^{-\\alpha}$, then the contribution to the $L^p$ integral from a neighborhood of this manifold behaves like $\\int^{\\infty} (r^{-\\alpha})^p r^{D-1} dr = \\int^{\\infty} r^{D-1-p\\alpha} dr$. This integral diverges if $D-1-p\\alpha \\ge -1$, which implies $p\\alpha \\le D$, or $p \\le D/\\alpha$. The largest $p$ for which $I \\notin L^p$ is the supremum of these values $D/\\alpha$ over all strata.\n\nLet's analyze the decay rate $\\alpha$ and dimension $D$ for different strata of the parameter space $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$.\n\n1.  **Generic Case:** For a generic $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$, the gradient of the phase $\\nabla \\phi_a$ does not vanish on $^2$. In this case, integration by parts shows that the integral decays quickly, for instance, like $|a_1|^{-1}$ or $|a_2|^{-1}$. This corresponds to a decay rate of $\\alpha=1$. The dimension of this stratum is $D=9$. This would give $p \\le 9/1 = 9$. However, this simple analysis is not sufficient. A more careful analysis using the Tomas-Stein restriction theorem framework is needed.\n\n2.  **Stationary, Non-degenerate Point:** The decay is slower if the phase has a stationary point, i.e., $\\nabla \\phi_a(x_0, y_0) = 0$. Let's analyze the stationary point at the origin $(0,0)$ for simplicity. This requires the coefficients of the linear terms to be zero.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_a}{\\partial x}(0,0) = a_1 = 0$\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_a}{\\partial y}(0,0) = a_2 = 0$\n    This defines a linear subspace $M_1$ of dimension $D = 9-2=7$. For a generic point in $M_1$, the stationary point at the origin is non-degenerate, meaning the Hessian matrix has a non-zero determinant: $\\det(H) = 4a_3a_5 - a_4^2 \\neq 0$. In this case, the method of stationary phase gives a decay rate of $\\alpha=1$. This leads to the condition $p \\le D/\\alpha = 7/1 = 7$.\n\n3.  **Degenerate Stationary Point (Rank-1 Hessian):** The decay can be even slower if the stationary point is degenerate. This occurs when $\\det(H) = 0$. Let's consider the stratum $M_2 = \\{a \\in M_1 \\mid 4a_3a_5 - a_4^2 = 0 \\}$. This adds one polynomial equation, so the dimension of this variety is $D = 7-1=6$. For a generic point in $M_2$, the quadratic part of the phase is a perfect square, which after a linear change of coordinates can be written as $u^2$. The phase becomes $\\phi(u,v) = u^2 + P_3(u,v)$, where $P_3$ is a cubic polynomial. The decay rate for such an integral is determined by the Newton polygon of the phase function, which has vertices at $(2,0)$ (from $u^2$) and, for a generic $P_3$, at $(0,3)$ (from a $v^3$ term). The decay exponent $\\alpha$ can be found using scaling arguments. It is given by $\\alpha = \\delta_1+\\delta_2$, where $2\\delta_1=1$ and $3\\delta_2=1$. Thus, $\\delta_1=1/2$, $\\delta_2=1/3$, and the decay rate is $\\alpha=1/2+1/3=5/6$.\n    For this stratum, we have $D=6$ and $\\alpha=5/6$. The condition for non-integrability is $p \\le D/\\alpha = 6 / (5/6) = 36/5 = 7.2$.\n\n4.  **Highly Degenerate Stationary Point (Hessian is zero):** We can consider the case where the stationary point at the origin is even more degenerate, meaning all second-order derivatives are zero. This requires $a_3=a_4=a_5=0$, in addition to $a_1=a_2=0$.\n    This defines a linear subspace $M_3$ of dimension $D = 9-5=4$. The phase function is purely cubic: $\\phi_a(x,y) = a_6x^3 + a_7x^2y + a_8xy^2 + a_9y^3$. For a generic homogeneous cubic polynomial, the integral decays with a rate $\\alpha = 2/3$.\n    For this stratum, we have $D=4$ and $\\alpha=2/3$. The condition becomes $p \\le D/\\alpha = 4 / (2/3) = 6$.\n\nComparing the conditions we found: $p \\le 7$, $p \\le 7.2$, and $p \\le 6$. The most stringent condition comes from the stratum of dimension 6, where the decay is $\\alpha=5/6$. This gives the bound $p \\le 7.2$. Any further degeneracies (e.g., special cubic forms on top of a degenerate quadratic) happen on submanifolds of smaller dimension, and analysis shows they lead to smaller critical values for $p$.\n\nThe largest value of $p$ for which $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is the supremum of these possible bounds. The maximum value we have found is $7.2$.\n\nFinal Answer is $36/5$.\n\n<<<36/5>>>"
