    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube when using the CFOP method, a minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\nWhen solving the last layer, the orientation of the top layer pieces is completed during the Orient Last Layer (OLL) step. For PLL, the goal is to permute these oriented pieces into their correct positions. Advanced cubers can recognize the specific PLL case by looking at only two adjacent faces of the cube, for example, the Front and Right faces.\n\nOn these two faces, there are a total of six non-top-facing stickers: three on the front face and three on the right face. However, not all six are necessary for unambiguous identification of the PLL case. It has been established that one of these stickers is redundant. This is because the identity of a corner piece can be fully determined by two of its stickers, and since the top-facing color is already solved, viewing two side stickers of a corner is sufficient.\n\nSeveral recognition systems, most notably the \"Straughan Recognition\" method, have demonstrated that a minimum of five stickers is sufficient to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases. For instance, the stickers on the UFL, UF, UFR, UR, and UBR pieces can be used to identify the case. This efficiency in recognition allows speedcubers to execute the correct algorithm without needing to look at all sides of the cube, thus saving valuable time.\n\n<<<5>>>"
