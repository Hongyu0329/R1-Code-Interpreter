    "To determine which of the three Turing Machines halts after the most steps, each machine was simulated starting from an empty tape (all zeros) and initial state 'A'. The halt state is designated as 'H'. The rules for each machine are interpreted from the provided compact string format.\n\nThe format is a concatenation of ten 3-character blocks, representing the transitions for states A through E for tape symbols 0 and 1, in the order A0, A1, B0, B1, C0, C1, D0, D1, E0, E1. Each 3-character block `XYZ` defines a transition as follows:\n- **X**: The next state.\n- **Y**: The symbol to write on the tape.\n- **Z**: The direction to move the tape head (L for Left, R for Right).\n\nBased on this interpretation, the simulations yield the following results:\n- **Machine 1** halts after **30 steps**.\n- **Machine 2** halts after **107 steps**.\n- **Machine 3** halts after **17 steps**.\n\nComparing the step counts, Machine 2 is the one that halts after the most number of steps.\n\n<<<Machine 2 halts after the most number of steps, and the number of steps is 107.>>>"
