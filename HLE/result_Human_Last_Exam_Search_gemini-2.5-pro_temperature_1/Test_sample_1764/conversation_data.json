    "It is possible for a finite ultrametric space to not have any isometric embeddings into a specific Banach space. Therefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can provide a concrete example:\n\n1.  **Define a finite ultrametric space (X, d):**\n    Let X be a set with three distinct points, X = {x₁, x₂, x₃}. Let the metric d be defined as follows:\n    *   d(xᵢ, xᵢ) = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3\n    *   d(xᵢ, xⱼ) = 1 for i ≠ j\n\n    This is an ultrametric space because it satisfies the strong triangle inequality, d(a, c) ≤ max{d(a, b), d(b, c)}, for any three points a, b, c in X. For any distinct points, the inequality becomes 1 ≤ max{1, 1}, which is true.\n\n2.  **Choose a Banach space B:**\n    Let B be the set of real numbers **R** with the standard norm (the absolute value). **R** is a one-dimensional Banach space.\n\n3.  **Show that there are no isometric embeddings from X into B:**\n    An isometric embedding would be a function f: X → **R** such that for any two points xᵢ, xⱼ in X, the distance between their images f(xᵢ) and f(xⱼ) is equal to d(xᵢ, xⱼ). This means we would need to find three points in **R**, let's call them a, b, and c, such that:\n    *   |a - b| = d(x₁, x₂) = 1\n    *   |b - c| = d(x₂, x₃) = 1\n    *   |a - c| = d(x₁, x₃) = 1\n\n    Let's assume such points exist and order them on the real line, for instance, a < b < c. The triangle inequality for real numbers states that |a - c| = |a - b| + |b - c|.\n    Substituting the required distances, we get:\n    1 = 1 + 1\n    1 = 2\n    This is a contradiction. The same contradiction arises for any other ordering of a, b, and c. Therefore, it is impossible to find three such points in **R**.\n\nSince we have found a finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B for which there are no isometric embeddings, the number of such embeddings is 0. As the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
