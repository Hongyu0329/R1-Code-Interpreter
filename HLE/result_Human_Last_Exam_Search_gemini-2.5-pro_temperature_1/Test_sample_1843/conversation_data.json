    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive Dirichlet characters with respect to the prime-power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nWe are looking for characters where this order is 6.\n\nThis requires two conditions to be met for the orders of the component characters, let's denote them by $d_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$:\n1.  For each $i$, $d_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5\\}$ must contain at least one order that is a multiple of 2 and at least one order that is a multiple of 3.\n\n### 4. Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime-power factor, whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4:** The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character, which has order 2. Since 2 divides 6, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9:** The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character is primitive if its conductor is 9. Characters induced from modulo 3 have conductors 1 or 3. These are the characters whose order divides $\\phi(3)=2$. The primitive characters are those whose orders do not divide 2, i.e., orders 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6. So, the total number of choices for $\\chi_2$ is $2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. Any non-principal character is primitive. The orders of these characters are the divisors of 6, excluding 1.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    All these orders divide 6. The total number of choices for $\\chi_3$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 10 (excluding 1), which are 2, 5, and 10. We only need orders that divide 6. The only such order is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = \\mathbf{1}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 12 (excluding 1), which are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We need orders that divide 6. These are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_5$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe have found the number of choices for each component character $\\chi_i$ such that its order $d_i$ divides 6. Let's find the total number of such tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$.\nTotal combinations = (choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_5$)\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that the lcm of the orders is exactly 6 for all these 100 combinations.\n*   **Multiple of 2:** The order of $\\chi_1$ must be 2. Thus, the lcm of the orders will always be a multiple of 2.\n*   **Multiple of 3:** The order of $\\chi_2$ must be either 3 or 6. In either case, it is a multiple of 3. Thus, the lcm of the orders will always be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm is always a multiple of 2 and 3, it is always a multiple of 6. As all individual orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Therefore, the lcm is exactly 6 for all 100 combinations.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
