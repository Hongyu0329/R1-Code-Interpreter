An optimal single-site catalyst for both polyolefin degradation and olefin polymerization consists of a Group IV metal (Zirconium or Hafnium) complexed with a Constrained Geometry Catalyst (CGC) ligand and supported on sulfated alumina (AlS). This system creates a highly electrophilic cationic active site. Zirconium offers higher activity in hydrogenolysis, while hafnium provides greater thermal stability and yields heavier alkane products. The CGC ligand ensures high activity and comonomer incorporation in polymerization, and its open structure facilitates the reverse degradation reaction. The sulfated alumina support is crucial for generating and stabilizing the active cationic species required for both catalytic cycles.
