    "### Conditions for FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Existence Final Answer\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the concept of a tripled fixed point in mathematics, specifically within the field of fixed-point theory. The existence of such a point for functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is guaranteed under certain conditions, primarily revolving around the properties of the functions and the metric spaces they operate on.\n\n**Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nAn element (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product of three partially ordered metric spaces X, Y, and Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThis concept was introduced by Deepa Karichery and Shaini Pulickakunnel in their 2017 paper, \"Generalized Form of Tripled Fixed Point Theorems in Partially Ordered Metric Spaces\".\n\n**Key Conditions for Existence**\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are detailed in theorems that rely on the functions having a mixed monotone property and satisfying certain contraction-type conditions.\n\nA crucial property is the **mixed monotone property** for the triplet of functions (F, G, H). This property is defined as follows:\n\n*   **F** is said to have the mixed monotone property if F(x, y, z) is monotone non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (x and z) and monotone non-increasing in its second argument (y).\n*   **G** is said to have the mixed monotone property if G(y, x, y) is monotone non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (y) and monotone non-increasing in its second argument (x).\n*   **H** is said to have the mixed monotone property if H(z, y, x) is monotone non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (z and x) and monotone non-increasing in its second argument (y).\n\nThe main theorem establishing the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is based on the following set of conditions:\n\nLet (X, ≤, d_X), (Y, ≤, d_Y), and (Z, ≤, d_Z) be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Let F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z be continuous functions having the mixed monotone property. An FGH-tripled fixed point exists if there are non-negative constants k, l, and m with k + l + m < 1 such that the following contractive condition holds for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w:\n\nd_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w)\nd_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ k * d_Y(y, v) + l * d_X(x, u) + m * d_Y(y, v)\nd_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d_Z(z, w) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_X(x, u)\n\nFurthermore, there must exist initial points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z such that:\n\nx₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\ny₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\nz₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nThe theorem can also be established for discontinuous functions if the spaces X, Y, and Z have the property that for any non-decreasing sequence that converges, the limit is an upper bound for the sequence, and for any non-increasing sequence that converges, the limit is a lower bound.\n\nIn essence, the conditions combine the algebraic structure of partial ordering with the topological structure of complete metric spaces and a contractive condition on the functions to ensure the convergence of iteratively constructed sequences to a fixed point."
