    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then analyze the flags of African nations based on the same principles.\n\n### 1. The Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nWhen a flag is viewed as a matrix, its rank is the number of linearly independent rows or columns in its design. The problem states that we should choose values for the colored regions to maximize this rank. The Danish flag, the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross.\n\nLet's model the flag as a matrix where different colors are assigned different numerical values. To maximize the rank, we assume the red color (R) and white color (W) have distinct non-zero values. The flag's design creates two distinct types of rows:\n1.  Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the white cross are composed entirely of the value for white: `[W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n2.  Rows that are part of the red field are composed of the value for red, interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross: `[R, R, ..., W, ..., R, R]`.\n\nThese two row patterns are linearly independent as long as R and W are different. One is a constant vector, and the other is not. No other row patterns exist in the flag's design. Therefore, the maximal linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### 2. Flags of African Nations with Rank 2\n\nWe now need to identify which African flags have a design that also results in a rank of 2. This typically occurs in flags with the following structures:\n\n*   **Striped flags with a central emblem:** A simple horizontal or vertical tricolor would have a rank of 1 (as all rows or columns are simple multiples of each other). However, adding a central emblem creates a new, distinct row/column pattern, raising the rank to 2.\n*   **Flags with a combination of vertical and horizontal divisions:** Flags with a design that divides the field both vertically and horizontally, such as a vertical stripe at the hoist with horizontal stripes on the fly, will have a rank of 2.\n*   **Flags with a solid field and a central emblem:** A solid colored flag has a rank of 1. Adding an emblem creates a second row pattern, making the rank 2.\n*   **Striped flags with a corner emblem (canton):** If the emblem is simple enough that it only introduces one additional linearly independent row pattern.\n\nConversely, flags with the following features typically have a rank different from 2:\n*   **Rank 1:** Simple horizontal or vertical stripes with no other symbols (e.g., Nigeria, Sierra Leone).\n*   **Rank 3 or higher:** Designs with diagonal lines, triangles at the hoist, or complex cantons, as these features create many different, linearly independent row patterns (e.g., Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa, Sudan).\n\nBased on a systematic analysis of the 54 flags of African nations, the following countries have flags with a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   **Algeria:** A vertical bisection with a central emblem that straddles the dividing line.\n*   **Angola:** A horizontal bisection with a central emblem.\n*   **Benin:** A vertical stripe at the hoist combined with two horizontal stripes.\n*   **Burkina Faso:** A horizontal bisection with a central star.\n*   **Cabo Verde:** A field with horizontal stripes and a non-overlapping circle of stars.\n*   **Cameroon:** A vertical tricolor with a central star.\n*   **Egypt:** A horizontal tricolor with a central emblem (the Eagle of Saladin).\n*   **Eswatini (Swaziland):** Horizontal stripes with a large central emblem (a shield and spears).\n*   **Ethiopia:** A horizontal tricolor with a central emblem.\n*   **Ghana:** A horizontal tricolor with a central star.\n*   **Guinea-Bissau:** A vertical stripe (with a star) at the hoist and two horizontal stripes.\n*   **Kenya:** Horizontal stripes with a large central emblem (a Maasai shield and spears).\n*   **Lesotho:** A horizontal tricolor with a central emblem (a mokorotlo).\n*   **Libya:** A horizontal tricolor with a central emblem (star and crescent).\n*   **Madagascar:** A vertical stripe at the hoist combined with two horizontal stripes.\n*   **Malawi:** A horizontal tricolor with an emblem (a rising sun) in the top stripe.\n*   **Mauritania:** A field with top and bottom stripes and a central emblem.\n*   **Niger:** A horizontal tricolor with a central circle.\n*   **Rwanda:** Horizontal stripes with an emblem (a sun) in the corner.\n*   **Senegal:** A vertical tricolor with a central star.\n*   **Somalia:** A solid-colored field with a central star.\n*   **Tunisia:** A solid-colored field with a central disk containing an emblem.\n*   **Uganda:** Horizontal stripes with a central disk containing an emblem.\n\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Egypt, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Tunisia, Uganda>>>"
