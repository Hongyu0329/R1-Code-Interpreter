    "### Zapotec Civilization Recorded the Earliest Known Date in the Americas\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is \"1 Earthquake,\" inscribed on Monument 3 at San José Mogote, a Zapotec site in Oaxaca, Mexico. This artifact dates to approximately 600–500 BCE.\n\nThe monument depicts a carved relief of a captive individual, believed to be a sacrificed war prisoner. Between the figure's legs are two glyphic signs that have been interpreted as his name, \"1 Earthquake,\" based on the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. While there is some scholarly debate regarding the precise dating of the monument, with some suggestions of a later date, it is widely considered to be the earliest confirmed example of writing with a calendrical date in the Americas.\n\nOther early writing systems in Mesoamerica include those of the Olmec and the Maya. The Olmec civilization is credited with the earliest evidence of writing in the Americas, found on the Cascajal Block, which is dated to around 900 BCE. However, the Cascajal Block's inscription is not universally accepted as containing a date, with interpretations ranging from a list of sacred objects to a trade ledger.\n\nAnother significant Olmec artifact is the San Andrés cylinder seal, dated to about 650 BCE. Some researchers have proposed that it bears the calendrical date \"3 Ajaw\". If this interpretation is correct, it would represent a very early recorded date. However, this reading is contested by other scholars who suggest the glyphs might be symbolic rather than calendrical.\n\nThe earliest recorded date from the Maya civilization is the \"7 Deer\" notation found on mural fragments at San Bartolo, Guatemala, which have been radiocarbon dated to between 300 and 200 BCE, making it more recent than the Zapotec inscription.\n\nTherefore, based on current archaeological evidence, the Zapotec glyph for \"1 Earthquake\" on Monument 3 stands as the earliest definitively recorded date in a pre-Columbian writing system in the Americas.\n\n<<<\"1 Earthquake\" by the Zapotec civilization (circa 600-500 BCE)>>>"
