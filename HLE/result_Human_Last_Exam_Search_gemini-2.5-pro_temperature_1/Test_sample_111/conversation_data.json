    "While Geoffrey Chaucer was a prominent figure in the English court, his exact whereabouts at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death on September 12, 1368, remain a subject of historical ambiguity. However, it is certain that he was not in England.\n\nIn 1368, Chaucer was engaged in diplomatic missions on the continent for King Edward III. Historical records and scholarly accounts indicate that he was traveling abroad on the king's service during this period. His travels in the late 1360s are known to have included France and possibly Italy.\n\nA chronological account of Chaucer's life suggests that he traveled to the continent, \"probably France,\" on the \"King's service\" in 1368. There is also speculation that he may have attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti in Milan, Italy, during that year. The following year, in 1369, he was on military service in France.\n\nAlthough it is clear that Chaucer was on the European mainland, no definitive record has surfaced to confirm his precise location on the day of Blanche of Lancaster's passing. Therefore, while he was certainly not in England, and Scotland is not mentioned in any relevant context, the specific country of his location remains unconfirmed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
