No, it is generally not possible to stabilize a localized soliton in a 3D Hamiltonian with only Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in a bulk material. The ground state of such a system is a periodic spin spiral, not a localized soliton. Additional factors like an external magnetic field, magnetic anisotropy, or geometric confinement are typically required for stabilization.
