    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are predators. Their diet primarily consists of small, soft-bodied insects, with a particular preference for aphids. The specific plant an aphid is on, such as a Totara, does not change the fact that the aphid itself is the food source.\n\nIn addition to preying on insects, adult snakeflies have also been recorded consuming other substances. Some adults are known to eat pollen, and it has been found in their guts. Furthermore, some species also feed on sugary substances, and adults can be found visiting nectar-producing flowers. There is no scientific record of them feeding on fungus or leaf tissue.\n\nBased on the available food sources:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Recorded as part of their diet.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While the specific plant isn't mentioned, pollen, in general, is a known food source.\n*   **C. Fungus:** Not a recorded food source.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Not a recorded food source.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Aphids are a well-documented primary food source.\n\nBoth Nectar (A) and Totara Aphids (E) have been recorded as food for adult Raphidiopterans.\n\n<<<F>>>"
