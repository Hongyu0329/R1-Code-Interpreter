    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is a topic of ongoing research in combinatorics. A cap set is a subset of points in an affine space over the field of 3 elements, AG(n,3), with no three points lying on a line. The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension *n* is denoted by r_3(n).\n\nThe exact values for the maximum size of cap sets are known for dimensions up to 6:\n*   r_3(1) = 2\n*   r_3(2) = 4\n*   r_3(3) = 9\n*   r_3(4) = 20\n*   r_3(5) = 45\n*   r_3(6) = 112\n\nA straightforward method to establish a lower bound for the size of a cap set in a higher dimension is to take the product of the sizes of caps in lower dimensions. For dimension 8, we can consider various products:\n*   r_3(4) * r_3(4) = 20 * 20 = 400\n*   r_3(3) * r_3(5) = 9 * 45 = 405\n*   r_3(2) * r_3(6) = 4 * 112 = 448\n\nThe best of these product constructions gives a lower bound of 448. Therefore, any value less than 448 can be eliminated from the answer choices. This rules out options A, B, D, and E.\n\nThe remaining options are C (512) and F (496). More advanced and specific constructions can yield better lower bounds than simple products. While the provided search results do not contain a direct citation for a cap set of size 496 in dimension 8, it is a plausible value for a constructed cap that improves upon the product bound. Recent research in 2024 has even established a new record of a 518-point cap set in dimension 8 using artificial intelligence methods. This indicates that the best-known human-constructed bound would be a value below 518. Given the provided options, 496 is the most likely candidate for the best-known lower bound from traditional combinatorial constructions that surpasses the simple product bound.\n\n<<<F>>>"
