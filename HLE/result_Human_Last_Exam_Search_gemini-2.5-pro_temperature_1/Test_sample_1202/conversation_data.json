    "When a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, several outcomes are possible. The most common fate is that one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene, a process called pseudogenization. However, for both copies to be retained and diverge in function, other mechanisms must be at play.\n\nThe main theories explaining the retention and divergence of duplicated genes are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n*   **Neofunctionalization** occurs when one copy of the gene maintains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. Natural selection then preserves this new gene.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or complex regulation controlling its expression in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy sustains mutations that degrade a portion of its original functions. As a result, the two genes lose complementary functions, meaning both copies become necessary to perform the complete set of tasks of the original ancestral gene.\n\nWhile both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely and common mechanism for the *initial* retention of duplicate genes. This is because it relies on more frequent, degenerative mutations that partition the original function, rather than the rarer evolution of a completely new beneficial function required by neofunctionalization. Subfunctionalization provides a passive route for preserving both gene copies, which in turn gives them the evolutionary time to potentially develop a new function later on (a process sometimes called neosubfunctionalization).\n\nConsidering the other options:\n*   **Gene conversion** is a process where one gene sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them more similar. This promotes homogenization and works against the divergence of duplicate genes.\n*   **Pseudogenization** is the most frequent outcome for a duplicated gene, but it represents the *loss* of a functional gene, not its retention and divergence.\n*   **Adaptive radiation** is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of species, not a molecular mechanism for retaining individual genes.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is the most probable mechanism among the choices for ensuring the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicated genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
