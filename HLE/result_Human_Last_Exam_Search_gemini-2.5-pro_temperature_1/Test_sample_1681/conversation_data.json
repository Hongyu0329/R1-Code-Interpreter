    "In the realm of quantum game theory, the classical Prisoner's Dilemma is transformed by introducing quantum phenomena such as entanglement. By placing the two players' fates in an entangled state, it's possible to alter the game's strategic landscape and its equilibrium points. For this problem, we utilize the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) quantization scheme.\n\nThe classical Prisoner's Dilemma with the given payoff matrix has a single Nash Equilibrium at (Defect, Defect) with a payoff of (1,1). However, the Pareto optimal outcome, where the total payoff is maximized, is at (Cooperate, Cooperate) with a payoff of (5,5). The dilemma arises because rational players will choose to defect, leading to a suboptimal outcome for both.\n\nIn the quantum version, the players' strategies are no longer simple choices but unitary operations on their respective qubits. The initial state of these qubits is entangled, and the degree of this entanglement is a crucial parameter, denoted by γ, where γ=0 represents a classical game and γ=π/2 represents maximal entanglement.\n\nAs the designer of the game's initial state for an optimal outcome, the goal is to establish a scenario where the Pareto optimal outcome of (5,5) becomes a stable Nash Equilibrium. This can be achieved by setting a specific level of entanglement.\n\nBy analyzing the payoff functions within the EWL scheme for the given payoff matrix, it can be shown that if the players are restricted to their classical strategies of Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), the (Cooperate, Cooperate) strategy profile becomes a Nash Equilibrium if the entanglement parameter γ satisfies the condition cos(γ) > 3/8 (or approximately γ < 1.186 radians).\n\nUnder this condition, if one player chooses to cooperate, the other player's payoff for also cooperating is greater than their payoff for defecting. Specifically, for a player whose opponent chooses 'Cooperate', their own payoff for cooperating is 5cos²(γ) + 1sin²(γ), while their payoff for defecting becomes 5sin²(γ/2). The inequality 5cos²(γ) + sin²(γ) > 5sin²(γ/2) holds true when cos(γ) > 0.375.\n\nThis means that mutual cooperation becomes a stable strategy, as neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their choice. For this range of entanglement, the classical dilemma is resolved, and the rational choice aligns with the mutually most beneficial outcome.\n\nTherefore, by designing the initial state with an appropriate level of entanglement, the equilibrium point of the game becomes the payoff associated with mutual cooperation.\n\nThe equilibrium point is (5,5).\n\n<<< (5,5) >>>"
