    "To determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we first need to understand the structure of this group and its power subgroups.\n\n### The Semidihedral Group\n\nThe semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted as $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which implies $n=9$. Thus, we are considering the group $SD_{512}$, with the presentation:\n$SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$, and $sr^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n### Power Subgroups\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ consists of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This is denoted as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form for $G = SD_{512}$.\n\nWe analyze the set of k-th powers, $G^k$, by considering two cases for the integer $k$.\n\n#### Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer\n\nThe set of k-th powers is $G^k = \\{ (r^i)^k \\} \\cup \\{ (sr^i)^k \\}$.\n\n*   For the elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, we have $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, the greatest common divisor of $k$ and the order of $r$ (which is 256) is 1, i.e., $\\gcd(k, 256) = 1$. As $i$ ranges from 0 to 255, the product $ik \\pmod{256}$ also covers all residues from 0 to 255. Therefore, the set of k-th powers of elements from $\\langle r \\rangle$ is the entire subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   The set $G^k$ also contains elements of the form $(sr^i)^k$. Since $k$ is odd, these elements are of the form $sr^j$ for some integer $j$. For instance, $(sr^i)^1 = sr^i$.\n\nSince $G^k$ contains the entire subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ (which is a maximal subgroup of $SD_{512}$) and at least one element not in $\\langle r \\rangle$, the subgroup generated by these elements must be the entire group $G$. Therefore, for any odd integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is the group $SD_{512}$ itself. This gives us **one** power subgroup.\n\n#### Case 2: $k$ is an even integer\n\nLet $k=2j$ for some integer $j$.\n\n*   The k-th powers of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$ are $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. This set generates the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n*   The k-th powers of elements of the form $sr^i$ are calculated as follows. First, note that $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i = s(s r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)})r^i = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1+1)} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$. For $n=9$, this is $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$.\n    Therefore, $(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^{2j} = ((sr^i)^2)^j = (r^{128i})^j = r^{128ij}$.\n    This set of elements generates the subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(128j, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\nThe power subgroup $G^k$ is the subgroup generated by the union of these two sets of powers: $G^k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)}, r^{\\gcd(128j, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\nWe can simplify the second generator term: $\\gcd(128j, 256) = 128 \\gcd(j, 2) = 128 \\gcd(k/2, 2)$.\nThe generator $\\gcd(k, 256)$ is a power of 2, say $2^a$ where $a \\ge 1$. The subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$ contains any subgroup of the form $\\langle r^{2^b} \\rangle$ where $b \\ge a$.\nThe second generator $r^{128 \\gcd(k/2, 2)}$ is either $r^{128}$ (if $k/2$ is odd) or $r^{256}=1$ (if $k/2$ is even). In both cases, this generator is already contained within $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$ since $\\gcd(k, 256)$ will be a power of 2 less than or equal to 128.\nThus, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\nWe now need to count the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way. Since $k$ is even, $\\gcd(k, 256)$ must be an even divisor of 256. The divisors of $256=2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^8$. The even divisors are $2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^8$.\nFor each $a \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 8\\}$, we can choose $k=2^a$, which gives $\\gcd(k, 256) = 2^a$. This results in the following distinct subgroups:\n1.  $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n2.  $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n3.  $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n4.  $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n5.  $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n6.  $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n7.  $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n8.  $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$\n\nThese are **eight** distinct power subgroups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining both cases, the total number of distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is the sum of the counts from the odd and even cases:\nTotal number of power subgroups = 1 (for odd $k$) + 8 (for even $k$) = 9.\n\nIn general, for a semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$, the number of power subgroups is $n$. For $SD_{512}$, we have $n=9$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
