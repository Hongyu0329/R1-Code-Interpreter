    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and yellow.\n\nPhosphorus has several allotropes, each with unique physical properties. The most common forms are white and red phosphorus. In addition to these, there are also black and violet allotropes.\n\nHere are the colors associated with the primary allotropes of phosphorus:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This allotrope is a waxy, transparent solid. When first produced, it is almost colorless. It can also appear as a white or yellow waxy solid. Because it turns a light-yellow color upon exposure to light and heat, it is often referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This form of phosphorus is dark red in color and can have an iron-grey luster. It can be created by heating white phosphorus.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope is formed when red phosphorus is heated at high temperatures. Its color is described as red/purple or violet.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** As the most stable allotrope, black phosphorus has a layered structure similar to graphite and is black and flaky in appearance. It exists in two forms, alpha-black and beta-black.\n\nTherefore, the observable colors in pure allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, violet, black, and yellow.\n\n<<<5>>>"
