**\( \Sigma' = (I - \frac{1}{2} [\hat{\delta}\times]) \Sigma_{\delta\delta} (I - \frac{1}{2} [\hat{\delta}\times])^T \)**, where \( \Sigma_{\delta\delta} \) is the part of the covariance matrix associated with the attitude deviation \( \delta \), and \( [\hat{\delta}\times] \) is the skew-symmetric matrix of the estimated attitude deviation \( \hat{\delta} \). If the state includes other variables, the full covariance is updated using a block-diagonal Jacobian matrix with this term for the attitude part and identity matrices for the other parts.
