It is possible for a fully functional MRI receive coil to show no resonance when tested with a magnetic loop antenna and a vector network analyzer (VNA) due to several factors related to the coil's design and testing environment. These include active or passive detuning circuits being engaged, the coil being a gradiometer which cancels the uniform field from the probe, effective RF shielding preventing magnetic coupling, the coil requiring a conductive load (phantom) to resonate correctly, or the complex interactions within a multi-channel coil array.
