    "### The Maximal Rank of the Tonga Flag Matrix is 2\n\nTo determine the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we must analyze the flag's design and how it translates into a matrix of values. The rank of a matrix is defined as the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns it contains.\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. Inside this white canton is a red couped cross. According to the problem, red pixels are assigned a value of *a*, and white pixels are assigned a value of *b*.\n\nLet's analyze the distinct types of rows that can appear in this matrix:\n\n1.  **Type 1: All-Red Rows.** These rows correspond to the parts of the flag that are entirely red. This includes the lower section of the flag below the canton, as well as the rows that intersect with the horizontal bar of the red cross within the canton. All of these rows will be identical, consisting entirely of the value *a*.\n\n2.  **Type 2: Canton Rows with White.** These rows correspond to the parts of the canton that are not part of the horizontal bar of the cross. A row of this type will be composed of the value *b* for the white sections and the value *a* for the pixels making up the vertical bar of the cross. For the remainder of the row (outside the canton), the pixels are all red, having the value *a*. Consequently, all rows of this second type are also identical to each other.\n\nSince the entire matrix is composed of only these two distinct types of rows, the rank of the matrix can be at most 2. The rank will be exactly 2 if these two row types are linearly independent, and 1 if they are linearly dependent.\n\nLinear dependence occurs if one row type is a scalar multiple of the other. This would only happen under specific conditions for the values of *a* and *b*. For example, if *a* = *b*, the entire flag is a single color, making the two row types identical and resulting in a rank of 1. Similarly, if *a* = 0, the all-red rows become zero vectors, and the rank would be 1 (assuming *b* is not zero).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the *maximal possible* rank. By choosing values for *a* and *b* that ensure the two row types are linearly independent (for instance, *a* = 1 and *b* = 0, or *a* = 2 and *b* = 1), we can achieve a rank of 2. No other row patterns exist in the flag's design that could introduce a third linearly independent row. Therefore, the highest possible rank is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
