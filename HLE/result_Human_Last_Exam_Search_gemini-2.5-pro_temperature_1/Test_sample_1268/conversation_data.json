    "I am unable to provide a definitive upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ for squarefree natural numbers $(N)$ because the notation \"$k_{k,\\infty}$\" is not standard and its meaning is ambiguous within the provided context.\n\nThe search results point to several advanced mathematical fields where \"maximum norm\" (often the supremum norm, $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$), \"covolume\", and \"squarefree numbers\" are relevant, primarily in algebraic number theory and the study of automorphic forms. However, without a precise definition of $k_{k,\\infty}$, it is impossible to establish a specific relationship with the covolume $V$.\n\nFor instance, if the question pertains to the geometry of numbers and lattices, a general relationship exists. For any lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with covolume $V$, Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies implies that the infinity norm of the shortest non-zero lattice vector, $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}$, is bounded by $\\lambda_{1, \\infty} \\le V^{1/n}$. The squarefree number $N$ would likely define the specific type of lattice under consideration, but further details are necessary to refine this bound.\n\nIf the context is the sup-norm of automorphic forms, where $N$ is the squarefree level, there are significant results and conjectures, but the notation provided does not directly match the standard notations used in that field.\n\nDue to this ambiguity, a specific formula or a numerical answer cannot be derived.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive answer due to the ambiguous notation of the 'maximum norm' as $(k_{k,\\infty})$.>>>"
