    "The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the continued fraction of the rational number 4/7 itself. This is because the primary way to define and compute a Markov number indexed by a rational \\( p/q \\), such as \\( m_{4/7} \\), is by first determining the continued fraction of \\( p/q \\). This continued fraction is then used in various algorithms, often involving matrix multiplications or combinatorial objects known as snake graphs, to calculate the integer value of the Markov number.\n\nThe computation of the continued fraction for 4/7 proceeds as follows:\nThe integer part of 4/7 is 0.\nThe remainder is 4/7. The reciprocal is 7/4.\nThe integer part of 7/4 is 1.\nThe remainder is 7/4 - 1 = 3/4. The reciprocal is 4/3.\nThe integer part of 4/3 is 1.\nThe remainder is 4/3 - 1 = 1/3. The reciprocal is 3.\nThe integer part of 3 is 3.\nThe remainder is 0, so the process terminates.\n\nThe resulting coefficients of the continued fraction are [0; 1, 1, 3].\n\n<<<[0; 1, 1, 3]>>>"
