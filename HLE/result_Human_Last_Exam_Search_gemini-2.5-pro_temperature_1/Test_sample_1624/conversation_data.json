    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this result:\n\n1.  **The space U is a separable metric space.**\n    The set $U$ is an open subset of the metric space $X$, so it is itself a metric space. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ means that $U$ is a topological n-manifold. Since $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a separable space, $U$ is a locally separable space. For a metric space, being locally separable is sufficient to imply that the space itself is separable. A metric space is separable if and only if it is second-countable.\n\n2.  **The space X is a separable metric space.**\n    Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $U$. Since $U$ is dense in $X$, it follows that $D$ is also a dense subset of $X$. To see this, let $x$ be any point in $X$ and let $V$ be any open neighborhood of $x$. Since $U$ is dense in $X$, the intersection $V \\cap U$ is a non-empty open set in $U$. Because $D$ is dense in $U$, this non-empty open set must contain a point from $D$. Therefore, $V \\cap D$ is non-empty, which proves that $D$ is dense in $X$. Since $X$ has a countable dense subset, $X$ is a separable metric space.\n\n3.  **The cardinality of a separable metric space.**\n    Any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This can be shown by considering the countable dense subset $D$. Each point in the space is the limit of a sequence of points in $D$. The set of all sequences in $D$ has cardinality $(\\aleph_0)^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. More formally, one can define an injective map from the space into the set of real-valued continuous functions on the space, or into the power set of the countable base, establishing that the cardinality is no more than $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n4.  **The impact of connectedness.**\n    The space $X$ is also given to be connected. A connected metric space with more than one point is always uncountable. For a connected separable metric space with more than one point, the cardinality is precisely $2^{\\aleph_0}$. If the space has only one point, its cardinality is 1.\n\nCombining these facts, the cardinality of $X$ is either 1 (in the trivial case) or $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Therefore, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
