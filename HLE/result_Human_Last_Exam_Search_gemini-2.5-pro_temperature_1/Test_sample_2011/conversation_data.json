    "The user is asking for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as *induced subgraphs* in a single graph on n=128 vertices.\n\nMy initial reasoning was as follows:\n1.  Let G be a graph on n=128 vertices.\n2.  Let S be the set of integers k such that there is an induced subgraph of G isomorphic to K_k (a complete graph on k vertices).\n3.  We want to find the maximum possible value of |S|.\n4.  Let ω(G) be the clique number of G, which is the size of the largest clique in G.\n5.  If G has a clique of size k, say C, then the subgraph induced by the vertices of C is a K_k.\n6.  Therefore, ω(G) is the size of the largest *induced* clique.\n7.  If a graph has an induced clique of size k (a K_k), then any subset of j vertices (for j < k) from that clique will form an induced K_j.\n8.  This means that if ω(G) is the size of the largest induced clique, then the set of all induced clique sizes is exactly {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}.\n9.  Therefore, the number of different induced clique sizes is ω(G).\n10. The problem is then to find the maximum possible value of ω(G) for a graph with n=128 vertices.\n11. The maximum clique size for any graph on n vertices is n.\n12. This maximum is achieved by the complete graph, K_n, which has a clique number of n.\n13. For n=128, the complete graph K_128 has a clique number of 128. It contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n14. Thus, the maximum number of different induced clique sizes is 128.\n\nThe search results bring up a related but different question about the number of sizes of *maximal* cliques. A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. An induced K_k is a clique of size k, but it might not be maximal. For example, in a K_4, the induced K_3 is not a maximal clique, because it is contained within the K_4. The only maximal clique in a K_n is the K_n itself. The question, however, is about *induced* cliques, not necessarily maximal ones.\n\nThe Wikipedia definition confirms my understanding: \"a clique of a graph G is an induced subgraph of G that is complete\". This directly equates a clique with a complete induced subgraph. It also distinguishes between a clique, a maximal clique, and a maximum clique.\n\nMy reasoning that if a K_k is an induced subgraph, then a K_j (for j < k) is also an induced subgraph is correct. This confirms that the set of inducible clique sizes is of the form {1, 2, ..., k_max}.\n\nTherefore, the problem is indeed to maximize the clique number, ω(G). For a graph with n=128 vertices, the maximum possible clique number is 128, which is achieved by the complete graph K_128. This graph contains induced subgraphs of every size from 1 to 128, so it has 128 different induced clique sizes. No graph can have more, as the clique size cannot exceed the number of vertices.\n\nMy initial logic stands and is supported by the definitions found in the search results. The distinction between \"clique\" and \"maximal clique\" is important, and the question uses the former, which makes the problem more straightforward than the one discussed in some of the search results concerning maximal clique sizes.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128. This is achieved by the complete graph K_128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
