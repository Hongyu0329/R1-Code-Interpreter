    "<<<S S S S S L S L L L S S L L S>>>\nThis is incorrect. A different approach is needed.\n\nThe line is an iambic senarius, the most common meter in Terentian dialogue. An iambic senarius consists of six iambic feet (S L), but substitutions are common. The key is to account for the syllables to fit the six-foot structure.\n\n1.  **Elision**: The final \"-e\" of `bene` is elided before the initial \"e-\" of `esse`.\n    *   \"et tibi bene esse...\" becomes \"et tibi ben' esse...\"\n\n2.  **Iambic Shortening (*Brevis Brevians*)**: In early Latin verse, a long syllable following a short syllable within a word or a close syntactical unit can be shortened. The word `esse` (L S) follows the short syllable of `ben'-`. This allows `esse` to be scanned as two short syllables (S S).\n    *   `ben' esse` (S L S) becomes `ben' esse` (S S S).\n\nWith these two conventions, the line can be scanned as follows:\n\n*   **Foot 1**: `et tibi` (S S S) - A tribrach, a valid substitution for an iamb.\n*   **Foot 2**: `ben' esse` (S S S) - Another tribrach, created by elision and iambic shortening.\n*   **Foot 3**: `soli` (L L) - A spondee, a common substitution.\n*   **Foot 4**: `quom sibi` (L S S) - A dactyl, a valid substitution.\n*   **Foot 5**: `sit` - This is not a complete foot. The scansion above is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the division. The caesura (a natural pause) often falls in the third foot. Let's try a more standard scansion that respects word boundaries better.\n\nLet's try this division:\n*   `et tibi bene` (`S S S S`) can be resolved into a single proceleusmatic foot, substituting for an iamb. This is a known, though less common, substitution. This leaves `esse soli quom sibi sit male` for the remaining five feet, which does not work.\n\nA more accepted scansion is:\n\n*   **Foot 1 & 2**: `et tibi bene esse` -> `S S S | S S S`. The first six short syllables are resolved into two tribrach feet. This relies on the elision of `bene esse` and the shortening of `esse`.\n*   **Foot 3**: `soli` (L L) - Spondee.\n*   **Foot 4**: `quom si-` (L S) - Trochee.\n*   **Foot 5**: `-bi sit` (S L) - Iamb.\n*   **Foot 6**: `male` (L S) - Trochee. The final syllable is anceps (can be long or short), so a trochee is permissible.\n\nThis provides a complete, if heavily substituted, iambic senarius.\n\n<<<S S S S S S L L L S S L L S>>>"
