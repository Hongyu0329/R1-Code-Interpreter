    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures by other scientists.\n\nMuch like his other groundbreaking papers published in his \"miracle year\" of 1905, the work on Brownian motion is notable for its lack of references to the contemporary literature. In the paper itself, Einstein mentions the possibility that the motion he is describing is identical to the \"so-called 'Brownian molecular motion',\" but he adds that the information available to him on the subject was too imprecise for him to form a definite opinion.\n\nWhile his later 1906 paper on the topic did cite experimental observations, the original 1905 publication stands on its own theoretical derivations. An English translation of the 1905 paper does contain a note suggesting that the reader should be familiar with the author's own previous papers on thermodynamics, indicating a degree of self-reference rather than a citation of external lectures or works.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
