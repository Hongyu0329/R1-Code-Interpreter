    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body with mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, which represent the gravitational field's strength, is a key aspect of this geometry.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric in standard coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$ is diagonal. This simplifies the calculation of the Christoffel symbols, as many will be zero. The non-zero components of the metric depend only on the radial coordinate $r$.\n\nDue to the symmetries of the Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), we only need to consider the unique combinations of indices. The non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{tr} = \\Gamma^t_{rt}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi\\theta}$\n\nBy counting these unique non-zero symbols, we find there are 9 distinct non-zero Christoffel symbols. Some sources might state there are 13 non-zero symbols if they count the symmetric pairs separately (e.g., $\\Gamma^t_{tr}$ and $\\Gamma^t_{rt}$ as two). However, the question asks for the number of non-zero symbols, and since $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$, these are not independent.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 unique non-zero Christoffel symbols in the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n<<<9>>>"
