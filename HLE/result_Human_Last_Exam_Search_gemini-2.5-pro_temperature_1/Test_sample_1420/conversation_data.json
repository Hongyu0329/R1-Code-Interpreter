    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 can be determined using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. The upper critical dimension for such a system, typically described by the O(N) model, is d_c = 4. The epsilon expansion is a perturbative approach where the critical exponents are calculated as a power series in ϵ = d_c - d.\n\nFor a spatial dimension of d=3, the expansion parameter is ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nThe critical exponent α, which characterizes the behavior of the specific heat near the critical point, is given to the first order in ϵ by the following formula for a general O(N) model, where N is the number of components of the order parameter:\n\nα = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * ϵ\n\nSubstituting ϵ = 1 for a three-dimensional system, we get:\n\nα = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8))\n\nThis expression for the specific heat exponent α depends on the value of N. For common physical systems, N takes integer values:\n*   **Ising model (N=1):** α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) = 3 / 18 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167\n*   **XY model (N=2):** α = (4 - 2) / (2 * (2 + 8)) = 2 / 20 = 1/10 = 0.1\n*   **Heisenberg model (N=3):** α = (4 - 3) / (2 * (3 + 8)) = 1 / 22 ≈ 0.045\n\nSince the specific model (the value of N) was not specified in the question, the general expression in terms of N is the most complete answer.\n\n<<<α = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8))>>>"
