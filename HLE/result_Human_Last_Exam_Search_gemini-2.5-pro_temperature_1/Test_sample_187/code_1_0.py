# The user wants to find errors in a Python file intended to be used with SageMath.
# The core of the problem is understanding how SageMath's preparser works (or doesn't work) on imported .py files.
# Specifically, operators like `^` and `/` behave differently in Python vs. the Sage preparsed environment.
#
# 1. `^` operator: In Python, `^` is bitwise XOR. In Sage (after preparsing), it's exponentiation.
#    Since the file is `triangle.py`, it is NOT preparsed. Therefore, `^` will be interpreted as XOR, which is incorrect for the mathematical formulas.
#    This affects lines 11, 29, 30, 31.
#
# 2. `/` operator: In Python 3, `/` is float division. In Sage, division of integers yields a rational number.
#    The `center_of_mass` method calculates `(int + int + int) / 3`. Since the operands are standard Python integers within a .py file,
#    this will result in a float (e.g., `1 / 3` becomes `0.333...`). This violates the "precise (non-floating point) arithmetic" specification.
#    This affects lines 22 and 23.
#
# Let's list the line numbers with errors based on this analysis.
#
# - Line 11: `sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])^2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])^2)`
#   Error: `^` is XOR, not exponentiation. Should be `**`.
#
# - Line 22: `x = (self.v1[0] + self.v2[0] + self.v3[0]) / 3`
#   Error: `/` is float division. The sum is a Python `int`. `int / int` will be a `float`. This violates the precision requirement.
#
# - Line 23: `y = (self.v1[1] + self.v2[1] + self.v3[1]) / 3`
#   Error: Same as line 22.
#
# - Line 29: `self._distance(self.v1, self.v2)^2,`
#   Error: `^` is XOR, not exponentiation. `_distance` returns a Sage object, but the `^` operator will still be the Python one. `sage_object ^ 2` would call the `__xor__` method. The intent is `**2`.
#
# - Line 30: `self._distance(self.v2, self.v3)^2,`
#   Error: Same as line 29.
#
# - Line 31: `self._distance(self.v3, self.v1)^2`
#   Error: Same as line 29.
#
# The ordered list of erroneous lines is [11, 22, 23, 29, 30, 31].
# No external information is needed, so a search is not required.
# I can proceed to the final answer.
