    "The search results confirm that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy is given by the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$. For a group of type $E_8$, the Weyl group is denoted by $W(E_8)$.\n\nA search result from MIT Mathematics explicitly states the number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl group of type $E_8$. It says, \"cl(W) has been described by Carter (1972); â™¯cl(W) = 112\". Here, \"cl(W)\" denotes the set of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\nThe number of these conjugacy classes is independent of the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ as long as the group is of the split type over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is the standard assumption unless specified otherwise. For any split reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group.\n\nThe Weyl group for $E_8$ is a specific finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed to be 112.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is 112.\n<<<112>>>"
