Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with Interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a significantly enhanced and more sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting the generation of a less differentiated, more persistent, and functionally potent memory T cell phenotype.
