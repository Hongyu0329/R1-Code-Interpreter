    "The lowest of the three notes the first violin ends on in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\" is B-flat.\n\nThe final musical phrase for the first violin section consists of an ascending arpeggio followed by a sustained note. The notes in this concluding passage are B-flat, D, and F. Of these three, B-flat is the lowest. This is found by examining the full orchestral score of the symphony's final movement.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
