In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k that is an inverse linear relationship in the denominator. Specifically, in the frequency-momentum domain, the Green's function is proportional to (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ)⁻¹, where ħω is the energy and iδ is an infinitesimal imaginary term to ensure causality.
