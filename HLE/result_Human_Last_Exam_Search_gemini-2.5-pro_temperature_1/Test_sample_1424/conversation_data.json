    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function (or free propagator), G_0, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is most clearly seen in the energy-momentum representation.\n\nThe two-point Green's function is generally defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. In the path integral formalism, this is calculated using a functional integral over field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the action. For the *bare* Green's function, G_0, one uses the free action, S_0, which corresponds to a non-interacting Hamiltonian, H_0.\n\nThe operator for the energy-dependent Green's function is the inverse of the operator (E - Ĥ), where E is an energy parameter. For the non-interacting case, this is G_0(E) = (E - H_0)⁻¹. By expressing this in the basis of eigenstates |k⟩ of the free Hamiltonian H_0, which have energy eigenvalues ϵ_k, the matrix elements of the Green's function are:\n\n⟨k'| G_0(E) |k⟩ = ⟨k'| (E - H_0)⁻¹ |k⟩ = δ_kk' * (E - ϵ_k)⁻¹\n\nTo obtain the time-dependent Green's function used in the path integral formalism, one must perform a Fourier transform from the energy domain (E) to the time domain. The inclusion of time-ordering in the definition of the Green's function leads to a specific prescription for handling the poles at E = ϵ_k. This is the Feynman prescription, which involves adding an infinitesimal imaginary part to the denominator.\n\nAfter Fourier transforming from time to frequency (ω), the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum representation, G_0(k, ω), takes the following form:\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **ħω** is the energy variable corresponding to the Fourier transform from time.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with quantum number(s) k (e.g., momentum).\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal imaginary term (with δ → 0⁺) that enforces the correct time-ordering (causality) for the propagator. The sign of this term can depend on whether the state k is occupied or unoccupied, but the fundamental dependence on ϵ_k remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is an **inverse linear relationship in the denominator**. The single-particle energy ϵ_k determines the location of the pole of the propagator in the complex frequency plane.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k that is an inverse linear relationship in the denominator. Specifically, in the frequency-momentum domain, the Green's function is proportional to (ħω - ϵ_k + iδ)⁻¹, where ħω is the energy and iδ is an infinitesimal imaginary term to ensure causality.>>>"
