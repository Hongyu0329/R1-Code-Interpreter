    "The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the specific atom. The notation \"6-311G**\" can be broken down to understand how the basis set is constructed for each atom. This notation is equivalent to 6-311G(d,p).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the number of primitive Gaussians for hydrogen and a first-row heavy atom like carbon:\n\n**For a Hydrogen atom:**\n\n*   **6-311G**: The valence s-orbital is described by three functions. The first is a contraction of three primitive Gaussians, and the next two are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians. So, this part contributes 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive s-type Gaussians.\n*   **\\*\\***: The second asterisk indicates the addition of polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. For hydrogen, this is a set of p-type functions (p_x, p_y, p_z). This adds one primitive p-type Gaussian for each of the three p-orbitals, so 3 primitive p-type Gaussians.\n\nTherefore, a hydrogen atom is described by a total of 5 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n**For a first-row heavy atom (e.g., Carbon):**\n\n*   **6-311G**:\n    *   **Core (1s orbital)**: The \"6\" signifies that the core 1s orbital is represented by a contraction of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals)**: The \"311\" indicates the valence shell is split into three parts. The first is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the next two are single uncontracted primitives. This applies to both the 2s and the three 2p orbitals (2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z).\n        *   For the s-orbitals (1s and 2s): 6 (from 1s) + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11 primitive s-type Gaussians.\n        *   For the p-orbitals (2p): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive p-type Gaussians.\n*   **\\*\\***: The first asterisk adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy atoms. In the context of Pople basis sets like 6-311G**, this typically refers to a set of 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), although some programs may use 5 spherical d-functions. Assuming the standard 6 Cartesian d-functions, this adds 6 primitive d-type Gaussians.\n\nTherefore, a first-row heavy atom like carbon is described by a total of 11 (s-type) + 5 (p-type) + 6 (d-type) = **22 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you would sum the number of primitives for each atom in the molecule. For example, for methane (CH4), the total number would be 22 (for Carbon) + 4 * 8 (for the four Hydrogens) = 54 primitive Gaussians. For methanol (CH3OH), an example with 94 primitive Gaussians is mentioned.\n\n<<<A hydrogen atom has 8 primitive Gaussians, and a first-row heavy atom (like Carbon or Oxygen) has 22 primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.>>>"
