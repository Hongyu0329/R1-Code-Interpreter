    "Given the definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB) and the constraint that our only epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" two significant problems arise that are not Gettier problems.\n\n<<<**1. The Infinite Regress of Justification**\n\nThe JTB model requires that a belief be justified to qualify as knowledge. The problem emerges when we question what underpins the justification itself. In a system restricted to only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" one must ask if the justification for a belief must also be *known* to be valid, or merely *believed* to be so.\n\nIf a person must *know* their justification is good, this leads to an infinite regress. To know the original proposition, one would need to have a justified true belief about the validity of their justification. This, in turn, would require another justification for that justification, and so on, making knowledge impossible to achieve as it would require performing an infinite number of tasks.\n\nAlternatively, if a person only needs to *believe* their justification is valid, the foundation for their knowledge becomes weak and subjective. This undermines the role of justification, which is to ensure the belief is not true simply by accident.\n\n**2. The Inaccessibility of Truth and Epistemic Luck**\n\nThe \"Truth\" condition of the JTB theory is objective and external to the individual's mind. The \"Belief\" state, however, is internal and subjective. The problem lies in the gap between these two and the agent's inability to distinguish a true belief from a false one from their own perspective.\n\nWithin the constrained binary system of \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" a person can have a belief that happens to be true but lacks justification. From their internal viewpoint, this state is simply \"Belief,\" indistinguishable from a \"Belief\" that is false. This situation is a form of **epistemic luck**, where a belief is true by chance without the believer having a reliable way to confirm it. While the justification condition in the JTB analysis is meant to prevent a lucky guess from counting as knowledge, this problem highlights a more fundamental luck: having a belief that is true without being able to internally recognize it as such. The agent has no epistemic tools to access the \"Truth\" of their belief; they are entirely reliant on the justification component, which, as established in the first problem, is itself on precarious grounds.>>>"
