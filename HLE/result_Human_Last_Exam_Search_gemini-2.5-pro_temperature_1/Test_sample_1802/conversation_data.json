    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a $d$-dimensional qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is described by the following operation on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k X_k \\rho X_k^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$), and $\\{X_k\\}$ is a basis of generalized Pauli operators. These $d^2$ operators are unitary and form a basis for the vector space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $E_k = \\sqrt{p_k} X_k$.\n\n2.  **Rank of a Quantum Channel:** The rank of a quantum channel, often referred to as the Choi rank, is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi rank is equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to describe the channel (the Kraus rank).\n\n3.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel:** A fundamental result in quantum information theory is that the rank of a quantum channel is equal to the rank of its complementary channel. Therefore, to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, we can find the maximal rank of the original Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Rank of the Pauli Channel:** The rank of the channel $\\Lambda$ is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators in its minimal representation. The Kraus operators are $E_k = \\sqrt{p_k} X_k$. Since the generalized Pauli operators $\\{X_k\\}$ form a basis, they are linearly independent.\n\n5.  **Maximizing the Rank:** To maximize the rank, we need to have the maximum number of non-zero Kraus operators. This is achieved when all the probabilities $p_k$ are greater than zero ($p_k > 0$ for all $k=0, \\dots, d^2-1$). A common example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k$. In this case, there are $d^2$ linearly independent Kraus operators.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** When all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero, the rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$. Since the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is equal to the rank of $\\Lambda$, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is also $d^2$. For instance, the Choi matrix of a depolarizing channel has a rank of $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
