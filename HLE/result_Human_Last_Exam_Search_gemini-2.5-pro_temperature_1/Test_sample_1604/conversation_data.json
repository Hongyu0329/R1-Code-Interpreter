    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Charge at Huj**, which took place on November 8, 1917. This event was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War.\n\nElizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, was a renowned British painter who specialized in military scenes. While she painted numerous battles from various conflicts, her works depicting World War I are among the latest chronologically. Her paintings of this era include:\n\n*   ***The Royal Horse Guards Retreat from Mons, 1914***: Depicting events from the Great Retreat in August and September of 1914.\n*   ***The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916***: Illustrating a cavalry charge during the Senussi Campaign in Egypt.\n*   ***A London Irish at Loos*** (1916): Showing an assault during the Battle of Loos.\n*   ***The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj***: This painting captures a cavalry charge on November 8, 1917.\n*   ***A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders***: Her last known oil painting on a military subject, completed in 1929.\n\nWhile *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders* was completed later, the specific historical event it portrays is not as precisely dated as the Charge at Huj. Therefore, the Battle of Huj is the latest identifiable historical battle depicted in her work.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj>>>"
