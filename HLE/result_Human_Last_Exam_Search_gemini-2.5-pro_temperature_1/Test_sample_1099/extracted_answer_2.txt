In summary, the minimal resources necessary to simulate the correlations from POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state with a local hidden variable model are:
*   **Shared Randomness:** A finite set of shared random variables (the Local Hidden Variable).
*   **Classical Communication:** An average of **one bit of communication** from one party to the other.
*   **Non-signaling PR-Box:** This is **not a necessary resource**. The correlations of a singlet state are strictly weaker than those of a PR-box.
