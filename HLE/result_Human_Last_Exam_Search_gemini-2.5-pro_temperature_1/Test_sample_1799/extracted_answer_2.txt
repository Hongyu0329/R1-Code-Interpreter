It is not true that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first postulate alone. While the first postulate is a necessary component, it does not by itself lead to the conclusion that the speed of light is constant for all inertial observers. Additional assumptions about the homogeneity and isotropy of space and time, or the inclusion of Maxwell's equations as a fundamental law of physics, are required to arrive at a conclusion similar to the second postulate. Therefore, in the standard formulation of special relativity, the second postulate is considered an independent and essential principle.
