    "Three distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\nThe knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). To obtain an element of the homology cobordism group, which consists of homology 3-spheres, one must perform an integral surgery with a coefficient of +1 or -1.\n\nHere is an analysis of the surgeries on these knots:\n*   **Unknot (0₁):** Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot yield the 3-sphere (S³). The 3-sphere represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n*   **Trefoil Knot (3₁):**\n    *   The +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot results in the Poincaré homology sphere. This manifold has a non-trivial Rochlin invariant, which means it is not homology cobordant to the 3-sphere and represents a distinct element of infinite order.\n    *   The -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot produces the mirror image of the Poincaré homology sphere. This represents the inverse of the element generated by the +1 surgery and is also a distinct element.\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** The figure-eight knot is a slice knot. A +1 or -1 surgery on any slice knot results in a homology sphere that is homology cobordant to S³. Therefore, surgery on the figure-eight knot yields the identity element in the homology cobordism group. The figure-eight knot is also amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image, so +1 and -1 surgeries produce the same homology sphere.\n\nCounting the distinct elements, we have:\n1.  The identity element (from the unknot and the figure-eight knot).\n2.  The element represented by the Poincaré homology sphere (from +1 surgery on the trefoil).\n3.  The inverse element (from -1 surgery on the trefoil).\n\nThese three elements are distinct, bringing the total count to three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
