    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law.\n\nThis law, enacted in 1973, marked a significant development in Israeli jurisprudence by formally codifying the principle of \"good faith\" (known in Hebrew as *tom lev* and *derekh mekubbelet*). Specifically, Section 12 of the law mandates that parties to a negotiation for a contract must act in good faith, while Section 39 requires that any right or obligation arising from a contract be exercised and fulfilled in good faith.\n\nPrior to the enactment of the Contracts (General Part) Law, Israeli contract law was largely based on English common law, which did not have a generalized, explicit principle of good faith. The introduction of this concept was a move towards civil law traditions, particularly influenced by German law. This statute has had a profound impact on Israeli contract law, extending the duty of good faith to all legal actions, not just contracts.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
