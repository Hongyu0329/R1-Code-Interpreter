    "In the 2015 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, prima ballerina Svetlana Zakharova performs **six** sissonne fermes during the Act II Odette variation.\n\nThis count is based on analysis of the widely available high-definition recording of the performance from January 2015, which is often cited as the definitive version of Zakharova in this role with the Bolshoi. While the user inquired about a 2014 production, the most prominent and accessible recording of Zakharova in Grigorovich's *Swan Lake* is from 2015. The choreography for this specific production, however, is consistent.\n\nThe Odette variation in Act II of Grigorovich's staging is a signature piece of the ballet. A video compilation of famous Bolshoi ballerinas performing the role of Odette includes Zakharova's 2015 interpretation, and a full version of Act II from the same performance is also available online, both of which were used to verify the count.\n\n<<<6>>>"
