    "To determine the coordinates of the central pixel for a line between (1, 1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, the following steps are taken:\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in x (dx) and the change in y (dy):\n*   dx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   dy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nThe initial decision parameter is calculated as:\n*   p = 2 * dy - dx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\nSince the slope is less than 1, we will always increment x by 1 and increment y only when the decision parameter is non-negative.\n\nThe pixels generated by the algorithm are:\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   **(6, 3)**\n*   (7, 3)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 4)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels that form the line. The central pixel is the 6th one in this sequence.\n\n<<<The coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).>>>"
