This approach is not valid for drawing conclusions about the ecological function of the mimicry syndromes. The primary selective agents for bumblebee mimicry are avian predators, whose visual systems are fundamentally different from humans, particularly in their ability to see ultraviolet light and perceive finer color gradations. Because the function of mimicry is entirely dependent on the predator's perception, using human observers provides an anthropocentric and likely inaccurate grouping that may not reflect the real, functional mimicry rings in nature.
