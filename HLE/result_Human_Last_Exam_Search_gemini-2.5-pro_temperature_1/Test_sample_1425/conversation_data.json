    "<<<In the grand canonical ensemble, the system can exchange both energy and particles with a reservoir at a fixed temperature T and chemical potential μ. The partition function, Z, is a fundamental quantity that describes the statistical properties of the system.\n\n### Operator Formalism\n\nIn the language of quantum statistical mechanics, the grand canonical partition function is defined as the trace (Tr) over all possible states of the system, including states with different particle numbers:\n\nZ = Tr[e<sup>-β(Ĥ - μN̂)</sup>]\n\nHere:\n*   **Ĥ** is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   **N̂** is the particle number operator.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential.\n*   **β** is the inverse temperature, defined as β = 1/(k<sub>B</sub>T), where k<sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   The operator **Ĥ - μN̂** is often referred to as the grand canonical Hamiltonian.\n\nFor the specific case given, the Hamiltonian is Ĥ = -μN̂. Substituting this into the general formula for the partition function, we get:\n\nZ = Tr[e<sup>-β(-μN̂ - μN̂)</sup>] = Tr[e<sup>-β(-2μN̂)</sup>] = Tr[e<sup>2βμN̂</sup>]\n\n### Path Integral Formalism\n\nTo express this partition function using path integrals, we transition from the operator formalism to a functional integral over fields. The partition function Z is written as an integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action (S<sub>E</sub>).\n\nZ = ∫D[φ*, φ] e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[φ*, φ]</sup>\n\nThe Euclidean action for a system of quantum fields (φ) in the grand canonical ensemble is generally given by:\n\nS<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ φ*(∂/∂τ)φ + H(φ*, φ) - μφ*φ ]\n\nWhere:\n*   **τ** is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β.\n*   **x** represents the spatial coordinates over a d-dimensional space.\n*   **φ*** and **φ** are the complex conjugate fields. The integral ∫D[φ*, φ] represents an integration over all possible configurations of these fields, subject to appropriate boundary conditions in imaginary time (periodic for bosons, anti-periodic for fermions).\n*   **H(φ*, φ)** is the Hamiltonian density expressed in terms of the fields.\n\nFor the given system, the Hamiltonian is H = -μN. In the language of second quantization, the number operator N̂ is represented by the integral of the number density, N̂ = ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x φ*(x)φ(x). Therefore, the Hamiltonian density is:\n\nH(φ*, φ) = -μφ*φ\n\nNow, we substitute this specific Hamiltonian density into the general expression for the Euclidean action:\n\nS<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ φ*(∂/∂τ)φ + (-μφ*φ) - μφ*φ ]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the integral gives:\n\nS<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ φ*(∂/∂τ)φ - 2μφ*φ ]\nS<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x φ*(∂/∂τ - 2μ)φ\n\nFinally, substituting this action back into the path integral expression for the partition function yields the result.\n\nThe partition function Z for a system with the Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂ in the grand canonical ensemble, expressed as a path integral, is:\n\n**Z = ∫D[φ*, φ] exp{ -∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x φ*(τ, x)[(∂/∂τ) - 2μ]φ(τ, x) }**"
