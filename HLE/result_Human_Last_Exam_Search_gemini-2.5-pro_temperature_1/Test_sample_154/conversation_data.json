    "There are 12 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is defined as 2-vertex-connected if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This property means the graph does not have any \"articulation points\" or \"cut vertices\". An equivalent definition is that for any two vertices in the graph, there are at least two paths between them that do not share any vertices other than the endpoints.\n\nTo determine the number of such graphs with 5 vertices, one must first consider all the non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices. There are 34 such graphs in total, of which 21 are connected. A graph must be connected to be 2-vertex-connected. Therefore, the analysis is confined to these 21 graphs.\n\nThe process involves identifying which of these 21 connected graphs have a cut vertex. The graphs with at least one cut vertex are not 2-vertex-connected.\n\nThe 21 connected non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices can be categorized by their number of edges. The graphs that are **not** 2-vertex-connected are:\n*   **The 3 trees with 5 vertices:** Any tree with more than two vertices has at least one cut vertex.\n*   **The 5 connected graphs with 5 vertices that are not the 5-cycle:** These graphs all possess at least one vertex of degree 1 (a \"leaf\"), and the neighbor of a leaf in a graph with more than 2 vertices is a cut vertex. This also applies to several graphs with 6 edges. In total, there are 8 connected graphs on 5 vertices that are not trees but have a leaf vertex.\n*   **The \"bowtie\" or \"hourglass\" graph:** This graph consists of two triangles that share a single common vertex. This central vertex is a cut vertex. This graph has 6 edges and all its vertices have a degree of at least 2.\n\nIn total, there are 3 (trees) + 5 (non-tree graphs with leaves) + 1 (bowtie) = 9 connected graphs with 5 vertices that are *not* 2-vertex-connected.\n\nSince there are 21 connected non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs is the total number of connected graphs minus those that are not 2-vertex-connected.\n\nNumber of 2-vertex-connected graphs = 21 - 9 = 12.\n\nThese 12 graphs are:\n*   The 5-cycle graph (C5)\n*   The 4 2-connected graphs with 6 edges (including the \"house\" graph and the complete bipartite graph K2,3)\n*   The 4 2-connected graphs with 7 edges\n*   The 2 graphs with 8 edges (K5 missing two edges)\n*   The 1 graph with 9 edges (K5 missing one edge)\n*   The complete graph K5 with 10 edges\n\n<<<12>>>"
