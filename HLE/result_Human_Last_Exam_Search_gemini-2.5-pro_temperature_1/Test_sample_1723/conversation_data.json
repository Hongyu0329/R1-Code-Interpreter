    "There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile numerous mushrooms exhibit blue coloration on their caps and stems, their spore prints are consistently other colors. For instance, the strikingly blue *Entoloma hochstetteri* from New Zealand has a pink spore print. Similarly, the *Lactarius indigo*, a blue mushroom found in North and Central America and East Asia, produces a yellow to cream-colored spore print. Another example is the Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*), which has a purple-brown spore print.\n\nMushroom spore prints are a crucial characteristic for identification and typically range in color from white and cream to black, with various shades of brown, red, and purple. Green is a rare spore print color, found in the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*. However, current mycological literature and resources do not mention blue as a possible spore print color.\n\nAlthough there are rare, entirely blue mushrooms like *Neolecta caeruleoporus*, information regarding their spore print color is not readily available, and they are not known for producing blue spores. Therefore, the premise that a single genus of mushroom is known for a distinctly blue spore print appears to be incorrect.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
