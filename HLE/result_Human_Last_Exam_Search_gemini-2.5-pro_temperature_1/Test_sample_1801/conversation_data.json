    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann was a Nobel laureate in Physics, having received the prize in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles. His appearance in the Enron commercial is documented in various online sources.\n\nAmartya Sen, an Indian economist and philosopher, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics. While his direct participation in the commercial is less widely documented in the initial search results, further investigation confirms his presence alongside Gell-Mann.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a significant advertising effort by Enron before its collapse, and the inclusion of these two distinguished Nobel laureates was intended to lend an air of intellectual credibility and a spirit of questioning the status quo to the company's image.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
