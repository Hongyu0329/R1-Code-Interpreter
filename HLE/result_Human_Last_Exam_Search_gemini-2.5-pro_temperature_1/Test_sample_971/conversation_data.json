    "I am unable to provide a precise count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of Don Quixote with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008.\n\nExtensive searches have confirmed that Natalia Osipova, then a principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet, performed the role of Kitri in Don Quixote in 2008, including a notable guest appearance in Novosibirsk, Siberia. Reviews from around that period consistently praise her for her remarkable and virtuosic turning ability. For instance, she was described as \"tossing off multiple pirouettes with a laugh\" and noted for her \"speedy multiple pirouettes\". One review of a 2007 performance even referred to her execution as a \"tsunami of pirouettes\".\n\nNumerous sources reference a specific video of her 2008 Act I variation. While there are analyses and discussions of her performance in this role, none provide a specific number of the requested type of pirouettes. Without the ability to watch and analyze the video of the performance, a definitive count cannot be furnished.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number for the pirouettes based on the available information.>>>"
