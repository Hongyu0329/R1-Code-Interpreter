For a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2) with spin-orbit coupling, the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers are j = 3/2 and j = 1/2.

The common eigenvalues of J² and Jz are:
*   When j = 3/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ². For this j, the eigenvalues of Jz are m_jħ, where m_j can be -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2.
*   When j = 1/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ². For this j, the eigenvalues of Jz are m_jħ, where m_j can be -1/2, 1/2.
