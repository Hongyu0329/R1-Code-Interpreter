    "###Eigenvalues of Total Angular Momentum for a p-electron in Spin-Orbit Coupling\n\nIn the problem of a p-electron subject to spin-orbit coupling, the total angular momentum, denoted by **J**, is the sum of the orbital angular momentum **L** and the spin angular momentum **S**. The operators for the square of the total angular momentum, **J²**, and the z-component of the total angular momentum, **Jz**, commute with each other. This allows for a set of common eigenstates for both operators, which are characterized by their respective eigenvalues.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is **l = 1**, and the electron's spin angular momentum quantum number is **s = 1/2**.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, **j**, are determined by the rule of angular momentum addition, ranging from |l - s| to l + s in integer steps.\n*   **j_min** = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   **j_max** = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the possible values for **j** are **1/2** and **3/2**.\n\nFor each value of **j**, the magnetic quantum number, **m_j**, which corresponds to the z-component of the total angular momentum, can take values from **-j** to **+j** in integer steps.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the **J²** operator are given by **j(j + 1)ħ²**, and the eigenvalues of the **Jz** operator are given by **m_jħ**.\n\nThe common eigenvalues for **J²** and **Jz** are therefore determined for each possible value of **j**:\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of **J²** is:\n    3/2 * (3/2 + 1)ħ² = **(15/4)ħ²**\n*   The possible values for **m_j** are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues of **Jz** are:\n    **-3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, 3/2 ħ**\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of **J²** is:\n    1/2 * (1/2 + 1)ħ² = **(3/4)ħ²**\n*   The possible values for **m_j** are -1/2 and 1/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues of **Jz** are:\n    **-1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ**\n\nIn summary, the sets of common eigenvalues for **J²** and **Jz** for a p-electron undergoing spin-orbit coupling are:\n\n*   For **j = 3/2**, the **J²** eigenvalue is **(15/4)ħ²**, and the **Jz** eigenvalues are **-3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, and 3/2 ħ**.\n*   For **j = 1/2**, the **J²** eigenvalue is **(3/4)ħ²**, and the **Jz** eigenvalues are **-1/2 ħ and 1/2 ħ**.\n\nEach common eigenstate is uniquely defined by a specific pair of (j, m_j) values.\n\n<<<For a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2) with spin-orbit coupling, the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers are j = 3/2 and j = 1/2.\n\nThe common eigenvalues of J² and Jz are:\n*   When j = 3/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ². For this j, the eigenvalues of Jz are m_jħ, where m_j can be -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2.\n*   When j = 1/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ². For this j, the eigenvalues of Jz are m_jħ, where m_j can be -1/2, 1/2.>>>"
