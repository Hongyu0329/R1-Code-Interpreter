    "In the provided chess position, White's optimal move is to exchange queens, leading to a winning pawn endgame.\n\nThe position is defined by the FEN string 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1.\n\nWhite's primary advantage is the advanced passed pawn on d6. Black's queen on c5 is the main piece preventing this pawn from promoting and simultaneously creating threats. Therefore, White's best course of action is to eliminate the active black queen.\n\nThe correct move is:\n\n**1. Qxc5+**\n\nThis forces Black to recapture with their b-pawn:\n\n**1... bxc5**\n\nThis trade transitions the game into a pawn endgame where White has a clear winning plan. The resulting position is `8/3p4/2kP4/p1p5/P7/8/8/6K1 w - - 1 2`. White will now use their king to support the creation of an outside passed pawn on the a-file. This outside pawn will act as a decoy, drawing the black king away and allowing White's king to capture Black's remaining pawns.\n\nA likely continuation demonstrates White's winning strategy:\n\n**2. Kf2 Kxd6**\n**3. Ke3 Ke5**\n**4. Kd3 d5**\n**5. a5!**\n\nWhite creates the outside passed pawn, which secures the victory with precise play.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
