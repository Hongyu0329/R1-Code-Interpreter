    "In the film industry, the hierarchy of sound importance in dance scenes is generally as follows:\n\nMusic is paramount, as it drives the rhythm, mood, and choreography of the entire sequence. The dance itself is performed and edited to the musical track.\n\nFollowing music are the sound effects. These are often created through foley to capture and accentuate the dancers' movements, such as the sound of footsteps or the rustle of clothing, adding a layer of realism and impact to the performance.\n\nSpeech, or dialogue, typically holds the lowest priority in a dance scene. If dialogue is present, the music is often \"dipped\" or lowered in the sound mix to ensure the words are audible without disrupting the musical flow. In many cases, any vocalization is part of the song's lyrics, integrating it directly into the primary musical element.\n\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
