No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ fundamentally in their monomer units and the chemical bonds that link them. Polynucleotides are polymers of nucleotides (composed of a sugar, phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds. Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides (simple sugars) linked by glycosidic bonds.
