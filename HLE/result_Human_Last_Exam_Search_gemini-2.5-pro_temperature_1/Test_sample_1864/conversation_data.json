    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a minimum of **13 essential controls** to ensure accurate data and proper sorting. These controls are categorized as follows:\n\n### 1. Unstained Control (1 tube)\nThis is the most basic control and is essential for any flow cytometry experiment.\n*   **Purpose**: To determine the baseline autofluorescence of your cells or beads and to set the initial voltage settings for the detectors.\n*   **Composition**: A sample of your cells or beads that has not been treated with any fluorescent reagents but has undergone all washing and incubation steps.\n\n### 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes)\nThese controls are absolutely necessary for any experiment involving two or more fluorophores.\n*   **Purpose**: To correct for spectral overlap, which is the spillover of a fluorophore's emission signal into a detector that is not its primary channel. The software uses these controls to calculate a compensation matrix.\n*   **Composition**: Five separate samples are required. Each sample is stained with only one of the fluorophores used in the panel (i.e., one for AF350, one for GFP, one for PE, one for AF647, and one for AF750). These controls must contain both a positive and a negative population for accurate calculation. Compensation beads can be used for this purpose.\n\n### 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes)\nFMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially in a multicolor sorting experiment where the purity of the sorted population is crucial.\n*   **Purpose**: To identify the spread of fluorescence from all other fluorophores into a specific channel. This allows for the precise placement of the gate that separates the true positive cells from the negative population, which is often ambiguous due to spillover spread.\n*   **Composition**: Five separate samples are needed. Each FMO control is stained with all the fluorophores in your panel *except one*. For example, the PE FMO control would contain AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750, but not PE.\n\n### 4. Viability Control (1 tube)\nExcluding dead cells is essential for clean and accurate sorting results, as dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence.\n*   **Purpose**: To distinguish between live and dead cells, allowing you to gate on and sort only the live cells.\n*   **Composition**: If one of your fluorophores (e.g., AF350) is used as a viability dye, you will need a control sample to set the gate for dead cells. This is often a sample of your cells that has been compromised (e.g., by heat-killing) and then stained with the viability dye to establish a clear \"dead\" positive signal.\n\n### 5. Streptavidin System Control (1 tube)\nThis control is specific to your use of streptavidin.\n*   **Purpose**: To ensure that the signal from your streptavidin-conjugated fluorophore is due to a specific interaction with its biotinylated target and not from non-specific binding of the streptavidin to the cells or beads.\n*   **Composition**: A sample that includes the cells/beads and the fluorescently labeled streptavidin but *lacks* the biotinylated antibody or component. This will reveal any background signal attributable to the streptavidin reagent itself.\n\nIn summary, preparing these 13 controls (1 Unstained + 5 Compensation + 5 FMO + 1 Viability + 1 Streptavidin) is an essential part of a well-designed, five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n<<<13>>>"
