The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is defined by the Berezin integration rules: the integral of the measure itself is zero, and the integral of the Grassmann variable with respect to its measure is one. For a single Grassmann variable η, this is expressed as: ∫ dη = 0 and ∫ dη η = 1.
