    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is maintained through the use of Grassmann variables. These are anticommuting numbers, meaning that for any two Grassmann variables, η and θ, their product anticommutes: ηθ = -θη. A direct consequence of this is that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero (e.g., η² = 0), which is the mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle, forbidding two identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state.\n\nThe integration measure for a single Grassmann variable, dη, is defined by the following rules, often referred to as Berezin integration:\n\n*   ∫ dη = 0\n*   ∫ dη η = 1\n\nThese rules are fundamental to the formalism. The first rule states that the integral of a constant is zero, and the second rule provides a non-trivial result only when the integrand is the Grassmann variable itself.\n\nFor a system with multiple Grassmann variables, say η₁ and η₂, the integration measure is dη₁dη₂. The order of integration matters due to the anticommuting nature. The integral is evaluated by applying the single-variable rules iteratively from the innermost integral outwards. For instance, the integral of a function f(η₁, η₂) = c₀ + c₁η₁ + c₂η₂ + c₁₂η₁η₂ is performed as follows:\n\n∫ dη₁ dη₂ f(η₁, η₂) = ∫ dη₁ dη₂ (c₀ + c₁η₁ + c₂η₂ + c₁₂η₁η₂) = ∫ dη₁ (c₂ + c₁₂η₁) = c₁₂\n\nHere, the only term that survives the integration is the one containing all the Grassmann variables.\n\nIn essence, the \"value\" of the measure is not a single number but is defined by these specific integration rules that are designed to be consistent with the anticommuting algebra of the Grassmann variables, which in turn ensures the Pauli exclusion principle is upheld within the path integral formalism.\n\n<<<The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is defined by the Berezin integration rules: the integral of the measure itself is zero, and the integral of the Grassmann variable with respect to its measure is one. For a single Grassmann variable η, this is expressed as: ∫ dη = 0 and ∫ dη η = 1.>>>"
