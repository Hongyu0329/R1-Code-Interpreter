    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by connecting two complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge, known as the bottleneck edge. For a 10-node graph, the most standard configuration consists of two K5 cliques (complete graphs with 5 nodes each).\n\nHere's how to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge:\n\n1.  **Calculate the number of edges in each clique:** A complete graph with *n* nodes has *n*(n-1)/2 edges. For a K5 clique, this is 5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10 edges.\n2.  **Calculate the total number of edges:** The graph consists of two K5 cliques and one bottleneck edge connecting them.\n    *   Edges in the first K5: 10\n    *   Edges in the second K5: 10\n    *   Bottleneck edge: 1\n    *   Total edges = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21\n3.  **Determine the sampling probability:** Randomized uniform gossiping with uniform weights implies that each edge has an equal chance of being selected. The probability of sampling any single edge is 1 divided by the total number of edges.\n\nTherefore, the probability of sampling the single bottleneck edge is 1/21.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
