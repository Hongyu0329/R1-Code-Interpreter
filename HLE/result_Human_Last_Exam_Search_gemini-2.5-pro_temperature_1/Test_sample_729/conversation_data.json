    "A power subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element, which is the definition of a cyclic subgroup. To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, we need to find the number of its distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 128 is denoted as Q_128 or sometimes as Q_2^7. This group has a specific structure that dictates the nature of its subgroups. A key property is that every subgroup of a generalized quaternion group is either cyclic or itself a generalized quaternion group.\n\nThe structure of Q_128 is given by the presentation:\n⟨x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^-1 = x^-1⟩\n\nThe group Q_128 consists of elements that can be uniquely written as x^i or x^i*y for 0 ≤ i < 64.\n\nWe can categorize the cyclic subgroups into two types:\n\n1.  **Subgroups generated by powers of x:**\n    The element *x* generates a cyclic subgroup of order 64, denoted as ⟨x⟩. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order *n* is equal to the number of divisors of *n*. For ⟨x⟩ of order 64, the number of subgroups is the number of divisors of 64. Since 64 = 2^6, its divisors are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, and 2^6. This gives a total of 7 cyclic subgroups.\n\n2.  **Subgroups generated by elements of the form x^i*y:**\n    Every element outside the subgroup ⟨x⟩ has the form x^i*y and has an order of 4. There are 64 such elements (for i from 0 to 63). Each of these elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n\n    Let's consider when two such elements, say x^i*y and x^j*y, generate the same subgroup. The non-trivial elements of the subgroup ⟨x^i*y⟩ are x^i*y, (x^i*y)^2 = x^32, and (x^i*y)^3 = x^(i+32)*y. For ⟨x^i*y⟩ to be the same as ⟨x^j*y⟩, x^j*y must be an element of ⟨x^i*y⟩. This occurs if j is congruent to i modulo 64 or j is congruent to i+32 modulo 64. This means that each cyclic subgroup of this type is generated by exactly two distinct elements.\n\n    Since there are 64 elements of the form x^i*y, and each corresponding cyclic subgroup is generated by two of these elements, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of this form is 64 / 2 = 32.\n\nThese 32 cyclic subgroups of order 4 are distinct from the cyclic subgroup of order 4 contained within ⟨x⟩ (which is ⟨x^16⟩), as they contain elements not in ⟨x⟩.\n\nTherefore, the total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in Q_128 is the sum of the subgroups from both categories: 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
