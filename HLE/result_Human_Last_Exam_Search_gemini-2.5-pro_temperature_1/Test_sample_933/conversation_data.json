    "The synthesis of xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is most commonly and efficiently achieved by heating xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gases. The reaction is typically conducted in a nickel vessel because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the standard and efficient temperature for this direct synthesis is 400°C. The reaction involves a mixture of xenon and fluorine, often in a 1:5 molar ratio, and is carried out under pressure, for example, at 6 atm. A US patent for the process specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferable temperature.\n\nWhile other methods exist, such as using an electric discharge, these often result in contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF2). Another synthesis method involves the combustion of xenon in fluorine, which is initiated by heating a filament to 650-700°C. However, the most widely cited and controlled thermal method for producing pure XeF4 operates at 400°C.\n\nBased on the provided options, 400°C is the most well-documented and efficient temperature for the production of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
