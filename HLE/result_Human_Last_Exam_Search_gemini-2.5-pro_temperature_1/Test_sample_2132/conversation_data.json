    "### Product of the Favorskii Rearrangement of 2-Chlorocyclohexanone\n\nThe Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone results in a ring contraction. When carried out with a base such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol, the product is **ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate**. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which is then opened by the ethoxide nucleophile to yield the final ester product.\n\n### Böttcher Molecular Complexity\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity (C_m) is a metric used to quantify the structural complexity of a molecule. It is based on information theory and calculates a value, in \"mcbits,\" by summing the information content of the chemical microenvironment of every atom in the molecule. This index is sensitive to various molecular features including stereochemistry, branching, unsaturated bonds, the presence of heteroatoms, and molecular symmetry.\n\n### Determining the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of Ethyl Cyclopentanecarboxylate\n\nCalculating the Böttcher Molecular Complexity manually is an intricate process that requires the determination of several parameters for each non-hydrogen atom, including valence electrons, number of bonds, chemically non-equivalent bonds, element diversity, and stereochemistry, as well as a correction for the molecule's overall symmetry.\n\nDue to the complexity of a manual calculation, a precise value for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate cannot be provided without the use of specialized software.\n\nHowever, the value can be readily obtained using the online **Böttcher Score calculator** provided by the Forli Lab at Scripps Research. To use this tool, the molecule's structure is required, which can be provided as a SMILES string.\n\nThe SMILES string for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is: **CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1**\n\nBy inputting this SMILES string into the calculator, the Böttcher Molecular Complexity score can be accurately determined.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a numerical answer as it requires using an external online tool. The product of the reaction is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, and its Böttcher Molecular Complexity can be found using the Böttcher Score calculator with the SMILES string CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1.>>>"
