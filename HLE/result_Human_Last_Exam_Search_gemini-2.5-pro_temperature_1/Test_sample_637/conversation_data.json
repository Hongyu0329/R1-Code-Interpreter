    "To design an observer for the discrete-time system such that the observation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps, a \"deadbeat\" observer is required. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix at the origin (z=0).\n\nThe given system is:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith the matrices:\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1],, [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\nB = [,, [-1],]\nC = [,]\n\nThe observer dynamics are given by:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))\nwhere x̂ is the estimated state, ŷ = Cx̂ is the estimated output, and L is the observer gain matrix.\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k) are described by the equation:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor a deadbeat observer, the goal is to choose L such that all eigenvalues of the matrix (A - LC) are zero. This ensures that the error e(k) will become identically zero after a finite number of steps. The shortest possible time for this convergence is determined by the observability index of the system, which for this system is ν=3. However, placing all eigenvalues at the origin guarantees convergence in at most n=4 steps, where n is the dimension of the state vector.\n\nThe design can be simplified by using only a subset of the outputs, provided the system remains observable. Let's use only the first output, y₁, which corresponds to the first row of C, denoted as c₁ = [1 0 0 0]. This is permissible because the pair (A, c₁) is observable. This choice means the resulting gain matrix L will have its second column entirely composed of zeros.\n\nThe problem is now to find a column vector l = [l₁, l₂, l₃, l₄]ᵀ such that the matrix (A - l c₁) has all its eigenvalues at zero. This is a pole placement problem. The desired characteristic polynomial is p(z) = z⁴ = 0.\n\nBy deriving the characteristic polynomial of (A - l c₁) in terms of the elements of l and equating its coefficients to zero, we obtain a system of linear equations for l₁, l₂, l₃, and l₄.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of (A - l c₁) is found to be:\np(z) = z⁴ + (2+l₁)z³ + (3+l₁+l₄)z² + (-1+l₁+l₃)z + (-3-2l₁+l₂)\n\nSetting the coefficients of z³, z², z¹, and z⁰ to zero yields the following system of equations:\n1.  2 + l₁ = 0  =>  l₁ = -2\n2.  3 + l₁ + l₄ = 0  =>  3 - 2 + l₄ = 0  =>  l₄ = -1\n3.  -1 + l₁ + l₃ = 0  =>  -1 - 2 + l₃ = 0  =>  l₃ = 3\n4.  -3 - 2l₁ + l₂ = 0  =>  -3 - 2(-2) + l₂ = 0  => 1 + l₂ = 0 => l₂ = -1\n\nThis gives the gain vector l = [-2, -1, 3, -1]ᵀ. Since we only used the first output, the full observer gain matrix L is constructed by placing this vector in the first column and having a second column of zeros.\n\n<<<\nL = [[-2, 0],\n     [-1, 0],\n     [ 3, 0],\n     [-1, 0]]\n>>>"
