    "I am unable to provide a numerical answer to the question of how many involutions are in PSU(4,997) with the available search results.\n\nHere is a summary of the information that has been gathered and the missing pieces needed to answer the question:\n\n*   **Definition of an Involution:** An involution is an element of a group that has an order of 2, meaning it is not the identity element and its square is the identity element.\n\n*   **The Group in Question:** The group is the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997). This is a finite simple group of Lie type over the finite field with 997 elements. Since 997 is a prime number, it is a finite field.\n\n*   **Dependence on Modulo 8:** The number of conjugacy classes of involutions in PSU(4, q) for odd q depends on the congruence of q modulo 8. For the specific case of PSU(4, 997), we have 997 ≡ 5 (mod 8).\n\n*   **Existing Literature:**\n    *   A paper by Phan (1971) characterizes PSU(4, q²) for odd q and states there is one conjugacy class of involutions if q ≡ 3 (mod 8) and two classes if q ≡ -1 (mod 8). However, this paper does not explicitly cover the case where the parameter is congruent to 5 modulo 8.\n    *   Other search results allude to the complexity of determining the number of conjugacy classes and the structure of their centralizers in unitary groups, often referencing specialized literature like the ATLAS of Finite Groups or specific research papers that are not fully accessible through the search tool.\n\nTo determine the total number of involutions, one would need to:\n1.  Find the exact number of conjugacy classes of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q ≡ 5 (mod 8).\n2.  For each of these conjugacy classes, find the structure and order of the centralizer of a representative involution.\n3.  The size of each conjugacy class is the order of the group PSU(4, 997) divided by the order of the centralizer of an involution in that class.\n4.  The total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of all conjugacy classes of involutions.\n\nWithout access to a definitive resource that provides the number of conjugacy classes and their corresponding centralizer orders for PSU(4, q) where q ≡ 5 (mod 8), it is not possible to perform this calculation.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer for the number of involutions in PSU(4,997) based on the available information.>>>"
