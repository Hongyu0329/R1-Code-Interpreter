    "To determine the probability of finding a particle in a specific interval within a one-dimensional box, we must use the principles of quantum mechanics. The probability is found by integrating the probability density, |ψ(x)|², over the given interval.\n\n### 1. The Wavefunction and Probability Density\n\nFor a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction is given by:\n*   ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nHere, 'n' is the principal quantum number. For the state n = 2, the wavefunction is:\n*   ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\n*   P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\n### 2. Setting up the Probability Integral\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a is calculated by the integral of the probability density over this range:\n\n*   P(0.495a ≤ x ≤ 0.505a) = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nFor the state n=2, the wavefunction has a node (a point where the probability of finding the particle is zero) at the center of the box, x = a/2 or 0.5a. The requested interval is a very small region centered around this node.\n\n### 3. Solving the Integral\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. In our case, θ = 2πx/a.\n\nP = (2/a) ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (1/2) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n\nP = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }\nP = { (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\n### 4. Approximation for a Small Interval\n\nSince the interval is very small and centered on a node, a direct calculation is possible, but an approximation provides excellent insight and accuracy. We can expand the `sin²` term around the node at x = a/2. Let x = a/2 + u, where u is a small displacement.\n\nsin(2πx/a) = sin(2π(a/2 + u)/a) = sin(π + 2πu/a) = -sin(2πu/a)\nsin²(2πx/a) ≈ (2πu/a)² for small u.\n\nThe integral becomes:\nP ≈ ∫₋₀.₀₀₅ₐ⁰.₀₀₅ₐ (2/a) * (2πu/a)² du\nP ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫₋₀.₀₀₅ₐ⁰.₀₀₅ₐ u² du\nP ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\nP ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [ (0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³ ]\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nUsing the approximation formula derived above:\n*   P ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (0.005)³\n*   P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   P ≈ 52.638 * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   P ≈ 6.57975 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
