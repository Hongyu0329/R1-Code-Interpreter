The precise value of the Crawley-Nordstr√∂m invariant for the Calabi-Yau link defined by the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) cannot be determined without specialized computational algebraic geometry software and is not available in public search results. The calculation is highly non-trivial and there is no known simple formula.
