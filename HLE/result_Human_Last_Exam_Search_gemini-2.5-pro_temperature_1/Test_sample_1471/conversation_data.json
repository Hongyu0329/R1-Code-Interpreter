    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numbers.\n\n*   **IV** is 4.\n*   **VIII** is 8.\n*   **MMMDCCLXXVII** is 3777.\n*   **MCMXCIX** is 1999.\n\nThe equation in modern numbers is:\n4 / 8 - 3777 - 1999 = ?\n\nFollowing the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we perform division before subtraction.\n\n1.  **Division:** 4 / 8 = 0.5\n2.  **Subtraction:** 0.5 - 3777 = -3776.5\n3.  **Subtraction:** -3776.5 - 1999 = -5775.5\n\n<<<-5775.5>>>"
