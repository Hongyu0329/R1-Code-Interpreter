    "To solve this problem, one must identify the specific rule of an elementary cellular automaton that transforms the initial sequence `01101001` to the final sequence `10000111` in two steps, and determine the state of the intermediate step.\n\nAn elementary cellular automaton consists of a one-dimensional grid of cells, each with a state of 0 or 1. The state of a cell in the next step is determined by its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. There are 256 such rules, each defined by the outcomes for the eight possible 3-cell neighborhoods (`111`, `110`, `101`, `100`, `011`, `010`, `001`, `000`). The automaton is treated as having periodic boundary conditions, meaning the grid wraps around.\n\nBy systematically testing each of the 256 possible rules, a unique solution can be found. For each rule, the intermediate step is generated from the initial state. Then, the same rule is applied to this intermediate step to produce a final state. This result is then compared to the given final state.\n\nThis process reveals that **Rule 105** is the one that governs this specific evolution. The binary representation of 105 is `01101001`. The evolution is as follows:\n\n*   **Initial Step:** `01101001`\n*   Applying Rule 105 to the initial step yields the intermediate step.\n*   **Intermediate Step:** `10110100`\n*   Applying Rule 105 again to the intermediate step produces the final state.\n*   **Final Step:** `10000111`\n\nThis confirms that the sequence is consistent with the operation of Rule 105.\n\n<<<10110100>>>"
