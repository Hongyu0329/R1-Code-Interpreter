    "## The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 546.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in essence, seeks to classify imaginary quadratic fields by their class number. For any given positive integer *n*, the problem is to compile a complete list of all imaginary quadratic fields that have a class number of exactly *n*. This task is equivalent to identifying all negative fundamental discriminants for which the corresponding class number is *n*.\n\nA fundamental discriminant is a specific type of integer used in the study of quadratic number fields. An integer *d* is considered a fundamental discriminant if it is not equal to 1, is not divisible by the square of any odd prime number, and satisfies the condition of being congruent to 1 modulo 4, or congruent to 8 or 12 modulo 16. When such a discriminant is a negative number, it is referred to as a negative fundamental discriminant.\n\nAccording to research and tabulated data in the field of number theory, specifically from a paper by Mark Watkins on the class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields, the number of negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48 has been determined. The established count is 546.\n\n<<<546>>>"
