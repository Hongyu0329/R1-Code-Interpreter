    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is a summary of the reasoning:\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Function's Properties\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties that any such continuous function $f$ must have.\n\n*   **Injectivity**: If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$, so $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n*   **Monotonicity**: Since $f$ is a continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n*   **Range**: The range of $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. Let $R_f$ be the range of $f$. Then the image of $R_f$ under $f$ must be $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n### 2. The Case of a Strictly Decreasing Function\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing. A continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point, say $x_0$, such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. This is because the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$ is continuous and must go from positive to negative values (or vice-versa), thus crossing zero.\n\nIf such a fixed point exists, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. But according to the given equation, $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$. This leads to the equation $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$, which has no real solutions. Therefore, there are **no strictly decreasing continuous solutions**.\n\n### 3. The Case of a Strictly Increasing Function\n\nNow, let's assume $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\n*   The function cannot have any fixed points, so we must have either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would mean $\\exp(x) < x$, which is false for all real numbers.\n*   Therefore, any solution must be strictly increasing and satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIt can be shown that such functions exist. In fact, a whole family of solutions can be constructed. The key idea is that a solution is not unique and can be constructed by defining it on a specific interval and then extending it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the given functional equation.\n\n### 4. Constructing Solutions and Determining Cardinality\n\nA method to construct solutions involves the following steps:\n1.  Choose a constant $c > 0$.\n2.  Choose any strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi$ that maps the interval $[c, e^c]$ to $[e^c, e^{e^c}]$.\n3.  Define $f(x) = \\phi(x)$ for $x \\in [c, e^c]$.\n4.  Extend this definition to the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relations $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ and its inverse $f(\\ln x) = \\ln(f(x))$.\n\nThe choice of the function $\\phi$ in step 2 is not unique. The number of such continuous, strictly increasing functions is uncountably infinite. We can demonstrate this by constructing a distinct function for every real number in a given interval, which shows that the set of possible functions $\\phi$ has a cardinality of at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since the set of solutions is a subset of this, its cardinality can be no more than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nGiven that we can construct at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions and the total number of continuous functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, we can conclude that the cardinality of the set of solutions is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is supported by discussions on this topic in various mathematical forums.\n\n<<<c>>>"
