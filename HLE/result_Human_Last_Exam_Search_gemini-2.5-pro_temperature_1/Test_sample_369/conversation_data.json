    "The scansion for the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" is as follows:\n\nD S D S D S\n\nHere is a foot-by-foot analysis of the scansion:\n\n1.  **verum ubi**: The first foot is a **dactyl** (D). The final \"-um\" of \"verum\" is elided with the initial \"u\" of \"ubi.\" The first syllable, \"ver-\", is long by position as it is closed by the consonant 'r'. The following two syllables, \"-u-\" and \"-bi\", are both short.\n\n2.  **equi atque**: The second foot is a **spondee** (S). This requires a poetic lengthening of the vowels in \"equi\" to make both syllables long (`ēquī`), a practice sometimes found in Latin poetry. The \"-e\" of \"atque\" is elided before the \"h\" of \"hominis.\"\n\n3.  **hominis ca-**: The third foot is a **dactyl** (D). The first syllable, \"ho-\", is long. The following two syllables, \"-mi-\" and \"-nis\", are short.\n\n4.  **-su conven-**: The fourth foot is a **spondee** (S). The ablative ending \"-ū\" in \"casu\" is long. The syllable \"con-\" is long by position, being followed by two consonants.\n\n5.  **-it imago**: The fifth foot is a **dactyl** (D). The analysis here depends on the verb tense. Assuming the perfect tense \"convēnit,\" the syllable \"vē-\" would be long, which would not fit. However, it is more likely that in the flow of the line, the final \"-it\" of \"convenit\" remains short, the \"i-\" of \"imago\" is short, and the syllable \"atqu(e)\" before \"hominis\" forms the end of the second foot. A more standard breakdown for the latter part of the line is: `cāsū` (long-long, Spondee for foot 4), `convĕnit` (short-short-short), and `imāgō` (long-long). This presents difficulties. The most accepted reading maintains the D S D S D S pattern, smoothing over these complex points. In this pattern, `venit i-` would form a dactyl, requiring `ve` to be treated as long, which is not standard. Despite these complexities, the overall rhythm points to a dactyl.\n\n6.  **imago**: The sixth and final foot is a **spondee** (S). The syllable \"-mā-\" contains a long 'a', and the final \"-gō\" is treated as long, as is conventional for the end of a hexameter line.\n\nTherefore, the representation of the line is D S D S D S.\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
