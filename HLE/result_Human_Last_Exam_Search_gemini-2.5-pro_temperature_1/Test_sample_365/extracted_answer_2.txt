The product is a tricyclic ketone formed through an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. Key structural changes include the cleavage of the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene core, formation of a new C-C bond between C5 (norbornene) and C1' (cyclopentene), creation of a ketone at C2, and a new double bond at C1-C6. The TBDMS ether and the 7,7-dimethoxy ketal remain intact.
