    "This sequence does not appear to be a standard mathematical sequence found in common databases. However, a pattern can be discerned by analyzing the structure and repetition of the numbers within the sequence itself, particularly towards the end.\n\nLet's examine the final portion of the sequence:\n\n..., 10, **36, 36, 36**, **124, 124, 124**, **36, 124**\n\nIf we denote the number 36 as 'A' and the number 124 as 'B', the tail end of the sequence can be represented as:\n\n**A, A, A, B, B, B, A, B**\n\nThis structure, with two groups of three identical numbers followed by an alternating pair, suggests a simple symbolic pattern. The most logical continuation of the alternating `A, B` pattern would be `A`.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
