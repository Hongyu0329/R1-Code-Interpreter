    "A self-intersection point of the curve (x(t), y(t)) occurs when x(t₁) = x(t₂) and y(t₁) = y(t₂) for two different parameter values t₁ and t₂. The given curve is a Lissajous curve with parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\nFor a Lissajous curve of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, a formula can be used to determine the number of self-intersection points. In this case, a = 9 and b = 5. Both 'a' and 'b' are odd integers.\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points when both a and b are odd and coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1) is given by:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nHere, a = 9 and b = 5. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are coprime.\nPlugging the values into the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
