    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nThis reaction is a multiple Grignard cross-coupling reaction. The reactivity of the carbon-halogen bonds with the Grignard reagent follows the order C-I > C-Br > C-Cl. Consequently, the iodine atom is substituted first by a phenyl group. Due to the use of an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide, the two bromine atoms are subsequently substituted by phenyl groups.\n\nThe step-by-step reaction is as follows:\n1.  **First Substitution:** 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene reacts with one equivalent of phenyl magnesium bromide to substitute the most reactive halogen, iodine. This forms 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  **Second and Third Substitutions:** Since phenyl magnesium bromide is in excess, it will then react with the less reactive bromine atoms. Both bromine atoms are replaced by phenyl groups.\n3.  **Final Product:** The complete substitution of all three halogen atoms (one iodine and two bromines) by phenyl groups yields 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n4.  **Aqueous Work-up:** The final step involves an aqueous work-up, which quenches any remaining Grignard reagent and neutralizes the magnesium salts, leaving the stable organic product, 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the final product is therefore **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
