    "Had the Norse never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for a female sibling would likely be **suster** (pronounced to rhyme with \"duster\") or possibly **swester**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is, in fact, a product of Norse linguistic influence. The original Old English or Anglo-Saxon word for a female sibling was ***sweostor***, with regional variations such as *swuster*. This native word is a cognate of the Old Norse word *systir*—both descend from the same Proto-Germanic root, **swestēr*.\n\nDuring the period of Viking settlement in England (the Danelaw), the Old English and Old Norse languages mingled. Because the two languages were closely related, words were often easily exchanged and adapted. In the case of \"sister,\" the Old Norse pronunciation with an \"i\" sound eventually won out and replaced the native \"eo\" or \"u\" sound of *sweostor* and its Middle English descendant, *suster*.\n\nIf English had evolved without this Norse influence, *sweostor* would have followed a different path. The most common form in Middle English was *suster*. Following the typical sound changes that occurred in English, where the Middle English short \"u\" sound (as in \"put\") often became the modern /ʌ/ sound (as in \"cup\" or \"duster\"), the word would have naturally evolved into **suster**.\n\nAnother, though less probable, evolution could have resulted in **swester**, a form that mirrors the development in other West Germanic languages like German (*Schwester*) and Dutch (*zuster*). However, the prevalence of the *suster* form in Middle English texts makes it the most likely candidate for the modern word in this alternate history.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
