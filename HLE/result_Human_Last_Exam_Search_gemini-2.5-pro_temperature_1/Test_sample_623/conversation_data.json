    "If a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose goes through the process of glycolysis, **zero** ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules will be released.\n\nThe process of glycolysis breaks down one six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. This pathway does not involve any steps where carbon dioxide is released. The six carbons from the original glucose molecule are all present in the two pyruvate molecules at the end of glycolysis.\n\nCarbon dioxide is released in subsequent stages of cellular respiration. Specifically, the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (a process called pyruvate decarboxylation) and the citric acid cycle are where decarboxylation reactions occur.\n\nTo trace the labeled carbons beyond glycolysis:\n*   The ¹³C at position 1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of one pyruvate molecule.\n*   The ¹³C at position 4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nDuring pyruvate decarboxylation, which links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate is removed and released as CO₂. Therefore, one of the labeled carbons (the one from position 4 of glucose) would be released as the first molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ after glycolysis is complete. The second labeled carbon (from position 1 of glucose) would enter the citric acid cycle and be released as CO₂ in later turns of the cycle. However, the question specifically asks about the glycolysis phase, during which no CO₂ is produced.\n\n<<<0>>>"
