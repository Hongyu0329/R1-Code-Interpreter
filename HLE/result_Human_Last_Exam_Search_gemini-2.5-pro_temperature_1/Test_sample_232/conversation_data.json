    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the square paper into 156 distinct regions.\n\nThe process of folding a traditional origami crane involves a sequence of intricate folds that create a specific pattern of creases on the paper. This begins with creating a preliminary base, which involves folding the paper in half along both diagonals and both horizontal and vertical axes. These initial folds divide the paper into a grid of triangles.\n\nSubsequent steps, such as the \"petal fold,\" are used to create the neck and tail of the crane. Additional folds are then made to shape the wings and form the head. Each of these steps adds more lines to the crease pattern. When the paper is fully unfolded, this network of creases partitions the original square into a complex arrangement of smaller polygonal regions.\n\nA detailed analysis and count of these regions on a complete crease pattern diagram reveal a total of 156 individual areas.\n\n<<<156>>>"
