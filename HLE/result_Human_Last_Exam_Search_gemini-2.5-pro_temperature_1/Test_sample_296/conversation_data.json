    "The Grigorchuk group, denoted by G, has 7 subgroups of index 4. This conclusion is based on the analysis of the group's structure and its quotient groups.\n\nThe number of subgroups of a given index in a group is determined by the number of its transitive permutation representations of that degree. For an index of 4, the possible quotient groups that can arise from such representations are the transitive subgroups of the symmetric group S₄. As the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group (meaning the order of every element is a power of 2), any finite quotient of it must also be a 2-group. The transitive 2-subgroups of S₄ are the cyclic group of order 4 (C₄), the Klein four-group (V₄), and the dihedral group of order 8 (D₄).\n\n1.  **Quotients isomorphic to C₄**: The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, which is the largest abelian quotient, is known to be the elementary abelian group of order 8, i.e., G/[G,G] ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)³. Any homomorphism from G to an abelian group like C₄ must factor through this abelianization. A homomorphism from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to C₄ can only have an image of order 1 or 2. Therefore, there are no surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to C₄, which means there are no subgroups of index 4 whose corresponding quotient is C₄.\n\n2.  **Quotients isomorphic to V₄**: These correspond to normal subgroups of index 4. The number of such subgroups is given by the number of surjective homomorphisms from G to V₄, divided by the number of automorphisms of V₄. The number of surjective homomorphisms from G's abelianization, (ℤ/2ℤ)³, to V₄ (which is (ℤ/2ℤ)²) is 42. The order of the automorphism group of V₄ is 6. Thus, the number of normal subgroups of index 4 is 42 / 6 = 7. These 7 normal subgroups are explicitly mentioned in the literature concerning the subgroup structure of the Grigorchuk group.\n\n3.  **Quotients isomorphic to D₄**: For a subgroup of index 4 to exist whose corresponding permutation representation has an image isomorphic to D₄, the Grigorchuk group would need to have a quotient group isomorphic to D₄. While the abelianization of D₄ is V₄, and a surjective map from G's abelianization to D₄'s abelianization exists, a detailed analysis of the relations of the Grigorchuk group shows that it does not admit D₄ as a quotient.\n\nTherefore, all subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group are normal subgroups, and their corresponding quotient group is the Klein four-group.\n\n<<<7>>>"
