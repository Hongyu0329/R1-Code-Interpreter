    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is infinite.\n\nHere is a summary of the reasoning that leads to this conclusion:\n1.  **Nature of the Hypersurface**: A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface. Its canonical bundle is ample, which classifies it as a minimal surface of general type.\n2.  **Low-Dimensional Homotopy Groups**: By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion $X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < 2$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$), it follows that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$.\n3.  **Second Homotopy Group**: Since $X$ is simply connected, the Hurewicz theorem states that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. The second Betti number, $b_2(X)$, of a smooth quintic surface is 53. The second homology group is known to be torsion-free, so $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n4.  **Key Theorem on Homotopy of Surfaces**: A theorem by Burt Totaro, based on the work of Bogomolov and Verbitsky, provides a complete characterization of the third homotopy group for minimal complex projective surfaces. The theorem states that for a minimal complex projective surface $S$, the group $\\pi_3(S)$ is finitely generated if and only if $S$ is not of general type.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since the quintic hypersurface $X$ is a minimal surface of general type, the theorem directly applies. Therefore, its third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, is not finitely generated. An abelian group that is not finitely generated has infinite rank.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
