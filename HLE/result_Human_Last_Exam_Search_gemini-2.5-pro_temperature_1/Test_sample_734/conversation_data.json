    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to describing changes in the laws of nature, relevant to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine (354-430 AD) developed the concept of **\"seminal reasons\" (rationes seminales)** to explain how creation unfolds over time and how miracles are possible within God's established order. According to this doctrine, God embedded the potentialities, or \"seeds,\" of all things that would ever come into being within the initial creation.\n\nThis framework can be applied to both the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** From an Augustinian perspective, the virgin birth of Jesus was not a violation of the natural order but rather the actualization of a \"seminal reason\" for a miraculous birth that was embedded in creation from the beginning. It was a unique event, the potential for which was always present within God's creative plan.\n\n*   **Alterations in Natural Laws at the Fall:** Augustine taught that all of humanity was \"seminally present in the loins of Adam,\" and thus, the consequences of Adam's sin were transmitted to all subsequent generations. This resulted in a corruption of human nature and a change in humanity's relationship with the natural world. While Augustine may not have explicitly stated that the \"laws of nature\" themselves were fundamentally rewritten, his framework of seminal reasons allows for the unfolding of new, punitive conditions within the natural order as a consequence of the Fall. For instance, aspects of the created world that were not harmful to humanity in its original state could become sources of suffering and \"natural evil\" after the Fall, as a result of humanity's altered condition. Some scholars interpret Augustine as believing that after the Fall, many features of the good creation began to function in a way that causes harm to humanity.\n\nWhile Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274) later developed the term **\"obediential potency\"** to describe a creature's capacity to be acted upon by God beyond its natural capabilities, a concept also applicable to the virgin birth, Augustine's development of \"seminal reasons\" predates Aquinas's work and provides a comprehensive framework for understanding both the miraculous and the altered state of nature after the Fall. Furthermore, the historical renewal of Augustinian thought during the Protestant Reformation highlighted the significant impact of the Fall on the natural world and human cognition, influencing the development of scientific methods to overcome these limitations.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
