$\tau_w\dot{w_i} = \beta u_i \left( 1 - \frac{\rho}{1+v_i} \right)$
This can also be written as:
$\tau_w\dot{w_i} = \beta u_i \frac{1+v_i-\rho}{1+v_i}$
where:
*   $v_i = \phi \bar{x}_i$ is the presynaptic accumulator.
*   $u_i = \sum_j w_j \bar{x}_j$ is the shared postsynaptic accumulator.
*   $\rho = (1-\alpha/\beta)(1-\eta)$ is a dimensionless constant representing the plasticity threshold.
