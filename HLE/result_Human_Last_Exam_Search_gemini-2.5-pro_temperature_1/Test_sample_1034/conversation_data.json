    "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the value of `S` from the string `SNYWR`. By using the standard telephone keypad mapping, we can convert the letters to numbers.\n\n*   S is on the '7' key (PQRS)\n*   N is on the '6' key (MNO)\n*   Y is on the '9' key (WXYZ)\n*   W is on the '9' key (WXYZ)\n*   R is on the '7' key (PQRS)\n\nThus, the numerical value `S` is 76997.\n\nThe problem is set in a triangle ABC with the following known values:\n*   Side `BC = a = 76997`\n*   Angle `B = 30째`\n\nWe are asked to find the number of integer values for the side `AC` (let's call it `b`) for which there are two possible values for the side `AB`. This scenario is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines (SSA).\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles, and therefore two possible lengths for side `AB`, the length of the side opposite the given angle (`AC` or `b`) must be greater than the triangle's altitude from vertex C, but less than the other given side (`BC` or `a`).\n\nThe altitude `h` from vertex C to the side `AB` can be calculated as:\n`h = a * sin(B)`\n\nGiven `a = 76997` and `B = 30째`:\n`h = 76997 * sin(30째)`\nSince `sin(30째) = 0.5`,\n`h = 76997 * 0.5 = 38498.5`\n\nThe condition for two possible triangles is `h < b < a`.\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n`38498.5 < AC < 76997`\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values `AC` can take. The possible integer values for `AC` must be greater than 38498.5 and less than 76997.\n*   The smallest integer value `AC` can be is 38499.\n*   The largest integer value `AC` can be is 76996.\n\nTo find the total number of integer values in this range, we calculate:\nNumber of integers = (Last integer) - (First integer) + 1\nNumber of integers = 76996 - 38499 + 1\nNumber of integers = 38497 + 1\nNumber of integers = 38498\n\nTherefore, there are 38,498 possible integer values for the side length AC.\n\n<<<38498>>>"
