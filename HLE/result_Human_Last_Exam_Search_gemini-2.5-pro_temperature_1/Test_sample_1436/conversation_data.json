    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a combinatorial number that accounts for the overcounting of identical diagrams in the perturbative expansion of Green's functions. For a diagram with two vertices and four field contractions, which typically represents two vertices connected by four internal propagators in a $\\phi^4$-type theory, the symmetry factor is calculated by considering the permutations of its components that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\nThe calculation for this specific diagram involves two sources of symmetry:\n\n1.  **Vertex Permutations:** The diagram contains two identical vertices. These vertices can be interchanged without altering the structure of the diagram. This symmetry contributes a factor of 2! = 2.\n2.  **Propagator Permutations:** The two vertices are connected by four identical propagators (lines). These four lines can be permuted among themselves in 4! ways, and the diagram will remain the same. This contributes a factor of 4! = 24.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of the factors from each type of symmetry operation.\n\nS = (Vertex Permutation Factor) × (Propagator Permutation Factor)\nS = 2 × 24 = 48\n\nThis can also be derived by considering the factors that arise during the Wick contraction process in the perturbative expansion. The term in the expansion corresponding to this vacuum diagram is proportional to $\\frac{1}{2!} (\\frac{\\lambda}{4!})^2$. The number of ways to form four propagators connecting the two vertices is 4!. The overall numerical factor in front of the diagram's integral is therefore $\\frac{1}{2!} \\frac{4!}{(4!)^2} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 4!} = \\frac{1}{48}$. The symmetry factor is the inverse of this numerical combinatorial factor.\n\n<<<48>>>"
