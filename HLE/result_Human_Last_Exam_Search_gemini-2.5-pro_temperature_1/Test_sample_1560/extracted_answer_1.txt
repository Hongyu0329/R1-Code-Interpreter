The final state of the system after measurement is probabilistic and depends on the measurement outcome. If the gate Q is applied to ququint A of the entangled pair, and then a measurement is performed on ququint A, the possible final states and their probabilities are:
*   With a probability of 1/5, the final state is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
*   With a probability of 1/5, the final state is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
*   With a probability of 3/10, the final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
*   With a probability of 1/5, the final state is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
*   With a probability of 1/10, the final state is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
