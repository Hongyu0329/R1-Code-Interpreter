    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the 8-point sequence `{x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the sequences x(n) and h(n) from their DFTs.**\n    We are given the 4-point DFTs `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` and `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`. We find the corresponding time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)` using the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT):\n    `s(n) = (1/N) * Σ[k=0 to N-1] S(k) * exp(j * 2 * π * k * n / N)`\n\n    For `x(n)`:\n    *   `x(0) = (1/4) * (1 + j - 1 - j) = 0`\n    *   `x(1) = (1/4) * (1 + j*e^(jπ/2) - 1*e^(jπ) - j*e^(j3π/2)) = (1/4) * (1 - 1 + 1 - 1) = 0`\n    *   `x(2) = (1/4) * (1 + j*e^(jπ) - 1*e^(j2π) - j*e^(j3π)) = (1/4) * (1 - j - 1 + j) = 0`\n    *   `x(3) = (1/4) * (1 + j*e^(j3π/2) - 1*e^(j3π) - j*e^(j9π/2)) = (1/4) * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 1`\n    So, `x(n) = {0, 0, 0, 1}`.\n\n    For `h(n)`:\n    *   `h(0) = (1/4) * (0 + 1+j + 1 + 1-j) = 3/4`\n    *   `h(1) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)e^(jπ/2) + 1*e^(jπ) + (1-j)e^(j3π/2)) = (1/4) * (j-1 - 1 + j+1) = (2j-1)/4`\n    *   `h(2) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)e^(jπ) + 1*e^(j2π) + (1-j)e^(j3π)) = (1/4) * (-1-j + 1 -1+j) = -1/4`\n    *   `h(3) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)e^(j3π/2) + 1*e^(j3π) + (1-j)e^(j9π/2)) = (1/4) * (-j+1 -1 +j+1) = 1/4`\n    So, `h(n) = {3/4, (2j-1)/4, -1/4, 1/4}`.\n\n2.  **Construct the 8-point sequence.**\n    The sequence is `y(n) = {x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`.\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    `y(n) = {0, 3/4, 0, (2j-1)/4, 0, -1/4, 1, 1/4}`.\n\n3.  **Create a 4-point sequence using time-aliasing.**\n    To find the 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence, we perform time-aliasing. We create a new 4-point sequence `z(n)` by adding the second half of `y(n)` to its first half:\n    `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = 0 + 0 = 0`\n    *   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = 3/4 + (-1/4) = 1/2`\n    *   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    *   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = (2j-1)/4 + 1/4 = 2j/4 = j/2`\n    So, `z(n) = {0, 1/2, 1, j/2}`.\n\n4.  **Compute the 4-point DFT of the aliased sequence.**\n    Finally, we compute the DFT of `z(n)`, which we'll call `Z(k)`.\n    `Z(k) = Σ[n=0 to 3] z(n) * exp(-j * 2 * π * k * n / 4)`.\n    *   `Z(0) = 0 + 1/2 + 1 + j/2 = 1.5 + 0.5j`\n    *   `Z(1) = 0 + (1/2)(-j) - 1 + (j/2)(j) = -1 - j/2 - 1/2 = -1.5 - 0.5j`\n    *   `Z(2) = 0 - 1/2 + 1 - j/2 = 0.5 - 0.5j`\n    *   `Z(3) = 0 + (1/2)(j) - 1 - (j/2)(j) = -1 + j/2 + 1/2 = -0.5 + 0.5j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is `{1.5 + 0.5j, -1.5 - 0.5j, 0.5 - 0.5j, -0.5 + 0.5j}`.\n\n<<<{1.5 + 0.5j, -1.5 - 0.5j, 0.5 - 0.5j, -0.5 + 0.5j}>>>"
