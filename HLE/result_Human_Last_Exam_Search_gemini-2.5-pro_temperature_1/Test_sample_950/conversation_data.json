    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the mathematical definition of the rank of an abelian group. Here is a detailed explanation:\n\n1.  **The Space and its Cohomology Ring:** The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is the direct sum of its integral cohomology groups in each degree.\n\n2.  **Torsion Subgroup:** The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. The integral cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, as an abelian group, has a torsion subgroup, which is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. It is a known, albeit non-trivial, result that the cohomology of this space contains non-trivial torsion elements.\n\n3.  **Rank of an Abelian Group:** The rank of an abelian group, also known as its torsion-free rank, is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset of the group. An equivalent and more concrete definition is that the rank of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring $A$ with the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n4.  **Rank of a Torsion Subgroup:** Let $T$ be the torsion subgroup in question. By definition, every element in a torsion group has a finite order. For any element $x \\in T$, there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $nx = 0$. When we tensor this group with $\\mathbb{Q}$, any element $x \\otimes q$ (where $x \\in T, q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$) becomes zero. This is because we can write $x \\otimes q = x \\otimes (n \\cdot q/n) = (nx) \\otimes (q/n) = 0 \\otimes (q/n) = 0$. Therefore, the tensor product $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is the zero vector space, which has a dimension of 0.\n\nConsequently, abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the torsion abelian groups. Since the torsion subgroup is, by definition, a torsion group, its rank is 0. This holds true for any torsion group, regardless of its specific structure. Although the detailed calculation of the torsion subgroup of $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is complex, its rank is definitively 0 by definition.\n\n<<<0>>>"
