    "Of the rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, the three longest with real-world counterparts are the Tiber, the Styx, and the Acheron. These rivers are a mix of terrestrial waterways and rivers of the Greek underworld, which also have existing namesakes.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Tiber River**, flowing through Rome, Italy. The Tiber is approximately 405 kilometers (252 miles) long. In the *Aeneid*, the Tiber is a significant river, as it is on its banks that Aeneas is destined to found the city that will become Rome.\n\nThe second longest is the **Styx River**. While the mythological Styx is a major river in the underworld, there is a real-world Styx River in Alabama, USA, which is 66.5 kilometers (41.3 miles) long. In the *Aeneid*, the Styx is a formidable river of the underworld that souls must cross.\n\nThe third longest is the **Acheron River**, another river of the underworld that also has a real-world counterpart in the Epirus region of northwestern Greece. This river is 52 kilometers (32 miles) long. The *Aeneid* depicts the Acheron as a river the dead are ferried across.\n\nOther rivers mentioned in the *Aeneid*, such as the Phlegethon, Cocytus, and Lethe, are primarily mythological rivers of the underworld. While there are real rivers named Lethe in Germany and Alaska, they are shorter than the Tiber, Styx, and Acheron. The Phlegethon and Cocytus do not have formally recognized real-world rivers of the same name with established lengths.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid with real-world counterparts are the Tiber, the Styx, and the Acheron.>>>"
