Within the context of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs), the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections for a fixed primary input variable `x'` and a secondary input variable `u`, using Gaussian-based paradigms, is given by a pair of functions that define the upper and lower bounds of an Interval Type-2 (IT2) membership function.

The **Upper Membership Function (UMF)** is defined as:
`μ¯_Ã(x')(u) = exp[- (1/2) * ((u - c_u(x')) / σ_u)²]`

The **Lower Membership Function (LMF)** is defined as:
`μ_Ã(x')(u) = s_u * exp[- (1/2) * ((u - c_u(x')) / σ_u)²]`

where:
- `x'` is the fixed value of the primary input variable.
- `u` is the secondary input variable.
- `μ¯_Ã(x')(u)` and `μ_Ã(x')(u)` are the upper and lower membership grades, respectively, for a given `u` at the fixed `x'`.
- `c_u(x')` is the mean (center) of the Gaussian function for the secondary variable `u`, which may be a function of the primary variable `x'`.
- `σ_u` is the standard deviation (width) of the Gaussian function for the secondary variable `u`.
- `s_u` is a scaling parameter `(0 ≤ s_u ≤ 1)` that determines the height of the lower membership function relative to the upper one.

This formulation establishes the uncertainty bounds for the secondary variable `u` as an interval `[μ_Ã(x')(u), μ¯_Ã(x')(u)]`, where the vertical cross-section itself constitutes an IT2 MF.
