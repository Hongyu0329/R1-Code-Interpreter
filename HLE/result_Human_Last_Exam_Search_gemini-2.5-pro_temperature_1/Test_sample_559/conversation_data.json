    "To find the separatrix of the system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$). A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides regions of qualitatively different behavior, and these are typically associated with saddle points and their stable and unstable manifolds.\n\nThe given system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe find the equilibrium points by setting both derivatives to zero.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting into the first equation: $d' = 2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting into the first equation: $d' = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability of these points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the linearization is inconclusive. However, by analyzing the vector field near the origin, we can see that for any small $u > 0$, $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$, which means trajectories just above the d-axis move towards it. The line $u=0$ is an invariant manifold that attracts nearby trajectories from the upper half-plane.\n\n*   **At (0, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, the point (0, 1) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the point (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n**3. The Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point, as these curves divide the phase plane into regions with distinct long-term behavior.\n\n*   **Stable Manifold of the Saddle Point (-1, 1):**\n    The stable manifold corresponds to the negative eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1 = -2$. The associated eigenvector is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v = 0$, which gives the eigenvector $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This vector is horizontal, indicating that the stable manifold lies along the line $u=1$. Trajectories on the line $u=1$ (for $d \\neq -1$) converge to the saddle point. This line separates the phase plane into a region where $u$ increases ($u>1$) and a region where $u$ decreases ($0 \\le u < 1$).\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold of the Saddle Point (-1, 1):**\n    The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2 = 1$. The associated eigenvector is $v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold consists of two trajectories that leave the saddle point in the direction of this eigenvector. These trajectories act as a dividing line for the ultimate fate of other trajectories in the system.\n\nIn summary, the separatrix for the system in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$) is composed of the saddle point at $(-1, 1)$ and its associated stable and unstable manifolds.\n\n<<<The separatrix of the system is the union of the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at $(-1, 1)$. Specifically, this consists of the line $u=1$ (which is the stable manifold) and the two trajectories that constitute the unstable manifold leaving the point $(-1, 1)$. The invariant line $u=0$ also acts as a boundary for the system's behavior in the specified domain."
