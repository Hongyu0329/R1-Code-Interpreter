The separatrix of the system is the union of the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at $(-1, 1)$. Specifically, this consists of the line $u=1$ (which is the stable manifold) and the two trajectories that constitute the unstable manifold leaving the point $(-1, 1)$. The invariant line $u=0$ also acts as a boundary for the system's behavior in the specified domain.
