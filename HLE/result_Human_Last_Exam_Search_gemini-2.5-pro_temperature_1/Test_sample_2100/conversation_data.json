    "Andrei Voznesensky's poem \"Avos!\", which later became the basis for the renowned rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" immortalized the story of the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. In the libretto, Voznesensky indeed refers to him as a \"joy-discovering sailor\" and contemplates the mystery of his final resting place.\n\nRezanov was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and a leader of the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth. During an expedition to California in 1806 to secure provisions for Russian colonies in Alaska, he met and fell in love with María de la Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish commandant of San Francisco.\n\nAfter their engagement, Rezanov began the arduous journey back to St. Petersburg to seek permission from the Tsar to marry a Catholic. However, he fell ill along the way and died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in March 1807. He was buried at the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n\nThe question of his grave's location, as the poem wondered, became a real historical puzzle. In the 1930s, the original monument was destroyed, and in the 1960s, the cathedral itself was demolished, and the cemetery was lost. While a decision to move his remains was reportedly made in the late 1950s, the exact location of the reburial became uncertain. It was through the persistent efforts of local Krasnoyarsk historian Olga Arzhanykh in the latter half of the 20th century that the story of the reinterment at the Trinity cemetery was pieced together, with the answer truly solidifying for the public by the late 1980s and early 1990s, culminating in the installation of a new monument.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
