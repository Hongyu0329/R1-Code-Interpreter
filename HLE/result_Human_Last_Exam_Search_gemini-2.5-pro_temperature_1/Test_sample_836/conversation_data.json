    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, often denoted as G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. It provides information about the spatial and temporal correlations between particles in a system.\n\nIts double Fourier transform with respect to space and time yields the dynamic structure factor, S(q, ω). This function is crucial as it directly relates the microscopic particle correlations to experimental observables. Specifically, the dynamic structure factor is proportional to the double differential scattering cross-section, d²σ/dΩdE, which is a fundamental quantity measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments.\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality safety, the dynamic structure factor, often represented as the thermal scattering law S(α, β) in nuclear data libraries, is essential for accurately modeling the moderation of neutrons in materials. This information is vital for the correct calculation of neutron transport and effective multiplication factor (k-eff) in nuclear systems. The function that is the precursor to this transform is also known as the Van Hove function.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
