    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are on the same side of the ring (cis). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered base, which strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reaction**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. For the elimination to occur on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar, or trans-diaxial, conformation. This means both must be in axial positions, with one pointing up and the other down.\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis**:\n    *   The starting molecule, cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, exists in two chair conformations that are in equilibrium.\n    *   In the more stable conformation, the bulky methyl and bromo groups both occupy equatorial positions to minimize steric strain. However, in this conformation, the axial bromine required for the E2 reaction is absent.\n    *   For the reaction to proceed, the molecule must flip into its less stable chair conformation. In this less stable conformer, both the bromo and methyl groups are forced into axial positions.\n\n4.  **Identification of the Abstracted Hydrogen**:\n    *   With the bromine atom now in an axial position, the base will abstract an anti-periplanar β-hydrogen.\n    *   Let's examine the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6):\n        *   **At C2**: This carbon has the axial methyl group. The hydrogen on C2 is therefore in an equatorial position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so elimination involving this hydrogen is not possible.\n        *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and the other is equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n    *   Consequently, the tert-butoxide base can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n5.  **Product Formation**:\n    *   The removal of the hydrogen from C6 and the bromine from C1 results in the formation of a double bond between these two carbons.\n    *   The methyl group on C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of how stereochemistry dictates the regiochemical outcome of an E2 reaction, leading to the formation of the less substituted (anti-Zaitsev) product, 3-methylcyclohexene, instead of the more substituted and typically more stable 1-methylcyclohexene (Zaitsev product).\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
