    "Due to the lack of available video evidence of the specified performance and the absence of a universally recognized definition for the ballet step \"pas de Balanchine,\" it is not possible to determine the exact number of times Svetlana Gileva performed this step in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nSvetlana Gileva was a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett and performed in this role during the 2015 season. While video titles from the Semperoper Ballett's official YouTube channel from November 2015 confirm Gileva's performance in the \"Jete Woman solo,\" the content is no longer available.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" does not refer to a standardized step in the official ballet lexicon. Online tutorials and discussions present conflicting descriptions, with some equating it to a \"pas de chat\" with a stretched leg, while others describe it as a \"balanc√©,\" a three-count waltz step.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreographic style is known for its deconstruction of classical ballet, pushing the vocabulary to its extremes in terms of speed and lines. Forsythe himself has stated that he uses classical ballet steps as an \"alphabet\" which he then reconfigures. This suggests that while recognizable classical movements may be present, they are often manipulated and might not be easily classifiable under traditional terminology.\n\nWithout a visual record of the performance, a definitive count of any specific step remains impossible. Reviews and descriptions of the ballet and Forsythe's work discuss the overall style and aesthetic but do not provide a detailed choreographic breakdown of individual solos.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question as the video of the performance is unavailable and there is no standard definition for a \"pas de Balanchine.\" Therefore, I cannot count the number of times the step was performed.>>>"
