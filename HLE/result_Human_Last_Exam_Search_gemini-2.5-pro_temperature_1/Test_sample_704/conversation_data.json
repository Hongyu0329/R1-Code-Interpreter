    "In Isaac Newton's theory of correspondences between color and music, the range from green to blue on his color circle is associated with the musical notes F and G.\n\nThe color produced by combining yellow and blue is green. Newton assigned the seven colors of the spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—to the seven notes of a musical scale.\n\nThere are two common versions of this mapping:\n\n*   **One version, based on a C major scale, maps Green to the note F and Blue to the note G**.\n*   **Another interpretation, based on Newton's original work with the Dorian mode, starts the scale on D**. In this arrangement, Red is D, Orange is E, Yellow is F, **Green is G**, and **Blue is A**.\n\nThe question asks for a single musical note for the range \"between\" green and blue. This range encompasses both the green and blue segments of the circle. Depending on the specific scale used for the analogy, this corresponds to:\n\n*   **F and G** in the C major scale analogy.\n*   **G and A** in the Dorian mode analogy.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the phrasing \"a musical note\" for a range covering two colors and the existence of multiple mappings, the most accurate answer includes the notes for both colors that define the range. The note corresponding to the start of the specified range (Green) is F in the more common modern interpretation and G in Newton's original modal system.\n\n<<<F and G>>>"
