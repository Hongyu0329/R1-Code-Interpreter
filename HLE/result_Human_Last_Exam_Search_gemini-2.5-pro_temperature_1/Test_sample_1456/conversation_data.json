    "The largest possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by **c** or **2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Continuum and Composants:** A continuum is a compact and connected metric space. A composant of a point within a continuum is a specific type of subset containing that point. The collection of all disjoint composants forms a partition of the entire continuum.\n\n*   **Number of Composants of a Single Continuum:** The number of composants a nondegenerate continuum can have can be a finite integer (1, 2, 3,...), countably infinite (ℵ₀), or equal to the cardinality of the continuum (c). It has been shown that for any of these numbers, there exists a continuum with that many composants. The maximum number of composants a single continuum can possess is **c**. A well-known example of a continuum with **c** composants is the topologist's sine curve.\n\n*   **Composants of a Product of Continua:** A key theorem in continuum theory states that the set of composants of the product of two continua, X and Y, is the Cartesian product of their respective sets of composants. Consequently, the number of composants of the product space X × Y is the product of the number of composants of X and the number of composants of Y.\n\n*   **Maximizing the Number of Composants:** To find the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua, we must maximize the number of composants for each continuum. Since the maximum number of composants for a single continuum is **c**, we consider two such continua, X and Y, each with **c** composants.\n\nThe number of composants of their product, X × Y, would then be c × c. Based on the rules of cardinal arithmetic, c × c = c.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
