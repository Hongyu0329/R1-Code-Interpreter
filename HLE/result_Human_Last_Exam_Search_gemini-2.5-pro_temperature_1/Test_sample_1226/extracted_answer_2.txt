A definitive record for the greatest number of points of white material in a mate-in-6 problem is not publicly available through general search but is a known category of "task and record" chess compositions. The solution would involve a large number of queens, likely in the range of 10 to 15, creating a point value of 90 to 135. The exact record is likely documented in specialized chess problem literature, such as "Chess Problems: Tasks and Records" by Jeremy Morse.
