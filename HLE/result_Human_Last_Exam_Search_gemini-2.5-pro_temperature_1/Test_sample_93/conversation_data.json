    "The initial search has provided some general information about sums of five squares. It confirms that all sufficiently large integers can be expressed as a sum of five squares. It also introduced `r_k(n)`, the number of representations of `n` as the sum of `k` squares, which considers order and signs. The search also brought up Jacobi's formulas for the sum of two and four squares. However, a direct formula for the sum of five squares, especially for non-negative integer solutions, is not yet found. The next step should focus on finding a formula or method to calculate the number of representations of an integer as a sum of five squares.The previous searches have established that a formula for `r_5(n)`, the number of ways to represent `n` as a sum of five integer squares (including zeros and considering order and signs), does exist and was found by Eisenstein, Smith, and Minkowski. However, the explicit formula is not readily available in the initial results. The problem asks for the number of *non-negative* integer solutions, which is related to `r_5(n)`. To proceed, I need to find the explicit formula for `r_5(n)`. Once I have this formula, I will need to understand its components and how to apply it to the specific number 2024. Finally, I will need to relate `r_5(n)` (which includes positive, negative, and zero integers) to the number of non-negative integer solutions. This may involve accounting for the signs and the presence of zeros in the solutions.The searches have confirmed that a formula for `r_5(n)`, the number of integer solutions (including positive, negative, and zero) for the sum of five squares, was developed by Eisenstein, Smith, and Minkowski. While the explicit formula is complex and involves modular forms, a more accessible version for numbers not divisible by any square other than 1 was mentioned. The key next step is to find a practical, explicit formula for `r_5(n)` that can be used for calculation. Previous attempts did not yield a direct, usable formula. I will refine my search to find the explicit arithmetic formula for `r_5(n)`. Once found, I will need to understand its terms, especially how they relate to the prime factorization of `n`. Then, I will apply this formula to `n = 2024`. Finally, I will need to determine the relationship between `r_5(2024)` (which counts all integer solutions) and the number of non-negative integer solutions, which is the target of the user's question. This last step will likely involve considering the permutations of non-zero elements and the signs, and how solutions with zero components are counted.The search results confirm that a formula for `r_5(n)`, the number of ways to represent an integer `n` as the sum of five squares (counting order and signs), was established by Eisenstein and later by Smith and Minkowski. However, a readily applicable, explicit arithmetic formula for `r_5(n)` for any integer `n` is not directly provided in the search results. The results allude to its complexity, often involving advanced concepts like modular forms. Without this explicit formula, directly calculating `r_5(2024)` is not feasible with the current information.\n\nSince finding the general explicit formula for `r_5(n)` is proving difficult, a more direct approach is needed. I will now try to find a direct calculation or a known result for `r_5(2024)` or a method to compute it without the general formula. I will also search for how to convert the number of all integer solutions (with signs and order) to the number of non-negative integer solutions, as this is a crucial step to answer the user's question.\n\nMy next steps will be:\n1. Search for the specific value of `r_5(2024)`.\n2. Search for a method to compute `r_5(n)` for a specific `n` without needing the general explicit formula. This might involve computational tools or specific properties of the number 2024.\n3. Search for a detailed explanation of how to derive the number of non-negative integer solutions for a sum of squares equation from the total number of integer solutions (`r_k(n)`). This will involve understanding how to handle permutations of the same absolute values and the signs of the integers, and how to account for solutions containing zeros.\n\nBased on these steps, I will generate new search queries.I have not been able to find a direct, easily applicable arithmetic formula for `r_5(n)`. The search results consistently point out that the formula is complex and related to advanced mathematical concepts. I also haven't found a pre-computed value for `r_5(2024)`. However, the search results do provide information on how the number of representations as a sum of squares, `r_k(n)`, is defined (counting order and signs of integers) and give formulas for `k=2` and `k=4`. There is also information on how to find the number of non-negative integer solutions for linear Diophantine equations and for the sum of two squares, which gives a methodological hint.\n\nGiven the difficulty in finding a direct formula for `r_5(2024)`, I will pivot my strategy. I will use a computational approach to find the number of non-negative integer solutions. This will involve the following steps:\n1.  Determine the possible range for the integer variables `x_i`. Since their squares must sum to 2024, each `x_i` must be between 0 and `sqrt(2024)`.\n2.  Write a program to iterate through all possible combinations of five non-negative integers within this range and count the combinations that satisfy the equation.\n\nThis approach is feasible as the upper bound for each variable is not excessively large. After obtaining the number of solutions through computation, I will present this as the final answer. This avoids the need for the complex explicit formula for `r_5(n)`.\n\nFirst, I will calculate the integer part of the square root of 2024 to set the bounds for the loops.\nThen, I will construct and execute the Python code to find the number of solutions.\nFinally, I will output the result obtained from the code as the answer.\n\nI will start by calculating the square root of 2024.\nI have determined that the integer part of the square root of 2024 is 44. This sets the upper limit for the values of the non-negative integers \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\). Now, I will proceed with the computational approach to find the number of solutions.\n\nI will write and execute a Python script to iterate through all possible combinations of five non-negative integers from 0 to 44. For each combination, it will check if the sum of their squares equals 2024. The script will count the number of such combinations. This will give the exact number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Implement a nested loop structure in Python, with five levels of nesting for the five variables.\n2.  The loops will iterate from 0 to 44.\n3.  Inside the innermost loop, an `if` condition will check if the sum of the squares of the five loop variables is equal to 2024.\n4.  A counter variable will be incremented every time the condition is met.\n5.  After the loops complete, the final value of the counter will be the answer.\nTo avoid overcounting, I will enforce an ordering on the variables, such as \\(x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0\\). After finding the number of these ordered solutions, I will need to account for all possible permutations of the distinct values in each solution to get the total number of solutions.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward computational approach is to find all unique tuples `(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)` where the elements are sorted, and then for each unique tuple, calculate the number of unique permutations. A `set` in Python is a suitable data structure to store the unique sorted tuples.\n\nI will now write the python code to find these unique sorted tuples and then calculate the total number of solutions by considering permutations. This will provide the final answer."
