The best choice of the pair $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is the set containing the following two values:
$\{\frac{4(\kappa+1) - 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1}, \frac{4(\kappa+1) + 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1}\}$
The order of the two step sizes does not matter for the uniform performance guarantee.
