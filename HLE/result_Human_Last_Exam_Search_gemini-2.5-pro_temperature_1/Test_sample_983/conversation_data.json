    "Based on an analysis of the provided number sequence, all the numbers are divisible by 6. A comprehensive list of four-digit numbers divisible by 6 confirms that the given numbers are a subsequence of these multiples. For instance, the sequence starts with 1014 and 1020, which are consecutive multiples of 6 with a difference of 6. However, the next number is 1032, with a difference of 12, skipping the multiple 1026. This pattern of skipping multiples of 6 continues throughout the sequence with no readily discernible mathematical rule governing the gaps.\n\nThe differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence are: 6, 12, 18, 54, 120, 6, 60, 120, 30, 12, 30, 18, 12, 48, 24, 18, 132, 78, 78, 12, 30, 42, 30, 36, 24, 6, 60, 12, 132, 66, 12. This sequence of differences does not appear to follow any simple arithmetic or geometric progression.\n\nSearches for this specific sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and broader web searches did not identify a known mathematical sequence. The search results did, however, uncover various technical documents and databases where similar number sequences appear as identifiers, barcodes, or technical codes rather than as a mathematically generated sequence.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear mathematical pattern, it is highly probable that the sequence is derived from a specific, non-mathematical context that is not publicly accessible. Without this context, it is not possible to definitively determine the next number.\n\nHowever, if a prediction must be made based on the available information, the most straightforward approach is to assume the simplest possible continuation. The most fundamental property of the sequence is that all its members are multiples of 6. The last term provided is 2352. The next multiple of 6 after 2352 is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
