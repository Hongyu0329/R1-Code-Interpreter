    "The haiku's riddle is solved by identifying the historical event it describes and then finding the \"Bays\" associated with it.\n\nFirst, let's decipher the haiku:\n*   **\"An August tempest\"** refers to the tumultuous end of World War II in the Pacific, specifically the atomic bombings of Japan in August 1945.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"** points to August 30, 1945. \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty. On this day, General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to oversee the formal surrender and occupation, a significant \"wind of change.\"\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"** alludes to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito, who was considered a divine figure by his people. His announcement of Japan's surrender was a pivotal moment.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is a question, and the answer is a list of bays relevant to this event. An armada of over 300 Allied ships gathered in and around Tokyo Bay for the surrender ceremony on September 2, 1945. Among them were several ships with \"Bay\" in their names.\n\nBased on the lists of Allied ships present in Tokyo Bay for the surrender, the following \"Bays\" were in attendance:\n*   USS Gardiners Bay (AVP-39)\n*   USS Salamaua (CVE-96)\n*   USS Suisun (AVP-53)\n\nPutting these in alphabetical order provides the answer.\n\n<<<Gardiners Bay, Salamaua, Suisun>>>"
