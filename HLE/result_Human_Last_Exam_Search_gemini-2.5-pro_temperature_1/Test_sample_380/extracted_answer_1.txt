Your understanding that the components perpendicular to the local magnetic field should be used is correct, and this is indeed the standard scientific practice. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial, but follows the Parker spiral. Calculations of normalized magnetic helicity are performed in a coordinate system defined by the local magnetic field, not a fixed radial direction.
