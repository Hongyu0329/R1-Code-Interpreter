    "The thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2 with respect to the valuation $v$ normalized to $v(2)=1$ is 2.\n\nThis is a technical question in arithmetic geometry. The \"thickness\" of a double point in the special fiber of a semistable model of a curve is an integer that measures the extent of the singularity. For a double point locally described by an equation $uv = \\pi^n$ (where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the valuation ring), the thickness is the integer $n$.\n\nRecent research in the field provides a direct answer. According to a 2024 paper on the reduction of hyperelliptic curves in residue characteristic 2, the curve given by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ has a stable marked reduction of a specific type denoted as (A2). The paper further specifies that for this type of reduction, the thickness of the double point is 2.\n\nThe computation of this value generally involves a detailed analysis of the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$, a process known as creating a \"cluster picture\", which is particularly complex in residue characteristic 2. This analysis leads to the determination of the structure of the stable model and its invariants, like the thickness of its singular points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
