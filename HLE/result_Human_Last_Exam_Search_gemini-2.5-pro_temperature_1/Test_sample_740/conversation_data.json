    "The given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$, for $0 \\le x \\le 1$.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$, is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. It can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and y. Specifically, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the kernel is:\n$K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$\n\nThis form of the kernel implies that the solution $u(x)$, if it exists, must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Let's assume the solution is of the form:\n$u(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i x^i$\n\nSubstituting this into the integral equation and equating the coefficients of the powers of $x$ leads to a system of $n$ linear equations for the coefficients $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}$. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n$(I - \\lambda A^T) \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{e}_0$\nwhere:\n*   $\\mathbf{a}$ is the column vector of coefficients $[a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}]^T$.\n*   $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n*   $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k = 0, \\dots, n-1$.\n*   $A^T$ is the transpose of A.\n*   $\\mathbf{e}_0$ is the standard basis vector $[1, 0, \\dots, 0]^T$.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem for linear systems, this equation has a unique solution for $\\mathbf{a}$ if the matrix $(I - \\lambda A^T)$ is invertible. If the matrix is not invertible, a solution exists only if the right-hand side, $\\mathbf{e}_0$, is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix, which is $(I - \\lambda A^T)^T = (I - \\lambda A)$.\n\nThe equation has no solutions if:\n1.  $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A^T$ (and therefore also of $A$). Let's call this eigenvalue $\\mu$.\n2.  The vector $\\mathbf{e}_0$ is not orthogonal to the null space of $(I - \\lambda A)$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{w}$ be an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$. The second condition for no solution becomes $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{e}_0 \\neq 0$. This is equivalent to stating that the first component of the eigenvector $\\mathbf{w}$, denoted as $w_0$, must be non-zero.\n\nIt can be shown that for the matrix $A$ in question, none of its eigenvectors have a first component equal to zero. This means that for any characteristic value $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, the condition for the existence of a solution is not met.\n\nTherefore, the given integral equation has no solutions for any value of $\\lambda$ that is a reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n\nThe specific values of $\\lambda$ depend on the integer $n$:\n\n*   **For n = 1:** The matrix is $A =$. The only eigenvalue is $\\mu=1$. Thus, the equation has no solution for $\\lambda = 1/1 = 1$.\n*   **For n = 2:** The matrix is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. The values of $\\lambda$ for which there is no solution are $\\lambda = 1/\\mu = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor a general integer $n$, the values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ defined by:\n$A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$, for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A, where the entries are given by $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$."
