    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the steam tanker **Brumaire**.\n\nThe \"Brumaire,\" with a tonnage of 7,638 tons, was part of a small convoy when it was torpedoed by the German U-boat U-25 on June 19, 1940. The damaged vessel was subsequently sunk by German aircraft the following day, on June 20, 1940, off Belle-ÃŽle.\n\nSeveral other French ships were sunk by U-boats in the period leading up to the armistice. The steam tanker \"Monique,\" at 7,011 tons, was sunk by U-65 on June 22, 1940, just hours before the armistice was signed. Another vessel, the steam merchant \"Louisiane\" (6,903 tons), was sunk by U-48 on October 13, 1939. The French submarine \"Doris\" (525/765 tons) was also a casualty, sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940. However, the \"Brumaire\" stands as the largest of these losses.\n\nThe armistice between France and Germany was signed on June 22, 1940, at 18:36, and the ceasefire became effective on June 25, 1940. Therefore, the sinking of the \"Brumaire\" falls within the specified timeframe.\n\n<<<Brumaire>>>"
