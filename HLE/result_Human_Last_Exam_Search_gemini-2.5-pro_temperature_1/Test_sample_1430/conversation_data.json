    "Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3 and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as Sym¹⁵(C). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, also known as the Picard number ρ(X), depends on the specific choice of the curve C. We can determine the smallest and largest possible values for this rank.\n\n### Structure of the Néron-Severi Group of Sym¹⁵(C)\n\nFor a smooth projective curve C of genus g, and an integer d, the d-th symmetric power Symᵈ(C) is a smooth projective variety of dimension d. When d ≥ 2g - 1, the structure of the Picard group of Symᵈ(C) is well-understood. In this case, g=3 and d=15, so the condition 15 ≥ 2(3) - 1 = 5 is satisfied.\n\nFor d ≥ 2g - 1, the Albanese map from Symᵈ(C) to the Jacobian variety Jac(C) of the curve is a fiber bundle with the fiber being a projective space of dimension d-g. This leads to a decomposition of the Néron-Severi group. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of Symᵈ(C) is given by the formula:\n\nρ(Symᵈ(C)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1\n\nHere, ρ(Jac(C)) is the Picard number of the Jacobian of C. Therefore, to find the minimum and maximum rank for X = Sym¹⁵(C), we need to find the minimum and maximum Picard number for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe Picard number of the Jacobian of a \"generic\" algebraic curve of genus g ≥ 2 is 1. This is because the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian of a generic curve is just the integers **Z**, and for an abelian variety, this implies the Néron-Severi group has rank 1. Since the moduli space of genus 3 curves is 6-dimensional and maps dominantly to the moduli space of 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian varieties, a generic curve has a generic Jacobian.\n\nThus, the minimum possible value for ρ(Jac(C)) is 1.\n\nThe smallest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nmin ρ(X) = min ρ(Jac(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nDetermining the maximum Picard number for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve requires identifying a special curve whose Jacobian has a large endomorphism ring, which leads to a higher-rank Néron-Severi group. The upper bound for the Picard number of a g-dimensional abelian variety is h¹﹐¹ = g², which is 9 for g=3.\n\nHowever, for Jacobians of curves of prime genus g > 2, the Picard number is strictly less than g². A recent result by J.C. Naranjo provides a corrected bound for the maximal Picard number of the Jacobian of a curve of prime genus g > 2, which is g² - g + 1. For g=3, this bound is 3² - 3 + 1 = 7.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved for the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ = z⁴. The Jacobian of this curve is known to have complex multiplication and its Néron-Severi group has a rank of 7.\n\nThus, the maximum possible value for ρ(Jac(C)) for a genus 3 curve is 7.\n\nThe largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nmax ρ(X) = max ρ(Jac(C)) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = Sym¹⁵(C) is ρ(X) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1.\n*   The **smallest possible rank** is achieved for a generic curve C, where ρ(Jac(C)) = 1, giving **ρ(X) = 2**.\n*   The **largest possible rank** is achieved for the Fermat quartic curve, where ρ(Jac(C)) = 7, giving **ρ(X) = 8**.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 8.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest is 8.>>>"
