    "To find the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we first need to determine the Galois group of the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The splitting field of this polynomial is $K$.\n\n### Step 1: Factor the polynomial\nFirst, we try to factor the polynomial $P(x)$. By rearranging the terms, we can find a factorization:\n$P(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, factoring into $P_1(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $P_2(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Galois groups of the factors\nThe splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $P_1(x)$ and $P_2(x)$. Let $K_1$ be the splitting field of $P_1(x)$ and $K_2$ be the splitting field of $P_2(x)$. Then $K = K_1 K_2$. Let $G_1 = \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$ and $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n**For $P_2(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\nThe roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group is $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\cong S_2$.\n\n**For $P_1(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n1.  **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, since 3 divides the coefficients -9 and 3, but not the leading coefficient 1, and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3, the polynomial $P_1(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Galois Group:** Since $P_1(x)$ is an irreducible quintic polynomial, its Galois group $G_1$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. The candidates are $C_5$, $D_5$, $F_{20}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n3.  **Discriminant:** The discriminant of a polynomial $x^5+ax+b$ is $D = 256a^5 + 3125b^4$. For $P_1(x)$, $a=-9$ and $b=3$.\n    $D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\n    Since the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G_1$ is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_5$. This eliminates $C_5$, $D_5$ (as its elements acting on roots are in $A_5$ except for reflections), and $A_5$. More formally, the possibilities are narrowed down to $S_5$ or $F_{20}$.\n4.  **Factorization modulo a prime:** Let's consider the factorization of $P_1(x)$ modulo 2:\n    $x^5 - 9x + 3 \\equiv x^5 - x + 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    This polynomial factors over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ as $(x^2+x+1)(x^3+x+1)$. Since it factors into irreducible polynomials of degree 2 and 3, the Galois group must contain a permutation with cycle structure $(2,3)$, which is an element of order 6.\n5.  **Identifying the group:** The possible orders of elements in the transitive subgroups of $S_5$ are:\n    *   $C_5$: {1, 5}\n    *   $D_5$: {1, 2, 5}\n    *   $F_{20}$ (Frobenius group): {1, 2, 4, 5}\n    *   $A_5$: {1, 2, 3, 5}\n    *   $S_5$: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n    The presence of an element of order 6 implies that the Galois group $G_1$ must be $S_5$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the compositum field\nThe Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. It is a subgroup of the direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$. The group $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe field $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2$ is a subfield of $K_2$, so it is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_1$.\nThe subfields of $K_1$ correspond to subgroups of $G_1=S_5$. A quadratic subfield corresponds to a normal subgroup of index 2. The only normal subgroup of $S_5$ is $A_5$, which has index 2. This subfield is unique and is given by $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $P_1(x)$.\nSo, the only quadratic subfield of $K_1$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, the Galois group of $K$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = G_1 \\times G_2 \\cong S_5 \\times S_2$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |S_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the degrees of intermediate normal extensions\nThe intermediate field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to subgroups $H$ of $G$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G:H| = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find the indices of all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times S_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $S_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include products of normal subgroups, but can also include \"diagonal\" subgroups if there are isomorphic quotient groups.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times S_2$ are:\n1.  **Products of normal subgroups:**\n    *   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: The index is $|G|/|A_5 \\times \\{e\\}| = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: The index is $|G|/|S_5 \\times \\{e\\}| = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times S_2$: The index is $|G|/|\\{e\\} \\times S_2| = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $A_5 \\times S_2$: The index is $|G|/|A_5 \\times S_2| = 240/(60 \\times 2) = 2$.\n\n2.  **Diagonal subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of the factors.\n    *   The quotient groups of $S_5$ are $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$, $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$, and $S_5/S_5 \\cong \\{e\\}$.\n    *   The quotient groups of $S_2$ are $S_2/\\{e\\} \\cong S_2 \\cong C_2$, and $S_2/S_2 \\cong \\{e\\}$.\n    *   There is a non-trivial isomorphism $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to S_2/\\{e\\}$. This gives rise to a normal subgroup $N = \\{(g,h) \\in S_5 \\times S_2 \\mid \\phi(gA_5) = h\\}$. This subgroup consists of pairs $(g, e)$ for $g \\in A_5$ and $(g, \\tau)$ for $g \\notin A_5$ (where $\\tau$ is the non-identity element of $S_2$). The order of this subgroup is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    *   The index of this normal subgroup is $|G|/|N| = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nWe are looking for degrees of extensions $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, which corresponds to indices of normal subgroups $H$ where $H \\neq G$ and $H \\neq \\{e\\}$.\n\nThe possible indices are 2, 4, and 120. These are the possible degrees of the intermediate normal field extensions.\n\nThe possible degrees of normal field extensions $L / \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
