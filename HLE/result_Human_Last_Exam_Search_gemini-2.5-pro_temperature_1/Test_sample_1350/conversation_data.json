    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who describes the religious and symbolic practices of the Romans in a way that clearly alludes to Romulus and Remus is an escaped thrall from the House of the Gael. The story of this thrall is recounted by Hiarandi the Elking to Wolfkettle.\n\nWhile traveling to the Folk-thing, Hiarandi explains that a man who had been captured by the Romans and lived among them sought refuge with his people. This man, a Gael, described the Romans' customs and, most notably, their banner. He marveled that the Roman banner depicted \"a she-wolf and two man-children at her dugs\".\n\nThis description is a direct reference to the foundational myth of Rome, in which the city's founders, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, were suckled and cared for by a she-wolf after being abandoned as infants. The thrall's observation serves to characterize the Romans to the Gothic tribes, highlighting their foreign and, to the Goths, peculiar customs. This is particularly striking to the Wolfings, who themselves have a totemic connection to the wolf, presenting a contrast between the two cultures' relationship with the animal.\n\n<<<An escaped thrall of the Gael, whose story is told by Hiarandi the Elking.>>>"
