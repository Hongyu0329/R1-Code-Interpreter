    "An opened single-dose ampule must be used immediately, and any remaining portion should be discarded; it cannot be stored for any period. This is because once a glass ampule is broken open, it becomes an open system that cannot be resealed, making it highly susceptible to contamination.\n\nUnlike single-dose *vials*, which have a rubber stopper that allows for needle puncture and may be used for up to 12 hours if entered in a sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or cleaner), ampules have no such closure system. The guidance from regulatory bodies like the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) is explicit on this point.\n\nTherefore, the beyond-use date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule once it is opened is immediate, regardless of the sterility of the environment in which it was opened.\n\n<<<An opened single-dose ampule must be used immediately and cannot be stored. Any unused portion must be discarded.>>>"
