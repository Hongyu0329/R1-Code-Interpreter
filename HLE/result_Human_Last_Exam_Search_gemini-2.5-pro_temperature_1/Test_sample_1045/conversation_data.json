    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene molecule (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set, we must first calculate the number of functions for each atom (Carbon and Hydrogen) and then sum them according to the molecular formula.\n\n### Basis Functions for Carbon (C)\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. For a second-row atom like carbon:\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):** Are described by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a sum of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (the \"6\" in 6-31G). This gives **1 contracted function**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p):** Are split into two parts.\n    *   An inner part described by a contracted function made from 3 primitive Gaussians (the \"3\" in 6-31G). This includes one s-orbital and three p-orbitals (px, py, pz), for a total of **4 contracted functions**.\n    *   An outer part described by a single primitive Gaussian function (the \"1\" in 6-31G). This also includes one s-orbital and three p-orbitals, for another **4 contracted functions**.\n\nTherefore, each carbon atom uses 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for inner 2s, 2p) + 4 (for outer 2s, 2p) = **9 contracted basis functions**.\n\n### Basis Functions for Hydrogen (H)\nFor a hydrogen atom, there are no core electrons. The 1s valence orbital is split into two parts:\n*   An inner part represented by a contracted function made of 3 primitive Gaussians. This gives **1 contracted function**.\n*   An outer part represented by a single primitive Gaussian. This gives another **1 contracted function**.\n\nThus, each hydrogen atom uses 1 + 1 = **2 contracted basis functions**.\n\n### Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8)\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted functions for the entire molecule:\n*   **For the 7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **For the 8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\n**Total Contracted Gaussian Functions** = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n<<<79>>>"
