    "An analytical approximation for the solution of the given ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the large $x$ regime can be found by analyzing the dominant terms of the equation. The ODE is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\nThe initial conditions are $y(0) = 0.00$, $y'(0) = 3.00$, and $y''(0) = 2.00$.\n\nThe positive initial values for the first and second derivatives, along with a large positive initial value for the third derivative ($y'''(0) = 3^4 - 2/2 + 1/1 = 81$), suggest that the solution will grow rapidly. This type of growth in non-linear ODEs often leads to a singularity at a finite value of $x$, say $x_0$. The \"large $x$\" regime can be interpreted as the behavior of the solution as $x$ approaches this singularity, i.e., $x \\to x_0$.\n\nAs $x \\to x_0$, if the solution's derivatives blow up, the terms involving $y$ and its derivatives are expected to become much larger than the other terms. The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ will become negligible compared to the singular terms, as will the bounded term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$. Therefore, the ODE can be approximated by its most dominant non-linear terms:\n$y''' \\approx y^4 + y'^4$\n\nWe look for a solution of the form $y(x) \\approx A + B(x_0-x)^p$ for constants $A$, $B$, $x_0$, and $p$. For the derivatives to be singular as $x \\to x_0$, $p$ must be such that the derivative exponents are negative.\nLet's determine the dominant balance between the terms $y'''$, $y^4$, and $y'^4$ for this form of solution.\nThe orders of magnitude are:\n*   $y(x) \\sim (x_0-x)^p$\n*   $y'(x) \\sim (x_0-x)^{p-1}$\n*   $y'''(x) \\sim (x_0-x)^{p-3}$\n*   $y^4(x) \\sim (x_0-x)^{4p}$\n*   $y'^4(x) \\sim (x_0-x)^{4p-4}$\n\nThe most singular term (the one with the most negative exponent) will dominate the behavior. A consistent balance requires the two most singular terms to be of the same order of magnitude.\nComparing the exponents:\n*   $(p-3) - (4p-4) = -3p+1$. The exponents are equal if $p=1/3$.\n*   For $p=1/3$, the exponents are:\n    *   $y'''$: $p-3 = 1/3 - 3 = -8/3$\n    *   $y^4$: $4p = 4/3$\n    *   $y'^4$: $4p-4 = 4/3 - 4 = -8/3$\nThe terms $y'''$ and $y'^4$ are dominant as $x \\to x_0$, while the term $y^4$ is subdominant. This gives a consistent dominant balance: $y''' \\approx y'^4$.\n\nNow, we determine the coefficient $B$. Let the approximate solution be $y(x) = A + B(x_0-x)^{1/3}$.\nThe derivatives are:\n*   $y'(x) = -\\frac{B}{3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$\n*   $y''(x) = -\\frac{2B}{9}(x_0-x)^{-5/3}$\n*   $y'''(x) = -\\frac{10B}{27}(x_0-x)^{-8/3}$\n\nThe fourth power of the first derivative is:\n*   $(y'(x))^4 = \\left(-\\frac{B}{3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{B^4}{81}(x_0-x)^{-8/3}$\n\nSubstituting these into the balanced equation $y''' \\approx y'^4$:\n$-\\frac{10B}{27}(x_0-x)^{-8/3} = \\frac{B^4}{81}(x_0-x)^{-8/3}$\n\nAssuming $B \\neq 0$, we can solve for $B$:\n$-\\frac{10}{27} = \\frac{B^3}{81}$\n$B^3 = -\\frac{10 \\times 81}{27} = -10 \\times 3 = -30$\n$B = -\\sqrt{30}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the form of the solution:\n$y(x) \\approx A - (-\\sqrt{30})(x_0-x)^{1/3} = A + \\sqrt{30}(x_0-x)^{1/3}$.\n\nThe constants $A$ and $x_0$ depend on the initial conditions and cannot be determined from this asymptotic analysis alone. However, the form of the solution near the singularity and the coefficient $\\sqrt{30}$ are determined. The question asks for an analytical expression that approximates the solution, with rounding to two decimal places. The most significant numerical part of this expression that can be determined analytically is the coefficient $\\sqrt{30}$.\n\n$\\sqrt{30} \\approx 3.10723...$\nRounding to two decimal places gives $3.11$.\n\nThe analytical expression approximating the solution in the large $x$ regime (approaching singularity) is thus of the form $y(x) \\approx A + 3.11(x_0-x)^{1/3}$. As the constants A and $x_0$ are not determined, and the question asks for an analytical expression for y(x), we present the derived form. However, the request for rounding suggests that the numerical coefficient is the key part of the answer.\n\n<<<\n$y(x) \\approx A + 3.11(x_0 - x)^{1/3}$\n>>>"
