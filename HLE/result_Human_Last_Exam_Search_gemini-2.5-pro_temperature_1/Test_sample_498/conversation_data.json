    "This is a sequence puzzle that appears to be based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nThe letters in the sequence, Z, X, C, V, B, and N, are all found on the bottom row of the keyboard. The standard order of this row is Z, X, C, V, B, N, M. The sequence provided seems to be a slight variation of this, with an extra \"X\" and a \"Y\" included, likely to cause confusion.\n\nIf we consider the primary pattern to be the letters of the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard in order, the letter that would follow \"N\" is \"M\".\n\n<<<M>>>"
