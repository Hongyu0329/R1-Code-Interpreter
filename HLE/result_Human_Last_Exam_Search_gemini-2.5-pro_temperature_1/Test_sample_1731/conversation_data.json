    "Using large deviation theorems as a foundation, the equilibrium state of a physical system is understood as the most probable macroscopic state, which corresponds to the one with the maximum entropy. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a rigorous mathematical framework for this principle, showing that any deviation from this equilibrium state is exponentially unlikely for a large number of particles.\n\nFor the Bose case of light quanta (photons), we consider a gas of indistinguishable bosons where the total number of particles is not conserved. This latter property implies that the chemical potential of the system is zero. The equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy are found by maximizing the statistical entropy subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy.\n\n### Framework of Large Deviation Theory\n\n1.  **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem states that the probability of the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables deviating from the true underlying distribution is governed by a rate function given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). In statistical mechanics, this provides a rigorous basis for Boltzmann's entropy formula, S = k ln W. Maximizing the entropy is equivalent to finding the most probable macroscopic configuration, as all other configurations are exponentially suppressed in probability.\n\n2.  **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**: This is a related, though less general, theorem that quantifies the probability of the empirical *mean* of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables deviating from the expected value. It can be seen as a consequence of the Sanov theorem.\n\n### Derivation of Equilibrium Values\n\nTo find the equilibrium state for a gas of photons, we maximize the Boltzmann entropy for indistinguishable particles (bosons), subject to the physical constraints of the system.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute *n<sub>i</sub>* indistinguishable photons into *g<sub>i</sub>* states at a specific energy level *ε<sub>i</sub>* is given by:\nW<sub>i</sub> = (n<sub>i</sub> + g<sub>i</sub> - 1)! / (n<sub>i</sub>! (g<sub>i</sub> - 1)!)\n\nThe total entropy of the system is S = k ln(Π<sub>i</sub> W<sub>i</sub>), where k is the Boltzmann constant. Using Stirling's approximation for large numbers, the entropy can be written as:\nS ≈ k ∑<sub>i</sub> [ (n<sub>i</sub> + g<sub>i</sub>)ln(n<sub>i</sub> + g<sub>i</sub>) - n<sub>i</sub>ln(n<sub>i</sub>) - g<sub>i</sub>ln(g<sub>i</sub>) ]\n\nThis entropy is maximized under the constraint of a fixed mean energy, ⟨E⟩ = ∑<sub>i</sub> n<sub>i</sub>ε<sub>i</sub>. Since the number of photons is not conserved, there is no constraint on the total number of particles, which corresponds to setting the chemical potential to zero.\n\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize S yields the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number ⟨n<sub>i</sub>⟩ of an energy level ε<sub>i</sub>:\n⟨n<sub>i</sub>⟩/g<sub>i</sub> = 1 / (exp(ε<sub>i</sub> / kT) - 1)\nwhere T is the absolute temperature, and the Lagrange multiplier has been identified as β = 1/kT.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe mean energy ⟨E⟩ is obtained by summing over all possible energy levels, weighted by the Bose-Einstein distribution. For a continuous spectrum of energies in a three-dimensional volume V, this sum becomes an integral over the density of states g(ε) = (8πV / (hc)³)ε², where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n⟨E⟩ = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>∞</sup> ε * g(ε) * (1 / (e<sup>ε/kT</sup> - 1)) dε = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>∞</sup> (8πV / (h³c³)) * (ε³ / (e<sup>ε/kT</sup> - 1)) dε\n\nEvaluating this integral yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation:\n**⟨E⟩ = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴**\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is found by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers back into the entropy formula and integrating over the density of states. Alternatively, it can be derived from the thermodynamic relation between energy and entropy for a photon gas.\n\nThe resulting expression for the equilibrium entropy is:\n**S = (4/3) * (⟨E⟩ / T) = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³**\n\nThese expressions for ⟨E⟩ and S represent the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas, derived from the foundational principle of maximum entropy which is rigorously established by large deviation theorems.\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (⟨E⟩):**\n⟨E⟩ = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴\n\n**Entropy (S):**\nS = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³\n>>>"
