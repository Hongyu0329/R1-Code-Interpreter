    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe principle of duality in control theory states that the properties of controllability of a system `(A, B)` are dual to the properties of observability of a system `(A^T, B^T)`. Similarly, a system `(A, C)` is observable if and only if its dual system, defined by `(A^T, C^T)`, is controllable.\n\nThe transformation to observer canonical form for a system `(A, C)` can be achieved by first considering its dual system `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)`. We then find the transformation matrix that converts this dual system into controllable canonical form. The matrices of the observer canonical form of the original system are the transposes of the matrices of the controllable canonical form of the dual system.\n\nLet the original system be:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nThe observer canonical form will be:\n`z(k+1) = A_o * z(k)`\n`y(k) = C_o * z(k)`\n\nThe dual system is given by:\n`x_d(k+1) = A^T * x_d(k) + C^T * u_d(k)`\n\nLet the controllable canonical form of this dual system be `(A_c, B_c)`. Then, the matrices for the observer canonical form of the original system are:\n`A_o = A_c^T`\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n\nThe question asks for the new matrix C, which is `C_o`. Therefore, we need to determine the input matrix `B_c` of the controllable canonical form of the dual system.\n\n**2. Define the System and its Dual**\n\n*   **Original System Matrices:**\n    `A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n    `C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\n*   **Dual System Matrices:**\n    `A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n    `B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n**3. Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System**\n\nThe structure of the controllable canonical form `(A_c, B_c)` is determined by the controllability indices (μ₁, μ₂) of the dual system `(A_d, B_d)`. These indices are calculated by checking the rank of the controllability matrix as we add columns.\n\nThe controllability matrix is `M_c = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d^2*B_d]`. Let `b₁` and `b₂` be the columns of `B_d`.\n*   `b₁ = [0; 1; 0]`\n*   `b₂ = [1; 1; 0]`\n\nFirst, we check the linear independence of these columns. They are linearly independent, so the rank of `B_d` is 2.\n\nNext, we compute `A_d*b₁` and `A_d*b₂`:\n*   `A_d*b₁ = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0; 1; 0] = [2; 1; 1]`\n*   `A_d*b₂ = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1; 1; 0] = [3; 2; 1]`\n\nNow, we form a set of linearly independent vectors from `{b₁, b₂, A_d*b₁, A_d*b₂}`.\n1.  `b₁` (independent)\n2.  `b₂` (independent from `b₁`)\n3.  `A_d*b₁` (Is it a linear combination of `b₁` and `b₂`? No, because any combination of `b₁` and `b₂` will have a zero in the third component, while `A_d*b₁` has a 1).\n\nWe have found three linearly independent vectors: `{b₁, b₂, A_d*b₁}`. The state-space dimension is n=3, so the system is controllable. The set of vectors tells us about the controllability indices. We have two vectors associated with the first input (`b₁`, `A_d*b₁`) and one vector associated with the second input (`b₂`). Therefore, the controllability indices are `μ₁ = 2` and `μ₂ = 1`.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Controllable Canonical Input Matrix `B_c`**\n\nFor a multi-input system with controllability indices `μ₁=2` and `μ₂=1`, the controllable canonical form for the input matrix `B_c` has a specific structure. Its columns are standard basis vectors `e_k`. The positions of these basis vectors are determined by the partial sums of the indices.\n*   The first non-zero row for an input appears at index `v₁ = μ₁ = 2`.\n*   The second non-zero row for an input appears at index `v₂ = μ₁ + μ₂ = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n\nThis means the columns of `B_c` will be `e₂` and `e₃`.\n`B_c = [e₂, e₃] = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n**5. Find the New Output Matrix `C_o`**\n\nAs established by the duality principle, the new output matrix `C_o` for the observer canonical form is the transpose of the `B_c` matrix.\n`C_o = B_c^T = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
