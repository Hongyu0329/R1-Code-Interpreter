    "Cellular automaton Rule 110 is a one-dimensional system where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The rule that dictates the next state of the central cell, based on the eight possible combinations of the three-cell neighborhood, can be represented by the binary sequence 01101110, which is equivalent to the decimal number 110.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by cells in state 0, the pattern evolves over time. After applying Rule 110 for 20 successive iterations, the following binary pattern emerges:\n\n**111110111111010001101**\n\nThis resulting pattern is a product of the complex and seemingly chaotic, yet deterministic, nature of Rule 110. The evolution from a simple initial state, like a single '1', can lead to intricate structures. In fact, Rule 110 is known to be capable of universal computation, meaning it can simulate any calculation or computer program.\n\n<<<111110111111010001101>>>"
