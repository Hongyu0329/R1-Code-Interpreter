    "To determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a 15 by 15 by 15 cube, a systematic packing approach is employed.\n\nFirst, the volumes of the cube and a single block are calculated as a theoretical upper limit.\n*   **Volume of the cube:** 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   **Volume of one block:** 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units.\n*   **Theoretical maximum:** 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks.\n\nHowever, this theoretical maximum does not account for the geometric constraints of fitting the blocks within the cube. A common method to solve this is to pack the blocks in layers aligned with the cube's axes.\n\nThe packing strategy is as follows:\n1.  **First Layer:** The 9-unit length of the blocks is placed along one of the 15-unit edges of the cube (e.g., the x-axis). This allows for a layer of blocks with dimensions 9 x 15 x 15. The number of blocks in this layer is (9/9) x (15/1) x (15/1) = 225 blocks. This leaves a remaining space of (15-9) x 15 x 15, which is 6 x 15 x 15.\n\n2.  **Second Layer:** In the remaining 6 x 15 x 15 space, the blocks cannot be oriented along the same axis as before since the dimension is only 6 units. The 9-unit length is now placed along one of the remaining 15-unit edges (e.g., the y-axis). This fills a region of 6 x 9 x 15. The number of blocks that can be placed here is (6/1) x (9/9) x (15/1) = 90 blocks. The remaining space is now 6 x (15-9) x 15, which is 6 x 6 x 15.\n\n3.  **Third Layer:** In the final 6 x 6 x 15 space, the blocks must be oriented along the last remaining axis (the z-axis) to fit the 9-unit length. This fills a region of 6 x 6 x 9. The number of blocks is (6/1) x (6/1) x (9/9) = 36 blocks.\n\nAfter these three layers are placed, the remaining empty space is a cube with dimensions 6 x 6 x 6. Since the longest edge of this remaining space is 6 units, no more 9x1x1 blocks can be fitted inside.\n\nBy summing the number of blocks from each step, the total is calculated:\n225 (from the first layer) + 90 (from the second layer) + 36 (from the third layer) = 351 blocks.\n\nThis \"guillotine-cut\" strategy, where the cube is sectioned and packed, is a standard approach for such packing problems and is considered optimal in this case. Another way to visualize this is by partitioning the 15x15x15 cube into eight smaller cuboids of dimensions defined by the lengths 9 and 6 (since 15 = 9 + 6), which yields the same result.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that can fit inside a cube of edge length 15 is 351.\n\n<<<351>>>"
