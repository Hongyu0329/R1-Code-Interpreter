For quintuply, sextuply, and all higher excited Slater determinants, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are identically zero. This is because the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body interactions, and in the CCSD approximation, the cluster operator is truncated at the two-body level ($T = T_1 + T_2$). Consequently, the expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}$, contains effective operators that can create a maximum of four particle-hole pairs from the reference determinant.
