# Define the number of terminal pairs from the problem description
k = 1000000

# The Multicut problem asks for a minimum capacity set of edges to remove
# to disconnect all k terminal pairs. This problem is NP-hard.

# The best-known polynomial-time approximation algorithm achieves a factor of O(log k).
# In theoretical computer science, especially for this algorithm's analysis,
# 'log' typically refers to the natural logarithm (ln). The approximation in the
# choices confirms this, as log(10^6) is approximately 13.8.

# Let's calculate the values mentioned in the options to verify them.

# Option C involves an approximation factor of log(k).
log_k_val = math.log(k)

# Option B involves an approximation factor of sqrt(log(k)).
sqrt_log_k_val = math.sqrt(log_k_val)
