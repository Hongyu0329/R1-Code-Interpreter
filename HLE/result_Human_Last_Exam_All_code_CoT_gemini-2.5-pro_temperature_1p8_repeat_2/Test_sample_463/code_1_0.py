def find_photosynthetic_taxa():
    """
    Identifies and prints the indices of taxa that undergo photochemical synthesis.

    This function is based on the biological knowledge that photochemical synthesis includes:
    - Oxygenic photosynthesis (e.g., plants, algae, cyanobacteria)
    - Anoxygenic photosynthesis (e.g., certain bacteria)
    - Photophosphorylation (e.g., haloarchaea)
    - Other light-driven synthesis (e.g., Vitamin D synthesis in humans)

    The list of species is as follows:
    1) Acanthella cavernosa - Sponge, no.
    2) Gloeochaete wittrockiana - Alga, yes.
    3) Homo sapiens - Human (Vitamin D synthesis), yes.
    4) Riftia pachyptila - Tube worm, no.
    5) Halapricum salinum - Archaea (photophosphorylation), yes.
    6) Aphanothece castagnei - Cyanobacteria, yes.
    7) Baileya pleniradiata - Plant, yes.
    8) Acanthella pulchra - Sponge, no.
    9) Ectothiorhodosinus mongolicus - Purple sulfur bacteria, yes.
    10) Chlorobaculum tepidum - Green sulfur bacteria, yes.
    11) Stygichthys typhlops - Cavefish, no.
    12) Gemmatimonas phototrophica - Bacterium, yes.
    13) Myonera garretti - Bivalve, no.
