    "To solve this problem, I will first clarify the definitions and then outline a plan to find the number of finite groups with the specified property.\n\n### Definitions\n1.  **Finite Group `G`**: A set with a finite number of elements and a binary operation that satisfies the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility).\n2.  **Product-Free Set `S`**: A subset `S` of `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y \\in S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. In other words, the set of all products `SS = \\{xy | x \\in S, y \\in S\\}` has an empty intersection with `S` (`SS \\cap S = \\emptyset`).\n3.  **Maximal by Inclusion**: A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means if you add any element `g \\in G \\setminus S` to `S`, the new set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n4.  **The Question**: We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic finite groups that contain at least one maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\n### Plan\nThe problem is a classic one in group theory. A theorem by Diananda and Yap (1975) completely classifies the finite groups that have this property. While I could simply state the theorem, the spirit of the request is to use coding skills. Therefore, I will:\n1.  Write a Python function that takes a finite group (defined by its multiplication table) and checks if it contains a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n2.  The function will iterate through all possible 2-element subsets of the group.\n3.  For each subset, it will first check if it's product-free.\n4.  If it is, it will then check for maximality by testing if adding any other element to the set makes it *not* product-free.\n5.  I will run this function on a list of small, common finite groups, including those identified by the theorem.\n6.  The code will count and report how many of these groups satisfy the condition, which will give the final answer.\n\nThis approach will demonstrate how to computationally verify the property for any given group and will lead us to the solution.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_product_free(group, subset):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a subset of a group is product-free.\"\"\"\n    elements = list(subset)\n    for x in elements:\n        for y in elements:\n            # group[x][y] gives the product of element x and element y\n            if group['op'][x][y] in subset:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(group):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a group has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    The group is represented by a dictionary with its elements and operation table.\n    \"\"\"\n    element_indices = list(range(len(group['elements'])))\n\n    # 1.
