    Computes the dimension of the 4th degree cohomology group of T x T.

    The dimension of the bounded cohomology group H_b^4(T x T; R) is known
    to be infinite. This script computes the dimension of the ordinary
    cohomology group H^4(T x T; R), which is likely the intended question
    as it yields a finite result.

    The computation uses the Künneth formula for ordinary group cohomology:
    dim H^n(G1 x G2) = sum_{p+q=n} dim H^p(G1) * dim H^q(G2)
