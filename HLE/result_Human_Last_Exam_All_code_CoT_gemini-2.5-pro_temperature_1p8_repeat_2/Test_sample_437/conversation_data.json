    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to evaluate the integral, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Set up the Problem**: The task is to evaluate the quantum mechanical integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ for a 1s Slater-type orbital (STO). The problem statement \"a 1s Slater orbital\" implies we are dealing with a diagonal element where $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi$. Therefore, we will evaluate the expectation value $\\langle \\phi | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi \\rangle$. The 1s STO is given by the function $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = N e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $N$ is a normalization constant, $\\zeta$ is the orbital exponent, and $r$ is the distance from the origin.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Calculation**: The evaluation will be broken down into two main parts, both handled within the Python script using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics:\n    a.  **Normalization**: First, we must find the normalization constant $N$. This is done by enforcing the condition that the total probability of finding the electron in space is 1, which translates to the integral $\\langle \\phi | \\phi \\rangle = \\int |\\phi|^2 d\\mathbf{r} = 1$.\n    b.  **Integral Evaluation**: With the normalized wavefunction, we will then compute the desired integral, $\\langle \\phi | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi \\rangle = \\int \\phi^* \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\phi \\,d\\mathbf{r}$. Since the STO is a real function, $\\phi^* = \\phi$.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation**: The Python code will define the necessary symbolic variables and perform the integrations. It will be structured to print out each step of the derivation clearly, showing the intermediate results for the integrals and constants. This ensures the logic is easy to follow.\n\n4.  **Final Output**: The script will conclude by printing the simplified final result of the integral. As requested, the numerical components of the final equation will be displayed before showing the fully simplified answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef evaluate_1s_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically evaluates the integral <phi|1/r|phi> for a 1s Slater orbital\n    and prints the step-by-step derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the necessary mathematical symbols.\n    # zeta is the orbital exponent, and r is the radial distance.\n    # Both are positive real numbers.\n    zeta = sp.Symbol('zeta', positive=True)\n    r = sp.Symbol('r', positive=True)\n    N = sp.Symbol('N', positive=True)  # The normalization constant\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step evaluation of <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s>\\n\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The 1s Slater-type orbital (STO) is given by: phi_1s = N * exp(-zeta*r)\")\n    print(\"where N is the normalization constant and zeta is the orbital exponent.\\n\")\n\n    # Part 1: Determine the normalization constant N\n    # The normalization condition is that the integral of |phi_1s|^2 over all space is 1.\n    # For a spherically symmetric function, the volume element dV in spherical coordinates\n    # integrates over the angular parts to 4*pi, so dV = 4*pi*r^2 dr.\n    # Equation: Integral_from_0_to_inf [ (N * exp(-zeta*r))^2 * 4*pi*r^2 ] dr = 1\n    print(\"1.
