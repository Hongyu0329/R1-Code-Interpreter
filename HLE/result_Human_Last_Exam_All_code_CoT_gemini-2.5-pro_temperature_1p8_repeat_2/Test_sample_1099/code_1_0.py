    # Step 4: Due to the linearity of the CHSH value for such mixtures, we can set up the equation:
    # B_Q = k * B_PR + (1 - k) * B_L
    # We solve for 'k', which represents the minimal fraction of the PR-Box resource required.

    # average number of bits of communication needed, as 1 PR-Box requires 1 bit to simulate.
