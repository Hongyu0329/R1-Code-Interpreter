    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`. As an electron, its spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Couple Angular Momenta:** The total angular momentum is the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta, $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$. The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, can take values from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine Eigenvalues:** A state can be a simultaneous eigenstate of both $J^2$ and $J_z$, denoted by $|j, m_j\\rangle$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula `j(j+1)ħ²`.\n    *   For each `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` ranges from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. The corresponding eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are `m_j ħ`.\n4.  **Generate Code:** The Python script will systematically calculate all possible values for `j` and `m_j` and then print the corresponding pairs of eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$. The output will explicitly show the formula and numbers used in the calculation for clarity.\n\n```python\ndef solve_p_electron_eigenvalues():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and Jz\n    for a single p-electron with spin-orbit coupling.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the primary quantum numbers for a p-electron.\n    l = 1.0  # Orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital\n    s = 0.5  # Spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\")\n    print(f\"The quantum numbers are l = {l} (orbital) and s = {s} (spin).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    # The rule is j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    \n    j_values = []\n    j_current = j_min\n    while j_current <= j_max:\n        j_values.append(j_current)\n        j_current += 1.0\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {j_values}\\n\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The common eigenvalues for the quantum states |j, mj> are as follows:\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: For each j, calculate J^2 and J_z eigenvalues.\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2, which is j(j+1)ħ^2\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # Determine the possible values for the magnetic quantum number, mj.\n        # mj ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.\n        mj_values = []\n        mj_current = -j\n        while mj_current <= j:\n            mj_values.append(mj_current)\n            mj_current += 1.0\n\n        print(f\"\\nFor states with j = {j}:\")\n        print(f\" The eigenvalue of J^2 is {j} * ({j} + 1.0) * ħ^2 = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ^2\")\n        print(f\" The possible J_z eigenvalues (mj * ħ) are:\")\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The J_z eigenvalue is mj*ħ\n            print(f\"  - For mj = {mj: >4.1f}, the eigenvalue pair is (J^2 = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ^2, J_z = {mj: >4.1f}ħ)\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the results.\nsolve_p_electron_eigenvalues()\n```"
