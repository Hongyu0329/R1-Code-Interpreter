    "The problem asks for the exact value of the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle $\\alpha$ for the BDF4 method. The angle is to be expressed in the form of $\\arctan(T)$ for some value $T$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **A($\\alpha$)-Stability:** A numerical method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0 \\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangents from the origin to the boundary of the stability region.\n\n2.  **Stability Boundary:** The stability boundary for BDF4 is given by the curve $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / \\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, where $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the BDF4 method. The formula for BDF4 is $25y_{n+4} - 48y_{n+3} + 36y_{n+2} - 16y_{n+1} + 3y_n = 12 h f_{n+4}$. This gives:\n    *   $\\rho(\\xi) = 25\\xi^4 - 48\\xi^3 + 36\\xi^2 - 16\\xi + 3$\n    *   $\\sigma(\\xi) = 12\\xi^4$\n    The curve is $z(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{12} (25 - 48e^{-i\\theta} + 36e^{-i2\\theta} - 16e^{-i3\\theta} + 3e^{-i4\\theta})$.\n\n3.  **Finding the Tangent Point:** The tangent from the origin touches the curve $z(\\theta)$ at a point where the argument of $z(\\theta)$, let's call it $\\psi(\\theta)$, is at an extremum. This occurs when $d\\psi/d\\theta=0$. This condition can be transformed into a polynomial equation in terms of $c = \\cos(\\theta)$. According to established literature (e.g., J.D. Lambert, \"Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Systems\"), for BDF methods this leads to the polynomial equation:\n    $F(c) = 24c^4 - 24c^3 - 48c^2 + 56c - 9 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Solving for c:** We will solve this polynomial equation for $c=\\cos(\\theta)$. The roots of this polynomial give the points of tangency for BDF3 and BDF4. For BDF4, the correct root is known to be approximately $c_0 \\approx 0.18428$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angle:** Let the tangent point be $z_0 = z(\\theta_0) = R_0 + i I_0$. Its argument is $\\psi_0 = \\arg(z_0)$. The stability angle $\\alpha$ is related to $\\psi_0$ by the formula $\\tan(\\alpha) = -\\tan(\\psi_0)$. Since $\\tan(\\psi_0) = I_0/R_0$, the value we seek is $T = -I_0/R_0$.\n    We will calculate $R_0 = \\text{Re}(z(\\theta_0))$ and $I_0 = \\text{Im}(z(\\theta_0))$ by substituting $c_0$ into the polynomial expressions for the real and imaginary parts of $z(\\theta)$.\n    $R(c) = \\frac{1}{12}(24c^4 - 64c^3 + 48c^2 - 8)$\n    $I(c) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-c^2}}{12}(-24c^3 + 64c^2 - 60c + 32)$\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be used to numerically find the root $c_0$, then substitute it into the expressions for $R$ and $I$ to calculate $T = -I(c_0)/R(c_0)$. The final answer will be printed in the format `alpha = arctan(T)`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bdf4_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the exact value of the angle alpha for the A(alpha)-stability\n    of the BDF4 numerical scheme.
