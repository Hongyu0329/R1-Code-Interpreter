    # Define the problem:
    # We are looking for a spectral expansion technique for the 'poloidal'
    # dependence in 'toroidal' systems.

    # Step 1: Understand the geometry.
    # A toroidal system is shaped like a doughnut. The 'poloidal' direction
    # is the short way around the circular cross-section of the doughnut.

    # Step 2: Identify the key property of poloidal dependence.
    # A function that varies along the poloidal direction must be periodic.
    # After a full 2-pi rotation in the poloidal angle, the function's
    # value must return to where it started.
    explanation_periodicity = "The key property of the poloidal coordinate in a torus is its periodicity."

    # Step 3: Match the property to the correct mathematical tool.
    # We need a series expansion specifically designed for periodic functions.
    # - A Fourier series expands a function into a sum of sines and cosines,
    #   which are the fundamental basis functions for periodic phenomena.
    # - Other options like Legendre or Chebyshev polynomials are suited for
    #   finite, non-periodic intervals.
    # - Spherical harmonics are suited for spherical, not toroidal, geometry.
    explanation_match = "A Fourier series is the standard mathematical tool for representing periodic functions."

    # Step 4: Conclude and state the answer.
