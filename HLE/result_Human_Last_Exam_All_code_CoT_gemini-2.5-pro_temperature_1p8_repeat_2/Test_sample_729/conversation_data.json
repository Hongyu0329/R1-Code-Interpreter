    "Answering this question requires applying group theory concepts to the specific structure of the generalized quaternion group $Q_{128}$. Here is the step-by-step derivation presented in a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Group**: Start by defining the generalized quaternion group of size 128, $Q_{128}$, using its presentation.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup**: Clarify the definition of a power subgroup. A subgroup $H$ is a power subgroup of $G$ if $H$ is generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$ for some integer $k$. We denote this as $H = \\mho_k(G) = \\langle \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$.\n3.  **Simplify the Problem**: It is a known result in group theory that the set of power subgroups $\\mho_k(G)$ is determined by the subgroups $\\mho_d(G)$ where $d$ is a divisor of the exponent of the group $G$. The exponent of $Q_{128}$ is 64. So we only need to analyze the subgroups generated by powers corresponding to the divisors of 64.\n4.  **Calculate for each Divisor**: The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. We will determine the resulting subgroup for each of these cases.\n5.  **Case 1: Odd Powers (k=1)**: We will show that for any odd integer $k$, $\\mho_k(Q_{128})$ results in the group $Q_{128}$ itself.\n6.  **Case 2: Even Powers (k = 2, 4, ...)**: We will show that for an even divisor $k$ of 64, the power subgroup $\\mho_k(Q_{128})$ is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$. Since these subgroups are distinct for each even divisor, this gives us 6 more subgroups.\n7.  **Count and Conclude**: Sum the number of unique subgroups found in both cases to get the total number of power subgroups.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the group and the problem\ngroup_order = 128\nn = int(math.log2(group_order))\nx_order = 2**(n - 1)\ny_square_x_power = 2**(n - 2)\n\nprint(f\"The problem is to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size {group_order}, denoted Q_{group_order}.\")\nprint(f\"The presentation for this group is: Q_{group_order} = <x, y | x^{x_order} = 1, y^2 = x^{y_square_x_power}, y^-1*x*y = x^-1>.\")\nprint(f\"For Q_128, this is: Q_128 = <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, y^-1*x*y = x^-1>.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Define power subgroups and simplify the problem\nprint(\"A power subgroup is generated by the k-th powers of all elements of the group, for some integer k.\")\nprint(\"We only need to consider k values that are divisors of the group's exponent.\")\n\ny_order = 4  # Since y^2 = x^32, y^4 = (x^32)^2 = x^64 = 1.\nexponent = x_order # lcm(64, 4) = 64\nprint(f\"The exponent of Q_{group_order} is {exponent}.\")\n\ndivisors_of_exponent = [d for d in range(1, exponent + 1) if exponent % d == 0]\nprint(f\"The divisors of {exponent} are: {divisors_of_exponent}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4, 5, 6: Calculate for each type of divisor\n\n# Case 1: k is odd.
