    "The problem is to find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. The BCH formula expresses `Z = log(e^X e^Y)` as a series of Lie polynomials in `X` and `Y`. The number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of a given order `n` with `k` generators (in this case, `X` and `Y`, so `k=2`) is given by Witt's formula.\n\nWitt's formula is:\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} [mu(d) * k^(n/d)]`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order of the coefficients (degree of the polynomial), which is 10.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `mu(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  Set `n = 10` and `k = 2`.\n2.  Find all divisors `d` of `n=10`. The divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n3.  Calculate the value of the Möbius function `mu(d)` for each divisor:\n    *   `mu(1) = 1`\n    *   `mu(2) = -1` (2 is a single prime)\n    *   `mu(5) = -1` (5 is a single prime)\n    *   `mu(10) = mu(2*5) = 1` (10 is a product of two distinct primes)\n4.  Substitute these values into Witt's formula.\n5.  Calculate the sum of the terms.\n6.  Divide the sum by `n` to get the final result.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan and print out each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bch_order_10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the\n    Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # The order\n    k = 2   # The number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    # For n=10, the divisors 'd' are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n    divisors = [1, 2, 5, 10]\n\n    # Pre-calculated values of the Mobius function for the divisors of 10.\n    mu_values = {1: 1, 2: -1, 5: -1, 10: 1}\n\n    equation_terms_str = []\n    value_terms = []\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mu_values[d]\n        power = n // d\n        term_value = mu_d * (k ** power)\n\n        total_sum += term_value\n        value_terms.append(str(term_value))\n        \n        # Build the string for each part of the equation\n        if mu_d == 1:\n            # hide the '1*' for cleaner output\n            term_str = f\"{k}^{power}\"\n        else:\n            # show '(-1)*...'\n            term_str = f\"({mu_d}) * {k}^{power}\"\n        equation_terms_str.append(term_str)\n        \n    final_result = total_sum // n\n\n    # Join terms for printing the equation.
