    "My plan is to first identify the numerical imprints on Teva brand 10mg and 20mg fluoxetine capsules by referencing publicly available drug identification information. Then, I will write a Python script that stores these numbers in variables and prints them clearly. The script will display the full number for each capsule and also break it down into its individual digits, as requested, to highlight the difference.\n\n```python\n# The imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules vary by dosage.\n# This script will display the different numbers found on the 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n\n# The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule.\nimprint_10mg = \"3105\"\n# The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule.\nimprint_20mg = \"3106\"\n\n# Print the information for the 10mg capsule\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The individual digits are: {' '.join(list(imprint_10mg))}\")\n\nprint(\"\") # Add a blank line for readability\n\n# Print the information for the 20mg capsule\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The individual digits are: {' '.join(list(imprint_20mg))}\")\n\n```\n<<<3105 and 3106>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
