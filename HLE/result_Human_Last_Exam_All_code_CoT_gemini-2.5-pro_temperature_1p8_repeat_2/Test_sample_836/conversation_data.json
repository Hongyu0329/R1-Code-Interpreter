    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your question.\n\nFirst, I will explain the physical meaning of the \"generalized pair correlation function\" in the field of nuclear criticality. This function, typically denoted as $G(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, is central to understanding the stochastic, or random, nature of neutron populations in a nuclear system.\n\nSecond, I will describe the mathematical operation requested: a \"space-time, double Fourier transform.\" This involves applying a Fourier transform with respect to both the spatial separation variable ($\\mathbf{r}$) and the time-lag variable ($t$).\n\nThird, I will provide the common name for the resulting transformed function. This name is standard in both nuclear engineering and the broader field of condensed matter physics, from which the concept was originally borrowed.\n\nFinally, I will provide a Python script that programmatically defines this transformation. Since the problem is theoretical, the code will not compute a number. Instead, it will use the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to construct and print the formal equation defining the transform. This provides a precise and clear representation of the relationship between the correlation function and its Fourier-transformed counterpart, including all the relevant variables and mathematical symbols.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Function, Integral, Symbol, exp, I, oo, Eq, pprint\nfrom sympy.vector import CoordSys3D, dot\n\ndef display_fourier_transform_definition():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically defines and prints the space-time double Fourier\n    transform of the generalized pair correlation function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction and Explanation ---\n    print(\"In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time double Fourier transform\")\n    print(\"of the generalized pair correlation function G(r, t) is called the\")\n    print(\"Dynamic Structure Factor, commonly denoted as S(k, ω).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"1.
