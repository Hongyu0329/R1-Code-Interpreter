    "My plan is to identify the theologian based on the specific criteria mentioned: developing specialized terminology for changes in natural laws applicable to both the virgin birth (as a divine miracle) and potential alterations at the Fall (a cosmic, negative event). This points to a modern philosopher of religion who has engaged deeply with metaphysics, epistemology, and the problem of evil. I will then provide the name of this theologian.\n\nThe Christian theologian who fits this description is the influential contemporary American philosopher Alvin Plantinga.\n\nIn his work, particularly in \"Warranted Christian Belief,\" Plantinga develops a sophisticated model for understanding miracles and divine action.\n\n1.  **For miracles like the virgin birth:** He argues against the Humean idea that miracles are \"violations\" of inviolable laws. Instead, he suggests that the laws of nature describe how the physical world operates *on its own*, without special divine intervention. A miracle, then, is an instance of God's direct, special causal action. He describes this as a **\"local change\"** in how nature functions, where God brings about an event that nature, left to itself, would not.\n\n2.  **For the Fall:** When addressing the problem of evil (particularly natural evil like diseases, predators, and disasters), Plantinga speculates that the current state of the natural world may not reflect its original, intended state. He proposes that there could have been a **\"massive and malevolent alteration in the functioning of the universe\"** resulting from the free actions of powerful non-human spirits (i.e., Satan and his minions). This concept of **\"Satanic causal activity\"** provides a framework for understanding how the laws of nature themselves could have been altered in a fundamental way at the Fall.\n\nThis specific, dual-application framework, with specialized concepts for both divine miraculous intervention and a possible demonic alteration of nature's laws, is characteristic of Alvin Plantinga's work.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the theologian who developed the specified terminology.\ntheologian = \"Alvin Plantinga\"\nprint(theologian)\n```\n<<<Alvin Plantinga>>>"
