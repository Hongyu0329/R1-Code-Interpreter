    "This problem requires us to decipher a complex expression in SKI combinator calculus to find an integer `n`, and then compute its logarithm base 2. The key is to translate the SKI combinators into more familiar lambda calculus functions and then perform the resulting arithmetic.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI expression:** We will break down the main expression into its constituent parts, identifying known combinators for numbers (Church numerals) and arithmetic operations.\n2.  **Analyze the components:**\n    *   `I` is the identity combinator, which also represents the Church numeral for **1** (`c_1`).\n    *   `S(I)(I)` reduces to `λf.λx. f(f x)`, which is the Church numeral for **2** (`c_2`).\n    *   The combinator `P = S(S(K(S))(K))` needs careful analysis. It acts as a function on Church numerals. We will show that `P` maps the Church numeral for 0 to 1 (`P(c_0) = c_1`) and any non-zero Church numeral `c_m` (where `m > 0`) to 2 (`P(c_m) = c_2`).\n    *   `K` is the constant combinator, `K x y = x`.\n    *   `S` is the substitution combinator, `S x y z = x z (y z)`.\n3.  **Evaluate sub-expressions:** Using the identities from step 2, we will evaluate the arguments within the main expression. The expression structure is `S(I)(B)`, where `B` is another complex expression.\n4.  **Evaluate B:** We will find that `B = c_{16}`, the Church numeral for 16. This involves interpreting nested applications of Church numerals, where `c_m(c_n)` corresponds to exponentiation `n^m`.\n5.  **Evaluate the final expression:** The entire expression `n = S(I)(c_{16})` represents a function that takes a function `f` and a value `x`, and computes `f(f^{16}(x))`, which is `f^{17}(x)`. This means the expression is the Church numeral for **17**.\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:** With `n = 17`, we will compute `log_2(17)`.\n\nThe Python code below will implement the arithmetic derived from this analysis, showing the main steps of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the value of log_2(n) for the given SKI expression.\n# The calculation is based on a step-by-step logical reduction of the SKI combinators\n# into arithmetic operations on Church numerals.\n\nprint(\"### Step-by-step Derivation ###\")\n\n# 1. Deconstruction of the expression: S(I)(B)\n# The main expression has the form S(I)(B), which is a partial application.\n# It represents the Church numeral c_{k+1}, where B is the Church numeral c_k.\n# So, our first goal is to find the integer value represented by B.\n\n# B has the form F(D), where F = S(I)(C), C = S(I)(K(P(I))), and D = P(S(I)(I))\nprint(\"\\nExpression B has the form F(D), where F is a function and D is its argument.\")\n\n# 2. Analyze the P combinator: P = S(S(K(S))(K))\n# This combinator acts on Church numerals (c_m):\n# - If m=0, P(c_0) -> c_1\n# - If m>0, P(c_m) -> c_2\nprint(\"\\nThe combinator P = S(S(K(S))(K)) maps any non-zero Church numeral to c_2 (2).\")\n\n# 3. Evaluate D = P(S(I)(I))\n# S(I)(I) is the Church numeral for 2 (c_2).\n# Since 2 > 0, P(c_2) evaluates to c_2.\nD = 2\nprint(f\"D = P(c_2), which evaluates to c_{D}.\")\n\n# 4. Evaluate F and B = F(D)\n# C = S(I)(K(P(I))). Since I = c_1, P(I) = c_2.\n# C = S(I)(K(c_2)), which represents the function: lambda y: y(c_2).\n# F = S(I)(C), which represents the function: lambda y: y(y(c_2)).\n# B = F(D) = F(c_2) = c_2(c_2(c_2)).\n# This involves interpreting c_m(c_n) as exponentiation: n^m.\nprint(\"\\nB evaluates to c_2(c_2(c_2)). We resolve this from the inside out.\")\n\n# Inside: c_2(c_2) is 2^2\nn1_base = 2\nn1_exp = 2\nn1 = n1_base ** n1_exp\nprint(f\"First step: c_2(c_2) corresponds to {n1_base}^{n1_exp} = {n1}. Result is c_{n1}.\")\n\n# Outside: c_2(c_4) is 4^2\nn2_base = n1\nn2_exp = 2\nn2 = n2_base ** n2_exp\nprint(f\"Second step: c_2(c_{n1}) corresponds to {n2_base}^{n2_exp} = {n2}. Result is c_{n2}.\")\nB_val = n2\nprint(f\"\\nSo, the combinator B represents the integer {B_val}.\")\n\n# 5. Evaluate the final expression n = S(I)(B)\n# n = S(I)(c_16). This creates the successor of c_16.\n# n = c_{16+1} = c_17\nn_val = B_val + 1\nprint(f\"\\nThe final expression n is the successor of B. n = {B_val} + 1 = {n_val}.\")\n\n# 6.
