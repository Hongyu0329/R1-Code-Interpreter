    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to handle a very large number. Standard floating-point arithmetic is not precise enough for this calculation. Here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Use Periodicity**: The tangent function has a period of π. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. We can use this property to reduce the very large number `10^100` to a smaller number between 0 and π.\n2.  **High-Precision Arithmetic**: To calculate `10^100 mod π` accurately, we need a value of π with many more digits of precision than a standard float provides. Python's `decimal` module is perfect for this, as it allows us to set an arbitrarily high level of precision for our calculations.\n3.  **Calculation Steps**:\n    *   Set the precision of the `decimal` module to a value high enough to handle `10^100`. A precision of 110 digits should be sufficient.\n    *   Calculate `r = 10^100 mod π` using the high-precision `Decimal` objects.\n    *   Calculate `tan(r)`.\n    *   Convert the final result to a string and extract the first three digits following the decimal point.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef solve_tan_gogol():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
