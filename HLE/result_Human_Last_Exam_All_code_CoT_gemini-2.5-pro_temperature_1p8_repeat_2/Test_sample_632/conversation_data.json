    "It seems you have provided instructions for a coding task but haven't specified the actual task itself. I will demonstrate a solution for a sample task that fits your instructions, and then I will answer your trivia question.\n\n**Plan for the coding task:**\n\n1.  **Define a simple equation:** I'll use the addition of two numbers, for example, 118 + 235.\n2.  **Store the numbers:** I will assign these numbers to variables, say `num1` and `num2`.\n3.  **Calculate the result:** I will compute the sum and store it in a `result` variable.\n4.  **Print the formatted equation:** I will use a print statement to display the full equation, including each number and the final result, as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script demonstrates how to solve a simple equation and print the result\n# in the requested format.\n\n# 1. Define the numbers for our equation.\nnum1 = 118\nnum2 = 235\n\n# 2. Calculate the result of the addition.\nresult = num1 + num2\n\n# 3. Print the final equation, showing each number.\nprint(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n```\nThe unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda until it was removed in 1950 was a tramway. The tram tracks ran through the square, circling the Renaissance fountain in the center.\n\n<<<A tramway>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    The \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome is famous for hosting the Pantheon church.
