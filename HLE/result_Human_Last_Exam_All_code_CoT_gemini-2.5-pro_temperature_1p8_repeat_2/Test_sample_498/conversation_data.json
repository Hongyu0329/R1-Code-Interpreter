    "This is a sequence puzzle. Here is my thinking process to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the sequence for obvious patterns:** The sequence `ZXXCVYBN` does not follow a simple alphabetical or numerical pattern.\n2.  **Look for external context:** The letters `Z, X, C, V, B, N` are all found sequentially on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard. This is a very strong clue that the keyboard layout is the key to the puzzle.\n3.  **Identify the anomalies:** The main keyboard sequence is `Z, X, C, V, B, N, M...`. The provided sequence has two extra letters that disrupt this simple pattern: a repeated `X` and a `Y`.\n4.  **Formulate a hypothesis:** The sequence is likely constructed from two separate patterns that are interleaved.\n    *   **Pattern 1 (The Base Sequence):** The letters from the QWERTY keyboard's bottom row, starting from the left: `Z, X, C, V, B, N, ...`\n    *   **Pattern 2 (The Insert Sequence):** A second sequence of letters that are inserted into the base sequence at regular intervals.\n5.  **Test the hypothesis:** Let's see how these two patterns can construct the given sequence `ZXXCVYBN`.\n    *   Start with the first two letters from the base sequence: `Z, X`.\n    *   Now, insert the first letter of the insert sequence. The sequence given has an `X` here. So, our insert sequence starts with `X`. The sequence is now `ZXX`.\n    *   Take the next two letters from the base sequence: `C, V`. The sequence is now `ZXXCV`.\n    *   Now, insert the second letter of the insert sequence. The sequence given has a `Y`. So, our insert sequence is `X, Y, ...`. The full sequence is now `ZXXCVY`.\n    *   Take the next two letters from the base sequence: `B, N`. The full sequence is now `ZXXCVYBN`.\n6.  **Confirm the pattern and find the next letter:** The pattern holds perfectly.\n    *   The rule is: Take two letters from the keyboard's bottom row, then take one letter from the insert sequence.\n    *   The insert sequence is an alphabetical progression: `X, Y, ...`\n    *   We just added `B, N` from the base sequence. The next step is to add the next letter from the insert sequence.\n    *   The insert sequence is `X, Y`, so the next letter is `Z`.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates this logic to find the next letter.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the letter sequence puzzle ZXXCVYBN_.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The puzzle is based on two interleaved sequences.\n    # 1.
