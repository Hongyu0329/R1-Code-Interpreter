The most critical counseling recommendation involves a drug interaction between her new prescription, Fluoxetine, and the over-the-counter Excedrin she took. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, and Excedrin contains aspirin, which is an NSAID. The combination of an SSRI and an NSAID significantly increases the risk of bleeding, particularly GI bleeding. The pharmacist should advise her to use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for future headaches instead of Excedrin or other NSAIDs, and to watch for signs of bleeding like unusual bruising or dark stools.
