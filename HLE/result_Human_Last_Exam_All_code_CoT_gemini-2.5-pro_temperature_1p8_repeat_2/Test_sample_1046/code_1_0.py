    print("Problem: A bacterium with a stable genome (Bacterium 2) acquires drug resistance as quickly as one using lateral transfer (Bacterium 1).")
    print("\nStep 1: The Source of Resistance")
    print("Since Bacterium 2 has a stable genome and no lateral transfer, the only source for a new resistance trait is a random, rare chromosomal mutation.")

    print("\nStep 2: The Issue of Pace")
    print("A 'rare' event does not automatically lead to a 'fast' outcome for the whole population. The initial resistance mutation might have a fitness cost, making the bacterium grow slower. If so, it would not spread quickly. We need a mechanism for rapid spread after the rare mutation occurs.")

    print("\nStep 3: Explaining Rapid Spread")
    print("The concept of 'compensatory mutations' is key. These are secondary mutations that can reverse the fitness cost of the primary resistance mutation.")
    print("If these compensatory mutations go a step further and 'increase the fitness to a great extent', the newly resistant and compensated bacterium becomes a 'super-competitor'. It will rapidly out-populate the original, non-resistant bacteria.")

    print("\nStep 4: The Force Multiplier - Cross-Resistance")
    print("If the mutation(s) also happen to confer resistance to other drugs ('cross-resistance'), this new strain becomes incredibly advantageous in an environment with multiple threats, further accelerating its dominance.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The most complete explanation is a sequence of events: a rare resistance mutation, followed by compensatory mutations that greatly increase overall fitness, and the added benefit of cross-resistance. This combination turns a rare initial event into a rapid population-wide takeover, matching the pace seen with lateral transfer.")
