    "Of course. Here is a Python script to determine the crystal classes that fit your criteria.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Crystal Class Categories:** First, I will define the 32 crystallographic point groups. Then, I will categorize them into sets based on their properties:\n    *   **Optically Active (Chiral):** Crystal classes that lack a center of inversion and mirror planes. Only these can exhibit optical activity.\n    *   **Achiral:** All crystal classes that are not chiral.\n    *   **Polar:** Crystal classes with at least one unique polar direction.\n    *   **Non-Polar:** All crystal classes that are not polar.\n\n2.  **Analyze the User's Request:** Your question asks for classes that are simultaneously **achiral**, **non-polar**, and **optically active**. This contains a fundamental contradiction, as optical activity requires a class to be **chiral**, not achiral.\n\n3.  **Execute and Explain:** The script will first find the intersection of the three sets from your query (`achiral`, `non-polar`, `optically_active`). As expected, this will result in an empty set, which I will print and explain.\n\n4.  **Provide a Clarification:** Since it's likely you may have meant to ask for **chiral** and non-polar classes, the script will also calculate and display this set of classes for your reference. These are the non-polar crystal classes that do exhibit optical activity.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes based on symmetry properties related to optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes) in Hermann-Mauguin notation\n    all_32_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '3', '-3', '32',\n        '3m', '-3m', '4', '-4', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # A crystal class must be chiral (lacking rotoinversion axes like mirror planes or inversion centers) to be optically active.\n    # There are 11 such classes.\n    optically_active_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'}\n    chiral_classes = optically_active_classes\n\n    # Achiral classes are all classes that are not chiral.\n    achiral_classes = all_32_classes - chiral_classes\n\n    # Polar classes are those with a unique axis of polarity.\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', 'm', 'mm2', '3', '3m', '4', '4mm', '6', '6mm'}\n\n    # Non-polar classes are all classes that are not polar.\n    non_polar_classes = all_32_classes - polar_classes\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Crystal Classes for Optical Activity ---\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
