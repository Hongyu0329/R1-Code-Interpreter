# Step 1: Define the dimension of the initial space P.
# The log point P with log structure N^3 corresponds to the affine 3-space, A^3.
dim_P = 3

# Step 2: The log blowup corresponds to a standard blowup operation in algebraic geometry.
# A key property of a blowup is that it is a birational map, which means it
# preserves the dimension of the ambient space.
# So, the dimension of the blowup is equal to the dimension of the original space P.
dim_blowup = dim_P

# Step 3: Print the result.
# The final result is the dimension of the log blowup. We present the relationship
# as an equation showing all the numbers.
print(f"Dimension of the log blowup = Dimension of P = {dim_blowup}")
