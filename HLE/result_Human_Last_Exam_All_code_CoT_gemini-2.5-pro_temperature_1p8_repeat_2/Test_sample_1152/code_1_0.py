# --- Step-by-step analysis ---

# 1. Analyze if Fungus A is a pathogen
print("Analysis for Fungus A:")
is_A_pathogen = fungus_A_mortality > baseline_mortality
print(f"Comparing mortality: Is the mortality rate with Fungus A ({fungus_A_mortality}%) greater than the baseline mortality ({baseline_mortality}%)?")
print(f"The equation is {fungus_A_mortality} > {baseline_mortality}, which is {is_A_pathogen}.")
print("Conclusion: Fungus A is a pathogen.\n")

# 2. Analyze if Fungus B is a pathogen
print("Analysis for Fungus B:")
is_B_pathogen = fungus_B_mortality > baseline_mortality
print(f"Comparing mortality: Is the mortality rate with Fungus B ({fungus_B_mortality}%) greater than the baseline mortality ({baseline_mortality}%)?")
print(f"The equation is {fungus_B_mortality} > {baseline_mortality}, which is {is_B_pathogen}.")
print("Conclusion: Fungus B is a pathogen.\n")

# 3. Analyze if Fungus C is a pathogen or commensal
print("Analysis for Fungus C:")
is_C_pathogen = fungus_C_mortality > baseline_mortality
print(f"Comparing mortality: Is the mortality rate with Fungus C ({fungus_C_mortality}%) greater than the baseline mortality ({baseline_mortality}%)?")
print(f"The equation is {fungus_C_mortality} > {baseline_mortality}, which is {is_C_pathogen}.")
print("Since Fungus C does not increase mortality, it is not a pathogen.")

# Check for commensalism by observing productivity (using lavender pollen as an example)
is_C_beneficial = eggs_infected_C_lavender > eggs_healthy_lavender
print(f"\nChecking productivity: Does Fungus C help bees (using lavender pollen data)?")
print(f"Comparing egg counts: Is the number of eggs with Fungus C ({eggs_infected_C_lavender}) greater than without ({eggs_healthy_lavender})?")
print(f"The equation is {eggs_infected_C_lavender} > {eggs_healthy_lavender}, which is {is_C_beneficial}.")
print("Conclusion: Fungus C does not cause harm and can increase productivity, so it is a commensal or mutualist.\n")

# 4. Final conclusion
print("Summary: Fungus A and Fungus B are pathogens, while Fungus C is a commensal.")
print("This matches answer choice I.")
