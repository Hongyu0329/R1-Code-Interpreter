    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integral to evaluate is `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1. This integrand is in the form `f'(x)/f(x)`, where `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The antiderivative of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`. So, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The value of the definite integral is the difference in the antiderivative evaluated at the upper and lower limits: `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which is `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n4.  **Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits**:\n    *   **At x = 1**:\n        *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n        *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n        *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n        *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   **At x = 0**:\n        *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n        *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n        *   `F₂(0) = e^(0) = 1`\n        *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n5.  **Check the Sign of F₃(x)**: For `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is non-negative, `e^(sin(x))` is greater than or equal to 1, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is greater than or equal to 2, and `ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is greater than or equal to `ln(2)`. Thus, `F₃(x)` is positive on the interval `[0, 1]`, and we can drop the absolute value signs.\n6.  **Calculate the Value V**: The integral's value is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`, which is `ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n7.  **Final Calculation**: We will use Python to compute the numerical value of `V`, multiply it by 10000, and round to the nearest integer.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations and prints out the components of the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral problem step-by-step.\n    The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 simplifies to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n    This function calculates this value, multiplies by 10000, and rounds to the nearest integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the chain of functions\n    def F0(x):\n        return x\n\n    def F1(x):\n        return math.sin(F0(x))\n\n    def F2(x):\n        return math.exp(F1(x))\n\n    def F3(x):\n        return math.log(1 + F2(x))\n\n    # Evaluate F₃(x) at the upper and lower bounds of the integral\n    F3_at_1 = F3(1)\n    F3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n    # The value of the integral V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    V = math.log(F3_at_1) - math.log(F3_at_0)\n\n    # The final result is the closest integer to 10000 * V\n    final_answer = round(10000 * V)\n\n    print(\"The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Breakdown ---\")\n    \n    # Print the equation parts\n    print(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ {F3_at_1}\")\n    print(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ {F3_at_0}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, V = ln({F3_at_1}) - ln({F3_at_0})\")\n    print(f\"V ≈ {V}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"The required value is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\n    print(f\"10000 * V ≈ {10000 * V}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer is: {final_answer}\")\n\n\nsolve_integral()\n<<<5487>>>\n```"
