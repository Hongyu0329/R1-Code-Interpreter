    "This problem asks for the number of distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the group**: The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$. It is a group of order $2^n$ where $n=9$.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n3.  **Simplify the Problem**: The set of power subgroups $\\{G^k\\}$ depends on the exponents $k$. We can simplify the problem by analyzing the structure of these subgroups.\n    *   Any integer $k$ can be written as $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $j \\ge 0$.\n    *   The set of $k$-th powers can be expressed as $G^k = G^{2^j \\cdot m} = \\{g^{m \\cdot 2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{(g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    *   For the semidihedral group $G = SD_{2^n}$, it can be shown that for any odd integer $m$, the set of $m$-th powers $G^m = \\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is equal to the group $G$ itself.\n    *   Therefore, $G^k = \\{(g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in G\\} = G^{2^j}$.\n    *   This means we only need to count the number of distinct subgroups of the form $G^{2^j}$ for $j \\ge 0$.\n4.  **Identify and Count the Distinct Subgroups**: We will compute the subgroups $G^{2^j}$ and check how many of them are unique. The exponent of $SD_{2^9}$ is $2^{9-1}=256$. The sequence of subgroups $G^{2^j}$ will eventually become the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$. We only need to consider $j$ from $0$ up to $8$, since $G^{2^8} = G^{256} = \\{1\\}$.\n    *   For $j=0$, we have $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$.\n    *   For $j \\ge 1$, the subgroup $G^{2^j}$ in $SD_{2^n}$ is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$, where $r$ is the generator of the maximal cyclic subgroup of order $2^{n-1}$.\n    *   The subgroups are: $G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n    *   These subgroups have distinct orders ($512, 128, 64, \\dots, 1$), so they are all distinct.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The number of distinct power subgroups is the number of distinct values for $j$, which is $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 8$. This gives a total of 9 distinct subgroups. The Python code below will formalize this counting.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n    \n    # For a semidihedral group of size 2^n, find n.\n    # size = 2^n => n = log2(size)\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    print(f\"The group is the semidihedral group SD_{group_size}, which is SD_{{2**n}}.\")\n    print(f\"Here, n = {n}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understanding Power Subgroups\")\n    print(\"A power subgroup G^k is the set of all k-th powers of elements in G, {g^k | g in G}.\")\n    print(\"We need to find the number of distinct subgroups for different integers k.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Simplifying the exponents k\")\n    print(\"Any integer k can be written as k = 2^j * m, where m is odd.\")\n    print(\"For semidihedral groups, it can be shown that for any odd m, G^m = G.\")\n    print(\"So, G^k = G^(2^j * m) = (G^m)^(2^j) = G^(2^j).\")\n    print(\"This means we only need to count the number of distinct subgroups for k of the form 2^j.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Listing the distinct power subgroups G^(2^j)\")\n    print(\"The exponent of SD_{2^n} is 2^(n-1).
