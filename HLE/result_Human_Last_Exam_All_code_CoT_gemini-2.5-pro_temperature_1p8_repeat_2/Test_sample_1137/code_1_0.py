    # Option A
    print("\n- A. Ontario Court of Appeal: This is an appellate court. It hears appeals from lower courts, but a new lawsuit cannot be initiated here. This option is incorrect.")

    # Option C
    print("- C. Superior Court of Justice: This court has jurisdiction over the matter. However, a standard proceeding might be slower than specialized alternatives.")
    
    # Option D
    print("- D. Small Claims Court: The dispute over six large commercial properties far exceeds the monetary limit of the Small Claims Court (currently $35,000 in Ontario). This option is incorrect.")

    # Option E
    print("- E. Federal Court of Canada: This court has limited jurisdiction over federal matters (e.g., copyright, maritime law, claims against the federal government). A private commercial dispute governed by provincial contract law does not fall under its jurisdiction. This option is incorrect.")
    
    # Option B
    print("\n- B. Commercial List: This is a specialized list within the Superior Court of Justice designed to handle complex commercial litigation. It is known for its expert judges and active case management, which helps to expedite proceedings and lead to faster resolutions. This aligns perfectly with RE1's need for the 'shortest amount of time'.")

    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion.")
    print("Given the complex commercial nature of the dispute and the desire for an expedited process, the Commercial List is the best available choice.")
