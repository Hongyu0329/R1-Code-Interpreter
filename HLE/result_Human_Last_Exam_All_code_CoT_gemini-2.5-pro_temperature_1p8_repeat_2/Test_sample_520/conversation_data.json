    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this historical query using a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will create a Python script to answer the question.\n2.  Inside the script, I will store the known information about Andre Vernault in a dictionary. This dictionary will hold key facts such as his name, the suspicion against him, and, most importantly, his concealed true profession.\n3.  The script will then access the value associated with his \"true profession\" from the dictionary.\n4.  Finally, the script will print this information in a clear, readable format to answer your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_true_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and retrieves historical information\n    about Andre Vernault to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Storing the historical data in a dictionary\n    andre_vernault_file = {\n        \"name\": \"Andre Vernault\",\n        \"context\": \"A Belgian refugee during World War II, suspected by UK counterintelligence.\",\n        \"reason_for_suspicion\": \"He concealed his true profession during interrogation.\",\n        \"true_profession\": \"Brothel-keeper\"\n    }\n\n    # Retrieve and print the true profession\n    profession = andre_vernault_file[\"true_profession\"]\n    print(\"Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee suspected of being a German spy, concealed his true profession from interrogators.\")\n    print(\"His true profession was: \" + profession)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer\nfind_true_profession()\n```\n<<<Brothel-keeper>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
