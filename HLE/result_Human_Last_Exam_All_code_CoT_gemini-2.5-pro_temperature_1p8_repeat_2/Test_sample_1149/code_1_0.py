# Based on the primary description of the Irritator challengeri skull (SMNS 58022)
# by Sues et al. (2002), we can determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess.

# The paper states: "The large lacrimal recess is subdivided by a vertical ridge into two deep, rounded depressions..."

# Therefore, the number of depressions is 2.
num_depressions = 2

# The following code will print the answer.
print(f"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {num_depressions} depressions.")
