    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to identify the molecular structure of a standard nanocar. Since \"nanocar\" can refer to several different molecules, we will base our calculation on the original nanocar, which was synthesized by the group of Professor James Tour at Rice University in 2005.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  **Identify the Base Molecule:** We will use the chassis of the first nanocar. This is the structural frame to which the fullerene \"wheels\" are attached.\n2.  **Find its Molecular Formula:** According to computational studies of this original nanocar, the chassis has a molecular formula of **C44H26O4**.\n3.  **Apply Perfluorination:** The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that every hydrogen atom (H) in the molecule is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\n4.  **Calculate:** The number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original chassis. The chassis has 26 hydrogen atoms, so the perfluoronanocar would have 26 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe following Python code details this logic and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the properties of the original nanocar chassis\nchassis_formula = \"C44H26O4\"\nnum_hydrogens_in_chassis = 26\n\nprint(\"This program calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical 'perfluoronanocar'.\")\nprint(\"We base our calculation on the chassis of the first nanocar, synthesized by the Tour group (2005).\")\nprint(f\"The molecular formula of this chassis is {chassis_formula}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\nprint(f\"The term 'perfluoro-' means every hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\")\nprint(f\"The nanocar chassis has {num_hydrogens_in_chassis} hydrogen atoms available for replacement.\")\n\n# The calculation is a 1-to-1 replacement\nfluorine_per_hydrogen = 1\ntotal_fluorine_atoms = fluorine_per_hydrogen * num_hydrogens_in_chassis\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final calculation is based on this one-to-one replacement:\")\nprint(f\"  {num_hydrogens_in_chassis} (hydrogen atoms in original molecule)\")\nprint(f\"x {fluorine_per_hydrogen} (fluorine atom per hydrogen atom)\")\nprint(\"---------------------------------------\")\nprint(f\"= {total_fluorine_atoms} (total fluorine atoms in perfluoronanocar)\")\n\n```\n<<<26>>>"
