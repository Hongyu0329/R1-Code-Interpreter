    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Request:** The goal is to find the best-known lower bound for the size of a \"cap set\" in dimension 8. This is a question from the field of mathematics, specifically combinatorics.\n2.  **Define Cap Set:** A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_3$ (the integers modulo 3) such that no three points lie on a line. The maximum size of a cap set in the n-dimensional space $\\mathbb{F}_3^n$ is denoted by $r_3(n)$.\n3.  **Identify the Specific Problem:** The request asks for the best-known lower bound for $r_3(8)$. Lower bounds are established by explicitly constructing a cap set of a certain size. Finding these bounds is an active area of research.\n4.  **Retrieve the Known Bound:** I will access established mathematical knowledge to find the current record for the lower bound of $r_3(8)$. Simple constructions like the product method ($r_3(a+b) \\ge r_3(a) \\cdot r_3(b)$) give a bound of $r_3(6) \\cdot r_3(2) = 112 \\cdot 4 = 448$, but this has been surpassed by more complex constructions. According to recent results (e.g., from O'Sullivan), the best-known lower bound is 496.\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that states this fact. To fulfill the requirement of showing an \"equation,\" the script will print the formal mathematical inequality representing this lower bound.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.\n\n    A cap set is a set of points in the n-dimensional vector space over the field with 3 elements (F_3^n)\n    such that no three points are collinear. The size of the largest possible cap set is denoted by r_3(n).\n\n    Lower bounds are found by constructing specific large cap sets. While there are methods to generate\n    bounds (e.g., product construction), the best-known bounds for specific dimensions are often the\n    result of dedicated, complex constructions.\n\n    For dimension 8, the best-known lower bound comes from a construction by O'Sullivan.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    dimension = 8\n    best_known_lower_bound = 496\n\n    # We present the answer as a formal mathematical inequality,\n    # satisfying the instruction to show the numbers in a final equation.\n    \n    print(f\"The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension {dimension}, denoted r_3({dimension}), is {best_known_lower_bound}.\")\n    print(\"The final inequality is:\")\n    print(f\"r_3({dimension}) >= {best_known_lower_bound}\")\n\nsolve_cap_set_bound()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
