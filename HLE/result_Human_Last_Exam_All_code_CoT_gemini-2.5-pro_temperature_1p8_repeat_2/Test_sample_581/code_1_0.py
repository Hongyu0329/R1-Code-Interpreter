def solve_cap_set_bound():
    """
    This function provides the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.

    A cap set is a set of points in the n-dimensional vector space over the field with 3 elements (F_3^n)
    such that no three points are collinear. The size of the largest possible cap set is denoted by r_3(n).

    Lower bounds are found by constructing specific large cap sets. While there are methods to generate
    bounds (e.g., product construction), the best-known bounds for specific dimensions are often the
    result of dedicated, complex constructions.

    For dimension 8, the best-known lower bound comes from a construction by O'Sullivan.
