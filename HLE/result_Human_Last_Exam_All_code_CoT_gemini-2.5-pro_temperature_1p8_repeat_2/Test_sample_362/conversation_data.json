    "The user wants to find the product of a specific Wittig reaction.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  First, I need to identify the reactants involved in the Wittig reaction. The reactants are an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and a phosphonium ylide ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane).\n2.  Next, I will determine the structures of these reactants.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde is the common name for 2,2-dimethylpropanal, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. The reacting part is the C=O group.\n    *   The ylide's name, \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\", needs careful interpretation. The \"ethylidene\" group is CH₃-CH=, and the \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl))\" substituent is on the second carbon atom of the ethylidene group. This gives the substituent structure (2-chlorophenyl)-CH₂-CH=. Therefore, the full ylide structure is (2-chlorophenyl)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃. The reacting part is the C=P double bond.\n3.  Then, I will apply the general mechanism of the Wittig reaction. The reaction forms an alkene by creating a new C=C double bond between the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde and the ylidic carbon of the phosphonium ylide. The oxygen atom from the aldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group from the ylide are eliminated, forming triphenylphosphine oxide (O=PPh₃) as a byproduct.\n4.  By combining the corresponding fragments, the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part from the aldehyde and the `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` part from the ylide, I can construct the final alkene product. The structure is (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl).\n5.  Finally, I will determine the systematic IUPAC name for this product structure. The longest carbon chain containing the C=C double bond is a five-carbon chain (a pentene). Following IUPAC numbering rules, the final name is 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene. Note that this molecule can exist as E and Z isomers, but without specified reaction conditions, we identify the constitutional isomer.\n6.  I will now generate a Python script to print this reaction equation and the final product's name, emphasizing the numbers in the name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the specified Wittig reaction and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define reactants\n    aldehyde_name = \"pivalaldehyde ((CH3)3C-CHO)\"\n    ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    \n    # Define products\n    # Product structure: (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(2-chlorophenyl)\n    # Byproduct structure: (C6H5)3P=O\n    product_name_base = \"-(2-chlorophenyl)-,-dimethylpent--ene\"\n    numbers = [\"1\", \"4,4\", \"2\"] # Numbers for IUPAC name locants\n    byproduct_name = \"triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n\n    print(\"The Wittig reaction involves the following reactants:\")\n    print(f\"1.
