    This script determines the set M required to prove the existence and
    uniqueness of a global solution to a given boundary value problem (BVP)
    using the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.

    The BVP is:
    u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, for x in (0, 1)
    u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0

    Our plan is as follows:
    1. Reformulate the BVP as a fixed-point problem u = T(u) by converting
       the differential equation into an equivalent integral equation.
    2. Define a suitable complete metric space M on which the operator T acts.
    3. Show that T maps the set M to itself (T(M) is a subset of M).
    4. Show that T is a contraction mapping on M.
    5. Conclude that by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, a unique solution
       exists in M.

    # --- Step 1 & 2: Define the Fixed-Point Problem and Space ---
    # The BVP u'' = exp(u(x)) with u(0)=u(1)=0 can be written as u = T(u), where T
    # is the integral operator:
    # (Tu)(x) = integral from 0 to 1 of G(x, s) * exp(u(s)) ds
    # Here, G(x, s) is the Green's function for u''=f with zero boundary conditions.
    # We work in the space X = {u in C[0, 1] | u(0) = u(1) = 0}, which is
    # a complete metric space under the supremum norm ||.||_inf.

    # --- Step 3 & 4: Find the set M and Verify Conditions ---
    # The Green's function G(x,s) is non-positive. Since exp(u(s)) is always
    # positive, it implies that (Tu)(x) <= 0 for any function u. This suggests the
    # solution u(x) must be non-positive.

    # Let's consider a set of non-positive functions. If u(x) <= 0, then
    # exp(u(x)) <= exp(0) = 1. We can establish a lower bound for T(u):
    # (Tu)(x) = - integral from 0 to 1 of |G(x,s)| * exp(u(s)) ds
    #         >= - integral from 0 to 1 of |G(x,s)| * 1 ds
    # The integral of |G(x,s)| wrt s is x(1-x)/2. The minimum value of -x(1-x)/2
    # on [0, 1] is -1/8 (which occurs at x=1/2).
    # So, for any u with u(x)<=0, we have -1/8 <= (Tu)(x) <= 0.
    # This suggests the invariant set M that we are looking for.

    # We can also show T is a contraction on this set. The derivative of
    # exp(u) is exp(u). On our proposed set M, u <= 0, so the derivative
    # exp(u) is bounded by exp(0) = 1. The contraction constant k is the
    # product of this bound (1) and the norm of the integral operator,
    # which is max(integral(|G(x,s)|ds)) = 1/8. So k = 1/8, which is < 1.

    # --- Step 5: Define the final set M ---
