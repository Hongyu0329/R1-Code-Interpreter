    # --- Analysis of each option ---

    # Option A
    print("Option A: A distribution of bonds without a prospectus by Bank of China (Canada) to retail investors.")
    print("  - Issuer: Bank of China (Canada) is a Schedule III bank under Canada's Bank Act.")
    print("  - Regulation: National Instrument 45-106 provides a prospectus exemption for a debt security issued by a bank listed in Schedule I, II, or III.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This distribution appears compliant. The exemption is based on the issuer being a regulated bank and applies to its debt securities, even when distributed to retail investors.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Option B
    print("Option B: A distribution of bonds by JPMorgan Chase without a prospectus to a large number of investors in Canada.")
    print("  - Issuer: JPMorgan Chase is a U.S. parent company, not a bank listed under the Canadian Bank Act.")
    print("  - Regulation: The bank debt exemption does not apply. For a wide distribution to retail investors, no other common exemption appears applicable without more information.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This distribution is likely non-compliant.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Option C
    print("Option C: A distribution of shares by a private issuer to an unrelated individual with net assets of $10,000.")
    print("  - Investor Status: The investor does not meet the financial thresholds to be an 'accredited investor' (e.g., net financial assets > $1M, or net assets > $5M, or income > $200k).")
    print("  - Regulation: Since the investor has no connection to the company, exemptions like the 'private issuer' exemption are not available. ")
    print("  - Conclusion: This distribution is non-compliant.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Option D
    print("Option D: A distribution of shares without a prospectus by Fairstone Bank of Canada to retail investors.")
    print("  - Issuer Status (Jan 2020): In January 2020, Fairstone was not a bank. It became a Schedule I bank in 2021. Therefore, the bank exemption does not apply.")
    print("  - Security Type: Even if it were a bank, the bank exemption is for DEBT securities, not shares.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This distribution is non-compliant.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # Option E
    print("Option E: A distribution of shares without a prospectus by Caisse populaire acadienne lt√©e to retail investors, including one with zero assets.")
    print("  - Issuer: A 'Caisse populaire' is a type of credit union.")
    print("  - Regulation: National Instrument 45-106 provides a broad prospectus exemption for any security issued by a credit union or caisse populaire.")
    print("  - Key Point: This exemption is based on the nature of the issuer (a regulated, community-based financial co-operative) and not on the financial status of the investor. The shares often represent membership and are a core part of the institution's function.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This distribution is compliant. The detail about the investor with zero assets is a distractor; the exemption still applies.")
    print("-" * 70)

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("Final Determination:")
    print("Both A and E appear to describe legally compliant distributions. However, option E is the strongest answer.")
    print("The reason is that the distribution of membership shares (even to members with no assets) is a fundamental and core activity for a caisse populaire, for which the exemption was specifically created.")
    print("This scenario perfectly illustrates the purpose and application of the credit union exemption, making it the most accurate and well-defined example of a compliant distribution among the choices.")
    print("\nTherefore, the most compliant distribution described is E.")
