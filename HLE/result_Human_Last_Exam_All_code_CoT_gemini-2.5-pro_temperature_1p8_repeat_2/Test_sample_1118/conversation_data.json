    "My plan is to first identify the specific self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933. Then, I will research the details of this painting to find out what object he is holding. Finally, I will determine the symbolic meaning of that object in the context of his recent escape from the Gestapo to answer the user's question. Since this is a knowledge-based question, I will provide the answer directly rather than generating code.\n\nIn his 1933 painting, \"Self-Portrait with Thistle\" (*Selbstbildnis mit Distel*), created after his release from Gestapo custody, Curt Querner holds a thistle. The prickly and resilient nature of the thistle plant serves as a powerful symbol of his defiance and steadfast resistance against the oppressive Nazi regime.\n\n<<<A thistle>>>"
