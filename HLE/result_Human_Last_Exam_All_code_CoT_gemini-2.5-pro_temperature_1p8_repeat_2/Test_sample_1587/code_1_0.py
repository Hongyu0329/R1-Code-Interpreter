    Solves the puzzle of finding the smallest k pieces to form a square in 5 ways.
    
    This is a known problem in recreational mathematics. The solution cannot be
    found by a simple brute-force computation, as the ways to cut a square are
    infinite. The answer relies on specific, known dissections.
    
    The question is about the number of "non-isomorphic" assemblies. For a set
    of pieces to tile a square in exactly 5 ways, it is a highly constrained
    problem. The prime number 5 not dividing 8 (the order of the symmetry
    group of a square) is a key feature that makes the problem difficult and
    rules out simple symmetric configurations.
    
    A known dissection by puzzle designer Serhiy Grabarchuk shows that a solution
    with k=6 pieces exists. It is widely accepted in the puzzling community
    that this is the smallest number of pieces possible, although a formal
    mathematical proof of minimality is very complex and not readily available.
    No solution with k<6 is known to exist.
