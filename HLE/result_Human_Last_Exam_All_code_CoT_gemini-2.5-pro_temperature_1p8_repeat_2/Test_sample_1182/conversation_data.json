    "To find the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we need to find a new model of the curve that behaves well when reduced modulo 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial reduction:** The given equation, when reduced modulo 2, is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, which is equivalent to $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This represents a \"double line\", which is a non-reduced curve. This is not a stable model.\n2.  **Find a better model:** We perform a change of variables of the form $x = 2^e X$ and $y = 2^k Y$. The goal is to find integers `e` and `k` such that the resulting equation for $Y$ and $X$ becomes stable when reduced modulo 2.\n3.  **Perform the transformation:** Through analysis (related to the Newton polygon of the polynomial), the optimal choice is found to be $e=3$ and $k=3$. This corresponds to the transformation $x=8X$ and $y=8Y$.\n4.  **Derive the new equation:** We substitute $x=8X$ and $y=8Y$ into the original equation and simplify it to obtain a new equation with integer coefficients, which is a minimal model.\n5.  **Reduce the new equation modulo 2:** The resulting equation from step 4 is then reduced modulo 2. This gives the special fiber of the stable model.\n6.  **Count the double points:** We analyze the reduced curve for singularities. A double point is a type of singularity. Since the reduced curve turns out to be smooth (i.e., it has no singularities), it has zero double points.\n\nThe following Python code implements Step 3 and 4 to derive the new, stable equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve\n    and determines the number of double points.\n    \n    The curve is y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\n    We work over the prime p = 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Coefficients of f(x) for powers x^1, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5\n    c_orig = [8, 1, 4, 4, 8]\n    p = 2\n    \n    # Through analysis, we find the best transformation uses e=3.\n    # The transformation is x = p^e * X, y = p^k * Y\n    e = 3\n    \n    # We choose k such that the coefficient of Y^2 becomes 1.\n    # The condition is that 2k equals the minimum valuation of the terms on the RHS.\n    # min_valuation = min(v_p(c_i) + i*e for i in range(1, 6))\n    # v_p(8) = 3, v_p(1) = 0, v_p(4) = 2, v_p(4) = 2, v_p(8) = 3\n    v = [3, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n    valuations = [v[i-1] + i*e for i in range(1, 6)]\n    min_valuation = min(valuations) # This is 6 for e=3\n    \n    # We need 2k = min_valuation\n    k = min_valuation // 2\n\n    print(f\"Starting with the curve: y^2 = {c_orig[0]}*x + {c_orig[1]}*x^2 + {c_orig[2]}*x^3 + {c_orig[3]}*x^4 + {c_orig[4]}*x^5\")\n    print(f\"To find the stable reduction, we perform a change of variables: x = {p**e}*X and y = {p**k}*Y.\")\n    print(f\"This is x = {int(p**e)}*X and y = {int(p**k)}*Y.\")\n    \n    # The transformed equation is Y^2 = sum(c'_i * X^i), where c'_i = c_i * p^(i*e - 2k)\n    new_c = []\n    for i in range(1, 6):\n        coeff = c_orig[i-1] * (p**(i*e - 2*k))\n        new_c.append(int(coeff))\n\n    print(\"\\nThe transformed equation is Y^2 = c'_1*X + c'_2*X^2 + c'_3*X^3 + c'_4*X^4 + c'_5*X^5.\")\n    print(\"The new integer coefficients are:\")\n    for i in range(5):\n        print(f\"c'_{i+1} = {new_c[i]}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe full transformed equation is:\")\n    final_equation_str = f\"Y^2 = {new_c[0]}*X + {new_c[1]}*X^2 + {new_c[2]}*X^3 + {new_c[3]}*X^4 + {new_c[4]}*X^5\"\n    print(final_equation_str)\n\n    print(\"\\nReducing this equation modulo 2, we get:\")\n    reduced_parts = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(new_c):\n        if coeff % 2 != 0:\n            power = i + 1\n            if power == 1:\n                reduced_parts.append(\"X\")\n            else:\n                reduced_parts.append(f\"X^{power}\")\n    reduced_equation = \"Y^2 = \" + \" + \".join(reduced_parts)\n    print(reduced_equation)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe curve Y^2 = X + X^2 is smooth, meaning it has no singular points.\")\n    print(\"Since double points are a type of singular point, this curve has no double points.\")\n    \nsolve_curve_reduction()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
