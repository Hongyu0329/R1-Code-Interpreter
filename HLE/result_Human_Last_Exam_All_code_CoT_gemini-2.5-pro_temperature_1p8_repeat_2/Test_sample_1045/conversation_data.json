    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is described by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitives).\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split. The inner part (2s', 2px', 2py', 2pz') is described by 4 contracted functions (from 3 primitives each). The outer part (2s'', 2px'', 2py'', 2pz'') is described by another 4 contracted functions (from 1 primitive each).\n        *   Total for one C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n        *   Hydrogen only has a valence 1s orbital, which is split.\n        *   The inner part (1s') is described by 1 contracted function (from 3 primitives).\n        *   The outer part (1s'') is described by 1 contracted function (from 1 primitive).\n        *   Total for one H atom = 1 + 1 = 2 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Sum the functions from all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9  # 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence)\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2 # 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence)\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted functions\ntotal_functions = (num_carbon * functions_per_carbon) + (num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The calculation for the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon} Carbon atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/atom) + ({num_hydrogen} Hydrogen atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/atom)\")\nprint(f\"= {num_carbon * functions_per_carbon} + {num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{num_carbon} * {functions_per_carbon} + {num_hydrogen} * {functions_per_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
