    "Of course. This is a classic result from the study of critical phenomena and quantum field theory using the Renormalization Group. Here is the step-by-step derivation followed by a Python script to present the final expression.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the Beta Function**: The core of the problem lies in the Renormalization Group (RG) flow of the `ϕ^4` coupling constant, which is described by the beta function, `β(u)`. We'll work in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, where `ϵ` is a small parameter.\n2.  **Define the Fixed Point**: A fixed point, denoted `u*`, is a specific value of the coupling where the RG flow stops, meaning the theory becomes scale-invariant. This happens when the beta function is zero: `β(u*) = 0`. We are looking for the non-trivial \"Wilson-Fisher\" fixed point.\n3.  **One-Loop Calculation**: The one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions is given by the expression:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + b * u²`\n    The first term, `-ϵu`, arises from the engineering dimension of the coupling, and the second term, `b * u²`, comes from the one-loop quantum corrections. For the `ϕ⁴` theory with a single scalar field, the coefficient is `b = 3 / (16π²)`.\n4.  **Solve for u***: We will set the beta function to zero and solve the algebraic equation for `u*`:\n    `-ϵu* + b * (u*)² = 0`\n    This gives `u*(-ϵ + b*u*) = 0`. The non-trivial solution is `u* = ϵ / b`.\n5.  **Final Expression**: By substituting the value of `b` into the equation for `u*`, we arrive at the final leading-order expression.\n\nThe following Python code will print out this result, showing each numerical component of the final equation clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates and displays the leading-order expression for the\n# Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling (u*) in phi^4 theory near four dimensions.\n\n# The derivation starts from the one-loop beta function in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions:\n# β(u) = -ϵ*u + b*u^2\n\n# The coefficient 'b' from the one-loop diagrammatic calculation is 3 / (16 * π^2).\ncoefficient_b_numerator = 3\ncoefficient_b_denominator = 16\n\n# A fixed point u* is found by setting β(u*) = 0 and solving for the non-trivial solution:\n# u* = ϵ / b\n\n# Substituting the value of b gives:\n# u* = ϵ / (3 / (16 * π^2))\n# which simplifies to:\n# u* = (16 * π^2 / 3) * ϵ\n\n# Let's define the components of the final expression.\nfinal_coefficient_numerator = 16\nfinal_coefficient_denominator = 3\npi_symbol = \"π\"\nepsilon_symbol = \"ϵ\"\n\nprint(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in the ϕ^4 theory near d=4 dimensions is:\")\n# We use an f-string to construct and print the final equation,\n# ensuring each number is explicitly shown as requested.\nprint(f\"u* = ({final_coefficient_numerator} * {pi_symbol}² / {final_coefficient_denominator}) * {epsilon_symbol}\")\n\n# For additional context, we calculate the approximate numerical value of the coefficient.\nnumerical_coefficient = (final_coefficient_numerator * math.pi**2) / final_coefficient_denominator\nprint(f\"\\nNumerically, the expression is approximately:\")\nprint(f\"u* ≈ {numerical_coefficient:.4f} * {epsilon_symbol}\")\n```\n<<<(16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
