    "Hello! That's a fascinating question that bridges theoretical physics, mathematics, and philosophy. The short answer is that it is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the customary mathematics of quantum mechanics. The reason is a fundamental mismatch between the domains and the tools they use.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Explain the Domains:** I'll first clarify what Gödel's Ontological Proof is (a system of formal, modal logic) and what the mathematics of quantum mechanics (QM) is (a framework for describing the physical universe).\n2.  **Highlight the Incompatibility:** I will point out that QM describes physical phenomena and makes testable predictions about the universe, while Gödel's proof is a purely abstract, logical argument whose validity depends on its axioms, not on empirical evidence. One cannot be used to prove the other; this is a \"category error.\"\n3.  **Illustrate with Code:** I will provide a Python script that doesn't actually perform a proof, but instead conceptually represents the two different domains. The code will define elements from both QM and Gödel's logic and then demonstrate, through its printed output, why there is no mathematical operator to connect them.\n4.  **Address the \"Final Equation\"**: Gödel's proof concludes with a logical formula, not a numerical equation. I will symbolically represent this final formula as requested, breaking it down into its constituent parts to satisfy the \"output each number\" constraint in a way that makes sense.\n\nHere is the Python script to illustrate this.\n\n```python\ndef explain_incompatibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    A conceptual script to illustrate why Quantum Mechanics cannot prove Gödel's Ontological Proof.\n    This script does not perform calculations, but rather uses code to structure the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Part 1: Define the Domain of Quantum Mechanics (QM) ---\n    # QM is a physical theory.
