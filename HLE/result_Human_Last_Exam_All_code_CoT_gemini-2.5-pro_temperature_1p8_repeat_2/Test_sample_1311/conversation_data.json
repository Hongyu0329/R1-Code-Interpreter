    "To determine the binding affinity of the specified compound to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), I will perform a search in the ChEMBL database, which is a large, public repository of bioactive drug-like small molecules. The compound in question is more commonly known by its developmental code name, SY-1365. I will use a Python script with the `chembl_webresource_client` library to find its activity data against human CDK7.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Use the ChEMBL API to search for the compound \"SY-1365\".\n2.  Search for the protein target \"Cyclin-dependent kinase 7\" from the organism \"Homo sapiens\".\n3.  Query the database for any recorded bioactivity between this compound and the target.\n4.  Filter the results for standard affinity measurements like IC50, Ki, or Kd.\n5.  Print the results and compare them to the given answer choices.\n\nThis script will install the required library if it's not already present.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\n# --- Installation of required library ---\ntry:\n    from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"chembl_webresource_client not found.
