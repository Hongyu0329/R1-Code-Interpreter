    # Step 1: Analyze the chemical structures of the two probes.
    print("Step 1: Analyze the Probes\n")
    print("Probe 1 has a '4-hydroxyphenyl' group, which is a phenol (-OH on a benzene ring).")
    print("Probe 2 has a '4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl' group, which is a benzyl alcohol (-CH2OH on a benzene ring).")
    print("This is the only difference between the two molecules. The rest of the structure, including the photo-activatable bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene core and the alkyne handle, is identical.\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze the experimental results.
    print("Step 2: Analyze the Experimental Outcome\n")
    print("The experiment is a photo-affinity labeling study. A probe is supposed to covalently bind to nearby proteins when exposed to light.")
    print("Result 1: With Probe 1 (phenol), there is a strong fluorescent signal in the light condition compared to the no-light condition.")
    print("Result 2: With Probe 2 (benzyl alcohol), the difference in signal is 'much lower'.")
    print("Conclusion: The phenol group in Probe 1 enables a much more efficient labeling reaction than the benzyl alcohol in Probe 2.\n")

    # Step 3: Deduce the underlying chemical mechanism.
    print("Step 3: Deduce the Chemical Mechanism\n")
    print("The key question is: What special reactivity does a phenol have under these conditions (light + photosensitizer) that a benzyl alcohol does not?")
    print("Phenols are known to be oxidized to form phenoxyl radicals. The photosensitizer absorbs light and can initiate this process.")
    print("A phenoxyl radical is a highly reactive species. It can abstract a hydrogen atom from a nearby amino acid side chain on a protein, creating a covalent link between the probe and the protein.")
    print("This radical-based mechanism is a known strategy for highly efficient proximity labeling.")
    print("The benzyl alcohol in Probe 2 cannot form a phenoxyl radical and lacks this efficient labeling pathway.\n")
    
    # Step 4: Evaluate the options.
    print("Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n")
    print("The question asks for the molecule that leads to the fluorescent difference. This means we are looking for the key species that is responsible for the high efficiency of Probe 1, and which is absent for Probe 2.")
    print("A. 2-fluoro-7-methoxy-9H-thioxanthen-9-one: The photosensitizer. It's required for the reaction but is present in both cases, so it doesn't explain the difference.")
    print("B. phenoxyl radical: This reactive species is formed from the phenol group of Probe 1 but not from the benzyl alcohol of Probe 2. Its presence directly accounts for the much stronger signal with Probe 1. This is the correct answer.")
    print("C. methyl (E)-4-oxo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-ylamino)but-2-enoate: This might be a byproduct from the degradation of the main scaffold, but it doesn't explain the dramatic difference caused by changing the phenol to a benzyl alcohol.")
    print("D. carbene: This is another type of reactive species, but it is not typically generated from this specific photocage and doesn't involve the phenol group.")
    print("E. cy5 azide: This is the fluorescent reporter molecule used for visualization *after* the labeling reaction. It doesn't cause the labeling itself.")

    print("-" * 70)
    print("Final Conclusion: The enhanced reactivity of the first probe is due to the formation of a phenoxyl radical, which is not possible for the second probe.")
