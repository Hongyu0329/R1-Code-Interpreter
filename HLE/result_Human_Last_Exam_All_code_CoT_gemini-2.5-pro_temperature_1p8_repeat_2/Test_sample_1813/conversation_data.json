    "To compute the continued fraction of the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to identify this number. The theory of generalized Markov numbers, also known as Markov-Hurwitz numbers, associates a number \\( m_r \\) to each rational number \\( r = p/q \\).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Represent the rational number** \\( r = 4/7 \\) by its standard continued fraction.\n    \\( 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n2.  **Construct a periodic continued fraction**. Following the standard definition, we create a palindromic sequence from the partial quotients of \\( r \\): \\( (1, 1, 3, 1, 1) \\). We then consider the purely periodic continued fraction \\(\\xi = [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 1, 1}]\\).\n3.  **Determine the generalized Markov number**. The generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is defined as the Lagrange constant of \\(\\xi\\). This constant is given by \\(\\sqrt{D}/P\\), where \\(\\xi\\) is the positive root of the quadratic equation \\(Px^2 + Qx + R = 0\\). The matrix for the periodic block \\((1,1,3,1,1)\\) is \\( M = \\begin{pmatrix} 16 & 9 \\\\ 9 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The quadratic \\(\\xi = \\frac{16\\xi + 9}{9\\xi + 5}\\) leads to the equation \\(9\\xi^2 - 11\\xi - 9 = 0\\). The discriminant is \\(D = (-11)^2 - 4(9)(-9) = 121 + 324 = 445\\). The generalized Markov number is \\(m_{4/7} = \\frac{\\sqrt{445}}{9}\\).\n4.  **Compute the continued fraction of \\( m_{4/7} \\)**. We will use the standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational. This requires integer arithmetic to maintain precision. We express \\(m_{4/7}\\) as \\( \\frac{P_0 + \\sqrt{D_{cf}}}{Q_0} \\) where \\(P_0, D_{cf}, Q_0\\) are integers. Let \\(m = \\frac{\\sqrt{445}}{9} = \\frac{\\sqrt{445 \\cdot 9^2}}{9^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{36045}}{81}\\). The algorithm proceeds by generating a sequence of partial quotients until a state \\((P_n, Q_n)\\) repeats.\n5.  **Present the result**. The final output will show the value of \\( m_{4/7} \\) and its computed continued fraction expansion.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction of the generalized Markov number m_4/7.\n\n    The generalized Markov number m_{p/q} is defined via the Lagrange constant\n    of a related periodic continued fraction.
