# This script calculates the value of the expression from the problem.
# The final expression is of the form: (numerator / denominator) + addend
# We will calculate each part and print them.

# From the derivation, we know that ||alpha||^2 = 0.5 * ( (pi^2/6) - 1 ).
# The numerator of the expression is 2 * ||alpha||^2.
# Numerator = 2 * 0.5 * ( (pi^2/6) - 1 ) = (pi^2/6) - 1.

# 1. Calculate the denominator part: (pi^2/6) - 1
pi_squared_over_6 = math.pi**2 / 6
denominator = pi_squared_over_6 - 1

# 2. Calculate the numerator part: 2 * ||alpha||^2
# Based on our derivation, this simplifies to be the same as the denominator.
numerator = denominator

# 3. The additive term is 10^15.
addend = 10**15

# Print the components of the final equation.
# Final equation: (numerator / denominator) + addend = Result
print(f"The equation to solve is: ( {numerator} / {denominator} ) + {addend}")
print("Where:")
print(f"Numerator = {numerator}")
print(f"Denominator = {denominator}")
print(f"Addend = {addend}")
print("-" * 20)


# 4. Calculate the final result
# The fraction numerator/denominator simplifies to 1.
# We perform the numerical calculation to show this.
if denominator != 0:
    result = (numerator / denominator) + addend
    # The result will be a float, we cast it to a long integer for exact representation.
