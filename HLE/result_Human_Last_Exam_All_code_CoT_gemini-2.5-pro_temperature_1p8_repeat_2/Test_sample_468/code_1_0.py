# The genus Perdita is a large group of small bees native to North and Central America.
# Due to their tiny size, they have been given a fitting common name.
# Research indicates that the name "Fairy bees" was popularized in the book
# "Bees of the World" by Christopher O'Toole and Anthony Raw.
# The first edition of this influential book was published in 1991.
