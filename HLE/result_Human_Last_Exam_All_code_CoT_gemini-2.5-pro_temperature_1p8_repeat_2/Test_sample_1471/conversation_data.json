I will first translate each of them into modern Arabic numerals.\n    *   ` <ctrl42> `: This symbol is technically not a number in the Egyptian system; it is a determinative for \"enemy\" or \"captive\". Since the equation is unsolvable otherwise, I will assume this is a stand-in for a number that makes the equation work neatly. A common practice in such puzzles is to choose a number that results in a simple integer answer. I will test a few possibilities.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒌋`: The symbol `𒌋` represents 10. Seeing it three times (`𒌋𒌋𒌋`) means 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹`: This is a combination of `𒌋` (10) and `𒁹` (1). Two `𒌋` symbols and three `𒁹` symbols mean (10 + 10) + (1 + 1 + 1) = 23.\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** The equation now is `? / 30 - 23 = ?`.\n3.  **Deduce the Missing Number:** For the division `? / 30` to be a clean integer, the unknown number should be a multiple of 30. A logical choice that creates a simple calculation is 420, since `420 / 30 = 14`.\n4.  **Solve the Final Equation:** I will substitute 420 for the unknown symbol. The equation becomes `420 / 30 - 23`.\n5.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation and its result.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the equation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the numbers from the equation.\n# The symbol ' <ctrl42> ' is not a numeral. We assume it represents 420\n# to make the division by 30 result in an integer.\nnum1 = 420\n\n# The symbol '𒌋𒌋𒌋' represents 30 in Egyptian numerals (10+10+10).\nnum2 = 30\n\n# The symbol '𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹' represents 23 (10+10+1+1+1).\nnum3 = 23\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the result of the division.\ndivision_result = int(num1 / num2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final result of the subtraction.\nfinal_result = division_result - num3\n\n# Step 4: Print the full equation in modern numbers and the final answer.\nprint(f\"Solving the equation based on our interpretation:\")\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {final_result}\")\n\n```\n<<<-9>>>"
