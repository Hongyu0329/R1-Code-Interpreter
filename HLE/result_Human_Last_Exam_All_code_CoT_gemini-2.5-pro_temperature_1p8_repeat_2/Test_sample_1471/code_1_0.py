# Step 1: Define the numbers from the equation.
# The symbol ' <ctrl42> ' is not a numeral. We assume it represents 420
# to make the division by 30 result in an integer.
num1 = 420

# The symbol '𒌋𒌋𒌋' represents 30 in Egyptian numerals (10+10+10).
num2 = 30

# The symbol '𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹' represents 23 (10+10+1+1+1).
num3 = 23

# Step 2: Calculate the result of the division.
division_result = int(num1 / num2)

# Step 3: Calculate the final result of the subtraction.
final_result = division_result - num3

# Step 4: Print the full equation in modern numbers and the final answer.
print(f"Solving the equation based on our interpretation:")
print(f"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {final_result}")
