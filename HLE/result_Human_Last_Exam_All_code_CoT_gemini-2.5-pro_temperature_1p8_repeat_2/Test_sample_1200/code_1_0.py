    Explains the genetic alterations leading to copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH).

Analysis of the Question:
The question asks for the genetic alteration that leads to two specific outcomes in a tumor cell:
1.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH): A cell starts with two different alleles for a gene (e.g., one normal, one mutant) and ends up with only one type of allele (e.g., two mutant alleles).
2.  Copy-Neutral: The total number of copies of the chromosome where the gene resides remains the same (usually two).

Evaluating the Answer Choices:
*   A. Mitotic recombination: This is a mechanism that can cause copy-neutral LOH. It involves a crossover between chromosomes during mitosis, which can lead to daughter cells that are homozygous for one of the alleles while remaining diploid. It is a valid cause.
*   B. A deletion of a chromosomal region: This causes LOH but is not copy-neutral. The cell loses a copy of the gene, resulting in a copy number of one (hemizygosity).
*   C. Trisomy: This is a copy number gain (three copies), not copy-neutral.
*   E. Duplication of a chromosomal region: This is also a copy number gain, not copy-neutral.

Comparing the best candidates (A and D):
*   Both Mitotic recombination (A) and Uniparental disomy (D) are related to copy-neutral LOH. However, 'Uniparental Disomy' (UPD) is the term that best describes the resulting state.
*   UPD is the state of having two homologous chromosomes derived from a single parent. In the context of a tumor, this can happen somatically through a process of chromosome loss followed by duplication.
*   Let's analyze this process:
    1. A heterozygous cell loses the chromosome copy containing the normal allele. This is the "allele deletion" part of the question. The cell is now hemizygous.
    2. To restore stability, the cell duplicates the remaining chromosome (the one with the mutant allele). This "maintains the gene dosage" by bringing the copy number back to two.
*   This entire process results in a state of uniparental disomy, which is the perfect example of copy-neutral LOH. Therefore, it is the most complete and accurate answer.
