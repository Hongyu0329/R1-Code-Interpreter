    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button, followed by the Python code to present the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The situation is a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game. The action is an open-raise from the button (BTN). The button is the most powerful position in poker, allowing for the widest opening range.\n2.  **Evaluate \"Suited Jack\" Hands:** A \"suited Jack\" hand is a Jack and another card of the same suit (JXs). The strength of these hands is primarily determined by the rank of the second card (the \"kicker\") and its \"connectivity\" (how close it is to the Jack for making straights).\n3.  **Rank the Hands:** Based on kicker strength and connectivity, we can rank all suited Jacks from best to worst: JAs is the best (highest kicker), followed by JKs, JQs, JTs (best connectivity), down to J3s and J2s. J2s is objectively the weakest hand in this category due to its low kicker and the large \"gap\" that makes forming a straight very unlikely.\n4.  **Consult GTO Strategy:** Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers provide standard opening ranges for these situations. For a 100BB cash game, a standard GTO button opening range is very wide (often 45-50% of hands). This range includes *all* suited Jacks, from JAs down to J2s. The positional advantage and the potential to make a strong flush make even the weakest suited Jacks profitable to open.\n5.  **Identify the \"Worst\":** Since GTO strategy recommends opening *all* suited Jacks from the button, the \"worst one you should open\" is simply the weakest hand within that group. As established in step 3, that hand is J2s.\n6.  **Develop Python Code:** I will write a Python script that defines all suited Jack hands, sorts them from best to worst based on poker hand rankings, and then selects the last hand from that list as the \"worst\" viable open.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_openable_hand():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button\n    in a standard 100BB cash game scenario.\n\n    In poker, hand strength for suited hands is determined by high card value\n    and connectivity (ability to make straights). We can rank kickers accordingly.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the ranks in order from best to worst for kickers.\n    ranks = ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'T', '9', '8', '7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2']\n\n    # Generate all suited Jack (JXs) hands.\n    # Note: JJs would be a pair, not a suited jack combo like JXs.\n    all_suited_jacks = [f\"J{r}s\" for r in ranks]\n\n    # According to standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts for a 100BB cash game,\n    # ALL suited jacks are considered a profitable open-raise from the button due to\n    # the immense positional advantage.\n    button_opening_range = all_suited_jacks\n\n    # The \"worst\" hand to open is the one at the bottom of the hand strength ranking.\n    # Since the 'ranks' list is already sorted from best to worst, the last\n    # hand in our generated list `button_opening_range` will be the weakest.\n    worst_hand_to_open = button_opening_range[-1]\n\n    print(f\"All suited Jacks are standard opens from the button in a 100BB game.\")\n    print(f\"The hands, ranked from best to worst, are: {', '.join(button_opening_range)}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe worst suited Jack that you should still open is therefore the weakest in the category.\")\n    print(f\"Worst Hand: {worst_hand_to_open}\")\n\nfind_worst_openable_hand()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
