# The correct answer is C. This choice accurately describes the standard method for isolating
# a corneal fibroblast cell line. The process involves debriding (removing) the epithelium
# and endothelium to isolate the stroma. The stromal cells are then cultured.
# In culture, especially with serum, these cells proliferate and differentiate into
# fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. They must adhere to the culture flask to grow.
# The medium composition described in C, with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) and
# 1% antibiotics, represents a standard, effective formulation for this purpose.

# The script below uses the numerical values from the correct option (C).
fbs_percentage = 10
antibiotic_percentage = 1
