    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, we will employ the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard method for quantizing 2-player, 2-strategy games.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Represent the Game:** We'll define the payoff matrix, the basis states for Cooperate (`|C⟩`) and Defect (`|D⟩`), and the classical strategies as quantum operators.\n2.  **Quantum Setup:** We'll construct the EWL protocol framework. This involves an initial maximally entangled state created by an operator `J`, local strategy application by players, and a final disentangling operation `J†`.\n3.  **Identify the Quantum Strategy:** In the quantum version of the game, a new strategy `Q` becomes available. This strategy is distinct from the classical Cooperate (`C`) and Defect (`D`).\n4.  **Calculate Payoffs:** We will write a function to calculate the expected payoffs for any pair of strategies by determining the probabilities of the four classical outcomes (`CC`, `CD`, `DC`, `DD`) after the quantum evolution.\n5.  **Find the Nash Equilibrium:** We will demonstrate that the strategy profile where both players choose `Q`, i.e., `(Q, Q)`, is a Nash Equilibrium. We'll do this by:\n    *   Calculating the payoff for `(Q, Q)`.\n    *   Showing that if one player unilaterally deviates to `D` or `C`, their payoff will decrease.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The equilibrium point in the quantum game yields a payoff that resolves the classical dilemma. We will identify this payoff value. The Python code below will perform these calculations and print the full equations for clarity.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the Nash Equilibrium in a quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
