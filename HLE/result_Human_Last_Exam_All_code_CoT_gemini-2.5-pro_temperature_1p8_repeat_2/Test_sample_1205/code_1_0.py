    Analyzes the C++ code to determine the minimum number of vptr and vfunction loads.
    """
    explanation = """
Step-by-step analysis:
1. a->foo(): The first virtual call requires a fresh dispatch.
   - Load vptr from 'a': 1 vptr load.
   - Load function pointer for 'foo' from vtable: 1 vfunction load.

2. escape(a): This function acts as a compiler barrier. The compiler must discard
   any cached information about the object at 'a', as its dynamic type might have changed.

3. a->bar(): Because of the escape(), the compiler cannot reuse the previous vptr.
   It must perform a new dispatch.
   - Load vptr from 'a': 1 vptr load.
   - Load function pointer for 'bar' from vtable: 1 vfunction load.

4. std::launder(a): This also serves as a compiler barrier, telling the compiler that
   the storage at 'a' might contain a new object. All previous assumptions are invalidated.

5. b->foo(): A call on the laundered pointer requires another fresh dispatch.
   - Load vptr from 'b': 1 vptr load.
   - Load function pointer for 'foo' from vtable: 1 vfunction load.

The code is specifically structured to prevent optimizations that would reduce these loads.
