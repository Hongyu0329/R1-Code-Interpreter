    "To solve this problem, we will calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Formula**: The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a weighted homogeneous polynomial singularity with $n$ variables, weights $(w_1, ..., w_n)$, and degree $d$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ c = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(1 - \\frac{2w_i}{d}\\right) $$\n2.  **Determine the Parameters**:\n    *   The number of variables is $n=5$, corresponding to $(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$.\n    *   The weights are given as $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n3.  **Find the Degree (d)**: For a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its degree $d$ must equal the sum of the weights of the ambient space.\n    *   $d = \\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   *Note*: The provided polynomial $f = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$ appears to contain a typo in the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, which has a weighted degree of 224, while all other terms have a degree of 225. Based on the Calabi-Yau condition, we proceed with the correct degree $d=225$.\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant**: Substitute the values of $n$, $w_i$, and $d$ into the formula and perform the arithmetic step-by-step. The Python code below will carry out and display this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Weights for the variables (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    n = len(weights)\n\n    # For a Calabi-Yau manifold, the degree d is the sum of the weights.\n    # This is a defining condition that resolves the apparent typo in the polynomial.\n    d = sum(weights)\n\n    print(\"To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant, we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"c = Σ (1 - 2*w_i / d) for i=1 to n\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Given weights w = {tuple(weights)}\")\n    print(f\"The number of variables is n = {n}\")\n    \n    # Show the calculation of the degree d\n    sum_of_weights_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    print(f\"For a Calabi-Yau link, the degree d equals the sum of the weights:\")\n    print(f\"d = {sum_of_weights_str} = {d}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Substitute values into the formula ---\n    step1_terms = [f\"(1 - 2*{w}/{d})\" for w in weights]\n    print(\"Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula\")\n    print(\"c = \" + \" + \".join(step1_terms))\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Simplify the 2*w_i part ---\n    step2_numerators = [2 * w for w in weights]\n    step2_terms = [f\"(1 - {num}/{d})\" for num in step2_numerators]\n    print(\"Step 2: Perform the multiplication in the numerator\")\n    print(\"c = \" + \" + \".join(step2_terms))\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Combine terms inside the parentheses ---\n    step3_numerators = [d - num for num in step2_numerators]\n    step3_terms = [f\"({num}/{d})\" for num in step3_numerators]\n    print(\"Step 3: Perform the subtraction inside the parentheses\")\n    print(\"c = \" + \" + \".join(step3_terms))\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Combine into a single fraction ---\n    step4_numerator_str = \" + \".join(map(str, step3_numerators))\n    print(\"Step 4: Combine into a single fraction\")\n    print(f\"c = ({step4_numerator_str}) / {d}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # --- Step 5: Sum the numerators ---\n    sum_of_numerators = sum(step3_numerators)\n    print(\"Step 5: Sum the numbers in the numerator\")\n    print(f\"c = {sum_of_numerators} / {d}\")\n    print(\"\")\n    \n    # --- Step 6: Final Division ---\n    final_result = sum_of_numerators / d\n    print(\"Step 6: Perform the final division\")\n    # Use sys.stdout.write to avoid adding a newline, matching the requested format.\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"c = {int(final_result)}\")\n\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n# The final answer is enclosed below as requested.\n# The code above calculates and prints the derivation.\nprint(\"\\n\") # Add a newline for separation before the final answer tag\nprint(\"<<<3>>>\")\n```"
