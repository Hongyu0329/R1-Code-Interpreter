    # The question asks for the primary influences on Pannenberg's concept of cosmic history
    # and contingent time, especially in his later work engaging with physics.

    # Analysis of Influences:
    # 1. Georg Hegel: Pannenberg's foundational "theology of history" is a direct and
    #    critical reinterpretation of Hegel's philosophy of history. Pannenberg argues,
    #    like Hegel, that the meaning of history is revealed from its end. For Pannenberg,
    #    this end is the eschaton, revealed proleptically in the resurrection of Jesus.
    #    This covers the "reinterpretation of history" part of the prompt.

    # 2. Friedrich Schelling: In his later work, as Pannenberg engaged with modern physics
    #    (like field theory), he found a powerful resource in Schelling's "Naturphilosophie".
    #    Schelling's philosophy provided a way to think about nature as a dynamic, developing
    #    system and God's relationship to a contingent world, which aligns perfectly with
    #    the "cosmic history," "engage with physics," and "contingent concept of time."

    # Matching with Options:
    # The combination of "Georg Hegel" and "Friedrich Schelling" corresponds to option E.
    correct_option_letter = "E"
    correct_option_text = "George Hegel and Friedrich Schelling"

    print("1. Georg Hegel's philosophy of history is the primary framework for Pannenberg's argument that history must be understood from its future completion (the eschaton).")
    print("2. Friedrich Schelling's philosophy of nature (Naturphilosophie) was crucial for Pannenberg's later work to integrate theology with modern physics and develop a concept of 'cosmic history' based on contingency.")
    print("\nTherefore, the two thinkers Pannenberg primarily draws upon for this specific argument are Hegel and Schelling.")
