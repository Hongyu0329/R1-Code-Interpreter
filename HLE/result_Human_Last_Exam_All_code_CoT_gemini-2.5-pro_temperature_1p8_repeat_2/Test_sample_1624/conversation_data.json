    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given properties of the subset U.**\n    The problem states that $U$ is an open subset of $X$ and every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This is the definition of a 1-dimensional topological manifold. So, $U$ is a 1-manifold.\n    Since $X$ is a metric space, its subspace $U$ is also a metrizable space.\n    A key theorem in topology states that any metrizable manifold is also second-countable. A space is second-countable if it has a countable basis for its topology.\n\n2.  **Relate the properties of U to the entire space X.**\n    A second-countable space is always separable. A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset. To see why, one can construct a countable dense subset by choosing one point from each non-empty set in the countable basis.\n    So, $U$ is separable. Let's call its countable dense subset $D$.\n    We are given that $U$ is a dense subset of $X$. Since $D$ is dense in $U$ and $U$ is dense in $X$, it follows that $D$ is also dense in $X$.\n    This means $X$ contains a countable dense subset, so $X$ is a separable metric space.\n\n3.  **Determine the cardinality of a separable metric space.**\n    A fundamental result in the theory of metric spaces is that any separable metric space can have a cardinality of at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum (which is the cardinality of the set of real numbers, $|\\mathbb{R}|$). This can be proven by constructing an injective (one-to-one) function from the space $X$ into the space of sequences of real numbers, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the logic above, the space $X$ must be a separable metric space. Therefore, its cardinality is bounded above by the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. This bound is achievable, for example, by letting $X = \\mathbb{R}$ and $U = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the upper bound on the cardinality of the space X.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Introduction to the problem's conditions\n    print(\"The problem asks for an upper bound on the cardinality of a connected metric space X,\")\n    print(\"which contains a dense open subset U where every point is locally homeomorphic to R.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the properties of the subset U\n    print(\"Step 1: Characterize the subspace U.\")\n    print(\"The condition that each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R means that U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\")\n    print(\"Since U is a subspace of the metric space X, U is metrizable.\")\n    print(\"A key theorem states that any metrizable manifold is second-countable (has a countable basis).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Show that X is separable\n    print(\"Step 2: Establish that X is a separable space.\")\n    print(\"Any second-countable space is also separable (contains a countable dense subset).\")\n    print(\"Let D be a countable dense subset of U.
