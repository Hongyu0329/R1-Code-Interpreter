    # Initial state of the directory (as a set for easy addition)

    # --- Execution Trace ---
    
    # 1. To build 'all', `make` first evaluates 'T'.
    # 2. To build 'T', `make` evaluates its dependencies 'Opps' and 'X'.
    
    # 2a. Building 'Opps':
    #    - The circular dependency `Opps <- T` is dropped by `make`.
    #    - The effective rule is `Opps: Z`.
    #    - File 'Opps' does not exist, so its command `touch T` is run.
    files.add('T')
    
    # 2b. Building 'X':
    #    - The rule is `X: Y`.
    #    - The timestamp of 'X' (10:51) is older than 'Y' (10:52), so the rule runs.
    #    - Command `touch B` is run.
    files.add('B')

    # 2c. Building 'T' itself:
    #    - Rule is `T: Opps X`.
    #    - Since its prerequisites 'Opps' and 'X' were just rebuilt, 'T' is out of date.
    #    - Command `touch A` is run.
    files.add('A')

    # 3. The other dependencies of `all` (`Z`, `X`, `Opps`) have already been processed.
    # 4. The command for `all` (`ls`) runs but does not change the set of files.

    # 5. Determine the final sorted list of files.
    final_files = sorted(list(files))
    
    print(", ".join(final_files))
