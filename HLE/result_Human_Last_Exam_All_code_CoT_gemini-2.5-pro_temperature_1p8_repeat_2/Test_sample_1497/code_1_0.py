def solve_violin_parameters():
    """
    This function determines the parameter group corresponding to each violin playing variation
    and the direction of change for a specific parameter.

    The analysis is as follows:
    1.  Variation (1) 'sul ponticello': Bowing near the bridge enhances higher harmonics.
        This changes the harmonic decay profile, controlled by parameter group ii (ν).
    2.  Variation (2) 'bridge mute': A mute adds mass to the bridge, damping and lowering its
        resonance frequency. This primarily affects the bridge resonance parameters in group iv (μ, a_2, f_2).
        The added mass causes the resonance frequency (f_2) to go 'down'.
    3.  Variation (3) 'helium room': The speed of sound in helium is much higher than in air, which
        increases the frequency of the violin's internal air resonance, represented by group iii (a_1, f_1).
    4.  Variation (4) 'on the E string': Changing from the A string to the E string changes the
        fundamental frequency of the open string, which is parameter F from group i.

    The final answer is a comma-separated string of the group identifiers in order, followed by the direction.
