    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I need to determine the formula for calculating the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Terraria's Expert Mode. This involves finding its base health and how it scales with the number of players.\n\n1.  **Find Base Stats:** I will start with the Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Classic Mode and the multiplier applied in Expert Mode for a single player.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I will find the specific formula used in Expert Mode to increase the boss's health for each additional player in a multiplayer world.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The question specifies an infinite number of players. I will apply this condition to the health formula. A simple linear formula would mathematically approach infinity.\n4.  **Identify the True Limit:** The crucial part of the phrase \"According to the source code\" is that computer programs have hard limits based on data types. The theoretical maximum health is not infinite but is capped by the maximum value of the variable type used to store NPC health in the game's code, which is a 32-bit signed integer.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that calculates this maximum value (2^31 - 1). The script will also display the base parameters for the boss's health to provide context and will present the final calculation as an equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_terraria_health_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode\n    with an infinite number of players, based on data type limitations in the game's code.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu's health calculation.\n    base_health_classic = 2800\n    expert_mode_multiplier = 1.3\n    health_per_player_scaling_factor = 0.35\n    base_health_expert = int(base_health_classic * expert_mode_multiplier)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the scaling formula and the concept of the theoretical limit.\n    print(\"In Terraria's Expert Mode, a boss's health scales with the number of players.\")\n    print(f\"The Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode for one player is {base_health_expert}.\")\n    print(f\"For each additional player, the total health is increased by a factor of {health_per_player_scaling_factor} (35%).\")\n    print(f\"The formula is: Total Health = {base_health_expert} * (1 + {health_per_player_scaling_factor} * (PlayerCount - 1))\\n\")\n    print(\"With an infinite number of players, this formula would mathematically approach infinity.\")\n    print(\"However, the game's source code stores NPC health in a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    print(\"This data type has a hard-coded maximum value, which represents the true theoretical maximum health for any entity in the game.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate and display the final equation for this maximum value.\n    # The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2 to the power of 31, minus 1.\n    power = 31\n    base = 2\n    subtract = 1\n    theoretical_max_health = (base ** power) - subtract\n\n    print(\"The final equation for the theoretical maximum health is determined by this data type limit:\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical Max Health = {base} ** {power} - {subtract} = {theoretical_max_health:,}\")\n\n\ncalculate_terraria_health_limit()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
