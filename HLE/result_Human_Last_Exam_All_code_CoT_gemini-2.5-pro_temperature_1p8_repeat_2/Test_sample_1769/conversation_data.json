    "This is a fascinating question of alternate linguistic history. To solve this, we need to remove the Old Norse influence and trace the evolution of the original Old English word for \"sister\".\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify the Source of \"Sister\"**: The current word \"sister\" entered English from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" brought by Viking invaders.\n2.  **Find the Original Old English Word**: Before the Norse influence, the native word in Old English (Anglo-Saxon) was \"sweostor.\"\n3.  **Trace its Natural Evolution**: We will trace how \"sweostor\" would have changed over time, following the same sound shifts that affected other native English words.\n    *   In Middle English, complex sounds were often simplified. \"Sweostor\" became \"suster,\" a form used by writers like Chaucer.\n    *   During the Great Vowel Shift, the pronunciation of the 'u' in \"suster\" (pronounced like the 'u' in \"put\") would have shifted to the sound of the 'u' in \"cut.\"\n4.  **Determine the Modern Form**: Based on this evolution, the spelling and pronunciation would lead to the modern word \"suster.\" This is supported by looking at related languages untouched by Norse, like Dutch (\"zuster\") and German (\"Schwester\").\n\nThe following Python code simulates this deduction and prints the final result.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines the Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    if the Old Norse language had not influenced Old English.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The current word, \"sister\", comes from Old Norse.\n    norse_origin = \"systir\"\n    \n    # The original Old English word was \"sweostor\".\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    \n    # In Middle English, this word simplified to \"suster\".\n    middle_english_form = \"suster\"\n    \n    # Following natural English linguistic evolution (like the Great Vowel Shift),\n    # this form would have become the modern word.\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"suster\"\n    \n    print(f\"The word 'sister' comes from Old Norse ('{norse_origin}').\")\n    print(f\"Without that influence, the Old English word '{old_english_word}' would have been used.\")\n    print(f\"This would have evolved through Middle English ('{middle_english_form}') into the modern word:\")\n    print(f\"\\n{hypothetical_modern_word}\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
