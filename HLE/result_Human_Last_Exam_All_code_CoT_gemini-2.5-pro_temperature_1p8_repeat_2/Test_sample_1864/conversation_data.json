    "For your flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data and successful sorting. The total number of controls depends on the number of fluorescent channels you are using. Here is the breakdown and calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Core Controls:** Determine the essential categories of controls for any multi-color flow cytometry experiment: unstained controls, compensation controls, and Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls.\n2.  **Calculate Controls per Category:**\n    *   **Unstained Control:** This is always a single sample to measure the baseline fluorescence (autofluorescence) of your beads.\n    *   **Compensation Controls:** You need one single-stain control for each fluorochrome in your panel to correct for spectral overlap. Since you have five channels, you will need five compensation controls.\n    *   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting. An FMO control contains all stains except for one, and you need one FMO for each of the five channels.\n3.  **Sum the Totals:** Add the number of controls from each category to find the total number of essential control tubes.\n4.  **Generate Code:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print a clear explanation of each control's purpose, along with the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorochromes/channels in the experiment\n    num_colors = 5\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # --- Control Calculation ---\n\n    # 1.
