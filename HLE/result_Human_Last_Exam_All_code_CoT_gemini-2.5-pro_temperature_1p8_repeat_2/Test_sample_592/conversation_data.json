    "I will answer your question by providing the information in a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the main character, Tommaso, from the 1997 movie *Ovosodo*.\n2.  Research the plot of the movie to determine the US city he moves to.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores the city name in a variable.\n4.  Use the `print` function to display the answer in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\n# Information about the movie \"Ovosodo\" (1997)\nmovie_title = \"Ovosodo\"\ncharacter_name = \"Tommaso\"\n\n# According to the plot of the movie, Tommaso moves to a specific US city.\nus_city = \"San Francisco\"\n\n# Print the answer to the user's question.\nprint(f\"In the movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} moves to {us_city}, USA.\")\n```\n<<<San Francisco>>>"
