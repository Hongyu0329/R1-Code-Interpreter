# The initial state includes a circle (C0), its center (A), and a point on its circumference (B).

# 1. Draw a line through the center A and point B. This line is a diameter.
#    It intersects the original circle C0 at point B and a new point, D.
#    Command: L
L1 = "L"

# 2. Draw a circle with center B and a radius equal to the distance BD.
#    Command: C
C1 = "C"

# 3. Draw another circle with center D and a radius equal to the distance DB.
#    This circle and the one from step 2 will intersect at two new points, E and F.
#    Command: C
C2 = "C"

# 4. Draw a line through the intersection points E and F. This line is the
#    perpendicular bisector of the diameter BD and thus forms the second diameter
#    of the circle. The intersections of this line with the original circle C0
#    give the remaining two vertices of the square.
#    Command: L
L2 = "L"

# The sequence of commands constructs the vertices of the inscribed square.
construction_sequence = L1 + C1 + C2 + L2
print(construction_sequence)

# The final answer format is just the sequence of letters.
# The explanation above clarifies the steps taken to arrive at this shortest sequence.
# This print statement is for displaying the final answer in the required format.
