    """
    This function derives and prints the expressions for the total volume and surface charges
    for the given concentric cylindrical electrode problem.

    The derivation is based on first principles:
    1. E-field from V = -integral(E.dl) and div(J)=0 for DC steady state.
    2. Volume charge from Gauss's law (rho = div(D)).
    3. Surface charges from the boundary condition (sigma_s = n . D).

    The derived quantities are self-consistent (total charge is zero).
    It should be noted that the provided answer choices appear to be inconsistent or contain typos,
    as only one term in option B matches this rigorous derivation.
