    Calculates the theoretical maximum FAIR compliance score (R) for a federated
    knowledge graph system based on given parameters.

    The model assumes:
    - R is the average of Findability (f), Accessibility (a), Interoperability (i), 
      and Reusability (r), each scored 0-10.
    - Accessibility (a) is perfect (10) as no constraints were given.
    - Findability (f), Interoperability (i), and Reusability (r) are limited by:
        1. Identifier consistency (c), setting a score ceiling of 10 * c.
        2. Versioning complexity from branching (b), applying a logarithmic penalty of ln(b).
