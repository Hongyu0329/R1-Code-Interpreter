    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic part of the target superspace for the sigma-model. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Space:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the supersymmetric sigma-model is defined on a target space which is the supermanifold `O(2N_rep|2N_rep) / (O(N_rep|N_rep) x O(N_rep|N_rep))`, where `N_rep` is the number of replicas.\n2.  **Isolate the Bosonic Sector:** The non-Grassman (bosonic) variables parametrize the bosonic submanifold of this target space. For class D, this bosonic part is the symmetric space `M = G/H`, where `G = O(2*N_rep)` and `H = O(N_rep) x O(N_rep)`.\n3.  **Calculate the Dimension:** The number of variables is the dimension of this manifold, `dim(M)`. This is calculated as `dim(M) = dim(G) - dim(H)`.\n4.  **Use Dimension Formulas:** The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(n)` is `n*(n-1)/2`.\n    *   `dim(G) = dim(O(2*N_rep)) = (2*N_rep)*(2*N_rep-1)/2`.\n    *   `dim(H) = dim(O(N_rep)) + dim(O(N_rep)) = 2 * [N_rep*(N_rep-1)/2]`.\n5.  **Substitute and Compute:** We will set the number of replicas `N_rep` to 2, as specified in the problem, and compute the final numerical result. The final calculation will be `dim(O(4)) - dim(O(2)xO(2))`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, calculating the dimension and printing the final equation with all the numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Number of replicas\nN = 2\n\n# The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model\n# of symmetry class D is given by the dimension of the corresponding bosonic symmetric space.\n# For N replicas, this space is O(2*N) / (O(N) x O(N)).\n# The dimension is calculated as: dim(O(2*N)) - dim(O(N) x O(N)).\n\n# The dimension of the orthogonal group O(n) is n*(n-1)/2.\n\n# Dimension of the group G = O(2*N)\ngroup_G_dim = (2 * N) * (2 * N - 1) // 2\n\n# Dimension of the subgroup H = O(N) x O(N)\n# The dimension of a direct product of groups is the sum of their dimensions.\n# dim(H) = dim(O(N)) + dim(O(N)) = 2 * dim(O(N))\nsubgroup_H_dim = 2 * (N * (N - 1) // 2)\n\n# The result is the dimension of the quotient space G/H.\nresult = group_G_dim - subgroup_H_dim\n\n# --- Output the result as requested ---\nprint(f\"The problem is to find the number of non-Grassman variables for a model with N={N} replicas in symmetry class D.\")\nprint(\"This number is the dimension of the symmetric space O(2N)/[O(N)xO(N)].\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: dim(O({2*N})) - (dim(O({N})) + dim(O({N})))\")\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we calculate the dimension of the individual groups:\")\nprint(f\"dim(O({2*N})) = ({2*N}*({2*N}-1))/2 = {group_G_dim}\")\nprint(f\"dim(O({N})) = ({N}*({N}-1))/2 = {N * (N - 1) // 2}\")\nprint(f\"So, dim(O({N})xO({N})) = {subgroup_H_dim}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinally, we subtract the subgroup dimension from the group dimension.\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{group_G_dim} - {subgroup_H_dim} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
