    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (or square) lattice, which is denoted by a(10). A self-avoiding walk is a path on a grid that starts at the origin and does not visit the same point more than once.\n\nMy plan to solve this is to use a recursive backtracking algorithm, which is a form of depth-first search. Here are the steps:\n\n1.  **Define the State:** A walk can be defined by its current position `(x, y)` on the grid and the set of all points it has visited so far.\n2.  **Start the Walk:** The walk begins at the origin `(0, 0)` with 0 steps taken. The initial path contains only this single point.\n3.  **Recursive Exploration:** From the current point, I will explore its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n4.  **Check for Self-Intersection:** For each neighbor, I'll check if it has already been visited. If it has, that path is invalid and we discard it.\n5.  **Recurse:** If a neighbor is a valid next step (i.e., not visited), I will move to that neighbor, add it to our path, and recursively call the function to continue the walk from this new point, incrementing the step count.\n6.  **Backtrack:** After a recursive call returns, I must \"undo\" the move by removing the point from the path. This allows other paths to use that point.\n7.  **Base Case:** The recursion stops when the walk has reached the desired length of 10 steps. When this happens, we have successfully found one valid self-avoiding walk, and we return 1.\n8.  **Summation:** The total number of walks is the sum of all valid walks found from each of the initial four directions.\n\nThis approach will systematically explore every possible 10-step path and count only the ones that do not self-intersect. I will implement this logic in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks\n    on a square lattice, starting from the origin.\n\n    It uses a recursive backtracking algorithm (a type of depth-first search)\n    to explore all possible valid paths.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The desired number of steps for the walk.\n    num_steps = 10\n\n    # The `path` set keeps track of visited coordinates for efficient O(1) checking.\n    # We initialize the path with the starting point, the origin (0, 0).\n    path = {(0, 0)}\n\n    def count_walks(x, y, steps_taken):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid walks from the current position (x, y).\n\n        Args:\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_taken (int): The number of steps taken so far.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks from this point.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If we have taken the required number of steps,\n        # we have found one complete, valid walk.\n        if steps_taken == num_steps:\n            return 1\n\n        # Recursive step:\n        count = 0\n        # Explore the four neighbors: North (0,1), South (0,-1), East (1,0), West (-1,0).\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n\n            # Check if the neighbor has been visited.
