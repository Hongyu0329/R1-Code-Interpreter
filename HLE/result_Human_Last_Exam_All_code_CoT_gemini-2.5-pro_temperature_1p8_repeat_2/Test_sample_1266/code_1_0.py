    # Step 1: Define the components
    compound_1 = "(2E)-4-Hydroxy-2-nonen-8-ynal (HNY)"
    compound_2 = "4-Octyl Itaconate (4-OI)"
    cellular_target = "Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH)"
    cell_line = "Raw 264.7 macrophage cells"
    protein_1 = "Keap1"
    protein_2 = "JAK1"

    # Step 2: Determine the mechanism of action
    # Both HNY (a reactive aldehyde) and 4-OI are electrophilic molecules.
    # Electrophiles trigger a cellular stress response.
    # The primary sensor for this type of stress is the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.
    # Electrophiles modify cysteine residues on Keap1.
    print(f"Step 1: Both {compound_1} and {compound_2} are electrophiles that activate the Keap1-Nrf2 stress response pathway.")

    # Step 3: Predict the change in ALDH
    # Keap1 modification prevents it from targeting the transcription factor Nrf2 for degradation.
    # Nrf2 accumulates, translocates to the nucleus, and activates the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE).
    # ALDH genes are well-known targets of Nrf2 and contain AREs in their promoters.
    # Therefore, activating Nrf2 will increase the transcription and amount of ALDH protein.
    aldh_change = "increase"
    print(f"Step 2: Activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway leads to an {aldh_change} in the expression of target genes, including {cellular_target}.")

    # Step 4: Compare the potency of 4-OI and HNY
    # 4-Octyl Itaconate (4-OI) is a derivative of the endogenous metabolite itaconate and is specifically designed and known as a highly potent Nrf2 activator.
    # It is generally considered more potent than many other electrophiles, including 4-HNE and its derivatives, in activating this pathway.
    # Therefore, 50 uM 4-OI is expected to cause a more significant response than 50 uM HNY.
    comparison = "more"
    print(f"Step 3: At the same concentration, {compound_2} is known to be a very potent Nrf2 activator, likely inducing a {comparison} significant change in ALDH levels than {compound_1}.")

    # Step 5: Identify the key protein involved
    # Keap1 is the direct sensor of the electrophiles and the upstream regulator of Nrf2.
    # JAK1 is primarily involved in cytokine signaling pathways (JAK-STAT) and is not the direct sensor in this context.
    involved_protein = protein_1
    print(f"Step 4: The protein that directly senses these electrophiles and initiates this cascade is {involved_protein}.")

    # Step 6: Consolidate the final answer

    print(f"Treatment will cause an {aldh_change} in ALDH.")
    print(f"The change with 4-OI will be {comparison}.")
