    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), I will use a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the `fugashi` Python library, which is an interface to the MeCab morphological analyzer, along with the `unidic-lite` dictionary. This dictionary contains detailed linguistic information for Japanese words, including pitch accent.\n2.  The script will look up the word 「弟」.\n3.  The library returns the pitch accent pattern as a number. This number represents the mora (syllabic unit) after which the pitch falls. The standard interpretation of this number is:\n    *   `0`: Heiban (平板) - The pitch rises after the first mora and remains high.\n    *   `1`: Atamadaka (頭高) - The pitch is high only on the first mora and then falls.\n    *   `n > 1`: Nakadaka (中高) or Odaka (尾高) - The pitch falls after the 'n'-th mora. If `n` is equal to the number of morae in the word, it's Odaka; otherwise, it's Nakadaka.\n4.  The script will parse this information, determine the correct pitch accent name based on the number, and print the result.\n\nFor the script to run, you will need to install the required libraries:\n`pip install fugashi unidic-lite`\n\n```python\nimport fugashi\nimport sys\n\ndef get_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function looks up the pitch accent of a Japanese word using fugashi and unidic.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Initialize the tagger. The unidic dictionary is required for accent info.\n        tagger = fugashi.Tagger()\n    except RuntimeError:\n        print(\"Error: fugashi/MeCab could not be initialized.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        print(\"Please make sure you have installed fugashi and a dictionary:\", file=sys.stderr)\n        print(\"pip install fugashi unidic-lite\", file=sys.stderr)\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    # Process the word. We look at the first node as \"弟\" is a single word.\n    node = tagger.parse(word)[0]\n\n    # Extract relevant features from the dictionary entry.\n    reading = node.feature.kana\n    mora_count = len(reading)  # For オトート, length is 4, which is the mora count.\n    \n    # The accent type is provided as a string like \"0\", \"1\", etc.\n    accent_type_str = node.feature.accent_type\n\n    try:\n        accent_pattern_num = int(accent_type_str)\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        print(f\"Could not determine accent pattern number for '{word}'.\")\n        return\n\n    # Determine the pattern name based on the number and mora count.\n    if accent_pattern_num == 0:\n        accent_pattern_name = \"Heiban\"\n        pitch_description = \"L-H-H-H\" # (L)ow-(H)igh\n    elif accent_pattern_num == 1:\n        accent_pattern_name = \"Atamadaka\"\n        pitch_description = \"H-L-L-L\"\n    elif 1 < accent_pattern_num < morae_count:\n        accent_pattern_name = \"Nakadaka\"\n        pitch_description = \"L-H...H(fall)-L\"\n    elif accent_pattern_num == morae_count:\n        accent_pattern_name = \"Odaka\"\n        pitch_description = \"L-H-H-H(fall after word)\"\n    else:\n        accent_pattern_name = \"Unknown\"\n        pitch_description = \"N/A\"\n\n    print(f\"Analysis for: 「{word}」\")\n    print(f\"Reading (Kana): {reading}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Morae: {mora_count}\")\n    print(f\"Pitch Accent Number (from dictionary): {accent_pattern_num}\")\n    print(f\"Pitch Pattern Type: {accent_pattern_name}\")\n    print(f\"Pitch contour example for a {mora_count}-mora word of this type: {pitch_description}\")\n    \n# The word we want to analyze.\ntarget_word = \"弟\"\nget_pitch_accent(target_word)\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
