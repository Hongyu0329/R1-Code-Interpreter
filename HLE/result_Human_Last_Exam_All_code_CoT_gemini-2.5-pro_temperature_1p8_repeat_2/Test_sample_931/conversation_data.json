    "My plan to solve this is to first use my knowledge of entomology to determine the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies).\n\n1.  **Analyze Raphidiopteran Diet:** I know that Raphidioptera, in both their larval and adult stages, are primarily predators. Their main food source is other small, soft-bodied arthropods.\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** Aphids are a classic example of small, soft-bodied insects that adult snakeflies prey on. This choice is highly plausible.\n    *   **A. Nectar:** While primarily predatory, many predatory insects supplement their diet with sugars from sources like nectar for energy. This is also a plausible food source for adult snakeflies.\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Snakeflies are not herbivores; they do not eat leaf tissue. This is incorrect.\n    *   **C. Fungus:** They are not fungivores. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While they might consume some pollen along with nectar, it's generally considered a supplementary food source. However, given the options, let's focus on the most definitive answers.\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Both predation on aphids (E) and feeding on nectar (A) are documented behaviors for adult snakeflies. Therefore, the option that combines both A and E would be the most complete and correct answer.\n4.  **Select the Final Answer:** Option F states \"A and E\", which perfectly aligns with the known feeding habits.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that will print out this reasoning and state the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the feeding habits of adult Raphidiopterans\n    and provides the correct answer from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Stating the knowledge base for the answer\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidioptera (snakeflies).\")\n    print(\"Adult snakeflies are primarily predators, equipped with chewing mouthparts to consume prey.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the provided answer choices based on biological facts.\")\n    # Analysis of choice A\n    print(\"Choice A (Nectar): It is known that many predatory insects, including some snakeflies, supplement their diet with nectar for energy.
