    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to consider the additional symmetries imposed by the complex structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Start with the general case:** A generic Riemannian manifold of real dimension `n` has `n^2(n^2 - 1)/12` independent components in its Riemann tensor.\n2.  **Introduce the Kähler manifold:** A Kähler manifold has a complex structure, so its properties are better described using a complex dimension `m`, where the real dimension `n = 2m`. The complex structure introduces additional symmetries.\n3.  **Identify the key structure:** The Riemann tensor of a Kähler manifold can be shown to be equivalent to a Hermitian form on the vector space of symmetric holomorphic 2-tensors (tensors of type (2,0)).\n4.  **Calculate the dimension of the base space:** The complex vector space of symmetric (2,0)-tensors, let's call it `V`, has a dimension `d` given by `d = m(m+1)/2`.\n5.  **Calculate the number of components of the Hermitian form:** A Hermitian form on a complex vector space of dimension `d` is specified by `d^2` independent real numbers.\n6.  **Final Formula:** Combining these facts, the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is `(m(m+1)/2)^2`.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that takes the complex dimension `m` and calculates this number, showing the steps in the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_kahler_riemann_components(m_values):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    for a Kähler manifold of given complex dimensions.\n\n    Args:\n        m_values (list): A list of integer complex dimensions to calculate for.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold\")\n    print(\"of complex dimension 'm' is given by the formula: N = (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2.\\n\")\n\n    for m in m_values:\n        if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n            print(f\"Skipping invalid dimension: {m}.
