    consensus view ("C") or a debated statement ("D"), and prints the
    resulting string.

    1: The Morrison formation represents a foredeep deposit. -> C
    2: Metamorphic core complexes formed in response to a slab window. -> D
    3: An orogenic plateau ("Nevadaplano") existed in Nevada by end Cretaceous. -> C
    4: An "Arizonaplano" was constructed via magmatic thickening. -> D
    5: Laramide-style structures are generally inboard of Sevier-style structures. -> C
    6: The Sierra Nevada/Idaho Batholith were formed by the Cordilleran arc. -> C
    7: Ignimbrite eruptions propagated southwest from the Eocene. -> C
    8: The Colorado Plateau reached modern elevations by the late Cretaceous. -> D
    9: The Cascades arc reached modern elevation by the late Oligocene. -> D
    10: Laramide deformation was caused by subduction of the Shatsky conjugate. -> D
