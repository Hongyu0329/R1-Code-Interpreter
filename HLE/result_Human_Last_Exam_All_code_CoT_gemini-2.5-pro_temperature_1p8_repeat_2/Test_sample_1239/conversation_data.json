    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of space, time, and the fields (velocity $\\mathbf{u}$ and pressure $p$) that leave the form of the equations unchanged.\n\nThe main symmetries are:\n1.  **Time translations**: Shifting the origin of time. This is defined by one parameter.\n2.  **Spatial translations**: Shifting the origin of the coordinate system in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is defined by three parameters (one for each spatial dimension).\n3.  **Spatial rotations**: Rotating the coordinate system in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, has three parameters (e.g., Euler angles).\n4.  **Galilean boosts**: Transforming to a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity. This is defined by three parameters (the components of the velocity vector).\n\nThese symmetries together form the Galilean group. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters required to define a transformation.\n\nIt is important to note that the scaling transformations that are symmetries of the Euler equations (the inviscid case) are not symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations due to the presence of the constant viscosity term. Furthermore, there is an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries related to adding an arbitrary function of time to the pressure, but the question typically refers to the dimension of the finite, non-trivial part of the symmetry group.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the dimension by summing the parameters for each symmetry.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the 3D\n    incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The problem is set in 3-dimensional space.\n    num_dimensions = 3\n\n    # 1.
