# The problem is to find the 50th segmented number.
# A segmented number is a positive integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

# As derived in the thinking steps, the segmented numbers are the powers of 2.
# 1st segmented number = 1 = 2^0
# 2nd segmented number = 2 = 2^1
# 3rd segmented number = 4 = 2^2
# nth segmented number = 2^(n-1)

# We need to find the 50th element in this sequence.
n = 50
fifty_minus_one = n - 1
# The 50th segmented number is 2^(50-1) = 2^49.
result = 2**fifty_minus_one

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# We interpret this as showing the components of the calculation.
