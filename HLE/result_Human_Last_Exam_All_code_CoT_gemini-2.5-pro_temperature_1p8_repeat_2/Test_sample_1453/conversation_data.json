    "My plan is to determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil sequence by analyzing its amino acid pattern. Here are the steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-amino-acid pattern called a heptad repeat, commonly denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, dictating how the helices pack together. I will examine the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` to find this repeating pattern. A strong clue is the regular spacing of hydrophobic residues.\n2.  **Extract Core Residues:** Once the phasing of the heptad repeat is established, I will identify all the amino acids that fall into the crucial 'a' and 'd' positions.\n3.  **Apply Knobs-into-Holes Principles:** The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, etc.) is heavily influenced by the size, shape, and chemical properties of the 'a' and 'd' position residues. I will apply the following standard rules:\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Generally accommodates a wide range of hydrophobic residues at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Strongly prefers beta-branched amino acids (Isoleucine, Valine) at the 'a' position and non-beta-branched ones (Leucine) at the 'd' position. It is sterically intolerant of very bulky residues (like Tryptophan) at the 'a' position, as three such side chains would clash in the center of the bundle.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Often has a hydrophobic residue (like Leucine) at the 'd' position but requires a polar or charged residue at the 'a' position.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** By comparing the sequence's specific 'a' and 'd' residues against these packing rules, I will determine the most likely oligomeric state.\n\nThe Python script below will automate this logical analysis, print the steps, and provide the final predicted number.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state\n    based on the residues at the 'a' and 'd' heptad positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define amino acid properties for the analysis\n    amino_acid_properties = {\n        'W': {'size': 'very bulky', 'type': 'hydrophobic'},\n        'A': {'size': 'small', 'type': 'hydrophobic'},\n        'L': {'size': 'medium', 'type': 'hydrophobic'},\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Determine heptad repeat phasing\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Determine Heptad Repeat Phasing ---\")\n    print(\"The sequence shows a Leucine (L) at positions 7, 14, 21, and 28.\")\n    print(\"This regular 7-residue spacing is the hallmark of a core 'd' position in a heptad repeat (abcdefg).\")\n    print(\"This establishes the phasing as 'efgabcd', meaning the sequence starts at the 'e' position.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Extract core 'a' and 'd' residues\n    a_positions = []\n    d_positions = []\n    # With 'efgabcd' phasing, 'a' is at index 3 and 'd' is at index 6 (0-indexed) of each repeat.\n    for i, residue in enumerate(sequence):\n        heptad_pos_index = i % 7\n        if heptad_pos_index == 3:  # Position 'a'\n            a_positions.append(residue)\n        elif heptad_pos_index == 6:  # Position 'd'\n            d_positions.append(residue)\n\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Identify Core Residues ---\")\n    print(f\"The core 'a' position residues are: {', '.join(a_positions)}\")\n    print(f\"The core 'd' position residues are: {', '.join(d_positions)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Apply packing rules\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Apply 'Knobs-into-Holes' Packing Rules ---\")\n    print(\"  - Dimer (2): Favors hydrophobic 'a' and 'd' positions.
