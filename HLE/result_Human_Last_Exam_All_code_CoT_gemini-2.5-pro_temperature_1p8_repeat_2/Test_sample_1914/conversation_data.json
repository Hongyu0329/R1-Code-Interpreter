    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we will systematically analyze the possible structures.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  A category with 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have two identity morphisms, `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. Since the category has a total of 4 morphisms, this leaves 2 non-identity morphisms, which we can call `f` and `g`.\n2.  We will classify the possible category structures based on how `f` and `g` connect the objects `A` and `B`. This is determined by their domains and codomains.\n3.  For each classification, we will determine the number of distinct, non-isomorphic categories that satisfy the category axioms (closure under composition, associativity, and identity laws).\n4.  The total number of categories will be the sum of the counts from all the distinct classifications.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan by calculating the number of categories for each case and summing them up. The comments in the code provide the reasoning for the numbers derived in each step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of non-isomorphic categories\n    with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation for the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms:\\n\")\n    \n    # A category with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 morphisms must have two identity morphisms (id_A, id_B).\n    # This leaves 2 other morphisms, f and g.
