    explanation = """
    1.  Context: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat sequence. This repeat is unstable in somatic cells and tends to get longer over time, a phenomenon known as somatic instability, which worsens the disease.

    2.  The Role of DNA Repair: Research has shown that DNA repair pathways are involved in the mechanism of this CTG repeat expansion. When DNA damage (like an oxidized base) occurs within the repeat tract, repair machinery is recruited.

    3.  The Role of LIG1: DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) is a critical enzyme that seals nicks in DNA during replication and repair. It is essential for completing a specific 'long-patch' DNA repair pathway that acts on the damaged CTG repeats.

    4.  The Pathogenic Mechanism: This LIG1-dependent repair process, when operating on the structured CTG repeats, is error-prone and often results in the addition of more CTG units, causing expansions. Thus, LIG1 is a key factor that promotes instability and expansion.

    5.  Impact of Knockout: Consequently, if LIG1 is knocked out or its levels are significantly reduced, this expansion-prone repair pathway is blocked. The final step of sealing the DNA cannot occur, which prevents the addition of new repeats.

    6.  Conclusion: The knockout of LIG1 leads to a significant decrease in the rate of CTG repeat expansions, which means there is reduced somatic instability.
