# This script represents the final derived expression for the photon production rate.
# The calculation based on Fermi's Golden Rule shows that the rate, when expressed
# as an energy (hbar * Gamma), matches one of the provided options.

# The final expression is a fraction. Let's define its components.

# Numerator components
numerator_coefficient = 8
numerator_term1 = "pi"
numerator_term2 = "g^2"

# Denominator components
denominator_term1 = "h"
denominator_term2 = "gamma_c"

print("The photon production rate (expressed as an energy: hbar * Gamma) is given by the following equation:")
print(f"Final equation: ({numerator_coefficient} * {numerator_term1} * {numerator_term2}) / ({denominator_term1} * {denominator_term2})")
print(f"\nThis corresponds to the expression: 8 * pi * g^2 / (h * gamma_c)")
