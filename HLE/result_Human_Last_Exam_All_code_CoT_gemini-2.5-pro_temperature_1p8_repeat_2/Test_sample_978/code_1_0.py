    # Vicarious Liability: An employer is liable for the negligent acts of an employee

    # Negligence: A failure to take proper care, resulting in damage or injury to another.
    # Joint and Several Liability: A wronged party can sue any or all responsible parties
    #                            for the full amount of the damages.
