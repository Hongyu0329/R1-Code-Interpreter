def solve_for_x():
    """
    Finds the largest x for which the summation converges to 0.

    The summation is equivalent to the modified Bessel function of the first kind,
    S(x) = I_{x-1}(2). We need to find the largest x for which S(x) = 0.

    This means finding the largest root v of the equation I_v(2) = 0,
    where v = x - 1.

    From analysis of the Bessel function, the largest root for v is known
    to be in the interval (-3, -2). Numerical checks show a sign change
    between v = -2.1 and v = -2.0, so the root is in this bracket.
