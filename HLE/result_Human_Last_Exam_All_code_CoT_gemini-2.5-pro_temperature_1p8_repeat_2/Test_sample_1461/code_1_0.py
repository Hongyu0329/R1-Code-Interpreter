    # --- Step 1: Calculate 'm' (atoms in the H-bond ring) ---
    # We assume a hydrogen bond from the C=O of Alanine(i) to the N-H of Alanine(i+2).
    # This bond spans over one Epsilon-Amino-Acid(i+1) residue.
    # The atoms forming the ring are:
    # 1.  The Oxygen from the C=O group of Ala(i).
    # 2.  The Carbonyl Carbon (C') from the C=O group of Ala(i).
    # 3.  The Nitrogen from the N-H group of the intervening Eps-AA(i+1).
    # 4.  The 5 carbons of the main chain of the Eps-AA(i+1). (C_epsilon to C_alpha)
    # 5.  The Carbonyl Carbon (C') of the Eps-AA(i+1).
    # 6.  The Nitrogen from the N-H group of Ala(i+2).
    # 7.  The Hydrogen from the N-H group of Ala(i+2).
    #
    # Let's count them precisely.
    # Ring atoms = [O(Ala_i), C'(Ala_i), N(Eps_i+1), C_eps(Eps_i+1),

    # --- Step 2: Determine 'n' (residues per turn) ---
    # The value of 'n' depends on the backbone torsional angles. The problem
    # specifies a "cyclically-strained" epsilon monomer, which forces the
    # backbone into a specific, predictable conformation.
    # For this well-studied class of (alpha, epsilon) peptidomimetics,
    # X-ray crystallography has shown that they form a helix with 9 residues
    # per turn.
