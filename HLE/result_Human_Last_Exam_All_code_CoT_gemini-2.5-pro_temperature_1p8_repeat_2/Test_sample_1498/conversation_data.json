    "My plan is to identify the exact verses (bayt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that enumerate the names of the 25 prophets. I will then create a Python script to display these specific verses along with their corresponding numbers. The script will:\n1.  Store the Arabic text of the relevant verses in a list.\n2.  Iterate through the list.\n3.  Print each verse number followed by the verse itself, to clearly show the range from start to finish.\n\nThis will directly answer the user's question by programmatically displaying the requested section of the poem.\n\n```python\ndef display_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the verses from 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The names of the Prophets in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from Bayt 35 to 39.\\n\")\n    print(\"Here are the verses:\\n\")\n\n    verses = {\n        35: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ ادْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ... صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n        36: \"لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ... يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n        37: \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ... ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n        38: \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\",\n        39: \"عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلاَةُ وَالسَّلاَمُ ... وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الأَيَّامُ\"\n    }\n\n    for number, text in verses.items():\n        print(f\"Bayt {number}: {text}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_prophets_verses()\n```\n<<<35 to 39>>>"
