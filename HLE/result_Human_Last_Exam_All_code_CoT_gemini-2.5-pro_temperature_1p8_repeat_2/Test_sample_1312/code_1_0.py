    # Explanation of the core problem
    print("The Problem: Limited recombination (e.g., in asexual organisms) can lead to the irreversible accumulation of harmful mutations, a process known as Muller's Ratchet. We are looking for a feature of the genome's structure that can counteract this effect.\n")

    # Step-by-step analysis of each option
    print("Analysis of Options:")
    print("--------------------")
    
    # A. Tandem repeats
    print("A. Tandem repeats: These are sequences repeated back-to-back. They have high mutation rates but are not considered a primary mechanism for purging harmful mutations across the genome.")

    # B. Chromosomal inversions
    print("B. Chromosomal inversions: These are chromosome rearrangements. They actually *suppress* recombination in individuals heterozygous for the inversion. Thus, they contribute to the problem rather than solving it.")

    # C. Transposable elements
    print("C. Transposable elements: While they can create genetic novelty by moving around the genome, their effects are often damaging. Their role as a consistent, beneficial compensatory mechanism is highly debated.")

    # E. Polyploidy
    print("E. Polyploidy: This is the state of having multiple sets of chromosomes. It provides redundancy, as a harmful mutation in one gene copy can be masked by functional copies on other chromosomes. This slows deterioration but doesn't actively 'fix' or remove the bad mutation.")

    # D. Multigene families
    print("D. Multigene families: This refers to having multiple copies of similar genes grouped together. This feature offers a powerful two-part solution:")
    print("   1. Redundancy: Similar to polyploidy, multiple copies buffer the organism from the harmful effects of a mutation in any single copy.")
    print("   2. Active Correction: A non-reciprocal recombination process called 'gene conversion' can occur between members of a multigene family. This allows a mutated gene copy to be 'repaired' using a non-mutated copy as a template, effectively purging the harmful mutation from the population. This directly counters Muller's Ratchet.")
    print("--------------------\n")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("Conclusion: Multigene families provide both redundancy and a mechanism for active removal of deleterious mutations (gene conversion). This makes them the most direct and effective compensatory mechanism among the choices.")
    print("\nThe correct choice is D.")
