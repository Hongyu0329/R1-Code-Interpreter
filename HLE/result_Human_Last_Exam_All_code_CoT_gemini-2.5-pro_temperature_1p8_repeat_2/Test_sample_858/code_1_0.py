    Calculates the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points in an aposyndetic continuum.

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    1. Let X be an aposyndetic continuum.
    2. We show that every point p in X is a non-block point. This means the set of non-block points is X itself.
       - Proof: For any p in X, consider S = X \\ {p}. For any x, y in S, since X is aposyndetic, there's a continuum K_x containing x but not p, and a continuum K_y containing y but not p. The union K_x U K_y is a continuum in S containing both x and y. Thus, S is continuum-connected. S is also dense in itself. Therefore, p is a non-block point. This holds for all p in X.
    3. The problem reduces to finding the minimum cardinality of an aposyndetic continuum.
    4. A continuum must be non-empty, so its cardinality must be at least 1.
    5. Consider the simplest continuum: a single-point space, X = {p}.
    6. This space is a continuum (compact, connected, Hausdorff).
    7. It is also aposyndetic, as the condition is "for every two distinct points...", which is vacuously true.
    8. The cardinality of this space is 1.
    9. Since a smaller cardinality is not possible for a continuum, 1 is the minimum.
