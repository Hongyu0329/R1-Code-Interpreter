    "The reaction described is an E2 elimination. To determine the product, we must analyze the stereochemistry of the reactants and the requirements of the E2 mechanism.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Substrate:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S, 2R) stereochemistry indicates that the bromine atom at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are *trans* to each other.\n2.  **Identify the Reagent:** The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This reagent strongly favors E2 elimination over substitution reactions.\n3.  **Analyze the E2 Mechanism Requirements:** The E2 elimination reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, Br) and the hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a beta-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must both be in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring (trans-diaxial).\n4.  **Consider the Chair Conformations:**\n    *   Cyclohexane rings exist in chair conformations. We need to look at the conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. Since the Br and methyl groups are *trans*, they can be either both equatorial (diequatorial) or both axial (diaxial).\n    *   **Conformer A (diequatorial):** The bulky methyl group is equatorial, and the bromine is also equatorial. This is the more stable chair conformation. However, in this conformation, the equatorial bromine is not anti-periplanar to any beta-hydrogens. Therefore, **E2 elimination cannot occur from this stable conformer.**\n    *   **Conformer B (diaxial):** Through a ring flip, the molecule can adopt a less stable conformation where the methyl group is axial and the bromine is axial. Although this conformer is higher in energy and less populated, it is the only one from which E2 elimination can proceed because the bromine is in the required axial position.\n5.  **Identify the Product:**\n    *   With the bromine atom locked in an axial position (in Conformer B), we must look for an anti-periplanar beta-hydrogen. The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 (the Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene) **is impossible**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is perfectly anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n    *   The base (tert-butoxide) will abstract this axial hydrogen from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group at C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The final product is therefore **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThe reaction is under stereoelectronic control, meaning the geometry of the reactant dictates which product can form. Only the Hofmann-like product (less substituted alkene) can be formed due to the anti-periplanar requirement.\n\n```python\n# The reaction is a stereospecific E2 elimination.\n# Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The trans configuration forces a diaxial conformation for the E2 reaction.\n# In the reactive diaxial conformer, Br is axial at C1 and the methyl group is axial at C2.\n# The E2 mechanism requires an anti-periplanar beta-hydrogen.\n# - The hydrogen at C2 is equatorial, so no elimination can occur towards C2 to form 1-methylcyclohexene.\n# - The hydrogen at C6 is axial, allowing it to be removed.\n# Elimination of the axial H at C6 and axial Br at C1 forms a double bond between C1 and C6.\n# The resulting product name is determined by this connectivity.\n\nproduct_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\nprint(product_name)\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
