# The reaction is a stereospecific E2 elimination.
# Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The trans configuration forces a diaxial conformation for the E2 reaction.
# In the reactive diaxial conformer, Br is axial at C1 and the methyl group is axial at C2.
# The E2 mechanism requires an anti-periplanar beta-hydrogen.
# - The hydrogen at C2 is equatorial, so no elimination can occur towards C2 to form 1-methylcyclohexene.
# - The hydrogen at C6 is axial, allowing it to be removed.
# Elimination of the axial H at C6 and axial Br at C1 forms a double bond between C1 and C6.
# The resulting product name is determined by this connectivity.
