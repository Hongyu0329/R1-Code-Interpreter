    # Key Legal Principle: Under the Sale of Goods Act, risk of loss generally
    # follows property/ownership. However, the primary factor is the intention
    # of the parties.

    # 1. Identify the contract type and conditions.
    # The goods (MacBook Pro) were specific but not in a "deliverable state"
    # initially because they required repairs.

    # 2. Analyze the parties' intentions.
    # Jake and Luke agreed on a specific date and time for pickup (afternoon of June 6).
    # This arrangement shows a clear intention that the final transfer of possession,
    # property, and risk would occur at that specific time.

    # 3. Determine the moment of loss.
    # The laptop was destroyed by flooding overnight before the agreed-upon pickup time on June 6.

    # 4. Conclusion on Risk of Loss.
    # Because the loss occurred while the goods were still in Jake's possession and
    # before the contractually implied moment of transfer (pickup by Luke), the risk
    # had not yet passed to Luke. Jake, the seller, still bore the risk.

    # 5. Select the best answer.
    # Answer D accurately reflects this conclusion: risk would not pass until Luke
    # took possession, meaning Jake must return the money.

    The core issue is determining when the risk of loss transferred from Jake (seller) to Luke (buyer). While the default rules of the Sale of Goods Act are complex, they can be overridden by the clear intention of the parties.

    1. Intention of the Parties: Jake and Luke agreed that Luke would pick up the repaired laptop on the afternoon of June 6. This creates a strong inference that they intended for the final transfer of the laptop (including property and risk) to happen at the moment of pickup.

    2. Timing of Loss: The laptop was destroyed by a flood before the agreed-upon pickup time.

    3. Conclusion: Since the loss occurred before the transaction was intended to be completed by the transfer of possession to Luke, the risk remained with Jake. Therefore, Jake is obligated to return the $1,000 he received from Luke.

    Answer choice D best explains this outcome.
