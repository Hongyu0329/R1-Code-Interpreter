    This function explains the reasoning to determine the value of n

    print("Step 1: Understand the question")
    print("The question asks for a number n such that any tame functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable.")
    print("J is an upper semilattice. This means for any two elements x, y in J, their join (least upper bound) x V y exists.")
    print("The term 'tame functor' suggests we are in the context of representation theory of finite posets.\n")

    print("Step 2: Relate n-resolvability to global dimension")
    print("An object is n-resolvable if its projective dimension is at most n.")
    print("To find an n that works for all such functors, we find the global dimension of the functor category Fun(J, Vect_K).")
    print("The projective dimension of any functor is bounded by the global dimension of the category.\n")

    print("Step 3: Use the criterion for global dimension <= 1")
    print("For a finite poset J, the global dimension of Fun(J, Vect_K) is <= 1 if and only if:")
    print("For any two incomparable elements x, y in J, the set of their common lower bounds L(x, y) = {z | z < x and z < y} is either empty or has a maximum element.\n")

    print("Step 4: Prove that a finite upper semilattice J satisfies the criterion")
    print("Let x and y be two incomparable elements in J.")
    print("Let L(x, y) be the set of their common lower bounds. If L(x, y) is empty, the criterion holds.")
    print("If L(x, y) is not empty, since J is a finite upper semilattice, the join m = Vee_{s in L(x, y)} s exists.")
    print("We show m is the maximum element of L(x, y):")
    print(" - For any s in L(x, y), s < x. So x is an upper bound of L(x, y). Since m is the least upper bound, m <= x.")
    print(" - Similarly, for any s in L(x, y), s < y. So y is an upper bound of L(x, y), which means m <= y.")
    print(" - If m = x, then x <= y. This contradicts that x and y are incomparable. So, m < x.")
    print(" - Similarly, m < y.")
    print(" - Since m < x and m < y, m is in L(x, y).")
    print(" - By definition, m is an upper bound for all elements in L(x, y).")
    print(" - Therefore, m is the maximum element of L(x, y).\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclude the value of n")
    print("The criterion holds, so the global dimension of Fun(J, Vect_K) is at most 1.")
    print("This means every functor F has a projective dimension of at most 1.")
    print("A functor with projective dimension at most 1 is, by definition, 1-resolvable.")
    print("This applies to all functors, including all tame functors.\n")

    print(f"The equation is n = {n}.")
    print("Therefore, any such tame functor is n-resolvable for n = 1.")
