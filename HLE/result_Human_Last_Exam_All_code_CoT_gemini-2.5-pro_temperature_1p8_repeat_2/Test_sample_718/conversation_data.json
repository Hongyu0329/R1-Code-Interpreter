    "An $n$-resolvable module (or in this case, a functor) is one that has a projective resolution of length $n$. The question asks for a value of $n$ such that *any* tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable, where $J$ is an upper semilattice. This is a question about the global dimension of the category of functors on $J$.\n\nHere is my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Interpret the context:** The term \"tame functor\" comes from the representation theory of algebras and posets. This theory, particularly the classification into finite, tame, and wild representation types, is typically applied to finite-dimensional algebras, which in this context corresponds to $J$ being a **finite** poset. So, I will assume $J$ is a finite upper semilattice.\n\n2.  **Relate \"resolvability\" to \"global dimension\":** An object is $n$-resolvable if its projective dimension is at most $n$. To find an $n$ that works for *all* tame functors, we can find an upper bound for the projective dimension of *any* functor in the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. This upper bound is the global dimension of the category.\n\n3.  **Find the global dimension:** I need to find the global dimension of the category of representations of a finite upper semilattice $J$. There's a known criterion for a finite poset's representation category to have a global dimension of at most 1:\n    *   **Criterion:** The category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ has global dimension $\\leq 1$ if and only if for any two incomparable elements $x, y \\in J$, the set of their common lower bounds, $L(x, y) = \\{z \\in J \\mid z < x \\text{ and } z < y\\}$, either is empty or has a maximum element.\n\n4.  **Verify the criterion for an upper semilattice:** I will now show that any finite upper semilattice $J$ satisfies this criterion.\n    *   Let $x, y$ be any two incomparable elements in $J$.\n    *   Consider the set of their common lower bounds, $L(x, y)$. If this set is empty, the condition holds.\n    *   If $L(x, y)$ is not empty, since $J$ is a finite poset, the set $L(x, y)$ is also finite and non-empty. Because $J$ is an upper semilattice, any finite non-empty subset has a least upper bound (a join). Let $m = \\bigvee L(x, y)$ be the join of all elements in $L(x, y)$.\n    *   We need to show that $m$ is the maximum element of $L(x, y)$.\n        *   First, we show $m \\in L(x, y)$.\n        *   Every element $s \\in L(x, y)$ satisfies $s < x$. This means $x$ is an upper bound for the set $L(x, y)$. Since $m$ is the *least* upper bound, we must have $m \\le x$. Similarly, since every $s \\in L(x, y)$ satisfies $s < y$, $y$ is also an upper bound for $L(x, y)$, which implies $m \\le y$.\n        *   Can $m = x$? If $m=x$, then since we already know $m \\le y$, it would imply $x \\le y$. This contradicts our assumption that $x$ and $y$ are incomparable. Therefore, $m \\neq x$.\n        *   Combining $m \\le x$ and $m \\neq x$ gives $m < x$.\n        *   A symmetric argument shows that $m < y$.\n        *   Since $m < x$ and $m < y$, $m$ belongs to the set $L(x, y)$.\n        *   By definition, $m$ is the join of all elements in $L(x, y)$, so it is greater than or equal to every element in $L(x, y)$. This makes it the maximum element of $L(x, y)$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The criterion holds. Therefore, the global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ for a finite upper semilattice $J$ is at most 1. This means any functor $F: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ (whether it's tame, wild, or of finite type) has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n\n6.  **Final Answer:** A functor with a projective dimension of at most 1 has a projective resolution of length at most 1 (i.e., a resolution of the form $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to F \\to 0$). This means every functor is 1-resolvable. The information that the functor is \"tame\" is not needed to establish this upper bound.\n\n```python\ndef solve_functor_resolvability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to determine the value of n\n    for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the question\")\n    print(\"The question asks for a number n such that any tame functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable.\")\n    print(\"J is an upper semilattice.
