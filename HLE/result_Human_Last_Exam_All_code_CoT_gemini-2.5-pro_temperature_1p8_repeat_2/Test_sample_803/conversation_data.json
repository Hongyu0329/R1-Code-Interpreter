    "This is a problem in the field of group theory. To solve it, we need to understand the definitions of product-free sets and filled groups, and then apply relevant classification theorems from the research literature.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the group structure**: First, we'll use Sylow's theorems to determine the general structure of a nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime. This will show that `G` must be a semidirect product `Q rtimes Z_2`, where `Q` is the Sylow `q`-subgroup of order `q^m` and `Z_2` is the Sylow 2-subgroup.\n2.  **Apply classification theorems**: The concept of a \"filled group\" is a research topic. We will rely on key results from papers by G. G. Amiryan and A. S. Mamontov, who have specifically studied this class of groups. Their results provide a complete answer:\n    *   A semidirect product `Q rtimes Z_2` is not filled if the Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` is nonabelian.\n    *   If `Q` (let's call it `A`) is abelian, the group `A rtimes Z_2` is filled if and only if the automorphism induced by the `Z_2` part is \"fixed-point-free.\"\n3.  **Characterize the automorphism**: We will show that for an abelian group `A` of odd order, the only fixed-point-free automorphism of order 2 is the inversion map, `a -> a⁻¹`.\n4.  **Describe the groups**: This leads to the final classification. The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(A)`, where `A` is any abelian group of order `q^m`.\n5.  **Develop Python code**: I will write a Python script that takes `q` and `m` as input. The script will identify all possible abelian groups `A` of order `q^m` (based on integer partitions of `m`) and, for each, print a detailed description and group presentation of the corresponding filled group `Dih(A)`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n\ndef get_integer_partitions(n):\n    \"\"\"Generates all unique integer partitions of n.\"\"\"\n    memo = {}\n    def find_partitions(k):\n        if k in memo:\n            return memo[k]\n        if k == 0:\n            return [[]]\n        if k < 0:\n            return []\n        \n        result_set = set()\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            for sub_partition in find_partitions(k - i):\n                new_partition = tuple(sorted([i] + sub_partition))\n                result_set.add(new_partition)\n        \n        # Sort for canonical representation\n        result_list = sorted([list(p) for p in result_set])\n        memo[k] = result_list\n        return result_list\n        \n    return find_partitions(n)\n\n\ndef describe_filled_groups(q, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Describes the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m.\n    \n    Args:\n        q (int): An odd prime number.\n        m (int): A natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
