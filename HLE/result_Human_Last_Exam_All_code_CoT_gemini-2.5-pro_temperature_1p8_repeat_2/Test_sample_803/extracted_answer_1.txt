The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(A)`, which are the semidirect products `A \rtimes Z_2` where `A` is any abelian group of order `q^m` and the non-trivial element of `Z_2` acts on `A` via the inversion automorphism (`a \mapsto a^{-1}`).
