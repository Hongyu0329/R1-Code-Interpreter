    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two systems are combined, the Chern number of the resulting system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components, assuming the combination does not close the bulk energy gap. In this case, two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 are connected with a negligible tunneling barrier, effectively forming a single, larger system. Therefore, the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nI will write a Python script to calculate this sum and display the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two insulators\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the final equation showing the calculation\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction (C_total) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers (C1 and C2).\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
