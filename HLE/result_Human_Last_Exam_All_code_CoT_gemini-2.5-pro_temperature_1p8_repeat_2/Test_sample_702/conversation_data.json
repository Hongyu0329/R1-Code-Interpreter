    "To determine the connectivity of the map `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`, we can analyze its homotopy fiber. The connectivity of a map is an integer `k` such that the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups `π_i` for `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of the map being `(k-1)`-connected.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Generalize the Problem:** We consider the general map `f: Σ(ΩS^m ∧ ΩS^n) → Ω(S^m ∧ S^n)`. The specific problem is the case where `m=4` and `n=6`.\n2.  **Identify the Homotopy Fiber:** A known result in algebraic topology (from the work of F. Cohen and others on loop spaces) gives a homotopy fibration sequence involving this map:\n    `Σ²(ΩS^m ∧ ΩS^n) → Σ(ΩS^m ∧ ΩS^n) → Ω(S^m ∧ S^n)`\n    This means the homotopy fiber `F_f` of our map `f` is homotopy equivalent to `Σ²(ΩS^m ∧ ΩS^n)`.\n3.  **Calculate the Connectivity of the Fiber:** We calculate the connectivity of `F_f` by breaking it down into its components:\n    *   A sphere `S^k` is `(k-1)`-connected.\n    *   The loop space operation `Ω` decreases connectivity by 1. Thus, `ΩS^k` is `(k-2)`-connected.\n    *   The smash product of a `p`-connected space and a `q`-connected space is `(p+q+1)`-connected.\n    *   The suspension operation `Σ` increases connectivity by 1. A double suspension `Σ²` increases it by 2.\n    \n    Applying these rules:\n    *   `ΩS^m` is `(m-2)`-connected.\n    *   `ΩS^n` is `(n-2)`-connected.\n    *   The smash product `ΩS^m ∧ ΩS^n` is `(m-2) + (n-2) + 1 = (m+n-3)`-connected.\n    *   The fiber `F_f`, being the double suspension `Σ²(ΩS^m ∧ ΩS^n)`, is `(m+n-3) + 2 = (m+n-1)`-connected.\n4.  **Determine the Map's Connectivity:** Since the fiber `F_f` is `(m+n-1)`-connected, the map `f` itself is `k`-connected where `k-1 = m+n-1`. This yields `k = m+n`.\n5.  **Solve for the Specific Case:** We substitute `m=4` and `n=6` into our derived formula `k = m+n` to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Σ(ΩS^m ∧ ΩS^n) -> Ω(S^m ∧ S^n)\n    for m=4 and n=6.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The problem specifies the spaces S^4 and S^6.\n    m = 4\n    n = 6\n    \n    # Step 1: Connectivity of the loop spaces.\n    # The connectivity of ΩS^k is k-2.\n    conn_omega_sm = m - 2\n    conn_omega_sn = n - 2\n    \n    # Step 2: Connectivity of the smash product.\n    # The connectivity of X ∧ Y is conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1.\n    conn_smash = conn_omega_sm + conn_omega_sn + 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Connectivity of the fiber of the map.\n    # The fiber is equivalent to Σ²(ΩS^m ∧ ΩS^n).\n    # Double suspension increases connectivity by 2.\n    conn_fiber = conn_smash + 2\n    \n    # Step 4: Connectivity of the map.\n    # The connectivity of a map is one greater than the connectivity of its fiber.\n    connectivity_map = conn_fiber + 1\n\n    # Alternatively, using the derived formula: k = m + n\n    result = m + n\n\n    print(\"The connectivity 'k' is determined by the formula: k = m + n\")\n    print(\"For the given map, m=4 and n=6.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {m} + {n} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_connectivity()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
