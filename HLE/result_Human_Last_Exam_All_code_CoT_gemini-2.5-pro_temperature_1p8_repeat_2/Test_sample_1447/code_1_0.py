def solve_translation_puzzle():
    """
    Analyzes translation practices for stories with language-specific puns.

    The core challenge in both "The Next Day" and "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter"
    is the use of homophones (words that sound alike) that are crucial to the plot.
    This kind of wordplay is specific to the original language (English).

    Let's evaluate the options:
    I. Transcreation: This involves finding an analogous pun in the target language and
       adapting the story. This preserves the mystery's mechanism. It is a valid solution.
    II. Embedded links to audio: This explains the original pun but breaks the narrative
        immersion and doesn't truly translate the effect. It is not an effective solution.
    III. Changing the setting: This alone does not solve the language-specific problem.
         It is not a solution.
    IV. Character as a foreigner: This provides a plausible in-story reason for
        phonetic confusion, making the original wordplay (or a variation) understandable
        in the context of the translation. It is a valid solution.
    V. Pictorial illustration: A picture cannot represent a pun, which is based on sound.
       It is not a solution.
    VI. Footnotes: This explains the puzzle rather than letting the reader experience it,
        destroying the narrative effect. It is not an effective solution.

    The practices capable of overcoming the challenge are I and IV.
    The final answer should be expressed as Roman numerals in ascending order,
    separated by a hyphen.
