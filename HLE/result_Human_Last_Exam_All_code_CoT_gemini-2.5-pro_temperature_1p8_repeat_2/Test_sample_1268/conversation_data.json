    "Of course, I can help with that. This question touches upon the geometry of numbers applied to algebraic number theory. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Terminology**: The question uses specific terminology. I will first interpret the terms in the context of number theory.\n    *   **Squarefree natural numbers (N)**: This suggests we are working with quadratic number fields, specifically real quadratic fields of the form $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n    *   **Covolume (V)**: This is the volume of the fundamental domain of the lattice formed by the ring of integers of $K$ when embedded in Euclidean space. For a real quadratic field, $V = \\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field.\n    *   **Maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)**: This non-standard notation is best interpreted as the $L_\\infty$-norm of the shortest vector in the lattice. This corresponds to $\\min_{\\alpha \\in O_K\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\max(|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)|, |\\sigma_2(\\alpha)|)$, where $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ are the two embeddings of the real quadratic field into $\\mathbb{R}$. This quantity represents the smallest possible value for the maximum size of a non-zero algebraic integer and its conjugate.\n\n2.  **Apply Minkowski's Theorem**: The relationship between the covolume of a lattice and the size of its shortest vector is given by Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies. By applying this theorem to the lattice of integers of a number field, we can find an upper bound for the \"maximum norm\" as interpreted above.\n\n3.  **Derive the Bound**: For a general number field of degree $n$ with $r_1$ real and $2r_2$ complex embeddings, the upper bound is $\\frac{2}{\\pi^{r_2/n}} V^{1/n}$. For a real quadratic field like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, we have $n=2$, $r_1=2$, and $r_2=0$. Substituting these values into the general formula simplifies the expression significantly.\n\n4.  **Create the Script**: I will provide a Python script that takes a squarefree natural number `N` as input. The script will:\n    a. Determine the discriminant $\\Delta_K$ of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n    b. Calculate the covolume $V = \\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$.\n    c. Apply the derived formula to compute the numerical value of the upper bound.\n    d. Print the final relationship and the calculated values, including the numbers in the final equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_discriminant(d):\n    \"\"\"Computes the discriminant of the quadratic field Q(sqrt(d)).\"\"\"\n    if d % 4 == 1:\n        return d\n    else:\n        return 4 * d\n\ndef is_squarefree(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a positive integer n is squarefree.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    i = 2\n    # No prime factor is repeated.\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % (i * i) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 1\n    return True\n\ndef calculate_max_norm_bound(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the upper bound for the minimum max-norm for the\n    real quadratic field Q(sqrt(N)).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analysis for the real quadratic field K = Q(sqrt({N})) ---\")\n    if not isinstance(N, int) or N <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: Input must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n    if N == 1:\n        print(\"Error: N=1 corresponds to Q, not a quadratic field.\")\n        return\n    if not is_squarefree(N):\n        print(f\"Warning: {N} is not a squarefree number.
