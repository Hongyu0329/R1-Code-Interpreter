    "My plan is to analyze each classical ballet step provided in the answer choices to determine its starting and ending leg positions. I will codify this analysis in a Python script.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of my logic:\n1.  I will create a data structure (a dictionary) to hold information about each ballet step.\n2.  For each step, I will store its name and a brief analysis of its movement, specifically focusing on whether the leg position changes from start to finish.\n3.  **Entrechat six:** This is a step of battery (beaten steps) from a vertical jump. Even-numbered entrechats (deux, quatre, six) are defined by starting and ending in the same fifth position. This is a very strong candidate.\n4.  **Échappé battu changé:** The French term 'changé' literally means 'changed'. This step explicitly ends with the feet in the opposite position (e.g., if the right foot started in front, it ends in the back).\n5.  **Assemblé:** This means 'to assemble'. While there are simple forms where the feet do not change, the most common forms taught and performed are 'assemblé dessus' and 'dessous', both of which change which foot is in front. Therefore, it's not a reliable answer.\n6.  **Glissade derrière:** This means 'to glide behind'. It is a traveling step that, by this definition, changes the feet. The foot that starts in front will close behind the other foot, making the other foot the new front foot.\n7.  **Gargouillade:** This is an embellished 'pas de chat'. A standard 'pas de chat' does start and end in the same fifth position. However, gargouillade is a more complex, decorative step. Compared to 'entrechat six', whose very definition is tied to its specific number of beats and a clean return to the starting position, gargouillade is defined by its flourishing leg movements (ronds de jambe). The return to the start is a feature, but less definitional than for an entrechat. Therefore, 'Entrechat six' is the best and most precise answer.\n8.  The Python script will iterate through this analysis and programmatically identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'position_changes': False,\n            'reason': 'This is a vertical jump with three beats (six crossings).
