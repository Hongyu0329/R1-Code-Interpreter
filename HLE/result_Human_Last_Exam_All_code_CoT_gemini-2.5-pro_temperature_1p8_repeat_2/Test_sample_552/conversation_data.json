    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will research the specific citations and influences mentioned in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n2.  I will verify if any \"lectures\" were explicitly cited, which is unlikely for a formal paper. It is more probable that he built upon the established theoretical work of other physicists.\n3.  I will identify the primary physicist whose work on statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat formed the foundation for Einstein's paper.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information and prints the answer in a clear, explanatory sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_foundational_scientist():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose\n  work was foundational to Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion is famous for its lack\n  # of citations to other contemporary or past work on the subject.\n  # He did not formally cite anyone's \"lectures\".\n  # However, the paper's entire theoretical framework is built upon the\n  # principles of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat.\n  # The primary architect of this field was an Austrian physicist.\n  \n  scientist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n  \n  print(\"While Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion does not formally cite anyone's lectures, it is fundamentally based on the work on statistical mechanics developed by:\")\n  print(scientist)\n\nfind_foundational_scientist()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
