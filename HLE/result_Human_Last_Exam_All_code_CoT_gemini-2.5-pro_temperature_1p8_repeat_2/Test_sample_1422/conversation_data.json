    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological formulas that relate the properties of any Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Theory**: We'll assume the most common type of interacting scalar field theory, which is the **ϕ⁴ theory**. In this theory, each interaction vertex involves four scalar field lines.\n2.  **State the Topological Formulas**: There are two key formulas relating the number of loops (L), vertices (V), internal lines (I), and external lines (E) in a diagram:\n    *   The loop formula: `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   The vertex formula (for ϕⁿ theory): `n * V = 2 * I + E`. For ϕ⁴ theory, this is `4 * V = 2 * I + E`.\n3.  **Combine the Formulas**: We will algebraically combine these two equations to get a single equation that relates the number of vertices (V) to the number of loops (L) and external lines (E). This eliminates the need to count internal lines (I).\n4.  **Minimize the Vertices**: The problem specifies the number of loops (`L=2`). To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we must find the minimum possible number of external lines (E). In ϕ⁴ theory, the number of external lines must be even. The smallest possible even number is 0, which corresponds to a \"vacuum bubble\" diagram (a process with no incoming or outgoing particles).\n5.  **Calculate the Result**: By substituting `L=2` and `E=0` into our combined formula for a ϕ⁴ theory, we can calculate the minimum number of vertices `V`.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan, showing each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop\n    Feynman diagram in a phi-4 scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters for the problem.\n    # L is the number of loops.\n    # n is the number of fields per interaction vertex.
