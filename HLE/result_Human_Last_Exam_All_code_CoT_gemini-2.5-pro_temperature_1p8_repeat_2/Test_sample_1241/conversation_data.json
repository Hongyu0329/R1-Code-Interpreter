    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state solution of the given system of differential equations. The steady state is the condition where the system is in equilibrium, which means the probabilities of being in each state are no longer changing over time. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the derivatives of the probabilities, $P_i'(t)$, are equal to zero. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nHere is the plan to find the solution:\n1.  **Set up the Steady-State Equations:** We will replace all derivatives $P_i'(t)$ with 0 in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman equations. This will convert the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n2.  **Use the Normalization Condition:** The sum of probabilities for all possible states must be 1. So, we add the equation $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$ to our system.\n3.  **Solve the Linear System:** We will solve this system of equations. A common method, which I will use, is to express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ as multiples of $\\pi_1$.\n4.  **Find the Value of $\\pi_1$:** By substituting the expressions from the previous step into the normalization equation, we can solve for the numerical value of $\\pi_1$.\n5.  **Calculate $\\pi_0$:** With the value of $\\pi_1$ known, we can find the value of $\\pi_0$.\n6.  **Compute the Final Result:** Finally, we will calculate the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$ as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_steady_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the steady-state problem for the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given transition rates\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    # At steady state (t -> +inf), all P_i'(t) = 0.\n    # Let pi_i = P_i(+inf).
