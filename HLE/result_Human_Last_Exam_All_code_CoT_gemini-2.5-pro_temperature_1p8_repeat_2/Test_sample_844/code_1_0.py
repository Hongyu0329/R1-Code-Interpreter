    # --- Background Information & Inferences from the text ---
    # 1. CA biotype: Watermelon-adapted, thrives on sucrose:raffinose (3:8).
    #    Inference: Watermelon is rich in raffinose. CA can metabolize raffinose well.
    # 2. MA biotype: Cotton-adapted, thrives on sucrose only.
    #    Inference: Cotton is rich in sucrose and poor in raffinose.
    # 3. Host Transfer: CA moves to cotton; MA moves to watermelon.
    # 4. Biological Principle: Galactosidase is an enzyme that metabolizes raffinose.
    #    Enzyme production is often induced by its substrate.
    #    (i.e., more raffinose -> more galactosidase; less raffinose -> less galactosidase).

                  "The removal of the enzyme's substrate (raffinose) is the direct cause for the "

                  "is a less direct and speculative explanation. In biology, misattributing the primary cause "
