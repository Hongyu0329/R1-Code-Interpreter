    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nThe user's request is a trivia question about a specific scene in an Oscar-nominated film. The key elements are a character, sealing his fate, the phrase \"Thank you,\" and boarding a bus. While the specific combination of these details does not perfectly match a single famous scene, the most probable answer is a well-known film where a character seals his fate through an unfortunate turn of phrase. The user may be slightly misremembering the setting and exact words. I will identify the most likely film and then, as per the instructions, provide a Python script to print the title of the film.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the film based on the user's query.\n\n    The query describes a character sealing his fate by saying something\n    while boarding a bus in an Oscar-nominated film. This strongly points\n    to a misremembered but iconic scene from The Godfather Part II.\n\n    In the film, the character Fredo Corleone seals his own fate by\n    accidentally revealing his betrayal to his brother, Michael. While the\n    exact words are not \"Thank you\" and the setting is not a bus, it is\n    the most famous example of a character sealing their doom with their\n    own words in an Oscar-nominated movie.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"The Godfather Part II\"\n    print(film_title)\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<The Godfather Part II>>>"
