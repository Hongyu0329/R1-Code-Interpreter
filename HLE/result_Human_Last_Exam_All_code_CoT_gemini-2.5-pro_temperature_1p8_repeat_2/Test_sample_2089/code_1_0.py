    This function identifies the film based on the user's query.

    The query describes a character sealing his fate by saying something
    while boarding a bus in an Oscar-nominated film. This strongly points
    to a misremembered but iconic scene from The Godfather Part II.

    In the film, the character Fredo Corleone seals his own fate by
    accidentally revealing his betrayal to his brother, Michael. While the
    exact words are not "Thank you" and the setting is not a bus, it is
    the most famous example of a character sealing their doom with their
    own words in an Oscar-nominated movie.
