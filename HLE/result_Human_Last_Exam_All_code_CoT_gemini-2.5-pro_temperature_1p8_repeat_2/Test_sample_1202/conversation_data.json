    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants me to solve a multiple-choice biology question using code. I need to provide a single Python or shell script block that explains the logic and outputs the final answer in the format `<<<ANSWER>>>`.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Biological Question:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism for the \"retention and divergence\" of duplicate genes.\n    *   **Gene Duplication:** A gene is copied, creating redundancy.\n    *   **Fate of the duplicate:** What happens next?\n        *   It can be lost (deleted).\n        *   It can become a non-functional pseudogene.\n        *   It can be kept (retained).\n    *   If retained, the two copies can change over time (diverge). The question is about mechanisms that explain both retention and divergence.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes homologous sequences identical. It works *against* divergence. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** One copy becomes non-functional. While the sequence is retained and diverges (through random mutation), its *function* is lost. The question implies retention of a *useful* gene. This is a common fate, but not the primary mechanism for retaining *functional* duplicates.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** One copy keeps the original function, while the duplicate acquires a new, beneficial function through mutation. This explains both **retention** (the new function is useful) and **divergence** (the sequence changes to create the new function). This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** The ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns. After duplication, each copy specializes, losing some ancestral functions but retaining others, such that both are now required to fulfill the original complete role. This also explains both **retention** (both copies are needed) and **divergence** (they diverge in regulation and/or sequence to specialize). This is also a very strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macro-evolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism of gene evolution. It operates at the wrong biological scale. So, this is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates (C vs. D):**\n    *   Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are the primary accepted models for the retention of functional gene duplicates.\n    *   The question includes the phrase \"most likely\". This is the tie-breaker.\n    *   Subfunctionalization depends on relatively common loss-of-function mutations that knock out one part of a gene's role.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a rarer gain-of-function mutation that creates a completely new, beneficial role.\n    *   From a probability standpoint, it is considered more likely that a gene duplicate is first preserved through subfunctionalization (a more passive, higher-probability process). This retention then provides the evolutionary time for a new function to potentially evolve later.\n    *   Therefore, subfunctionalization is often considered the \"most likely\" mechanism for the *initial retention* that prevents the duplicate from becoming a pseudogene.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Plan for the Code:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to model this decision-making process.\n    *   The script will define a list of dictionaries, one for each answer choice.\n    *   Each dictionary will contain the term, a description, and flags indicating whether it explains retention and divergence. I'll add a \"likelihood score\" to help programmatically determine the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n    *   The script will iterate through each option, printing its definition and an analysis based on the flags.\n    *   Finally, it will use the likelihood scores to identify and print the best answer, along with the reasoning. Subfunctionalization (D) will be assigned the highest likelihood score based on the reasoning above.\n\nThis structured approach allows the code to serve as a tool for explaining the biological concepts and transparently arriving at the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes\n    to determine the most likely one based on established evolutionary models.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data structure representing the answer choices and their biological relevance.\n    # Scores are assigned based on a simplified model:\n    # - +10 if it's a primary mechanism for retaining functional duplicates.\n    # - A bonus is added for likelihood, with Subfunctionalization being more probable for initial retention.\n    options = [\n        {\n            'id': 'A',\n            'term': 'Gene conversion',\n            'description': 'A process that erases differences between duplicate genes, making them identical.
