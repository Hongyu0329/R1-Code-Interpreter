No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral. The use of coordinates perpendicular to the radial direction is a common and practical approximation for data analysis based on Taylor's "frozen-in flow" hypothesis, though a more rigorous analysis would use a field-aligned coordinate system.
