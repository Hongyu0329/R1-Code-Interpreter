    "This is a fascinating question that delves into a subtle area of crystal optics. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concepts:** The question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, and exhibit **optical activity**.\n2.  **Identify the Contradiction:** The fundamental rule is that optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light) is a hallmark of chirality. An achiral object, by definition, cannot be superimposed on its mirror image and should not be optically active.\n3.  **Resolve the Contradiction:** The question must be referring to a higher-order effect known as **optical activity by spatial dispersion**. This phenomenon can occur in specific directions within certain achiral crystals that lack a center of inversion.\n4.  **Establish the Criteria:** Therefore, we are looking for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions:\n    *   They must be **achiral** (possess a mirror plane or rotoinversion axis).\n    *   They must be **non-polar** (do not have a unique polar direction).\n    *   They must be **non-centrosymmetric** (lack a center of inversion), as this is a prerequisite for spatial dispersion gyrotropy.\n5.  **Filter the Crystal Classes:** We will systematically check the properties of the classes listed in the options to see which ones meet all three criteria. Authoritative physics texts (like J.F. Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\" or V.A. Kizel's review \"Gyrotropy of Crystals\") have established which non-centrosymmetric achiral classes permit this effect. The definitive set is: `-4`, `-42m`, and `-43m`. The classes `-6` and `-62m` are ruled out by most authorities because their symmetry (specifically a horizontal mirror plane) forces the gyration tensor to be zero.\n6.  **Evaluate the Options:** The code below will define the properties of the relevant crystal classes and check which of the options (A, B, C, D, E) aligns with our derived list of correct classes (`-4`, `-42m`, `-43m`).\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by analyzing crystal class properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the problem and the core contradiction.\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the user's question.\")\n    print(\"The user wants to find crystal classes that are simultaneously:\")\n    print(\"  a) Achiral (cannot be optically active in the conventional sense)\")\n    print(\"  b) Non-polar\")\n    print(\"  c) Optically Active\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is a paradox.
