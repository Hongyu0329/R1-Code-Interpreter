The repair method described is a 'build-up of layers of filler material'. This implies adding material to a component where it has been lost in order to restore its original geometry. Let's evaluate the options based on this:

A. Stress Corrosion Cracking & E. Fatigue Cracking: These are crack formations. While welding can repair cracks, the term 'build-up' is more specific to restoring lost volume.

D. Creep Deformation: This is the slow stretching of the blade. It's a change in shape, not a loss of material that would be fixed by adding layers.

B. Foreign Object Damage (FOD): This causes nicks and gouges, which is a loss of material. Welding is used to fill these voids, making this a strong candidate.

F. High-Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion: This is surface material loss. While it is material loss, a 'build-up' by manual TIG welding is typically for more localized, significant damage rather than generalized surface thinning.

C. Blade Tip Rub and Wear: This is a predictable and common form of damage where the end of the blade wears down due to contact with the casing. This creates a clear loss of material at the tip. The standard repair is to use TIG welding to add, or 'build-up', material back onto the tip, which is then machined to the correct dimensions. This perfectly matches the description of the repair process.

Conclusion: While FOD is also repaired by welding, Blade Tip Rub and Wear is a classic and primary example of damage addressed by building up material with TIG welding to restore geometrical integrity.
