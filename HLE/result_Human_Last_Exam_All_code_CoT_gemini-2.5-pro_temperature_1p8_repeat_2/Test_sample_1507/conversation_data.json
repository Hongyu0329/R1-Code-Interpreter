    "To solve this, we need to understand the structure of the great icosahedron and its \"outer-hull\".\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Shape:** The \"outer-hull\" of a great icosahedron, which represents its visible surface from the outside, is its convex hull. The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a **regular icosahedron**.\n2.  **Analyze the Faces:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid made up of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n3.  **Count the Triangles:** Since the visible surface is already composed of triangles, the minimal number of triangles needed for its triangulation is simply the number of its faces.\n4.  **Demonstrate with Code:** I will use Python to calculate the number of faces of a regular icosahedron using Euler's Polyhedron Formula (V - E + F = 2), given its number of vertices (V) and edges (E). This confirms the number of faces is 20.\n\n```python\ndef solve_great_icosahedron_triangles():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of visible triangles on the surface of a great icosahedron.\n    This corresponds to the number of faces of its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n    vertices = 12\n    edges = 30\n\n    # According to Euler's formula for polyhedra: V - E + F = 2.\n    # We can find the number of faces (F) by rearranging the formula to F = 2 - V + E.\n    # Since the faces of an icosahedron are triangles, this number is our answer.\n    num_faces = 2 - vertices + edges\n\n    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n    print(f\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(f\"The number of vertices (V) is {vertices}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of edges (E) is {edges}.\")\n    print(f\"Using Euler's formula V - E + F = 2, we calculate the number of faces (F).\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: F = 2 - {vertices} + {edges}\")\n    print(f\"The minimal number of visible triangles is: {num_faces}\")\n\nsolve_great_icosahedron_triangles()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
