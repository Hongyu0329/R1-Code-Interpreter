    "To answer this question, I will identify the film that fits the criteria by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Luxor Obelisks:** There are two, one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Scan the List of Best Picture Winners:** I will go through the list of Oscar winners for Best Picture chronologically.\n3.  **Cross-reference Locations:** I will look for films set in either Paris or Luxor.\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Depiction:**\n    *   Several Best Picture winners are set in Paris. The film *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is an early candidate, but it's difficult to confirm if the obelisk is shown.\n    *   The film *An American in Paris*, which won for the year 1951, features a famous 17-minute ballet sequence at the end. This sequence is a fantasy tour of Paris, and it explicitly includes a stylized depiction of the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk as its centerpiece.\n    *   Later films like *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) also show the obelisk, but *An American in Paris* is the first confirmed winner to depict it.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the movie and the year it won Best Picture.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the first Academy Award Best Picture winner\n    to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"An American in Paris\"\n    award_year = 1951  # The year for which the award was given\n    obelisk_location = \"Place de la Concorde, Paris\"\n\n    print(f\"The first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk was '{movie_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"It won the award for the year {award_year}.\")\n    print(f\"The film depicts the obelisk located in the {obelisk_location} during its final ballet sequence.\")\n\nfind_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
