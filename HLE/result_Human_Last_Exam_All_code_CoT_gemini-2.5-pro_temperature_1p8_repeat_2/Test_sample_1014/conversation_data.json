    "My plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881 is as follows:\n\n1.  **Start with the number:** I will begin with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  **Trial Division Algorithm:** I will use an efficient version of trial division to find the prime factors.\n3.  **Divide by 2:** First, I'll check for divisibility by 2 and divide `n` by 2 until it's no longer even. I will add 2 to a list of factors for each successful division.\n4.  **Divide by odd numbers:** Since all factors of 2 are removed, I only need to check for odd divisors. I will iterate through odd numbers (`d = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining `n`.\n5.  **Factor Extraction:** For each divisor `d`, I will repeatedly divide `n` by `d` as long as it's divisible, adding `d` to my list of factors each time.\n6.  **The Last Factor:** After the loop finishes, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining value itself is a prime factor. This happens when the last factor is larger than the square root of the original number.\n7.  **Final Equation:** I will then construct and print the factorization equation, showing the original number and all its prime factors (e.g., `8139881 = factor1 * factor2`).\n8.  **Find the Maximum:** Finally, I will identify and print the largest number from the list of prime factors.\n\nThis process guarantees finding all prime factors and, consequently, the largest one.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the prime factors of a given number, prints the factorization\n    equation, and then outputs the largest prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number we want to factor\n    num = 8139881\n    n = num\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle any factors of 2 first\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Now, handle odd factors starting from 3\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the remaining number n\n    d = 3\n    while d * d <= n:\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            n //= d\n        d += 2\n\n    # If n is still greater than 1 at this point, it must be a prime factor itself\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Print the factorization equation, showing each number involved\n    if factors:\n        equation_str = \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n        print(f\"{num} = {equation_str}\")\n        \n        # Find and print the largest prime divisor\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {num} is: {largest_prime}\")\n    elif num > 1:\n        # This case handles if the number itself is prime\n        print(f\"{num} is a prime number, so its largest prime divisor is {num}.\")\n        largest_prime = num\n    else:\n        print(f\"{num} does not have prime divisors greater than 1.\")\n        largest_prime = None\n\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<2873>>>"
