    # The prompt describes a pirouette preparation from a fourth position plié (bent knees)
    # with arms in an 'allongé' (extended/stretched) position.

    # Analysis of the answer choices:
    # A. Paris Opera Ballet School (Yes) and the Royal Ballet School (No)
    # B. Paris Opera Ballet School (Yes) and School of American Ballet (Yes)
    # C. La Scala (No) and the Vaganova Academy (Partial fit)
    # D. The Royal Ballet School (No) and the Vaganova Academy (Partial fit)
    # E. The Royal Ballet School (No) and School of American Ballet (Yes)

    # Reasoning:
    # The School of American Ballet (Balanchine style) famously uses a dynamic, wide "wind-up" with
    # extended arms for pirouettes.
    # The Paris Opera Ballet School (French style) also uses an allongé quality, opening the arms
    # wide through second position as part of the preparation.
    # Other schools like the Royal Ballet and La Scala (Cecchetti) typically use rounded arm
    # preparations in fourth or fifth position, not allongé. The Vaganova preparation has only
    # one arm extended to the side while the other is in first position.

    # Therefore, the pair where both institutions fit the description is B.
