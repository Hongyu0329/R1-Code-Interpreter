    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  I will first define the given 3x3 matrix `A` using the `numpy` library in Python. The information about `m_{1/2} = 13` is not needed since the matrix is already specified.\n2.  To compute the determinant, I will use the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix:\n    `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n    where a, b, c, ... i are the elements of the matrix.\n3.  I will write a Python script that substitutes the numerical values from the given matrix `A` into this formula.\n4.  The script will print out the calculation step-by-step, showing how the numbers are plugged into the formula and the result of each intermediate step.\n5.  Finally, the script will display the final computed value of the determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the adjacency matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\nprint(\"The adjacency matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nTo compute the determinant, we use the formula:\")\nprint(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\n# Extract the elements of the matrix\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the terms\nterm1_inner = e * i - f * h\nterm2_inner = d * i - f * g\nterm3_inner = d * h - e * g\n\nterm1 = a * term1_inner\nterm2 = b * term2_inner\nterm3 = c * term3_inner\n\n# The final result\ndeterminant = term1 - term2 + term3\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation with all the numbers\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\nprint(f\"       = ({a}) * ({e*i} - {f*h}) - ({b}) * ({d*i} - {f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h} - {e*g})\")\nprint(f\"       = ({a}) * ({term1_inner}) - ({b}) * ({term2_inner}) + ({c}) * ({term3_inner})\")\nprint(f\"       = ({term1}) - ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\nprint(f\"       = {term1} + {-term2} + {term3}\")\nprint(f\"       = {determinant}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe determinant of the adjacency matrix is: {determinant}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
