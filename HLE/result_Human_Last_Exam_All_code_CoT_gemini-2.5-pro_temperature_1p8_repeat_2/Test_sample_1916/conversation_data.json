    "A category with one object is equivalent to a mathematical structure called a monoid.\n\nLet's break down why:\n1.  **Object**: The category has one object, let's call it `X`.\n2.  **Morphisms**: All morphisms in this category are arrows from `X` to `X` (endomorphisms). The problem states there are 3 such morphisms. Let's call the set of these morphisms `M = {m₁, m₂, m₃}`.\n3.  **Identity**: Every category must have an identity morphism for each object. So, one of our 3 morphisms must be the identity, let's call it `id`. Let `M = {id, a, b}`.\n4.  **Composition**: The category must have a composition rule `∘`, which in this case is a binary operation on the set `M`: `∘: M × M → M`.\n5.  **Axioms**: This composition must be associative (`(f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)`) and have `id` as its identity element (`f ∘ id = id ∘ f = f`).\n\nA set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is precisely the definition of a monoid. Therefore, a category with one object is determined by the monoid of its endomorphisms.\n\nThe question \"How many categories with 3 morphisms and one object are there, up to isomorphism?\" is equivalent to \"How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?\".\n\nWe can solve this computationally by following these steps:\n1.  Define the set of morphisms as `{e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity. For programming, we can use numbers `{0, 1, 2}`.\n2.  A specific monoid structure is defined by the multiplication table. Since the products involving the identity `e` are fixed (e.g., `e∘a=a`), we only need to define the four products of non-identity elements: `a∘a`, `a∘b`, `b∘a`, and `b∘b`.\n3.  Each of these four products can be `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives `3⁴ = 81` possible multiplication tables.\n4.  We iterate through all 81 possibilities and check which ones satisfy the associativity axiom. This yields a list of all valid monoids of order 3.\n5.  Finally, we group these valid monoids by isomorphism. For a monoid on `{e, a, b}`, an isomorphism must map `e` to `e`. The only non-trivial isomorphism to consider is the one that swaps `a` and `b`. Two monoids are isomorphic if one's table can be transformed into the other's by swapping the roles of `a` and `b`. We count the number of unique groups (isomorphism classes).\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    This is equivalent to the number of categories with one object and 3 morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We represent the monoid elements as e=0, a=1, b=2.\n    # A monoid's structure is defined by the multiplication table for a and b.\n    # The table is represented by a tuple (a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b).\n    options = [0, 1, 2]\n    \n    associative_monoids = []\n\n    # 1.
