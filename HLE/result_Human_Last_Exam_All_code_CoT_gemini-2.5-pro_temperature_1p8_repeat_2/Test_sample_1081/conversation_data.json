    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   **Format:** Provide a Python or shell script for the user to execute.\n    *   **Constraints:**\n        *   Only one code block in the response.\n        *   Use `print` for output.\n        *   Explain the plan first if not provided.\n        *   Show thinking steps.\n        *   The final code must output the numbers in the \"equation\".\n        *   The final answer must be in the format `<<<answer content>>>`.\n\n2.  **Initial Analysis and Interpretation:**\n    *   The phrase \"exact number\" can be ambiguous. It could mean:\n        a) The total number of subgroups that are $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n        b) The number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of such tori.\n    *   If it means (a), the answer would be a very complex polynomial in $q$. The number of tori in a single conjugacy class is $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| / |N_G(T)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$, and one would have to sum this over all conjugacy classes. The order of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is a huge polynomial, and the normalizer orders are also functions of $q$. The problem does not provide enough information and the result would not be a single \"number\".\n    *   If it means (b), the answer is a constant, independent of the field size $q$. This is a standard and well-known result in the theory of algebraic groups. Given the phrasing, this interpretation is far more likely. I will proceed with interpretation (b).\n\n3.  **Formulating the Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1: State the key theorem.** I need to recall the theorem that connects the number of conjugacy classes of maximal tori to a property of the Weyl group. The theorem states that for a split reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n    *   **Step 2: Identify the specific Weyl group.** The problem specifies that $G$ is of type $E_8$. The corresponding Weyl group is denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n    *   **Step 3: Find the number of conjugacy classes of W(E8).** This is a well-established fact in mathematics. I need to find this number from a reliable source (e.g., textbook on Lie theory, specialized database like OEIS, or computational algebra system like GAP/SageMath). I recall, or would look up, that this number is 112. The character table for $W(E_8)$ has been computed, and its dimension is 112x112, confirming there are 112 conjugacy classes.\n    *   **Step 4: Synthesize the answer and create the script.** The final answer is the number found in Step 3. I will create a Python script that explains this reasoning and prints the final result in the requested format. The script won't perform a live calculation, as that would require specialized libraries, but it will present the logic and the answer clearly. The script will also satisfy the constraint \"output each number in the final equation\" by explicitly printing the logical chain, e.g., `Number of tori classes = Number of W(E8) conjugacy classes = 112`.\n\n4.  **Executing the Plan:**\n    *   **Text Explanation:** I will write a clear, step-by-step explanation preceding the code block.\n    *   **Python Code:** I'll write a simple Python script.\n        *   It will use `print()` statements to lay out the argument.\n        *   It will print the key theorem.\n        *   It will state that the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n        *   It will conclude with the final numerical answer, showing the \"equation\".\n    *   **Final Answer Tag:** After the code block, I will add the final answer in the `<<<...>>>` format.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that I correctly interpret the mathematical question, follow all the user's formatting and content instructions, and provide a clear, well-reasoned solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_e8_tori():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E8.\n\n    The plan is as follows:\n    1. Interpret the question: The question asks for the number of conjugacy classes of Fq-rational maximal tori,\n       as this number is a constant independent of q. The total number of individual tori would be a complex polynomial in q.\n    2. Apply the relevant theorem: A central result in the theory of reductive algebraic groups states that for a split\n       group G over a finite field Fq, the number of G(Fq)-conjugacy classes of Fq-rational maximal tori is equal\n       to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group, W.\n    3. Identify the Weyl group: For a group G of type E8, the corresponding Weyl group is W(E8).\n    4. Find the number of conjugacy classes of W(E8): This is a known value in mathematics. The number of conjugacy classes\n       of the Weyl group W(E8) is 112. This is famously the dimension of the character table of W(E8).\n    5. Present the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The problem asks for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a group G of type E_8.\")\n    print(\"This is interpreted as finding the number of G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of such tori.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: A key theorem states that the number of these conjugacy classes is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the group's Weyl group W.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: For a group of type E_8, the Weyl group is W(E_8).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E_8) is a well-known mathematical constant.\")\n    num_classes = 112\n    print(f\"The number of conjugacy classes in W(E_8) is {num_classes}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 5: Therefore, we have the following equality:\")\n    final_equation = f\"Number of F_q-rational maximal tori classes = Number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) = {num_classes}\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    \n    \nsolve_e8_tori()\n```\n<<<112>>>"
