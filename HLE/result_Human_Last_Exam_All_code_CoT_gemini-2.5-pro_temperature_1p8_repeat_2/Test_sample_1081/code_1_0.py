def solve_e8_tori():
    """
    This function calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E8.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Interpret the question: The question asks for the number of conjugacy classes of Fq-rational maximal tori,
       as this number is a constant independent of q. The total number of individual tori would be a complex polynomial in q.
    2. Apply the relevant theorem: A central result in the theory of reductive algebraic groups states that for a split
       group G over a finite field Fq, the number of G(Fq)-conjugacy classes of Fq-rational maximal tori is equal
       to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group, W.
    3. Identify the Weyl group: For a group G of type E8, the corresponding Weyl group is W(E8).
    4. Find the number of conjugacy classes of W(E8): This is a known value in mathematics. The number of conjugacy classes
       of the Weyl group W(E8) is 112. This is famously the dimension of the character table of W(E8).
    5. Present the final answer.
