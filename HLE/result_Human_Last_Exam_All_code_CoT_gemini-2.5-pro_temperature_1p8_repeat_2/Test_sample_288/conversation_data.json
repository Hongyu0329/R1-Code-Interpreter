    "To find the main synaptic target of the ASJ neurons in the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite, I will query the connectome dataset.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Access the C. elegans connectome data using the `cconnectome` Python library. This library provides programmatic access to the dataset from Witvliet et al., 2021.\n2.  Filter the synapse table to isolate all connections originating from the ASJ neurons (both ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  Group these connections by the postsynaptic (target) neuron.\n4.  Sum the number of synapses for each target neuron to find the total synaptic input it receives from ASJ.\n5.  Identify the target neuron that has the highest total number of synapses from ASJ.\n6.  Print the final result, clearly stating the source, the target, and the number of synapses.\n\n```python\nimport cconnectome as cc\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Set pandas to display all rows, to ensure the full list of targets is shown if needed\n# pandas.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\n\ndef find_main_synapse_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main synaptic target of a given neuron in the C. elegans connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Access the connectome data\n        print(\"Connecting to the C. elegans connectome dataset...\")\n        synapses_df = cc.get_synapses()\n        print(\"Successfully loaded synapse data.\")\n\n        # Step 2: Define the source neurons and filter connections\n        source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n        print(f\"Filtering for all synaptic outputs from {', '.join(source_neurons)}...\")\n        asj_outputs_df = synapses_df[synapses_df['pre_name'].isin(source_neurons)]\n\n        if asj_outputs_df.empty:\n            print(f\"No synaptic outputs found for {', '.join(source_neurons)}.\")\n            return\n\n        # Step 3 & 4: Group by target neuron and sum synapse counts\n        print(\"Aggregating synapse counts for each target neuron...\")\n        # 'weight' column represents the number of synapses in a connection\n        target_synapse_counts = asj_outputs_df.groupby('post_name')['weight'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)\n\n        # Step 5: Identify the main target\n        if target_synapse_counts.empty:\n            print(f\"Could not determine synapse counts for targets of {', '.join(source_neurons)}.\")\n            return\n\n        main_target_neuron = target_synapse_counts.index[0]\n        max_synapses = target_synapse_counts.iloc[0]\n\n        # Step 6: Print the result\n        print(\"\\n--- Result ---\")\n        print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ ({', '.join(source_neurons)}) axons is the neuron '{main_target_neuron}'.\")\n        print(f\"The total number of synapses from ASJ to {main_target_neuron} is {max_synapses}.\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure you have the 'cconnectome' library installed ('pip install cconnectome') and a working internet connection.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_main_synapse_target()\n```\n<<<AIA>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What cell is the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans in terms of synapse number?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
