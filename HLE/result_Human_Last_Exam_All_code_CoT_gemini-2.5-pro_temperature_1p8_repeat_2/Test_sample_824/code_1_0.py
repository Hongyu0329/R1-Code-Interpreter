    # Clinical Analysis:
    # The patient's long-term symptoms (facial rash, joint pain, hematuria) and acute deterioration
    # are classic for a severe flare of Lupus Nephritis, a complication of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
    
    # Pathophysiology:
    # The primary cause of kidney damage in Lupus Nephritis is the deposition of immune complexes
    # in the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli). This process activates the complement system,
    # a part of the immune response, which leads to inflammation and tissue destruction.
    
    # Lab Indication:
    # This intense activation of the complement system 'consumes' complement proteins from the blood.
    # Therefore, a sharp decrease in serum complement levels, specifically C3 and C4, is a direct
    # indicator of this ongoing immune-mediated destruction. While other markers like creatinine would
    # reflect kidney damage, low complement levels point directly to the immunological cause of the damage.

    explanation = "The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a severe flare of lupus nephritis. The rapid decline in kidney function is caused by massive deposition of immune complexes in the kidneys, which activates and consumes complement proteins. Therefore, the lab parameter that would have best indicated the immunological cause of this rapid decline is:"
    answer = "Low serum complement levels (C3 and C4)"
