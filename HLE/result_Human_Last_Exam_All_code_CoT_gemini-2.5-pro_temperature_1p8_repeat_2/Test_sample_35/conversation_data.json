    "This poker scenario involves several key factors: your stack size, your position at the table, and the tournament phase. Let's break it down to find the best course of action.\n\n**1. The Situation**\n*   **Stack Size (16bb):** With 16 big blinds, your stack is in the \"push/fold\" zone. This means your primary options are to go all-in or to fold. Calling or making a small standard raise is often incorrect because it commits a large portion of your stack without the full benefit of fold equity.\n*   **Position (UTG+1):** You are in an early position. This is a significant disadvantage because there are many players (usually 7 or 8) who will act after you. The chance that one of them has a very strong hand is high. Therefore, you must have a much stronger hand to go all-in from UTG+1 than you would from a later position.\n*   **Tournament Phase (Near the money bubble):** This is the most crucial factor. The \"bubble\" is the point just before players start getting paid. Busting out now is a financial disaster (you get nothing), while surviving guarantees a cash prize. This is known as ICM (Independent Chip Model) pressure. Due to ICM, you should be more risk-averse and play much tighter than you would in a normal tournament phase.\n\n**2. The Plan**\nMy approach will be to model this decision-making process using Python. I will define a standard, solid shoving range for UTG+1 with a 16bb stack and then check which of the provided hands fall into that range. I'll also use the code's output to explain the nuance introduced by the money bubble.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_poker_shove():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the optimal shoving hand for a specific poker scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Scenario Definition ---\n    stack_bb = 16\n    position = \"UTG+1\"\n    situation = \"Near the money bubble\"\n\n    print(\"--- Poker Scenario Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Your Stack: {stack_bb} big blinds\")\n    print(f\"Your Position: {position}\")\n    print(f\"Tournament Phase: {situation}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Key Considerations:\")\n    print(\"1.
