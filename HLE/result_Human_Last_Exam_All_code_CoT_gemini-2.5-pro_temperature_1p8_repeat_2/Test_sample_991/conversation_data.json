    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle that describes how a character is built from its components.\n\nHere is my plan to solve it:\n1.  I will analyze each part of the riddle to identify the corresponding Chinese character radicals or components.\n2.  \"A wooden stick\" points to the radical **木** (mù), which means \"wood\" or \"tree\".\n3.  \"hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\" describes the component that sits on top of the wooden stick. The \"square box\" is the frame, and the \"ladder\" is the structure inside it. This describes the character **覀** (a variant of 西, xī, meaning \"west\"), which looks like a box with ladder-like rungs inside.\n4.  By placing the \"box with a ladder\" (覀) on top of the \"wooden stick\" (木), we form the character **粟**.\n5.  I will write a Python script to print this explanation and the final character.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the Chinese character riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    riddle = \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.\"\n    \n    print(f\"The riddle is: \\\"{riddle}\\\"\\n\")\n    print(\"Let's break down the character based on the riddle's clues:\")\n    \n    # First part of the riddle\n    part1_desc = \"1.

This component sits on top of the 'wooden stick'.\")\n                  \n    # Final character\n    final_char = \"粟\"\n    final_pronunciation = \"sù\"\n    final_meaning = \"grain or millet\"\n    \n    print(part1_desc)\n    print(f\"   - {part1_expl}\\n\")\n    \n    print(part2_desc)\n    print(f\"   - {part2_expl}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Putting these two parts together, with 覀 on top of 木, we get the final answer.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The Chinese character is: {final_char}\")\n    print(f\"Pronunciation: {final_pronunciation}\")\n    print(f\"Meaning: {final_meaning}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<粟>>>"
