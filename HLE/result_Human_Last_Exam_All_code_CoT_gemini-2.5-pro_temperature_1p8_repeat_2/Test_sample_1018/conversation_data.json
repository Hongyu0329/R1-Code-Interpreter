    "To solve this problem, we need to compute the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface:** The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 2$ is given by the formula $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$. This result is derived from the fact that such surfaces are hyperbolic, and their simplicial volume is proportional to their hyperbolic volume.\n2.  **Product Formula:** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by Gromov's product formula:\n    $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n3.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   First, we calculate the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$. Here, the genus $g_1 = 31$ and the dimension $m = 2$.\n    *   Second, we calculate the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$. Here, the genus $g_2 = 17$ and the dimension $n = 2$.\n    *   Third, we calculate the binomial coefficient $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2}$.\n    *   Finally, we multiply these three values together to get the simplicial volume of the product space $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the genera of the surfaces\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# The dimension of a surface is 2\nm = 2\nn = 2\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the simplicial volume of Sigma_g1\n# The formula for g >= 2 is ||Sigma_g|| = 4 * (g - 1)\nsv1 = 4 * (g1 - 1)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of Sigma_g2\nsv2 = 4 * (g2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient for the product formula\n# C(m+n, m)\ntotal_dim = m + n\ncoeff = math.comb(total_dim, m)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final simplicial volume of the product\nfinal_sv = coeff * sv1 * sv2\n\n# Print the result in the format of the full equation\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2} is computed using the product formula:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = C({total_dim}, {m}) * ||Σ_{g1}|| * ||Σ_{g2}||\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * ({g1} - 1) = {sv1}\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * ({g2} - 1) = {sv2}\")\nprint(f\"C({total_dim}, {m}) = {coeff}\")\nprint(\"\\nPutting it all together:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = {coeff} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {final_sv}\")\n\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
