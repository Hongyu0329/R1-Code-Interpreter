# The final answer is determined by solving a three-part literary puzzle.
# Part A asks to identify a Sherlock Holmes story based on a couplet from Nabokov's "Pale Fire".
# The allusion is a misattribution; a correct answer acknowledges the novel's internal flawed commentary,
# which points toward "The Final Problem, Moriarty".
part_a_answer = 3

# Part B asks which theme this allusion underscores. The flawed reference to the master of deduction,
# Holmes, perfectly illustrates the theme of "the impossibility of reliable inference".
part_b_answer = 6

# Part C asks which of Nabokov's prior works most involved "intricate back-referencing".
# This is his massive translation and commentary on Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin".
part_c_answer = 7

# The problem states that the sum of the three numbers must be a multiple of 8.
total = part_a_answer + part_b_answer + part_c_answer

# We will print the three numbers separated by spaces, as requested.
# For clarity and to demonstrate the constraint is met, we also show the final equation.
print(f"The final answers are: {part_a_answer} {part_b_answer} {part_c_answer}")
print(f"The equation demonstrating the sum is: {part_a_answer} + {part_b_answer} + {part_c_answer} = {total}, which is a multiple of 8.")

# The required final output format is just the numbers themselves.
print("\n<<<3 6 7>>>")
