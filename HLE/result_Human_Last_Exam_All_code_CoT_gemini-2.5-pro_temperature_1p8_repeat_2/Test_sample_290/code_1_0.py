    This function solves the geometry problem by reasoning step-by-step.

    Problem Summary:
    - A set of n points S = {P1, ..., Pn} are equidistant from a point O (i.e., on a circle).
    - The total set of points is T = S U {O}.
    - 9 straight lines must be drawn such that any point in T can be reached from any other point in T
      by travelling along at most 2 of these lines.
    - Goal: Find the maximum value of n.
    """

    # Step 1: Determine the absolute maximum number of points (n) on the circle.
    # A single line can intersect a circle at most twice.
    # With 9 lines, we can have at most 9 * 2 intersection points.
    num_lines = 9
    max_points_per_line_on_circle = 2
    
    # This gives an upper bound for n.
    theoretical_max_n = num_lines * max_points_per_line_on_circle

    # Step 2: Propose a configuration that achieves this maximum and verify it.
    # Configuration: Let all 9 lines pass through the center O.
    # Let the n points be the intersections of these lines with the circle.
    # n would then be 18, with each line containing 2 points.
    # The set of all points is T = {O, P1, ..., P18}.

    # Step 3: Verify the connectivity condition for this configuration.
    # Let A and B be any two points in T.
    # Case 1: One point is O. (e.g., A=O, B=Pk).
    #   - Pk lies on some line Lj.
    #   - Since all lines pass through O, O is also on Lj.
    #   - Connection is 1 line. Condition met.
    #
    # Case 2: Both points are on the circle. (A=Pi, B=Pj).
    #   - Pi is on line La, Pj is on line Lb.
    #   - If La == Lb, connection is 1 line. Condition met.
    #   - If La != Lb, both lines pass through O, so they intersect at O.
    #     The path Pi -> O -> Pj uses 2 lines. Condition met.
    #
    # Conclusion: The configuration works for n=18. Since n cannot exceed 18,
    # this is the maximum possible value.

    # Step 4: Output the final answer and the equation.
