    "Of course! Here is a plan and the corresponding Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Barbell Graph**: A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques), each with 5 nodes. These two cliques are connected by a single bridge edge, which is the \"bottleneck\".\n2.  **Identify Key Nodes and Degrees**: Let the bottleneck edge connect node `u` in the first clique and node `v` in the second.\n    *   Any node in a complete graph of 5 nodes (`K_5`) has `5 - 1 = 4` connections to other nodes within its clique.\n    *   The degree of node `u` is its 4 connections within its clique plus the 1 connection across the bottleneck. Thus, `degree(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, `degree(v) = 5`.\n3.  **Model Uniform Gossiping**: In randomized uniform gossiping, each node contacts a random neighbor with uniform probability. For a node `i`, the probability of contacting any specific neighbor is `1 / degree(i)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is \"sampled\" if node `u` chooses to contact `v`, OR if node `v` chooses to contact `u`. Let `P(A)` be the probability that `u` chooses `v`, and `P(B)` be the probability that `v` chooses `u`.\n    *   `P(A) = 1 / degree(u) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(B) = 1 / degree(v) = 1/5`.\n    *   Since each node makes its choice independently, the probability that the edge is sampled is `P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B)`.\n5.  **Compute the Final Answer**: Substitute the probabilities into the formula and calculate the result. The script will print out each step of the logic, the final equation with the numbers plugged in, and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters of the barbell graph.\ntotal_nodes = 10\n# A standard barbell graph splits the nodes into two equal-sized cliques.\nclique_size = total_nodes // 2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n# A node in a complete graph (clique) of size n has degree n-1 within that clique.\ndegree_internal = clique_size - 1\n# The nodes connected to the bottleneck have their internal connections plus the bridge.\ndegree_bottleneck_node = degree_internal + 1\n\n# Step 3: In uniform gossiping, the probability of selecting a neighbor is 1/degree.\n# Let P(A) be the probability of the first node choosing the second.\nprob_A = fractions.Fraction(1, degree_bottleneck_node)\n# Let P(B) be the probability of the second node choosing the first.\nprob_B = fractions.Fraction(1, degree_bottleneck_node)\n\n# Step 4: The bottleneck edge is sampled if A or B happens.\n# Since the choices are independent, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B).\ntotal_prob = prob_A + prob_B - (prob_A * prob_B)\n\n# Print the explanation and the final result.\nprint(f\"A barbell graph with {total_nodes} nodes has two cliques of size {clique_size}.\")\nprint(f\"The nodes connecting the cliques each have a degree of ({clique_size} - 1) + 1 = {degree_bottleneck_node}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the probability that either node connected by it chooses the other.\")\nprint(\"This is calculated as P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B), where A and B are the events of each node choosing the other.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n# Output each number in the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"P(bottleneck sampled) = {prob_A} + {prob_B} - ({prob_A} * {prob_B}) = {total_prob}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe decimal value of this probability is {float(total_prob)}.\")\n\n```\n<<<9/25>>>"
