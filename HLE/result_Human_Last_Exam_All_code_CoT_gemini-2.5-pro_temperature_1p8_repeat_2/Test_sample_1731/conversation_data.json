    "I will now outline the plan to solve this task.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Theoretical Foundation**: I will start by explaining the connection between the user's prompt (Boltzmann-Sanov, Cramer-Chernoff theorems) and the physical problem of finding the equilibrium state of a photon gas. This involves maximizing the statistical entropy (`S = k_B log W`) subject to the constraint of a constant average energy `E`. This maximization procedure is a direct application of large deviation principles.\n2.  **Derivation Summary**: The maximization leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons. Integrating this distribution over the density of states for photons in a 3D box gives the macroscopic equilibrium properties.\n3.  **Symbolic Formulas**: I will present the resulting symbolic formulas for the equilibrium mean energy `E(V, T)` and entropy `S(V, T)`, which are functions of volume `V` and temperature `T`. These are the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy and the corresponding entropy relation.\n4.  **Python Implementation**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   First, prints the theoretical explanation and the symbolic formulas.\n    *   Defines the necessary physical constants (`k_B`, `h`, `c`).\n    *   Performs a numerical calculation for a specific case (e.g., `V = 1 m³`, `T = 300 K`).\n    *   Prints the steps of the calculation, showing how the constants are substituted into the formulas, to satisfy the requirement of outputting \"each number in the final equation\".\n    *   Finally, prints the calculated numerical values for `E` and `S`.\n\nThis approach provides the user with both the theoretical underpinning and a practical, executable code solution to find the \"equilibrium values\".\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a photon gas\n    using principles of statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # 1.

This process is fundamentally governed by the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n- Boltzmann's Entropy Formula (S = k_B * log W): This relates the entropy (S) of a macrostate to its number of microstates (W). Equilibrium corresponds to the macrostate with the maximum W, and thus maximum entropy.\n\n- Large Deviation Theory (e.g., Sanov's Theorem): This framework formalizes Boltzmann's principle. It shows that the probability of observing a system in a non-equilibrium state is exponentially small. The equilibrium state, being the most probable, is the one that minimizes the 'distance' (rate function) from the true distribution.\n\n- The Method of Lagrange Multipliers: This is the mathematical tool used to maximize the entropy (W) subject to physical constraints, such as a fixed total average energy <E>. For photons (bosons with no conserved number), this leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution.\n\n- Cramer-Chernoff Theorem: This theorem provides a powerful link between the large deviation rate function (which is related to entropy) and the logarithm of the partition function.\n\nFollowing this procedure—maximizing entropy for bosons with no number conservation—we first derive the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons. Then, by integrating this over the density of states for photons in a 3D volume, we can find the macroscopic equilibrium values for the total mean energy (E) and entropy (S) as a function of temperature (T) and volume (V).\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\n    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # 2.
