    print("Analyzing the truth value of each statement:\n")

    # Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.
    print("A. This statement is TRUE.")
    print("   The SVM decision boundary is determined by support vectors from both classes. In the dual formulation of SVM, there's a constraint `sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0`, where `y_i` are the class labels (+1 or -1) and `alpha_i` are non-negative Lagrange multipliers that are non-zero only for support vectors. If all support vectors were from one class (e.g., `y_i = +1` for all `i` where `alpha_i > 0`), this sum could not be zero. Therefore, support vectors must come from both classes.\n")

    # Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.
    print("B. This statement is TRUE.")
    print("   This is the principle behind class-weighted or cost-sensitive SVMs. By assigning a higher penalty (C parameter) for misclassifying the minority class, the model is forced to pay more attention to it. This can result in a decision boundary that is closer to the majority class, effectively creating unequal margins to achieve better overall classification performance on imbalanced data.\n")

    # Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.
    print("C. This statement is TRUE.")
    print("   This is the essence of the 'kernel trick'. Kernels like the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel correspond to a mapping into an infinite-dimensional feature space. The SVM algorithm, however, only requires the dot products of vectors in this space, not the vectors themselves. The kernel function calculates this dot product directly using the original, lower-dimensional data, making the computation highly tractable.\n")

    # Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.
    print("D. This statement is TRUE.")
    print("   The SVM decision boundary and margins are defined exclusively by the support vectors (the points on the margin or within it). Points that are correctly classified and lie outside the margin ('interior points') have no influence on the boundary. You can add or move these points freely (as long as they don't cross the margin), and the solution will not change.\n")

    # Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.
    print("E. This statement is FALSE.")
    print("   This is a general mathematical statement that is not universally true without additional conditions. A simple counterexample is the function f(x) = e^x. This function is strictly convex (its second derivative e^x is always positive), but it has no global minimum. It approaches an infimum of 0 as x approaches -infinity, but it never reaches a minimum value. For a strictly convex function to be guaranteed a unique global minimizer, it needs additional properties, such as being defined on a compact domain or being coercive (f(x) -> infinity as ||x|| -> infinity).\n")

    print("---Conclusion---")
    print("Statements A, B, C, and D are true. Statement E is false.")
    print("The question asks which statement is NOT true.")
    print("Therefore, the correct answer is E.")
