# This is a medical reasoning problem, not a coding problem.
# The user wants me to identify the best next step in a surgical scenario.
# My plan is to explain the reasoning based on standard surgical principles and then identify the correct multiple-choice answer.

# Step 1: Analyze the situation.
# A laparoscopic stapler is stuck on the base of the appendix. Troubleshooting has failed.
# This is a critical equipment failure at a critical part of the operation.
# The primary goal is patient safety.

# Step 2: Evaluate the options.
# A. Resecting cecum: Too aggressive, creates a bigger problem. Bad choice.
# B. Prying laparoscopically: High risk of tearing tissue (cecum/appendix), leading to hemorrhage or contamination. Bad choice.
# C. Extend port and pry: Better access than B, but still risky. Prying a stuck stapler is unpredictable and can cause tissue damage. Not the safest option.
# D. Extend port and convert to open appendectomy: This is the safest and most standard approach. It's called "conversion to open surgery." It allows for direct vision, control of the tissues, and safe removal of the appendix and the broken instrument. This is the principle of "safety first."
# E. Midline incision and pry: Wrong incision location. A midline incision is for major central abdominal surgery, not an appendectomy in the right lower quadrant.
# F. Midline incision and open appendectomy: Wrong incision location.

# Step 3: Conclude the best option.
# Option D follows the fundamental surgical principle: if a minimally invasive procedure becomes unsafe or impossible, convert to an open procedure for maximum patient safety and control. The incision is made in the most logical and efficient location by extending an existing port.
best_choice = 'D'

print("The next best step is to convert the procedure to an open appendectomy.")
print("This is done by extending the incision from the stapler's port.")
print("This allows the surgeon to have direct vision and control, which is the safest way to handle the complication of the stuck instrument and complete the appendectomy.")
print("Therefore, the correct answer is D.")
