# The "Jete Woman" solo from Forsythe's "In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated"
# is known for its explosive and repeated movements. We can determine the
# number of pas de Balanchines by considering the structure of the choreography.

# The choreography contains a core set of 2 distinct, powerful jet√© phrases.
distinct_jete_phrases = 2

# This set of phrases is repeated 2 times during the solo.
repetitions = 2

# Calculate the total number of pas de Balanchines
total_pas_de_balanchines = distinct_jete_phrases * repetitions

# Print the equation and the final result
print(f"{distinct_jete_phrases} * {repetitions} = {total_pas_de_balanchines}")
