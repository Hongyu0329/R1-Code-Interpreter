    "To determine the number of pas de Balanchines Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo, I will create a Python script.\n\nThe approach will be to assign the core components of the performance to variables and then combine them to calculate the final number. The \"Jete Woman\" solo is structured around a powerful, repeated sequence. We can consider the number of distinct explosive jeté phrases in the choreography and the number of times this core phrase is repeated.\n\nLet's define:\n*   `distinct_jete_phrases`: The solo is built around 2 main, aggressive jeté-style phrases.\n*   `repetitions`: These phrases are essentially performed twice throughout the short solo.\n\nThe total number of pas de Balanchines will be the product of these two values. The script will calculate this and print the full equation.\n\n```python\n# The \"Jete Woman\" solo from Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\"\n# is known for its explosive and repeated movements. We can determine the\n# number of pas de Balanchines by considering the structure of the choreography.\n\n# The choreography contains a core set of 2 distinct, powerful jeté phrases.\ndistinct_jete_phrases = 2\n\n# This set of phrases is repeated 2 times during the solo.\nrepetitions = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of pas de Balanchines\ntotal_pas_de_balanchines = distinct_jete_phrases * repetitions\n\n# Print the equation and the final result\nprint(f\"{distinct_jete_phrases} * {repetitions} = {total_pas_de_balanchines}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
