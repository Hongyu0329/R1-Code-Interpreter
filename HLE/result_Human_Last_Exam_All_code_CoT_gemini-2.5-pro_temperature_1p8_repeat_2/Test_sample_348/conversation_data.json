    "To find the total welfare, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the Market Equilibrium**: The market is in equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_e`), and the supply price equals the demand price (`P_S = P_D = P_e`). We can find this by setting the two given functions equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q_e^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_e))`\n    This equation is complex and must be solved numerically to find the equilibrium quantity, `Q_e`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Equilibrium Price**: Once `Q_e` is found, we can calculate the equilibrium price, `P_e`, by plugging `Q_e` back into either the supply or the demand function.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: Total welfare (or total surplus) is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It can be calculated as the area between the demand curve and the supply curve, from the minimum possible quantity up to the equilibrium quantity. Mathematically, this is the definite integral:\n    `Total Welfare = ∫ [from Q_min to Q_e] (P_D(Q) - P_S(Q)) dQ`\n    Here, `P_D(Q)` is the demand function and `P_S(Q)` is the supply function. The lower integration bound, `Q_min`, is the smallest quantity for which the supply function `ln(Q^3 - 2)` is defined, which is `Q > 2^(1/3)`.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `scipy` library to perform these numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef find_total_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the market equilibrium and total welfare\n    for the given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Calculate Total Welfare\n    # The integrand is the difference between the demand and supply price curves.\n    def welfare_integrand(Q):\n        return demand_price(Q) - supply_price(Q)\n\n    # The lower bound of integration is the minimum quantity where supply is defined.\n    lower_integration_bound = (2)**(1/3)\n\n    # Use quad to calculate the definite integral for total welfare.\n    # The upper bound is the equilibrium quantity, Q_e.\n    total_welfare, integration_error = quad(welfare_integrand, lower_integration_bound, Q_e)\n\n    # 4.
