    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a specific conductor $d = 53599$ and order $g = 6$.\n\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be analyzed by decomposing it based on the prime factorization of the conductor $d$. First, I will find the prime factors of $d = 53599$.\n\n3.  **Primitivity Condition:** The conductor $d$ is square-free ($d = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot p_3 \\cdot p_4$). A character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free $d$ is primitive if and only if its component characters $\\chi_i$ (mod $p_i$) are all non-trivial. This means the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be greater than 1.\n\n4.  **Order Condition:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$. We need this to be equal to $g=6$.\n\n5.  **Counting Strategy:** I will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion (via the Möbius inversion formula) to count the number of characters that meet these conditions. The formula for the number of primitive characters of order $g$ for a square-free conductor $d = \\prod p_i$ is:\n    $N_g(d) = \\sum_{k|g} \\mu(g/k) \\prod_{p|d} (\\text{gcd}(k, p-1) - 1)$\n    where $\\mu$ is the Möbius function, the sum is over all divisors $k$ of $g$, and the product is over all prime factors $p$ of $d$.\n\n6.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will:\n    *   Factorize $d=53599$.\n    *   Find all divisors of $g=6$.\n    *   For each divisor $k$ of $g$, it will compute the corresponding term in the sum: $\\mu(g/k) \\times \\text{product}$.\n    *   It will display each step of the calculation, including the intermediate values for $\\mu$, gcd, and the product.\n    *   Finally, it will sum the terms to get the total count and display the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\n# Cache for Mobius function to avoid recomputing\nmu_cache = {}\ndef mobius_mu(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n in mu_cache:\n        return mu_cache[n]\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            mu_cache[n] = 0\n            return 0\n    result = (-1)**len(factors)\n    mu_cache[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given\n    conductor d and order g.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Let d = {d} and g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d and order g.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Find the prime factorization of d.\")\n    factors_d = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes_d = sorted(list(factors_d.keys()))\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d is: { ' * '.join(map(str, primes_d)) }.\")\n\n    is_square_free = all(v == 1 for v in factors_d.values())\n    if not is_square_free:\n        print(\"d is not square-free.
