def get_automorphism_group_counts():

    Provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups for
    compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g = 2, 3, and 4.

    These values are established results from the mathematical classification of
    finite group actions on surfaces. They are not computed here but are retrieved
    from known literature. A reliable public source for these numbers is the
    On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), sequence A000943.
