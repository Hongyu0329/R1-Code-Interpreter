# The problem asks for the specific chromosomal event, not a calculation.
# The following code simply restates the logical conclusion for clarity.

# Define the parental cross implied by the exceptional offspring.
# The X0 male has red eyes (w+) and miniature wings (m). His genotype is X(w+m)O.
# He must have inherited his X from his father and the 'O' (no sex chromosome) from his mother.
father_genotype = "X(w+m)Y"
mother_genotype = "X(?)X(?)" # Mother's genotype is not specified but she is the source of the error.

# Analyze the formation of the exceptional male offspring.
offspring_genotype = "X(w+m)O"
paternal_gamete = "X(w+m) sperm"
maternal_gamete = "O-egg (an egg with no X chromosome)"

# Identify the meiotic error that produces the maternal gamete.
# An O-egg is produced when a female's X chromosomes fail to segregate into the egg.
# This failure of homologous chromosomes to separate occurs during Meiosis I.
meiotic_event = "Non-disjunction of the X chromosome in female meiosis I"
explanation = f"To produce an {offspring_genotype} male, a normal {paternal_gamete} from the father must fertilize an {maternal_gamete} from the mother."
conclusion = f"The production of an {maternal_gamete} results from {meiotic_event}."
