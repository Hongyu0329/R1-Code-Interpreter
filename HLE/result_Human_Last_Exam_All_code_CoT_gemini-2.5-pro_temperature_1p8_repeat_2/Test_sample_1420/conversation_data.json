    "To calculate the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a d=3 system, we will use the epsilon expansion method. This method performs a perturbative expansion around the upper critical dimension, `d_c = 4`.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define Key Parameters**: We need the spatial dimension `d`, the upper critical dimension `d_c`, and `n`, the number of components of the order parameter. For the standard Ising model universality class, `n=1`.\n2.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ)**: The expansion parameter is `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **Apply the Formula**: The specific heat exponent `α` is given to the first order in `ϵ` by the formula for the n-component vector model: `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`.\n4.  **Execute and Print**: A Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step of the formula, along with the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α using the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define key parameters\n    # The spatial dimension of the system.\n    d = 3\n    # The upper critical dimension for this universality class (O(n) models) is 4.\n    d_c = 4\n    # The problem doesn't specify the model, so we assume the most common case,\n    # the Ising universality class, where the order parameter is a scalar (n=1).\n    n = 1\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate epsilon (ϵ)\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the first-order epsilon expansion formula for α\n    # The formula is α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\n    # We use SymPy to represent the result as an exact fraction initially.\n    alpha_frac = sympy.Rational(4 - n, 2 * (n + 8)) * epsilon\n    alpha_float = float(alpha_frac)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the process and the result\n    print(\"Calculation of the specific heat exponent α for d=3 using the ϵ-expansion:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Spatial dimension, d = {d}\")\n    print(f\"Upper critical dimension, d_c = {d_c}\")\n    print(f\"Order parameter components, n = {n} (for the Ising universality class)\")\n    print(f\"Epsilon, ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe first-order ϵ-expansion formula for α is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\")\n    # The final code prints each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {4-n} / (2 * {n+8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {4-n} / {2*(n+8)}\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha_frac} ≈ {alpha_float:.4f}\")\n    \ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
