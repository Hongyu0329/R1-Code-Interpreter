    Analyzes which of the given sets are necessarily "closepact".

    The problem defines "closepact" for a space X as follows: any cover of X
    consisting of closures of open sets in X has a finite subcover.

    For Hausdorff spaces (like all subsets of R or C), this property is
    equivalent to compactness.

    A subset of R or C is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
    This code analyzes each option based on this criterion.
