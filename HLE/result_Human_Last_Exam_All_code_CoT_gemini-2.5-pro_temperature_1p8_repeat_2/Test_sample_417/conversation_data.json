    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure and Symmetry:** I will first examine the full chemical name to understand the molecule's structure. The key is to identify the central core, the substituents, and any symmetry elements. The name `1,3,5-tri[...]` and `2,4,6-trimethylbenzene` suggests a high degree of symmetry (a C3 rotational axis).\n2.  **Apply Symmetry to Simplify the Problem:** Due to the C3 symmetry, the three large substituents attached to the benzene ring are chemically equivalent. This means we only need to count the unique proton environments in the central core and within a single substituent group.\n3.  **Count Peaks for Each Unique Part:** I will break the molecule down and count the expected signals for each part:\n    *   **The central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core:** Determine the number of unique proton signals from the methyl groups on this ring.\n    *   **The `-CH2-` linkers:** Determine if the protons on the methylene linkers are equivalent. I will consider the effect of the attached chiral substituent, which will make these protons diastereotopic.\n    *   **A single substituent:** I will analyze the complex chiral substituent `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` to count all of its unique proton environments, again paying close attention to diastereotopicity for `CH2` and gem-dimethyl (`C(CH3)2`) groups.\n4.  **Sum the Peaks:** I will add the number of peaks from each unique part to get the total number of expected signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that codifies this step-by-step analysis, explains the reasoning, and prints the final calculation clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the structure of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    to determine the expected number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 1H NMR peaks:\")\n    print(\"The number of peaks in a 1H NMR spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent proton environments in a molecule.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"1.
