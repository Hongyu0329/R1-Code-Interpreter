    This script evaluates different insect behavioral patterns to determine which
    has the greatest positive effect on plant fitness, based on pollination effectiveness.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Plant fitness from insects is mainly through pollination.
    2. Pollination requires contact with the flower's reproductive parts.
    3. 'Feeding' (5-6) is the most effective behavior for pollination because it
       involves deep and prolonged contact. 'Interaction' (3-4) that is not
       feeding is less effective. 'Investigation' (1-2) has no effect.
    4. We can model this by assigning fitness "points" per second to each behavior.
       Let's assign a high weight to feeding and a lower weight to other interactions.
