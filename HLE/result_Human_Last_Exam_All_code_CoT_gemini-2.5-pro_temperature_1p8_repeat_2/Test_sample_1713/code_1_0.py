# A script to calculate a firm's profit/loss based on geometric areas

# 1. Define variables based on the problem's conditions: P < AVC < ATC
# Let's assume some example values
q1 = 50  # Output quantity
P = 10   # Market Price
AVC = 15 # Average Variable Cost
ATC = 20 # Average Total Cost

print(f"Let's assume the following values which satisfy the condition P < AVC < ATC:")
print(f"Output Quantity (q1) = {q1}")
print(f"Market Price (P) = ${P}")
print(f"Average Variable Cost (AVC) = ${AVC}")
print(f"Average Total Cost (ATC) = ${ATC}")
print("-" * 40)

# 2. Calculate the areas S and H
# Area S represents Total Revenue (TR = P * q1)
S = P * q1

# Area H represents Total Cost (TC = ATC * q1)
H = ATC * q1

print("First, we calculate the area S, representing Total Revenue (TR).")
print(f"S = P * q1")
print(f"S = {P} * {q1} = {S}")
print("\nNext, we calculate the area H, representing Total Cost (TC).")
print(f"H = ATC * q1")
print(f"H = {ATC} * {q1} = {H}")
print("-" * 40)

# 3. Calculate the profit/loss
# Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
profit = S - H

print("The firm's profit or loss is the difference between Total Revenue and Total Cost.")
print("Profit = TR - TC")
print("In terms of the defined areas, the formula is: Profit = S - H")
print("\nUsing our example values, the calculation is:")
print(f"Profit = {S} - {H} = {profit}")
print("\nSince the result is negative, the firm is experiencing a loss of ${abs(profit)}.")
print(f"The area that represents the firm's profit is S - H.")
