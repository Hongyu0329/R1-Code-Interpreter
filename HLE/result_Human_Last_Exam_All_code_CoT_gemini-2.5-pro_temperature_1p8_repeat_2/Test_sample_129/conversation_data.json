    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid boolean expression strings of a specific length. This is a classic dynamic programming problem that can be solved by defining a grammar that captures the structure of the expressions, including operator precedence and associativity.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define a Formal Grammar:** We'll define a grammar that models the structure of boolean expressions, respecting the given operator precedence (`! > & > |`). Let's assume left-associativity for `&` and `|`, which is standard.\n    *   `E` (Expression): A series of one or more `T`s separated by `|`. Example: `T | T | F`.\n    *   `T` (Term): A series of one or more `F`s separated by `&`. Example: `F & A & B`.\n    *   `F` (Factor): A literal (`A`) potentially prefixed by one or more negations (`!`). Example: `!!A`.\n    *   `A` (Atom): A literal (`T` or `F`) or a parenthesized expression `(E)`.\n\n    The grammar rules are:\n    *   `E -> E | T` or `E -> T`\n    *   `T -> T & F` or `T -> F`\n    *   `F -> !F` or `F -> A`\n    *   `A -> T` or `A -> F` or `A -> (E)`\n\n2.  **Set up Dynamic Programming:** We will use four arrays, `E(n)`, `T(n)`, `F(n)`, and `A(n)`, to store the number of valid Expressions, Terms, Factors, and Atoms of length `n`.\n\n3.  **Formulate Recurrence Relations:** Based on the grammar, we can establish relations to compute the values for length `n` from values for smaller lengths.\n    *   `A(n)`: Count of atoms of length `n`. This is 2 for `n=1` (`T`, `F`) and `E(n-2)` for `n>1` (from `(E)`).\n    *   `F(n)`: Count of factors of length `n`. An `F` is an `A` or `!F`, so `F(n) = A(n) + F(n-1)`.\n    *   `T(n)`: Count of terms of length `n`. A `T` is an `F` or `T & F`, so `T(n) = F(n) + Σ(T(k) * F(n-1-k))` for `k` from 1 to `n-2`.\n    *   `E(n)`: Count of expressions of length `n`. An `E` is a `T` or `E | T`, so `E(n) = T(n) + Σ(E(k) * T(n-1-k))` for `k` from 1 to `n-2`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to compute these values iteratively from `n=1` to `5`. The script will print the final calculation steps for the result as requested. The final answer is `E(5)`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5 using dynamic programming.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Maximum length of the expression to consider\n    max_len = 5\n\n    # DP tables to store the counts for expressions (E), terms (T), factors (F), and atoms (A)\n    E = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    T = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    F = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    A = collections.defaultdict(int)\n\n    # Base case: n = 1\n    # Atoms of length 1 are 'T' and 'F'\n    A[1] = 2\n    # A Factor can be an Atom, a Term can be a Factor, an Expression can be a Term.\n    F[1] = A[1]\n    T[1] = F[1]\n    E[1] = T[1]\n\n    # Iteratively fill DP tables from n = 2 to max_len\n    for n in range(2, max_len + 1):\n        # A(n) -> (E) where E is an expression of length n-2\n        A[n] = E[n - 2]\n        \n        # F(n) -> !F (Factor of length n-1) or A(n) (Atom of length n)\n        F[n] = F[n - 1] + A[n]\n        \n        # T(n) -> F(n) | T(k) & F(n-1-k)\n        # Sum over all possible splits for the binary operator '&'\n        t_sum = 0\n        for k in range(1, n - 1):\n            t_sum += T[k] * F[n - 1 - k]\n        T[n] = F[n] + t_sum\n\n        # E(n) -> T(n) | E(k) | T(n-1-k)\n        # Sum over all possible splits for the binary operator '|'\n        e_sum = 0\n        for k in range(1, n - 1):\n            e_sum += E[k] * T[n - 1 - k]\n        E[n] = T[n] + e_sum\n\n    # The final answer is E[5].
