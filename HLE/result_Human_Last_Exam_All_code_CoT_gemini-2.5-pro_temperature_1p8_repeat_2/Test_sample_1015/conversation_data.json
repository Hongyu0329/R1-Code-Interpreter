    "To answer this question, I will analyze the stylistic and technical differences between the Vaganova (Russian) and Balanchine (American) ballet methods, specifically concerning the execution of a *cambré derrière* (a bend of the upper body to the back). My analysis will focus on how each school teaches the movement from the ground up, paying close attention to the core, hips, and upper body.\n\nI will write a Python script that defines the question and options, and then programmatically selects and prints the correct answer with a detailed explanation of the reasoning. This fulfills the request to use code to solve the task.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and answers a multiple-choice question about ballet technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_key = 'B'\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the technique emphasizes keeping the hips square and level, \"\n        \"directly over the supporting foot.
