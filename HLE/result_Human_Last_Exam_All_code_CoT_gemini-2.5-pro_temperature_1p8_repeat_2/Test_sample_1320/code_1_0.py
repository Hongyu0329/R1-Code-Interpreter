# Plan: To find the helix type for an alternating alpha/epsilon-amino acid foldamer.
# 1. Start with the known helix size for a related, well-studied foldamer: the alpha/gamma peptide.
# 2. The alpha/gamma foldamer forms a 14-helix, meaning its hydrogen-bonded ring has 14 atoms.
m_alpha_gamma = 14
num_carbons_gamma = 3 # In the linear chain of the gamma-amino acid backbone, e.g., in -NH-(CH2)3-CO-

# 3. An epsilon-amino acid has a longer backbone than a gamma-amino acid.
num_carbons_epsilon = 5 # In the linear chain of the epsilon-amino acid backbone, e.g., in -NH-(CH2)5-CO-

# 4. The change in the number of backbone atoms directly impacts the hydrogen-bond ring size.
#    The H-bond pattern is i -> i+3, so one non-alpha residue is inside the loop.
atom_difference = num_carbons_epsilon - num_carbons_gamma

# 5. Calculate the expected ring size for the alpha/epsilon helix.
m_alpha_epsilon = m_alpha_gamma + atom_difference

print(f"Step 4: The increase in atoms within the hydrogen-bond ring is {atom_difference}.")
print("Step 5: The final calculated ring size for an alpha/epsilon-peptide helix is:")

print("The notation '14/16' in the answer choices describes the family of helices formed by alpha/gamma (14) and alpha/epsilon (16) peptides.")
print("Thus, the most likely helix type is the 14/16-helix.")
