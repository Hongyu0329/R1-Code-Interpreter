# The riddle describes a man with "porcupine-like" hair
# and a name with two words starting with the same letter.
# The reference to Kurt Vonnegut is a misdirection, as the person
# he described (Bob Dylan) does not have an alliterative name.
#
# The correct answer is a famous tennis player from the 1980s
# who was well-known for his spiky blonde hair.

# Define the first and last name
first_name = "Boris"
last_name = "Becker"

# Print the full name to answer the riddle
print(f"The name of the man who fits the description is: {first_name} {last_name}")
