    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, we need to correctly interpret the question. The question asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any such graph $G$.\n2.  Let $n$ be the number of vertices, so $n = 12345$.\n3.  A complete graph $K_n$ is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The chromatic number of $K_n$ is $n$, because all vertices are adjacent to each other and thus require a unique color.\n4.  The problem states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means there is at least one pair of vertices in $G$ that are not connected by an edge.\n5.  We can establish an upper bound for $\\chi(G)$. Let $u$ and $v$ be two vertices that are not adjacent. We can assign the same color to both $u$ and $v$. For the remaining $n-2$ vertices, we can assign each of them a new, unique color. In the worst-case scenario (where all other $n-2$ vertices are connected to each other and to both $u$ and $v$), this coloring strategy would be proper. This strategy uses $1$ color for $\\{u, v\\}$ and $n-2$ colors for the other vertices, for a total of $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. Therefore, for any non-complete graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n6.  Next, we need to check if this upper bound of $n-1$ can actually be achieved. We can construct a graph that demonstrates this. Consider the graph $G^*$ created by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding one more vertex, $v$, which is not connected to any of the other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n    *   This graph $G^*$ has $n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the vertex $v$ is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   The subgraph $K_{n-1}$ requires $n-1$ colors. The vertex $v$ can be colored with one of those colors, but the minimum number of colors for the entire graph is determined by its most color-demanding component, which is $K_{n-1}$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G^*) = n-1$.\n7.  Since we've shown that $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$ for any such graph and that there exists a graph for which $\\chi(G) = n-1$, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n8.  For our specific problem, $n=12345$. So the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this simple calculation and print out the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph G\nnum_vertices = 12345\n\n# According to graph theory, the maximum chromatic number for a graph with n vertices\n# that is not a complete graph is n-1.\n# A complete graph Kn requires n colors. Any graph other than Kn is missing at least\n# one edge. Let u and v be two vertices that are not connected. We can assign the\n# same color to u and v. All other n-2 vertices can be assigned their own unique\n# colors. This gives a valid coloring with at most 1 + (n-2) = n-1 colors.\n# This maximum is achievable, for example, by a graph consisting of a complete graph\n# on n-1 vertices (K_{n-1}) and one isolated vertex. Such a graph requires n-1 colors.\n\nmax_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n# Print the equation showing the calculation.\nprint(f\"The maximum number of colours required is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
