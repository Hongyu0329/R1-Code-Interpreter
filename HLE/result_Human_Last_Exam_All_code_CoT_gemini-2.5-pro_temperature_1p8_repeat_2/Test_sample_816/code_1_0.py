    print("The flow of liquid metal in a weld pool is driven by several forces. The direction of flow on the surface is primarily determined by the Marangoni force.")
    print("\n1. The Marangoni force arises from a gradient (or difference) in surface tension across the surface of the molten pool.")
    print("2. Surface tension is a function of temperature. In most pure metals, surface tension decreases as temperature increases. This would cause an outward flow from the hot center to the cooler edge.")
    print("3. However, 304 stainless steel contains trace elements like sulfur, which are 'surface active agents' or surfactants.")
    print("4. In the presence of these surfactants, the temperature coefficient of surface tension becomes positive. This means surface tension is highest at the hottest point (the center) and lower at the cooler edges.")
    print("5. This gradient creates a force that pulls the surface fluid from the low-tension edges inwards to the high-tension center, perfectly matching the observation.")
    print("\nWhile other forces like Lorentz and Arc Drag are present, the characteristic inward surface flow is the classic signature of surfactant-driven Marangoni convection.")
