    "This is a knowledge-based question that can be answered by looking up the common name for the chemical provided. The chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` is more commonly known as **Rhodamine B**. This fluorescent pink dye is famously used in an unexpected Crayola crayon color.\n\nI will write a Python script that stores this information and prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Crayola crayon color that contains a specific chemical.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical in question is commonly known as Rhodamine B.\n    chemical_data = {\n        \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\": {\n            \"common_name\": \"Rhodamine B\",\n            \"crayon_color\": \"Screamin' Green\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    query_chemical = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n    if query_chemical in chemical_data:\n        info = chemical_data[query_chemical]\n        color = info[\"crayon_color\"]\n        common_name = info[\"common_name\"]\n\n        print(f\"The chemical provided is: {query_chemical}\")\n        print(f\"Its common name is: {common_name}\")\n        print(f\"\\nThis pigment is used to create the Crayola crayon color: {color}\")\n        print(\"\\nInterestingly, this pink fluorescent dye is mixed with a yellow pigment to produce a color that appears green in normal light but fluoresces orange-red under UV light.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Crayon color not found for the specified chemical.\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Screamin' Green>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
