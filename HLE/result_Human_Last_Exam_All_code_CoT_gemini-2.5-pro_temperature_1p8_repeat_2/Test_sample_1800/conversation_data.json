    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe question of the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalysis is a scientific one, determined through extensive experimental research rather than a straightforward calculation. The optimal ratio represents a trade-off between having enough active Nickel (Ni) sites for the reaction and maintaining catalyst stability by preventing Ni particles from clumping together (sintering) at high temperatures. The Ceria (CeOâ‚‚) support plays a crucial role in dispersing the Ni and participating in the reaction mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the Python code below will not *calculate* this value from first principles but will rather present the consensus found in scientific literature, framing it within a calculation format as requested. The code calculates the molar ratio based on an optimal atomic percentage commonly cited in research papers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Summarizes findings from scientific literature on the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for\n    WGS and water splitting reactions.\n\n    This is not a theoretical calculation but a representation of experimental results.\n    The ideal ratio maximizes catalytic activity while ensuring long-term stability.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing scientific literature to determine the ideal Ni/Ce ratio...\")\n    print(\"The optimal ratio depends on maximizing the synergy between Ni and the Ceria support.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Scientific consensus points to a low atomic percentage of Ni being optimal.\n    # This enhances the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and prevents Ni sintering.\n    # A frequently cited optimal atomic percentage of Ni is around 10%.\n    optimal_ni_atomic_percent = 10\n\n    # The remaining percentage is Cerium.\n    ce_atomic_percent = 100 - optimal_ni_atomic_percent\n\n    print(f\"A commonly reported optimal atomic percentage of Ni is {optimal_ni_atomic_percent}%.\")\n    print(f\"This implies a Cerium atomic percentage of {ce_atomic_percent}%.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the molar ratio (Ni/Ce) based on these percentages:\")\n\n    # The ratio is Ni % / Ce %\n    # Using integer values for the final simplified fraction\n    numerator_unsimplified = optimal_ni_atomic_percent\n    denominator_unsimplified = ce_atomic_percent\n\n    # To get the final equation, we simplify the fraction.\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(numerator_unsimplified, denominator_unsimplified)\n    final_numerator = numerator_unsimplified // common_divisor\n    final_denominator = denominator_unsimplified // common_divisor\n    \n    decimal_value = final_numerator / final_denominator\n\n    print(f\"The unsimplified ratio is {numerator_unsimplified} / {denominator_unsimplified}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final, simplified equation for the ideal molar ratio is:\")\n    print(f\">>> {final_numerator} / {final_denominator} <<<\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis ratio, approximately {decimal_value:.3f}, is often ideal because it provides a high dispersion of Ni atoms on the Ceria support, which is critical for both Water Gas Shift and water splitting reactions.\")\n\nfind_ideal_ni_ce_ratio()\n```\n<<<1/9>>>"
