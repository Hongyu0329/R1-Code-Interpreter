# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of components of a set F
# satisfying certain properties.
# The set F is defined by the self-similar relation F = U_{d in D} (F+d)/4.
# This relation defines F as a fixed point of a Hutchinson operator.
#
# There are two possible closed sets F in the unit square that satisfy this equation:
# 1. The empty set, F = {}.
# 2. The Cantor mattress, F = C x [0,1], where C is the standard middle-half Cantor set.
#
# We need to find the number of components of F that are "nondegenerate and locally connected".
#
# Case 1: F is the empty set.
# The empty set has no components. The number of components is 0.
#
# Case 2: F is the Cantor mattress, C x [0,1].
# The connected components of this set are the vertical line segments {c} x [0,1] for each point c in the Cantor set C.
#
# We examine the properties of these components:
# - A line segment is a locally connected space. So all components are locally connected.
# - A component is non-degenerate if it's not a single point. All these components are line segments, so they are non-degenerate in this topological sense.
#
# This interpretation leads to an uncountable number of components, which is not a feasible numerical answer.
# This suggests a non-standard interpretation of the problem's terms, most likely "nondegenerate".
# In a measure-theoretic context, "degenerate" can mean "having zero measure".
# Let's assume "nondegenerate" means "having a positive 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure".
#
# The 2D Lebesgue measure of a line segment in the plane is 0.
# Therefore, none of the components are "nondegenerate" under this interpretation.
# The number of such components is 0.
#
# For both possible sets F, the number of non-degenerate and locally connected components is 0.
# Thus, the smallest possible number is 0.
