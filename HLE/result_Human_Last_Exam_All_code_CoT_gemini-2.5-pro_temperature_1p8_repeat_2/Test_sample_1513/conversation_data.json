    "I will identify the island town based on the provided geographical clues and then create a Python script to demonstrate one of the key numerical facts about it.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Analyze the clues:\n    *   **Extremely remote:** \"> 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\". This points to one of the most isolated places on Earth.\n    *   **Volcanic setting:** \"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera\". This implies the bay itself is a drowned crater or heavily shaped by one.\n    *   **Shared name:** The town and the bay/caldera share a name.\n2.  Evaluate potential candidates:\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** The most remote inhabited island, but its capital, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, does not sit in a caldera bay of the same name.\n    *   **Pago Pago, American Samoa:** Sits in Pago Pago Harbor, which is a volcanic caldera. However, it fails the remoteness test as the inhabited island of Upolu (Samoa) is only about 130 km away.\n    *   **Hanga Roa, Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This is the strongest candidate.\n        *   It is extremely remote, with its nearest inhabited neighbor, Pitcairn Island, being over 2,000 km away. This easily surpasses the 500 km requirement.\n        *   The town is named Hanga Roa and it sits on Hanga Roa Bay.\n        *   While the bay itself isn't a classic, perfectly round caldera, the island is entirely volcanic and the bay's geography is defined by lava flows from the island's volcanoes, including the nearby major caldera of Rano Kau. For a trivia question, this is the most likely intended answer.\n3.  Create a Python script to verify the remoteness claim. The script will define the distance to the nearest inhabited island and the threshold mentioned in the question, then perform a calculation to show how much it exceeds the threshold.\n\n```python\n# The island town that fits the description is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\ntown_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\nisland_name = \"Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\"\n\n# One of the key clues is its extreme remoteness.\n# The nearest inhabited island is Pitcairn Island.\ndistance_to_nearest_inhabited_island_km = 2075\n\n# The question states a threshold of 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\nremoteness_threshold_km = 500\n\n# We can calculate how much this distance exceeds the threshold.\nexceeds_by_km = distance_to_nearest_inhabited_island_km - remoteness_threshold_km\n\n# Let's print the information and the calculation.\nprint(f\"The town is {town_name} on {island_name}.\")\nprint(f\"It sits on Hanga Roa bay, which shares the town's name.\")\nprint(f\"The island is volcanic, famous for its calderas like Rano Kau.\")\nprint(\"\\nVerifying the remoteness:\")\nprint(f\"The distance to the nearest inhabited island is {distance_to_nearest_inhabited_island_km} km.\")\nprint(f\"The required remoteness threshold is {remoteness_threshold_km} km.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe town's remoteness exceeds the threshold by a large margin.\")\nprint(\"Here is the equation demonstrating this:\")\nprint(f\"{distance_to_nearest_inhabited_island_km} - {remoteness_threshold_km} = {exceeds_by_km} km\")\n\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
