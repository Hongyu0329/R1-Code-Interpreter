    "The task is to provide the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism. This is a foundational concept in quantum field theory at finite temperature.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Core Formula:** The partition function `Z` in this formalism is a functional integral over anticommuting fields, weighted by the exponential of the Euclidean action.\n2.  **Define Key Components:** I will define each part of the formula:\n    *   The integral measure, which involves Grassmann variables (`ψ` and `ψ_bar`) suitable for describing fermions.\n    *   The Euclidean action `S_E`, which is derived from the standard Lagrangian via an imaginary time substitution (Wick rotation).\n    *   The crucial boundary conditions. For fermions, these are *anti-periodic* in the imaginary time direction, a direct consequence of the trace operation and fermion statistics.\n3.  **Construct Python Code:** I will use a Python script to print out the complete formula and then explain each symbolic component, fulfilling the request to \"output each number in the final equation\" by breaking down the formula into its constituent parts.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism and explains its components.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- The Full Formula ---\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:\\n\")\n    \n    formula_z = \"Z\"\n    formula_eq = \"=\"\n    formula_integral = \"∫_A.P.B.C.\"\n    formula_measure = \"Dψ_bar Dψ\"\n    formula_exp = \"exp(-S_E[ψ_bar, ψ])\"\n    \n    print(f\"{formula_z} {formula_eq} {formula_integral} {formula_measure} {formula_exp}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Components of the Formula ---\\n\")\n    \n    # --- 1.
