# Description of the Task:
# The goal is to identify the "True Avalanche" for the description:
# "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
# A True Avalanche repeats a syllable pattern. The key word is "computer".

# Step 1: Analyze the syllable pattern of "computer".
# The word "computer" is phonetically broken down into "com-pu-ter".

# Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices to see which one repeats this pattern
# and matches the description.

# The description involves a computer giving a command to a bird about relieving itself.

# Let's look at Choice B: Computer: "Come poo, tern!"

# Step 3: Check if Choice B is a True Avalanche.
# The phrase "Come poo, tern" can be syllabically read as "come-poo-tern".
# This is a very close phonetic match to "com-pu-ter".
# The first word "Computer" establishes the pattern, and "Come poo, tern!" repeats it.
# This meets the criteria for a True Avalanche.

# Step 4: Check if Choice B matches the description.
# The phrase depicts a computer giving a command ("Come poo") to a bird (a "tern").
# This perfectly fits the description "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

# Step 5: Final Conclusion.
# Choice B is the only option that is both a True Avalanche based on the word "computer"
# and also a perfect match for the provided description.
