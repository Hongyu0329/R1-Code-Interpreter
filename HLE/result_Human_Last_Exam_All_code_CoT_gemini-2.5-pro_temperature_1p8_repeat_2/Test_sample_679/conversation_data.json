    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the identification of the unknown hydrocarbon, presented in a clear Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will first use the given molecular formula, $C_7H_{14}$, to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE). This will tell us if the molecule contains double bonds or rings.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**: I'll examine each signal's chemical shift (position) and multiplicity (s, t, d, q) to identify the types of carbon atoms present (e.g., C, CH, CH2, CH3) and their chemical environment (alkene or alkane).\n3.  **Account for All Atoms**: I will notice that there are 6 NMR signals but 7 carbons in the formula. Following the hint, this means one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons. I'll deduce which signal this is and create a complete list of carbon fragments.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**: I will piece together the identified carbon fragments to form a valid chemical structure that is consistent with all the data.\n5.  **Verify and Name the Structure**: Finally, I will verify that the proposed structure's predicted spectrum matches the given data perfectly and determine its official IUPAC name.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hydrocarbon_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine\n    the IUPAC name of the unknown hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_data = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't',\n        27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Task: Determine the IUPAC name for a hydrocarbon from its spectral data. ---\\n\")\n    print(f\"Given Molecular Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n    print(f\"Given 13C NMR Shifts (ppm) and Multiplicities: {nmr_data}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula to find Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"For a saturated acyclic alkane with 7 carbons, the formula would be C7H(2*7 + 2) = C7H16.\")\n    print(f\"The given formula {molecular_formula} has two fewer hydrogens than the saturated equivalent.\")\n    print(\"The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\")\n    print(\"A DBE of 1 indicates the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Spectrum\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the 13C NMR Spectrum\")\n    print(\"The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm).
