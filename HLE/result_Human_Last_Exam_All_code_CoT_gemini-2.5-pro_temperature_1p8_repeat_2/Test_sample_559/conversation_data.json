    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Separatrices are often invariant manifolds, meaning any trajectory that starts on the curve stays on it for all time. They frequently connect equilibrium points, especially saddle points.\n2.  I will look for a simple analytical solution that represents such an invariant manifold. Based on the polynomial nature of the given equations, a good hypothesis is a power-law relationship between `d` and `u`, specifically of the form `d(t) = c * u(t)^2`, where `c` is a constant to be determined.\n3.  I will substitute this hypothesis into the original system of differential equations. If `d = c * u^2` is indeed a solution curve, it must satisfy the system's equations for any valid trajectory `u(t)`.\n4.  This substitution will lead to a polynomial equation in `u`. For this equation to hold true for all values of `u` along a trajectory, the coefficients of each power of `u` must be zero.\n5.  By solving for `c` from the resulting coefficient equations, I can determine the precise form of the separatrix. The following Python code implements this symbolic calculation using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the separatrix for the given system of ODEs by hypothesizing\n    a polynomial relationship between d and u and solving for its coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define u and c as symbolic variables\n    u, c = sp.symbols('u c')\n\n    # The given system of differential equations is:\n    # d'(t) = 2*d(t)^2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)^2)*d(t) - u(t)^3*(1-u(t))\n    # u'(t) = u(t)^2 * (u(t) - 1)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Formulate a hypothesis for the separatrix.\")\n    print(\"We are looking for a special solution (an invariant manifold) to the system.\")\n    print(\"Let's hypothesize a solution of the form: d = c * u**2.\")\n    d_hypothesis = c * u**2\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Substitute the hypothesis into the system of equations.\")\n    print(\"First, express d'(t) in terms of u(t) and u'(t) using the chain rule:\")\n    # d/dt = (d(d)/du) * (du/dt) = (2*c*u) * u_prime\n    # We substitute the given expression for u'(t) = u^2 * (u - 1)\n    u_prime_expr = u**2 * (u - 1)\n    d_prime_from_hypothesis = (2 * c * u) * u_prime_expr\n    print(f\"d'(t) = 2*c*u * u'(t) = 2*c*u * ({sp.simplify(u_prime_expr)}) = {sp.simplify(d_prime_from_hypothesis)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nNext, substitute d = c * u**2 into the right-hand side (RHS) of the first ODE:\")\n    rhs_ode = 2 * d_hypothesis**2 + (-3 * u + 5 * u**2) * d_hypothesis - u**3 * (1 - u)\n    print(f\"RHS = {sp.simplify(rhs_ode)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Equate the two expressions and solve for the constant c.\")\n    # For d = c*u**2 to be a solution, d'(t) must equal the RHS for all u.\n    # So, d_prime_from_hypothesis - rhs_ode = 0.\n    equation = sp.simplify(d_prime_from_hypothesis - rhs_ode)\n    print(\"The equation (d'(t) - RHS) = 0 simplifies to:\")\n    print(f\"{equation} = 0\")\n    \n    # This polynomial in u must be zero for all u.
