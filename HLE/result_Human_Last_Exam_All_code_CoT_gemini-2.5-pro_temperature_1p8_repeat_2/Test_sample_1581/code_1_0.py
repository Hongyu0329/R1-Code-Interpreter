    # Step 1: The condition is equivalent to the configuration space of 2 points, F_2(X), being disconnected.
    # Step 2: A theorem by Borsuk states that for a "well-behaved" space X (a Peano continuum),
    # F_2(X) is disconnected if and only if X is an arc (homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1]).
    # We make the standard assumption that X is such a space to ensure a well-posed problem.
    # Step 3: All arcs are, by definition, in the same homeomorphism class.
    
    # Conclusion: There is only one such class.
