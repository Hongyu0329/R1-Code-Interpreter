    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question. First, I need to understand the music theory behind the question. The request is for a Beatles song that moves from the tonic chord (the first chord, or 'I', of the key) to the minor fifth chord (a minor chord built on the 5th degree of the scale, or 'v'). This progression is somewhat uncommon but very distinctive. I will identify the song that uses this progression at its beginning and then create a Python script to print the song's title as the answer.\n\nThe song that fits this description is \"Because\" from the album *Abbey Road*. The song is in the key of C# minor.\n- The **Tonic** chord is C# minor (i).\n- The fifth degree of the scale is G#. The song uses a G# **minor** chord (v), not the more common G# major dominant chord.\nThe song's famous intro is a C# minor arpeggio, and the first main chord change in the verse is from C# minor to G# minor.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific chord progression.\n\n    The question asks for a song starting with a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n    - Tonic: The root chord of the key (e.g., C major in the key of C).\n    - Minor fifth: A minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n\n    The song is \"Because\" from the Abbey Road album.\n    - Key: C# minor.\n    - Tonic (i): C# minor.\n    - Minor fifth (v): G# minor.\n\n    The song opens with an arpeggiated C# minor chord, and the first vocal phrase moves from\n    the C# minor tonic to the G# minor fifth chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Because\"\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a progression from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is: {song_title}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Because>>>"
