    """
    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific chord progression.

    - Tonic: The root chord of the key (e.g., C major in the key of C).
    - Minor fifth: A minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale.

    The song is "Because" from the Abbey Road album.
    - Key: C# minor.
    - Tonic (i): C# minor.
    - Minor fifth (v): G# minor.

    The song opens with an arpeggiated C# minor chord, and the first vocal phrase moves from
    the C# minor tonic to the G# minor fifth chord.
