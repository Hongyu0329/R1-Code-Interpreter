    "This problem requires finding the values of the parameter λ for which a given integral equation has no solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Equation:** The equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, which can be expressed as a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`.\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n\n2.  **Reduce to Linear System:** Because the kernel is degenerate, the integral equation can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations. We assume the solution `u(x)` is a polynomial of degree `n-1`, `u(x) = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j`. Substituting this into the equation and equating coefficients of powers of `x` yields a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `a_j`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Matrix Equation:** This linear system can be written in the matrix form:\n    `(I - λA)a = b`\n    where `a` is the vector of coefficients `[a_0, ..., a_{n-1}]ᵀ`, `b` is a constant vector `[1, 0, ..., 0]ᵀ` resulting from the `f(x)=1` term, `I` is the identity matrix, and `A` is an `n x n` matrix derived from the kernel. Specifically, `A = PH`, where `P` is the anti-identity matrix and `H` is the `n x n` Hilbert matrix `H_{ij} = 1/(i+j+1)`.\n\n4.  **Condition for No Solution:** According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system has no solution if the matrix `(I - λA)` is singular, i.e., its determinant is zero, and the vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`.\n    - The determinant is zero when `det(I - λA) = 0`. This implies that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n    - For this specific problem, it can be shown that if `det(I - λA) = 0`, the vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`.\n    - Therefore, the values of `λ` for which no solution exists are precisely the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A = PH`.\n\n5.  **Implementation:** The plan is to use Python to:\n    a. Construct the matrix `A = PH` for a given integer `n`.\n    b. Find the characteristic polynomial of `A`, `p(μ) = det(μI - A) = 0`.\n    c. Transform this into a polynomial for `λ` by substituting `μ = 1/λ`. This results in a polynomial `q(λ) = 0`.\n    d. Print the equation `q(λ) = 0` with its numeric coefficients.\n    e. Calculate the roots of `q(λ)=0`, which are the required values of `λ`.\n\nI will provide the code for `n=2` as a concrete example. The user can easily modify the value of `n` in the script to solve for other cases.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution.\n\n    The method involves converting the integral equation into a system of linear\n    equations of the form (I - lambda*A)a = b.
