    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  I will first identify the primary allotropes of phosphorus that exhibit distinct, observable colors under normal conditions.\n2.  The main allotropes are White Phosphorus, Red Phosphorus, Violet (Hittorf's) Phosphorus, and Black Phosphorus.\n3.  I will write a Python script that stores these four types in a list.\n4.  The script will then calculate the total count, which is the length of the list.\n5.  To meet the output requirements, the script will print the names of the allotropes being counted and then display the final summation equation leading to the total.\n\n```python\n# A list of the allotropes of phosphorus with distinct colors.\n# While white phosphorus can appear yellowish, it's counted as one color.\n# Violet (Hittorf's) phosphorus is distinct from the more common red phosphorus.\n# Black phosphorus has two forms (orthorhombic and rhombohedral) but both are black.\nphosphorus_allotropes = [\"White\", \"Red\", \"Violet\", \"Black\"]\n\n# The number of colors is the number of items in our list.\ntotal_colors = len(phosphorus_allotropes)\n\nprint(\"The number of distinct colors for the main allotropes of phosphorus can be found by summing them up.\")\nprint(\"The allotropes are: White, Red, Violet, and Black.\")\nprint(\"The calculation is:\")\n\n# Build and print the equation string, e.g., \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\"\nequation_numbers = [\"1\" for _ in phosphorus_allotropes]\nequation_str = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_colors}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
