# This script demonstrates that a graph can satisfy the problem's conditions
# while having more than two connected components. This invalidates choice B.

# --- Analysis of the problem statement ---
# The eigenvalues [0.0, 0.0, ...] imply the number of connected components, c, is >= 2.
# The condition null(B^T*B) = 2 implies the cyclomatic number, gamma, is 2.
# The cyclomatic number is given by the formula: gamma = m - n + c.
# Combining these, we have the constraint: m - n + c = 2.

# --- Test Case: Constructing a graph with c = 3 ---
# We can construct a graph from three components:
# 1. A 3-cycle graph (a triangle), which has a cyclomatic number of 1.
# 2. A 4-cycle graph (a square), which also has a cyclomatic number of 1.
# 3. An isolated vertex, which is a tree and has a cyclomatic number of 0.
# The total cyclomatic number of the combined graph is 1 + 1 + 0 = 2, as required.

# Use networkx to create the graph components
G1 = nx.cycle_graph(3)
G2 = nx.cycle_graph(4)
G3 = nx.Graph()
G3.add_node("iso_vertex") # Use a unique node name

# Combine the components into a single disconnected graph
G = nx.disjoint_union(G1, G2)
G = nx.disjoint_union(G, G3)

# Get the properties of the constructed graph
n = G.number_of_nodes()
m = G.number_of_edges()
c = nx.number_connected_components(G)

# --- Verification ---

print(f"A graph was constructed with {c} connected components.")
print("This shows that the number of components is not necessarily 2.")

print("\nProperties of this graph:")
print(f"Number of nodes (n): {n}")
print(f"Number of edges (m): {m}")
print(f"Number of connected components (c): {c}")

# We output each number in the equation.

print(f"Final Equation Check: {gamma} = {m} - {n} + {c}")

if gamma == 2:
    print("The equation holds. The constructed graph has a cyclomatic number of 2.")
    print("It also has 3 components, which is consistent with the eigenvalue data.")
else:
    print("An error occurred in the construction.")
