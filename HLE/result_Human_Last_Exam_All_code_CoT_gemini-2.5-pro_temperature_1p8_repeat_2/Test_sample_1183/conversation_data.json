    "My plan is to first address the provided SMILES string, which is chemically and syntactically invalid. I'll then deduce the user's likely intent, which seems to be finding the symmetry of a highly symmetric, planar molecule with three ethynyl (`-C#CH`) groups. A perfect and well-known example of such a molecule is 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene, which possesses D3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, my script will perform the following steps:\n1.  **Explain the Issue**: The code will start by printing a message explaining that the user-provided SMILES string is invalid and why a substitution is necessary.\n2.  **Generate 3D Structure**: It will use the `rdkit` library to generate a 3D structure for 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene from its correct SMILES string (`C#Cc1cc(C#C)cc(C#C)c1`). This involves creating a molecule object, adding hydrogen atoms, and optimizing its geometry to get a realistic 3D conformation.\n3.  **Determine Symmetry Group**: The script will then pass the atomic symbols and their 3D coordinates to the `pyscf` library. PySCF has powerful, built-in tools to analyze molecular geometry and determine the point group of the molecule.\n4.  **Print the Result**: Finally, the script will print the name of the determined symmetry point group.\n\nTo run this code, you will need to have the `pyscf` and `rdkit` libraries installed. You can install them using pip: `pip install pyscf rdkit`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: RDKit is not installed. Please install it using 'pip install rdkit'\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ntry:\n    from pyscf import gto\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: PySCF is not installed.
