    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. The full name of the former Nigerian president is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. There is no public record or credible source indicating that he has ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identified himself as such. The event you are asking about never occurred.\n\nTherefore, I will provide a Python script that clarifies this information.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_identification():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan\n  and the name \"Azikiwe\".\n  \"\"\"\n  president_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n  queried_name = \"Azikiwe\"\n\n  print(f\"The former President of Nigeria's official name is {president_name}.\")\n  print(f\"There are no public records indicating that he ever identified himself as {queried_name}.\")\n  print(\"Therefore, the event you are asking about did not happen.\")\n\ncheck_name_identification()\n```\n<<<Based on public records, the event of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe never occurred.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
