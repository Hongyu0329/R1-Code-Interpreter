    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic fate of 1,4-¹³C glucose to determine the number of labeled CO₂ molecules produced.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Trace the ¹³C labels on Glucose:** Start with a 6-carbon glucose molecule, with labels at carbon-1 (C1) and carbon-4 (C4).\n2.  **Follow through Glycolysis:** Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. I will track the position of the ¹³C labels through this process.\n    *   The key step is the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (which has the same carbon numbering as glucose) into two 3-carbon molecules: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\n    *   DHAP is then converted into G3P.\n    *   This results in two molecules of G3P, which are subsequently converted to pyruvate. I will determine which carbons in these two pyruvate molecules are labeled.\n3.  **Analyze Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** The primary process that releases CO₂ from the products of glycolysis is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a reaction catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This reaction removes the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate as CO₂.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:** By seeing which pyruvate molecules have a ¹³C label at their C1 position, I can count the number of labeled CO₂ molecules that are released.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** I will present the final count as a simple addition equation.\n\n```python\ndef trace_labeled_glucose():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the carbons of 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation\n    to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script traces the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the labeled glucose\n    # C1 and C4 are labeled with 13C.\n    # The glucose backbone is C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6.\n    print(\"Step 1: The starting molecule is glucose, labeled at Carbon-1 and Carbon-4.\")\n    print(\"Glucose: C1(13C) - C2 - C3 - C4(13C) - C5 - C6\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Cleavage in Glycolysis\n    # Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (same numbering) is cleaved between C3 and C4.\n    # This yields DHAP (from C1, C2, C3) and G3P (from C4, C5, C6).\n    print(\"Step 2: In glycolysis, the 6-carbon molecule is cleaved between C3 and C4.\")\n    print(\"This forms two 3-carbon molecules:\")\n    # First molecule is G3P\n    print(\"  - Molecule A (from C4,C5,C6 of glucose) -> becomes Pyruvate 1\")\n    # C4 of glucose becomes C1 of Pyruvate 1.
