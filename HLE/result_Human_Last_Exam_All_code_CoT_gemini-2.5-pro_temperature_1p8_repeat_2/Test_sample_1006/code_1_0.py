# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a compact
# topological space X that satisfies two specific properties concerning the long ray
# R = [0, \omega_1).

# Mathematical Reasoning:
#
# 1. Let X be a topological space satisfying the given conditions. Property (1)
#    states that X is a compact space containing a dense copy of R. This means
#    X is a compactification of R. Since R is a Tychonoff space, its compactifications
#    are typically assumed to be Hausdorff. The uniqueness of extension in property (2)
#    in fact forces X to be Hausdorff.
#
# 2. Property (2) states that every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to
#    a unique continuous function on X. This is the universal property that defines
#    the Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted βR.
#
# 3. This universal property establishes an isomorphism between the algebra of continuous
#    functions on X, C(X), and the algebra of bounded continuous functions on R, C_b(R).
#    The mapping is given by restricting a function on X to R. It's an isomorphism because
#    property (2) guarantees it is surjective, and the denseness of R in X guarantees
#    it is injective.
#
# 4. The Gelfand-Naimark theorem for commutative C*-algebras states that two compact
#    Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic if and only if their respective algebras of
#    continuous functions are isomorphic.
#
# 5. By definition of the Stone-Čech compactification, C(βR) is isomorphic to C_b(R).
#    Since we've established C(X) ≅ C_b(R), it follows that C(X) ≅ C(βR).
#
# 6. From the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, since their function algebras are isomorphic,
#    the spaces X and βR must be homeomorphic.
#
# 7. Therefore, any space X that satisfies the given conditions must be homeomorphic
#    to βR. This means that all such spaces belong to a single homeomorphism class.

# The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.

# This final part of the script will print the result as required.
number_of_classes = 1

# There is no complex equation, the result is a single number.
# The following print statements fulfill the output requirement.
