    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ for which $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Group\n\nA group is an ordered pair $(G, \\cdot)$, where $G$ is a set and $\\cdot$ is a binary operation on $G$, that satisfies the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, the result of the operation, $a \\cdot b$, is also in $G$.\n2.  **Associativity**: For any three elements $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every element $a \\in G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each element $a \\in G$, there exists an element $b \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size $n$ of the set $G$ for which we can define a binary operation $\\cdot$ such that at least one of these axioms fails.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The **Closure** property is part of the definition of a \"binary operation on a set G\". If an operation is not closed, it's not a binary operation *on G*. Therefore, we cannot fail the closure axiom; we must fail one of the other three (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n*   Standard definitions of a group in abstract algebra (e.g., in textbooks by Dummit & Foote, Herstein, Fraleigh) require the set $G$ to be **non-empty**. The axiom for the identity element states \"There exists an element $e \\in G$...\", which implies $G$ cannot be the empty set. Therefore, we must consider $n \\ge 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Smallest Possible Values of n (where n ≥ 1)\n\n**Case n = 1:**\nLet $G$ be a set with one element, say $G = \\{e\\}$.\n*   **Binary Operation**: There is only one possible binary operation we can define on $G$. The domain of the operation is $G \\times G = \\{(e, e)\\}$, and the codomain must be $G = \\{e\\}$. So, the operation must be $e \\cdot e = e$.\n*   **Check Group Axioms**:\n    1.  **Closure**: The result $e \\cdot e = e$ is in $G$. This holds.\n    2.  **Associativity**: We need to check if $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c \\in G$. Since there is only one element, we check $(e \\cdot e) \\cdot e = e \\cdot (e \\cdot e)$. This simplifies to $e \\cdot e = e \\cdot e$, which is $e=e$. This holds.\n    3.  **Identity Element**: We need an element $i \\in G$ such that $i \\cdot a = a \\cdot i = a$ for all $a \\in G$. The only element is $e$. Let's check if it's the identity: $e \\cdot e = e$. This holds. So, $e$ is the identity element.\n    4.  **Inverse Element**: For each element $a \\in G$, we need an inverse. The only element is $e$. Its inverse must be an element $b \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot b = e$. Choosing $b=e$, we get $e \\cdot e = e$, which is true. So, the inverse of $e$ is $e$. This holds.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1**: All four group axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element and a binary operation must form a group (this is known as the trivial group). Therefore, $n$ cannot be 1.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\nLet $G$ be a set with two elements, say $G = \\{a, b\\}$. We need to see if we can define a binary operation $\\cdot$ on $G$ that fails to be a group. We only need to find one such example.\n*   **Attempt to define a non-group operation**: Let's try to define an operation that fails the identity element axiom. Consider the following operation defined by its Cayley table:\n    \n| ⋅ | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| **a** | a | a |\n| **b** | b | b |\n\n*   **Check Group Axioms**:\n    1.  **Closure**: All the results in the table (`a` and `b`) are elements of $G$. This holds.\n    2.  **Associativity**: The operation is defined as $x \\cdot y = x$. Let's check the associative law: $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot z = x$. And $x \\cdot (y \\cdot z) = x \\cdot y = x$. Since both sides equal $x$, the operation is associative. This holds.\n    3.  **Identity Element**: We need to find an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot x = x \\cdot e = x$ for all $x \\in G$.\n        *   Let's test if $a$ is the identity. We need $a \\cdot b = b$. But from our table, $a \\cdot b = a$. Since $a \\neq b$, $a$ is not the identity element.\n        *   Let's test if $b$ is the identity. We need $b \\cdot a = a$. But from our table, $b \\cdot a = b$. Since $b \\neq a$, $b$ is not the identity element.\n    *   Since neither element can act as the identity, the structure has no identity element.\n*   **Conclusion for n=2**: We have successfully constructed a set $G$ with 2 elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ such that $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nWe are looking for the smallest number $n$ for which a non-group structure can be defined.\n*   We showed that for $n=1$, any structure $(G, \\cdot)$ must be a group.\n*   We showed that for $n=2$, it is possible to define a structure $(G, \\cdot)$ that is not a group.\n\nSince $n=1$ is not a possible answer and $n=2$ is a possible answer, the smallest such number is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
