    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry is explicitly defined. The bromine atom is a good leaving group.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base, a polar protic solvent that is a poor nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction. Substitution reactions (SN1, SN2) are disfavored.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, Br) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. The leaving group must be in an axial position, and the proton being eliminated must also be in an axial position on an adjacent carbon.\n\n**Step 3: Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) configuration indicates that the bromo group and the methyl group are **trans** to each other.\n*   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one where both substituents are equatorial (diequatorial) and one where both are axial (diaxial).\n    *   **Conformer A (diequatorial):** The bromine atom is equatorial, and the methyl group is equatorial. This is the more stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the less crowded equatorial position. However, in this conformation, the bromine is not axial, so it **cannot undergo an E2 reaction**.\n    *   **Conformer B (diaxial):** The bromine atom is axial, and the methyl group is axial. This is the less stable conformation, but it is the one that is **required for the E2 reaction to occur** because the leaving group (Br) is in the necessary axial position. The reaction will proceed through this minor, but reactive, conformation.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Available β-Hydrogens for Elimination**\n*   We must analyze Conformer B, where the bromine at C1 is axial. The β-carbons (carbons adjacent to C1) are C2 and C6. We need to look for axial hydrogens on these carbons.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon has the methyl group. Since the methyl group is in the axial position in this conformer, the hydrogen on C2 must be in the **equatorial** position. This equatorial hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, **elimination cannot occur towards C2**. (This would have formed the more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene).\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen at C6** is trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) to the axial bromine at C1. Therefore, the tert-butoxide base can remove this proton.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\n*   Since the only available anti-periplanar β-hydrogen is on C6, the elimination must occur by removing the H from C6 and the Br from C1.\n*   This forms a double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group on C2 is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   The resulting alkene is named by numbering the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2), and then locating the substituent. The double bond is between the original C1 and C6. The methyl group is on the original C2. In the product, the methyl group is on the carbon adjacent to the double bond, at position 3.\n*   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n1.  Recognize the reaction is E2 due to the strong, bulky base.\n2.  Recall the strict anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) requirement for E2 on a cyclohexane ring.\n3.  Correctly determine the relationship between the substituents (1S,2R is trans).\n4.  Draw the reactive chair conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial. For a trans-1,2-disubstituted ring, this forces the other substituent (Me) to also be axial.\n5.  Identify that only the hydrogen on C6 is axial and thus available for elimination. The hydrogen on C2 is equatorial and cannot be removed.\n6.  Conclude that the product is dictated by stereoelectronics, not by the Zaitsev/Hofmann rule (though in this case, the stereoelectronically required product happens to be the Hofmann product).\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
