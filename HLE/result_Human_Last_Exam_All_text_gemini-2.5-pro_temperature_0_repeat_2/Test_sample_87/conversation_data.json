    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following values for mutual information (MI) and conditional mutual information (CMI) for random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable, $W$, is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$. This implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Derive Other Information-Theoretic Quantities**\n\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information to find other quantities for the system $(X,Y,Z)$. The chain rule states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$.\n\nApplying this to $I(X; Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n\nEquating these two expressions for $I(X;Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nWe can also find the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\n\nUsing the interaction information, we can find all pairwise MI and conditional MI values (this is a good consistency check):\n*   $I(X;Y) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Y;Z) = 2 + 1 = 3$. (Matches given)\n*   $I(X;Z) = I(X;Z|Y) + I(X;Y;Z) = 5 + 1 = 6$. (Matches derived)\n*   $I(Y;Z) = I(Y;Z|X) + I(X;Y;Z)$.\n*   $I(Y;Z|X) = I(Y;X|Z) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$. (This is not always true, but let's check)\nLet's use the symmetry of the full expression for $I(X;Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(Z;X,Y) = I(Z;Y) + I(Z;X|Y) = I(Y;Z) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(Y;Z) + 5$.\nSince $I(X;Y,Z)=8$, we have $I(Y;Z) + 5 = 8 \\implies I(Y;Z) = 3$.\nNow we can find $I(Y;Z|X)$:\n$I(Y;Z) = I(Y;Z|X) + I(X;Y;Z) \\implies 3 = I(Y;Z|X) + 1 \\implies I(Y;Z|X) = 2$.\n\nSo, we have a complete description of the information diagram for $(X,Y,Z)$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(Y;Z) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(Y;Z|X) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Y;Z) = 1$\n\n**3. Set up the Expression for the Target Quantity**\n\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's use two fundamental identities that relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known quantities.\n\n*   **Identity 1 (using the chain rule on variables):**\n    $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = 3 + I(X;W|Y)$.\n    $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$.\n    Equating these gives: $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n*   **Identity 2 (using the chain rule on conditioning):**\n    The relationship between CMI with different conditioning variables is given by:\n    $I(A;B|C) = I(A;B|D) + I(A;D|C) - I(A;D|B,C)$.\n    Applying this with $A=X, B=Y, C=W, D=Z$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    Since we know $I(X;Y|Z)=2$, this becomes:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n**4. Bound the Expression**\n\nLet's equate the two expressions for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n$1 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nWe also know that $I(A;B;C) = I(A;B) - I(A;B|C) = I(A;C) - I(A;C|B)$.\nSo, $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = -I(X;Y;W)$.\nAnd $I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W) = -I(Y;X;W)$.\nSince $I(X;Y;W) = -I(Y;X;W)$, we have $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W)$.\n\nLet's substitute this into our equation:\n$1 + (I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W)) = I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nNow we use the crucial property that $W$ is a function of $Z$. This leads to the **Data Processing Inequality** for conditional mutual information: for any variables $A, B$, we have $I(A;W|B) \\le I(A;Z|B)$.\nLet's apply this to the term $I(Y;W|X)$:\n$I(Y;W|X) \\le I(Y;Z|X)$.\nFrom step 2, we know $I(Y;Z|X) = 2$. So, $I(Y;W|X) \\le 2$.\n\nWe also know that mutual information is non-negative: $I(Y;W) \\ge 0$.\n\nNow we can bound the left-hand side (LHS) of our equation:\nLHS = $1 + I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W) \\le 1 + 2 - 0 = 3$.\n\nThis gives us a bound on the right-hand side (RHS):\n$I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W) \\le 3$.\n\nFinally, we can use this bound in Identity 2 for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)) \\le 2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound of 5 for the value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**5. Check if the Bound is Achievable**\n\nThe maximum value of 5 is achieved if the inequalities we used become equalities. This requires:\n1.  $I(Y;W|X) = 2$\n2.  $I(Y;W) = 0$\n\nLet's check if these conditions are mutually consistent and compatible with the given information.\n*   From $I(Y;W|X) \\le I(Y;Z|X)$, the condition $I(Y;W|X)=2$ implies that $I(Y;Z|X,W) = I(Y;Z|X) - I(Y;W|X) = 2 - 2 = 0$. This is a valid state.\n*   The condition $I(Y;W)=0$ means that $Y$ and $W$ are independent.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest *possible* value, which means we can assume that a joint distribution $p(x,y,z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ exist that satisfy these conditions, as long as they don't lead to a mathematical contradiction.\nLet's check for contradictions.\nIf $I(Y;W|X)=2$ and $I(Y;W)=0$, then from Identity 1 (rearranged):\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W)) = 3 + (2 - 0) = 5$.\nThis is consistent with our derived bound.\nLet's check other relations:\n$I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = I(Y;W|X) - I(Y;W) = 2$.\nSo, $I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + 2$.\nWe must satisfy $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, which means $I(X;W) + 2 \\le 5 \\implies I(X;W) \\le 3$.\nWe must also satisfy $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z) = 6$. This is consistent with $I(X;W) \\le 3$.\nThere is no obvious contradiction that prevents the existence of a system where $I(Y;W)=0$ and $I(Y;W|X)=2$. Therefore, the upper bound of 5 is considered achievable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that $I(X;Y|W)$ is bounded above by 5. This bound is achievable under conditions that are not mutually contradictory. Thus, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
