    "This problem asks us to reorder the numbers in a given sum string into non-decreasing order. The key constraints are that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we must find the solution that is the most memory-efficient in C, then report the total memory used by its variables.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The core task is to sort the numbers present in the input string. For example, if the input is `3+2+1+1`, the numbers are 3, 2, 1, 1. The sorted sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3. The required output is the new sum string: `1+1+2+3`.\n\n2.  **Choosing the Right Algorithm:** Since the numbers are from a very small and fixed set {1, 2, 3, 4}, a general-purpose sorting algorithm like Quicksort or Mergesort is unnecessary and less efficient. The best approach is **Counting Sort**. We can simply count the occurrences of '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's.\n\n3.  **Optimizing for Memory:** The prompt emphasizes creating the \"most memory-efficient C program\". A naive approach would be to read the entire input string into a character array.\n    *   `char s[1001];` (since the string can be up to 1000 characters long, plus one for the null terminator).\n    This buffer alone would consume **1001 bytes**, which is substantial.\n    *   A more memory-efficient strategy is to process the input character by character without storing the whole string. We can achieve this in C using the `getchar()` function, which reads a single character from standard input. This completely eliminates the need for the large input buffer.\n\n4.  **Designing the Memory-Efficient Program:**\n    *   **Input Processing:** We will loop using `getchar()` to read characters one by one. We only care about the digit characters ('1', '2', '3', '4'). The '+' characters can be ignored during this phase.\n    *   **Counting:** We need variables to store the counts of each number. An array is a good choice for this. Let's call it `counts`.\n    *   **Output Generation:** After counting all the numbers, we will construct the output string. We can do this by looping from 1 to 4. For each number `i`, we print it `counts[i]` times. We must also print the '+' separator between the numbers, but not before the first number or after the last one. A simple flag variable can manage this logic.\n\n### Listing Careful Points and Variable Sizing\n\nTo minimize memory, we must choose the smallest possible standard C data type for each variable. We assume a typical environment where `sizeof(char)`=1, `sizeof(short)`=2, and `sizeof(int)`=4.\n\n1.  **Counters (`counts` array):**\n    *   The input string has a maximum length of 1000. The format is `d+d+d...`. The maximum number of terms is for a string like `1+1+...+1`, which would have `(1000+1)/2 = 500.5`, so 501 terms.\n    *   Therefore, a counter must be able to hold a value up to 501.\n    *   `char` (max 127) or `unsigned char` (max 255) is too small.\n    *   `short` (max 32,767) is sufficient.\n    *   We need 4 counters, so we declare `short counts[4];`.\n    *   Memory: 4 * `sizeof(short)` = 4 * 2 = **8 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Input Character Variable (`c`):**\n    *   The `getchar()` function returns an `int`. This is necessary to be able to represent all possible character values as well as the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value. We cannot use `char` here.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Output Separator Flag (`first_term`):**\n    *   We need a simple flag to track whether we are printing the first number (to avoid a leading '+'). A boolean-like variable is perfect.\n    *   `char` is the smallest data type and can easily serve as a flag (e.g., 1 for true, 0 for false).\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n4.  **Loop Counters (`i`, `j`):**\n    *   The outer loop for printing will iterate through our number types (1, 2, 3, 4). The counter `i` will go from 0 to 3. A `char` is sufficient.\n    *   Memory for `i`: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   The inner loop will iterate up to the count of a specific number, which can be at most 501. The counter `j` must hold this value. A `short` is sufficient.\n    *   Memory for `j`: `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\n### Final Memory Calculation\n\nSumming the memory usage of all variables required for the most efficient implementation:\n\n*   `counts` array: 8 bytes\n*   `c` variable for `getchar()`: 4 bytes\n*   `first_term` flag: 1 byte\n*   `i` loop counter: 1 byte\n*   `j` loop counter: 2 bytes\n\nTotal memory `m` = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 16 bytes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
