    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form for the given discrete-time system.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and the Duality Principle**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find the new output matrix, C_o, after transforming the system to its observer canonical form. The problem specifies using the principle of duality.\n\nThe duality principle states that the observability of a system (A, C) is dual to the controllability of its dual system (A^T, C^T). This means we can find the observer canonical form for (A, C) by first finding the controller canonical form for the dual system (A^T, C^T) and then transposing the resulting matrices.\n\nLet the observer canonical form be (A_o, C_o) and the controller canonical form of the dual system be (A_c, B_c). Then, by duality:\nA_o = A_c^T\nC_o = B_c^T\n\n**2. Define the Dual System**\n\nThe dual system is defined by (A_d, B_d), where:\nA_d = A^T\nB_d = C^T\n\nLet's compute these matrices:\nA_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nThe dual system is z(k+1) = A_d * z(k) + B_d * u(k).\n\n**3. Check Controllability and Find Controllability Indices of the Dual System**\n\nTo transform the dual system to controller canonical form, we first need to check its controllability. We construct the controllability matrix W_c = [B_d | A_d*B_d | A_d^2*B_d | ...].\nLet the columns of B_d be b1 and b2:\nb1 = [0, 1, 0]^T\nb2 = [1, 1, 0]^T\n\nNow, compute A_d*b1 and A_d*b2:\nA_d*b1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T\nA_d*b2 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]^T = [3, 2, 1]^T\n\nThe controllability matrix starts with W_c = [b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...].\nWe need to find n=3 linearly independent vectors by scanning the columns of W_c from left to right.\n1.  v1 = b1 = [0, 1, 0]^T. (Linearly independent)\n2.  v2 = b2 = [1, 1, 0]^T. (Linearly independent from v1)\n3.  v3 = A_d*b1 = [2, 1, 1]^T. (Linearly independent from {v1, v2}, since its third component is non-zero while the others are zero).\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors, so the dual system is controllable.\n\n**4. Construct the Transformation Matrix for the Dual System**\n\nThe transformation matrix, P, that converts the dual system to controller canonical form is the inverse of the matrix Q, which is formed by the linearly independent vectors we just found.\nQ = [v1, v2, v3] = [b1, b2, A_d*b1]\nQ = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]\n\nNow, we find the inverse of Q, which is P = Q^-1.\nUsing matrix inversion methods (like Gaussian elimination or adjugate matrix method), we find:\nP = Q^-1 = [[-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, -2], [0, 0, 1]]\n\n**5. Transform the Dual System to Controller Canonical Form**\n\nThe controller canonical form (A_c, B_c) is given by:\nA_c = P * A_d * P^-1 = P * A_d * Q\nB_c = P * B_d\n\nWe are interested in C_o, which is B_c^T. So, we only need to compute B_c.\nB_c = P * B_d = [[-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, -2], [0, 0, 1]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\nB_c = [[(-1*0 + 1*1 + 1*0), (-1*1 + 1*1 + 1*0)],\n       [(1*0 + 0*1 + -2*0), (1*1 + 0*1 + -2*0)],\n       [(0*0 + 0*1 + 1*0), (0*1 + 0*1 + 1*0)]]\nB_c = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0]]\n\n**6. Determine the New Output Matrix C_o**\n\nBy the principle of duality, the new output matrix C_o for the observer canonical form is the transpose of B_c.\nC_o = B_c^T\nC_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]\n\nThis is the final value for the new matrix C.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]>>>"
