    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe goal is to identify all historical (real-world) mountains mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* and then determine which one is the tallest, excluding Mount Olympus itself.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mount Olympus as the Tallest**\nMount Olympus is the most prominent mountain in the *Iliad*, serving as the home of the gods. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Olympus:** Elevation: 2,918 meters (9,573 ft). This is our benchmark, and we are looking for the next tallest.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Other Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nWe must search the text of the *Iliad* for other named mountains.\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is frequently mentioned as a place from which Zeus watches the Trojan War. It is located near ancient Troy in modern-day Turkey.\n    *   **Mention:** *Iliad*, Book 8, Zeus travels to \"many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts.\"\n    *   **Modern Name:** Kaz Dağı\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n\n*   **The Peak of Samothrace:** Poseidon uses this peak to watch the battle, as it provides a clear view of Troy and the surrounding area.\n    *   **Mention:** *Iliad*, Book 13, Poseidon \"sat down on the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace, and watched the fighting.\"\n    *   **Modern Name:** Fengari, on the island of Samothrace\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** This mountain is mentioned as a landmark during Hera's journey from Olympus to Lemnos.\n    *   **Mention:** *Iliad*, Book 14, Hera's flight takes her \"over the snowy mountains of the Thracian horsemen... and from their peak she stepped to Athos.\"\n    *   **Modern Name:** Mount Athos\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain is mentioned as the source of the ash wood used to make the spear of Achilles, a gift from the centaur Chiron to his father, Peleus.\n    *   **Mention:** *Iliad*, Book 16, Patroclus arms himself with Achilles' weapons, but not \"the spear of the blameless son of Aeacus, heavy, huge, and stout, which no other of the Achaeans could wield, but Achilles alone was skilled to wield it, a spear of Pelian ash.\"\n    *   **Modern Name:** Mount Pelion\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain is mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" section as the location of the Maeonians, allies of the Trojans.\n    *   **Mention:** *Iliad*, Book 2, describing the forces \"of the Maeonians, who were born under snowy Tmolus.\"\n    *   **Modern Name:** Bozdağ\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,157 meters (7,077 ft)\n\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** This mountain is also referenced in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" as a geographical marker for the territory of the Phocians.\n    *   **Mention:** *Iliad*, Book 2, listing the Phocians who \"dwelt in Crisa and Panopeus... and held the region around Parnassus.\"\n    *   **Modern Name:** Mount Parnassus\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,457 meters (8,061 ft)\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Elevations**\nNow, we list the identified mountains (excluding Olympus) in order of their height:\n\n1.  **Mount Parnassus:** 2,457 m\n2.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,157 m\n3.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n4.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n6.  **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 m\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Findings**\nAfter Mount Olympus (2,918 m), the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Parnassus, with an elevation of 2,457 meters.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Historical vs. Mythological:** All the mountains listed are real, historical locations that can be identified today.\n2.  **Source Text:** The analysis is strictly based on mountains explicitly named or clearly referenced within the text of the *Iliad*. Other mountains famous in Greek mythology (like Ossa or Cithaeron) are not included unless mentioned in the epic.\n3.  **Context of Mention:** The mountains are mentioned in various contexts: as divine vantage points (Ida, Samothrace), as geographical landmarks in travel (Athos), as markers for a people's homeland (Parnassus, Tmolus), or as a source of materials (Pelion).\n4.  **Accurate Elevations:** The conclusion relies on modern, accepted measurements of these mountains' heights.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus is Mount Parnassus.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
