    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is denoted by $f^{\\lambda}$ and can be calculated using the hook-length formula.\n\nThe hook-length formula is given by:\n$$ f^{\\lambda} = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in \\lambda} h_{\\lambda}(i, j)} $$\nwhere the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{\\lambda}(i, j)$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to the right of $(i,j)$ in the same row, plus the number of cells below $(i,j)$ in the same column, plus 1 (for the cell itself).\n\nWe are looking for the number of partitions of $n=25$ for which $f^{\\lambda} < 500,000$.\n\nThe dimensions of irreps are smallest for partitions that are \"hook-shaped\", i.e., partitions of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$ or their conjugates $(k+1, 1^{n-k-1})$, and for partitions with few rows/columns, like $(n-k, k)$ or their conjugates $(2^k, 1^{n-2k})$. As partitions become more \"central\" (parts are closer in size), the dimension tends to increase significantly.\n\nWe will systematically list partitions, starting from those most likely to have small dimensions, and calculate their corresponding dimensions. For each partition $\\lambda$ found, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ has the same dimension ($f^{\\lambda} = f^{\\lambda'}$). If $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate, this gives us two irreps. We must check that none of the found partitions are self-conjugate.\n\nLet's categorize partitions by $k = 25 - \\lambda_1$.\n\n**1. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 25$ ($k=0$)**\n*   $\\lambda = (25)$: $f^{(25)} = 1$.\n*   Conjugate $\\lambda' = (1^{25})$: $f^{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    (2 irreps)\n\n**2. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 24$ ($k=1$)**\n*   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: $f^{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$.\n*   Conjugate $\\lambda' = (2, 1^{23})$: $f^{(2, 1^{23})} = 24$.\n    (2 irreps)\n\n**3. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 23$ ($k=2$)**\n*   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $f^{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n*   $\\lambda = (23, 1^2)$: $f^{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    These and their conjugates give 4 irreps.\n\n**4. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 22$ ($k=3$)**\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $f^{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$.\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $f^{(22,2,1)} = 4025$.\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 1^3)$: $f^{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n    These and their conjugates give 6 irreps.\n\n**5. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 21$ ($k=4$)**\n*   Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1^4). All 5 lead to dimensions < 500,000.\n*   $f^{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n*   $f^{(21,3,1)} = 31,350$.\n*   $f^{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n*   $f^{(21,2,1^2)} = 31,625$.\n*   $f^{(21,1^4)} = 10,626$.\n    These and their conjugates give 10 irreps.\n\n**6. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 20$ ($k=5$)**\n*   Partitions of 5 are (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1^3), (1^5). All 7 lead to dimensions < 500,000.\n*   $f^{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n*   $f^{(20,4,1)} = 164,220$.\n*   $f^{(20,3,2)} = 103,500$.\n*   $f^{(20,3,1^2)} = 150,480$.\n*   $f^{(20,2,2,1)} = 103,950$.\n*   $f^{(20,2,1^3)} = 167,245$.\n*   $f^{(20,1^5)} = 42,504$.\n    These and their conjugates give 14 irreps.\n\n**7. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 19$ ($k=6$)**\n*   We check partitions of 6.\n*   $f^{(19,6)} = 123,970$.\n*   $f^{(19,5,1)} = 316,250$.\n*   $f^{(19,4,2)} = 480,700$.\n*   $f^{(19,4,1^2)} = 456,960$.\n*   $f^{(19,3,3)} = 456,960$.\n*   $f^{(19,3,2,1)} = 560,560$ (> 500,000). More central partitions of 6 will also have larger dimensions.\n*   $f^{(19,2^3)} = 354,780$.\n*   $f^{(19,1^6)} = 177,100$.\n    We find 7 such partitions. These and their conjugates give 14 irreps.\n\n**8. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 18$ ($k=7$)**\n*   $f^{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480,700 - 177,100 = 303,600$.\n*   $f^{(18,6,1)} = 846,720$ (> 500,000).\n*   $f^{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. Wait, let me recompute. $f^{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. This is a new one.\n    Let's re-check the list for k=7.\n    (18,7) -> 303,600. OK.\n    (18,1^7) -> 346,104. OK.\n    (18,6,1) -> 846,720. > 500k.\n    (18,5,2) -> 1,037,835. > 500k.\n    So for k=7, we have 2 partitions: (18,7) and (18,1^7). These and their conjugates give 4 irreps.\n\n**9. Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 17$ ($k=8$)**\n*   $f^{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$ (> 500,000).\n*   $f^{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$ (> 500,000).\n    No partitions starting with 17 or less will have dimensions under 500,000.\n\n**Final Count:**\n*   k=0: 1 partition, (25). With its conjugate, 2 irreps.\n*   k=1: 1 partition, (24,1). With its conjugate, 2 irreps.\n*   k=2: 2 partitions, (23,2), (23,1^2). With conjugates, 4 irreps.\n*   k=3: 3 partitions. With conjugates, 6 irreps.\n*   k=4: 5 partitions. With conjugates, 10 irreps.\n*   k=5: 7 partitions. With conjugates, 14 irreps.\n*   k=6: 7 partitions. With conjugates, 14 irreps.\n*   k=7: 2 partitions, (18,7), (18,1^7). With conjugates, 4 irreps.\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 56$.\nNone of these partitions are self-conjugate, so we correctly counted each pair.\n\nLet's re-verify $f^{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = \\frac{24 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 22 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 18}{7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 3 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 22 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 6 / (6 \\cdot 5) = ...$\n$\\binom{24}{7} = \\frac{24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{5040} = \\frac{1744364160}{5040} = 346104$. This is correct.\n\nTotal count: $2+2+4+6+10+14+14+4 = 56$.\n\nFinal list of partition types (excluding conjugates):\n*   k=0: (25) - 1\n*   k=1: (24,1) - 1\n*   k=2: (23,2), (23,1^2) - 2\n*   k=3: (22,3), (22,2,1), (22,1^3) - 3\n*   k=4: (21,4), (21,3,1), (21,2,2), (21,2,1^2), (21,1^4) - 5\n*   k=5: (20,5), (20,4,1), (20,3,2), (20,3,1^2), (20,2,2,1), (20,2,1^3), (20,1^5) - 7\n*   k=6: (19,6), (19,5,1), (19,4,2), (19,4,1^2), (19,3,3), (19,2^3), (19,1^6) - 7\n*   k=7: (18,7), (18,1^7) - 2\nTotal partitions = $1+1+2+3+5+7+7+2 = 28$.\nSince none are self-conjugate, the total number of irreps is $28 \\times 2 = 56$.\n\n<<<56>>>"
