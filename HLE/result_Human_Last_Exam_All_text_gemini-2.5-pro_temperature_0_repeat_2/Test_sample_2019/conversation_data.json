    "This problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Attack Rules\n\n*   **5x5 Board:** A grid with 5 rows and 5 columns, indexed from 0 to 4.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around on its edges. The column to the right of column 4 is column 0, and the row below row 4 is row 0. This is equivalent to performing all calculations of coordinates modulo 5.\n*   **Non-attacking Queens:** No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n*   **Toroidal Diagonals:** The wrapping affects how diagonals are defined. Two queens at positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` are considered to be on the same diagonal if they satisfy one of the following conditions (in addition to the standard row and column attacks):\n    1.  **Main Diagonal:** `r1 - c1 ≡ r2 - c2 (mod 5)`\n    2.  **Anti-Diagonal:** `r1 + c1 ≡ r2 + c2 (mod 5)`\n\nA valid placement of 4 queens requires that the 4 queens are on:\n*   4 different rows.\n*   4 different columns.\n*   4 different main diagonals (as defined by `r-c mod 5`).\n*   4 different anti-diagonals (as defined by `r+c mod 5`).\n\n### Step 2: The `(n-1)`-Queens to `n`-Queens Correspondence\n\nA key insight for this problem is the relationship between the `(n-1)`-queens problem and the `n`-queens problem on an `n x n` toroidal board, especially when `n` is a prime number like 5.\n\nLet's denote `N_k` as the number of ways to place `k` non-attacking queens on the 5x5 toroidal board. We want to find `N_4`. We can do this by first finding `N_5` and then establishing a relationship between `N_4` and `N_5`.\n\n**From a 4-queen solution to a 5-queen solution:**\nSuppose we have a valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens.\n1.  These 4 queens occupy 4 out of 5 rows. Let the unoccupied row be `r_empty`.\n2.  They occupy 4 out of 5 columns. Let the unoccupied column be `c_empty`.\n3.  They occupy 4 out of 5 main diagonals. Let the unoccupied main diagonal index be `d1_empty`.\n4.  They occupy 4 out of 5 anti-diagonals. Let the unoccupied anti-diagonal index be `d2_empty`.\n\nCan we place a 5th queen? The only available square that is not in an occupied row or column is `(r_empty, c_empty)`. Let's check which diagonals this square occupies.\n*   Its main diagonal index is `r_empty - c_empty (mod 5)`.\n*   Its anti-diagonal index is `r_empty + c_empty (mod 5)`.\n\nA mathematical property on a toroidal board where `n` is prime states that this 5th queen will perfectly occupy the empty diagonals. That is, `r_empty - c_empty ≡ d1_empty (mod 5)` and `r_empty + c_empty ≡ d2_empty (mod 5)`.\nThis means that any valid 4-queen configuration can be extended to a valid 5-queen configuration by adding a single queen, and this extension is unique.\n\n**From a 5-queen solution to a 4-queen solution:**\nSuppose we have a valid placement of 5 non-attacking queens. This is a set of 5 queen positions. If we remove any one of the 5 queens, the remaining 4 queens are, by definition, not attacking each other. Therefore, from any single 5-queen solution, we can generate 5 different 4-queen solutions.\n\n**The Relationship:**\nSince every 4-queen solution corresponds to exactly one 5-queen solution, and every 5-queen solution can generate 5 distinct 4-queen solutions, we can establish the following relationship:\n`N_4 = 5 * N_5`\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Number of 5-Queen Solutions (`N_5`)\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to finding the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\nA solution will have one queen in each row and each column. We can represent a solution by a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, where the queens are placed at `(i, p(i))` for `i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`.\n\nThe diagonal constraints require:\n1.  The values `i - p(i) (mod 5)` must all be distinct for `i = 0..4`.\n2.  The values `i + p(i) (mod 5)` must all be distinct for `i = 0..4`.\n\nFor a prime `n` (like 5), it is a known result that all such permutations `p` are linear, of the form:\n`p(i) = a*i + b (mod 5)`\n\nLet's find the valid values for `a` and `b`.\n*   `b` can be any value from `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` (5 choices). This corresponds to a cyclic shift of the solution along the columns.\n*   For `p(i)` to be a permutation, `a` must be non-zero modulo 5. So `a ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   For `i - p(i) = i - (ai+b) = (1-a)i - b` to be a permutation of values, the coefficient `(1-a)` must be non-zero modulo 5. This means `a ≠ 1`.\n*   For `i + p(i) = i + (ai+b) = (1+a)i + b` to be a permutation of values, the coefficient `(1+a)` must be non-zero modulo 5. This means `a ≠ -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`.\n\nSo, `a` must be from `{1, 2, 3, 4}` but cannot be `1` or `4`. This leaves `a = 2` or `a = 3`.\n*   Number of choices for `a`: 2\n*   Number of choices for `b`: 5\n\nThe total number of 5-queen solutions is `N_5 = 2 * 5 = 10`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nUsing the relationship from Step 2 and the result from Step 3:\n`N_4 = 5 * N_5`\n`N_4 = 5 * 10`\n`N_4 = 50`\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
