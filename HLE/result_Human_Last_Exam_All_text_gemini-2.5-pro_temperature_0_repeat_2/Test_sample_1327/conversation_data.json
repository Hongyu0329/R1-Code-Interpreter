    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial sequence**\nThe given sequence of numbers is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\nOur goal is to find the pattern governing this sequence to determine the next number.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple pattern (Differences)**\nLet's calculate the difference between consecutive terms.\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. This does not seem to be a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. Let's check the second-level differences.\n*   12 - 9 = 3\n*   28 - 12 = 16\n*   68 - 28 = 40\nThe second-level differences are 3, 16, 40. This also does not reveal an obvious pattern. So, a simple difference-based pattern is unlikely.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a multiplicative pattern**\nLet's see if each term can be derived from the previous one by multiplying and then adding or subtracting a number.\n*   **Relationship between 2 and 11:** 11 is roughly 5 times 2, or 2 times 2 plus something.\n*   **Relationship between 11 and 23:** 23 is roughly 2 times 11. Let's check: 2 * 11 = 22. So, 23 = 2 * 11 + 1.\n*   **Relationship between 23 and 51:** 51 is roughly 2 times 23. Let's check: 2 * 23 = 46. So, 51 = 2 * 23 + 5.\n*   **Relationship between 51 and 119:** 119 is roughly 2 times 51. Let's check: 2 * 51 = 102. So, 119 = 2 * 51 + 17.\nThis pattern `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + c` gives us a sequence of added numbers: 1, 5, 17 (starting from the third term). This sequence doesn't have an obvious pattern.\n\nLet's try multiplying by 3.\n*   **Relationship between 11 and 23:** 23 is roughly 3 times 11. Let's check: 3 * 11 = 33. So, 23 = 3 * 11 - 10.\n*   **Relationship between 23 and 51:** 51 is roughly 3 times 23. Let's check: 3 * 23 = 69. So, 51 = 3 * 23 - 18.\n*   **Relationship between 51 and 119:** 119 is roughly 3 times 51. Let's check: 3 * 51 = 153. So, 119 = 3 * 51 - 34.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the discovered pattern**\nWe have found a consistent pattern starting from the third term: `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - c_n`.\nThe numbers being subtracted form a sequence: 10, 18, 34.\nLet's find the pattern within this new sequence.\n*   Calculate the differences:\n    *   18 - 10 = 8\n    *   34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences are 8 and 16. This is a clear geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the pattern to find the next number**\n1.  The next difference in the subtraction sequence should be 16 * 2 = 32.\n2.  The next number to be subtracted will be the previous one (34) plus this new difference (32): 34 + 32 = 66.\n3.  Now, we can find the missing number in the main sequence using our rule: `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - 66`.\n    *   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 357 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 291`\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe pattern is that each number (from the third onwards) is three times the previous number, minus a value. This value itself follows a pattern: the amount subtracted increases by a value that doubles each time (8, 16, 32, ...). Following this logic, the next number in the sequence is 291. This matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The pattern does not always start from the first term. In this case, the rule `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - c_n` begins with `a_3`.\n*   The problem may involve multiple layers of patterns. Here, the main pattern involved a secondary sequence, which itself had a clear pattern in its differences.\n*   It's important to test a discovered pattern against all the given numbers to ensure it is consistent.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe next term is 3 * 119 - (34 + (16 * 2)) = 357 - (34 + 32) = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
