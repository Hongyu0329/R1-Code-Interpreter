    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph with 12345 vertices, given that the graph is not a complete graph. Let's analyze this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\n*   **Graph G:** A graph with a set of vertices $V$ and edges $E$.\n*   **Number of vertices:** $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n*   **Proper Vertex Coloring:** An assignment of a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   **Chromatic Number, $\\chi(G)$:** The minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of $G$.\n*   **Complete Graph, $K_n$:** A graph on $n$ vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. For a complete graph, all vertices must have different colors, so $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n*   **Constraint:** The graph $G$ is *not* the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n*   **Objective:** Find the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ for any graph $G$ that satisfies these conditions. In other words, we want to find $\\max\\{\\chi(G) \\mid |V(G)| = 12345, G \\neq K_{12345}\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Relevant Concepts\n\n1.  The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n2.  The condition $G \\neq K_n$ is crucial. It implies that there exists at least one pair of vertices in $G$ that are *not* connected by an edge.\n3.  The chromatic number of any graph on $n$ vertices is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This bound is achieved only by the complete graph $K_n$.\n4.  We need to find a tight upper bound for $\\chi(G)$ under the given constraint. This involves two parts:\n    a. Proving that for any graph $G$ satisfying the conditions, its chromatic number is less than or equal to some value $k$.\n    b. Showing that there exists at least one graph $G$ satisfying the conditions whose chromatic number is exactly $k$.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet $n = 12345$.\n\n**Part A: Finding an Upper Bound**\n\nLet $G$ be any graph with $n$ vertices such that $G \\neq K_n$. We want to show that $G$ can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors.\n\n1.  Since $G$ is not a complete graph, there must be at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between $u$ and $v$).\n2.  We can devise a coloring strategy based on this fact. Let's try to color $G$ using a palette of $n-1$ colors, say $\\{c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n-1}\\}$.\n3.  Consider the graph $G'$ formed by \"contracting\" or \"identifying\" the two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ into a single new vertex, let's call it $w$. Any vertex that was adjacent to either $u$ or $v$ in $G$ is now adjacent to $w$ in $G'$.\n4.  The new graph $G'$ has $n-1$ vertices. The maximum number of colors any graph on $n-1$ vertices can require is $n-1$. So, we can find a proper coloring for $G'$ using at most $n-1$ colors. Let's call this coloring $C'$.\n5.  We can use this coloring $C'$ of $G'$ to define a coloring $C$ for our original graph $G$.\n    *   For any vertex $x$ in $G$ that is not $u$ or $v$, we assign it the color it has in $G'$, i.e., $C(x) = C'(x)$.\n    *   For the vertices $u$ and $v$, we assign them the color that the contracted vertex $w$ had in $G'$, i.e., $C(u) = C(v) = C'(w)$.\n6.  Let's check if this is a proper coloring for $G$:\n    *   If two vertices $x, y$ (neither being $u$ or $v$) are adjacent in $G$, they are also adjacent in $G'$, so $C'(x) \\neq C'(y)$, which means $C(x) \\neq C(y)$. This is valid.\n    *   If a vertex $x$ is adjacent to $u$ in $G$, then $x$ was adjacent to $w$ in $G'$. Thus, $C'(x) \\neq C'(w)$, which means $C(x) \\neq C(u)$. This is valid. The same logic applies if $x$ is adjacent to $v$.\n    *   Finally, consider the pair $u, v$. We assigned them the same color, $C(u) = C(v)$. This is valid because we chose $u$ and $v$ specifically because they are not adjacent in $G$.\n\nThis procedure successfully colors the graph $G$ using the colors from the coloring of $G'$, which used at most $n-1$ colors. Therefore, for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number satisfies $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\nFor $n=12345$, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\n**Part B: Showing the Bound is Tight**\n\nNow we need to show that this upper bound of $n-1$ can actually be achieved. We do this by constructing a specific graph $G$ that has $n$ vertices, is not complete, and has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n\nConsider the following graph $G$:\n*   Let $G$ be the graph formed by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding one more vertex, $v$, that is not connected to any of the other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n*   The total number of vertices in this graph is $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$.\n*   This graph $G$ is not a complete graph because the vertex $v$ is not connected to any other vertex.\n*   Let's find the chromatic number of this graph, $\\chi(G)$. The graph consists of two disconnected components: $K_{n-1}$ and the single vertex $v$ (which is a $K_1$). The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n    *   $\\chi(K_{n-1}) = n-1$.\n    *   $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{n-1}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(n-1, 1) = n-1$.\n\nFor $n=12345$, this graph requires $12345 - 1 = 12344$ colors.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Part A, we established that any graph $G$ on $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete needs at most $n-1=12344$ colors.\nFrom Part B, we established that there exists such a graph that needs exactly $n-1=12344$ colors.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors that we need to properly color the vertices of such a graph is $n-1$.\n\nSubstituting $n = 12345$:\nMaximum colors = $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
