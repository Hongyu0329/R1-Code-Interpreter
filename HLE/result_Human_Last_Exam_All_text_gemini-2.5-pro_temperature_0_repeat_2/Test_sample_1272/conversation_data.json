    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and the key figure.**\n*   **Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟):** A prominent military commander of the Chinese Ming Dynasty.\n*   **Historical Period:** Mu Sheng was heavily involved in the Ming campaigns in Đại Việt (Vietnam) in the early 15th century. This includes the initial invasion (Ming–Hồ War, 1406–1407) and the subsequent occupation and resistance, particularly the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427).\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint Mu Sheng's \"first major defeat\".**\n*   Mu Sheng was part of the successful Ming invasion in 1406-1407 that overthrew the Hồ dynasty. Therefore, his major defeat must have occurred later, during the Vietnamese resistance.\n*   The most significant resistance was the Lam Sơn uprising, led by Lê Lợi.\n*   In 1427, the Lam Sơn rebels had gained the upper hand and were besieging the main Ming fortress at Dongguan (modern Hanoi). The Ming emperor sent two large relief armies to save the situation.\n*   One army, led by Liu Sheng, came from Guangxi. The other, commanded by **Mu Sheng**, advanced from Yunnan.\n*   The Vietnamese strategy was to destroy these armies separately. The army of Liu Sheng was famously ambushed and annihilated at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang.\n*   Mu Sheng's army, advancing from the northwest, was intercepted by Vietnamese forces under the command of generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific battle and its location.**\n*   The Vietnamese forces blocked Mu Sheng's path at the passes of **Lãnh Câu (隘冷溝, Ải Lãnh Câu)** and **Đan Xá (丹舍隘, Ải Đan Xá)**.\n*   When Mu Sheng received news of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, the morale of his own troops collapsed. Facing a well-entrenched and determined Vietnamese force, and fearing a similar fate, Mu Sheng abandoned the relief mission and ordered a retreat back to Yunnan.\n*   This strategic failure—being stopped, forced into a retreat, and failing his objective—constituted his first and most significant defeat during the Lam Sơn war.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the modern-day location of the battle.**\n*   Historical research and Vietnamese historical records, such as the *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư*, place the battle site of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in the upper reaches of the Gâm River (Sông Gâm).\n*   This area corresponds to the territory of the modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province** in Vietnam. The passes were located in what is now the Chiêm Hóa District of Tuyên Quang.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **\"First\" Defeat:** It is crucial to distinguish his successful campaigns against the Hồ dynasty from his later failure against the Lam Sơn rebels. The 1427 campaign was his first major command to end in defeat.\n*   **\"Major\" Defeat:** While his army may have had smaller skirmishes before, the complete failure of the 1427 relief expedition was a decisive strategic defeat that sealed the fate of the Ming occupation.\n*   **Geographical Accuracy:** Historical place names must be accurately mapped to modern administrative divisions. Lãnh Câu is consistently identified by historians as being within today's Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe first major defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng occurred in 1427 when his relief army was halted at the Battle of Lãnh Câu and forced to retreat. This historical site is located in the current-day Tuyên Quang Province of Vietnam.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
