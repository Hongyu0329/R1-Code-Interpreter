    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the central pixel of the line from (1, 1) to (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Line and Setup the Algorithm\n\nFirst, we define the start and end points and calculate the change in x and y.\n\n*   Start point (x₁, y₁) = (1, 1)\n*   End point (x₂, y₂) = (11, 5)\n*   Calculate the change in x (dx): dx = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   Calculate the change in y (dy): dy = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n**Careful Point:** We need to determine which variable is the \"driving axis\". Since `dx` (10) is greater than `dy` (4), the x-axis is the driving axis. This means we will increment `x` by 1 in every step and decide whether to increment `y`.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize the Decision Parameter\n\nThe initial decision parameter `p` for this case (where 0 < slope < 1) is calculated as:\n`p = 2 * dy - dx`\n`p = 2 * 4 - 10`\n`p = 8 - 10 = -2`\n\n### Step 3: Iterate and Generate All Pixels\n\nWe start at (1, 1) and iterate `dx` (10) times to find all the pixels along the line.\n\n*   **Initial Pixel:** (1, 1)\n*   **Iteration 1:**\n    *   Current `p = -2`. Since `p < 0`, we only increment x.\n    *   Next pixel is (1+1, 1) = **(2, 1)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy = -2 + 2 * 4 = 6`.\n*   **Iteration 2:**\n    *   Current `p = 6`. Since `p >= 0`, we increment both x and y.\n    *   Next pixel is (2+1, 1+1) = **(3, 2)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n*   **Iteration 3:**\n    *   Current `p = -6`. Since `p < 0`, we only increment x.\n    *   Next pixel is (3+1, 2) = **(4, 2)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy = -6 + 8 = 2`.\n*   **Iteration 4:**\n    *   Current `p = 2`. Since `p >= 0`, we increment both x and y.\n    *   Next pixel is (4+1, 2+1) = **(5, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n*   **Iteration 5:**\n    *   Current `p = -10`. Since `p < 0`, we only increment x.\n    *   Next pixel is (5+1, 3) = **(6, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy = -10 + 8 = -2`.\n*   **Iteration 6:**\n    *   Current `p = -2`. Since `p < 0`, we only increment x.\n    *   Next pixel is (6+1, 3) = **(7, 3)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy = -2 + 8 = 6`.\n*   **Iteration 7:**\n    *   Current `p = 6`. Since `p >= 0`, we increment both x and y.\n    *   Next pixel is (7+1, 3+1) = **(8, 4)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n*   **Iteration 8:**\n    *   Current `p = -6`. Since `p < 0`, we only increment x.\n    *   Next pixel is (8+1, 4) = **(9, 4)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy = -6 + 8 = 2`.\n*   **Iteration 9:**\n    *   Current `p = 2`. Since `p >= 0`, we increment both x and y.\n    *   Next pixel is (9+1, 4+1) = **(10, 5)**.\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n*   **Iteration 10:**\n    *   Current `p = -10`. Since `p < 0`, we only increment x.\n    *   Next pixel is (10+1, 5) = **(11, 5)**. This is the end point.\n\n### Step 4: List All Pixels and Find the Center\n\nLet's list all the pixels generated in order:\n1.  (1, 1)\n2.  (2, 1)\n3.  (3, 2)\n4.  (4, 2)\n5.  (5, 3)\n6.  **(6, 3)**\n7.  (7, 3)\n8.  (8, 4)\n9.  (9, 4)\n10. (10, 5)\n11. (11, 5)\n\n**Careful Point:** The total number of pixels is `dx + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11`. Since 11 is an odd number, there is a single central pixel. The position of the central pixel is `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6`.\n\nThe 6th pixel in our generated list is **(6, 3)**.\n\n**Alternative Check (Midpoint Method):**\nA quick way to find the center is to calculate the geometric midpoint of the line segment:\n*   Midpoint x = (x₁ + x₂) / 2 = (1 + 11) / 2 = 6\n*   Midpoint y = (y₁ + y₂) / 2 = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3\nThe geometric midpoint is (6, 3). Since this results in integer coordinates, it corresponds directly to a pixel, which will be the central pixel. This confirms our result from the step-by-step algorithm.\n\nThe central pixel is (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
