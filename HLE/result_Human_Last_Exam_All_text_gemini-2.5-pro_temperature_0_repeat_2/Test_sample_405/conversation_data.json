    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Terms**\n*   **Allotropes:** These are different structural modifications of an element. The atoms of the element are bonded together in different manners. These different structures result in different physical and chemical properties, including color.\n*   **Pure Allotropes:** We are looking for the colors of the distinct, pure forms of phosphorus, not colors that arise from impurities, mixtures, or degradation.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Main Allotropes of Phosphorus and Their Colors**\nWe need to list the well-established allotropes of phosphorus and identify the color of each in its pure state.\n\n1.  **White Phosphorus (P₄)**\n    *   **Structure:** It consists of individual tetrahedral P₄ molecules.\n    *   **Color:** In its pure form, white phosphorus is a colorless or **white** waxy solid.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is often called \"yellow phosphorus\" because it rapidly turns yellow upon exposure to light. This yellow color is due to the formation of small amounts of red phosphorus, so it is not the color of the *pure* allotrope. Therefore, we count the color **white**.\n\n2.  **Red Phosphorus**\n    *   **Structure:** It has a polymeric, amorphous (non-crystalline) structure.\n    *   **Color:** As the name suggests, its color is **red**. The exact shade can vary from orange-red to dark red depending on its preparation and particle size. The fundamental color is red.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Some sources mention \"scarlet phosphorus,\" but this is generally considered a finely divided form of red phosphorus, not a distinct allotrope.\n\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a crystalline, polymeric form of phosphorus with a complex monoclinic structure.\n    *   **Color:** It consists of deep **violet** or purple crystals.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Although related to red phosphorus, its distinct crystalline structure and unique color mean it is treated as a separate allotrope.\n\n4.  **Black Phosphorus**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus. It has a layered, puckered structure similar to graphite.\n    *   **Color:** It is a **black** solid with a metallic luster, and it is a semiconductor.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the Distinct Colors**\nBased on the analysis of the four main, well-characterized allotropes of phosphorus, we have identified the following distinct colors for the pure forms:\n1.  **White** (from White Phosphorus)\n2.  **Red** (from Red Phosphorus)\n3.  **Violet** (from Violet Phosphorus)\n4.  **Black** (from Black Phosphorus)\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\nBy counting the unique colors from the list above, we find there are four different colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus. Newer, less common forms like 2D \"blue phosphorus\" are not typically considered in this context as they are not stable bulk materials with an easily observable macroscopic color.\n\nThe final answer is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
