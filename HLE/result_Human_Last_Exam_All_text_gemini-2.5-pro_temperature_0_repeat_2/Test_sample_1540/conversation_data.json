    "An analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient C solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The core task is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring the case of the letters. The strings are guaranteed to have the same length. The output should be -1, 1, or 0, representing the relationship (less than, greater than, or equal).\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Logic:**\n    *   Lexicographical comparison means checking characters from left to right.\n    *   The comparison stops at the first position where the characters differ.\n    *   \"Case-insensitive\" means we must treat 'a' and 'A' as the same character for comparison. A standard way to do this is to convert both characters being compared to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase) before the comparison. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is perfect for this.\n\n3.  **Consider a Standard (but not most memory-efficient) Approach:**\n    *   A straightforward way is to read both strings into two separate character arrays.\n    *   `char s1[101];`\n    *   `char s2[101];` (The size is 101 to accommodate a string of length 100 plus the null terminator `\\0`).\n    *   Then, loop from `i = 0` to the end of the strings, comparing `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(s2[i])`.\n    *   **Memory Usage:** This would require `101` bytes for `s1`, `101` bytes for `s2`, and at least `4` bytes for a loop counter `int i`. Total: `101 + 101 + 4 = 206` bytes. We can do better.\n\n4.  **Optimize for Memory Efficiency:**\n    *   The main source of memory usage is the two buffers for the strings. The key question is: can we avoid using one of them?\n    *   The input is sequential: the first string is provided, followed by a newline, then the second string.\n    *   To compare the i-th character of string 1 with the i-th character of string 2, we must have the i-th character of string 1 available when we read the i-th character of string 2.\n    *   This means we *must* read and store the entire first string in memory. A buffer for the first string is unavoidable.\n    *   However, we do *not* need to store the entire second string. We can read it one character at a time and perform the comparison on the fly against the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n\n5.  **The Most Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    1.  Declare a character array (buffer) to store the first string. Its size must be 101 to handle the maximum length of 100 plus the null terminator. `char s1[101];`\n    2.  Read the first string from the input into this buffer. `scanf(\"%s\", s1);` is suitable.\n    3.  The `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` function leaves the newline character (`\\n`) in the input buffer. We must consume this character before we start reading the second string. A simple `getchar();` will do this.\n    4.  Declare an integer variable to act as an index for the first string's buffer. `int i = 0;`\n    5.  Declare a single character variable to hold the characters of the second string as we read them. `char c2;`\n    6.  Loop, reading one character at a time from the input for the second string. The loop continues until a newline is encountered.\n    7.  Inside the loop, compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(c2)`.\n    8.  If `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)`, the first string is smaller. Print \"-1\" and terminate.\n    9.  If `tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)`, the first string is larger. Print \"1\" and terminate.\n    10. If they are equal, increment the index `i` and continue to the next character.\n    11. If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal. Print \"0\".\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Buffer Size:** A string of length `L` requires a character array of size `L+1` in C to store the null terminator. Since the max length is 100, the buffer must be size 101.\n*   **Input Handling:** `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` stops at whitespace. The newline after the first string remains in the input stream and must be consumed before reading the second string character by character with `getchar()`.\n*   **Data Type Sizes:** For calculating memory, we assume standard sizes on competitive programming platforms: `char` is 1 byte and `int` is 4 bytes.\n*   **Guarantees:** The problem guarantees the strings are the same length, which simplifies the logic. We don't need to handle cases where one string is a prefix of the other.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the most memory-efficient algorithm, we calculate the total memory used for variables (`m`).\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory = 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 byte = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **Index for the buffer:** `int i;`\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n3.  **Variable for the second string's characters:** `char c2;`\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 4 + 1 = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
