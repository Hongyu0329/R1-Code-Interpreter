    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n**1. Understand the Object of Study**\n*   `C`: A compact Riemann surface of genus `g=3`. This is equivalent to a smooth complex projective algebraic curve of genus 3.\n*   `X = C^(15)`: The 15th symmetric power of `C`. Its points are effective divisors of degree 15 on `C`. `X` is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   Néron-Severi group `NS(X)`: The group of divisors on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   Rank of `NS(X)`: This is the Picard number of `X`, denoted `ρ(X)`. We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(X)` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**2. Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Curve C**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to relate the Picard number of the symmetric power `X = C^(n)` to the properties of the curve `C` itself.\n\n*   **The Abel-Jacobi Map:** There is a fundamental map `u: C^(n) -> J(C)`, called the Abel-Jacobi map, where `J(C)` is the Jacobian of `C`. The Jacobian `J(C)` is a `g`-dimensional abelian variety (specifically, a principally polarized abelian variety) that parameterizes degree 0 line bundles on `C`.\n*   **Cohomology:** The structure of the cohomology of `C^(n)` is well-understood. The second cohomology group with rational coefficients, `H^2(C^(n), Q)`, which contains the classes of divisors, is given by:\n    `H^2(C^(n), Q) ≅ Q⋅W ⊕ Λ^2 H^1(C, Q)`\n    Here, `W` is the cohomology class of the divisor `C^(n-1)` naturally embedded in `C^(n)` (by adding a fixed point of `C` to each divisor). The second summand, `Λ^2 H^1(C, Q)`, is isomorphic via the pullback `u^*` to the second cohomology group of the Jacobian, `H^2(J(C), Q)`.\n*   **Algebraic Cycles:** The Néron-Severi group `NS(X)` consists of algebraic cycles. The rank `ρ(X)` is the dimension of the Q-vector space spanned by these cycles inside `H^2(X, Q)`.\n    *   The class `W` is always algebraic.\n    *   The algebraic classes in the second summand `Λ^2 H^1(C, Q)` are precisely the pullbacks of the algebraic classes from `J(C)`.\n*   **The Key Formula:** The space of algebraic 1-cycles on `X` is the direct sum of the space generated by `W` and the space of algebraic 1-cycles on `J(C)`. Taking dimensions, we get a crucial formula for the Picard number:\n    `ρ(C^(n)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n    This formula holds for `n ≥ g`. In our case, `n=15` and `g=3`, so the condition is satisfied. The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\n**3. Find the Smallest Possible Rank of NS(J(C))**\n\n*   The rank `ρ(J(C))` depends on the endomorphism algebra of `J(C)`.\n*   For a **generic** curve `C` of genus `g`, its Jacobian `J(C)` has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, `End(J(C)) = Z`. These are just the trivial endomorphisms (multiplication by an integer).\n*   In this case, the Néron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is generated by a single element, the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n*   Therefore, for a generic genus 3 curve, `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n*   Since such generic curves exist (they form a dense open subset of the moduli space of genus 3 curves), the minimum possible rank is 1.\n*   **Smallest `ρ(J(C)) = 1`**.\n\n**4. Find the Largest Possible Rank of NS(J(C))**\n\n*   Finding the maximum Picard number for the Jacobian of a curve of a given genus is a difficult problem in general. This requires finding a special curve `C` whose Jacobian `J(C)` has a large ring of endomorphisms (e.g., a curve with Complex Multiplication or Real Multiplication).\n*   The theoretical maximum for the Picard number of any 3-dimensional abelian variety is `g^2 = 3^2 = 9`.\n*   However, not all abelian varieties are Jacobians of curves. The condition of being a Jacobian imposes strong constraints. In particular, a principally polarized abelian variety of odd dimension `g` that is isogenous to the `g`-th power of a CM elliptic curve (which would be required to reach the maximum `ρ = g^2`) cannot exist. Thus, `ρ(J(C))` cannot be 9.\n*   We must rely on known results for maximal Picard numbers of Jacobians. The record for genus 3 is held by the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`.\n*   It is a well-established, albeit highly non-trivial, result in algebraic geometry that the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic has a Néron-Severi rank of 7.\n*   This value is believed to be the maximum possible for any genus 3 curve.\n*   **Largest `ρ(J(C)) = 7`**.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we substitute the minimum and maximum values of `ρ(J(C))` into our formula for `ρ(X)`.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:**\n    `ρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Largest Rank:**\n    `ρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(J(C)) = 1 + 7 = 8`\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest is 8.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 8.>>>"
