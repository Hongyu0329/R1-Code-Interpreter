    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core subject of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific fictional character from a specific episode of the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the specific episode and event.**\nThe episode is \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". The event within the episode is the Junior prom.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the nature of the \"performer\".**\nThe question specifies that the performer is a \"cardboard cutout\". This is a crucial detail, as it's a comedic element and not a live performance by an animated character.\n\n**Step 4: Recall or research the events of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nIn this episode, the Teen Girl Squad attends their Junior Prom. An announcer introduces the musical entertainment for the evening.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the name announced.**\nThe announcer says, \"And now, performing their hit single, 'Not Having a Face,' it's... a cardboard cutout of... **Kasio-Toro**!\"\n\n**Step 6: Cross-reference the name and visual.**\nA cardboard cutout of a male singer with spiky hair and a keytar is shown on the stage.
