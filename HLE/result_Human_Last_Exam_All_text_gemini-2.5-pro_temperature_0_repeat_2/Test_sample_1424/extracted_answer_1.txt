The bare Green's function $G_0$ has an inverse linear dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$. Specifically, in frequency-momentum (or frequency-eigenstate) space, the Green's function takes the form $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta}$, where $\omega$ is the frequency. Thus, $G_0$ is proportional to $(\text{constant} - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$. The single-particle energies $\epsilon_k$ are the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function.
