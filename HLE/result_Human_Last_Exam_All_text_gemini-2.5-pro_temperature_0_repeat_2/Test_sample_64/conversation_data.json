    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\nThe word is the kanji 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing in Japanese. Let's break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n*   お (o) - 1 mora\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\n*   う (u) - 1 mora (This is the long vowel part of とう)\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\nTotal morae = 4.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the different pitch accent patterns.**\nJapanese pitch accent describes how the pitch of the voice changes over the morae of a word. The main patterns are:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式, [0])**: The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high through the rest of the word and onto any following particle (e.g., が, を).\n    *   Example: はな (hana, flower) -> は(L)な(H)が(H)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式, [1])**: The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae, including any following particle.\n    *   Example: はし (hashi, chopsticks) -> は(H)し(L)が(L)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式, [n])**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high, and then drops on a specific mora *within* the word. The following particle is low. 'n' indicates the mora *before* the drop.\n    *   Example: こころ (kokoro, heart) is [3] -> こ(L)こ(H)ろ(H)が(L) -> The drop is after the 3rd mora, but since the word only has 3 morae, it's technically Odaka. A better example: みずうみ (mizuumi, lake) is [3] -> み(L)ず(H)う(H)み(L)が(L).\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式, [n])**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. 'n' is equal to the total number of morae.\n    *   Example: はし (hashi, bridge) is [2] -> は(L)し(H)が(L)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the pitch accent of 「弟」 (おとうと).**\nTo find the standard pitch accent, we consult a Japanese accent dictionary (like the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary).\n*   The standard Tokyo accent for 「おとうと」 is marked as [0].\n*   The [0] notation corresponds to the **Heiban (平板)** pattern.\n*   Let's apply the Heiban pattern to the 4-mora word 「おとうと」:\n    *   The pitch starts low on the first mora: お (L)\n    *   It rises on the second mora and stays high: と(H)う(H)と(H)\n    *   If a particle like 「が」 is attached, the particle also remains high: が(H)\n    *   The full pattern is: お(L)と(H)う(H)と(H)が(H).\n\n**Step 5: Match the pattern to the answer choices.**\nThe pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Heiban. This corresponds to answer choice A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
