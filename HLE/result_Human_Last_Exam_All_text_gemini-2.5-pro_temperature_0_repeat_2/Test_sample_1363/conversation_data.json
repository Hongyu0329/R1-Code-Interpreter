    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** This is a standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple rotates to the left. The specific number of steps and the amount of rotation are defined by the dance's syllabus.\n*   **Overturn:** This means to rotate more than the standard amount prescribed for the figure. For example, if a figure is supposed to turn 3/4 of a full circle, overturning it would mean turning a full circle or more.\n*   **Disregarding the Technique:** This is the most crucial part of the question. It means breaking the fundamental rules that define the character of a specific dance. These rules include footwork (heel/toe leads), rise and fall, body sway, Contra Body Movement (CBM), and the overall quality of movement (e.g., smooth vs. staccato).\n*   **The Question's Core Logic:** We are looking for a dance where the very actions required to create extra rotation (to overturn the turn) are explicitly forbidden by the dance's core technique. In other words, the technique itself creates a hard limit on the amount of turn possible.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Dance Style's Technique in Relation to Turning**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz & B. English Waltz:** These are \"swing\" dances. They are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, body sway, and a pronounced rise and fall. Dancers use the momentum generated by the swing and the \"up\" phase of the rise and fall to help them rotate. By exaggerating the sway and using the body's momentum skillfully, a dancer can increase the amount of rotation, thus overturning the turn. This is a common practice in advanced choreography and does not necessarily \"disregard\" the technique; rather, it's an advanced application of it.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot & E. Quickstep:** Like the Waltzes, these are also swing dances. They rely on smooth, continuous movement, sway, and rise and fall to create their character. The principles for turning are similar. The energy and momentum inherent in the dance can be harnessed to produce more rotation than the standard amount. Overturning figures is a key part of creating dynamic and floor-craft-savvy choreography in these dances.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the other four dances. Its technique is built on a set of \"negative\" rules that directly contradict the principles of swing dances.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers maintain a constant level, moving with bent knees. There is no \"up\" phase to help with rotation.\n    *   **No Sway:** The body is held strong and still from side to side. You cannot use body sway to generate momentum for a turn.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** The movement is sharp, clipped, and dramatic, not smooth and flowing.\n    *   **Grounded Movement:** The feet are kept close to the floor, with a \"no daylight\" principle. There is no \"swinging\" of the legs or body through the air.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Analysis to Find the Answer**\n\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), the tools used to create a turn (sway, rise, momentum) are the same tools that can be used to *increase* that turn. Therefore, overturning is possible within the bounds of the technique.\n\nIn the European Tango, the tools needed to create extra rotation (sway, rise, swing) are explicitly forbidden. The turn in a Tango Reverse Turn is created mechanically through precise foot placement and a sharp, contained rotation of the body frame. To force more turn, a dancer would have to introduce sway, lift their body (rise), or swing their leg, all of which would be a clear violation and disregard for the fundamental technique of the Tango. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango reverse turn *without* disregarding the technique.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe European Tango is the only dance on the list where the core technical principles make it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without breaking those very principles.\n\n<<<C>>>"
