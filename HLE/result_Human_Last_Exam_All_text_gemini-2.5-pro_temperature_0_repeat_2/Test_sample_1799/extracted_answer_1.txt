No, the 2nd postulate is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first. The first postulate states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, but it does not specify what those laws are or what the transformation between frames must be. One could imagine a universe that obeys the first postulate but is governed by Galilean relativity, where there is no universal speed limit. The second postulate introduces a crucial piece of new, empirical information: that there exists a finite invariant speed, and this speed is the speed of light. This second postulate is what uniquely selects the Lorentz transformations over the Galilean ones and forms the complete basis for special relativity.
