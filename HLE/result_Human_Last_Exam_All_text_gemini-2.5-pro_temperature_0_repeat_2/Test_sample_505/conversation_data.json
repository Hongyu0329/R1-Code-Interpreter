    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Logical Qubit Encoding in Surface Codes**\n\nIn topological surface codes, logical qubits are not stored in individual physical qubits but are encoded in the global, topological properties of the 2D lattice of physical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is laid out. The key topological features are its genus (the number of \"handles,\" like in a donut) and the number of boundaries (or holes).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code**\n\n*   A \"patch\" of surface code typically refers to a code on a simple, flat plane. Topologically, this is a surface with genus `g=0`.\n*   A standard planar patch with no holes has one outer boundary. It can encode **one** logical qubit.\n*   Introducing holes (also called defects or punctures) into the patch creates new, internal boundaries. These new boundaries can be used to define additional logical operators.\n*   The number of logical qubits, `k`, that can be encoded on a single connected surface is given by the formula:\n    `k = 2g + b - 1`\n    where `g` is the genus and `b` is the number of distinct boundaries.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Logical Qubits for One Patch with Two Holes**\n\n*   For a single patch, we assume it's on a plane, so the genus `g = 0`.\n*   The patch has **two holes**. Each hole creates an inner boundary. There is also the main outer boundary of the patch itself.\n*   Therefore, the total number of boundaries `b` is `1 (outer) + 2 (holes) = 3`.\n*   Now, we apply the formula:\n    `k = 2 * g + b - 1`\n    `k = 2 * 0 + 3 - 1`\n    `k = 2`\n*   So, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode **2 logical qubits**.\n*   *Alternative Viewpoint:* For a planar code (`g=0`), the number of logical qubits is simply equal to the number of holes, `k=h`. With `h=2`, we get `k=2`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Logical Qubits for Two Separate Patches**\n\n*   The problem specifies **two patches** of surface code. We assume these patches are physically and logically separate (i.e., not connected).\n*   The phrasing \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" is most naturally interpreted as each patch having two holes.\n*   Since the patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n*   Qubits from Patch 1: As calculated in Step 3, this is 2 logical qubits.\n*   Qubits from Patch 2: This patch is identical, so it also encodes 2 logical qubits.\n*   Total logical qubits = (Qubits from Patch 1) + (Qubits from Patch 2)\n*   Total logical qubits = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrasing \"two patches ... with two holes\" is interpreted to mean each patch has two holes. If it meant a total of two holes distributed between the patches, the maximum would be 3 (one patch with two holes and one with zero holes). The chosen interpretation is the most standard reading of the grammar.\n2.  **Topology of a \"Patch\":** It is standard to assume a \"patch\" refers to a planar code (genus `g=0`), as opposed to a toric code (`g=1`), unless specified otherwise.\n3.  **Independence of Patches:** The calculation assumes the two patches are completely separate. If they were connected, they would form a single, more complex topological surface, and the calculation would change.\n4.  **Formula Application:** The formula `k = 2g + b - 1` is a general and reliable way to determine the number of logical qubits from the surface's topology. It's crucial to correctly identify the genus `g` and the number of boundaries `b`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  A single patch with two holes is a planar surface (`g=0`) with three boundaries (1 outer, 2 inner).\n2.  Number of logical qubits in one patch: `k_1 = 2*0 + 3 - 1 = 2`.\n3.  The system has two such independent patches.\n4.  Total number of logical qubits: `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n<<<4>>>"
