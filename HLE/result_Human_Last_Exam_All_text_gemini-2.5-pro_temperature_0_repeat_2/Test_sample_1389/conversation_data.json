    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Vaccine Model: All-or-Nothing**\n    *   An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine provides perfect protection to a certain fraction of the vaccinated population, while providing no protection to the rest.\n    *   Let `p` be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are perfectly protected (100% immune).\n    *   The remaining proportion, `1-p`, of vaccinated individuals receives no protection and remains as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n\n2.  **Define Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_pe)**\n    *   `VE_pe` is the proportional reduction in the risk of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen.\n    *   For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the effect is not uniform across all vaccinated individuals. We must consider the *average* per-exposure efficacy for the entire vaccinated group.\n    *   For the protected fraction `p`, the reduction in risk is 100%, so their individual `VE_pe` is 1.\n    *   For the unprotected fraction `1-p`, the reduction in risk is 0%, so their individual `VE_pe` is 0.\n    *   The average `VE_pe` for the vaccinated group is the weighted average of these two outcomes:\n        `VE_pe = (p * 1) + ((1-p) * 0) = p`\n    *   So, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the per-exposure efficacy is equal to the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\n3.  **Define the Estimator: 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (1 - IRR)**\n    *   The Incidence Rate (IR) is the number of new cases per unit of person-time at risk.\n    *   The Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR`) is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`).\n        `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`\n    *   The quantity we are evaluating is `1 - IRR`, which is the standard formula for calculating vaccine efficacy from trial data (`VE_IR`).\n        `VE_IR = 1 - IRR = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Incidence Rate in Each Group**\n    *   Let `IR_u` be the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. This rate reflects the baseline risk of infection in the population.\n    *   The vaccinated group is a mixture:\n        *   The protected fraction `p` has an incidence rate of 0.\n        *   The unprotected fraction `1-p` has an incidence rate equal to that of the unvaccinated group, `IR_u`.\n    *   The overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group (`IR_v`) is the weighted average of the rates of its subgroups:\n        `IR_v = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * IR_u) = (1-p) * IR_u`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Value of the Estimator (1 - IRR)**\n    *   Now, substitute the expression for `IR_v` into the `1 - IRR` formula:\n        `1 - IRR = 1 - ( ((1-p) * IR_u) / IR_u )`\n    *   The `IR_u` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out:\n        `1 - IRR = 1 - (1-p)`\n    *   Simplifying the expression gives:\n        `1 - IRR = p`\n\n6.  **Compare the Estimator to the True Value**\n    *   From Step 2, we determined that the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_pe`) is `p`.\n    *   From Step 5, we calculated that the value of the estimator (`1 - IRR`) is also `p`.\n    *   Since `1 - IRR = VE_pe`, the estimator `1 - IRR` **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Model Assumption:** This analysis relies on the \"all-or-nothing\" model being the true mechanism of the vaccine.\n*   **Average Efficacy:** The term \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" for a heterogeneous-response vaccine like this refers to the average efficacy across the entire vaccinated group.\n*   **Constant Hazard:** The derivation assumes that the force of infection (and thus the incidence rate in the unvaccinated, `IR_u`) is constant over the follow-up period.\n*   **No Confounding:** It is assumed that the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are comparable in all other respects that might affect the risk of infection (e.g., age, behavior, underlying health conditions).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the value calculated from `1 - IRR` is exactly equal to the average per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`p`). Therefore, it provides a correct estimate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
