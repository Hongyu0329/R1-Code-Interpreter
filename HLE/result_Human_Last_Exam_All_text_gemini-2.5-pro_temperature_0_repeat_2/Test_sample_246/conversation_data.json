    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the manifold in question.**\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot in $S^3$. The 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, denoted $\\Sigma = \\tau_5(K)$, is a knotted 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere $S^4$. The manifold we are interested in, let's call it $M$, is the 2-fold branched cover of $S^4$ with branching set $\\Sigma$. This manifold $M$ is a closed, orientable 4-manifold. The question asks for the minimal number of generators of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(M)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the manifold to a fibration.**\nA key property of a twist-spun knot $\\tau_n(K)$ is that its complement, $S^4 \\setminus \\tau_n(K)$, fibers over the circle $S^1$. Let's denote this fibration by $p: S^4 \\setminus \\Sigma \\to S^1$.\nThe fiber of this fibration is homeomorphic to the exterior of the original knot, $X_K = S^3 \\setminus N(K)$, where $N(K)$ is a tubular neighborhood of $K$. The monodromy of this fibration is the $n$-th power of the Dehn twist homeomorphism of $X_K$ along its boundary torus. For our case, $n=5$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the fibration structure to analyze the branched cover.**\nThe double branched cover $M$ can be constructed using this fibration. The manifold $M$ itself fibers over $S^1$. This is a standard result in the theory of branched covers of fibered knots. The fibration of $M$ is induced by the fibration of the complement of $\\Sigma$.\nThe fiber of the fibration of $M$ is the double branched cover of the fiber of $p$. The fiber of $p$ is the knot exterior $X_K$. The double branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot $K$ is the lens space $L(3,1)$. So, the fiber of the fibration of $M$ is the lens space $L(3,1)$.\nThe monodromy of the fibration of $M$ is a lift of the monodromy of the fibration of $S^4 \\setminus \\Sigma$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the fundamental group of the manifold.**\nSince $M$ fibers over $S^1$ with fiber $Y=L(3,1)$ and some monodromy homeomorphism $h: Y \\to Y$, its fundamental group can be expressed as a semidirect product:\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(Y) \\rtimes_{h_*} \\mathbb{Z}$\nwhere $h_*: \\pi_1(Y) \\to \\pi_1(Y)$ is the automorphism induced by the monodromy $h$.\n\nWe know that $\\pi_1(Y) = \\pi_1(L(3,1)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nThe automorphism group of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is $\\text{Aut}(\\mathbb{Z}_3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The two possible automorphisms are the identity ($g \\mapsto g$) and inversion ($g \\mapsto g^{-1}$).\n\nThe monodromy of the complement of the $n$-twist-spun knot is the $n$-th power of a Dehn twist. The lift of this monodromy to the double branched cover induces an automorphism on the fundamental group of the fiber. It is a known result that for an $n$-twist spin, the induced automorphism $h_*$ is the identity if $n$ is even, and it is the inversion map if $n$ is odd.\nIn our case, $n=5$, which is odd. Therefore, the induced automorphism is inversion.\nSo, $h_*(g) = g^{-1}$ for all $g \\in \\pi_1(L(3,1)) = \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nLet $\\pi_1(L(3,1)) = \\langle a \\mid a^3 = 1 \\rangle$. The fundamental group of $M$ is:\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\rtimes_{-1} \\mathbb{Z}$\nThis group has the presentation:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, t \\mid a^3 = 1, tat^{-1} = a^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the minimal number of generators for this group.**\nLet $G = \\pi_1(M)$. The presentation $\\langle a, t \\mid a^3=1, tat^{-1}=a^{-1} \\rangle$ shows that $G$ can be generated by two elements, $\\{a, t\\}$. Therefore, the minimal number of generators, denoted $d(G)$, is at most 2, i.e., $d(G) \\le 2$.\n\nTo show that $d(G)$ is not 1, we can check if the group is cyclic. A group is cyclic if and only if it can be generated by a single element. All cyclic groups are abelian. Let's check if $G$ is abelian.\nThe group $G$ is abelian if $at = ta$.\nThe relation is $tat^{-1} = a^{-1}$, which can be written as $ta = a^{-1}t$.\nIf $at = ta$, then $at = a^{-1}t$. This implies $a = a^{-1}$, or $a^2=1$.\nHowever, the group has an element $a$ of order 3 ($a^3=1$). If $a^2=1$ and $a^3=1$, then $a=a^3(a^2)^{-1}=1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. If $a=1$, the relation $tat^{-1}=a^{-1}$ becomes trivial, and the group would be $\\langle t \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. But the group contains a non-trivial subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\nThe only element satisfying $a^2=1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is the identity. Since $a$ is a generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, $a$ is not the identity. Thus, $at \\neq ta$, and the group $G$ is not abelian.\n\nSince $G$ is not abelian, it cannot be cyclic. Therefore, it cannot be generated by a single element. This means $d(G) > 1$.\n\nCombining our findings:\n1. $d(G) \\le 2$\n2. $d(G) > 1$\n\nThe only integer satisfying these conditions is 2. Thus, the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group is 2."
