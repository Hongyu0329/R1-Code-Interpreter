    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid, where movement is restricted to one unit step up, down, left, or right. From a point (x, y), one can move to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of n moves on the lattice, starting from a fixed origin, say (0,0).\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point (lattice vertex) more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating for Small Values of n**\n\nLet's calculate the first few terms of the sequence a(n) to understand the process.\n\n*   **a(1):** From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible first steps: Right, Left, Up, Down. All are self-avoiding.\n    *   a(1) = 4\n\n*   **a(2):** We start with one of the 4 initial steps. For the second step, we can move in any direction except back to the origin. This leaves 3 choices for the second step.\n    *   Total walks = (Choices for 1st step) × (Choices for 2nd step) = 4 × 3 = 12.\n    *   a(2) = 12\n\n*   **a(3):** For a 3-step walk, it is impossible to revisit a point other than the one you just came from. For example, if you walk East then North, you are at (1,1). You cannot return to (1,0), but the other three directions (East, North, West) are all valid and lead to new points. This holds for any 2-step walk.\n    *   Therefore, for each of the 12 valid 2-step walks, there are 3 valid choices for the third step.\n    *   Total walks = a(2) × 3 = 12 × 3 = 36.\n    *   a(3) = 36\n\n**Step 3: Recognizing the Complexity for Larger n**\n\n*   **a(4):** The simple multiplication pattern breaks down starting with n=4. This is because the walk can now form a square and return to a previously visited point (other than the immediate predecessor).\n    *   Consider the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1).\n    *   For the 4th step from (0,1), the possible moves are to (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), and (0,0).\n    *   The move to (1,1) is forbidden as it's the immediate predecessor.\n    *   The move to (0,0) is also forbidden because it's a previously visited point (the origin).\n    *   This means there are only 2 valid choices for the 4th step, not 3.\n*   This self-intersection possibility makes direct calculation very complex. There is no known simple closed-form formula for a(n).\n\n**Step 4: Using Known Computed Values**\n\nSince there is no simple formula, the values of a(n) are found through computational enumeration (essentially, having a computer try all possible paths and count the valid ones). This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and statistical physics, and the sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nWe can list the known values for a(n):\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the established and computationally verified sequence for the number of self-avoiding walks on a square lattice, the value for a 10-step walk is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
