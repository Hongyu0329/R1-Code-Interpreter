    "This problem requires us to compute the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. We will solve this by using the product formula for simplicial volume and the known formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Product Formula for Simplicial Volume**\n\nThe simplicial volume is a topological invariant of a manifold. A key property is how it behaves with respect to products. For two closed, oriented, connected manifolds $M$ and $N$ with dimensions $m = \\dim(M)$ and $n = \\dim(N)$, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by the formula:\n$||M \\times N|| = C_{m+n}^m \\cdot ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$\nwhere $C_{k}^l = \\frac{k!}{l!(k-l)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n\nIn our case, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   The dimension of $\\Sigma_{31}$ is $m=2$.\n*   The dimension of $\\Sigma_{17}$ is $n=2$.\n\nSo, the dimension of the product manifold $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is $m+n = 4$. The binomial coefficient is:\n$C_{2+2}^2 = C_4^2 = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the product formula for our specific problem is:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}||$.\n\n**Step 2: The Simplicial Volume of a Surface $\\Sigma_g$**\n\nNext, we need to compute the simplicial volume of the individual surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$, denoted $\\Sigma_g$, is a well-known result:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = \\max(0, 4(g-1))$.\n\nLet's analyze this formula:\n*   If $g=0$, $\\Sigma_0$ is the sphere $S^2$. $||\\Sigma_0|| = 4(0-1) = -4$, so we take $\\max(0, -4) = 0$.\n*   If $g=1$, $\\Sigma_1$ is the torus $T^2$. $||\\Sigma_1|| = 4(1-1) = 0$.\n*   If $g \\ge 2$, the surface $\\Sigma_g$ admits a hyperbolic metric. Its simplicial volume is non-zero and is given by $4(g-1)$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The vanishing of the simplicial volume for the sphere and the torus is a crucial detail. It is because their fundamental groups are amenable. For $g \\ge 2$, the fundamental group is non-amenable, and the surface is hyperbolic. For a closed hyperbolic surface, the simplicial volume is proportional to its Riemannian volume: $||\\Sigma_g|| = \\frac{\\text{vol}(\\Sigma_g)}{\\pi}$. By the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the volume of a hyperbolic surface is $\\text{vol}(\\Sigma_g) = -2\\pi \\chi(\\Sigma_g) = -2\\pi(2-2g) = 4\\pi(g-1)$. Thus, $||\\Sigma_g|| = \\frac{4\\pi(g-1)}{\\pi} = 4(g-1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Simplicial Volumes of $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$**\n\nWe apply the formula from Step 2 to our specific surfaces.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g=31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, we have:\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g=17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, we have:\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Final Answer**\n\nNow we substitute the values from Step 3 into the product formula from Step 1.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}||$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n$6 \\times 120 = 720$\n$720 \\times 64 = 46080$\n\nSo, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46080.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{46080}$.\n<<<46080>>>"
