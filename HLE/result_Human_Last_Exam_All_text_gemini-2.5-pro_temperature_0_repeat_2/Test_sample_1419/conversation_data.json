    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Theory and the Coupling Constant**\n\nThe theory in question is the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory, described by a Lagrangian density in $d$ Euclidean dimensions:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{u}{4!} \\phi^4 $$\nWe are interested in the behavior of this theory near four dimensions, so we use dimensional regularization and set $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Dimensionality of the Coupling Constant**\nThe action $S = \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ must be dimensionless. From the kinetic term, we can deduce the mass dimension of the field $\\phi$ to be $[\\phi] = (d-2)/2$. For the interaction term $\\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4$ to have the same dimension as the Lagrangian density ($[\\mathcal{L}]=d$), the coupling constant $u$ must have a mass dimension:\n$$ [u] = d - 4[\\phi] = d - 4\\left(\\frac{d-2}{2}\\right) = d - 2(d-2) = 4-d $$\nSubstituting $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, we find the mass dimension of the coupling constant $u$ is $[u] = \\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Renormalization Group (RG) Equation (Beta Function)**\n\nThe beta function, $\\beta(u)$, describes how the coupling constant $u$ changes with the renormalization energy scale $\\mu$. It is defined as:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} $$\nThe beta function can be determined by analyzing how the theory changes under a change of scale. It consists of two parts:\n\n1.  **The \"classical\" or \"engineering\" contribution:** This arises directly from the mass dimension of the coupling constant. Since $u$ has a mass dimension of $\\epsilon$, it must scale with $\\mu$ to keep physical quantities scale-independent. This contribution to the beta function is $-\\epsilon u$.\n2.  **The \"quantum\" contribution:** This arises from loop corrections in the quantum theory, which introduce their own scale dependence. For $\\phi^4$ theory, the leading quantum correction comes from one-loop diagrams.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Structure of the Beta Function**\nThe full beta function is the sum of the classical and quantum parts. To leading order in $u$, it takes the form:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + (\\text{one-loop quantum correction}) + O(u^3) $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the One-Loop Quantum Correction**\n\nThe one-loop correction to the beta function is determined by calculating the one-loop divergence of the four-point vertex function. This involves evaluating three Feynman diagrams (the s, t, and u channels). The standard result from this calculation in the Minimal Subtraction (MS) or $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme is that the quantum correction adds a term proportional to $u^2$.\n\nThe one-loop calculation gives:\n$$ \\beta(u)_{\\text{quantum}} = \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^2 $$\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Coefficient of the Quantum Term**\nThe numerical prefactor is crucial. The factor of 3 comes from the three distinct diagrams. The factor of $1/(16\\pi^2)$ is characteristic of one-loop calculations in four dimensions. To leading order in $\\epsilon$, this coefficient is independent of $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 4: Write the Full Beta Function and Find the Fixed Point**\n\nCombining the classical and quantum parts, the one-loop beta function for the coupling $u$ is:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^2 $$\nA fixed point, denoted by $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$. At a fixed point, the theory becomes scale-invariant. We are looking for the non-trivial fixed point (where $u^* \\neq 0$), which is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nWe set the beta function to zero:\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} (u^*)^2 = 0 $$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the Fixed Point Coupling u***\n\nWe can factor the equation:\n$$ u^* \\left( -\\epsilon + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^* \\right) = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  $u^* = 0$: This is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, corresponding to a non-interacting theory.\n2.  $-\\epsilon + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^* = 0$: This gives the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nSolving the second equation for $u^*$:\n$$ \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^* = \\epsilon $$\n$$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon $$\n\n**Careful Point 4: Validity of the Approximation**\nThis result is the leading order expression in the $\\epsilon$-expansion. The fixed point value is $u^* \\propto \\epsilon$. Since $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be small, $u^*$ is also small. This self-consistently justifies our use of the one-loop beta function, as higher-loop terms (e.g., $\\propto u^3$) would contribute terms of order $\\epsilon^2$ and higher, which are negligible at this leading order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$ in the $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions is obtained by finding the non-trivial zero of the one-loop beta function $\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$. Setting $\\beta(u^*) = 0$ yields the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\n<<<u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon>>>"
