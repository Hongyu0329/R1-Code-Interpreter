The number of sets T, let's call it \(f_m\), can be computed with the recurrence relation:
For \(m > 0\),
if m is odd:
\(f_m = -f_{m-1} + \frac{1}{2^n}\binom{2^n}{m}\)
if m is even:
\(f_m = -f_{m-1} + \frac{1}{2^n}\left(\binom{2^n}{m} + (2^n-1)(-1)^{m/2}\binom{2^{n-1}}{m/2}\right)\)
with the base case \(f_0 = 1\).
