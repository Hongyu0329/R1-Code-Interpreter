    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of the specific value that is measured *between* individual heartbeats to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The method of capture mentioned is PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n\n2.  **Understand Heart Rate (HR) vs. Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR)** is the average number of heartbeats in a given time period, usually one minute (beats per minute or bpm).\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** is not about the average rate, but about the tiny fluctuations in the time *between* each consecutive heartbeat. A healthy heart does not beat with perfect regularity; there is natural variation. HRV quantifies this variation.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Measurement:** To measure the variation *between* beats, you must first measure the time interval *between* those beats. This time interval is the fundamental data point for all HRV calculations.\n\n4.  **Relate to the Technology (ECG and PPG):**\n    *   The gold standard for measuring heart activity is the Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG waveform has several components, with the most prominent spike being the \"R wave\" of the QRS complex, which corresponds to the main contraction of the heart's ventricles. The time measured from one R wave to the next is called the **R-R interval**. This is the classic and most widely used term.\n    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG), the technology mentioned in the question, works differently. It shines a light through the skin and measures changes in light absorption, which correspond to the pulse of blood flowing through the vessels. The time between the peaks of these pulse waves is measured. This is often called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** or Peak-to-Peak (PP) interval.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Determine the Best Answer:**\n    *   The measurement from a PPG sensor (IBI) is a very close proxy for the measurement from an ECG sensor (R-R interval).\n    *   In the field of HRV, the term **R-R interval** is the foundational and most universally understood term for the time between heartbeats, regardless of whether it was captured by an ECG or estimated from a PPG signal. Scientific papers and consumer device literature (like Whoop, Oura, Garmin) frequently refer to PPG-derived beat-to-beat intervals as R-R intervals.\n    *   Therefore, the value computed between heartbeats is the time interval, and its most common and standard name is the R-R interval.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **R-R Interval vs. IBI:** While \"Inter-beat Interval (IBI)\" is technically more precise for PPG data, \"R-R interval\" is the standard term used across the entire field of HRV.\n*   **R-R Interval vs. NN Interval:** Sometimes you may see the term \"NN interval\" (Normal-to-Normal). This refers to a series of R-R intervals that have been filtered to remove artifacts or abnormal beats (like premature ventricular contractions). The raw measurement is the R-R interval; the cleaned data used for analysis is often the NN interval series. The question asks for the fundamental value itself, which is the R-R interval.\n*   **Units:** This value is a measure of time, typically expressed in milliseconds (ms).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats, which forms the basis of HRV analysis, is the time duration between those beats. This is most commonly and standardly called the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
