    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components are:\n    *   A Russian text (described as a \"translation of a certain essay,\" which might be a slight misdirection).\n    *   A description of the wide boulevards in Vienna.\n    *   The appearance of an English poet's surname within this description.\n    *   The goal is to identify this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source:** The specific reference is a well-known literary anecdote from the work of the Soviet writer Yuri Olesha (Юрий Олеша). The work is his posthumously published book \"Ни дня без строчки\" (\"No Day Without a Line\"), which is a collection of diary entries, notes, and essayistic fragments.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Context:** In his book, Olesha describes his impressions of Vienna. He is particularly struck by the immense width and grandeur of the city's boulevards, most famously the Ringstrasse.\n\n4.  **Uncover the Wordplay:** To express his awe, Olesha employs a pun in the Russian language.\n    *   The Russian word for \"boulevard\" is **бульвар** (pronounced \"bul'var\").\n    *   Olesha felt that the Viennese boulevards were so magnificent that the ordinary word \"бульвар\" was insufficient.\n    *   He coined a new term by replacing the first part of the word with the surname of a famous English Romantic poet.\n\n5.  **Identify the Poet:** The poet he chose was Lord Byron.\n    *   In Russian, Byron is written as **Байрон** (pronounced \"Bayron\").\n    *   The pun is that the boulevards are not just \"бульвары\" (bul'vary) but \"**Байрон**-вары\" (\"Bayron-vary\").\n    *   This neologism cleverly combines the sound of the poet's name with the word for boulevard, suggesting a scale and romantic grandeur worthy of the poet himself.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The English poet whose surname appears in this context is Byron.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Nature of the Source:** The question refers to a \"Russian translation of an essay.\" The actual source is an original work by a Russian-language author, Yuri Olesha. This is a common type of slight inaccuracy in such questions, but the core elements remain correct.\n*   **The Pun is Key:** The entire puzzle hinges on understanding the linguistic pun in Russian between \"бульвар\" (bul'var) and \"Байрон\" (Bayron).\n*   **The Poet's Relevance:** Lord Byron was chosen not just for the phonetic similarity but also because his name evokes Romanticism, grandeur, and a larger-than-life spirit, which is precisely the impression Olesha wanted to convey about Vienna's boulevards.\n*   **The Language of the Answer:** The question specifically asks for the surname *in English*.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the surname.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
