    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeating pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, driving the oligomerization. The residues at 'e' and 'g' are often charged or polar and are located at the edges of the hydrophobic core, frequently forming stabilizing salt bridges.\n\nLet's align the given sequence, `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, to this heptad repeat. The sequence is 30 amino acids long, which corresponds to approximately four full heptad repeats (4 x 7 = 28). The most straightforward alignment starts from the first residue:\n\n*   **Repeat 1:** G(a) E(b) I(c) A(d) Q(e) S(f) L(g)\n*   **Repeat 2:** K(a) E(b) I(c) A(d) K(e) S(f) L(g)\n*   **Repeat 3:** K(a) E(b) I(c) W(d) S(e) L(f) K(g)\n*   **Repeat 4:** E(a) I(b) A(c) Q(d) S(e) L(f) K(g) -> Let's correct the alignment based on the sequence.\n    *   Sequence: `G E I A Q S L | K E I A K S L | K E I A W S L | K E I A Q S L | K G`\n    *   **Repeat 1:** G(a) E(b) I(c) A(d) Q(e) S(f) L(g)\n    *   **Repeat 2:** K(a) E(b) I(c) A(d) K(e) S(f) L(g)\n    *   **Repeat 3:** K(a) E(b) I(c) W(d) S(e) L(f) K(g) -> Let's re-examine the sequence carefully. The third repeat has a W. `K E I A W S L`.\n    *   **Corrected Repeat 3:** K(a) E(b) I(c) A(d) W(e) S(f) L(g) -> This doesn't match the sequence.\n    *   Let's re-read the sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. The W is at position 19.\n    *   Let's try the first alignment again, very carefully.\n    *   `G(a) E(b) I(c) A(d) Q(e) S(f) L(g)`\n    *   `K(a) E(b) I(c) A(d) K(e) S(f) L(g)`\n    *   `K(a) E(b) I(c) A(d)` -> This doesn't work. The W is missed.\n\nLet's try the most chemically sensible alignment based on hydrophobic patterns, which often reveals the correct frame. The `i, i+3` spacing is characteristic of `a` and `d` positions. The sequence has a strong `IxxxL/W` pattern, but also an `LxxxI` pattern. Let's assume the first residue `G` is in the `a` position, as it is the most standard way to start.\n\n*   **Sequence:** `G E I A Q S L | K E I A K S L | K E I A W S L | K E I A Q S L | K G`\n*   **'a' positions:** G, K, K, K\n*   **'d' positions:** A, A, W, A\n*   **'e' positions:** Q, K, S, Q\n*   **'g' positions:** L, L, K, L\n\nThis alignment is the most consistent with a repeating 7-residue pattern. We will proceed with this assignment.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Positions ('a' and 'd')**\n\nThe identity and size of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state due to the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing requirements.\n\n*   **'a' positions (G, K, K, K):** This is a mix of a very small residue (Glycine) and a large, positively charged residue (Lysine).\n*   **'d' positions (A, A, W, A):** This is a mix of a very small residue (Alanine) and a very large residue (Tryptophan).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Plausible Oligomeric States**\n\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a trimer, the 'a' positions are buried in the very center of the core, while the 'd' positions are slightly more peripheral. Having three large, positively charged Lysine (K) residues pointing into the center at several layers would create immense steric and electrostatic repulsion. Similarly, having three very large Tryptophan (W) residues at the 'd' position in one layer would cause severe steric clashes. Therefore, a trimer is highly unlikely.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a dimer, the 'a' position of one helix packs against the 'd' position of the other.\n    *   Layers with `a=K, d=A`: This involves packing a large residue (K) against a small one (A). This is sterically favorable and is good for packing efficiency.\n    *   Layer with `a=K, d=W`: This involves packing a large residue (K) against another very large residue (W). This would likely cause some steric strain.\n    *   A dimer is plausible based on the core packing, but it is not perfect.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** A parallel tetramer would have an 'a-a' packing interface and a 'd-d' packing interface.\n    *   At layers with `a=K`, the 'a-a' interface would involve four Lysine residues, leading to massive repulsion.\n    *   At the layer with `d=W`, the 'd-d' interface would involve four Tryptophan residues, leading to massive steric clashes.\n    *   A simple parallel tetramer is therefore extremely unlikely.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Non-Core Positions and Alternative Structures**\n\nThe analysis so far suggests a dimer is the most plausible, but there's an issue. Let's look at the 'e' and 'g' positions, which are typically solvent-exposed.\n\n*   **'g' positions (L, L, K, L):** Three out of the four 'g' positions are occupied by Leucine (L), a strongly hydrophobic residue.\n*   In a simple dimer or trimer, these hydrophobic Leucines would be exposed to the aqueous solvent, which is highly unfavorable energetically. This suggests that this face of the helix must be involved in further interactions to bury these hydrophobic residues.\n\nThis leads to the **dimer-of-dimers hypothesis**.\n1.  The protein first forms a dimer, driven by the interactions at the 'a' and 'd' positions. This dimer is the primary coiled-coil structure.\n2.  Two of these dimers then associate to form a tetramer. This second association is driven by the interactions between the solvent-exposed faces of the dimers. The hydrophobic Leucine residues at the 'g' positions provide a strong driving force for this association, creating a new hydrophobic interface between the two dimers.\n\nThis model successfully explains all the key features of the sequence:\n*   The `a/d` packing is consistent with a dimer.\n*   The highly unusual hydrophobic residues at the 'g' position are explained as forming the interface for the dimerization of dimers.\n*   The final structure is a tetramer, which achieves the most efficient packing and burial of hydrophobic residues for the entire sequence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the principles of knobs-into-holes interactions and overall packing efficiency that considers all residues, the sequence is designed to form a tetramer via a dimer-of-dimers assembly mechanism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
