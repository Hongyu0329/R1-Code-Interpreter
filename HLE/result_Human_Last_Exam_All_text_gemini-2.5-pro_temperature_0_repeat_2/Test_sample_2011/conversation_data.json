    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are working with a graph `G` that has a set of vertices `V` with `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `V' ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[V']` consists of the vertices `V'` and *all* the edges from the original graph `G` that have both endpoints in `V'`.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** The question asks for clique sizes that appear as *induced subgraphs*. If a set of `k` vertices forms a clique, it means all `k(k-1)/2` possible edges between them exist in the graph `G`. The subgraph induced by these `k` vertices will therefore be a complete graph `K_k`. So, finding a set of `k` vertices that form a clique is equivalent to finding an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find a single graph `G` with 128 vertices that contains the highest possible number of different clique sizes. For example, if a graph has induced cliques of size 3, 5, and 10, it has 3 different clique sizes. We want to maximize this count.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound\n\nLet `G` be any graph on `n=128` vertices.\nLet `C` be a clique in `G`. The size of the clique, `k = |C|`, is the number of vertices in it.\nSince the total number of vertices in the graph is 128, any subset of vertices (including a clique) can have at most 128 vertices.\nTherefore, any possible clique size `k` must be an integer satisfying `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\nThe set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes cannot exceed the total number of possibilities, which is 128.\nSo, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Graph to Achieve the Upper Bound\n\nNow, we need to determine if it's possible to construct a graph on 128 vertices that actually contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_128`. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's check which clique sizes appear as induced subgraphs in `K_128`.\n\n*   **Clique of size k=1:** Pick any single vertex. This vertex by itself forms a `K_1`. So, `K_128` has an induced clique of size 1.\n*   **Clique of size k=2:** Pick any two vertices. By the definition of `K_128`, they are connected by an edge. These two vertices induce a `K_2`. So, `K_128` has an induced clique of size 2.\n*   **Clique of size k (for any 1 ≤ k ≤ 128):** Let's generalize. Choose any subset of `k` vertices from the 128 available vertices. Let this subset be `V'`. Since the original graph is `K_128`, every pair of vertices in the entire graph is connected. Therefore, every pair of vertices within the subset `V'` is also connected. The subgraph induced by `V'` contains all these vertices and all the edges between them, which means the induced subgraph is a complete graph on `k` vertices, `K_k`.\n\nThis shows that for any integer `k` from 1 to 128, we can find an induced subgraph in `K_128` that is a `K_k`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  We established an upper bound: A graph on 128 vertices can have at most **128** different clique sizes.\n2.  We found a specific graph, the complete graph `K_128`, that achieves this bound. It contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128, for a total of 128 different sizes.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
