    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character's Structure**\nThe character in question is 謄. At first glance, it's a complex character, and its components are not immediately obvious as standard radicals. Visually breaking it down in its modern form can be misleading. The left side resembles 月 (tsuki) and the right side resembles 朕 (chin), but this is not the correct decomposition for identifying the radical.\n\n**Step 2: Consult a Kanji Dictionary for the Official Radical**\nTo accurately identify the radical (部首, bushu), we must refer to a standard kanji dictionary. According to official classifications, the radical for 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Reason for the Radical Classification**\nThe modern Japanese character 謄 is a simplified form (shinjitai). Its traditional form (kyūjitai) is 謄. In the traditional form, the structure is much clearer:\n*   **Left side:** 言 (word, speech)\n*   **Right side:** 朕 (a phonetic component)\n\nThe character 謄 is a phono-semantic compound, where 言 is the semantic component (the radical), indicating the character's meaning is related to words or speech (e.g., \"to transcribe,\" \"to copy\"). The radical is determined by this original structure. The simplification process in creating the modern shinjitai character merged and altered the original components, making the 言 radical less recognizable.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Name of the Radical**\nThe radical is 言. When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏). The specific name for the 言 radical in this position is ごんべん (gonben).\n\n**Step 5: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe question asks for the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n*   Japanese name: ごんべん\n*   Hepburn transcription: Gonben\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Shinjitai vs. Kyūjitai:** Many modern Japanese characters (shinjitai) are simplified versions of traditional characters (kyūjitai). The radical is often based on the traditional form, even if it's not obvious in the modern form.\n*   **Visual Decomposition:** Do not rely solely on visually breaking down a complex modern character. The official radical is based on etymology and established dictionary classification.\n*   **Radical Naming Conventions:** Radicals have specific names based on their form and position within a character (e.g., -hen for left side, -tsukuri for right side, -kammuri for top, -ashi for bottom). For 言 on the left, the name is \"Gonben\".\n\nFollowing this analysis, the final answer is the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
