    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Curve and the Field**\n\n*   The curve is $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial in $x$ is $d=5$, so the genus of the curve is $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n*   The base field is a 2-adic field, which we can take as $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\n*   The ring of integers is $O_K = \\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the residue field is $k = \\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a Suitable Model by Changing Coordinates**\n\nThe given model $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ is not good. Reducing it modulo 2 gives $z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, or $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. The special fiber is a non-reduced double line, so the model is not stable.\n\nTo find a better model, we analyze the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. Let $\\alpha$ be a root.\n$2\\alpha^5 + 2\\alpha^3 + 1 = 0$.\nTaking valuations, we must balance the terms. Let $v(\\alpha) = e$.\nIf $e \\ge 0$, $v(2\\alpha^5+2\\alpha^3) \\ge 1$ while $v(-1)=0$. This is impossible.\nIf $e < 0$, the term with the most negative valuation is $2x^5$. Its valuation is $v(2\\alpha^5) = 1+5e$. This must be balanced by the term of valuation 0, which is 1.\nSo, $1+5e=0 \\implies e = -1/5$.\nAll 5 roots of $f(x)$ have valuation $-1/5$.\n\nThis suggests a change of variables in an extension field. Let $K' = K(\\pi)$ where $\\pi^5 = 2$. This is a totally ramified extension of degree 5. The valuation on $K'$, let's call it $v'$, is normalized by setting $v'(\\pi)=1$. Then $v'(2) = v'(\\pi^5) = 5$. The relation between the valuations is $v' = 5v$.\n\nLet's perform the change of variables $x = X/\\pi$.\n$z^2 = 2(X/\\pi)^5 + 2(X/\\pi)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = \\frac{2X^5}{\\pi^5} + \\frac{2X^3}{\\pi^3} + 1$\nSubstituting $2=\\pi^5$:\n$z^2 = X^5 + \\frac{\\pi^5 X^3}{\\pi^3} + 1$\n$z^2 = X^5 + \\pi^2 X^3 + 1$\n\nThis gives a new model $\\mathcal{C}'$ for the curve, defined over the ring of integers $O_{K'} = \\mathbb{Z}_2[\\pi]$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Special Fiber of the New Model**\n\nLet's find the special fiber of $\\mathcal{C}'$ by reducing the equation modulo $\\pi$.\n$z^2 \\equiv X^5 + 1 \\pmod \\pi$.\nOver the residue field $k' \\cong \\mathbb{F}_2$, this is $z^2 = X^5+1$.\nWe can factor the right-hand side over $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$X^5+1 = (X+1)(X^4+X^3+X^2+X+1)$.\nThe polynomial $X^4+X^3+X^2+X+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe special fiber is a singular curve. This model is still not the stable model, but it reveals the structure of the reduction.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure of the Stable Reduction**\n\nThe factorization of the polynomial modulo $\\pi$ induces a partition of the roots. By Hensel's Lemma, the polynomial $h(X) = X^5 + \\pi^2 X^3 + 1$ factors over $O_{K'}$ as $h(X) = H_1(X) H_2(X)$, where $H_1(X) \\equiv X+1 \\pmod \\pi$ and $H_2(X) \\equiv X^4+X^3+X^2+X+1 \\pmod \\pi$.\n\nThis means the set of branch points of the curve (the roots of $f(x)$ plus the point at infinity) is partitioned into clusters. The factorization suggests a partition of the finite branch points into a cluster $I$ of size 1 (corresponding to the root of $H_1$) and a cluster $J$ of size 4 (corresponding to the roots of $H_2$). The point at infinity forms a third cluster, but for simplicity, we can determine the structure from the finite clusters.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve will have a special fiber whose components are linked according to this clustering. The dual graph of the special fiber is a tree. In this case, it consists of two components, $C_I$ and $C_J$, corresponding to the clusters $I$ and $J$, connected by a node (a double point).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Genera of the Components and the Thickness of the Node**\n\nThe genus of a component $C_K$ corresponding to a cluster $K$ of finite branch points is given by $g_K = \\lfloor(|K|-1)/2\\rfloor$ when the total number of branch points is even (here $d+1=6$).\n*   For cluster $I$, $|I|=1$. The genus is $g_I = \\lfloor(1-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$. The component $C_I$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n*   For cluster $J$, $|J|=4$. The genus is $g_J = \\lfloor(4-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$. The component $C_J$ is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe sum of the genera of the components is $g_I+g_J = 0+1=1$. The total genus of the curve is $g=2$. The discrepancy is accounted for by the number of loops in the dual graph, $h_1(\\Gamma)$.\n$g = \\sum g_K + h_1(\\Gamma) \\implies 2 = 1 + h_1(\\Gamma) \\implies h_1(\\Gamma)=1$.\nThis means the dual graph has one loop. The simplest way for this to happen is for the two components $C_I$ and $C_J$ to intersect at two distinct points (nodes).\n\nLet $n_1$ and $n_2$ be the thicknesses of these two nodes. The conductor formula (also known as Ogg's formula for semistable curves) relates the genus of the generic fiber $g$, the arithmetic genus of the special fiber $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k)$, and the thicknesses of the nodes.\nThe formula for the exponent of the conductor is $\\delta = 2g - 2 - (2p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k)-2)$.\nFor a semistable curve, $\\delta = \\sum_{P} (n_P - 1)$, where the sum is over all nodes $P$ and $n_P$ is the thickness of node $P$.\nThe arithmetic genus of the special fiber is $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k) = \\sum g_K + h_1(\\Gamma) = (0+1)+1=2$.\nSo, $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k) = g = 2$.\nPlugging this into the conductor formula:\n$\\delta = 2(2)-2 - (2(2)-2) = 2 - 2 = 0$.\nWe have $\\sum (n_P-1) = (n_1-1) + (n_2-1) = 0$.\nSince the thickness $n_P$ must be a positive integer, the only solution is $n_1=1$ and $n_2=1$.\n\nThe question asks for \"the\" thickness of \"the\" double point, which might imply there is only one. However, the analysis based on the genus formula consistently points to a configuration with two nodes, each of thickness 1. It is common in such problems that the components of the stable reduction meet in more than one point, but they are all of the same nature. Therefore, the thickness of any such double point is 1.\n\nFinal check: The argument $z^2 = F_1 F_2 + \\pi^2 g$ suggested a thickness of 2. This argument is a simplified rule of thumb that does not account for the full geometry of the situation, particularly the fact that the perturbation term $g(X)=X^3$ vanishes at the singular point of the special fiber ($X=0$), which complicates the calculation of the thickness. The conductor formula is more fundamental and robust. The calculation based on it, leading to thickness 1, is the most reliable."
