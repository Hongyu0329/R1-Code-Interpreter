    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum of an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$, where:\n*   $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron.\n*   $p$ is the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Given Information and Relevant Principles**\n1.  **Uncertainty in Position ($\\Delta x$):** The problem states that the uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n2.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The mathematical relationship is:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ JÂ·s}$).\n    To find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n3.  **Bohr Model:** This model describes the properties of an electron in an atom. For an electron in the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$):\n    *   The angular momentum ($L$) is quantized: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. For the first orbit, $L = \\hbar$.\n    *   The momentum of the electron is $p = mv$.\n    *   The radius of the first Bohr orbit is a constant value, known as the Bohr radius ($a_0$), where $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate a Plan**\n1.  Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the given $\\Delta x$.\n2.  Calculate the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit using the principles of the Bohr model.\n3.  Compute the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n### **Step 4: Execute the Plan**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n\n*   From the Uncertainty Principle: $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   We are given $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$. We must convert this to SI units (meters):\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   So, the expression for $\\Delta p$ is:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Momentum ($p$) in the First Bohr Orbit**\n\n*   From the Bohr model, the angular momentum for the first orbit ($n=1$) is $L = mvr_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar = \\hbar$.\n*   The linear momentum is $p = mv$.\n*   Substituting $p$ into the angular momentum equation: $p \\cdot r_1 = \\hbar$.\n*   The radius of the first Bohr orbit is $r_1 = a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Therefore, the momentum is:\n    $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1} = \\frac{\\hbar}{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}$\n\n**Part C: Calculate the Ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$**\n\n*   Now we can set up the ratio using the expressions from Part A and Part B:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}\\right)}$\n*   We can simplify this expression by canceling $\\hbar$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{\\hbar} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   This simplification is a **careful point**, as it means we don't need the value of Planck's constant to find the final ratio.\n*   Now, substitute the numerical values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$:\n    *   $r_1 = a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\Delta x = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n*   Perform the final calculation:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\n### **Summary of Careful Points**\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Always convert given values to standard SI units (e.g., picometers to meters) before performing calculations.\n*   **Principle Selection:** Correctly identify that the problem requires both the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (for $\\Delta p$) and the Bohr model (for $p$).\n*   **Form of the Uncertainty Principle:** Use the standard form $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ and take the equality for the minimum uncertainty.\n*   **Bohr Model Formulas:** Correctly recall or derive the momentum of the electron from the quantization of angular momentum ($L=n\\hbar$).\n*   **Symbolic Simplification:** Simplifying the ratio algebraically before plugging in numbers ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$) reduces the chance of calculation errors and makes the computation simpler.\n\nThe final ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
