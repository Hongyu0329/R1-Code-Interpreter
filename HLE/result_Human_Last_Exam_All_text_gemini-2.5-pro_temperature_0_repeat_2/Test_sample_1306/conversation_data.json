    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebraic Structure\nThe question concerns the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. This algebra is generated by elements $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ subject to the relations:\n*   $K K^{-1} = K^{-1} K = 1$\n*   $K E K^{-1} = q^2 E$\n*   $K F K^{-1} = q^{-2} F$\n*   $[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$\n\nThe condition that $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$) is crucial. In this case, the representation theory is starkly different from the case where $q$ is not a root of unity. Specifically, the category of finite-dimensional representations is not semisimple, which means there exist representations that are indecomposable but not irreducible (i.e., they are reducible).\n\nThe key parameter for the representation theory at a root of unity is the smallest integer $l > 1$ such that $q^{2l}=1$. Since $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, we have $q^2 = e^{4\\pi i/3}$. We need $(q^2)^l = e^{4\\pi i l/3} = 1$, which implies $3$ must divide $4l$. Since $l$ must be an integer, $3$ must divide $l$. The smallest such integer greater than 1 is $l=3$.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Category C and the Goal\nThe category $C$ is the category of all indecomposable finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$-representations. The objects of this category are the isomorphism classes of these representations. The question asks for the percentage of these objects that are irreducible. Since the set of objects is infinite, \"percentage\" cannot be calculated by simple counting. It must be interpreted in the context of the structure of the space of all such objects.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying the Indecomposable Representations\nThe isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations form a moduli space. We need to understand the structure of this space. The indecomposable representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity are classified into several families. A large portion of them are the so-called \"cyclic\" or \"semicyclic\" modules.\n\nA finite-dimensional indecomposable module $V$ is a highest-weight module. It is characterized by a highest-weight vector $v_0$ and the actions of the central elements of a certain subalgebra. For $l=3$, the elements $E^3, F^3, K^3$ are central in a related \"small quantum group\". Their action on highest weight vectors helps classify the modules for the full quantum group.\n\nAn indecomposable module $V$ can be parameterized (up to isomorphism) by a triple $(\\mu, a, b) \\in \\mathbb{C}^* \\times \\mathbb{C} \\times \\mathbb{C}$, where:\n*   $\\mu = \\lambda^3$, where $\\lambda$ is the highest weight (i.e., $Kv_0 = \\lambda v_0$).\n*   $a$ is the scalar by which $E^3$ acts on $v_0$.\n*   $b$ is the scalar by which $F^3$ acts on $v_0$.\n\nThis parameterization covers a large family of indecomposable modules. Let's analyze this family:\n*   The parameter space for this family is $P = \\mathbb{C}^* \\times \\mathbb{C} \\times \\mathbb{C}$, which is a 3-dimensional complex manifold.\n*   **Irreducibility Condition:** A module parameterized by $(\\mu, a, b)$ is irreducible if and only if $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$.\n*   **Reducibility Condition:** The module is reducible (but still indecomposable) if $a=0$ or $b=0$ (but not both).\n*   **Decomposability Condition:** If $a=b=0$, the module is typically decomposable, *except* for a few special values of $\\mu$.\n\nIn addition to this main family, there are other indecomposable modules that arise precisely at these special values of $\\mu$ where the $a=b=0$ modules are indecomposable. These form families of lower dimension.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Moduli Space of Representations\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be the moduli space of all indecomposable representations.\n1.  **The Main Component:** The family of modules parameterized by $(\\mu, a, b)$ forms a 3-dimensional component of $\\mathcal{M}$. Let's call it $\\mathcal{M}_{main}$.\n2.  **Other Components:** Other indecomposable modules (e.g., those where $E^3=F^3=0$) exist, but they form families parameterized by fewer variables. For instance, they are parameterized by a single complex number $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$, thus forming 1-dimensional families. There are also a finite number of \"discrete\" indecomposable modules.\n\nThe dimension of the entire moduli space $\\mathcal{M}$ is the maximum dimension of its components, which is 3.\n\n### Step 5: Identifying the Irreducible and Reducible Parts\nNow we analyze the subsets of $\\mathcal{M}$ corresponding to irreducible and reducible modules.\n*   **Irreducible Modules ($\\mathcal{M}_{irr}$):**\n    *   Within the main 3-dimensional component $\\mathcal{M}_{main}$, the irreducible modules correspond to parameters where $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$. The parameter space is $\\mathbb{C}^* \\times \\mathbb{C}^* \\times \\mathbb{C}^*$. This is a 3-dimensional space.\n    *   There are also a few discrete irreducible modules (like the classical $L_1, L_2$ representations), but these form a 0-dimensional part of the moduli space.\n    *   The highest dimension of a component of $\\mathcal{M}_{irr}$ is 3.\n\n*   **Reducible Indecomposable Modules ($\\mathcal{M}_{red}$):**\n    *   Within $\\mathcal{M}_{main}$, the reducible modules correspond to parameters where $a=0, b \\neq 0$ or $a \\neq 0, b=0$. The parameter space for these is $(\\mathbb{C}^* \\times (\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{C}^*)) \\cup (\\mathbb{C}^* \\times (\\mathbb{C}^* \\times \\{0\\}))$. This is a union of two 2-dimensional spaces.\n    *   The other families of indecomposable modules (the 1-dimensional and 0-dimensional ones) are all reducible.\n    *   The highest dimension of a component of $\\mathcal{M}_{red}$ is 2.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the \"Percentage\"\nThe question \"What percentage of the objects of C are irreducible?\" is a question about the \"size\" of $\\mathcal{M}_{irr}$ relative to $\\mathcal{M}$. In the context of algebraic geometry, this is determined by comparing the dimensions of the spaces.\n\n*   The space of all indecomposable modules $\\mathcal{M}$ has dimension 3.\n*   The space of irreducible modules $\\mathcal{M}_{irr}$ also has dimension 3.\n*   The space of reducible indecomposable modules $\\mathcal{M}_{red}$ has dimension 2.\n\nThe set of irreducible modules corresponds to a Zariski-open and dense subset of the full moduli space $\\mathcal{M}$. The set of reducible modules is a \"thin\" subset, meaning it is contained in a lower-dimensional closed subvariety.\n\nA property that holds on a Zariski-open dense subset is said to hold for a \"generic\" object. When asked for a percentage in such a setting, the answer reflects this genericity. The measure of the lower-dimensional subset is zero compared to the full space. Therefore, we conclude that 100% of the objects are irreducible in this sense.\n\nThis is analogous to asking: \"What percentage of complex $n \\times n$ matrices are invertible?\" The space of all matrices is $\\mathbb{C}^{n^2}$. The non-invertible matrices are those with determinant zero, which define a hypersurface of dimension $n^2-1$. This is a lower-dimensional subset, so a \"generic\" matrix is invertible, and the percentage is 100%.\n\nFinal Answer: The set of irreducible representations is a dense open subset of the space of all indecomposable representations. The reducible indecomposable representations form a subset of lower dimension. Thus, 100% of the objects of C are irreducible."
