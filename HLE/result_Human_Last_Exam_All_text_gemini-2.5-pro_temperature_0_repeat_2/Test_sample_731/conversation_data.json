    "Answering the question requires a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Semidihedral Group**\n\nThe group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor a size of 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n = 9$.\nSo, the group is $G = SD_{2^9}$, with the presentation:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{9-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{9-2}-1} \\rangle$\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\nThe elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $sr^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. That is, $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nWe need to find all distinct subgroups of $G=SD_{512}$ that can be formed in this way.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the set of powers $G^k$**\n\nWe will analyze the structure of the set $G^k$ by considering two cases for the integer $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer.**\n\n*   The orders of elements in $G = SD_{2^9}$ are powers of 2. The maximum order is the order of $r$, which is 256. The exponent of the group, $\\exp(G)$, is the least common multiple of the orders of all elements, which is 256.\n*   If $k$ is odd, then $k$ is coprime to the exponent of the group, i.e., $\\gcd(k, \\exp(G)) = \\gcd(k, 256) = 1$.\n*   In any finite group, if $k$ is coprime to the exponent, the map $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a permutation of the group's elements.\n*   This means that the set of $k$-th powers is the entire group itself: $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} = G$.\n*   Since $G$ is a subgroup of itself, it is a power subgroup. All odd values of $k$ yield the same power subgroup, which is $G$ itself. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is an even integer.**\n\n*   Let $k = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$. We need to compute the set $G^{2m} = \\{g^{2m} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n*   Let's consider the two types of elements in $G$:\n    1.  If $g = r^i$, then $g^k = (r^i)^{2m} = r^{2im}$. The set of all such elements for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, 255$ is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2m} \\rangle$.\n    2.  If $g = sr^i$, we first need to find its square. Using the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^i = r^{127i}s$.\n        Then, $(sr^i)^2 = (sr^i)(sr^i) = (r^{127i}s)sr^i = r^{127i}s^2r^i = r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i}$.\n        (In general for $SD_{2^n}$, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$).\n        So, $g^k = g^{2m} = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im}$.\n*   The set of powers $G^k = G^{2m}$ is the union of the sets from these two types of elements:\n    $G^{2m} = \\{r^{2im} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} \\cup \\{r^{128im} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\langle r^{2m} \\rangle \\cup \\{1, r^{128m}\\}$.\n*   We must check if this set is a subgroup. The element $r^{128m}$ can be written as $(r^{2m})^{64}$. Since this is a power of the generator $r^{2m}$, it is already included in the subgroup $\\langle r^{2m} \\rangle$.\n*   Therefore, for any even $k=2m$, the set of powers is $G^k = \\langle r^{2m} \\rangle$. This is always a cyclic subgroup of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nFrom the analysis above, the power subgroups of $G=SD_{512}$ are:\n1.  The group $G$ itself (from odd $k$).\n2.  Subgroups of the form $\\langle r^{2m} \\rangle$ (from even $k=2m$).\n\nNow, we count the number of distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle r^{2m} \\rangle$.\nThe subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_{256}$ are of the form $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 256.\nA subgroup of the form $\\langle r^{2m} \\rangle$ is equal to $\\langle r^{\\gcd(2m, 256)} \\rangle$.\nLet $d = \\gcd(2m, 256)$. Since $2m$ is even and 256 is even, their gcd, $d$, must also be even.\nThe divisors of 256 are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$ (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256).\nThe even divisors are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$. There are **8** such divisors.\n\nFor each of these 8 even divisors $d=2^j$ (where $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 8\\}$), we can find an integer $m$ such that $\\gcd(2m, 256) = d$. For example, choosing $m = 2^{j-1}$ gives $2m=2^j$, and $\\gcd(2^j, 256) = 2^j = d$.\nThis means we can generate 8 distinct cyclic subgroups:\n$\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n\nThese 8 subgroups are distinct from each other (as they have different orders) and are also distinct from the full group $G$ (since they are cyclic and $G$ is not).\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the two cases:\n*   1 subgroup from odd values of $k$ (the group $G$ itself).\n*   8 distinct subgroups from even values of $k$ (the cyclic subgroups $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ for $j=1, \\dots, 8$).\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $1 + 8 = 9$."
