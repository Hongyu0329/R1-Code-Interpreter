No, it is not possible. There is a fundamental category error between the two systems. Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument in higher-order modal logic, dealing with abstract metaphysical concepts like "positive property" and "necessary existence." The mathematics of quantum mechanics is a framework based on Hilbert spaces and operators, designed to model and predict the probabilistic behavior of physical systems. The concepts of one system cannot be meaningfully translated into the other, and the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics (e.g., the Schrödinger equation) are not capable of performing the logical deductions required by Gödel's proof.
