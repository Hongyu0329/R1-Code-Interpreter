No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry syndromes is to present a recognizable warning signal to predators, which for bumblebees are primarily birds. The validity of the clustering depends on whether the signal is perceived as similar by these predators. The proposed method uses human undergraduates as a proxy for predators. This is a fundamental flaw because the human visual system is significantly different from that of a bird. Humans are trichromats and cannot see ultraviolet (UV) light. Birds are tetrachromats and their vision extends into the UV spectrum. Bumblebee color patterns can include UV reflectance that is invisible to humans but visible to birds. Therefore, two species that look identical to a human may look very different to a bird, and vice-versa. Basing the clustering on human perception ignores a critical sensory dimension of the signal and will not produce an ecologically meaningful result.
