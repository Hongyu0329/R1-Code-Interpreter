The solutions are:
1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2. An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = y_k i$ for each integer $k \le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real solution to $-y = e^{-y\pi(1/2+2k)}$.
3. An infinite set of other complex solutions $z=x+yi$ which, for some integer $k$, satisfy the system of equations: $-y = e^{-y\pi(1/2+2k)}\cos(x\pi(1/2+2k))$ and $x = e^{-y\pi(1/2+2k)}\sin(x\pi(1/2+2k))$.
