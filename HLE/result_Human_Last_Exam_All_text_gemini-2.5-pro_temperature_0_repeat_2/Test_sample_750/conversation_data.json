    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the equation and complex exponentiation**\n\nThe given equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe term $i^z$ is a complex exponentiation. For complex numbers $a$ and $b$, $a^b$ is defined as $e^{b \\log(a)}$. The complex logarithm $\\log(a)$ is a multi-valued function given by:\n$\\log(a) = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$, where $k$ is any integer ($k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\n\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\pi/2$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$.\nLet's define $C_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$ for simplicity. So, $\\log(i) = iC_k$.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot iC_k}$\n\n**Step 2: Express z in Cartesian form and substitute**\n\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSubstitute this into the equation.\n\nLeft Hand Side (LHS):\n$z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\n\nRight Hand Side (RHS):\n$e^{z \\cdot iC_k} = e^{(x+yi)iC_k} = e^{(xi - y)C_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{a+ib} = e^a(\\cos(b) + i\\sin(b))$, the RHS becomes:\n$e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\n**Step 3: Equate real and imaginary parts**\n\nNow, we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k) + i \\cdot e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nBy comparing the real and imaginary parts, we get a system of two equations:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\nWe need to find all pairs $(x, y)$ that solve this system for some integer $k$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze special cases**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions (y=0)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $0 = e^{0}\\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$\n2.  $x = e^{0}\\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nFrom equation (1), $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$. This implies that the argument of the sine function must be an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$:\n$xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + n)$ for some integer $n$.\n$x\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k) = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + n) \\implies x(\\frac{4k+1}{2}) = \\frac{2n+1}{2} \\implies x = \\frac{2n+1}{4k+1}$.\n\nFrom equation (2), since $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$, we have:\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\n\nNow we must satisfy both conditions for $x$:\n$(-1)^n = \\frac{2n+1}{4k+1} \\implies (-1)^n(4k+1) = 2n+1$.\n\n*   If $n$ is even (e.g., $n=2m$), then $(-1)^n=1$. The equation becomes $4k+1 = 2(2m)+1 = 4m+1$, which implies $k=m$. This is always possible for any integer $k$ by choosing $m=k$. In this case, $x = (-1)^{2m} = 1$.\n    Thus, $z=1$ is a solution. Let's verify: $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i=i$. This is correct.\n\n*   If $n$ is odd (e.g., $n=2m+1$), then $(-1)^n=-1$. The equation becomes $-(4k+1) = 2(2m+1)+1 = 4m+3$. This simplifies to $-4k-4 = 4m$, or $m = -k-1$. This is always possible for any integer $k$ by choosing $m=-k-1$. In this case, $x = (-1)^{2m+1} = -1$.\n    Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution. Let's verify: $-1 \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = 1/i = -i$. This is correct.\n\nSo, we have found two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions (x=0)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$\n2.  $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$. This is always true.\n\nSo we only need to solve $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for real $y$ and integer $k$.\nLet $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$. We are looking for the roots of $f(y)=0$.\n\n*   If $C_k > 0$ (i.e., $\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+2k) > 0 \\implies 4k+1 > 0 \\implies k \\ge 0$):\n    Let's analyze the graphs of $g(y)=-y$ and $h(y)=e^{-yC_k}$. For $y>0$, $g(y)$ is negative while $h(y)$ is positive, so no solution. For $y=0$, $g(0)=0$ and $h(0)=1$, no solution. For $y<0$, let $y=-a$ with $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{aC_k}$. The function $j(a) = e^{aC_k}-a$ has a minimum value of $\\frac{1+\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. For a solution to exist, this minimum must be $\\le 0$. This requires $\\ln(C_k) \\le -1$, or $C_k \\le 1/e$.\n    For $k=0$, $C_0 = \\pi/2 \\approx 1.57 > 1/e$. For all $k>0$, $C_k$ is even larger. So there are no solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n\n*   If $C_k < 0$ (i.e., $k \\le -1$):\n    Let $C_k = -D_k$ where $D_k = -\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+2k) > 0$. The equation is $-y = e^{yD_k}$.\n    Let's analyze the graphs of $g(y)=-y$ and $h(y)=e^{yD_k}$. For $y \\ge 0$, $g(y) \\le 0$ and $h(y) \\ge 1$, so no solution. For $y<0$, both functions are positive. Let $y=-a$ with $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{-aD_k}$.\n    The function $j(a) = e^{-aD_k}-a$ is strictly decreasing for $a>0$, with $j(0)=1$ and $j(a) \\to -\\infty$ as $a \\to \\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is exactly one positive solution $a_k$ for each $k \\le -1$.\n    This gives a unique solution $y_k = -a_k < 0$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n\nSo, we have an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions, $z_k = y_k i$, one for each integer $k \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, \\dots\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: General complex solutions**\n\nFor any other solutions $z=x+yi$ where $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$, they must satisfy the system of equations derived in Step 3 for some integer $k$:\n1.  $-y = e^{-y\\pi(1/2+2k)}\\cos(x\\pi(1/2+2k))$\n2.  $x = e^{-y\\pi(1/2+2k)}\\sin(x\\pi(1/2+2k))$\n\nThese equations are transcendental and do not generally have simple closed-form solutions. However, a full description of the solution set must acknowledge their existence. For each integer $k$, this system can be solved numerically to find further solutions. For example, detailed analysis shows that for each integer $k \\ge 0$, there is a unique solution in the fourth quadrant of the complex plane.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\nThe solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **Real Solutions**: There are two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n2.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions**: There is a countably infinite set of purely imaginary solutions. For each integer $k \\le -1$, there exists a unique solution $z_k = y_k i$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number that satisfies the equation $-y = e^{-y\\pi(1/2+2k)}$.\n\n3.  **Other Complex Solutions**: There are other non-real, non-purely-imaginary complex solutions. For each integer $k$, any such solution $z=x+yi$ must satisfy the system of transcendental equations:\n    *   $-y = e^{-y\\pi(1/2+2k)}\\cos(x\\pi(1/2+2k))$\n    *   $x = e^{-y\\pi(1/2+2k)}\\sin(x\\pi(1/2+2k))$\n\nThe complete set of solutions is the union of these three categories.\n\n<<<The solutions are:\n1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2. An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = y_k i$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real solution to $-y = e^{-y\\pi(1/2+2k)}$.\n3. An infinite set of other complex solutions $z=x+yi$ which, for some integer $k$, satisfy the system of equations: $-y = e^{-y\\pi(1/2+2k)}\\cos(x\\pi(1/2+2k))$ and $x = e^{-y\\pi(1/2+2k)}\\sin(x\\pi(1/2+2k))$.>>>"
