The optimal combination is a **bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium** complex (e.g., Cp*2Zr(CH3)2) as the precatalyst, supported on **sulfated zirconia (SZ)**. This system creates a highly electrophilic, single-site cationic zirconium center that can efficiently polymerize olefins at moderate temperatures and, under conditions of high temperature and hydrogen pressure, can catalyze the hydrogenolysis of the polymer back into short saturated alkanes.
