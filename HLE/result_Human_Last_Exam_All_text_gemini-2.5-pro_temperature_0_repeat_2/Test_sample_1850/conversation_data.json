    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Terms\n\nFirst, we must clarify the terms in the question:\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: This refers to a person who is believed to have actually lived in history (as opposed to a purely mythological or primordial figure like Adam or an angel like Michael) and is recognized as a saint by a major branch of Christianity (e.g., Catholic, Orthodox, Coptic). This includes figures from both the Old and New Testaments, as well as post-biblical figures.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The specific name of the saint must appear in the text of *Paradise Lost*. A mere allusion to the person or their story is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Potential Candidates in the Text\n\nThe most likely place to find such names is in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of future human history. We will search the entire poem, but focus our analysis there.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Old Testament Figures\n\nMichael's historical overview begins with Adam's immediate descendants and proceeds through the history of Israel.\n\n*   **Excluded Primordial Figures**: Figures like **Abel**, **Enoch**, and **Noah** are mentioned by name. While they are considered saints, they belong to the primordial, pre-historical era of Genesis and are generally excluded from the category of \"historical\" figures in the same way as Abraham or Moses.\n*   **The Patriarchs**:\n    1.  **Abraham**: Mentioned by name in Book III and Book XII. He is a foundational historical figure and a saint.\n    2.  **Isaac**: Mentioned by name in Book XII. He is a historical patriarch and a saint.\n    3.  **Jacob**: Mentioned by name in Book XII. He is a historical patriarch and a saint.\n    4.  **Joseph**: Mentioned by name in Book XII. He is a historical patriarch and a saint.\n*   **Leaders and Prophets**:\n    5.  **Moses**: Mentioned by name in Book I and Book XII. He is a major historical figure and a saint.\n    6.  **Joshua**: Mentioned by name in Book XII. He is a historical leader and a saint.\n*   **Kings**:\n    7.  **David**: Mentioned by name in Book XII. He is a historical king and a saint.\n*   **Excluded Figure**: **Solomon** is mentioned by name, but he is traditionally not considered a saint in major Christian traditions due to his later life, when he turned to idolatry.\n\nThis gives us **seven** historical saints from the Old Testament.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing New Testament Figures\n\nMichael's prophecy continues to the time of Christ.\n\n8.  **Mary**: The mother of Jesus is mentioned by name in Book XII (\"...to a Virgin is his birth foretold, / The Virgin Mary...\"). She is the most venerated saint in Christianity.\n9.  **John (the Baptist)**: He is mentioned by name in Book XII (\"...before him shall be sent / The Baptist, his great harbinger...\"). He is a major historical figure and saint.\n\n*   **Excluded Figures**: The Apostles are mentioned as a collective (\"his twelve,\" \"his living disciples\"), and there is a clear allusion to the Apostle Paul (\"the great Apostle\"), but none of the twelve apostles or Paul are mentioned by their individual names (e.g., Peter, Andrew, Paul).\n\nThis gives us **two** historical saints from the New Testament.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing Post-Biblical Figures\n\nThe historical overview concludes with the early Church.\n\n10. **Constantine**: The Roman Emperor is mentioned by name in Book XII. Milton describes his era as a time when corruption entered the Church. However, Constantine the Great is venerated as a major saint, \"Equal to the Apostles,\" in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since the question asks how many historical saints are mentioned, not how many Milton personally endorsed, Constantine fits the criteria.\n\nThis gives us **one** post-biblical historical saint.\n\n### Step 6: Final Tally\n\nBy adding the figures from each category, we get the total count:\n*   Old Testament Saints: 7 (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, David)\n*   New Testament Saints: 2 (Mary, John the Baptist)\n*   Post-Biblical Saints: 1 (Constantine)\n\nTotal = 7 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
