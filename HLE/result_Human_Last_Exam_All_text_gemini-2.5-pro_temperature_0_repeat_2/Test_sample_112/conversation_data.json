    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the source of \"Sir Launfal\"**\nThe first step is to understand how the poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century, has survived to the present day. Like many medieval texts, it was preserved in a handwritten manuscript.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to know that \"Sir Launfal\" exists in only a single manuscript. This makes identifying its companion texts definitive.\n\n**Step 2: Name the specific manuscript**\nThe unique manuscript that contains \"Sir Launfal\" is a famous collection known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**. It is part of the Cotton library collection, now housed in the British Library.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This manuscript is a *miscellany* or an *anthology*. This means it is not a book containing a single work, but rather a collection of different poems and texts compiled by a scribe. The question \"preserved alongside\" directly refers to the other contents of this specific manuscript.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the contents of the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii**\nTo find the \"book of manners,\" we must look at the other works included in this manuscript. Besides \"Sir Launfal,\" the manuscript contains several other important Middle English works, including:\n*   *Layamon's Brut* (the earlier version)\n*   *The Owl and the Nightingale*\n*   *The Life of St. Juliana*\n*   *Dame Sirith*\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The question is not asking for any other work in the manuscript, but specifically for a \"book of manners.\" This is a distinct genre of medieval literature, also known as a courtesy book, which gives instruction on etiquette, social conduct, and morals.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the book of manners within the manuscript**\nReviewing the full list of contents for Cotton Caligula A.ii, there is one text that perfectly fits the description of a \"book of manners.\" This work is a poem on etiquette and proper behavior for a young man serving in a great household.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The title of this work is most commonly given as **The Boke of Curtasye** (or *The Book of Courtesy* in modern spelling). This is the specific text the question is asking for.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy tracing the poem \"Sir Launfal\" to its sole manuscript source, Cotton Caligula A.ii, and then examining the other texts collected within that manuscript, we can identify the specific book of manners it was preserved alongside.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
