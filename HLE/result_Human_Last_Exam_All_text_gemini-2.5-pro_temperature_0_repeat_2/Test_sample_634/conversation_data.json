    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of GCRD**\n\nLet P1(s) and P2(s) be two polynomial matrices.\n- A polynomial matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n- A matrix G(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\n- A common right divisor G(s) is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** if any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s) (i.e., G(s) = L(s)D(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s)).\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n**Step 2: The Algorithm**\n\nThe GCRD can be found by applying the Euclidean algorithm to the rows of the stacked matrix formed by P1 and P2. We form the matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] and use elementary row operations to reduce it to the form [G(s); 0], where G(s) is in a row-echelon form. The resulting matrix G(s) is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n**Step 3: Form the Stacked Matrix**\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nThe stacked matrix M(s) is:\nM(s) =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s      ]  (R1)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2     ]  (R2)\n[ s,        0       ]  (R3)\n[ -s - 1,   1       ]  (R4)\n\n**Step 4: Perform Row Reduction**\n\nOur goal is to introduce zeros into the matrix. The '1' in the second column of R4 makes it a good pivot row. We will use R4 to eliminate the second column entries in R1 and R2.\n\n*   **Operation 1: R1 -> R1 + s * R4**\n    The new R1 will be:\n    [s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]\n\n*   **Operation 2: R2 -> R2 - s^2 * R4**\n    The new R2 will be:\n    [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 - (-s^3 - s^2), s^2 - s^2] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0] = [s^3 - 1, 0]\n\nAfter these two operations, the matrix becomes:\n[ 0,        0       ]\n[ s^3 - 1,  0       ]\n[ s,        0       ]\n[ -s - 1,   1       ]\n\nNow, we work with the remaining non-zero rows. Let's call them:\nR_A = [s^3 - 1, 0]\nR_B = [s, 0]\nR_C = [-s - 1, 1]\n\nWe can simplify R_A using R_B, since the degree of the polynomial in R_B is lower. We perform polynomial division: (s^3 - 1) = s^2 * (s) - 1.\n\n*   **Operation 3: R_A -> R_A - s^2 * R_B**\n    The new R_A will be:\n    [s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2 * [s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]\n\nThe set of non-zero rows is now:\n[-1, 0]       (new R_A)\n[s, 0]        (R_B)\n[-s - 1, 1]   (R_C)\n\nNow we use the new R_A, let's call it R_A', to simplify the other rows.\n\n*   **Operation 4: R_B -> R_B + s * R_A'**\n    The new R_B will be:\n    [s, 0] + s * [-1, 0] = [s - s, 0] = [0, 0]\n\n*   **Operation 5: R_C -> R_C - (s+1) * R_A'**\n    The new R_C will be:\n    [-s - 1, 1] - (s+1) * [-1, 0] = [-s - 1 - (-s - 1), 1 - 0] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1] = [0, 1]\n\n**Step 5: Identify the GCRD**\n\nAfter all the operations, the independent non-zero rows that remain are:\n[-1, 0]\n[0, 1]\n\nWe can arrange these rows to form the GCRD matrix G(s):\nG(s) = [[-1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n**Step 6: Normalize the GCRD**\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. The matrix G(s) we found is a valid GCRD. We can check if it's unimodular:\ndet(G(s)) = (-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1.\nSince the determinant is a non-zero constant, G(s) is unimodular.\n\nWhen the GCRD is unimodular, the original matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are called **right coprime**. In such cases, it is conventional to choose the simplest possible unimodular matrix as the GCRD, which is the identity matrix I.\n\nWe can obtain the identity matrix from our G(s) by one more elementary row operation: multiplying the first row by -1.\nG_final(s) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nThis is the GCRD in its simplest, canonical form (row-reduced echelon form)."
