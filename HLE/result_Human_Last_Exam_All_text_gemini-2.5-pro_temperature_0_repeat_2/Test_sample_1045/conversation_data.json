    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the atoms in the molecule.**\nThe molecule is toluene, with the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are themselves linear combinations of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n\n*   **The hyphen (-)** separates the description of core orbitals from valence orbitals.\n*   **The first number (6)** describes the core orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single CGF, which is a sum of 6 PGFs.\n*   **The numbers after the hyphen (31)** describe the valence orbitals. This indicates that the valence shell is \"split\" into two parts (a double-zeta representation).\n    *   The **inner part** of the valence shell is represented by one CGF per atomic orbital, each contracted from 3 PGFs.\n    *   The **outer part** of the valence shell is represented by one CGF per atomic orbital, each consisting of a single, uncontracted PGF.\n*   **The 'G'** stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) for each atom type.**\n\n**For a Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   Carbon is a second-row element with electron configuration 1s², 2s², 2p².\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** The '6' in 6-31G applies here. The 1s core orbital is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s, 2p):** The '31' part applies here. The valence shell is split.\n    *   **Inner valence (2s, 2p):** Represented by the '3'. This includes one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). This gives a total of 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer valence (2s, 2p):** Represented by the '1'. This also includes one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. This gives another 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total CGFs for one Carbon atom =** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   Hydrogen is a first-row element with electron configuration 1s¹. It has no core electrons, so only the valence description applies.\n*   **Valence orbital (1s):** The '31' part applies here. The 1s orbital is split.\n    *   **Inner valence (1s):** Represented by the '3'. This gives **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Outer valence (1s):** Represented by the '1'. This gives **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total CGFs for one Hydrogen atom =** 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the toluene molecule (C7H8).**\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   (Number of C atoms) × (CGFs per C atom) = 7 × 9 = 63 CGFs\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   (Number of H atoms) × (CGFs per H atom) = 8 × 2 = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total number of CGFs:**\n    *   Total = (CGFs from Carbon) + (CGFs from Hydrogen) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Molecule Composition:** Ensure the correct number of each type of atom is used (7 C, 8 H for toluene).\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly parse the 6-31G notation for both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and hydrogen atoms. Remember that hydrogen has no core electrons.\n3.  **Distinguish CGFs from PGFs:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* functions (CGFs), which is equivalent to the number of basis functions, not the total number of *primitive* functions (PGFs).\n4.  **Count Orbitals per Shell:** Remember that for second-row atoms like Carbon, the valence shell includes both s and p orbitals (1 s-type, 3 p-type). For Hydrogen, it's just one s orbital.\n\nThe final calculation is the sum of the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n\nTotal CGFs = (7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom) + (8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
