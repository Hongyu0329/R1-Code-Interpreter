    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor $N$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime power factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhich we can write as $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a **primitive** character of conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a primitive character modulo its respective prime power $p^k$.\n\nThe **order** of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of characters $\\chi$ such that $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Component Characters\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^k})$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\nLet's determine the possible orders for each primitive component character and count the number of choices. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (where $d|n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_4$ (modulo 4):**\n    The group of characters modulo 4, $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$, is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It contains one principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and one primitive character. The primitive character must have order 2.\n    *   Possible order for primitive $\\chi_4$: 2. This divides 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_9$ (modulo 9):**\n    The group of characters $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo 3. The characters modulo 3 have orders 1 and 2. Thus, a primitive character modulo 9 must have an order that divides 6 but is not 1 or 2. The possible orders are 3 and 6. Both of these divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_7$ (modulo 7):**\n    The group $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. A character is primitive unless it is the principal character (order 1). We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders for primitive characters are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_{11}$ (modulo 11):**\n    The group $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need the order of the primitive character to divide 6. The possible orders for primitive characters are divisors of 10 (other than 1), which are 2, 5, 10. The only one that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Possible order for primitive $\\chi_{11}$: 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_{13}$ (modulo 13):**\n    The group $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need the order of the primitive character to divide 6. The possible orders for primitive characters are divisors of 12 (other than 1), which are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The ones that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\nWe need to find the total number of ways to choose the component characters such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\nLet's review the orders of the chosen components:\n*   $\\text{ord}(\\chi_4)$ must be 2.\n*   $\\text{ord}(\\chi_9)$ must be 3 or 6.\n*   $\\text{ord}(\\chi_7)$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n*   $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{11})$ must be 2.\n*   $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\nFor any combination of these choices:\n1.  The order of each component divides 6, so their lcm must divide 6.\n2.  Since $\\text{ord}(\\chi_4)=2$, the lcm is guaranteed to be a multiple of 2.\n3.  Since $\\text{ord}(\\chi_9)$ is either 3 or 6, the lcm is guaranteed to be a multiple of 3.\n\nBecause the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. Since we also know the lcm divides 6, the lcm must be exactly 6 for any valid combination of our chosen component characters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = $100$"
