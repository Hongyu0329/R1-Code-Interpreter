    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** We are looking for the name of a person.\n    *   **What:** The person's role was \"judge\".\n    *   **Where:** The location is the town of Bártfa (the historical Hungarian name for modern-day Bardejov in Slovakia).\n    *   **When:** The specific year is 1461.\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points & Historical Context:**\n    *   **Title \"Judge\":** In the context of a medieval royal free town in the Kingdom of Hungary, the \"judge\" (Latin: *judex*, Hungarian: *bíró*, German/Slovak: *richtár*) was the chief magistrate or mayor of the town. This was an elected position, usually for a one-year term.\n    *   **Location Name:** The town is known as Bardejov in Slovak and Bártfa in Hungarian. In historical Latin documents, it was often referred to as *Bartpha* or *Civitas Bartphensis*.\n    *   **Name Variations:** Due to the multilingual environment of the time (official records in Latin, with German, Hungarian, and Slovak spoken), the name of the judge might appear in different forms.\n    *   **Source of Information:** The most reliable source for this information would be the town's own administrative records, specifically the town protocol books (*mestské protokoly* or *libri prothocollorum*), where the names of elected officials were recorded annually. Historians have compiled lists from these primary sources.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer:**\n    *   **Step 1:** The first step is to consult historical records or academic works that list the judges (richtári) of Bardejov. Sources like \"Dejiny Bardejova\" (History of Bardejov) or specialized articles on the town's administration in the 15th century are key.\n    *   **Step 2:** We search these compiled lists for the entry corresponding to the year 1461.\n    *   **Step 3:** Historical records, transcribed from the town's protocol books, show that the judge elected for the year 1461 was a man named Juraj Amann.\n    *   **Step 4:** We should note the common variations of his name. In Latin, the official language of records, his name would be written as **Georgius Amann**. The name is of German origin, reflecting the significant German-speaking population in Bardejov at the time.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis of historical town records of Bártfa/Bardejov, the individual who held the office of judge (*judex* or *richtár*) in the year 1461 was Juraj Amann.\n\n<<<Juraj Amann (Georgius Amann)>>>"
