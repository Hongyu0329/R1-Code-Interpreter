    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, for a fluid with constant density $\\rho$ and constant kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, the equations for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $t$ is time, $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ are the spatial coordinates. A symmetry of these equations is a transformation of the variables $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$ that maps any solution to another solution. The set of all such symmetries forms a Lie group. We want to find the dimension of this group, which is the number of independent parameters needed to specify a transformation in the group.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Symmetries\n\nWe systematically look for continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant.\n\n**1. Time Translation**\nThe equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. Therefore, if $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(\\mathbf{u}(t+\\tau, \\mathbf{x}), p(t+\\tau, \\mathbf{x}))$ for any constant $\\tau$. This is a one-parameter group of transformations.\n*   Dimension: **1**\n\n**2. Space Translations**\nThe equations have constant coefficients and are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Thus, they are invariant under spatial translations. If $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{a}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{a}))$ for any constant vector $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a three-parameter group.\n*   Dimension: **3**\n\n**3. Space Rotations**\nThe differential operators $(\\nabla, \\nabla \\cdot, \\nabla^2)$ are invariant under rotations. The variables $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\nabla p$ transform as vectors. The entire system of equations is covariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates. If $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(R\\mathbf{u}(t, R^T\\mathbf{x}), p(t, R^T\\mathbf{x}))$ for any rotation matrix $R \\in SO(3)$. The group of rotations $SO(3)$ is three-dimensional.\n*   Dimension: **3**\n\n**4. Galilean Boosts**\nThe equations should be invariant under a change of inertial reference frame (Galilean relativity). A boost corresponds to transforming to a coordinate system moving with a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. The transformation is:\n$t' = t$\n$\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}t$\n$\\mathbf{u}'(t', \\mathbf{x}') = \\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) - \\mathbf{v}$\n$p'(t', \\mathbf{x}') = p(t, \\mathbf{x})$\nOne can verify by substitution that if $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ is a solution, then $(\\mathbf{u}', p')$ is also a solution. Since the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ can be any constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this is a three-parameter group of symmetries.\n*   Dimension: **3**\n\n**5. Scaling (Dilation)**\nLet's look for a scaling transformation of the form:\n$t' = \\lambda^a t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = \\lambda^d p$\nFor the equations to remain invariant, the scaling exponents must satisfy certain relations. Substituting these into the momentum equation and requiring all terms to scale by the same factor leads to the following system of equations for the exponents:\n*   $a-c = b-2c$ (from balancing the time derivative and the convective term)\n*   $b-2c = 2b-c$ (from balancing the convective term and the viscous term)\n*   $a-c = b-d$ (from balancing the time derivative and the pressure term, with $\\rho=1$)\n\nSolving this system gives:\n*   From the second equation: $b = -c$.\n*   Substituting into the first: $a-c = -c-2c \\implies a = -2c$.\n*   Substituting into the third: $-2c-c = -c-d \\implies d = 2c$.\n\nAll exponents are determined by a single free parameter, say $c$. This means there is a one-parameter group of scaling symmetries. A common choice is $c=-1$, which gives $a=2, b=1, d=-2$. The transformation is:\n$t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$\n*   Dimension: **1**\n\n### Step 3: Total Dimension and a Careful Point\n\nSumming the dimensions of the independent symmetries found:\nTotal Dimension = 1 (Time Translation) + 3 (Space Translations) + 3 (Rotations) + 3 (Galilean Boosts) + 1 (Scaling) = **11**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The full Lie group of point symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations is, in fact, **infinite-dimensional**. This is because the equations admit symmetries corresponding to transformations to an arbitrarily accelerating frame of reference. This transformation family is parameterized by an arbitrary vector-valued function of time $\\mathbf{g}(t)$, which introduces an infinite number of parameters. For example, the transformation $p \\to p + c(t)$ for an arbitrary function $c(t)$ is a simple symmetry that already implies an infinite-dimensional group.\n\nHowever, these infinite-dimensional symmetries are often considered \"trivial\" or \"gauge-like\" as they correspond to general principles of reference frame indifference rather than the specific structure of the Navier-Stokes dynamics. In most contexts, when asked for the dimension of the symmetry group, the question refers to the **maximal finite-dimensional subgroup**, which represents the non-trivial symmetries. The 11-dimensional group we have calculated is this maximal finite-dimensional symmetry group.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis reveals a set of fundamental, finite-dimensional symmetries:\n*   Time translations (1-dim)\n*   Space translations (3-dim)\n*   Space rotations (3-dim)\n*   Galilean boosts (3-dim)\n*   A specific scaling symmetry (1-dim)\n\nThe total dimension of this maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries is the sum of the dimensions of these subgroups.\nDimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
