    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Core Components of the Question**\n\n*   **Hand Type:** \"Suited jack\" (JXs). This means we are evaluating hands from AJs down to J2s.\n*   **Position:** \"From the button (BTN)\". This is the most profitable position in poker. We are last to act post-flop (unless the blinds check-raise), giving us a significant informational advantage. This allows us to play the widest range of hands from any position.\n*   **Action:** \"Open to 2.5x\". This is a standard opening raise size. The goal is to either steal the blinds (Small Blind and Big Blind) or to play a pot in position with initiative.\n*   **Game Conditions:** \"100BB rake-free cash game\".\n    *   **100BB:** This is the standard stack depth, meaning we are using standard deep-stacked strategies, not short-stack tournament dynamics.\n    *   **Rake-free:** This is a critical detail. Rake is the fee taken by the house from a pot. In a typical game, rake makes it unprofitable to play very marginal hands, as the small pots you win are significantly reduced. In a rake-free environment, even marginal opens become more profitable because you keep the full amount of the blinds when you successfully steal them. This encourages opening a wider range of hands.\n\n**Step 2: List and Rank All Suited Jacks**\n\nWe can list all possible suited jack combinations in descending order of raw strength:\n1.  AJs (Strongest - high card value, nut flush potential, Broadway straight potential)\n2.  KJs\n3.  QJs\n4.  JTs (Strongest suited connector with a Jack)\n5.  J9s\n6.  J8s\n7.  J7s\n8.  J6s\n9.  J5s (Has some wheel-straight potential, A-2-3-4-5)\n10. J4s\n11. J3s\n12. J2s (Weakest - lowest kicker, minimal straight connectivity)\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate these Hands as Button Opens**\n\n*   **Premium/Strong Suited Jacks (AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs):** These are exceptionally strong hands and are opened from any position, let alone the button.\n*   **Playable Suited Connectors/Gappers (J9s, J8s, J7s):** These hands have excellent playability due to their flush and straight potential. They are standard, profitable opens from the button in any game, raked or not.\n*   **Marginal Suited Jacks (J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s):** These are the hands we need to scrutinize. Their value comes primarily from their suit (flush potential) and the fact that we can steal the blinds.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Impact of the \"Rake-Free\" Rule**\n\nIn a standard game *with rake*, the profitability of opening the weakest hands like J2s, T2s, 92s, etc., is questionable. The small amount won from stealing the blinds might not be enough to compensate for the times you get called or 3-bet and have to play a very weak hand. Some strategies might advocate for folding these weakest suited hands.\n\nHowever, in a **rake-free** game, the math changes. When you raise to 2.5BB and the blinds fold, you win 1.5BB (the SB and BB) with zero rake deducted. This makes stealing the blinds highly profitable. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers for rake-free environments show that the button should open an extremely wide range, often 50% of hands or more. This range includes *every single suited hand*.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the \"Worst\" Hand that is Still an Open**\n\nSince the rake-free condition makes it profitable to open all suited hands from the button, the question \"What is the worst suited jack you should open?\" becomes \"What is the weakest hand in the JXs category?\".\n\nBy comparing the marginal suited jacks, J2s is objectively the worst.\n*   It has the lowest kicker. If you hit a Jack, you are very likely to be out-kicked by any other hand containing a Jack.\n*   It has the worst straight potential.\n*   It is dominated by every other Jx hand.\n\nTherefore, while J2s is a profitable open from the button in this specific rake-free scenario, it is the one with the lowest expected value (EV) among all suited jacks, making it the \"worst\" one.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
