    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Input Data**\n\n*   We have a 4-point sequence `x(n)` whose 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is `X(k)`.\n*   We have a 4-point sequence `h(n)` whose 4-point DFT is `H(k)`.\n*   The given DFTs are:\n    *   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**2. Understand the Goal**\n\n*   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(m)`.\n*   This new sequence is formed by interleaving the samples of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    `y(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**3. Interpret the Question: \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\"**\n\n*   This is a non-standard operation. In digital signal processing, when finding an N-point DFT of a sequence with M points (where M > N), the standard procedure is to first create an N-point sequence by aliasing the M-point sequence in the time domain.\n*   Let the 8-point sequence be `y(m)`. We create a 4-point sequence, let's call it `y_4(n)`, by wrapping and adding `y(m)`.\n    `y_4(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The problem then becomes finding the 4-point DFT of this new sequence `y_4(n)`.\n\n**4. Relate the N-point DFT to the M-point DFT (Frequency Domain Approach)**\n\n*   There is a direct relationship between the DFT of the time-aliased sequence and the DFT of the original longer sequence.\n*   Let `Y_8(k)` be the 8-point DFT of the original 8-point sequence `y(m)`.\n*   Let `Y_4(k)` be the 4-point DFT of the time-aliased 4-point sequence `y_4(n)`.\n*   The property is: `Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   This means the desired 4-point DFT consists of the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(m)`.\n*   This approach is much more direct than finding `x(n)` and `h(n)` via inverse DFTs.\n\n**5. Find the 8-point DFT, `Y_8(k)`**\n\n*   We can express the 8-point sequence `y(m)` as the sum of two other sequences:\n    1.  `x_up(m)`: The sequence `x(n)` upsampled by 2 (a zero inserted after each sample).\n        `x_up(m) = {x(0), 0, x(1), 0, x(2), 0, x(3), 0}`\n    2.  `h_up_shifted(m)`: The sequence `h(n)` upsampled by 2 and then shifted right by one sample.\n        `h_up_shifted(m) = {0, h(0), 0, h(1), 0, h(2), 0, h(3)}`\n*   So, `y(m) = x_up(m) + h_up_shifted(m)`.\n*   By the linearity of the DFT: `Y_8(k) = DFT_8{x_up(m)} + DFT_8{h_up_shifted(m)}`.\n\n*   **Applying DFT Properties:**\n    *   **Upsampling Property:** The M*L-point DFT of a sequence upsampled by L is the M-point DFT repeated L times. Here, M=4, L=2.\n        `DFT_8{x_up(m)} = X(k mod 4)`\n    *   **Time-Shift Property:** `DFT{z(n-n0)} = Z(k) * W_N^(k*n0)`.\n        `DFT_8{h_up_shifted(m)} = DFT_8{h_up(m-1)} = (DFT_8{h_up(m)}) * W_8^k`\n        Combining with the upsampling property:\n        `DFT_8{h_up_shifted(m)} = H(k mod 4) * W_8^k`\n\n*   **Combining these results, we get the formula for `Y_8(k)`:**\n    `Y_8(k) = X(k mod 4) + H(k mod 4) * W_8^k`\n\n**6. Calculate the Required DFT points**\n\n*   We need to find `Y_4(k) = {Y_8(0), Y_8(2), Y_8(4), Y_8(6)}`.\n*   We need the twiddle factors `W_N^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/N)`.\n    *   `W_8^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*pi*2/8) = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n    *   `W_8^4 = e^(-j*2*pi*4/8) = e^(-j*pi) = -1`\n    *   `W_8^6 = e^(-j*2*pi*6/8) = e^(-j*3*pi/2) = j`\n\n*   **Calculation for k=0:**\n    `Y_4(0) = Y_8(0) = X(0) + H(0) * W_8^0 = 1 + 0 * 1 = 1`\n\n*   **Calculation for k=1:**\n    `Y_4(1) = Y_8(2) = X(2) + H(2) * W_8^2 = -1 + 1 * (-j) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Calculation for k=2:**\n    `Y_4(2) = Y_8(4) = X(4 mod 4) + H(4 mod 4) * W_8^4 = X(0) + H(0) * (-1) = 1 + 0 * (-1) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculation for k=3:**\n    `Y_4(3) = Y_8(6) = X(6 mod 4) + H(6 mod 4) * W_8^6 = X(2) + H(2) * (j) = -1 + 1 * (j) = -1 + j`\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\n*   Assembling the calculated points, the 4-point DFT is:\n    `Y_4(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correct Interpretation:** The key is correctly interpreting \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\" as time-domain aliasing, which corresponds to selecting even-indexed samples from the 8-point DFT.\n2.  **Correct DFT Properties:** The properties for upsampling and time-shifting must be applied correctly with respect to the DFT length (N=8).\n3.  **Modulus Operation:** Remember that for `Y_8(k)`, the indices for `X` and `H` are `k mod 4`. For example, for `Y_8(6)`, we use `X(2)` and `H(2)`.\n4.  **Twiddle Factors:** Use the correct twiddle factors for N=8 (`W_8^k`), not N=4.\n5.  **Efficiency:** The frequency-domain method used here is significantly more efficient than the time-domain method (calculating IDFTs, forming the new sequence, then calculating its DFT), and it is less prone to arithmetic errors.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
