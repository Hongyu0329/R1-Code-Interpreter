    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Musical Terminology\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major.\n*   **Fifth Chord (V):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a major key, this chord is naturally a major chord (called the dominant). For example, in C major, the fifth note is G, and the V chord is G major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is where the question gets specific. It asks for a *minor* chord built on the fifth note. Using our C major example, a minor fifth chord would be G minor. This is a non-diatonic chord (it contains a note, Bb, that is not in the C major scale). It is \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key (C minor). This I → v progression (e.g., C major to G minor) creates a distinct, often melancholic or wistful sound.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Question\n\nThe question asks for a Beatles song that *starts* with a \"chord jump\" from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth (v). This means we are looking for a song in a major key where the very first or second chord is this borrowed minor fifth chord.\n\n### Step 3: Examining Potential Beatles Songs\n\nLet's analyze the introductions of some famous Beatles songs to see if they match this pattern.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famous, complex dissonant chord (often analyzed as a G7sus4 with an F in the bass). This is not a I → v progression.\n*   **\"Help!\":** The key is A major. The opening vocal harmony sings the chords G#m → B → A. This is vii° → V → I in relation to the verse key. The guitar part plays A → C#m → F#m. This is I → iii → vi. Neither fits.\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** The key is F major. The song starts on the tonic F major chord. The progression is F → Em7 → A7 → Dm. This is I → vii7 → III7 → vi. It does not go to a minor fifth.\n*   **\"Michelle\":** This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   The song is in the key of **F major**.\n    *   The tonic chord (I) is **F major**.\n    *   The fifth note of the F major scale is C. The standard dominant chord (V) would be C major.\n    *   A **minor fifth chord (v)** in this key would be **C minor**.\n    *   The song's famous opening vocal line, \"Michelle, ma belle,\" is sung over the chords **F major** followed immediately by **C minor**.\n    *   This is a perfect example of a I → v progression right at the start of the song.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe song \"Michelle\" begins in the key of F major (the tonic). The very next chord that accompanies the start of the singing is C minor, which is the minor fifth (v) chord in the key of F. This chord jump is a defining feature of the song's introduction and main theme.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n1.  **Major vs. Minor Key:** The progression is most distinctive in a major key (I → v) because the minor chord is \"borrowed.\" In a natural minor key, the fifth chord is already minor (i → v), which is a very common and less remarkable progression. The question implies the more striking major-key version.\n2.  **\"Starts With\":** The progression must be a primary feature of the song's introduction, not something that appears later in a verse or bridge. \"Michelle\" fits this perfectly as it's the first harmonic change of the main song structure.\n3.  **The \"Jump\":** The term \"jump\" aptly describes the shift in mood from the stable, bright F major tonic to the more somber, unexpected C minor chord.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct song is \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
