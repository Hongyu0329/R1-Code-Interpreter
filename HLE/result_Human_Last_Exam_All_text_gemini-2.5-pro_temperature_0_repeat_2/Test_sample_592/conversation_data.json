    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the specific US city that the character Tommaso moves to in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n\n*   **Film:** *Ovosodo* (English title: *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Information needed:** The name of the US city.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Characters and Plot Points**\nTo answer the question, we need to understand the plot of *Ovosodo*, particularly the storyline of the character Tommaso. The film's protagonist is Piero Mansani, and Tommaso Paladini is his best friend from a wealthy family. Their differing backgrounds and life choices are central to the film's theme.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Tommaso's Character Arc**\nA significant event in the movie is when Tommaso, after finishing school, decides to leave his hometown of Livorno, Italy, to pursue opportunities abroad. This marks a major turning point in his friendship with Piero, who stays behind.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Destination**\nThe film explicitly states Tommaso's destination. He moves to the United States to live in a major city that represents opportunity and a departure from his provincial Italian life. By consulting plot summaries and reviews of the film, we can confirm his destination.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Specific City**\nThe city that Tommaso moves to in the United States is New York City. This move highlights the diverging paths of the two friends—Tommaso embracing a cosmopolitan life in a global metropolis, while Piero remains in Livorno.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Character Distinction:** It is important not to confuse the character in the question, Tommaso, with the film's protagonist, Piero. The question is specifically about Tommaso's journey.\n2.  **Specificity:** The question asks for a specific city, not just the country. Simply stating \"the United States\" would be an incomplete answer.\n3.  **Source Verification:** The information should be confirmed by referencing reliable sources such as film databases (IMDb), encyclopedias, or detailed movie synopses to ensure accuracy.\n4.  **Film Details:** Confirming the film's title (*Ovosodo*), year (1997), and the actor (Marco Cocci) helps ensure we are analyzing the correct movie and character.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
