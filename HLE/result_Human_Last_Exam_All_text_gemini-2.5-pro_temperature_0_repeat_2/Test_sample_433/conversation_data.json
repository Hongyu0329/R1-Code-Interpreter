    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, a list of careful points, and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Components of the Question:**\n    *   **Item:** Single-dose container ampule.\n    *   **Action:** Punctured (i.e., opened by breaking the glass neck).\n    *   **Environment:** Sterile environment (implying an ISO Class 5 or better Primary Engineering Control like a laminar airflow workbench).\n    *   **Question:** What is the Beyond-Use Date (BUD)?\n\n2.  **Define the Terms:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** The date and time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) must not be used. It is determined from the time the preparation is compounded or the container is opened.\n    *   **Ampule:** A sealed glass container holding a sterile medication. To access the medication, the glass neck is broken. It is an \"open system\" once broken and cannot be resealed to maintain sterility.\n\n3.  **Consult the Governing Standard:**\n    The primary standard for sterile compounding in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations.\"\n\n4.  **Apply the Specific USP <797> Rule:**\n    USP <797> has distinct rules for different types of single-dose containers. The key distinction is between a vial (with a resealable rubber stopper) and an ampule (which cannot be resealed).\n    *   **For Single-Dose Vials:** The 2023 revision of USP <797> allows a single-dose vial (SDV) that has been punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment to be used for up to 12 hours.\n    *   **For Ampules:** This 12-hour rule **does not apply** to ampules. Once an ampule is opened, it is an open system directly exposed to the surrounding air. Even in an ultra-clean ISO Class 5 environment, the risk of contamination is considered too high to allow for storage. Therefore, the contents of an opened ampule must be used immediately.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Because an ampule cannot be resealed, it must be used immediately after opening. The sterile environment is the required setting for opening the ampule and drawing up its contents to minimize contamination during the process, but it does not grant an extended BUD for storage. Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded immediately after the required dose is withdrawn. There is no allowable storage time.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** This is the most critical distinction. The rules are different. Do not apply the 12-hour rule for single-dose vials to ampules.\n*   **\"Immediate Use\":** This is the official guideline. It means the contents must be used without any delay or interruption in the compounding process. While some may interpret this as \"within one hour,\" the strictest and safest practice is to use it right away.\n*   **No Storage Permitted:** The concept of a BUD implies a period of allowable storage. For an opened ampule, there is no such period.\n*   **Discard Unused Portion:** It is mandatory to discard any medication remaining in the ampule after the dose has been withdrawn. It cannot be saved for later use.\n*   **Purpose of the Sterile Environment:** The sterile environment (ISO Class 5) is essential to protect the drug from contamination *during the act* of opening and withdrawing the dose, not to allow for storage afterward.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule after it has been opened, even in a sterile environment, is **immediate use**. The contents must be withdrawn and used without delay. There is no allowable storage time, and any unused portion must be discarded immediately.\n\n<<<Immediate use. The contents must be used without delay and any unused portion must be discarded.>>>"
