**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**
The equilibrium mean energy is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation:
`U = (8π⁵ k_B⁴ / (15 h³c³)) * V * T⁴`

**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**
The equilibrium entropy is given by:
`S = (32π⁵ k_B⁴ / (45 h³c³)) * V * T³`

Here, `V` is the volume, `T` is the absolute temperature, `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is the Planck constant, and `c` is the speed of light.
