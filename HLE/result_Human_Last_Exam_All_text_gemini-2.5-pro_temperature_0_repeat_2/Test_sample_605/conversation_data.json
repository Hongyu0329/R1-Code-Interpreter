    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Calabi-Yau Link:** This refers to the manifold at the intersection of the singular hypersurface defined by the polynomial equation $f(z_1, ..., z_5) = 0$ and the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{C}^5$. The properties of this link are determined by the polynomial and the weights.\n*   **Weighted Projective Space:** The ambient space is the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$, where the weights are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n*   **Weighted Homogeneous Polynomial:** A polynomial $f$ is weighted homogeneous of degree $d$ if every monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_5^{a_5}$ in $f$ has the same weighted degree, calculated as $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i w_i = d$.\n*   **Calabi-Yau Condition:** For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space to be Calabi-Yau, its degree $d$ must be equal to the sum of the weights of the ambient space, i.e., $d = \\sum w_i$.\n*   **Crawley-Nordström Invariant:** For the link of a weighted homogeneous polynomial singularity (which is a quasi-regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold), the invariant `cn` is given by the formula:\n    $cn = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i$\n\n**2. List the Careful Points**\n\n*   **Verify Weighted Homogeneity:** The first and most crucial step is to check if the given polynomial is indeed weighted homogeneous with respect to the given weights. The entire framework relies on this property.\n*   **Identify the Degree (d):** If the polynomial is weighted homogeneous, its degree $d$ is the common weighted degree of all its monomials.\n*   **Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition:** We must check if the condition $d = \\sum w_i$ holds. The problem statement asserts it's a \"Calabi-Yau Link\", implying this condition should be met.\n*   **Handle Discrepancies:** If the polynomial is not perfectly weighted homogeneous, we must analyze the situation. Often in such problems, this indicates a typo. We should proceed based on the most consistent data.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Check for Weighted Homogeneity and Determine the Degree `d`**\n\n    Let's calculate the weighted degree for each monomial in the polynomial:\n    $f = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n    The weights are $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n    *   Monomial 1: $z_1^8z_3 \\implies 8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n    *   Monomial 2: $z_1^4z_2^3z_3 \\implies 4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n    *   Monomial 3: $z_1z_2^7 \\implies 1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1(22) + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$\n    *   Monomial 4: $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 \\implies 1 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 + 1 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$\n    *   Monomial 5: $z_2z_3^4 \\implies 1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$\n    *   Monomial 6: $z_4^3z_5 \\implies 3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n    *   Monomial 7: $z_5^3 \\implies 3 \\cdot w_5 = 3(75) = 225$\n\n    **Observation:** All monomials have a weighted degree of 225, except for the second monomial ($z_1^4z_2^3z_3$), which has a degree of 224. This indicates the polynomial as written is not weighted homogeneous. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. Given that 6 out of 7 terms have degree 225, we will proceed assuming the intended degree of the homogeneous polynomial is **d = 225**.\n\n*   **Step B: Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition**\n\n    Now, we check if the degree $d=225$ satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition, $d = \\sum w_i$.\n    Sum of weights:\n    $\\sum w_i = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5 = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75$\n    $\\sum w_i = 51 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 100 + 125 = 225$\n\n    Since $d = 225$ and $\\sum w_i = 225$, the Calabi-Yau condition is satisfied. This strongly supports our assumption that $d=225$ is the correct degree.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\n\n    Using the formula for the invariant:\n    $cn = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i$\n\n    We substitute the values we found:\n    $d = 225$\n    $\\sum w_i = 225$\n\n    $cn = \\frac{225}{225} = 1$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for any link that satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition ($d = \\sum w_i$) is always 1. Our analysis confirms that this condition holds for the given weights and the overwhelmingly implied degree of the polynomial.\n\n<<<1>>>"
