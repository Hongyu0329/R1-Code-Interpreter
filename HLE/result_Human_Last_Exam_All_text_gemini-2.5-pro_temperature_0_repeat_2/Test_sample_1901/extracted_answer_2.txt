A successful design for a single-benzene-ring liquid crystal with nematic or smectic phases near room temperature must correct the flawed assumption that a simple `Alkyl-Ph-CN` structure is sufficient. The molecule requires greater anisotropy, which can be achieved by incorporating a linking group. A robust design would be based on the **4-alkoxybenzonitrile (`CnH2n+1-O-Ph-CN`)** family. To achieve the desired room temperature transitions, it is necessary to formulate a **eutectic mixture** of several compounds from this family, typically with varying alkyl chain lengths (`n`) and incorporating **lateral fluoro-substituents** on the benzene ring to depress the melting point and stabilize the liquid crystal phase at ambient temperatures.
