    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Theoretical Framework:** The question is set in the context of finite-temperature quantum field theory, specifically for a neutral scalar field $\\phi$. The mathematical tool is the functional integral (or path integral) representation of the partition function, $Z$.\n\n2.  **The Partition Function and Euclidean Action:** At a finite temperature $T$, the partition function $Z$ is given by a functional integral over field configurations in Euclidean spacetime. The time coordinate is Wick-rotated to imaginary time, $\\tau = it$, which is compactified to a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$.\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n    The integral is over all field configurations $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$ that are periodic in imaginary time: $\\phi(0, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\vec{x})$. This periodicity is a crucial boundary condition for bosonic fields.\n\n3.  **The Euclidean Action for a Scalar Field:** For a free, neutral scalar field with mass $m$, the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is:\n    $\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2$\n    The Euclidean action $S_E[\\phi]$ is the integral of this Lagrangian over the Euclidean spacetime volume:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n4.  **The Inner Product Form of the Action:** The quadratic part of the action, which describes the free theory, is often written in a compact form using an inner product notation:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$\n    Here, $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ denotes an inner product on the space of field configurations, and $D_\\phi$ is a differential operator.\n\n5.  **Defining the Inner Product:** The standard definition of the inner product for two real scalar fields, $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$, in this context is the integral of their product over the spacetime volume:\n    $(\\phi_1, \\phi_2) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi_1(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\phi_2(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n6.  **Deriving the Operator $D_\\phi$:** To find the explicit form of the operator $D_\\phi$, we must manipulate the action $S_E[\\phi]$ into the form $\\frac{1}{2} \\int \\phi (D_\\phi \\phi)$. This is achieved through integration by parts.\n    *   For the time derivative term: $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 = [\\phi \\partial_\\tau \\phi]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi)$. The boundary term vanishes due to the periodicity of $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$.\n    *   For the spatial derivative term: $\\int d^3x (\\nabla \\phi)^2 = \\int d\\vec{S} \\cdot (\\phi \\nabla \\phi) - \\int d^3x \\, \\phi (\\nabla^2 \\phi)$. The boundary term (a surface integral at spatial infinity) vanishes for physically relevant fields that decay at infinity.\n    *   Substituting these results back into the action gives:\n        $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ -\\phi(\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi) - \\phi(\\nabla^2 \\phi) + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n        $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n7.  **Identifying the Inner Product $(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$:** Comparing the expression above with $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$ and the definition of the inner product, we can identify the operator as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$\n    The question asks for the expression for $(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$. From our derivation, we see that:\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n    This expression is exactly equal to $2S_E[\\phi]$. Therefore, we can also write it in its original form before integration by parts.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Euclidean vs. Minkowski:** The calculation is performed in Euclidean spacetime, which is why the operator is $-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2$ (an elliptic operator) and not the d'Alembertian $\\partial_t^2 - \\nabla^2$ (a hyperbolic operator).\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The periodicity in imaginary time for bosons is fundamental. It ensures that boundary terms from integration by parts vanish, allowing the action to be written in terms of the second-order operator $D_\\phi$.\n*   **Free Theory:** This analysis applies to the quadratic (free) part of the action. Interactions (e.g., a $\\phi^4$ term) are not included in this inner product structure and are treated as higher-order terms in the exponential $e^{-S_E}$.\n*   **The Result is a Functional:** The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$ is not a single number but a functional that depends on the specific field configuration $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$. Its value is precisely twice the Euclidean action for that configuration.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$ is the quadratic part of the Euclidean action, which can be expressed in two equivalent ways:\n\n1.  Using the differential operator $D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$:\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n2.  In terms of first derivatives of the field (which is equal to $2S_E[\\phi]$):\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nBoth expressions represent the same quantity. The second form is often more direct.\n\n<<<The inner product is given by the expression $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$. This is equivalent to twice the Euclidean action for the free field, $2S_E[\\phi]$.>>>"
