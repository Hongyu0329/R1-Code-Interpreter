    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the definitions of Sidon sets and Hausdorff dimension, and how they relate to each other for sets within the real interval [0, 1].\n\n### Step 1: Defining a Sidon Set in the Reals\n\nFirst, let's clarify the terms.\nA set of integers $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ is called a **Sidon set** (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums are unique up to permutation. That is, if $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \\in A$, the equation $a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4$ implies that the multisets $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and $\\{a_3, a_4\\}$ are identical. This means either $(a_1=a_3, a_2=a_4)$ or $(a_1=a_4, a_2=a_3)$.\n\nThis definition can be directly generalized to subsets of the real numbers. A set $S \\subset [0, 1]$ is a **Sidon set** if for any $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \\in S$, the equality $s_1 + s_2 = s_3 + s_4$ implies $\\{s_1, s_2\\} = \\{s_3, s_4\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Defining Hausdorff Dimension\n\nThe **Hausdorff dimension**, denoted $\\dim_H(S)$, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $S$. It can be a non-integer value. For a finite set, the dimension is 0. For a line segment, it is 1. For the standard middle-thirds Cantor set, it is $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.63$.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible value of $\\dim_H(S)$ for any set $S \\subset [0, 1]$ that is a Sidon set.\n\n### Step 3: Finding an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nThis is a classic result in harmonic analysis and fractal geometry, first established by Jean-Pierre Kahane in 1968.\n\n**Theorem (Kahane, 1968):** If $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is a compact Sidon set, then its Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(S)$ is at most $1/2$.\n\nThe proof is quite technical and relies on Fourier analysis. Here is a sketch of the argument:\n1.  Let $S$ be a Sidon set and $\\mu$ be a probability measure supported on $S$. Let $\\hat{\\mu}(t) = \\int_S e^{-itx} d\\mu(x)$ be its Fourier transform.\n2.  The Sidon property of $S$ implies that the $L^4$ norm of the Fourier transform, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\hat{\\mu}(t)|^4 dt$, is finite for any non-atomic measure $\\mu$ on $S$. This is because this integral relates to the number of solutions to the equation $s_1 + s_2 = s_3 + s_4$, which is constrained by the Sidon property.\n3.  On the other hand, a fundamental result (related to Frostman's lemma) connects the Hausdorff dimension of a set to the decay rate of the Fourier transform of measures it supports. If $\\dim_H(S) = d$, then for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a measure $\\mu$ on $S$ such that $|\\hat{\\mu}(t)| = O(|t|^{-(d-\\epsilon)/2})$ as $|t| \\to \\infty$.\n4.  If we assume $\\dim_H(S) = d > 1/2$, we can choose $\\epsilon$ small enough such that $d-\\epsilon > 1/2$.\n5.  For the measure from step 3, we would have $|\\hat{\\mu}(t)|^4 = O(|t|^{-2(d-\\epsilon)})$.\n6.  The integral $\\int^{\\infty} t^{-2(d-\\epsilon)} dt$ converges because the exponent $2(d-\\epsilon)$ is greater than 1. This means $\\int |\\hat{\\mu}(t)|^4 dt$ would be finite.\n7.  The full argument by Kahane is more robust and shows a contradiction arises from assuming $\\dim_H(S) > 1/2$. Specifically, he showed that for any measure on a Sidon set, its Fourier transform cannot be in $L^p$ for any $p<4$. However, if the dimension is greater than $1/2$, one can find a measure whose Fourier transform is in $L^p$ for some $p<4$. This contradiction establishes the upper bound.\n\nSo, we have a firm upper bound: **$\\dim_H(S) \\le 1/2$**.\n\n### Step 4: Finding a Lower Bound (Construction)\n\nTo show that $1/2$ is the maximum possible dimension, we need to demonstrate that a Sidon set $S \\subset [0, 1]$ with $\\dim_H(S) = 1/2$ actually exists. If we can construct such a set, we know that the maximum is at least $1/2$.\n\nThis was an open problem for some time until it was solved by Stephen Astels in 1999.\n\n**Theorem (Astels, 1999):** There exists a Sidon set $S \\subset [0, 1]$ with Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(S) = 1/2$.\n\nThe construction is intricate and involves a randomized process to build a generalized Cantor set. Here is a simplified overview of the idea:\n1.  The set $S$ is constructed as the set of numbers of the form $x = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_j}{M_j}$, where $M_j = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\cdots \\lambda_j$. This is a number represented in a mixed-radix system with bases $\\lambda_j$.\n2.  The \"digits\" $d_j$ are chosen from a set $D_j \\subset \\{0, 1, \\dots, \\lambda_j-1\\}$.\n3.  The key is to choose the bases $\\lambda_j$ and the digit sets $D_j$ very carefully.\n    *   The bases $\\lambda_j$ are chosen to be a very rapidly increasing sequence of integers. This ensures that the representation of numbers in $S$ is unique and that the arithmetic property ($s_1+s_2=s_3+s_4$) can be analyzed digit by digit.\n    *   The digit sets $D_j$ are chosen randomly. For each $j$, $D_j$ is a random subset of $\\{0, 1, \\dots, \\lambda_j-1\\}$ of size $m_j = \\lfloor \\sqrt{\\lambda_j} \\rfloor$.\n4.  Astels showed that if the sequence $\\lambda_j$ grows fast enough, the resulting set $S$ is a Sidon set with positive probability. This is because the rapid growth ensures that $s_1+s_2=s_3+s_4$ implies $d_{1j}+d_{2j}=d_{3j}+d_{4j}$ for each digit, and the random choice of $D_j$ ensures that each $D_j$ is itself an integer Sidon set (with high probability).\n5.  The Hausdorff dimension of the constructed set is given by $\\liminf_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^k \\log m_j}{\\log M_k}$. By controlling the growth rate of the $\\lambda_j$, this dimension can be made to be exactly $1/2$. For instance, if $\\log M_{k-1} / \\log \\lambda_k \\to 0$, the dimension is $\\limsup_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log m_k}{\\log \\lambda_k} = \\limsup_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log \\lfloor \\sqrt{\\lambda_k} \\rfloor}{\\log \\lambda_k} = 1/2$.\n\nThis construction proves that a Sidon set of dimension $1/2$ exists.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from Step 3 and Step 4:\n*   The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ is at most $1/2$.\n*   There exists at least one Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ with a Hausdorff dimension of exactly $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
