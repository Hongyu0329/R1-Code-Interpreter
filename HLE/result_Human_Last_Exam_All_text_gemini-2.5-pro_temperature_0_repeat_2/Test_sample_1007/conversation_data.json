    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\nThe core of the question is to identify the ballet step from the given options where the configuration of the legs (which foot is in front, the position itself, e.g., fifth) is identical at the beginning and at the end of the movement.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** The step typically begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Entrechat\" means \"interweaving\" or \"braiding.\" The number \"six\" refers to six movements of the legs crossing in the air. The dancer jumps vertically, and the legs beat three times.\n    1.  Jump from fifth, legs open slightly.\n    2.  Beat the back leg in front.\n    3.  Open again.\n    4.  Beat the original front leg back in front.\n    5.  Open again.\n    6.  Close back into the starting fifth position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the exact same fifth position they started from, with the right foot still in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** Even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) always land in the same position from which they started. Odd-numbered entrechats (trois, cinq) land on one foot.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Begins in a closed position, typically fifth. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   `Échappé`: \"To escape.\" The dancer jumps and opens the legs to second position.\n    *   `battu`: \"Beaten.\" As the legs close back to fifth, they beat against each other.\n    *   `changé`: \"Changed.\" This is the key term. It explicitly indicates that the feet will change their position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but because of the `changé`, the left foot will now be in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** The word `changé` in the name of a step is a direct instruction that the feet must swap their front/back relationship.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Can begin from fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in fifth position.\n    *   In an `assemblé dessus` (over), the back leg brushes to the side and lands in front.\n    *   In an `assemblé dessous` (under), the front leg brushes to the side and lands in the back.\n*   **Ending Position:** In both common cases, the feet have changed their front/back position. If starting with the right foot front, the step will end with the left foot front.\n*   **Careful Point:** While there are less common variations, the standard `assemblé` is a traveling step that changes the feet.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide.\" `Derrière` means \"behind.\"\n    1.  The back foot (left) glides out to the side.\n    2.  The dancer transfers weight onto that foot.\n    3.  The other foot (the original front foot, right) glides to close *behind* the new supporting foot.\n*   **Ending Position:** The step finishes in fifth position, but now the left foot is in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** A `glissade` is a connecting step that almost always changes which foot is in front to prepare for the next movement. `Glissade derrière` specifically causes the front foot to end up in the back.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step, often described as a `pas de chat` with a double `rond de jambe`. The first leg performs a `rond de jambe en l'air` as it's drawn up, and the second leg does the same as it follows. The dancer lands on the first foot, and the second foot closes in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The step ends in fifth position, but with the opposite foot (the left foot) now in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** Like a `pas de chat`, the fundamental movement involves one leg passing the other, resulting in a change of feet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter analyzing all the options, the only step that, by definition, concludes with the legs in the same position as they started is the **Entrechat six**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
