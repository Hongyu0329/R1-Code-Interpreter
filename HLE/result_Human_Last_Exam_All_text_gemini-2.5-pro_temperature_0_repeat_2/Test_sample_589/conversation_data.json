    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\nThe query asks for a specific Hollywood feature film from a major studio with four key identifying elements:\n1.  The character is a **teenager**.\n2.  The character is riding a **pink bike**.\n3.  The character **pedals directly toward** an oncoming vehicle.\n4.  The vehicle is a **car**.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate common film candidates that involve teenagers and bikes.**\n\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** This film features iconic scenes of kids and teenagers on bikes, including a confrontation with government cars at a roadblock. They do ride toward the cars to evade them. However, none of the bikes are pink.\n*   ***Better Off Dead...* (1985):** This teen comedy has a very memorable scene that almost fits perfectly. A character on a small, pink bicycle does pedal directly into the path of the protagonist's car. However, the rider is a small child (the paperboy's little brother, Egg), not a teenager. So, this fails on the \"teenager\" criterion.\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure* (1985):** The film is centered around a famous bicycle, but the bike is red and white, not pink. The main character is an adult with a childlike personality, not a teenager. There is no scene that matches the described action.\n*   ***It* (2017):** The main characters are teenagers (the Losers' Club) who rely on their bikes. However, none of the bikes are pink, and there is no specific scene where one of them pedals head-on toward a car in this manner.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the most likely candidate, *Napoleon Dynamite* (2004).**\n\nThis film is a cult classic produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures (a subsidiary of a major studio) and is strongly associated with a quirky teenager and his bicycle. Let's check the criteria carefully.\n\n1.  **Teenager:** Yes, the protagonist, Napoleon Dynamite, is a high school teenager.\n2.  **Vehicle Confrontation:** Yes, there are two notable scenes involving Napoleon on his bike and a vehicle.\n    *   **Scene A (The Steak):** Uncle Rico, riding in a van driven by Kip, throws a steak at Napoleon, who is riding his bike on the side of the road. This is a confrontation, but Napoleon is riding parallel to the van, not *toward* it.\n    *   **Scene B (Rex Kwon Do Training):** Kip, as part of his \"cage fighter\" training, deliberately drives his grandmother's car at Napoleon, who is on his bike, to test his reflexes. In this case, the car is moving toward the teenager on the bike, not the other way around. The teenager is evading the car, not pedaling toward it in an act of defiance.\n3.  **Pink Bike:** This is a critical point of failure. Napoleon's bike is a reddish-orange Huffy. The character Deb has a bike, but it is not featured in an action scene, and its color is a very light, faded shade that is not distinctly pink. Pedro's bike is blue.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion based on careful analysis.**\n\nAfter a detailed breakdown, no major Hollywood film perfectly matches all four specific criteria laid out in the question. The question appears to be flawed, likely combining elements from different films or from a misremembered scene.\n\nHowever, the combination of a quirky teenager, an iconic bike scene, and a confrontation with a vehicle is most famously and culturally associated with **Napoleon Dynamite**. While the specific details of the bike's color and the direction of action are incorrect, the film's central character and plot points align more broadly with the query's theme than any other candidate. The iconic scene where Uncle Rico throws a steak from the van at Napoleon on his bike is the most probable source of this question, despite the factual inaccuracies in the prompt's details.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
