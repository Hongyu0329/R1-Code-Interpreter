To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. At night and in the early morning before sunrise, the table should be in a straight, elongated form, representing the stable *trans*-azobenzene isomer. When the sun rises and its UV rays hit the table, it must bend in the middle to form a V-shape, mimicking the light-induced isomerization to the *cis*-azobenzene form. When the sun sets and the UV light disappears, the table must return to its original straight shape, mimicking the thermal relaxation of the molecule back to its stable *trans* state.
