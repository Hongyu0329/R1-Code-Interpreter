    "Answering this question involves several steps of analysis, including transforming the problem into a more convenient coordinate system and applying concepts from convex geometry.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Condition:**\n    The problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n    The condition `K \\cap \\{ (x,y) | px+qy=1 \\} \\neq \\emptyset` for all such `(p,q)` means that for every pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, the value `1` must be within the range of the function `f(x,y) = px+qy` over the domain `K`.\n\n2.  **A Candidate Solution:**\n    Let's test a simple convex shape. Consider the square `S'` defined by `|x| + |y| \\le 1`. This is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. Its area is `(sqrt(2))^2 = 2`.\n    For any line `px + qy = 1`, we need to check if it intersects `S'`. The range of `px+qy` on `S'` is `[-max(|p|, |q|), max(|p|, |q|)]`.\n    The intersection condition requires `1` to be in this range, which means `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1`.\n    Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. Thus, at least one of `|p|` or `|q|` must be at least 1. This implies `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1`.\n    So, the square `S'` with area 2 satisfies the condition. This means the minimal area is at most 2.\n\n3.  **Transforming the Problem:**\n    To prove that the area must be at least 2, we can use an affine transformation to simplify the set of lines. Let's define a new coordinate system `(u,v)`:\n    `u = x + y`\n    `v = x - y`\n    This is a linear transformation `T(x,y) = (u,v)`. The inverse transformation is `x = (u+v)/2`, `y = (u-v)/2`.\n    The Jacobian determinant of the inverse transformation is `| (1/2)(1/2) - (1/2)(-1/2) | = 1/2`.\n    If `K` is the convex domain in the `xy`-plane, let `K' = T(K)` be its image in the `uv`-plane. The relationship between their areas is `Area(K) = (1/2) Area(K')`.\n    The line `px + qy = 1` is transformed into:\n    `p((u+v)/2) + q((u-v)/2) = 1`\n    `(p+q)u + (p-q)v = 2`\n    Let `P = p+q` and `Q = p-q`. The condition is that `K'` must intersect the line `Pu + Qv = 2` for all `P, Q` that can be formed from coprime integers `p,q`.\n\n4.  **Finding Constraints on the Transformed Domain K':**\n    Let's find the lines in the `uv`-plane corresponding to some simple choices of `(p,q)`:\n    *   `p=1, q=1` (`gcd=1`): `P=2, Q=0`. Line: `2u = 2` -> `u = 1`.\n    *   `p=-1, q=-1` (`gcd=1`): `P=-2, Q=0`. Line: `-2u = 2` -> `u = -1`.\n    *   `p=1, q=-1` (`gcd=1`): `P=0, Q=2`. Line: `2v = 2` -> `v = 1`.\n    *   `p=-1, q=1` (`gcd=1`): `P=0, Q=-2`. Line: `-2v = 2` -> `v = -1`.\n    Since `K'` must intersect these four lines, its width in the `u` direction (`w_u`) must be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`, and its width in the `v` direction (`w_v`) must be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n5.  **Finding a Lower Bound for the Area:**\n    The area of a convex set `K'` with horizontal width `w_u` and vertical width `w_v` can be calculated by integrating its vertical cross-sections: `Area(K') = \\int_{u_{min}}^{u_{max}} f(u) du`, where `f(u)` is the length of the vertical slice at `u`. The function `f(u)` is concave. The length of its support is `w_u`, and its maximum value is `w_v`.\n    For a non-negative concave function `f` on an interval `[a,b]`, the area under its curve is bounded below by the area of a triangle with the same base and height: `Area \\ge (1/2) \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}`.\n    So, `Area(K') \\ge (1/2) w_u w_v`.\n    Using the constraints from the previous step, `w_u \\ge 2` and `w_v \\ge 2`.\n    `Area(K') \\ge (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n    This gives `Area(K) = (1/2) Area(K') \\ge (1/2) * 2 = 1`. This bound is not tight enough.\n\n6.  **Using More Constraints and a Stronger Theorem:**\n    Let's consider more lines:\n    *   `p=1, q=0` (`gcd=1`): `P=1, Q=1`. Line: `u+v = 2`.\n    *   `p=-1, q=0` (`gcd=1`): `P=-1, Q=-1`. Line: `u+v = -2`.\n    *   `p=0, q=1` (`gcd=1`): `P=1, Q=-1`. Line: `u-v = 2`.\n    *   `p=0, q=-1` (`gcd=1`): `P=-1, Q=1`. Line: `u-v = -2`.\n    `K'` must intersect these lines. This implies that the width of `K'` in the diagonal direction `(1,1)`, `w_{\\pi/4}`, must be at least the distance between the parallel lines `u+v=2` and `u+v=-2`. This distance is `(2 - (-2)) / \\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = 4/\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}`.\n    Similarly, the width of `K'` in the anti-diagonal direction `(1,-1)`, `w_{3\\pi/4}`, must be at least `2\\sqrt{2}`.\n    So, `K'` is a convex set with orthogonal widths `w_{\\pi/4} \\ge 2\\sqrt{2}` and `w_{3\\pi/4} \\ge 2\\sqrt{2}`.\n    Now we can apply the area bound `Area(K') \\ge (1/2) w_{\\alpha} w_{\\beta}` for orthogonal directions `\\alpha, \\beta`.\n    `Area(K') \\ge (1/2) * w_{\\pi/4} * w_{3\\pi/4} \\ge (1/2) * (2\\sqrt{2}) * (2\\sqrt{2}) = (1/2) * 8 = 4`.\n    This gives a lower bound for the area of `K'`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Using the relation `Area(K) = (1/2) Area(K')`, we get:\n    `Area(K) \\ge (1/2) * 4 = 2`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   We found a convex domain, the square `|x|+|y| \\le 1`, which has an area of 2 and satisfies all the conditions.\n*   We proved that any convex domain satisfying the conditions must have an area of at least 2.\n*   Therefore, the minimal area is 2."
