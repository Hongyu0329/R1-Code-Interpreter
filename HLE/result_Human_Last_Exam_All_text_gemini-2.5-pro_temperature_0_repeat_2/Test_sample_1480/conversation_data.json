    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Calculate the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   **Fuzzy System Type:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS).\n    *   **Given Value 1 (Antecedent Firing Strength):** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This value represents the degree to which the input `x'` satisfies the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th fuzzy rule. It is also known as the firing strength.\n    *   **Given Value 2 (Consequent Membership):** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This value represents the membership degree of a specific output `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part) of the k-th rule.\n    *   **Operation:** A t-norm operation is specified for combining the values.\n\n2.  **Interpret the \"Rule Activation Level\":**\n    The term \"rule activation level\" can be ambiguous.\n    *   **Strict Definition:** It often refers solely to the firing strength of the antecedent, which is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   **Implied Calculation:** However, the question provides two numerical values and an operation (t-norm), which strongly suggests that the goal is to compute the result of the fuzzy implication step. This step determines the membership value of the output fuzzy set for that specific rule. We will proceed with this interpretation, as it uses all the information provided.\n\n3.  **Understand the Fuzzy Inference Process:**\n    In a fuzzy logic system, the inference engine combines the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function to produce an output fuzzy set for the rule. The formula for this operation at a specific point `y_j` is:\n    `μ_activated_consequent(y_j) = t-norm(antecedent_firing_strength, μ_consequent(y_j))`\n    Substituting the given values:\n    `Result = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    `Result = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n4.  **Select and Apply the T-norm:**\n    A t-norm (triangular norm) generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation. The question does not specify which t-norm to use. The most common t-norms are:\n    *   **Minimum:** `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   **Product:** `t(a, b) = a * b`\n    In the absence of a specific instruction, the **minimum** operator is the most standard and widely used t-norm in fuzzy systems (e.g., Mamdani systems). We will use the minimum t-norm for the calculation.\n    `Result = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Performing the minimum operation on the two given values:\n    `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n    Therefore, the resulting activation level for the consequent is 0.7.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of Terminology:** The main challenge is interpreting \"rule activation level\". As analyzed, the context of the question points towards calculating the result of the fuzzy implication, not just stating the given antecedent firing strength.\n2.  **Simplification of IT3 FS:** The problem uses scalar values (0.7, 0.9) for what would be complex higher-order fuzzy sets in a true IT3 FLS. This implies the problem is focused on the fundamental t-norm operation at a specific representative level, effectively reducing it to a type-1 fuzzy logic calculation.\n3.  **Choice of T-norm:** The result depends on the t-norm chosen. Using the product t-norm would yield `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. However, the minimum t-norm is the most common default assumption.\n4.  **Distinction of Components:** It is crucial to understand that `Phi_k(x′)` comes from the \"IF\" part of the rule, and `μG_k_j(y_j)` comes from the \"THEN\" part. The t-norm operation combines them to determine the output of that rule.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Antecedent Firing Strength (f):** 0.7\n*   **Consequent Membership (μ):** 0.9\n*   **Operation:** t-norm, assumed to be the minimum operator.\n*   **Calculation:** `min(f, μ) = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Final Result:** 0.7\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
