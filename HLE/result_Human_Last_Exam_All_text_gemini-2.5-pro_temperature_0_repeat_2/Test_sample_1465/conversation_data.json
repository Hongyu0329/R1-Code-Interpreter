    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil (i.e., whether it forms a dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions of the heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. The core positions are `a` and `d`, which are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. The flanking positions `e` and `g` are often charged or polar and contribute to stability and specificity through electrostatic interactions.\n\nWe will assume the sequences are written as a series of 4 heptad repeats (`abcdefg` x 4), which is a common convention for designed peptides.\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Heptad Assignment (`abcdefg`):**\n    *   `a` positions: E, E, E, E (Glutamate)\n    *   `d` positions: Q, K, W, Q (Glutamine, Lysine, Tryptophan, Glutamine)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   This sequence has a mixed polar/hydrophobic core. The `a` positions are all negatively charged (E), which will cause electrostatic repulsion between parallel helices. This repulsion disfavors low-order oligomers like dimers where the chains are closest.\n    *   The `d` positions are mostly polar (Q, K) but include a very bulky hydrophobic residue, Tryptophan (W). A bulky `W` in the core is difficult to accommodate in a dimer and strongly favors a trimer or tetramer.\n    *   However, let's compare this to Sequence 5, which is very similar. As we will see, Sequence 5 is a trimer due to the presence of Threonine (T) at the `e` position. The only difference here is Alanine (A) at the `e` position. Since T is known to promote trimer formation, its absence here suggests this sequence adopts a different, likely lower, oligomeric state. The most logical conclusion from this comparison is that this sequence forms a **dimer (2)**. The polar interactions between `E` at `a` and `Q/K` at `d` must form a specific network that stabilizes the dimer, overriding the steric effect of the single `W`.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Assignment (`abcdefg`):**\n    *   `a` positions: E, E, N, E (Glutamate, Asparagine)\n    *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The `d` positions are all Leucine (L), providing a strong, canonical hydrophobic core.\n    *   The key determinant is the Asparagine (N) at the third `a` position. An `N` residue at a core `a` or `d` position is a classic design feature that specifically stabilizes a **dimer (2)** by forming a precise hydrogen bond across the two-helix interface.\n    *   The surrounding charged `E` residues at the `a` positions would repel each other in a trimer, further favoring the dimeric state.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Assignment (`abcdefg`):**\n    *   `a` positions: E, E, E, E (Glutamate)\n    *   `d` positions: I, I, W, I (Isoleucine, Tryptophan)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The `a` positions are all negatively charged (E), creating strong electrostatic repulsion that disfavors lower-order oligomers.\n    *   The `d` positions are all large, bulky hydrophobic residues (Isoleucine and Tryptophan). Packing these residues requires a larger hydrophobic core than is available in a dimer or trimer.\n    *   The combination of electrostatic repulsion at the `a` positions and the need for a spacious core for the bulky `d` positions strongly indicates a higher-order oligomer. A **tetramer (4)** best satisfies these requirements.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 4**\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Heptad Assignment (`abcdefg`):**\n    *   `a` positions: E, E, E, E (Glutamate, negative charge)\n    *   `d` positions: K, K, W, K (Lysine, positive charge; Tryptophan, hydrophobic)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   If this sequence were to form a parallel coiled-coil, the core would have strong electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged `E` residues at the `a` positions and between the positively charged `K` residues at the `d` positions. This makes a parallel structure highly unstable.\n    *   However, if the helices align in an *antiparallel* fashion, the `a` position of one helix interacts with the `d` position of the adjacent helix. This would create highly favorable `E-K` salt bridges all along the core.\n    *   This type of specific, complementary charge pairing is a known design strategy to create stable, antiparallel **dimers (2)**. The single hydrophobic `W` also contributes to the stability of the interface.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Heptad Assignment (`abcdefg`):**\n    *   `a` positions: E, E, E, E (Glutamate)\n    *   `d` positions: Q, K, W, Q (Glutamine, Lysine, Tryptophan)\n    *   `e` positions: T, T, T, T (Threonine)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The core (`a` and `d` positions) is identical to Sequence 1 and contains a bulky `W` residue, suggesting an oligomeric state greater than a dimer.\n    *   The key feature here is the presence of Threonine (T) at all `e` positions. The hydroxyl group of Threonine is known to form stabilizing inter-helical hydrogen bonds that specifically promote the formation of **trimers (3)**.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 3**\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Sequence 1: Dimer (2)\n*   Sequence 2: Dimer (2)\n*   Sequence 3: Tetramer (4)\n*   Sequence 4: Dimer (2)\n*   Sequence 5: Trimer (3)\n\nThis corresponds to the list **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
