    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the basic properties of the function `f`\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** The function $g(x) = \\exp(x)$ is injective (one-to-one). We can show that this implies $f$ must also be injective.\n    *   Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    *   Using the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$.\n    *   Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n    *   Therefore, $f$ is an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** The problem states that $f$ is a continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. A continuous and injective function on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly decreasing\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n\n1.  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is because if $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ (since $f$ is decreasing), and applying $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$ (since $f$ is decreasing). The function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, so this is consistent.\n\n2.  Let's analyze the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $\\pm\\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to \\infty$. Let $y = f(x)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, as $x \\to \\infty$, $y$ must approach some limit $L \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{-\\infty\\}$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to L} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, it cannot have a vertical asymptote at a finite point $L$. Thus, the limit must be taken at infinity, which means $L = -\\infty$. So, we must have $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to 0$. Let $y = f(x)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, as $x \\to -\\infty$, $y$ must approach some limit $M \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to M} f(y) = 0$.\n        *   If $M = \\infty$, then $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = 0$. But we already established that $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$. This is a contradiction.\n        *   If $M = -\\infty$, then $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = 0$. However, from the analysis of the limit at $x \\to \\infty$, we found that $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = \\infty$. This is a contradiction ($0 = \\infty$).\n        *   Therefore, $M$ must be a finite real number. By the continuity of $f$, $\\lim_{y \\to M} f(y) = f(M)$. So, we must have $f(M) = 0$.\n\n3.  We have deduced that if a decreasing solution $f$ exists, it must satisfy $f(M)=0$ for some $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Let's use the original equation to find related values:\n    *   $f(f(M)) = \\exp(M) \\implies f(0) = \\exp(M)$.\n    *   $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) \\implies f(\\exp(M)) = 1$.\n\n4.  Now we look for a contradiction.\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly decreasing and $f(M)=0$, $f(x) > 0$ if and only if $x < M$.\n    *   From $f(0) = \\exp(M)$, we know $\\exp(M)$ is always positive. This means $f(0) > 0$. For this to be true, we must have $0 < M$.\n    *   From $f(\\exp(M)) = 1$, we know $1$ is positive. This means $f(\\exp(M)) > 0$. For this to be true, we must have $\\exp(M) < M$.\n    *   However, the inequality $\\exp(x) < x$ has no real solutions. In fact, $\\exp(x) \\ge x+1$, which means $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   The condition $\\exp(M) < M$ leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions satisfying the given equation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly increasing\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n\n1.  **Existence of Solutions:** We can construct solutions in this case. The general idea is to define the function on a small interval and then use the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ to extend it to the entire real line.\n    *   First, note that if a solution $f$ exists, it can have no fixed points, because if $f(a)=a$, then $f(f(a))=a$, which would mean $\\exp(a)=a$, an equation with no real solutions. Since $f$ is continuous, we must have either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. Since $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) > x$ (for most $x$, and always $\\exp(x) \\ge x+1$), the case $f(x) < x$ would imply $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$, a contradiction. Thus, any increasing solution must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Construction:**\n    *   Choose any real number $x_0$.\n    *   Choose any real number $y_0$ such that $x_0 < y_0 < \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   Define a function $\\phi$ on the interval $[x_0, y_0]$. We want this piece to be our function $f$. So we set $f(x_0) = y_0$. The equation $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$ then implies $f(y_0) = \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   Let's define $f$ on the interval $[x_0, y_0]$ to be any strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi: [x_0, y_0] \\to [y_0, \\exp(x_0)]$ such that $\\phi(x_0) = y_0$ and $\\phi(y_0) = \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   This initial piece of the function can be extended uniquely to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n        *   For any $x \\in [y_0, \\exp(x_0)]$, $x$ is in the range of $\\phi$. So $x = \\phi(t)$ for a unique $t \\in [x_0, y_0]$. We must define $f(x) = f(\\phi(t)) = f(f(t)) = \\exp(t) = \\exp(\\phi^{-1}(x))$.\n        *   This process can be iterated to define $f$ on a sequence of intervals that cover $[x_0, \\infty)$.\n        *   Similarly, the function can be extended backwards to cover $(-\\infty, x_0)$. For $y \\in [x_0, y_0]$, we define $f^{-1}(y) = \\ln(\\phi(y))$. This defines $f$ on the interval to the left of $[x_0, y_0]$.\n    *   This construction generates a valid, continuous, strictly increasing solution $f(x)$ for every valid choice of $x_0, y_0$, and $\\phi$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Cardinality\n\nThe number of solutions is the number of possible valid constructions.\n\n1.  The construction depends on the choice of $x_0$, $y_0$, and the function $\\phi$. Let's fix $x_0=0$ and $y_0=1/2$. The condition $x_0 < y_0 < \\exp(x_0)$ becomes $0 < 1/2 < \\exp(0)=1$, which is true.\n2.  We now need to count the number of strictly increasing continuous functions $\\phi: [0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]$.\n3.  Any such function can be created. For example, one can take the straight line $\\phi(x) = x + 1/2$. Another is $\\phi(x) = x^2 + 1/2$. More generally, one can take the base linear function and add a \"bump\". Let $L(x) = x+1/2$. Let $g(x)$ be any continuous function on $[0, 1/2]$ with $g(0)=g(1/2)=0$. Then for a sufficiently small constant $\\epsilon$, $\\phi(x) = L(x) + \\epsilon g(x)$ will be a valid choice.\n4.  The set of possible functions for $g(x)$ has the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ (or $c$). For example, for every real number $a \\in (0, 1/4)$, the function $g_a(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x/a)$ for $x \\in [0, a]$ and $g_a(x)=0$ otherwise, leads to a different function $\\phi$.\n5.  This shows that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions $\\phi$. Therefore, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions to the original equation.\n6.  The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense set, such as the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n7.  The set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, so its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n8.  Since the cardinality is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum ($\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$)>>>"
