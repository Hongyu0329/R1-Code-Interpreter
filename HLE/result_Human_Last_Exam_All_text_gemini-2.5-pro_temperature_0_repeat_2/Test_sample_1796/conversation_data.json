    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the sentence and the target word.**\nThe sentence provided is: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\nThe question asks for the part of speech of the first word, which is \"Fat\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the function of the word \"Fat\" within the sentence.**\nIn the sentence, the word \"Fat\" is placed directly before the word \"people\". The word \"people\" is a noun (it names a group of persons). The word \"Fat\" is used here to describe or modify the noun \"people\". It answers the question \"What kind of people?\".\n\n**Step 3: Define the relevant parts of speech.**\n*   **Noun:** A word that names a person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., *dog, city, happiness*).\n*   **Verb:** A word that expresses an action or a state of being (e.g., *run, is, think*).\n*   **Adjective:** A word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun (e.g., *happy, red, tall*).\n*   **Adverb:** A word that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb (e.g., *quickly, very, well*).\n*   **Conjunction:** A word that connects words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., *and, but, or*).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the correct part of speech for \"Fat\" in this context.**\nSince \"Fat\" is describing the noun \"people\", its grammatical function is that of an adjective.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The word \"fat\" can also be a noun (e.g., \"You should avoid eating too much *fat*.\"). However, in the given sentence, it is not used as a noun because it is modifying \"people\".\n*   The overall sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is grammatically incorrect. A correct sentence might be \"The fat that people eat accumulates\" (where \"fat\" would be a noun) or \"Fat people accumulate fat\" (where the first \"Fat\" is an adjective).\n*   Despite the grammatical error in the complete sentence, the part of speech of a word is determined by its function in its immediate phrase. In the phrase \"Fat people\", \"Fat\" clearly functions as an adjective modifying \"people\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" is modifying the noun \"people\". Therefore, it is an adjective. This corresponds to answer choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
