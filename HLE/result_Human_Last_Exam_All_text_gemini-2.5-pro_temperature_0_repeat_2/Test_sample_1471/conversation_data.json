    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Equation and Order of Operations**\nThe equation provided is `XXIV / CCC - CCCLXXXI = ?`.\nThis involves Roman numerals and two arithmetic operations: division (/) and subtraction (-).\nAccording to the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. So, the calculation will be `(XXIV / CCC) - CCCLXXXI`.\n\n**Step 2: Convert Roman Numerals to Modern (Arabic) Numbers**\nWe need to convert each Roman numeral into its modern equivalent.\n\n*   **XXIV:**\n    *   `X` represents 10. `XX` is 10 + 10 = 20.\n    *   `IV` represents 4 (since `I` comes before `V`, it's 5 - 1).\n    *   Therefore, `XXIV` = 20 + 4 = **24**.\n\n*   **CCC:**\n    *   `C` represents 100.\n    *   Therefore, `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**.\n\n*   **CCCLXXXI:**\n    *   `CCC` represents 300.\n    *   `L` represents 50. `X` represents 10. `LXXX` is 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80.\n    *   `I` represents 1.\n    *   Therefore, `CCCLXXXI` = 300 + 80 + 1 = **381**.\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the Modern Numbers into the Equation**\nNow, we replace the Roman numerals in the original equation with their modern number equivalents:\n`24 / 300 - 381 = ?`\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\nFollowing the order of operations, we first perform the division and then the subtraction.\n\n*   **Part A: Division**\n    *   Calculate `24 / 300`.\n    *   `24 ÷ 300 = 0.08`\n\n*   **Part B: Subtraction**\n    *   Now, use the result from the division and perform the subtraction.\n    *   `0.08 - 381`\n    *   `0.08 - 381 = -380.92`\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Roman Numeral Conversion:** Ensure accuracy in converting Roman numerals, especially with subtractive notation (like IV, IX, XL, etc.).\n*   **Order of Operations:** Always perform division and multiplication before addition and subtraction. In this case, `24 / 300` is calculated first.\n*   **Arithmetic:** Be careful with the decimal calculation and the subtraction involving a negative number.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n1.  The equation is `(XXIV / CCC) - CCCLXXXI`.\n2.  Converting to modern numbers gives `(24 / 300) - 381`.\n3.  Calculating the division gives `0.08 - 381`.\n4.  Calculating the subtraction gives `-380.92`.\n\n<<<-380.92>>>"
