    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$)**: This is a group whose elements are oriented homology 3-spheres. A homology 3-sphere is a 3-manifold $Y$ with the same integer homology groups as the 3-sphere $S^3$ (i.e., $H_0(Y)=\\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(Y)=0$, $H_2(Y)=0$, $H_3(Y)=\\mathbb{Z}$). Two homology spheres $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ represent the same element in this group if they are homology cobordant, meaning there exists a 4-manifold $W$ whose boundary is $Y_1 \\sqcup -Y_2$ (where $-Y_2$ is $Y_2$ with the opposite orientation) and $W$ has the same homology as a cylinder ($Y_1 \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is the connected sum ($\\#$). The identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure to construct a 3-manifold from a knot $K$ in $S^3$. We remove a tubular neighborhood of the knot and glue a solid torus back in a specific way. \"Integral surgery\" means the surgery coefficient is an integer, $n$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_n(K)$.\n*   **Condition for a Homology Sphere**: The first homology group of the surgered manifold is $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. For this to be a homology sphere, we need $H_1=0$, which requires $|n|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider surgeries with coefficients $+1$ and $-1$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Knots\n\nWe need to consider all knots with four or fewer crossings. Using standard knot tables:\n1.  **0 crossings**: The unknot, $0_1$.\n2.  **1, 2 crossings**: No knots.\n3.  **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot, $3_1$. It is chiral, so we must consider both the right-handed trefoil (let's call it $3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (its mirror image, $-3_1$).\n4.  **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Surgery on Each Knot\n\nFor each knot, we perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery and identify the resulting homology sphere and its class in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n*   **Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ is also the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   **Element generated**: $[S^3]$, the identity element of $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n*   **Trefoil Knots ($3_1$ and $-3_1$)**:\n    *   Let $P$ denote the Poincaré homology sphere, a well-known homology sphere that is not $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: This surgery on the right-handed trefoil yields $P$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: Using the identity $S^3_{-n}(K) = -S^3_n(-K)$, we have $S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$. Surgery on the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$) gives the oppositely oriented Poincaré sphere, $-P$. So, $S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -(-P) = P$.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$: This gives $-P$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$: This gives $-S^3_{+1}(-(-3_1)) = -S^3_{+1}(3_1) = -P$.\n    *   **Elements generated**: The trefoil knots generate two distinct homology spheres, $P$ and $-P$, which correspond to the elements $[P]$ and $[-P]$ in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   Let $Y_4 = S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. This is a hyperbolic homology sphere (the Weeks-Matveev-Fomenko manifold).\n    *   Since $4_1$ is amphichiral (i.e., $4_1 = -4_1$), we have $S^3_{-1}(4_1) = -S^3_{+1}(-4_1) = -S^3_{+1}(4_1) = -Y_4$.\n    *   **Elements generated**: The figure-eight knot generates two homology spheres, $Y_4$ and $-Y_4$, corresponding to elements $[Y_4]$ and $[-Y_4]$.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Distinct Elements in $\\Theta_3^H$\n\nSo far, we have generated a set of candidate elements: $\\{[S^3], [P], [-P], [Y_4], [-Y_4]\\}$. We must determine which of these are the same in the homology cobordism group.\n\n1.  $[S^3]$ is the identity and is distinct from the others. For example, its Rohlin invariant is 0, while the others have Rohlin invariant 1.\n2.  $[P]$ and $[-P]$ are distinct and are inverses. If $[P] = [-P]$, then $2[P]=0$. However, the Casson invariant $\\lambda$ is a homomorphism to $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\lambda(P)=1$. So $\\lambda(P\\#P) = \\lambda(P)+\\lambda(P) = 2 \\neq 0$, meaning $P\\#P$ is not homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n3.  The crucial question is the relationship between $[P]$ and $[Y_4]$. Both have Rohlin invariant 1 and Casson invariant 1, so these invariants cannot distinguish them.\n4.  A significant result in 4-manifold topology, due to Akbulut and Kirby, shows that there exists a contractible 4-manifold whose boundary is $P \\# -Y_4$. The existence of such a manifold implies that $P$ and $Y_4$ are homology cobordant.\n5.  Therefore, in $\\Theta_3^H$, we have the equality $[P] = [Y_4]$.\n6.  Taking inverses, we also have $[-P] = [-Y_4]$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nCombining all the results, the set of all distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by these surgeries is:\n1.  **$[S^3]$** (from the unknot)\n2.  **$[P]$** (from both the trefoil and the figure-eight knot)\n3.  **$[-P]$** (from both the trefoil and the figure-eight knot)\n\nThese three elements are distinct from each other. Therefore, there are a total of 3 such elements.\n\n<<<3>>>"
