    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final binary pattern.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Cellular Automaton:** This is a system of cells on a grid that evolves in discrete time steps. In this case, it's a 1-dimensional grid (a line of cells).\n*   **States:** Each cell can be in one of two states: 0 (off/white) or 1 (on/black).\n*   **Neighborhood:** The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its own current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. This forms a 3-cell neighborhood.\n*   **Rule 110:** This specific rule defines the output for each of the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns. The number 110 in binary is `01101110`. This binary string is a lookup table for the neighborhoods, ordered from `111` down to `000`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Rule 110 Lookup Table\n\nWe map the 8 possible neighborhoods to their next state based on the binary string `01101110`.\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | Binary Value | Output from Rule `01101110` |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `111` | 7 | **0** |\n| `110` | 6 | **1** |\n| `101` | 5 | **1** |\n| `100` | 4 | **0** |\n| `011` | 3 | **1** |\n| `010` | 2 | **1** |\n| `001` | 1 | **1** |\n| `000` | 0 | **0** |\n\n### Step 3: List Careful Points for Simulation\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The simulation starts at Generation 0 with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by an infinite number of cells in state 0. `...0001000...`\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** When calculating the next state for a cell at the edge of the pattern, any neighbor that falls outside the pattern is considered to be in state 0. For example, to calculate the next state for the leftmost '1' in the pattern `...00110...`, its neighborhood is `(0, 1, 1)`.\n3.  **Iteration Count:** The question asks for the pattern after applying the rule 20 times. This means we need to calculate the state for Generation 1, Generation 2, ..., up to Generation 20.\n4.  **Accuracy:** The calculation for each generation must be precise. A single error in one generation will propagate and lead to an incorrect final result.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Analysis of Generations\n\nWe will now apply the Rule 110 lookup table for 20 generations, starting from a single '1'. For clarity, we only show the binary pattern between the first and last '1'.\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n*   **Gen 1:** Apply rule to `...00100...` -> `110`\n*   **Gen 2:** Apply rule to `...01100...` -> `1110`\n*   **Gen 3:** Apply rule to `...01110...` -> `11010`\n*   **Gen 4:** Apply rule to `...011010...` -> `111110`\n*   **Gen 5:** Apply rule to `...0111110...` -> `1100010`\n*   **Gen 6:** Apply rule to `...01100010...` -> `11100110`\n*   **Gen 7:** Apply rule to `...011100110...` -> `110101110`\n*   **Gen 8:** Apply rule to `...0110101110...` -> `1111111010`\n*   **Gen 9:** Apply rule to `...01111111010...` -> `11000001110`\n*   **Gen 10:** Apply rule to `...011000001110...` -> `11100011010`\n*   **Gen 11:** Apply rule to `...011100011010...` -> `110100111110`\n*   **Gen 12:** Apply rule to `...0110100111110...` -> `1111101100010`\n*   **Gen 13:** Apply rule to `...01111101100010...` -> `11000111100110`\n*   **Gen 14:** Apply rule to `...011000111100110...` -> `111001100101110`\n*   **Gen 15:** Apply rule to `...0111001100101110...` -> `1101011101111010`\n*   **Gen 16:** Apply rule to `...01101011101111010...` -> `11111110111001110`\n*   **Gen 17:** Apply rule to `...011111110111001110...` -> `110000011101011010`\n*   **Gen 18:** Apply rule to `...0110000011101011010...` -> `111000110111111110`\n*   **Gen 19:** Apply rule to `...0111000110111111110...` -> `1101001111100000010`\n*   **Gen 20:** Apply rule to `...01101001111100000010...` -> `1111101100010000110`\n\nThe final pattern after 20 applications of the rule is the state at Generation 20.\n\n<<<1111101100010000110>>>"
