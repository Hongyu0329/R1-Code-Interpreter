    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific philosopher who meets three criteria:\n1.  They belong to the **Lviv-Warsaw School** of philosophy.\n2.  They analyzed the concept of a **\"hallmark\"** (or a similar term like sign, mark, or criterion).\n3.  They decomposed this concept into two distinct types: **\"symptoms\"** and **\"signals\"**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Concepts**\n*   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy active in the interwar period (c. 1915-1939). Its members were known for their emphasis on logical rigor, clarity of language, and opposition to irrationalism. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n*   **Hallmark / Symptom / Signal Distinction:** This is a distinction within semiotics (the theory of signs) or epistemology (the theory of knowledge).\n    *   A **symptom** is generally understood as a *natural sign*. It has a causal or natural connection to the thing it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. The connection exists independently of any human convention.\n    *   A **signal** is generally understood as a *conventional sign*. Its meaning is established by a rule, agreement, or intention. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"dog\" is a signal for the concept of a dog. The connection is artificial, not natural.\n    *   **Hallmark** (or mark, sign, criterion) is the broader category that encompasses both types of indicators.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nWe need to find which philosopher from this school is known for this specific semiotic/epistemological distinction.\n*   **Kazimierz Twardowski:** Focused on the distinction between the content and object of a presentation. His work was foundational but doesn't specifically feature the symptom/signal dichotomy.\n*   **Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski:** These figures were primarily logicians who worked on formal systems (many-valued logic, mereology, model theory, theory of truth). While their work relates to meaning in formal languages, the natural/conventional sign distinction was not their central focus.\n*   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński:** Known for reism (or concretism) and praxiology (the theory of efficient action). His work was more metaphysical and practical.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz:** This is the most promising candidate. Ajdukiewicz worked extensively on epistemology, philosophy of language, and what he called \"pragmatic logic.\" He was deeply concerned with the structure of language, meaning, and the ways we justify our beliefs through inference. His analysis of inference required a careful analysis of the nature of signs used as premises.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Attribution to Ajdukiewicz**\nIn his works, particularly in his influential book *Pragmatic Logic* (originally published in Polish in 1965, based on earlier lectures), Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz explicitly analyzes the concept of a sign or mark (*oznaka* in Polish). He makes a fundamental distinction between:\n1.  **Symptoms (*symptomy*):** Natural signs that are causally linked to what they indicate.\n2.  **Signals (*sygnały*):** Signs created by convention or for the purpose of communication.\n\nThis distinction was crucial for his analysis of different types of reasoning and how we derive conclusions from evidence, where the evidence can be either a natural symptom or a conventional signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of a hallmark (or sign) into symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
