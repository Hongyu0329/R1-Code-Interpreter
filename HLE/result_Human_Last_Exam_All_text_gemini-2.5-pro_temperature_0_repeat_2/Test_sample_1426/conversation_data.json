    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The question requires us to find the lowest note among the final three notes played by the first violin section in Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n\n2.  **Locate the Score:** To answer this, we must refer to the musical score of the symphony. We need to look at the very end of the fourth and final movement, which is marked \"Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n3.  **Isolate the First Violin Part:** Within the score, we need to find the staff labeled \"Violino I\" (First Violin). This part is typically located at the top of the string section.\n\n4.  **Examine the Final Measures:** Looking at the last few measures of the first violin part in a standard edition of the score, we find the following sequence of notes leading to the final chord:\n    *   In the third-to-last measure of music for the violins, they play two notes: a half note **A**, followed by a half note **B-flat**.\n    *   In the penultimate (second-to-last) measure, they play a single whole note: **B-flat**.\n    *   In the final measure, they play a single whole note held with a fermata: **B-flat**.\n\n5.  **Interpret \"the last three notes\":** The question asks for the lowest of the \"last three notes\". This refers to the final melodic statement made by the first violins. Counting backward from the very end, the last three notes played are:\n    *   Note 3 (last): **B-flat**\n    *   Note 2 (second to last): **B-flat**\n    *   Note 1 (third to last): **A**\n\n6.  **Compare the Pitches:** The set of the last three notes is {A, B-flat, B-flat}. We need to identify the lowest pitch among these. Comparing the note A to the note B-flat, A is a semitone lower.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Correct Work:** It is crucial to analyze Symphony No. 2, Op. 4, not any of Dvořák's other eight symphonies.\n*   **Correct Instrument:** The question is specifically about the first violin part, not the entire orchestra's final chord or any other instrument's part.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Ends on\":** This phrase points to the concluding musical gesture. The resolution from the leading tone (A) to the tonic (B-flat) is the essential part of this conclusion. Therefore, including the A is musically correct. A more literal, but less likely, interpretation would be to count the last three identical B-flat notes, which would make the question trivial. The most logical interpretation includes the note that resolves to the final tonic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the score, the last three notes played by the first violin are A, B-flat, and B-flat. The lowest of these three notes is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
