    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement\n\nFirst, let's understand the terms used in the question.\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a well-known example.\n*   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** This is the space $X$ with a single point $x$ removed. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, $\\{x\\}$ is a closed set, making $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ an open subset of $X$. As $X$ is a continuum, $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected and locally compact, but not compact.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** For a Tychonoff space $Y$ (which $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is), its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** This is the set $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. We will denote it by $R$.\n*   **Composant:** In a continuum $C$, the composant of a point $p \\in C$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $C$ that contain $p$. Composants partition the continuum. A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant (the space itself). A non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of the remainder $R$\n\n1.  **Is $R$ a continuum?**\n    The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a connected, locally compact space. A standard theorem in topology states that the Stone-Cech remainder of a connected, locally compact space is connected. Since the remainder is also a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta Y$, it is compact. Therefore, $R$ is a compact and connected space. Since $Y$ is a metric space, $\\beta Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space. Thus, $R$ is a continuum. This means the concept of composants is applicable to $R$.\n\n2.  **Is $R$ indecomposable?**\n    This is the crucial part of the analysis. There is a deep theorem in continuum theory by J. Krasinkiewicz and P. Minc (1977) which states:\n    *   **Theorem:** If $X$ is an indecomposable continuum and $x \\in X$, then the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    The problem states that $X$ is a *hereditary* indecomposable continuum. This is a stronger condition than being merely indecomposable, so the theorem applies directly. Therefore, the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n3.  **Is $R$ a non-degenerate continuum?**\n    A continuum is non-degenerate if it consists of more than one point. The remainder $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ is a single point if and only if $Y$ is a locally compact and pseudocompact space.\n    *   A metric space is pseudocompact if and only if it is compact.\n    *   The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a metric space.\n    *   Is $Y$ compact? No. As a proper, non-empty, open subset of a connected space $X$, $Y$ cannot be closed, and thus cannot be compact.\n    *   Since $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not compact, it is not pseudocompact.\n    *   Therefore, the remainder $R$ is not a single point. It is a non-degenerate continuum.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of composants\n\nWe have established that for any hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a non-degenerate, indecomposable continuum.\n\nNow, we use another classic result from continuum theory:\n*   **Theorem (Mazurkiewicz):** Any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, also denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$) composants.\n\nEach composant is a dense $F_{\\sigma}$ subset, and they are all pairwise disjoint.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the final answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is always $2^{\\aleph_0}$, regardless of the specific choice of the hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$ or the point $x \\in X$.\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants. Since the number of composants is constant for all spaces satisfying the given conditions, the maximum number is this constant value.\n\nThe maximum possible number of composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
