    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the upper bound.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Context:** The question relates concepts from the geometry of numbers to algebraic number theory. We are considering lattices derived from real quadratic number fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is a squarefree natural number.\n\n2.  **Define the Lattice and its Covolume (V):**\n    *   The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ is embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to form a lattice $\\Lambda$. The standard embedding for an element $x \\in K$ is $\\sigma(x) = (\\sigma_1(x), \\sigma_2(x))$, where $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are the two distinct embeddings of $K$ into the real numbers. For $x = a+b\\sqrt{N}$, this is $(a+b\\sqrt{N}, a-b\\sqrt{N})$.\n    *   The covolume $V$ of this lattice $\\Lambda$ is the volume of its fundamental parallelotope, which is equal to the square root of the absolute value of the discriminant of the field, $V = \\sqrt{|d_K|}$.\n    *   The structure of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ and its discriminant $d_K$ depend on $N$ modulo 4:\n        *   **Case A: $N \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod{4}$**. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{N}]$. The discriminant is $d_K = 4N$. The covolume is $V = \\sqrt{4N} = 2\\sqrt{N}$.\n        *   **Case B: $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$**. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}]$. The discriminant is $d_K = N$. The covolume is $V = \\sqrt{N}$.\n\n3.  **Define the Maximum Norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$):**\n    *   The norm used is the maximum norm (or infinity norm) on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, defined as $\\|(x,y)\\|_\\infty = \\max(|x|, |y|)$.\n    *   The term $k_{k,\\infty}$ represents the maximum of the infinity norms of the vectors in a standard, reduced basis of the lattice $\\Lambda$. For the lattices we are considering, a natural choice of basis for $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\\{1, \\omega\\}$, where $\\omega = \\sqrt{N}$ or $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}$. The image of this basis under the embedding $\\sigma$, i.e., $\\{\\sigma(1), \\sigma(\\omega)\\}$, forms a basis for the lattice $\\Lambda$ that is Minkowski-reduced with respect to the infinity norm.\n    *   Therefore, $k_{k,\\infty} = \\max(\\|\\sigma(1)\\|_\\infty, \\|\\sigma(\\omega)\\|_\\infty)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Norm for Each Case:**\n    *   The first basis vector is always $\\sigma(1) = (1,1)$, and its norm is $\\|\\sigma(1)\\|_\\infty = 1$.\n    *   **Case A ($N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$):**\n        *   The second basis element is $\\omega = \\sqrt{N}$. Its image is $\\sigma(\\sqrt{N}) = (\\sqrt{N}, -\\sqrt{N})$.\n        *   The norm is $\\|\\sigma(\\sqrt{N})\\|_\\infty = \\max(|\\sqrt{N}|, |-\\sqrt{N}|) = \\sqrt{N}$.\n        *   Since $N \\ge 2$, $\\sqrt{N} > 1$. Thus, the maximum norm is $k_{k,\\infty} = \\sqrt{N}$.\n        *   Relating this to the covolume $V = 2\\sqrt{N}$, we find $k_{k,\\infty} = V/2$.\n\n    *   **Case B ($N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$):**\n        *   The second basis element is $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}$. Its image is $\\sigma(\\omega) = (\\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}, \\frac{1-\\sqrt{N}}{2})$.\n        *   The norm is $\\|\\sigma(\\omega)\\|_\\infty = \\max\\left(\\left|\\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}\\right|, \\left|\\frac{1-\\sqrt{N}}{2}\\right|\\right) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}$ (since $N \\ge 5$, so $\\sqrt{N}>1$).\n        *   Since $N \\ge 5$, $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2} > 1$. Thus, the maximum norm is $k_{k,\\infty} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{N}}{2}$.\n        *   Relating this to the covolume $V = \\sqrt{N}$, we find $k_{k,\\infty} = \\frac{1+V}{2}$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Overall Upper Bound:**\n    *   We have established two possible exact relationships between the maximum norm and the covolume, depending on the type of squarefree number $N$:\n        1.  $k_{k,\\infty} = V/2$\n        2.  $k_{k,\\infty} = (V+1)/2$\n    *   The question asks for a single upper bound that holds for all cases. This bound, let's call it $f(V)$, must satisfy $k_{k,\\infty} \\le f(V)$ for any lattice arising from a squarefree $N$.\n    *   This means we need $f(V) \\ge V/2$ and $f(V) \\ge (V+1)/2$.\n    *   Comparing the two expressions, we see that for any positive $V$, $(V+1)/2 = V/2 + 1/2 > V/2$.\n    *   Therefore, the condition $f(V) \\ge (V+1)/2$ is the more restrictive one. To find the tightest possible upper bound, we should choose the maximum of the two possible values.\n    *   The upper bound is thus given by the larger expression.\n\nThe final upper bound is the expression that is valid in all cases.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is given by the inequality:\n$k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\frac{V+1}{2}$\n\nThis inequality holds for all lattices constructed from the rings of integers of real quadratic fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ where $N$ is a squarefree natural number.\n\n<<<(V+1)/2>>>"
