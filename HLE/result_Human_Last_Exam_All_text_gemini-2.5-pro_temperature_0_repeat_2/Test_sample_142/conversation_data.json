    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)\nFirst, we sum the number of electrons for each atom in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron each (x3) = 3 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons, N = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K)\nNext, we determine the number of atomic orbitals (basis functions) provided by the 6-31G** basis set for each atom.\n\n*   **6-31G**: This is a split-valence basis set. Core electrons are described by a single contracted function (from 6 primitives). Valence electrons are described by two functions (an inner contracted function from 3 primitives and an outer single primitive).\n*   **\\*\\***: These are polarization functions. The first `*` adds one set of d-functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. The second `*` adds one set of p-functions to hydrogen atoms. A set of d-functions has 5 orbitals, and a set of p-functions has 3 orbitals.\n\nLet's count the basis functions for each atom:\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   The 1s orbital is valence. The 6-31G part gives 2 basis functions (1s', 1s'').\n    *   The `**` part adds a set of p-functions (px, py, pz), which is 3 functions.\n    *   Total for one H atom = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n    *   For three H atoms: 3 * 5 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C)** (a second-row heavy atom):\n    *   Core (1s): 1 basis function.\n    *   Valence (2s, 2p): The 2s orbital is split into 2 functions. The 2p orbitals (px, py, pz) are also split, giving 2 * 3 = 6 functions. Total valence = 2 + 6 = 8 functions.\n    *   The `*` part adds a set of d-functions, which is 5 functions.\n    *   Total for C atom = 1 (core) + 8 (valence) + 5 (polarization) = 14 basis functions.\n\n*   **Fluorine (F)** (a second-row heavy atom):\n    *   The count is the same as for Carbon.\n    *   Total for F atom = 14 basis functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si)** (a third-row heavy atom):\n    *   Core (1s, 2s, 2p): 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n    *   Valence (3s, 3p): The 3s is split into 2 functions. The 3p orbitals are split into 2 * 3 = 6 functions. Total valence = 2 + 6 = 8 functions.\n    *   The `*` part adds a set of d-functions, which is 5 functions.\n    *   Total for Si atom = 5 (core) + 8 (valence) + 5 (polarization) = 18 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms to get the total number of orbitals, K:\nK = (functions for C) + 3 * (functions for H) + (functions for Si) + (functions for F)\nK = 14 + 15 + 18 + 14 = 61.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the total spin (S)\nThe molecule has an even number of electrons (N=32). For a stable, closed-shell molecule, the ground state is a singlet state, which means the total spin S = 0.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of CSFs\nThe number of CSFs for a system with K orbitals, N electrons, and total spin S is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula. There are two common equivalent forms. We will use the genealogical construction formula, which is expressed as a difference of products of binomial coefficients:\n\nNumber of CSFs = $\\binom{K}{N/2 - S}\\binom{K}{N/2 + S} - \\binom{K}{N/2 - S - 1}\\binom{K}{N/2 + S + 1}$\n\nPlugging in our values: K = 61, N = 32, S = 0.\n*   N/2 = 16\n*   N/2 - S = 16\n*   N/2 + S = 16\n*   N/2 - S - 1 = 15\n*   N/2 + S + 1 = 17\n\nThe formula becomes:\nNumber of CSFs = $\\binom{61}{16}\\binom{61}{16} - \\binom{61}{15}\\binom{61}{17}$\nNumber of CSFs = $\\left(\\binom{61}{16}\\right)^2 - \\binom{61}{15}\\binom{61}{17}$\n\nNow we calculate the values of the binomial coefficients. These calculations require a tool capable of handling very large integers.\n*   $\\binom{61}{15} = \\frac{61!}{15!46!} = 44,349,611,722,480$\n*   $\\binom{61}{16} = \\frac{61!}{16!45!} = 181,758,408,050,100$\n*   $\\binom{61}{17} = \\frac{61!}{17!44!} = 635,439,678,176,800$\n\nNow substitute these values back into the formula:\n*   Term 1: $\\left(\\binom{61}{16}\\right)^2 = (181,758,408,050,100)^2 = 33,036,121,180,958,988,010,000,000,000$\n*   Term 2: $\\binom{61}{15}\\binom{61}{17} = (44,349,611,722,480) \\times (635,439,678,176,800) = 28,181,374,519,958,988,008,000,000,000$\n\nFinally, we perform the subtraction:\nNumber of CSFs = $33,036,121,180,958,988,010,000,000,000 - 28,181,374,519,958,988,008,000,000,000$\nNumber of CSFs = $4,854,746,661,000,000,002,000,000,000$\n\n<<<4854746661000000002000000000>>>"
