The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a single number but a set of defining rules. For a single Grassmann variable $\eta$, the Berezin integral is defined by the following two properties:
1.  $\int d\eta \, 1 = 0$
2.  $\int d\eta \, \eta = 1$
These rules, combined with the nilpotency of the Grassmann variables ($\eta^2 = 0$), ensure that the path integral correctly incorporates the Pauli exclusion principle.
