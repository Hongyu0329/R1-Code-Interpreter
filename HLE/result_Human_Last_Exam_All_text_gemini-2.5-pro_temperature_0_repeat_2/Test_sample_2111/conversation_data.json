    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Figures and Concepts:** The question involves historian Fernand Braudel, writer Paul Morand, and a \"conceptual entity\" that should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\" This entity is linked to the \"symbol of a nation.\"\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The assertion comes from Fernand Braudel's work, specifically the third volume of his *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*, titled *The Perspective of the World*. In the introduction, Braudel sets up his argument for a global historical view.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Quote:** Braudel quotes Paul Morand to support his perspective. The direct quote from Morand (originally from the preface to his 1929 book *Histoires de l'Univers*) is: \"**A history of the world** should be inscribed within a sphere, like the globe of the geographer.\"\n\n4.  **Analyze the Quote to Find the Entity:** The subject of Morand's sentence is \"A history of the world.\" This is the conceptual entity that he argues should be visualized as being inscribed within a sphere. The sphere represents the globe, emphasizing a complete, all-encompassing view.\n\n5.  **Connect the Entity to the \"Symbol of a Nation\":** The question states that this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This is a slight misreading of Braudel's point. Braudel's argument is that the history of a single nation is *insufficient* on its own. He uses Morand's quote to argue that the history of a nation must be placed *within* the larger context of world history (the sphere) to be properly understood. Therefore, the history of a nation is a *component* of the entity, not an example of the entity itself. The entity is the overarching framework that contains all national histories.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the direct quote from Morand, which Braudel uses to frame his own argument, the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within a sphere is \"a history of the world.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe conceptual entity is **a history of the world**.\n\n<<<a history of the world>>>"
