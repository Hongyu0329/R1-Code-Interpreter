    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian based on several key criteria:\n1.  **Who:** A Christian theologian.\n2.  **What:** He was the *first* to develop *specialized terminology*.\n3.  **Purpose:** The terminology is used to describe or explain *changes in the laws of nature*.\n4.  **Application:** This terminology is applicable to two specific theological concepts:\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus.\n    *   The possible alterations in the natural world that occurred at the Fall of Man.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nBased on the history of Christian theology and its interaction with philosophy and the natural world, a few major figures come to mind who dealt with the concepts of miracles, creation, and natural order.\n*   **Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130–202 AD):** An early Church Father who wrote about creation and Christ's role in \"recapitulating\" or summing up humanity. While he affirmed miracles, he is not known for creating a specific philosophical terminology for how they interact with natural laws.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** A foundational theologian for Western Christianity. He wrote extensively on creation, God's providence, and miracles. He engaged deeply with Neoplatonic philosophy and developed his own unique theological concepts.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 AD):** The foremost theologian of the Scholastic period. He synthesized Christian doctrine with Aristotelian philosophy and created a highly systematic theology. He also wrote in detail about God's power, nature, and miracles.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Candidates Against the Criteria**\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** Aquinas developed the important distinction between God's **ordained power** (*potentia ordinata*) and His **absolute power** (*potentia absoluta*). The \"ordained power\" refers to God's upholding of the regular laws of nature He established. The \"absolute power\" refers to God's ability to do anything that is not logically contradictory, including miracles that go beyond the ordained laws. This terminology certainly fits the description of explaining \"changes in the laws of nature\" and can be applied to the virgin birth. However, the question asks for the theologian who was the *first* to do this.\n\n*   **Augustine of Hippo:** Augustine lived over 800 years before Aquinas. In his efforts to explain how God could perform miracles without being arbitrary or violating His own perfect creation, Augustine developed the concept of ***rationes seminales***, which can be translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles.\"\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** The term *rationes seminales* is highly specialized. Augustine proposed that at the moment of creation, God embedded these latent, causal principles for *everything* that would ever come to be into the fabric of the world.\n    *   **Explaining \"Changes\":** According to this view, the \"laws of nature\" are simply the normal, customary unfolding of these seminal reasons. A miracle, therefore, is not a violation of nature or a change in its laws. Instead, it is the activation by God of a *ratio seminalis* that was present from the beginning but lies outside the usual, everyday sequence of events.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, the virgin birth was not God breaking a rule of biology. It was the divinely-timed actualization of a unique seminal reason for a human to be born of a virgin, a potential that God had woven into creation from the very start.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** Similarly, the changes in the world after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of human mortality, pain in childbirth, the ground yielding thorns and thistles) can be understood within this framework. These were not ad-hoc punishments but the activation of latent causal principles for decay and hardship, contingent upon humanity's sin. The potential for this corrupted state was present from the beginning, to be triggered by disobedience.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nWhile Thomas Aquinas developed a very influential terminology, Augustine of Hippo did so centuries earlier. Augustine's concept of *rationes seminales* was the first systematic, specialized terminology developed by a major Christian theologian to provide a coherent explanation for events like the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall, which appear to be alterations to the normal course of nature. He provides a unified framework where these events are not violations of nature, but fulfillments of a deeper, divinely-authored potential within nature itself. Therefore, Augustine is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
