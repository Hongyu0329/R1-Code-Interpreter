    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:** First, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. This is the health it has when there is only one player in the world.\n    *   In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has 2,800 health.\n    *   In Expert Mode, all boss health values are increased. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the health is **3,640**.\n\n2.  **Understand the Health Scaling Formula:** In Terraria, boss health increases in multiplayer to provide a greater challenge. The formula for this scaling depends on the game mode. For Expert Mode, the source code specifies a clear, linear scaling rule.\n    *   The health is increased by a set percentage for each player in the game beyond the first one.\n    *   According to the game's code, the health boost per additional player in Expert Mode is **35%**.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Health Equation:** We can now create a mathematical formula to represent the Eye of Cthulhu's health (`H`) as a function of the number of players (`N`).\n    *   The total health is the base health plus the additional health from the extra players.\n    *   Additional health = `Base Health * 0.35 * (N - 1)`\n    *   So, the full formula is: `H(N) = 3640 + (3640 * 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n    *   This can be simplified to: `H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Formula for an Infinite Number of Players:** The question asks for the *theoretical maximum* health given an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to evaluate the limit of our health function `H(N)` as `N` approaches infinity (`N → ∞`).\n    *   Let's expand the formula:\n        `H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n        `H(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n        `H(N) = 2366 + 1274N`\n    *   This equation, `H(N) = 1274N + 2366`, is a linear function. The health increases by 1,274 for every single player added.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Limit:** Now we take the limit of this linear function as `N` approaches infinity:\n    *   `lim (N→∞) (1274N + 2366)`\n    *   As the number of players (`N`) increases without bound, the term `1274N` also increases without bound. The constant `2366` becomes insignificant.\n    *   Therefore, the limit of the function is infinity.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Theoretical vs. Practical:** The question asks for the *theoretical* maximum. In practice, the game's health value is stored as a 32-bit integer, which has a maximum value of 2,147,483,647. The health would be capped by this technical limitation. However, the theoretical model described by the game's scaling rule has no such cap.\n*   **Game Mode Specifics:** The scaling factor of +35% per player is specific to Expert Mode. Master Mode uses a different, more complex scaling formula, which would also result in infinite health but via a different function.\n*   **Linear Growth:** The key takeaway is that health scaling in Expert Mode is linear. Any linear function with a positive slope will approach infinity as its input approaches infinity. There is no mechanic in the game's code that diminishes the health gain for each additional player or caps the multiplier.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the linear health scaling formula used in Terraria's Expert Mode, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu will increase indefinitely as more players are added. Therefore, with a theoretical infinite number of players, the health would also be infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
