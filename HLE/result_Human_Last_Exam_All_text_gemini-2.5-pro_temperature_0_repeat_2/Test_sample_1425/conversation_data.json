    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using path integrals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function and Interpret the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function (Z) for a quantum system is defined as:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator (describing kinetic and potential energies).\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\text{Tr}[...]$ denotes the trace over all states in the Fock space.\n\nThe question specifies the Hamiltonian as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. This is an unusual form for a system Hamiltonian. The most standard and physically sensible interpretation in the context of a grand canonical ensemble is that the intrinsic Hamiltonian of the system is zero ($\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$), and the question is providing the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator directly, $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$.\nUnder this interpretation, we have:\n$\\hat{K} = 0 - \\mu \\hat{N} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$\nThe partition function is then:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}]$\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Partition Function as a Path Integral**\n\nThe partition function Z can be expressed as a path integral over quantum fields. The general form is:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\text{fields}] \\, e^{-S}$\nwhere S is the Euclidean action in imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$. The action is derived from the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}$. For a system with $\\hat{K} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$, the corresponding action S is given by:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_{GC}$\nThe Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_{GC}$ depends on whether the particles are bosons (described by a complex scalar field $\\phi$) or fermions (described by a Grassmann field $\\psi$).\nThe general form of the Lagrangian density is $\\mathcal{L}_{GC} = \\text{field}^\\dagger (\\partial_\\tau + H_{sys} - \\mu) \\text{field}$. Since we assume $\\hat{H}_{sys}=0$, this simplifies to:\n*   **For Bosons:** $S_B = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n*   **For Fermions:** $S_F = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Gaussian Path Integral**\n\nThe action is quadratic in the fields, which means the path integral is of Gaussian form. Such integrals can be evaluated in terms of the determinant of the operator in the action.\nLet's define the operator $M_{op} = \\partial_\\tau - \\mu$.\nThe path integral evaluates to:\n*   **For Bosons:** $Z_B = C_B \\cdot [\\det(M_{op})]^{-1}$\n*   **For Fermions:** $Z_F = C_F \\cdot \\det(M_{op})$\nwhere $C_B$ and $C_F$ are normalization constants. The determinant is taken over the entire function space. If the system consists of $M$ independent single-particle modes (e.g., $M$ lattice sites or momentum states), the total determinant is the product of the determinants for each mode.\n$Z \\propto (\\det(M_{op}))^{-\\eta M}$\nwhere $\\eta = +1$ for bosons and $\\eta = -1$ for fermions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Determinant using Matsubara Frequencies**\n\nTo calculate the determinant, we find its logarithm, which is the trace of the logarithm of the operator:\n$\\ln(\\det(M_{op})) = \\text{Tr}(\\ln(M_{op}))$\nThe trace is a sum over a complete set of basis states. We use the Fourier basis in imaginary time, characterized by the Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$.\n*   For bosons, fields are periodic in $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$, so $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   For fermions, fields are anti-periodic, so $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi / \\beta$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIn this basis, the operator $\\partial_\\tau$ has eigenvalues $-i\\omega_n$. Thus, the operator $M_{op} = \\partial_\\tau - \\mu$ has eigenvalues $(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\nThe trace becomes a sum over these eigenvalues (i.e., a sum over Matsubara frequencies):\n$\\ln(\\det(M_{op})) = \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Matsubara Summation**\n\nWe now evaluate the sum for each case using standard Matsubara summation formulas.\n\n*   **For Bosons ($\\eta = +1$):**\n    $\\ln Z_B = -M \\ln(\\det(M_{op})) = -M \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n    The relevant identity is $\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\epsilon) = \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\epsilon})$ for bosonic frequencies. We set $\\epsilon = -\\mu$.\n    $\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) = \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu})$\n    Therefore, $\\ln Z_B = -M \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu})$.\n    Exponentiating gives the partition function:\n    $Z_B = (1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu})^{-M} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}\\right)^M$\n    This result is valid for $\\mu < 0$ to ensure the convergence of the underlying geometric series of occupations.\n\n*   **For Fermions ($\\eta = -1$):**\n    $\\ln Z_F = +M \\ln(\\det(M_{op})) = M \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n    The relevant identity is $\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon) = \\ln(1 + e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})$ for fermionic frequencies. We write our term as $-i\\omega_n - \\mu = -i\\omega_n + (-\\mu)$ and set $\\epsilon = -\\mu$.\n    $\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) = \\ln(1 + e^{-\\beta(-\\mu)}) = \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n    Therefore, $\\ln Z_F = M \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$.\n    Exponentiating gives the partition function:\n    $Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\n**Step 6: Final Combined Answer**\n\nWe can write a single expression for the partition function that covers both bosons and fermions by using the parameter $\\eta$, where $\\eta=+1$ for bosons and $\\eta=-1$ for fermions. The number of single-particle states is denoted by $M$.\n\nThe partition function for a single mode is $(1 - \\eta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\eta}$. For a system with $M$ identical and independent modes, the total partition function is the product:\n$Z = \\left[ (1 - \\eta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\eta} \\right]^M = (1 - \\eta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\eta M}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z for a system with grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$, comprising $M$ independent single-particle states, is given by:\n$Z = (1 - \\eta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\eta M}$\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $M$ is the number of single-particle states in the system.\n*   $\\eta = +1$ for bosons (requiring $\\mu < 0$).\n*   $\\eta = -1$ for fermions.\n\nExplicitly:\n*   For a system of **bosons**: $Z_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n*   For a system of **fermions**: $Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$\n\n<<<The partition function is $Z = (1 - \\eta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\eta M}$, where $\\eta=+1$ for bosons and $\\eta=-1$ for fermions, and M is the number of single-particle states.>>>"
