    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the components involved: the logical fragment, the schema, and the definition of VC dimension in this context.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Logical Fragment and Schema\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A unary predicate takes a single argument.\n*   **Logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic (FO) that uses the predicates from $S$ and is restricted to the following logical symbols:\n    *   `∃`: The existential quantifier.\n    *   `∧`: Conjunction (logical AND).\n    *   `⊤`: The constant for True.\n    *   `⊥`: The constant for False.\n    *   Crucially, this logic does not include negation (`¬`), disjunction (`∨`), or the universal quantifier (`∀`).\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Formulas (Concepts)\n\nThe VC dimension is a measure of the complexity of a class of concepts. In our case, the concepts are the sets of elements defined by the formulas in our logic that have exactly one free variable. Let's analyze the structure of such a formula, $\\phi(x)$.\n\n1.  An atomic formula with a variable `z` must be of the form $P_i(z)$ since all predicates are unary.\n2.  A quantifier-free formula in this logic is a conjunction of atomic formulas, `⊤`, or `⊥`. For example, $P_1(y) \\land P_3(z)$.\n3.  A general formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable `x` is formed by existentially quantifying some variables in a quantifier-free formula. It will have the form:\n    $\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 ... \\exists y_k \\psi(x, y_1, ..., y_k)$\n    where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n4.  Since the predicates are unary, the variables in the atoms are not shared. So, $\\psi$ can be separated into parts based on the variable in each atom:\n    $\\psi(x, y_1, ..., y_k) = M_x(x) \\land M_1(y_1) \\land ... \\land M_k(y_k)$\n    where each $M_z(z)$ is a conjunction of atoms involving only the variable `z`. For example, $M_x(x)$ could be $P_1(x) \\land P_4(x)$. Such a conjunction is also called a **monotone monomial**.\n5.  Applying the existential quantifiers, the formula becomes:\n    $\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 ... \\exists y_k (M_x(x) \\land M_1(y_1) \\land ... \\land M_k(y_k))$\n    Using the property that $\\exists z (\\alpha \\land \\beta(z)) \\equiv \\alpha \\land \\exists z \\beta(z)$ when `z` is not free in $\\alpha$, we can rewrite this as:\n    $\\phi(x) = M_x(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 M_1(y_1)) \\land ... \\land (\\exists y_k M_k(y_k))$\n6.  Each part like $\\exists y_i M_i(y_i)$ is a **sentence** (a formula with no free variables). The conjunction of all these sentences is itself a sentence, let's call it $C$.\n    So, any formula $\\phi(x)$ in our logic is equivalent to one of the form:\n    $\\phi(x) \\equiv M(x) \\land C$\n    where $M(x)$ is a monotone monomial on the variable $x$, and $C$ is a sentence.\n\n### Step 3: Connecting to VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a logic is the size $d$ of the largest set of elements that can be **shattered**. A set of points $C_{pts} = \\{c_1, ..., c_d\\}$ is shattered if for every possible subset $C' \\subseteq C_{pts}$, there exists a formula $\\phi(x)$ in the logic and a structure (model) $\\mathcal{M}$ such that the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ is exactly $C'$.\n\nFor a given structure $\\mathcal{M}$, the sentence $C$ in our formula $\\phi(x) \\equiv M(x) \\land C$ is either true or false.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\models C$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $M(x)$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models C$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (which defines the empty set).\n\nThis means that for any given structure, the definable sets are a subset of those definable by the monotone monomials over the predicates $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. To find the VC dimension, we need to find the maximum shattering capacity over all possible structures. The most powerful class of concepts we can hope to generate is the full set of concepts defined by all monotone monomials.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the VC dimension of the class of concepts defined by **monotone monomials on 4 boolean variables**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the VC Dimension of Monotone Monomials on 4 Variables\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_4$ be the class of concepts on $\\{0,1\\}^4$ defined by monotone monomials over 4 variables (our 4 predicates).\n\n**Lower Bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)**\n\nWe need to show that there exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered. Let's choose a specific set of 4 points (i.e., define a structure over 4 elements) and show they can be shattered. A clever choice is the set of points represented by binary vectors with exactly 3 ones:\n*   $c_1 = (1, 1, 1, 0)$\n*   $c_2 = (1, 1, 0, 1)$\n*   $c_3 = (1, 0, 1, 1)$\n*   $c_4 = (0, 1, 1, 1)$\n\nLet's show we can form any subset of $C_{pts} = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$ using a monomial $M(x) = P_{i_1}(x) \\land ... \\land P_{i_k}(x)$.\n\n*   **Singleton sets**: To select $\\{c_1\\}$, we need a monomial true for $c_1$ but false for the others. The monomial $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x)$ works, as only $c_1$ has 1s in the first three positions. By symmetry, we can select any singleton $\\{c_i\\}$.\n*   **Pairs**: To select $\\{c_1, c_2\\}$, we find the predicates they have in common: $P_1$ and $P_2$. Let's try the monomial $M(x) = P_1(x) \\land P_2(x)$.\n    *   $M(c_1)$ is true. $M(c_2)$ is true.\n    *   $M(c_3)$ is false (since $P_2(c_3)$ is false).\n    *   $M(c_4)$ is false (since $P_1(c_4)$ is false).\n    It works. By symmetry, we can select any pair $\\{c_i, c_j\\}$.\n*   **Triples**: To select $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$, we find their common predicate: $P_1$. Let's try $M(x) = P_1(x)$.\n    *   $M(c_1), M(c_2), M(c_3)$ are all true.\n    *   $M(c_4)$ is false.\n    It works. By symmetry, we can select any triple.\n*   **Full set**: The monomial $\\top$ (the empty conjunction) selects all four points.\n*   **Empty set**: The monomial $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$ selects no points, as none of them have 1s in all four positions.\n\nSince we can generate all $2^4 = 16$ subsets, this set of 4 points is shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound (VC-dim $\\le 4$)**\n\nWe need to show that no set of 5 points can be shattered.\n*   The class of concepts is generated by the set of all monotone monomials on 4 predicates.\n*   A monomial is uniquely determined by the subset of predicates it contains. With 4 predicates, there are $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets of predicates.\n*   This means there are at most 16 distinct monomials (e.g., $\\top, P_1, P_2, P_1 \\land P_2, ...$).\n*   Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be the set of concepts (definable sets) generated by these monomials. The size of this set, $|\\mathcal{H}|$, is at most 16.\n*   To shatter a set of $d$ points, we must be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. The number of subsets we can generate is at most the number of available concepts, $|\\mathcal{H}|$.\n*   So, to shatter $d$ points, we need $2^d \\le |\\mathcal{H}| \\le 16$.\n*   If we try to shatter a set of $d=5$ points, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ distinct subsets.\n*   Since we only have at most 16 concepts, and $32 > 16$, it is impossible to shatter any set of 5 points.\n*   Therefore, the VC dimension is less than 5, i.e., VC-dim $\\le 4$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom the lower bound, we have VC-dim $\\ge 4$. From the upper bound, we have VC-dim $\\le 4$. Combining these, the VC dimension must be exactly 4."
