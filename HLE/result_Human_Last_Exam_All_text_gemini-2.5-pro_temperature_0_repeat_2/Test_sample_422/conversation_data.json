    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Concepts and Constraints\n\n*   **JTB Definition of Knowledge:** The question starts with the standard philosophical definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB). This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is True (T).\n    2.  S believes that P (B).\n    3.  S is justified in believing that P (J).\n*   **The Core Constraint:** The most important part of the question is the artificial constraint that our only available epistemic states are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This means any mental state concerning a proposition must be classified as one or the other. There is no third category for \"justified belief\" as distinct from Knowledge or Belief.\n*   **The Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are cases of justified true belief that intuitively do not seem to be knowledge, usually because of the role of luck. By excluding these, the question forces us to look for more fundamental structural problems with the JTB model under the given constraint.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Justification\" Condition under the Constraint\n\nThe \"J\" in JTB is the most complex condition. A justification for a belief is typically based on evidence, reasons, or other supporting beliefs. Let's see what happens when we try to ground this justification within our limited two-state system (Knowledge and Belief).\n\nFor a person to be justified in believing proposition P, their justification must rely on some other mental state about some evidence, Q. According to the constraint, this mental state about Q must be either **Knowledge** or **Belief**.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the First Problem - The Regress or Circularity of Justification\n\nThis analysis leads to a classic epistemological dilemma, often called Agrippa's Trilemma, but the constraint forces it into a specific form.\n\n*   **Option A: Justification is based on \"Belief\".** If the justification for P is just another *belief* Q (which is not knowledge), then Q itself lacks justification. Why should an unjustified belief be able to provide the robust justification required for knowledge? This seems to build knowledge on a foundation of sand. If you argue that belief Q must also be justified, it must be justified by another belief, R, and so on. This creates an **infinite regress**, where no belief is ever fundamentally justified.\n\n*   **Option B: Justification is based on \"Knowledge\".** To stop the infinite regress, one might argue that the justifying state must be stronger; it must be **Knowledge**. So, to know P, you must be justified, and that justification must be based on knowing some other proposition Q.\n\nThis leads to the first major problem: **Circularity**.\n\n*   The definition becomes: \"S knows P if and only if S has a true belief in P that is justified by S's **knowledge** of Q.\"\n*   Here, \"Knowledge\" is being defined in terms of itself. A definition cannot use the term it is trying to define. It's like defining a \"car\" as \"a vehicle that has all the properties of a car.\" It provides no new information and is logically invalid as a definition.\n\n**Careful Point:** The constraint (only Knowledge or Belief) forces this choice. Either justification is too weak (mere belief, leading to regress) or it creates a circular definition (requiring knowledge to create knowledge).\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing States that are NOT Knowledge\n\nNow, let's consider beliefs that fail to meet the JTB criteria. Specifically, let's analyze a **Justified False Belief**. This is a common and important epistemic category. For example, for centuries, people were justified in believing the sun revolved around the Earth based on the evidence available to them. Their belief was rational and justified, but false.\n\nLet's apply the constraint to this state:\n1.  The state is \"Justified False Belief\".\n2.  Is it Knowledge? No, because the \"True\" (T) condition fails.\n3.  According to the constraint, if it's not Knowledge, it must be categorized as **Belief**.\n\nNow, let's consider an **Unjustified False Belief**. For example, someone guesses wildly that the moon is made of cheese. This belief is unjustified and false.\n1.  The state is \"Unjustified False Belief\".\n2.  Is it Knowledge? No, it fails both the \"Justified\" (J) and \"True\" (T) conditions.\n3.  According to the constraint, if it's not Knowledge, it must be categorized as **Belief**.\n\n### Step 5: Deriving the Second Problem - The Collapse of Epistemic Distinctions\n\nThis analysis reveals the second major problem: **The inability to distinguish between justified and unjustified false beliefs.**\n\n*   Both a rationally held but mistaken belief (Justified False Belief) and a completely irrational guess (Unjustified False Belief) are forced into the same category: \"Belief\".\n*   This is a significant issue because the concept of justification is meant to be normativeâ€”it separates good reasoning from bad reasoning. By collapsing this distinction, the JTB model under this constraint loses a huge amount of its explanatory power. It can no longer account for the difference between someone who is being rational but is unfortunately wrong, and someone who is being irrational and is wrong. The role and value of justification are severely undermined for any belief that isn't knowledge.\n\n**Careful Point:** This problem is not about truth or falsity, but about the *quality* of the belief. The JTB framework is supposed to care about this quality via the \"J\" condition, but the two-state constraint prevents it from doing so for any belief that isn't also true.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nThe two problems the JTB definition runs into under the specified constraints are:\n\n1.  **Circularity of Definition:** The \"Justification\" condition for knowledge must be grounded in either another \"Belief\" or \"Knowledge\". If it is grounded in a mere belief, it leads to an infinite regress, as that belief would also need justification. If, to stop the regress, the justification must be grounded in **Knowledge**, then the definition of knowledge becomes circular (i.e., knowledge is defined as a belief justified by other knowledge).\n\n2.  **Inability to Account for Justified False Beliefs:** The JTB framework should be able to distinguish between a belief that is false despite being based on good reasons (a justified false belief) and one that is false and based on no reasons (an unjustified false belief). Under the constraint that only Knowledge and Belief exist as states, both of these cases must be categorized simply as \"Belief,\" since neither is knowledge (as they are false). This collapses a critical epistemic distinction and undermines the normative role of justification for any belief that is not true.\n\n<<<1. **Circularity of Definition**: If justification must be grounded in knowledge to be sufficiently strong, the definition of knowledge becomes circular. 2. **Inability to Account for Justified False Beliefs**: The model cannot distinguish between a justified false belief and an unjustified false belief, as both are relegated to the single category of \"Belief\", stripping justification of its meaning for beliefs that are not true.>>>"
