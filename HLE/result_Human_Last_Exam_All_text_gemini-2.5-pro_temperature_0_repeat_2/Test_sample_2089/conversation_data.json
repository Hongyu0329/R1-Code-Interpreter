    "This question describes a very specific scenario that strongly points to a famous scene in one particular Oscar-nominated film, although some of the details in the question may be slightly misremembered, which is common.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Film Type:** Oscar-nominated.\n*   **Character Action:** A character performs an action that seals their fate.\n*   **The Specific Action:** Saying \"Thank you.\"\n*   **The Location:** While boarding a bus.\n\n**Step 2: Search for a direct match.**\nA search for an Oscar-nominated film that precisely matches all these criteria (a character saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, which leads to their doom) does not yield a definitive result. This suggests that one or more of the details in the prompt might be a slight misremembering of a very similar and iconic scene.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the most probable candidate based on the core concept.**\nThe core concept is a character, likely a spy or someone in disguise, who is discovered because of a small, seemingly innocuous cultural mistake. The most famous modern example of this trope occurs in the film **Inglourious Basterds** (2009).\n\n**Step 4: Examine the relevant scene in *Inglourious Basterds*.**\n*   **Oscar Nomination:** The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n*   **The Character and Situation:** British commando Lt. Archie Hicox (played by Michael Fassbender) is undercover as a German SS officer. He is meeting a German film star, who is a double agent, in a basement tavern.\n*   **The Fatal Mistake:** The scene is not on a bus, but in a tavern. The character doesn't say \"Thank you,\" but he does make a fatal error. When he orders three drinks, he uses a hand gestureâ€”holding up his index, middle, and ring fingers.\n*   **Sealing His Fate:** A real German SS officer at the table, Major Hellstrom, notices the gesture. He knows that Germans count to three using their thumb, index, and middle fingers. This small cultural slip confirms his suspicion that Hicox is an imposter. This revelation leads directly to a standoff and a violent shootout in which Hicox is killed.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\nThe scene in *Inglourious Basterds* perfectly matches the spirit and dramatic function of the events described in the question, even if the specific details differ. A character's fate is sealed by a tiny, unconscious action that reveals his true identity. It is highly likely that this is the film being referenced, with the hand gesture being misremembered as the phrase \"Thank you,\" and the tavern setting being misremembered as a bus.\n\n<<<Inglourious Basterds>>>"
