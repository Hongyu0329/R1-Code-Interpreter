    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Current Word and its Origin:** The modern English word is \"sister\". We need to determine its etymology to see what influence the Norse had on it. The word \"sister\" comes from Old English, but its current form shows significant influence from Old Norse.\n\n2.  **Examine the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) Form:** The original, native Old English word for \"sister\" was **sweostor**. It is a cognate of words in other Germanic languages, such as German *Schwester* and Dutch *zuster*.\n\n3.  **Examine the Old Norse Form:** The Old Norse word for \"sister\" was **systir**. This word was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Influence:** When the Old Norse *systir* and the Old English *sweostor* coexisted, the Norse form began to influence the English one. The key changes are:\n    *   The vowel sound: The Old English diphthong `eo` in *sw**eo**stor* was replaced by the `y` (pronounced /i/) from the Norse *s**y**stir*.\n    *   The consonant cluster: While not a direct replacement, the simpler vowel sound of the Norse form made it more dominant, especially in the Danelaw region where Norse influence was strongest. The modern pronunciation of \"sister\" is closer to the Norse root than the Old English one.\n\n5.  **Hypothesize the Word's Evolution Without Norse Influence:** To figure out what *sweostor* would have become, we must look at how similar Old English words evolved into Modern English. We can use \"brother\" and \"mother\" as direct comparisons.\n    *   Old English: *brōþor* -> Modern English: *brother*\n    *   Old English: *mōdor* -> Modern English: *mother*\n    *   Old English: *sweostor* -> ???\n\n6.  **Apply English Sound Change Rules:**\n    *   **Initial Consonant Cluster:** The initial `sw-` sound is stable in English and would have likely remained (e.g., *swim*, *sweet*, *swan*).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The Old English diphthong `eo` in an unstressed or semi-stressed syllable typically simplified to `e` in Middle English. For example, OE *heofon* became ME *heven* (heaven).\n    *   **Final Syllable:** The unstressed final syllable `-or` in Old English consistently evolved into `-er` in Middle and Modern English. We see this clearly in *broth**or*** -> *broth**er*** and *moth**or*** -> *moth**er***.\n\n7.  **Construct the Hypothetical Word:** Applying these rules to the Old English *sweostor*:\n    *   The `sw-` remains.\n    *   The `-eo-` becomes `-e-`.\n    *   The `-st-` remains.\n    *   The `-or` becomes `-er`.\n    *   Combining these changes, the Old English *sweostor* would have naturally evolved into the Middle English form ***swester***. This form would have then carried into Modern English.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Hybrid Nature of \"Sister\":** It is crucial to recognize that the modern word \"sister\" is not a pure descendant of the Old English word but a hybrid form influenced by Old Norse.\n*   **Analogical Sound Change:** The evolution of words is not always perfectly regular, but using close analogies like \"brother\" and \"mother\" provides a very strong model for the expected development.\n*   **Dialectal Survival:** The form \"swester\" did, in fact, survive in some English dialects for centuries, which strongly supports this hypothesis. Its eventual replacement in Standard English by the Norse-influenced \"sister\" shows how significant the Viking interaction was.\n*   **Counterfactual Nature:** This is a historical \"what if\" question. The answer is a linguistic reconstruction based on known patterns, not an absolute certainty, but it is the most likely outcome based on the evidence.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of regular sound changes in the English language, the Old English word *sweostor*, without the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, would have evolved in the same manner as *broþor* (brother) and *modor* (mother). This would have resulted in the Modern English word being **swester**.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
