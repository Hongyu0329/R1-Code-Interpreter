    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of elements `g` in the group `G = PSU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1`.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Lifting the problem from PSU(4, q) to SU(4, q)**\n\nThe Projective Special Unitary group `PSU(n, q)` is defined as the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary group and `Z(SU(n, q))` is its center.\nLet `g` be an element of `PSU(4, 997)`. We can write `g = xZ` where `x` is an element of `SU(4, 997)` and `Z = Z(SU(4, 997))`.\n\nThe condition `g^2 = 1` (where 1 is the identity in `PSU`) translates to `(xZ)^2 = x^2Z = Z`. This means `x^2` must be an element of the center `Z`.\nThe condition `g ≠ 1` translates to `xZ ≠ Z`, which means `x` is not in the center `Z`.\n\nSo, our task is to count the number of cosets `xZ` such that `x ∈ SU(4, 997)`, `x^2 ∈ Z`, and `x ∉ Z`.\n\n**2. Determining the center Z(SU(4, 997))**\n\nThe center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that `λ^n = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\nFor our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\n`d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\nSince `4 = 2^2` and `998 = 2 × 499` (where 499 is prime), `d = 2`.\nSo, the center `Z(SU(4, 997))` has two elements. Since the characteristic of the field is not 2, these elements are `I` (the identity matrix) and `-I`.\n`Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n**3. Analyzing the condition `x^2 ∈ Z`**\n\nThe condition `x^2 ∈ {I, -I}` splits into two cases:\n*   Case A: `x^2 = I`\n*   Case B: `x^2 = -I`\n\n**Careful Point 1: Existence of solutions to `x^2 = -I`**\nAn element `x` in the unitary group `U(n, q)` satisfying `x^2 = -I` can only exist if `q ≡ 3 (mod 4)`.\nThis is because any eigenvalue `λ` of `x` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`. Also, for `x` to be unitary, its eigenvalues must satisfy `λ^(q+1) = 1`. Combining these, we get `(λ^2)^((q+1)/2) = (-1)^((q+1)/2) = 1`. This requires the exponent `(q+1)/2` to be an even number, which implies `q+1` is a multiple of 4, or `q ≡ 3 (mod 4)`.\n\nIn our problem, `q = 997`. Since `997 = 4 × 249 + 1`, we have `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`.\nTherefore, there are **no** elements `x` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `x^2 = -I`.\n\n**4. Analyzing the remaining case `x^2 = I`**\n\nWe only need to consider elements `x` such that `x^2 = I` and `x ∉ Z`.\nThe elements `x` with `x^2 = I` are the identity `I` and the involutions of `SU(4, 997)`.\nThe condition `x ∉ Z` means we exclude `I` and `-I`. So we are looking for the non-central involutions in `SU(4, 997)`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Conjugacy classes of involutions in SU(4, q)**\nThe involutions in `SU(n, q)` are conjugate to diagonal matrices of the form `t_k = diag(I_k, -I_{n-k})`. For `t_k` to be in `SU(n, q)`, its determinant must be 1. `det(t_k) = (-1)^(n-k) = 1`.\nFor `n=4`, this means `4-k` must be even, so `k` must be even. The possible values for `k` are 0, 2, 4.\n*   `k=4`: `t_4 = I`. This is in the center.\n*   `k=0`: `t_0 = -I`. This is in the center.\n*   `k=2`: `t_2 = diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`. This is not a scalar matrix, so it is not in the center.\n\nThus, all non-central involutions in `SU(4, 997)` belong to a single conjugacy class, the class `C` of `t = diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`.\n\n**5. Counting the involutions in PSU(4, 997)**\n\nThe involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` are the cosets `xZ` where `x` is in the class `C`. We need to find the number of distinct cosets formed by the elements of `C`.\nLet `x ∈ C`. The corresponding coset is `xZ = {x, -x}`.\nSince `t = diag(1, 1, -1, -1)` and `-t = diag(-1, -1, 1, 1)` are conjugate in `SU(4, q)`, if `x` is in `C`, then `-x` is also in `C`.\nAs `x` is an involution and not `I` or `-I`, `x ≠ -x`.\nThis means that each coset `xZ` (for `x ∈ C`) contains exactly two elements from `C`.\nTherefore, the total number of such cosets, which is the number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)`, is `|C| / 2`.\n\n**6. Calculating the size of the conjugacy class C**\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class `C` is given by the orbit-stabilizer theorem: `|C| = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(t)|`, where `C_{SU(4, q)}(t)` is the centralizer of `t` in `SU(4, q)`.\n\nThe centralizer of `t = diag(I_2, -I_2)` in `SU(4, q)` consists of block-diagonal matrices `diag(A, B)` where `A, B ∈ GU(2, q)` and `det(A)det(B) = 1`.\nThe size of this centralizer is `|C_{SU(4, q)}(t)| = (q+1)|SU(2, q)|^2`.\n\nThe orders of the SU groups are given by the formulas:\n*   `|SU(n, q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} ∏_{i=2}^{n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`\n*   `|SU(2, q)| = q(q^2 - 1)`\n*   `|SU(4, q)| = q^6 (q^2 - 1)(q^3 + 1)(q^4 - 1)`\n\nNow, we compute `|C|`:\n`|C| = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(t)| = [q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [(q+1)(q(q^2-1))^2]`\n`|C| = [q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q^2 (q+1)(q^2-1)^2]`\n`|C| = q^4 * [(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [(q+1)(q^2-1)]`\nUsing `q^3+1 = (q+1)(q^2-q+1)` and `q^4-1 = (q^2-1)(q^2+1)`:\n`|C| = q^4 * [(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)] / [(q+1)(q^2-1)]`\n`|C| = q^4 (q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `|C| / 2`.\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * q^4 (q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\nSubstitute `q = 997`:\n*   `q^2 = 997^2 = 994,009`\n*   `q^4 = (994,009)^2 = 988,053,892,081`\n*   `q^2 - q + 1 = 994,009 - 997 + 1 = 993,013`\n*   `q^2 + 1 = 994,009 + 1 = 994,010`\n\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * 988,053,892,081 * 993,013 * 994,010`\n= `988,053,892,081 * 993,013 * (994,010 / 2)`\n= `988,053,892,081 * 993,013 * 497,005`\n= `981,143,081,334,173 * 497,005`\n= `487,636,503,424,301,333,165`\n\n<<<487636503424301333165>>>"
