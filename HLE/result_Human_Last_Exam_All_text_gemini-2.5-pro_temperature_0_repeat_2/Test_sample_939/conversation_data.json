    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the concept of color gamuts. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) is a wide-gamut color space, meaning it can represent a very large range of colors. sRGB is a smaller-gamut color space, standard for web and most consumer displays. A color from a larger gamut might not exist within a smaller gamut. If a color is \"out-of-gamut,\" it cannot be accurately represented in the target color space. An sRGB hex code can only represent colors that are within the sRGB gamut.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\n\nTo check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space and see if the resulting values are valid.\n\n1.  **Linearization:** The given ROMM RGB values are non-linear (gamma-corrected). They must first be converted to linear values. The ROMM RGB transfer function (decoding) is:\n    *   `V_linear = V_nonlinear / 16`, if `V_nonlinear < 16/255`\n    *   `V_linear = (V_nonlinear)^1.8`, if `V_nonlinear >= 16/255`\n    (Note: `16/255` is approx `0.0627`. All non-zero values in the question are greater than this threshold).\n\n2.  **Color Space Transformation:** The linear ROMM RGB values are then converted to linear sRGB values using a standard 3x3 matrix multiplication. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors and white points (D50 for ROMM, D65 for sRGB). A standard matrix for this conversion is:\n    `[ R_sRGB_lin ]   [  2.035  -0.728  -0.305 ] [ R_ROMM_lin ]`\n    `[ G_sRGB_lin ] = [ -0.229   1.231  -0.003 ] [ G_ROMM_lin ]`\n    `[ B_sRGB_lin ]   [ -0.009  -0.154   1.160 ] [ B_ROMM_lin ]`\n\n3.  **Gamut Check:** A color is within the sRGB gamut if and only if all its linear sRGB components (`R_sRGB_lin`, `G_sRGB_lin`, `B_sRGB_lin`) are between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out-of-gamut and cannot be represented by a valid sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0, 0, 1^1.8)` = `(0, 0, 1)`\n*   **Transform:** `R_sRGB_lin = -0.305`, `G_sRGB_lin = -0.003`, `B_sRGB_lin = 1.160`\n*   **Gamut Check:** The R and G components are negative (< 0) and the B component is greater than 1. This color is out-of-gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0, 1^1.8, 0)` = `(0, 1, 0)`\n*   **Transform:** `R_sRGB_lin = -0.728`, `G_sRGB_lin = 1.231`, `B_sRGB_lin = -0.154`\n*   **Gamut Check:** The R and B components are negative (< 0) and the G component is greater than 1. This color is out-of-gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` ≈ `(0, 0.287, 0.398)`\n*   **Transform:** `R_sRGB_lin` = `(2.035 * 0) + (-0.728 * 0.287) + (-0.305 * 0.398)` ≈ `-0.330`\n*   **Gamut Check:** The R component is negative (< 0). We don't need to calculate the others to know it is out-of-gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` ≈ `(0.190, 0.287, 0.398)`\n*   **Transform:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin` ≈ `(2.035 * 0.190) + (-0.728 * 0.287) + (-0.305 * 0.398)` ≈ `0.057`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin` ≈ `(-0.229 * 0.190) + (1.231 * 0.287) + (-0.003 * 0.398)` ≈ `0.309`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin` ≈ `(-0.009 * 0.190) + (-0.154 * 0.287) + (1.160 * 0.398)` ≈ `0.416`\n*   **Gamut Check:** All components (0.057, 0.309, 0.416) are between 0 and 1. This color is in-gamut. **Can be represented.**\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8)` = `(1, 1, 1)`\n*   **Transform:** This represents the white point of the ROMM RGB space (D50). When converted to the sRGB space (which uses a D65 white point), the resulting coordinates are not `(1, 1, 1)`.\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin` = `2.035 - 0.728 - 0.305` = `1.002`\n*   **Gamut Check:** The R component is greater than 1. This color is out-of-gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3, 5>>>"
