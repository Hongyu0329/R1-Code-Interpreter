    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the specific range of verses (bayt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the names of the 25 prophets, whose knowledge is considered obligatory, are listed.\n\n2.  **Identify the Poem and its Structure:** The poem is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. It is a concise summary of the essential articles of Islamic faith (Aqeedah) according to the Ash'ari school. It covers the attributes of Allah, the attributes of the Prophets, the names of the Prophets, the angels, the divine books, the Last Day, and other related topics.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** The section on the Prophets (Anbiya' wa Rusul) is a key part of the poem. After discussing the four obligatory attributes of the prophets (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intellect), the author moves on to list their names.\n\n4.  **Find the Introductory Verse:** Before listing the names, the author has a verse that introduces the list. This is **bayt 28**:\n    > تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n    > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *Translation: The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every legally responsible person, so verify and seize [this knowledge].*\n    This verse tells us that the list is coming, but it does not contain the names themselves.\n\n5.  **Identify the Starting Verse of the List:** The very next verse, **bayt 29**, begins the enumeration of the prophets' names.\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ\n    > صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.*\n    This is the first verse that contains the names.\n\n6.  **Follow the List to its Conclusion:** The list continues over the next couple of verses.\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Lists Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 31:** Lists Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n7.  **Identify the Final Verse of the List:** The list of the 25 prophets concludes in **bayt 32**.\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُsسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n    > عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the seal [of the prophets], so leave misguidance.*\n    This verse contains the final names in the list, ending with Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n8.  **Synthesize the Range:** Based on the analysis, the names of the prophets begin in bayt 29 and end in bayt 32.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** The numbering (28, 29, 30, 31, 32) is based on the standard and most widely accepted editions of the poem. Minor variations might exist in some manuscripts, but this numbering is authoritative.\n*   **Introductory vs. Listing Verse:** It is important to distinguish between the verse that introduces the list (bayt 28) and the verses that actually contain the names (bayt 29-32). The question asks for where the *names are mentioned*.\n*   **Name for Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ):** In the final verse of the list (bayt 32), the author refers to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as \"Taha\" (طَهَ), which are the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from bayt 29 to bayt 32 in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'.\n\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 32>>>"
