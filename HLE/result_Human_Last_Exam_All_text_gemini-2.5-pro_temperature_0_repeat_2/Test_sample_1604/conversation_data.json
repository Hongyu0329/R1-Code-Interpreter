    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Artist and the Scope of the Question\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Southerden Butler (1846–1933), famously known as Lady Butler. She was a renowned British painter of military scenes. The question asks for the *latest historical battle* she depicted, not the last painting she created. This means we need to find the dates of the historical events shown in her paintings and identify the most recent one.\n\n### Step 2: Compile a List of Lady Butler's Battle Paintings and Their Historical Dates\nWe need to create a list of her major works that depict specific battles or military actions and note the year the event occurred.\n\n*   **\"The Roll Call\" (painted 1874):** Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman, which took place on **November 5, 1854**, during the Crimean War.\n*   **\"Quatre Bras\" (painted 1875):** Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   **\"Balaclava\" (painted 1876):** Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava on **October 25, 1854**, during the Crimean War.\n*   **\"The Remnants of an Army\" (painted 1879):** Depicts Dr. William Brydon's arrival at Jalalabad in **January 1842**, concluding the disastrous retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   **\"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\" (painted 1880):** Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift, which occurred on **January 22–23, 1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   **\"Scotland for Ever!\" (painted 1881):** Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   **\"Floreat Etona!\" (painted 1882):** Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek on **January 28, 1881**, during the First Boer War.\n*   **\"Tel-el-Kebir\" (painted 1885):** Depicts the Battle of Tel El Kebir on **September 13, 1882**, during the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n*   **\"The Camel Corps\" (painted c. 1893):** Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition of **1884–1885** during the Mahdist War in Sudan. A key engagement was the Battle of Abu Klea in January 1885.\n*   **\"In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\" (painted 1920):** Depicts the Great Retreat following the Battle of Mons, which began on **August 23, 1914**, during World War I.\n*   **\"The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916\" (painted 1917):** Depicts a cavalry charge during the Affair of Agagia on **February 26, 1916**. This was part of the Senussi Campaign in Egypt during World War I.\n\n### Step 3: Chronologically Order the Battles\nNow, let's arrange the historical events by their date to find the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Waterloo / Quatre Bras: **1815**\n2.  Retreat from Kabul: **1842**\n3.  Battle of Balaclava / Inkerman: **1854**\n4.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n5.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n6.  Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n7.  Gordon Relief Expedition: **1885**\n8.  Retreat from Mons: **1914**\n9.  Affair of Agagia: **1916**\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle\nBy comparing the dates, the latest historical event depicted by Lady Butler is the Affair of Agagia, which took place in 1916.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** It is crucial to distinguish between the year a painting was completed and the year the historical event it portrays occurred. The question specifically asks for the latest *historical* event.\n*   **Inclusion of Later Works:** Lady Butler lived until 1933 and continued to paint. Her works are not limited to the Victorian era; she also depicted scenes from World War I, which are essential for answering this question correctly.\n*   **Specificity of the Event:** The painting \"The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916\" is very specific, with the date included in the title, making it a clear point of reference.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nThe analysis shows a clear chronological progression of the battles Lady Butler painted. The events of World War I are the most recent. Between her two known World War I paintings, the \"Retreat from Mons\" depicts an event from 1914, while \"The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia\" depicts an event from 1916. Therefore, the battle depicted in the latter painting is the latest one historically.\n\n<<<The Affair of Agagia"
