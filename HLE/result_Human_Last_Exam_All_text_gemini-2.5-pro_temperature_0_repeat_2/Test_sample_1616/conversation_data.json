    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine if it has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a historical sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. This typically happens when a suffix is added to a base word. The rule can also apply to some two-syllable words where a suffix is added. The core idea is to check if a derived word with a lax vowel has a related base word with a tense vowel.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word:**\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Base Word:** `south`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Base:** /saʊθ/. The vowel sound /aʊ/ is a tense diphthong.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `southern`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Derived Word:** /ˈsʌðərn/. The vowel sound has changed to /ʌ/, which is a lax vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** The tense vowel /aʊ/ in `south` becomes the lax vowel /ʌ/ in `southern` due to the addition of the suffix `-ern`. This is a classic example of this type of vowel laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has undergone laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Base Word:** `derive`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Base:** /dɪˈraɪv/. The vowel sound /aɪ/ is a tense diphthong.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `derivative`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Derived Word:** /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/. The vowel sound has changed to /ɪ/, which is a lax vowel. The vowel is in the antepenultimate position of the stem (`-riv-`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The tense vowel /aɪ/ in `derive` becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in `derivative`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Base Word:** `serene`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Base:** /səˈriːn/. The vowel sound /iː/ (as in \"ee\") is a tense vowel.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `serenity`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Derived Word:** /səˈrɛnɪti/. The vowel sound has changed to /ɛ/ (as in \"dress\"), which is a lax vowel. The vowel is in the antepenultimate position.\n    *   **Analysis:** The tense vowel /iː/ in `serene` becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in `serenity`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Base Word:** `please`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Base:** /pliːz/. The vowel sound /iː/ is a tense vowel.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `pleasant`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Derived Word:** /ˈplɛzənt/. The vowel sound has changed to /ɛ/, which is a lax vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** The tense vowel /iː/ in `please` becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in `pleasant` due to the addition of the suffix `-ant`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has undergone laxing.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Related Base Word:** `grate` (as in `grateful`)\n    *   **Pronunciation of Base:** /ɡreɪt/. The vowel sound /eɪ/ (as in \"face\") is a tense vowel.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `gratitude`\n    *   **Pronunciation of Derived Word:** /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/. The first vowel sound is /æ/ (as in \"trap\"), which is a lax vowel. This vowel is in the antepenultimate position.\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel quality is related to the tense vowel /eɪ/ in `grate` and becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in `gratitude`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Pronunciation:** /ˈʃædoʊ/. The first vowel is /æ/, which is a lax vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to see if this word was formed by adding a suffix to a base word with a tense vowel. The related word is `shade` (/ʃeɪd/), which does have a tense vowel /eɪ/. However, `shadow` is not derived from `shade` by adding a suffix. Both words evolved separately from Old English (`sceadu` for shadow and `scead` for shade). The word `shadow` already had a short vowel in Old English. Therefore, its lax vowel is not the result of the trisyllabic laxing rule operating on a base like `shade`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nAll the words except `shadow` show a clear pattern where a tense vowel in a base word becomes lax in the derived form, which is the definition of trisyllabic laxing. The lax vowel in `shadow` has a different historical origin.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
