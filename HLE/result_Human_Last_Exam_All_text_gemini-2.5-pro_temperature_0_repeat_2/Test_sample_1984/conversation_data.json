    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$.\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions of the differential equation, which occur when $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$-x(x - 1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe roots of this equation are the equilibrium points. The solutions are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nTo determine the stability of each equilibrium point, we can use the linearization method (first derivative test) or a phase line analysis.\n\n**Method 1: Linearization**\nWe compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   **For $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization test is inconclusive for this equilibrium point. We must use another method to determine its stability.\n\n**Method 2: Phase Line Analysis**\nWe analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the intervals defined by the equilibrium points.\n*   **Interval $x < 0$:** Let's pick a test point, e.g., $x = -1$.\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1 - 1)^2 = 1(-2)^2 = 4 > 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) > 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is increasing in this interval, moving towards $x=0$.\n\n*   **Interval $0 < x < 1$:** Let's pick a test point, e.g., $x = 0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5 - 1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing in this interval, moving towards $x=0$.\n\n*   **Interval $x > 1$:** Let's pick a test point, e.g., $x = 2$.\n    $f(2) = -2(2 - 1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing in this interval, moving towards $x=1$.\n\n**Summary of Stability:**\n*   **For $x = 0$:** Solutions from both the left ($x<0$) and the right ($0<x<1$) move towards $x=0$. Therefore, $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point. This confirms the result from the linearization test.\n*   **For $x = 1$:** Solutions from the right ($x>1$) move towards $x=1$, but solutions from the left ($0<x<1$) move away from $x=1$ (towards $x=0$). An equilibrium point is only considered stable if solutions from *both* sides converge to it. Since solutions from one side move away, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as a **semi-stable** equilibrium, which is a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the value of m**\n\nThe problem defines $m$ as the number of **stable** equilibrium points. Based on our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe need to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m = 1$ into the expression, we get:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Factoring:** The polynomial $f(x)$ must be factored correctly to find all equilibrium points.\n2.  **Inconclusive Test:** Recognizing that the first derivative test is inconclusive when $f'(x^*) = 0$ is crucial.\n3.  **Definition of Stability:** A key point is the strict definition of a stable equilibrium. A semi-stable point is not stable because trajectories starting on one side of the equilibrium do not approach it.\n4.  **Phase Line Analysis:** The signs of $f(x)$ in the intervals between equilibrium points must be determined correctly to understand the direction of the flow.\n\nThe analysis leads to the conclusion that there is only one stable equilibrium point, $m=1$.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
