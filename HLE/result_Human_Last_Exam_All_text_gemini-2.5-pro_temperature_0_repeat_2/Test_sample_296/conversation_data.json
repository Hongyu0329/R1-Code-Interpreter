    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (G).\n\n### Step 1: Relate Subgroups of Index 4 to Group Actions\n\nThe number of subgroups of index 4 in a group `G` is equal to the number of distinct transitive actions of `G` on a set of 4 elements, up to equivalence. Each such action is defined by a homomorphism `ψ: G → S_4` where the image `ψ(G)` is a transitive subgroup of `S_4`. A subgroup `H` of index 4 is the stabilizer of a point in such an action.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Possible Image Groups\n\nThe Grigorchuk group `G` is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, any finite quotient of `G`, including the image `ψ(G)`, must also be a 2-group. We need to find the transitive subgroups of `S_4` that are also 2-groups.\n\nThe transitive subgroups of `S_4` are:\n1.  `S_4` (order 24, not a 2-group)\n2.  `A_4` (order 12, not a 2-group)\n3.  `D_4` (Dihedral group of order 8, a 2-group). There are three such subgroups in `S_4`, all conjugate.\n4.  `V_4` (Klein four-group, `Z_2 × Z_2`, order 4, a 2-group). There is one such subgroup in `S_4`.\n5.  `C_4` (Cyclic group of order 4, a 2-group). There are three such subgroups in `S_4`, all conjugate.\n\nSo, the image `ψ(G)` must be isomorphic to `C_4`, `V_4`, or `D_4`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Possible Image Group\n\n**Case A: Image is `C_4` (Cyclic group of order 4)**\n\n*   A homomorphism `ψ: G → A` to an abelian group `A` must factor through the abelianization of `G`, which is `G_{ab} = G/[G,G]`.\n*   The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be `G_{ab} ≅ Z_2 × Z_2`.\n*   So, any homomorphism `ψ: G → C_4` must factor as `G → G_{ab} → C_4`.\n*   The image of `G_{ab} ≅ Z_2 × Z_2` in `C_4` can have order at most 2, as every element in `Z_2 × Z_2` has order 1 or 2.\n*   Therefore, the homomorphism cannot be surjective (i.e., the image cannot be `C_4`).\n*   **Conclusion:** There are no subgroups of index 4 corresponding to an action with image `C_4`.\n\n**Case B: Image is `V_4` (Klein four-group)**\n\n*   If the image `ψ(G)` is `V_4`, the action corresponds to a homomorphism `ψ: G → V_4`.\n*   The kernel of this homomorphism, `H = Ker(ψ)`, is a normal subgroup of `G`.\n*   The index of `H` is `|G:H| = |V_4| = 4`. So, this case corresponds to finding the number of **normal** subgroups of index 4.\n*   Since `V_4 ≅ Z_2 × Z_2` is abelian, such homomorphisms factor through `G_{ab} ≅ Z_2 × Z_2`.\n*   We are looking for surjective homomorphisms `G → V_4`, which correspond to surjective homomorphisms (isomorphisms) from `G_{ab}` to `V_4`.\n*   The number of isomorphisms from `Z_2 × Z_2` to `V_4` is given by `|Aut(Z_2 × Z_2)| = |GL(2, 2)| = (2^2 - 1)(2^2 - 2) = 3 × 2 = 6`.\n*   These 6 different surjective homomorphisms result in subgroups that are kernels. Two homomorphisms `ψ_1` and `ψ_2` have the same kernel if and only if `ψ_2 = α ∘ ψ_1` for some automorphism `α` of the image group `V_4`.\n*   The number of distinct normal subgroups is `|Epi(G, V_4)| / |Aut(V_4)|`.\n*   `|Aut(V_4)| = |Aut(Z_2 × Z_2)| = 6`.\n*   Number of subgroups = `6 / 6 = 1`.\n*   **Conclusion:** There is exactly **1** normal subgroup of index 4.\n\n**Case C: Image is `D_4` (Dihedral group of order 8)**\n\n*   If the image `ψ(G)` is `D_4`, the action is on the 4 cosets of a subgroup `H` of index 4.\n*   The kernel of the action is `N = Core(H) = ∩_{g∈G} gHg^{-1}`.\n*   The image is isomorphic to the quotient group `G/N`, so `G/N ≅ D_4`. This means `N` is a normal subgroup of index 8 in `G`.\n*   The subgroup `H` contains `N`. By the correspondence theorem, `H/N` is a subgroup of `G/N ≅ D_4`.\n*   The index of `H/N` in `G/N` is equal to the index of `H` in `G`, which is 4. So, `H/N` is a subgroup of order `|D_4|/4 = 8/4 = 2` in `D_4`.\n*   Furthermore, the core of `H` is `N`. This implies that the core of the subgroup `H/N` in `G/N` must be the trivial subgroup.\n*   The problem now splits into two parts:\n    1.  Find the number of normal subgroups `N` in `G` such that `G/N ≅ D_4`.\n    2.  For each such `N`, find the number of subgroups of order 2 in `D_4` that have a trivial core.\n\n*   **Part 1:** It is a known result from the study of the Grigorchuk group that it has exactly **3** normal subgroups `N` for which the quotient `G/N` is isomorphic to `D_4`.\n\n*   **Part 2:** We need to find the subgroups of order 2 in `D_4` with a trivial core. `D_4` has 5 elements of order 2 (involutions), which generate 5 distinct subgroups of order 2.\n    *   One involution, `r^2` (rotation by 180°), is the center of `D_4`. The subgroup `<r^2>` is therefore normal, and its core is itself, which is not trivial.\n    *   The other four involutions are reflections (`s, sr, sr^2, sr^3`). The subgroups they generate are not normal. The core of a subgroup `K` is the intersection of all its conjugates. For any of these four subgroups (e.g., `K=<s>`), its conjugates are `<s>` and `<sr^2>`. Their intersection is the trivial subgroup `{e}`. The same holds for `<sr>` and its conjugate `<sr^3>`. Thus, all **4** of these subgroups have a trivial core.\n\n*   **Combining the parts:** For each of the 3 normal subgroups `N` with quotient `D_4`, there are 4 subgroups of order 2 in the quotient with trivial core. Each of these corresponds to a unique subgroup `H` of index 4 in `G`.\n*   This gives `3 × 4 = 12` subgroups. These are all non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the numbers from all possible cases.\n*   From Case B (image `V_4`): 1 subgroup (which is normal).\n*   From Case C (image `D_4`): 12 subgroups (which are non-normal).\n\nTotal number of subgroups of index 4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
