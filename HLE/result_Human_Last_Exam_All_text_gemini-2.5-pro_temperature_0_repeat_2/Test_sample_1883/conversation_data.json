    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of the two isomer products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction and Governing Principle**\nThe starting material is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. Under thermal conditions, it undergoes an electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. The reacting part of the molecule is the conjugated octatetraene system from C2 to C9. This system contains 8 π-electrons. According to Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory and the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a system with 4n π-electrons (here, n=2, so 8 π-electrons) undergoes a conrotatory ring closure under thermal conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Products**\nThe ring closure occurs between C2 and C9, forming a new sigma bond. This creates an 8-membered ring, 5,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,6-triene. The substituents on the new stereocenters (C5 and C8 in the product, corresponding to C2 and C9 in the reactant) are a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. The two products, A and B, are the *cis* and *trans* diastereomers with respect to the two methyl groups.\n*   **Isomer A (cis):** The two methyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n*   **Isomer B (trans):** The two methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Transition States for Product Formation**\nThe ratio of the products is determined by kinetic control, meaning it depends on the relative free energies of the transition states leading to each product. The lower the activation energy, the faster the reaction and the more abundant the product. The ratio is given by the equation:\nRatio [A]/[B] = k_A / k_B = exp(-ΔΔG‡ / RT), where ΔΔG‡ = G‡(A) - G‡(B).\n\nWe need to compare the stability of the transition state leading to the cis-isomer (TS_A) with the one leading to the trans-isomer (TS_B). The key difference in stability comes from the steric interactions between the substituents (Me and H) on the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) as they rotate during the conrotatory closure.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Steric Interactions in the Transition States**\nIn a conrotatory process, the substituents on the terminal carbons rotate to their final positions in the product. The steric strain in the transition state arises from the groups that move towards each other to become *cis* in the final ring.\n\n*   **Formation of trans-isomer B:** To form the *trans* product, one methyl group and one hydrogen atom must end up on the same side of the ring, and the other Me/H pair on the other side. This means that in the transition state (TS_B), a methyl group on one end and a hydrogen atom on the other end are moving towards each other. There are two such Me-H interactions. The steric strain in TS_B is therefore proportional to 2 × E(Me-H), where E(Me-H) is the steric repulsion energy between a methyl and a hydrogen group.\n\n*   **Formation of cis-isomer A:** To form the *cis* product, both methyl groups must end up on the same side of the ring, and both hydrogen atoms on the other. This means that in the transition state (TS_A), the two bulky methyl groups are moving towards each other, and the two small hydrogen atoms are moving towards each other. The steric strain in TS_A is therefore proportional to E(Me-Me) + E(H-H).\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Energies of the Transition States**\nWe now compare the steric strain in the two transition states:\n*   Strain(TS_A) ≈ E(Me-Me) + E(H-H)\n*   Strain(TS_B) ≈ 2 × E(Me-H)\n\nA methyl group is significantly larger than a hydrogen atom. Therefore, the steric repulsion energies follow the trend: E(Me-Me) >> E(Me-H) > E(H-H) ≈ 0.\nThe severe steric clash between two methyl groups in TS_A makes it much higher in energy than TS_B, where there are only two less severe methyl-hydrogen clashes.\nThus, G‡(A) > G‡(B).\n\n**Step 6: Predict the Product Ratio**\nSince the transition state leading to the trans-isomer (B) is lower in energy, this pathway is faster, and the trans-isomer (B) will be the major product. The cis-isomer (A) will be the minor product. The ratio A/B will be less than 1.\n\nTo obtain a numerical value for the ratio, we need to estimate the energy difference, ΔΔG‡ = G‡(A) - G‡(B). This is approximately the difference in steric strain:\nΔΔG‡ ≈ [E(Me-Me) + E(H-H)] - [2 × E(Me-H)]\nUsing typical values from conformational analysis, the energy cost of a gauche-butane (Me-Me) interaction is about 0.9 kcal/mol, while a 1,3-diaxial (Me-H) interaction is also about 0.9 kcal/mol. However, the clash in the transition state is more severe. A reasonable estimate for the difference in strain, ΔΔG‡, is in the range of 1.5-2.0 kcal/mol. Let's use a representative value of ΔΔG‡ ≈ 1.7 kcal/mol.\n\nAssuming the reaction is run at a typical temperature for thermal reactions, such as 100 °C (373 K), we can calculate the ratio:\nR = 1.987 cal mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ = 0.001987 kcal mol⁻¹ K⁻¹\nRT = 0.001987 kcal mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ × 373 K ≈ 0.74 kcal/mol\nRatio A/B = exp(-ΔΔG‡ / RT) = exp(-1.7 / 0.74) ≈ exp(-2.3) ≈ 0.1\n\nThis means the ratio of A:B is approximately 1:10.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of A and B. This is A/B.\n\nFinal Answer: The ratio of A (cis) to B (trans) is predicted to be 1:10. The numerical value of the ratio A/B is 0.1.\n\n<<<0.1>>>"
