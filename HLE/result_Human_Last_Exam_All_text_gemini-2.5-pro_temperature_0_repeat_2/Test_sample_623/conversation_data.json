    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Starting Molecule**\nThe starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means that in the 6-carbon glucose molecule, the carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde carbon) and position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. All other carbons are the standard ¹²C.\n\n```\n      ¹³CHO  (C1)\n      |\nH - C - OH (C2)\n      |\nHO- C - H  (C3)\n      |\nH - ¹³C - OH (C4)\n      |\nH - C - OH (C5)\n      |\n      CH2OH (C6)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Labeled Carbons Through Glycolysis to Pyruvate**\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. We need to follow the ¹³C labels through this process.\n\n1.  **Formation of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP):** The initial steps of glycolysis convert glucose into FBP. These steps (phosphorylations and an isomerization) do not change the carbon skeleton's numbering. Therefore, FBP is also labeled at C1 and C4.\n\n2.  **Cleavage of FBP:** The enzyme aldolase cleaves the 6-carbon FBP molecule into two 3-carbon molecules:\n    *   **Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP):** Formed from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of FBP. It contains the ¹³C label from C1 of glucose. This label is at the C1 position of DHAP.\n    *   **Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P):** Formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of FBP. It contains the ¹³C label from C4 of glucose. This label is at the C1 position of G3P (since C4 of glucose becomes C1 of this G3P molecule).\n\n3.  **Isomerization of DHAP:** The DHAP molecule is rapidly converted into another molecule of G3P by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase. The carbon atoms are not rearranged in this process (C1 of DHAP becomes C1 of G3P). So, this second G3P molecule is also labeled at its C1 position.\n\n4.  **Formation of Pyruvate:** At this point, we have two molecules of G3P, and both are labeled with ¹³C at their C1 position. The subsequent steps of glycolysis convert each G3P molecule into a pyruvate molecule. During this conversion, the C1 of G3P (an aldehyde carbon) becomes the C1 of pyruvate (a carboxyl carbon).\n\n**Conclusion of Glycolysis:** The end product of glycolysis from one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose is **two molecules of pyruvate**, both of which are labeled with ¹³C at the C1 (carboxyl) position.\n`Pyruvate: ¹³COO⁻ (C1) - C=O (C2) - CH₃ (C3)`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Release of CO₂**\nThe question asks how many ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules will be released.\n\n*   **During Glycolysis:** The process of glycolysis itself (glucose → 2 pyruvate) does not produce any CO₂.\n*   **After Glycolysis (Pyruvate Decarboxylation):** CO₂ is produced from the product of glycolysis, pyruvate, in the next step of aerobic respiration. This step is called the link reaction or pyruvate decarboxylation, catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This reaction converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA.\n*   **The Reaction:** `Pyruvate + CoA + NAD⁺ → Acetyl-CoA + CO₂ + NADH`\n*   **Fate of the Label:** In this decarboxylation reaction, the C1 carboxyl group (`-COO⁻`) of pyruvate is removed and released as CO₂.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Number of Labeled CO₂ Molecules**\nSince we have two molecules of pyruvate, and both are labeled with ¹³C at the C1 position, each molecule will release one molecule of ¹³CO₂ during pyruvate decarboxylation.\n\n*   Pyruvate molecule 1 (labeled at C1) → 1 molecule of ¹³CO₂\n*   Pyruvate molecule 2 (labeled at C1) → 1 molecule of ¹³CO₂\n\nTherefore, a total of two ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules will be released.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question implies following the metabolic fate of the carbons from glucose to the point of CO₂ release, which occurs after the glycolytic pathway is complete.\n*   It is crucial to correctly trace the carbons through the aldolase cleavage and triose phosphate isomerase steps. A common mistake is to incorrectly track the label from DHAP.\n*   Knowing that it is the C1 of pyruvate that is specifically lost as CO₂ in the link reaction is essential to reaching the correct answer. The other two carbons of pyruvate go on to form acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n1 molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose → 2 molecules of 1-¹³C pyruvate → 2 molecules of ¹³CO₂\n\n<<<2>>>"
