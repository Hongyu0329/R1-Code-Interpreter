    "An analysis of the question of computing the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the term \"Generalized Markov Number \\( m_{p/q} \\)\"**\n\nThe classical Markov numbers are integers \\(m\\) that are part of a solution \\((x, y, m)\\) to the Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). The first few are 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, ...\n\nThe concept can be generalized by associating a number, denoted \\(m_{p/q}\\), to every rational number \\(p/q\\). This association is made via the structure of the Stern-Brocot tree (or Farey tree) of rational numbers. The numbers \\(m_{p/q}\\) generated this way are precisely the classical Markov numbers, but indexed by rationals.\n\nThe key to computing these numbers is a recurrence relation defined on the tree of rationals. If \\(p/q\\) and \\(p'/q'\\) are Farey neighbors (i.e., \\(p'q - pq' = \\pm 1\\)), their mediant is \\((p+p')/(q+q')\\). The associated Markov numbers satisfy the following recurrence relation:\n\\[ m_{(p+p')/(q+q')} = 3 \\cdot m_{p/q} \\cdot m_{p'/q'} - m_{(p-p')/(q-q')} \\]\nHere, \\((p-p')/(q-q')\\) corresponds to the \"grandparent\" of the mediant in the tree.\n\n**2. Finding the value of \\( m_{4/7} \\)**\n\nTo compute \\(m_{4/7}\\), we need to find its \"parents\" in the Farey tree and its corresponding \"grandparent\".\n\n*   **Base Cases:** The tree of rationals in \\((0,1)\\) is generated from \\(0/1\\) and \\(1/1\\). The associated base values are taken to be \\(m_{0/1} = 1\\) and \\(m_{1/1} = 1\\).\n\n*   **Finding the parents of 4/7:** We need to find two fractions \\(p/q\\) and \\(p'/q'\\) such that their mediant is \\(4/7\\). We can see that \\(4/7 = (1+3)/(2+5)\\). So, the parents are \\(1/2\\) and \\(3/5\\). Let's verify they are Farey neighbors: \\(3 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 5 = 6 - 5 = 1\\). Yes, they are.\n\n*   **Applying the recurrence:**\n    Let \\(p/q = 3/5\\) and \\(p'/q' = 1/2\\).\n    The mediant is \\((3+1)/(5+2) = 4/7\\).\n    The grandparent is \\((p-p')/(q-q') = (3-1)/(5-2) = 2/3\\).\n    The recurrence relation gives:\n    \\[ m_{4/7} = 3 \\cdot m_{3/5} \\cdot m_{1/2} - m_{2/3} \\]\n\n*   **Computing the necessary values:** We need to compute \\(m_{1/2}\\), \\(m_{2/3}\\), and \\(m_{3/5}\\). We do this by tracing their lineage back to \\(0/1\\) and \\(1/1\\).\n\n    *   **Compute \\(m_{1/2}\\):** Parents are \\(1/1\\) and \\(0/1\\). Grandparent is \\(1/1\\).\n        \\(m_{1/2} = 3 \\cdot m_{1/1} \\cdot m_{0/1} - m_{1/1} = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 = 2\\).\n\n    *   **Compute \\(m_{2/3}\\):** Parents are \\(1/1\\) and \\(1/2\\). Grandparent is \\(0/1\\).\n        \\(m_{2/3} = 3 \\cdot m_{1/1} \\cdot m_{1/2} - m_{0/1} = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 - 1 = 5\\).\n\n    *   **Compute \\(m_{3/5}\\):** Parents are \\(1/2\\) and \\(2/3\\). Grandparent is \\(1/1\\).\n        \\(m_{3/5} = 3 \\cdot m_{1/2} \\cdot m_{2/3} - m_{1/1} = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29\\).\n\n*   **Final calculation for \\(m_{4/7}\\):**\n    Now we substitute these values back into the equation for \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n    \\[ m_{4/7} = 3 \\cdot m_{3/5} \\cdot m_{1/2} - m_{2/3} = 3 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 2 - 5 \\]\n    \\[ m_{4/7} = 6 \\cdot 29 - 5 = 174 - 5 = 169 \\]\n\n**3. Finding the Continued Fraction**\n\nThe question asks for the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\). We have found that the value of this number is 169.\n\n*   The number is an integer.\n*   The continued fraction of an integer \\(N\\) is simply \\([N]\\).\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction of 169 is \\([169]\\).\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Definition:** The crucial step is identifying the correct definition of a \"generalized Markov number\". Other interpretations, such as constructing a periodic continued fraction from the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\), are either ambiguous or inconsistent with known properties of the Markov spectrum. The recurrence relation on the Farey tree is a standard and computable definition.\n2.  **Recurrence Formula:** The formula \\(m_{p \\oplus p'} = 3 m_p m_{p'} - m_{p \\ominus p'}\\) must be applied correctly, which requires identifying the two parents and the grandparent in the Farey tree structure.\n3.  **Calculation:** The calculation must be done carefully, building up from the base cases \\(m_{0/1}=1\\) and \\(m_{1/1}=1\\).\n4.  **Final Answer Format:** The question asks for a continued fraction, not just the numerical value. For an integer result, the format is simple, but it's an important final step.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is computed using the recurrence relation on the Farey tree of rationals. The calculation yields the integer value 169. The continued fraction of the integer 169 is simply \\([169]\\).\n\n<<<[169]>>>"
