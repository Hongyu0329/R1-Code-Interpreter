    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is constructed from 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. A crucial property is that its 12 vertices are arranged in the exact same positions as the vertices of a regular (convex) icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe \"outer-hull\" of a shape is its convex hull. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that encloses all the points of the original object. You can visualize this as stretching a rubber sheet over the outermost points (the vertices) of the object.\nSince the 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are in the same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron, its convex hull is a **regular icosahedron**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Surface of the Outer-Hull**\nThe question asks for the number of triangles needed to triangulate this outer-hull. The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron. By definition, a regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Minimal Triangulation**\nA \"triangulation\" of a surface means dividing it into a set of triangles. The question asks for the *minimal* number of triangles. Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already perfectly divided into 20 triangular faces, this is the most natural and minimal triangulation. Any attempt to use fewer triangles would fail to represent the shape of the icosahedron. The phrase \"the number of visible triangles from the outside\" confirms that we are simply being asked to count the faces of the convex hull.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nThe number of faces on a regular icosahedron is given by its name: \"icosa-\" comes from the Greek word for twenty (\"eikosi\"). Therefore, a regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The surface of a regular icosahedron is composed of 20 triangles. This is the minimal number of triangles required to form its surface.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Do not confuse the 20 intersecting faces of the great icosahedron itself with the 20 non-intersecting faces of its outer-hull. The question is specifically about the outer-hull.\n*   Recognize that \"outer-hull\" and \"convex hull\" are synonymous in this context.\n*   Understand that \"minimal triangulation\" of a shape that is already made of triangles is simply the number of its triangular faces.\n\nThe final answer is the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\n<<<20>>>"
