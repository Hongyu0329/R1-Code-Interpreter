    print("- The patient's changing mole is highly suspicious for a primary malignant melanoma.")
    print("- The new skin spots, hip pain, and cardiopulmonary symptoms (shortness of breath, chest discomfort, swelling) indicate the cancer has spread (metastasized).")

    print("- The core problem is widespread cancer, so the treatment must be systemic (body-wide).")
