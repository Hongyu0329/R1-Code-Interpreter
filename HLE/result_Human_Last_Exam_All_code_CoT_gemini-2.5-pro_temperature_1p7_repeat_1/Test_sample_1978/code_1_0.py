# Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system, n.
# Based on the definition of matrix A and vector I(t), which have 202000 components,
# the dimension of the system is n = 202000.
n = 202000

# Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, k.
# The boundary conditions provided are:
# 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0
# 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0
# 3. 5x_2(T) - 5x_2(0) = 0 (redundant)
# 4. 100x_2(T) - 100x_2(0) = 0 (redundant)
# 5. 1000x_2(0) - 1000x_2(T) = 0 (redundant)
# 6. 100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0 (simplifies to x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0)
# Counting the unique, linearly independent conditions gives us k = 3.
k = 3

# Step 3: Calculate the index of the boundary-value problem.
# The index is given by the formula: Index = n - k.
index = n - k

# Print the final calculation and the result.
print(f"The dimension of the system is n = {n}.")
print(f"The number of independent boundary conditions is k = {k}.")
print("The index of the problem is calculated as follows:")
print(f"Index = n - k = {n} - {k} = {index}")
