    Conclusion:
    Given the complex nature of the dispute involving contracts, joint ventures, and financial disclosures over 6 properties since 2017, and the explicit need for a quick resolution, the Commercial List is the most suitable forum. It is specifically designed for such cases and is known for its efficiency and expert case management, making it the best choice over the general Superior Court of Justice.
