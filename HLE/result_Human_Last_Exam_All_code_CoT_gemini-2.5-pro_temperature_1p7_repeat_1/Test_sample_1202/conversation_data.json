    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Goal:** The user wants to find the correct answer to a multiple-choice question about evolutionary genetics. The answer should be delivered within a Python script that explains the reasoning.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Scientific Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Fate of duplicate genes.\n    *   **Key Processes:** Gene duplication creates a second copy of a gene. What happens next?\n    *   **Required Outcome:** The mechanism must explain both **retention** (the duplicate gene is kept in the genome, not lost) and **divergence** (the two gene copies become different over time).\n    *   **Constraint:** \"most likely\" mechanism.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a mechanism where one DNA sequence replaces another. Between duplicate genes, it tends to make them more *similar* (homogenization). This works *against* divergence. So, A is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is when a gene copy accumulates mutations that make it non-functional. It becomes a \"pseudogene.\" This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene, but it represents gene *loss*, not *retention* with a function. So, B is incorrect.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one gene copy keeps the original function, while the second copy is free to mutate. By chance, it might acquire a mutation that gives it a brand-new, beneficial function. Natural selection would then act to *retain* this divergent copy. This explains both retention and divergence. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., it was active in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that knock out *different* sub-functions. For instance, copy 1 loses the function for tissue A, and copy 2 loses the function for tissue B. Now, both copies are required to be *retained* to perform the full original role. This process inherently involves *divergence* (through mutation) and leads to retention. This is also a very strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macro-evolutionary term describing the rapid diversification of a group of organisms into new ecological niches. It's a pattern of speciation, not a molecular mechanism affecting a single gene. It's the wrong level of analysis. So, E is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strong Candidates (C vs. D):**\n    *   Both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted, important mechanisms that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    *   The question asks for the \"most likely\" one. This implies a comparison of frequency or probability.\n    *   Subfunctionalization can happen through relatively common degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations. It provides a passive route to preserving both gene copies without needing a rare, beneficial, new-function mutation to occur first.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a rarer event: a gain-of-function mutation that is also beneficial.\n    *   Because subfunctionalization provides a quicker and more probable pathway for *initial retention*, many evolutionary biologists argue it is a more common fate for duplicates than immediate neofunctionalization. It effectively creates a \"safe harbor\" for duplicated genes, which might later evolve new functions. Therefore, Subfunctionalization is arguably the \"most likely\" mechanism for retention.\n\n5.  **Plan the Python Script:**\n    *   The script will not compute the answer but will present the logical deduction in a structured way.\n    *   It will define all the choices.\n    *   It will provide a step-by-step analysis of each choice, explaining why it's correct or incorrect.\n    *   It will specifically compare the two strong candidates (C and D).\n    *   Following the quirky instruction, \"output each number in the final equation\", I will create a summary that looks a bit like a series of logical steps leading to a final answer, e.g., \"Step 1: Analyze A -> Reject\", \"Step 2: Analyze B -> Reject\", etc., and conclude with \"Final Answer = D\".\n    *   The final output will be printed to the console.\n\nThis thought process directly leads to the Python code provided, which systematically explains the science and justifies the final choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes\n    and prints the reasoning to determine the most likely answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the answer choices and their scientific meaning.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    explanations = {\n        'A': \"This process tends to make duplicate genes more similar (homogenize), which opposes divergence.
