# This script determines the relationship between the concentration of 3-Hydroxypropionate ([B])
# and PEP ([F]) based on the provided metabolic pathway.

# The direct pathway from [B] to [F] is:
# 3-Hydroxypropionate -k2-> Malonyl-CoA -k3-> Acetyl-CoA -k4-> Pyruvate -k5-> PEP

# Assuming the concentration of each product is proportional to its precursor and the rate constant,
# the final concentration of PEP ([F]) is proportional to the initial concentration of
# 3-Hydroxypropionate ([B]) multiplied by the rate constants of each step in the direct pathway.

# The derived relationship is [F] ∝ [B] * k2 * k3 * k4 * k5.
# The following code prints this relationship.

print("The relationship between [F] and [B] is represented by the expression:")
print("[F] ∝ [B] * k2 * k3 * k4 * k5")
