    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:

    1.  **Identify the Functional and its Minimum:**
        The functional is J(μ) = (1/2) * W(μ, ν)^2, where W(μ, ν) is the 2-Wasserstein distance.
        The Wasserstein distance W(μ, ν) is a metric, so it is non-negative, i.e., W(μ, ν) >= 0.
        It equals zero if and only if μ = ν.
        Consequently, the functional J(μ) is also non-negative and its minimum value is J(ν) = 0, which is uniquely achieved at μ = ν.

    2.  **Subgradient and Differentiability:**
        The functional J(μ) is known to be geodesically convex on the Wasserstein space. For a convex functional, a point is a minimum if and only if the zero vector is an element of its subgradient.
        Furthermore, J(μ) is differentiable (in the Wasserstein sense) for measures that are not single points.
        For a convex and differentiable functional, the subgradient at any point μ, denoted ∂J(μ), is a singleton set containing only the gradient vector: ∂J(μ) = {grad J(μ)}.

    3.  **Compute the Gradient at the Minimum Point:**
        The gradient of J(μ) at a point μ is given by the tangent vector field v(x) = x - T(x), where T is the optimal transport map that pushes ν to μ (T = T_{ν→μ}).
        We need to compute this gradient at the minimum point, which is μ = ν.
        So we need the optimal transport map from ν to itself, T_{ν→ν}. To transport a measure to itself, no mass needs to be moved. Thus, the optimal map is the identity map:
        T_{ν→ν}(x) = id(x) = x.

    4.  **Final Equation and Conclusion:**
        Substituting the identity map into the formula for the gradient at μ = ν gives:
        grad J(ν) = x - T_{ν→ν}(x)
        grad J(ν) = x - x
        grad J(ν) = 0
        
        The resulting gradient is the zero vector field. This corresponds to the trivial tangent vector at the point ν in the tangent space T_ν P(R^d).
        Since the subgradient at this point is ∂J(ν) = {grad J(ν)}, we have ∂J(ν) = {0}.
        
        Therefore, the statement is true. The regular subgradient of J at its minimum is the trivial tangent vector.
