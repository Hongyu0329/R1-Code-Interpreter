    print("  - GTO Verdict: This reason REMAINS VALID.")
    print("  - Explanation: Denying equity is a fundamental part of GTO. Betting forces drawing hands to pay to realize their equity. A GTO strategy meticulously calculates bet sizes to make calling with many draws an unprofitable (negative EV) play for the opponent. This is inseparable from value betting.\n")

    # Analysis of Reason 4
    print(f"Reason {4}: '{reasons[4]}'")
    print("  - GTO Verdict: This reason DISAPPEARS.")
    print("  - Explanation: In a GTO equilibrium, your opponent's strategy is perfectly balanced. Their reaction to your bet (fold, call, or raise) is also part of a GTO strategy and does not 'leak' exploitable information. Your decision to bet is already based on the expected value (EV) calculated against their perfectly balanced response ranges. You aren't betting to 'find out' what they have; you're betting because it's the most profitable action for your range, period.\n")

    # Analysis of Reason 5
    print(f"Reason {5}: '{reasons[5]}'")
    print("  - GTO Verdict: This reason DISAPPEARS.")
    print("  - Explanation: A GTO strategy is concerned with maximizing the profitability of an entire range of hands over the long term, not with concealing the outcome of a single hand. Your opponent, also playing GTO, already knows the exact strategy (i.e., the range of hands and frequencies) you are using. Seeing one specific hand you show down provides no new information to a GTO player that could be used for future exploitation, as they will continue to play their unexploitable strategy regardless.\n")
