# The legal principle of vicarious liability holds an employer responsible for the negligent acts of an employee
# if those acts are committed within the scope of their employment.

# Analysis of Mark's Incident:
# 1. Mark was negligent in operating the lawnmower.
# 2. Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. is vicariously liable for Mark's negligence.
# 3. Therefore, Evergreen and Mark are jointly and severally liable for the pool-related damages.
# 4. The neighbour's liability is too remote to be legally causative.

# Analysis of Lincoln's Incident:
# 1. Lincoln was negligent in using the blower near the car with rocks present.
# 2. Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. is also vicariously liable for Lincoln's negligence.
# 3. Therefore, Evergreen and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable for the damage to the car.
# 4. The fact that the damage was "minimal" does not eliminate liability.

# Conclusion:
# Option E accurately describes the liability for both separate incidents.
