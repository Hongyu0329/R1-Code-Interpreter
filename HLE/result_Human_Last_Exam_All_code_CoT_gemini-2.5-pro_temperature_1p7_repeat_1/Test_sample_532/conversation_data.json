    "Based on a synthesis of modern results in group theory, the classification of finite filled nilpotent groups can be determined by analyzing their component Sylow p-subgroups. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and a Python script to apply the classification.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  A finite group is **nilpotent** if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. For a nilpotent group `G` with order `n = p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_k^{a_k}`, we can write `G ≅ P_1 × P_2 × ... × P_k`, where `P_i` is the unique Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G`.\n\n2.  A crucial theorem states that such a direct product `G` (with factors of coprime order) is a **filled group** if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroup factors `P_i` is a filled group. This simplifies the problem to classifying which `p`-groups are filled.\n\n3.  A finite `p`-group `P` is filled if and only if its Frattini quotient, `P/Φ(P)`, is a filled group. The Frattini quotient of a `p`-group is always an elementary abelian `p`-group, which is a group of the form `(C_p)^d` (the direct product of `d` copies of the cyclic group of order `p`). The integer `d` is the minimum number of generators for `P`.\n\n4.  An elementary abelian `p`-group `V = (C_p)^d` is filled if and only if the pair `(p, d)` is **not** one of the following seven exceptions:\n    `(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 2), (7, 2)`\n\n5.  Therefore, to determine if a finite nilpotent group is filled, we must find the number of generators `d` for each of its Sylow `p`-subgroups `P` and check if any pair `(p, d)` falls into the exception list.\n\nThe following Python code implements this check. For a given nilpotent group, you need to provide the list of pairs `(p, d)` for each of its Sylow subgroups.\n\n```python\ndef check_filled_nilpotent(group_name, sylow_subgroup_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a finite nilpotent group is filled based on its Sylow subgroups.\n\n    Args:\n        group_name (str): The name of the group for display purposes.\n        sylow_subgroup_data (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple is\n                                    (p, d) for a Sylow p-subgroup.\n                                    p is the prime.\n                                    d is the minimum number of generators for that subgroup.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Checking group: {group_name}\")\n    \n    # The set of pairs (p, d) for which the elementary abelian group (C_p)^d is NOT filled.\n    # d is the minimum number of generators for the Sylow p-subgroup.\n    exceptional_pairs = {\n        (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), \n        (3, 2), (3, 3), \n        (5, 2), \n        (7, 2)\n    }\n\n    is_filled = True\n    for p, d in sylow_subgroup_data:\n        pair = (p, d)\n        if pair in exceptional_pairs:\n            print(f\"  - Sylow {p}-subgroup has p={p}, d={d}.
