    "This is a knowledge-based question about classical ballet terminology. I will structure my knowledge into a Python program to find the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a data structure (a dictionary) to represent the given ballet steps and their properties.\n2.  For each step, I will store a boolean value indicating whether its standard execution finishes in the same leg position it started in.\n    *   **Entrechat six:** An even-numbered entrechat lands in the same *type* of position (e.g., fifth), but the front and back feet are swapped (`changé`). So, the end position is not identical to the start.\n    *   **Échappé battu changé:** The term `changé` explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating the feet are swapped upon returning to the closed position.\n    *   **Assemblé:** While some variations exist, the most common forms (`dessus`, `dessous`) change which foot is in front.\n    *   **Glissade derrière:** A standard `glissade` is a linking and traveling step that changes the feet.\n    *   **Gargouillade:** This is a decorative jump where the dancer starts in a position (e.g., fifth), performs a double `rond de jambe` in the air, and lands back in the *exact same* starting position.\n3.  The program will then iterate through this data and print the step that meets the condition.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Entrechat six', 'ends_same_as_starts': False, 'reason': 'Lands with the feet exchanged (changé).'},\n        'B': {'name': 'Échappé battu changé', 'ends_same_as_starts': False, 'reason': 'The name \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed\".'},\n        'C': {'name': 'Assemblé', 'ends_same_as_starts': False, 'reason': 'The most common forms (dessus, dessous) change which foot is in front.'},\n        'D': {'name': 'Glissade derrière', 'ends_same_as_starts': False, 'reason': 'A standard glissade is a traveling step that changes the feet.'},\n        'E': {'name': 'Gargouillade', 'ends_same_as_starts': True, 'reason': 'By definition, this step ends in the identical position from which it began.'}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing which ballet step has the same starting and ending position:\\n\")\n    correct_answer = None\n    correct_key = None\n\n    for key, step_info in ballet_steps.items():\n        if step_info['ends_same_as_starts']:\n            correct_answer = step_info['name']\n            correct_key = key\n            print(f\"- {key}. {step_info['name']}: Correct. {step_info['reason']}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"- {key}. {step_info['name']}: Incorrect. {step_info['reason']}\")\n            \n    if correct_answer:\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: The step that ends in the same position it starts is '{correct_answer}'.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: No step fitting the criteria was found in the list.\")\n\nfind_ballet_step()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
