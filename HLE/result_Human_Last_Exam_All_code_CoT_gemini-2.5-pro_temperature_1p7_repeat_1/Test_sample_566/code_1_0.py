    print("The final signal, \u03C9_as = \u03C9_p + \u03A9_vib, is a spectrum where each frequency corresponds to a unique vibrational mode. Because \u03C9_p is a fixed value, the spectral shape of the \u03C9_as signal directly maps the vibrational spectrum of the sample. This gives distinguishable information.")

The anti-Stokes spectrum for one vibration is essentially a copy of the broadband pump spectrum, shifted by \u03A9_vib.")
