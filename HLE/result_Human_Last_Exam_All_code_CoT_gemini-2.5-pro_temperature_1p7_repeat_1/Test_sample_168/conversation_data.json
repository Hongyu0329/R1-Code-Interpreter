    "This task requires identifying which animal from the given list has a hearing range that includes the very low-frequency sounds produced by human muscle contractions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the approximate hearing frequency ranges for each animal listed in the options (Human, Dog, Bat, Whale, Herring).\n2.  Identify the frequency range of sounds produced by human muscle twitches (mechanomyography).\n3.  Write a Python script to compare the muscle twitch frequency with each animal's hearing range.\n4.  The script will print the analysis for each animal and conclude which one is the most likely to be able to hear the sound. The herring is known for its specialized auditory system that connects its swim bladder to its inner ear, making it exceptionally sensitive to low-frequency sounds and pressure waves, such as those from a predator's moving muscles.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the hearing ranges of different animals to determine which\n    might be able to hear a human muscle twitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the data\n    # Hearing ranges in Hertz (Hz).
