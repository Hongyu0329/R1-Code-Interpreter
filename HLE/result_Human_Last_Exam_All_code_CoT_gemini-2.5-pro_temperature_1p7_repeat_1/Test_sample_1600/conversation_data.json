    "To find the value of `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n`, we need to use the appropriate mathematical formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The number of these Feynman diagrams, `a(n)`, is given by the double factorial of `(2n - 1)`. The formula is `a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`.\n2.  **Apply for n=3:** We need to calculate `a(3)`. Substituting `n=3` into the formula gives `a(3) = (2*3 - 1)!! = (6 - 1)!! = 5!!`.\n3.  **Calculate the Double Factorial:** The double factorial `k!!` is the product of all integers from `k` down to 1 that have the same parity (odd or even) as `k`. For `5!!`, this is `5 * 3 * 1`.\n4.  **Compute the Result:** `5 * 3 * 1 = 15`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_feynman_diagrams(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), which is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\n    The formula is a(n) = (2n - 1)!!.\n\n    This function prints the step-by-step calculation and returns the final value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The value for which to calculate the double factorial\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n\n    # Calculate the double factorial and create the equation string\n    result = 1\n    equation_terms = []\n    \n    # Iterate from k down to 1 with a step of -2\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n        equation_terms.append(str(i))\n    \n    # Join the terms with ' * ' for the final output\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(equation_terms)\n    \n    # Print the full calculation process\n    print(f\"For n = {n}:\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = (2 * {n} - 1)!! = {k}!!\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {k}!! = {equation_str} = {result}\")\n\n# The specific case requested is for a(3)\ncalculate_feynman_diagrams(3)\n```\n<<<15>>>"
