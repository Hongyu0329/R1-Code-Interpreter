    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will first analyze the properties of the chromatic number ($\\chi$) of a graph. The chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring. The question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph ($K_n$).\n2.  I will establish an upper bound for $\\chi(G)$. A key property is that for a graph with $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. Since $G$ is explicitly stated not to be a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than $n$.\n3.  Next, I will prove that this upper bound is achievable. I will construct an example of a graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete but requires exactly $n-1$ colors. A simple construction is a graph consisting of two disconnected components: a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that explains this logic and calculates the result for $n=12345$. The script will print the step-by-step reasoning and the final equation with the numbers involved, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximum number of colors needed to properly\n    color a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    It explains the reasoning and prints the final calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    print(\"The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph G with n = 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"This quantity is the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted as chi(G), for any such graph.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the upper bound for the number of colors.\")\n    print(f\"A graph with n = {num_vertices} vertices has a chromatic number chi(G) = {num_vertices} if and only if it is the complete graph K_n.\")\n    print(f\"The problem states that G is not the complete graph.
