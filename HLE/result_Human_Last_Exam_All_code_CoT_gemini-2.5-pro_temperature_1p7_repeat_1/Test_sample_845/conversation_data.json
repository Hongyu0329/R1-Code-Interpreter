    "The value computed between heartbeats, which is the fundamental measurement used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV), is the time duration between those consecutive beats. This value is most commonly referred to as the \"inter-beat interval\" or IBI. When using an electrocardiogram (ECG), it is specifically called the \"R-R interval.\"\n\nHere is a simple Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_value_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n    \"\"\"\n    # HRV is the measure of the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats.\n    # This time duration is the fundamental value.\n    value_name = \"inter-beat interval (IBI)\"\n    \n    print(f\"The value computed between heartbeats to track HRV is called the: {value_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"
