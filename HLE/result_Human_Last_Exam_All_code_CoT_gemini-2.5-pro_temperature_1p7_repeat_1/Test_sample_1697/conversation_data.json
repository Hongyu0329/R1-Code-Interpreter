    "Here is my plan to determine the reaction product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents:** The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. The reaction involves two steps. The first step uses sec-BuLi and TMEDA, a classic combination for directed ortho-metalation (DoM). The second step uses methyl iodide as an electrophile.\n2.  **Determine the Outcome of the First Step (Directed Ortho-Metalation):** The starting molecule has two powerful directing groups for the lithiation reaction: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino (-NMe₂) at position 3.\n    *   The -CONEt₂ group directs the base to its ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n    *   The -NMe₂ group directs the base to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n    *   Since both groups direct to the C2 position, this site is cooperatively activated, making it the most acidic proton on the ring. The strong base, sec-BuLi, will deprotonate this C2 position, which is then replaced by lithium, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n3.  **Determine the Outcome of the Second Step (Electrophilic Quench):** The aryllithium species formed is a powerful nucleophile. It will react with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:** This reaction sequence results in the addition of a methyl group at the C2 position of the original molecule. Therefore, the final product is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n5.  **Develop the Python Script:** The script will print a step-by-step explanation of the chemical reasoning to arrive at the final product, and then it will print the name of the final product, which includes the required numbers (2 and 3) in its chemical name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step chemical synthesis to find the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Chemical Reaction Analysis:\")\n    print(\"===========================\")\n    print(\"Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\")\n    print(\"Reagents: 1) sec-BuLi, TMEDA in THF; 2) Methyl iodide (CH3I)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The combination of sec-BuLi (a very strong base) and TMEDA is used for directed ortho-metalation.\")\n    print(\"This process removes a proton (H+) from the position 'ortho' (adjacent) to a directing group on a benzene ring and replaces it with lithium (Li+).\")\n    print(\"Our starting material has two powerful directing groups:\")\n    print(\"  - The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group [-CON(Et)2] at position 1.\")\n    print(\"  - The dimethylamino group [-N(Me)2] at position 3.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Determining the site of lithiation:\")\n    print(\"  - The -CON(Et)2 group directs lithiation to positions 2 and 6.\")\n    print(\"  - The -N(Me)2 group directs lithiation to positions 2 and 4.\")\n    print(\"Both groups direct to position 2.
