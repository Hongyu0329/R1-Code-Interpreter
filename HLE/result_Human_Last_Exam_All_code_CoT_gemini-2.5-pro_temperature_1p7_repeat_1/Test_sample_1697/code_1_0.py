    print("---------------------------------------")
    print("The combination of sec-BuLi (a very strong base) and TMEDA is used for directed ortho-metalation.")
    print("This process removes a proton (H+) from the position 'ortho' (adjacent) to a directing group on a benzene ring and replaces it with lithium (Li+).")
    print("Our starting material has two powerful directing groups:")
    print("  - The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group [-CON(Et)2] at position 1.")
    print("  - The dimethylamino group [-N(Me)2] at position 3.\n")

    print("Determining the site of lithiation:")
    print("  - The -CON(Et)2 group directs lithiation to positions 2 and 6.")
    print("  - The -N(Me)2 group directs lithiation to positions 2 and 4.")
    print("Both groups direct to position 2. This cooperative effect makes the proton at position 2 the most acidic, so lithiation occurs here to form an aryllithium intermediate.\n")

    print("Step 2: Electrophilic Quench with Methyl Iodide")
    print("------------------------------------------------")
    print("The aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile.")
    print("When methyl iodide (CH3I) is added, the nucleophilic carbon at position 2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group.")
    print("This attaches a methyl group (-CH3) to position 2 of the benzene ring.\n")
