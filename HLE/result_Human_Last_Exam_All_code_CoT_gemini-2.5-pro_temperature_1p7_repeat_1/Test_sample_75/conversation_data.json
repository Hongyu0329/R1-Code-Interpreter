    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n\n1.  **Establish the Start Date:** The Second Great War began with the events of the Brood War expansion, which started in the year 2500.\n2.  **Establish the End Date:** The war concluded with the defeat of the main antagonist, Amon, at the end of the *Legacy of the Void* expansion, which took place in the year 2506.\n3.  **Calculate the Duration:** Subtract the start year from the end year.\n4.  **Round Up:** As the result is an integer, rounding it up will not change the value.\n5.  **Format the Output:** Display the start year, end year, the calculation, and the final duration in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore began with the Brood War in the year 2500.\nstart_year = 2500\n\n# The war concluded with the end of the conflict against Amon in Legacy of the Void in the year 2506.\nend_year = 2506\n\n# Calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year.\n# The result is rounded up as requested, although it's a whole number here.\nduration = math.ceil(end_year - start_year)\n\n# Print the final result including the equation used for the calculation.\nprint(\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore is generally considered to have started in the year 2500 and ended in 2506.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation for the total duration is: {end_year} - {start_year} = {int(duration)}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the war lasted for {int(duration)} years.\")\n\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
