# Define the radius of the circle
R = 500

# The problem states the circle is not tangent to any grid lines.
# This means the center (cx, cy) cannot have integer coordinates, as R is an integer.
# Let the center be (cx, cy), where cx = I_x + f_x and cy = I_y + f_y,
# with I_x, I_y being integers and f_x, f_y in (0, 1).

# Number of vertical grid lines crossed (Nv_lines)
# Nv_lines = floor(cx + R) - floor(cx - R)
# Let's substitute cx = I_x + f_x and use the property floor(z + int) = floor(z) + int
# Nv_lines = floor(I_x + f_x + R) - floor(I_x + f_x - R)
# Nv_lines = (I_x + R + floor(f_x)) - (I_x + floor(f_x - R))
# Since 0 < f_x < 1, floor(f_x) = 0.
# Since 0 < f_x < 1, -R < f_x - R < 1-R. For R=500, -500 < f_x - 500 < -499.
# Thus, floor(f_x - R) = -R.
# Nv_lines = (I_x + R + 0) - (I_x - R) = 2 * R
Nv_lines = 2 * R

# Similarly, for horizontal lines:
Nh_lines = 2 * R

# The total number of crossings (n_c) is 2 for each line crossed (non-tangency).
# The problem also states the circle does not pass through any grid intersections.
# For a simple closed convex curve under these conditions, the number of cells
# crossed (N) is equal to the total number of line crossings.
# N = n_c = 2 * Nv_lines + 2 * Nh_lines
N = 2 * Nv_lines + 2 * Nh_lines
# Substituting Nv_lines and Nh_lines:
# N = 2 * (2*R) + 2 * (2*R) = 8*R
calculated_N = 8 * R

# Since this result does not depend on the specific fractional parts (f_x, f_y) of the
# center's coordinates (as long as they are not 0), the number of crossed
# cells is constant.
min_N = calculated_N
max_N = calculated_N
