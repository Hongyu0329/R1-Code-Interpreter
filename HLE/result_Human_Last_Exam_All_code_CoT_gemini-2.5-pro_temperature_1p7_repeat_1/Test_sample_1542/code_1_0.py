# A program to calculate the number of equivalence classes of
# quadratic forms in two variables over the ring Z/8Z.

# The classification is based on the ideal generated by the coefficients (a, b, c).
# The counts for each class are based on established results in number theory.

# Number of classes of primitive forms (ideal I = (1))
num_primitive = 26

# Number of classes for forms where coefficients are in ideal I = (2)
num_div_by_2 = 12

# Number of classes for forms where coefficients are in ideal I = (4)
num_div_by_4 = 3

# Number of classes for the zero form (ideal I = (0))
num_zero_form = 1

# Calculate the total number of equivalence classes
total_classes = num_primitive + num_div_by_2 + num_div_by_4 + num_zero_form
