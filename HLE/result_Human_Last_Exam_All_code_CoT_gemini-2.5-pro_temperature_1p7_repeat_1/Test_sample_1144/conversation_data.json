    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** First, we'll use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to find the uncertainty in the electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$). The principle is given by $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. We will use the minimum uncertainty condition, giving us $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}$.\n2.  **Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit:** Next, we'll calculate the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit. According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. For the first orbit, n=1, so $mvr = \\hbar$. Since linear momentum is $p=mv$, we can write this as $p \\cdot r = \\hbar$. The radius ($r$) of the first Bohr orbit is the Bohr radius, $a_0$. Therefore, the momentum is $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$.\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Finally, we will compute the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum, which is $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$. Substituting the expressions from the previous steps, the ratio simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar / (2 \\cdot \\Delta x)}{\\hbar / a_0} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}$.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will now implement a Python script to perform these calculations and display the final equation with all the numerical values.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# Given uncertainty in position in meters\ndelta_x = 10e-12  # 10 pm\n\n# Physical constants from scipy library\n# hbar: reduced Planck constant\n# a0: Bohr radius\nhbar = const.hbar\nbohr_radius = const.value('Bohr radius')\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p)\n# p = hbar / a0 (where a0 is the radius of the first Bohr orbit)\np = hbar / bohr_radius\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of delta_p to p\nratio = delta_p / p\n\n# Also can be calculated directly as: ratio = bohr_radius / (2 * delta_x)\n# This serves as a good check.\n\nprint(f\"Uncertainty in position (Δx) = {delta_x:.2e} m\")\nprint(f\"Bohr radius (a₀) = {bohr_radius:.2e} m\")\nprint(f\"Reduced Planck constant (ħ) = {hbar:.2e} J·s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Uncertainty in momentum (Δp = ħ / (2·Δx)) = {delta_p:.4e} kg·m/s\")\nprint(f\"Momentum in first Bohr orbit (p = ħ / a₀) = {p:.4e} kg·m/s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"The final equation is the ratio of these two values:\")\nprint(f\"{delta_p} / {p} = {ratio}\")\n```\n<<<2.645886054942129>>>"
