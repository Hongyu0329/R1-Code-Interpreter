    "This is a conceptual question in genetics. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability ($h^2_{SNP}$):** SNP heritability is a population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a trait (phenotype) that is explained by the additive effects of *all* single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in a given study (e.g., all SNPs on a genotyping chip). It is the theoretical maximum variance that could be explained if we knew the true effect size of every single SNP. It is an estimate of a ceiling.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability ($R^2_{PGS}$):** A polygenic score is a tool for *prediction* in individuals. It's created by taking SNP data from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The effect sizes (weights) for each SNP are estimated from this \"discovery\" GWAS. The PGS for a new person (in a \"target\" sample) is calculated by summing up their alleles, weighted by the effect sizes from the GWAS. The predictive ability, typically measured by $R^2$, is the proportion of variance in the trait that this calculated score can explain in the *target* sample.\n\n3.  **Compare the two:**\n    *   The SNP heritability ($h^2_{SNP}$) is the theoretical \"signal\"â€”the total variance explainable by the SNPs.\n    *   The PGS is an *attempt to capture* that signal.\n    *   However, the PGS is built using *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS with a finite sample size. These estimates are not perfect; they contain statistical noise and are subject to biases like \"winner's curse\".\n    *   Because the weights used to build the PGS are imperfect estimates of the true effects, the resulting score will inevitably capture only a fraction of the total signal. Its predictive power ($R^2_{PGS}$) in a new sample will therefore be lower than the total variance available to be explained ($h^2_{SNP}$).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The predictive ability of a PGS is fundamentally limited by the SNP heritability. In any realistic scenario, it will be lower because the information used to build the score (the GWAS summary statistics) is incomplete and noisy. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this concept using hypothetical, but realistic, values. It assigns a value to SNP heritability and a lower value to the variance explained by a PGS, then prints a statement clarifying their relationship.\n\n```python\n# Define hypothetical values for SNP heritability and PGS predictive ability\n# SNP heritability (h2_snp) represents the total phenotypic variance\n# explained by all considered SNPs. It's a theoretical maximum.\n# Let's assume for a given trait, it's 50%.\nh2_snp = 0.50\n\n# The predictive ability of a Polygenic Score (PGS R-squared) is the variance\n# explained by a predictive model built from GWAS data. Due to finite sample\n# sizes in the GWAS, imperfect model assumptions, and other statistical noise,\n# the PGS can only capture a fraction of the total SNP heritability.\n# A realistic value for a well-powered PGS might be 10-15%.\npgs_r_squared = 0.12\n\n# The core concept is that pgs_r_squared <= h2_snp.\n# We can print this relationship.\nprint(f\"The SNP heritability (h2_snp) for a trait is the theoretical maximum proportion of variance explainable by SNPs.\")\nprint(f\"A hypothetical h2_snp is: {h2_snp}\")\nprint(\"\\nA Polygenic Score (PGS) is a predictive model based on GWAS data. Its predictive ability (R-squared) is the actual variance it explains in a new sample.\")\nprint(f\"A realistic R-squared for the PGS might be: {pgs_r_squared}\")\nprint(f\"\\nAs such, the PGS predictive ability of {pgs_r_squared} is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability of {h2_snp} because the PGS is an imperfect model trying to capture that total heritable signal.\")\n\n```\n<<<True>>>"
