    Analyzes the provided statements about attack graphs and identifies the incorrect one.

    A. Both the worst-case time complexity required to generate both SEG and LAG is exponential time. (Correct)
    B. There are attack paths that can be represented by SEG but not by LAG. (Correct, e.g., non-monotonic paths)
    C. The reason why the size of LAG is overwhelmingly smaller than that of SEG is the monotonicity employed in LAG. (Correct, monotonicity enables the abstraction)
    D. Neither SEG nor LAG can calculate the probability of an event occurrence tied to a node if there is a loop structure in the graph. (Incorrect, advanced methods exist)
    E. In general, LAG cannot handle negation operations except when applied to initial conditions, but SEG can. (Correct)

    The only incorrect statement is D.
