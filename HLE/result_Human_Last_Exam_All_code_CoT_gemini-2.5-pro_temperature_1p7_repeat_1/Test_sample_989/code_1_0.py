    # --- Analysis of Statement A ---
    print("--- Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class. ---")
    print("This statement is TRUE.")
    print("In the SVM dual formulation, one of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is that the sum of the product of Lagrange multipliers (alpha_i) and class labels (y_i) must be zero:")
    print("Equation: sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0")
    print("Support vectors are the points for which alpha_i > 0. If all support vectors belonged to one class (e.g., y_i = +1), the sum would be sum(alpha_i * 1), which must be positive. This would violate the KKT condition. Therefore, there must be support vectors from both classes.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Statement B ---
    print("--- Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM. ---")
    print("This statement is TRUE.")
    print("Standard SVM seeks a symmetric margin. However, in cases of class imbalance or unequal misclassification costs, we can use a cost-sensitive SVM. This modification assigns different penalty parameters (C_positive, C_negative) to the slack variables for each class. By penalizing errors for the minority or more important class more heavily, the model pushes the decision boundary away from that class, effectively creating an 'unequal' or asymmetric margin to achieve a lower overall misclassification cost.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Statement C ---
    print("--- Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels. ---")
    print("This statement is TRUE.")
    print("This is the essence of the 'kernel trick'. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, K(x, z) = exp(-gamma * ||x - z||^2), implicitly maps data to an infinite-dimensional feature space. However, we never need to compute the coordinates in that space. We only need to compute the kernel function value, which is a simple and fast calculation. This makes training an SVM in an infinite-dimensional space computationally tractable.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Statement D ---
    print("--- Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points. ---")
    print("This statement is TRUE.")
    print("The SVM decision boundary is defined entirely by the support vectors (the points on or inside the margin). Points that are correctly classified and lie outside the margin are called interior points. These points have a corresponding Lagrange multiplier alpha_i = 0 in the dual solution. Since they do not contribute to the calculation of the weight vector 'w' or the bias 'b', they can be moved or more can be added without changing the decision boundary, as long as they don't cross the margin and become support vectors.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Statement E ---
    print("--- Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer. ---")
    print("This statement is FALSE.")
    print("While a strictly convex function will have at most one global minimizer (uniqueness), it is not guaranteed to have one. The existence of a minimizer depends on the function's domain and behavior.")
    print("A simple counterexample is the function f(x) = e^x. This function is strictly convex on the set of all real numbers.")
    print("However, it has no minimum value. Its value approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity, but it never reaches 0. Therefore, it does not have a global minimizer. For a minimizer to be guaranteed, additional conditions are needed, such as the function being defined on a compact (closed and bounded) set.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("---------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: The statement that is not true is E.")
