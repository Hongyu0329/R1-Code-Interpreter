    "Of course, I can help you solve this geometrical problem with a Python script. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Geometry**: The problem describes two cubes of side length 1. One is shifted relative to the other. I will set up a coordinate system to define the positions of these two cubes. A natural choice is to place the center of the first cube at the origin (0, 0, 0).\n2.  **Define the Shift**: The shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n    *   The main diagonal of the cube corresponds to the direction vector (1, 1, 1).\n    *   The length of this shift is 1/2.\n    *   Therefore, the shift vector `d` is calculated by taking the direction vector, normalizing it (dividing by its length, which is sqrt(3)), and then scaling it by 1/2. This results in a shift vector `d = (s, s, s)` where `s = (1/2) / sqrt(3)`.\n3.  **Find the Intersection**: With the first cube at `[-0.5, 0.5]^3` and the second at `[s-0.5, s+0.5]^3`, their intersection will be a new, smaller cube. I will determine the side length of this intersection cube by finding the overlap in the coordinate ranges.\n4.  **Calculate the Volume**: The volume of the intersection is simply the side length of this smaller cube raised to the power of 3.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the final equation with the resulting volume.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the volume:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_intersection_volume():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two cubes shifted along the main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Side length of the original cubes.\n    L_cube = 1.0\n\n    # The shift distance is 1/2.\n    shift_distance = 0.5\n\n    # The shift is along the main diagonal, whose direction vector is (1, 1, 1).\n    # The length of this direction vector is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3).\n    # To find the shift component 's' along each axis, we divide the shift distance\n    # by the length of the diagonal vector.\n    s = shift_distance / math.sqrt(3)\n\n    # We can model the first cube as being centered at the origin, so it occupies the space\n    # [-0.5, 0.5] on each axis. The second cube is shifted by (s, s, s).\n    # The intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube whose side length is given by:\n    # L_intersect = L_cube - s\n    L_intersect = L_cube - s\n\n    # The volume of this intersection cube is its side length cubed.\n    volume = L_intersect**3\n\n    print(\"The volume of the intersection is calculated as (L_cube - s)^3.\")\n    print(\"Where L_cube = 1.0 (the side length of the cubes)\")\n    print(f\"And s = {shift_distance} / sqrt(3) = {s}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation with the calculated values is:\")\n    print(f\"({L_cube} - {s}) ** 3 = {volume}\")\n\nsolve_intersection_volume()\n```\n<<<0.3598979485603816>>>"
