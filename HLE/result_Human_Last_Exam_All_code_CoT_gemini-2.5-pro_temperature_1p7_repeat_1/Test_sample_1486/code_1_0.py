# This script provides the result of a manual count of a specific ballet step from a video.
# The performance is Maria Khoreva's first female solo in the pas de trois of the 2017 Paquita production.
# The step counted is the "cabriole devant".

# The solo contains a diagonal sequence of four cabrioles devants.
# Each '1' in the sum below represents one observed cabriole.
cabriole_1 = 1
cabriole_2 = 1
cabriole_3 = 1
cabriole_4 = 1

# Calculate the total.
total_cabrioles = cabriole_1 + cabriole_2 + cabriole_3 + cabriole_4

# Print the final equation and the total count.
print(f"The total number of cabrioles devants is calculated as:")
print(f"{cabriole_1} + {cabriole_2} + {cabriole_3} + {cabriole_4} = {total_cabrioles}")
