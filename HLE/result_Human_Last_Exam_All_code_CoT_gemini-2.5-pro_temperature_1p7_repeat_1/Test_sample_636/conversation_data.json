    "To solve this problem, we will determine the state feedback gain matrix `F` that places the eigenvalues (also known as poles) of the closed-loop system `A + BF` at the desired locations, `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define System and Goal:** The system is described by matrices `A` and `B`. We need to find a 2x2 matrix `F` such that `A_cl = A + BF` has the specified eigenvalues.\n2.  **Characteristic Equation:** The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation, `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`. We will derive this equation for `A_cl`.\n3.  **Desired Polynomial:** From the desired eigenvalues `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`, the target characteristic polynomial is `(λ - p1)(λ - p2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n4.  **Degrees of Freedom:** Since this is a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system with two states and two inputs, there are more control variables than states to control. This means there are infinite possible solutions for the matrix `F`. We can find one solution by simplifying the problem. A common approach is to assume one of the control inputs is unused. We will set the second control input `u2` to zero, which means the second row of `F` will be all zeros. So, `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`.\n5.  **Solve for F:** By substituting this simplified `F` into the characteristic equation for `A + BF` and equating its coefficients with the desired polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2`, we will get a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, `f1` and `f2`.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will perform the following:\n    *   Define the matrices `A` and `B`.\n    *   Solve the system of linear equations for `f1` and `f2` derived from the coefficient matching.\n    *   Construct the final gain matrix `F`.\n    *   Print the components of the final equation `A + B*F`.\n    *   Verify the solution by calculating the eigenvalues of the resulting `A + BF` matrix to confirm they are at the desired locations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates a state feedback gain F to place the poles of A + B*F.\n#\n# The characteristic equation for the simplified closed-loop system A_cl = A + B*F,\n# with F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]], is derived as follows:\n#\n# B*F = [[1, 2],   *  [[f1, f2],  =  [[f1, f2],\n#        [1, 0]]      [0, 0]]       [f1, f2]]\n#\n# A_cl = A + B*F = [[-1, 1], + [[f1, f2], = [[f1 - 1, f2 + 1],\n#                    [ 1, 0]]   [f1, f2]]   [f1 + 1,      f2]]\n#\n# The characteristic polynomial is det(λI - A_cl):\n# |λ - (f1-1)   -(f2+1) |\n# |-(f1+1)     λ - f2   |  = (λ - f1 + 1)(λ - f2) - (f1 + 1)(f2 + 1)\n#                          = λ^2 + λ*(1 - f1 - f2) - (1 + f1 + 2*f2)\n#\n# The desired polynomial from eigenvalues -1 ± j is λ^2 + 2λ + 2.\n#\n# Equating coefficients:\n# λ^1: 1 - f1 - f2 = 2        => f1 + f2 = -1\n# λ^0: -(1 + f1 + 2*f2) = 2    => f1 + 2*f2 = -3\n#\n# We solve this 2x2 system for f1 and f2.\n# Let C be the coefficient matrix and d be the constant vector.\n# [[1, 1], [1, 2]] * [[f1], [f2]] = [[-1], [-3]]\nC = np.array([[1., 1.], [1., 2.]])\nd = np.array([-1., -3.])\n\n# Solve for f = [f1, f2]\nf_params = np.linalg.solve(C, d)\nf1 = f_params[0]\nf2 = f_params[1]\n\n# Construct the full gain matrix F\nF = np.array([[f1, f2],\n              [0., 0.]])\n\n# Define system matrices for verification\nA = np.array([[-1., 1.],\n              [1., 0.]])\nB = np.array([[1., 2.],\n              [1., 0.]])\n\n# Calculate the closed-loop system matrix A_cl = A + B*F\nA_cl = A + B @ F\n\n# Verify the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system\neigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n\nprint(\"This script finds one possible gain matrix F by assuming the second control input is not used (f3=f4=0).\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The state matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nThe input matrix B is:\")\nprint(B)\nprint(\"\\nThe desired eigenvalues are: -1 + 1j and -1 - 1j\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The calculated state feedback gain F is:\")\nprint(F)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation for the closed-loop matrix is A_cl = A + B*F.\")\nprint(f\"\\n{A}\\n\\n+\\n\\n{B}\\n\\n*\\n\\n{F}\\n\\n=\\n\\n{A_cl}\\n\")\n\n\nprint(\"\\nTo verify, the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix A_cl are:\")\n# Using np.round to clean up display of floating point numbers\nprint(np.round(eigenvalues, decimals=5))\n```\n<<<[[ 1., -2.], [ 0.,  0.]]>>>"
