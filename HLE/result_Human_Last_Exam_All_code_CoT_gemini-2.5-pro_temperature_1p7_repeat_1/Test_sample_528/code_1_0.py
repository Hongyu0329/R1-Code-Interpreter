# Each element from the universe {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} must be placed into
# one of the 5 disjoint regions that define the chain of subsets:
# S1, S2\S1, S3\S2, S4\S3, U\S4 (where U={1,2,3,4,5})
# We find the number of valid choices for each element based on the given constraints.

# Constraint for element 1: 1 in S1
# This means 1 must be in the region S1.
# Number of choices for element 1:
c1 = 1

# Constraint for element 2: 2 in S2
# This means 2 can be in S1 or S2\S1.
# Number of choices for element 2:
c2 = 2

# Constraint for element 3: 3 in S3
# This means 3 can be in S1, S2\S1, or S3\S2.
# Number of choices for element 3:
c3 = 3

# No constraint for element 4. It can be in any of the 5 regions.
# Number of choices for element 4:
c4 = 5

# No constraint for element 5. It can be in any of the 5 regions.
# Number of choices for element 5:
c5 = 5

# The total number of ways is the product of the number of choices for each element.
