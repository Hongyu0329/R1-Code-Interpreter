    print("Step 1: The songs 'Venus in Furs,' 'Sister Ray,' and 'Lady Godiva\'s Operation' are all by the band The Velvet Underground.")
    print("\nStep 2: The principal songwriter of The Velvet Underground was Lou Reed. His most significant early collaborator was John Cale. The themes of the songs are associated with their work under the patronage of Andy Warhol.")
    print("\nStep 3: The riddle points to a collaborative project between these figures. Lou Reed and John Cale famously reunited after years of estrangement to create a tribute album for Andy Warhol after his death.")
    print("\nStep 4: This project is the 1990 album 'Songs for Drella.' 'Drella' was Andy Warhol's nickname. The album fits all the clues: it's a project by the key figures from The Velvet Underground, and its themes are directly related to the world that inspired their early music.")
    print("\nStep 5: Based on this reasoning, 'Songs for Drella' is the correct project.")
