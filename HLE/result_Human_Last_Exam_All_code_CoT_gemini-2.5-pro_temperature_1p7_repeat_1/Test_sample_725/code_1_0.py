# The user is asking about the relationship between orbital overlap and covalency.
# In chemical bonding, covalency is the degree of electron sharing between atoms,
# which is facilitated by the overlap of their atomic orbitals.

# A fundamental principle of molecular orbital theory is that greater orbital
# overlap leads to a stronger interaction and a more covalent bond.

# The problem provides the key piece of information:
# Overlap in CeF6(2-) is greater than the overlap in CeCl6(2-).

# Therefore, we can directly conclude the relationship for covalency.
# The script will print the logical conclusion based on this premise.
