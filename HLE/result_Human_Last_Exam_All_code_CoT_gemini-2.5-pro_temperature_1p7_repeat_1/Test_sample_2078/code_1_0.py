#    t=0: S1=A
#    t=1: S1=B (so S2(2) = Y)

#    S2(2) is determined by S1(1), which must be B. So S2(2) = Y.
#    The probability of S3 becoming N given S2 was Y is:
p_N_given_Y = P_S3_from_S2['Y']['N']

# 3. The total probability is the product of these independent probabilities.
# The intermediate states of S3 do not affect the final outcome probability because
# we sum over all possibilities, and their probabilities sum to 1 at each step.
