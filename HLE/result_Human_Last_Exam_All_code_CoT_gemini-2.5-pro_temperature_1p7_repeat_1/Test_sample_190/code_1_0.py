# We analyze the transience or recurrence of the Markov chain by studying its drift.
# A powerful criterion for a random walk on the positive integers is to analyze the
# expected drift of the logarithm of the state, V(k) = log(k). The chain tends
# to be transient if this drift is positive (pushing k towards infinity) and
# recurrent if it is negative (pushing k towards 0).

# For large k, the expected drift E[log(X_{n+1}) - log(X_n) | X_n = k] can be
# approximated using a Taylor expansion:
# Drift(log(k)) â‰ˆ E[j|k]/k - E[j^2|k]/(2*k^2)
# where j = X_{n+1} - k is the jump from state k.

# Step 1: Calculate the first two moments of the jump j.
# The possible jumps and their probabilities P(j) for large k are:
# j = +1, P = 1/4 + c/k
# j = -1, P = 1/4 - c/k
# j = +2, P = 1/4
# j = -2, P = 1/4

print("Step 1: Calculate moments of the jump size (j).")

# First moment E[j|k]
# E[j|k] = (+1)*(1/4 + c/k) + (-1)*(1/4 - c/k) + (+2)*(1/4) + (-2)*(1/4)
#        = 1/4 + c/k - 1/4 + c/k + 2/4 - 2/4
#        = 2*c/k

print(f"The expected jump size E[j|k] = {e_j_numerator_c_coeff}*c/k")

# Second moment E[j^2|k]
# E[j^2|k] = (+1)^2*(1/4 + c/k) + (-1)^2*(1/4 - c/k) + (+2)^2*(1/4) + (-2)^2*(1/4)
#         = 1*(1/4 + c/k) + 1*(1/4 - c/k) + 4*(1/4) + 4*(1/4)
#         = 1/4 + c/k + 1/4 - c/k + 1 + 1
#         = 1/2 + 2 = 5/2
