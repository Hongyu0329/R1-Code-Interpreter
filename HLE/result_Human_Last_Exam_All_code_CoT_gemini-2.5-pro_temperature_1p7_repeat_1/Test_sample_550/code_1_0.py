    This function calculates the dimension of the ninth cohomology group H^9(M, Q).

    The calculation follows from a topological analysis of the space M.
    1. M is homotopy equivalent to its intersection with the sphere S^15 in R^16.
    2. By Alexander Duality, H^9(M) is isomorphic to the reduced 5th homology of a union of great spheres K_v.
    3. The dimension of this homology group is calculated via an inclusion-exclusion principle.
       Each term in the sum is the 5th homology of an intersection of some number, k, of the spheres K_v.
    4. An intersection of k spheres K_v is a sphere of dimension 15 - 4k.
    5. For the 5th homology to be non-zero, the dimension of this sphere must be 5.
    6. We solve the equation 15 - 4k = 5 for integer k >= 1.
