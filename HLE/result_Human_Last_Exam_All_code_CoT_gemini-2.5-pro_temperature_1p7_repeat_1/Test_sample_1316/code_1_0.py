    Explains the genetic event behind Bridges' discovery of exceptional Drosophila.

    explanation = """
1.  **Organism and Karyotype:** In Drosophila, an X0 karyotype (one X chromosome, no Y) results in a sterile male. The phenotype of this male is determined by the alleles on its single X chromosome.

2.  **Formation of an X0 Male:** An X0 individual is formed from the fusion of an X-bearing gamete from one parent and a gamete lacking a sex chromosome (a "nullo" or "0" gamete) from the other parent.

3.  **Deducing the Error's Origin:** The problem states the male offspring's phenotype is "unexpected." This references Bridges' experiments, such as crossing a white-eyed female with a red-eyed male. An unexpected red-eyed male offspring would have inherited its X chromosome from the red-eyed father.
    - Father's contribution: X (carrying red-eye allele)
    - Mother's contribution must be: 0 (the nullo gamete)

4.  **Identifying the Event:** The mother produced a "0" egg because her two X chromosomes failed to separate during meiosis. This event is called non-disjunction. While non-disjunction can occur in Meiosis I or II, the seminal discovery of this phenomenon by Bridges is referred to as "primary non-disjunction," which describes the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate during Meiosis I. This single event in the female explains both the exceptional X0 males and the exceptional XXY females he observed.

5.  **Conclusion:** The observation indicates non-disjunction of the X chromosome during female meiosis I.
