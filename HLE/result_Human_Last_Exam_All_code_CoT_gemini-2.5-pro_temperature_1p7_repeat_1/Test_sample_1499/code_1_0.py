# The task is to find the Old Church Slavonic form for the 3rd person plural imperative of the verb "to be".
# The input contains the phrase "(3rd person singular plural, imperative, command or suggestion)".
# This is interpreted as a typo for "(3rd person plural, imperative)".
# The verb stem for the future and imperative is бѫд-.
# According to Old Church Slavonic grammar, the 3rd person plural imperative form is derived
# from the 3rd person plural future indicative.
# 3rd person plural future: бѫдѫтъ (bǫdǫtŭ)
# 3rd person plural imperative: (да) бѫдѫтъ ((da) bǫdǫtŭ)
# As the list contains single-word forms, the correct completion is the word itself.

correct_form = "бѫдѫтъ"
