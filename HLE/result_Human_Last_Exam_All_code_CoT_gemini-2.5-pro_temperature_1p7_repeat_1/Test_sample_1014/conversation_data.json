    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881.\n\nFirst, I will write a Python script that finds all prime factors of a given number. The strategy is as follows:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  I will handle the smallest prime, 2, separately by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 until it's no longer even and adding 2 to a list of factors for each successful division.\n3.  Next, I'll iterate through odd numbers (`d = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining `n`.\n4.  For each odd number `d`, I'll check if it divides `n`. If it does, I'll add `d` to our list of factors and divide `n` by `d` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible.\n5.  If, after the loop, the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining value is also a prime factor and will be added to the list.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the complete prime factorization equation, find the largest number in the list of factors, and print it as the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the largest prime divisor of a given number,\n    prints the prime factorization, and then prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor 2 if the number is even.\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors. We only need to check up to the square root of the number.\n    # The divisor 'd' is incremented by 2 to check only odd numbers.\n    d = 3\n    while d * d <= n:\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            n = n // d\n        d = d + 2\n\n    # If n is still greater than 2 at this point, the remaining n is a prime factor itself.\n    # This happens if the largest prime factor is greater than the square root of the original number.\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n        \n    # If the factors list is empty, it means the original number itself is prime.\n    if not factors:\n        factors.append(original_n)\n\n    # Print the full prime factorization equation.\n    # The map(str, factors) converts each integer factor to a string.\n    # ' * '.join(...) combines them into a single string with \" * \" as a separator.\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_n} is:\")\n    print(f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\")\n\n    # Find and print the largest prime factor from the list.\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n    else:\n        # This case should not be reached with the current logic, but it is good practice for robustness.\n        print(\"Could not determine the largest prime divisor.\")\n\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
