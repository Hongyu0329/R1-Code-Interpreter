    "To determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we can follow a computational approach based on the fundamental principles of group representation theory.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1.  **Partitions and Irreps:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. An integer partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Hook Length Formula:** The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a given partition $\\lambda$ is calculated using the Hook Length Formula. The formula is:\n    $$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_{ij}(\\lambda)}$$\n    where:\n    *   $Y(\\lambda)$ is the Young diagram corresponding to the partition $\\lambda$.\n    *   $h_{ij}(\\lambda)$ is the hook length of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$ in the diagram. The hook length is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one for the cell itself.\n\n3.  **Computational Plan:**\n    *   Generate all possible integer partitions of 25.\n    *   For each partition, construct its Young diagram and calculate the product of all its hook lengths.\n    *   Use the Hook Length Formula to compute the dimension of the corresponding irrep.\n    *   Count how many of these calculated dimensions are strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe following Python script implements this procedure to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irreducible representation of S_n\n    corresponding to a given partition using the Hook Length Formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sum(partition)\n    \n    # Numerator is n!\n    try:\n        numerator = math.factorial(n)\n    except ValueError:\n        # n=25 is well within the standard limits, but this handles potential large n.\n        return float('inf') \n\n    # Denominator is the product of all hook lengths\n    prod_hook_lengths = 1\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell (i, j) in the Young diagram of the partition\n    for i, row_len in enumerate(partition):\n        for j in range(row_len):\n            # Calculate the hook length for the cell at (row i, column j)\n            # The hook length is 1 (for the cell itself) + arm_length + leg_length.\n            \n            # arm_length: number of cells to the right in the same row\n            arm_length = row_len - (j + 1)\n            \n            # leg_length: number of cells below in the same column\n            leg_length = 0\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                # If the row below is long enough to have a cell in this column\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    leg_length += 1\n            \n            hook_length = arm_length + leg_length + 1\n            prod_hook_lengths *= hook_length\n            \n    # The dimension must be an integer, so we use integer division.\n    if prod_hook_lengths == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    dimension = numerator // prod_hook_lengths\n    \n    return dimension\n\ndef generate_partitions(n, min_part=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    A generator for integer partitions of n.\n    Yields partitions as lists of integers in non-increasing order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        yield []\n        return\n        \n    for i in range(min_part, n + 1):\n        for p in generate_partitions(n - i, i):\n            yield [i] + p\n\ndef solve_s25_irreps_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the number of irreducible representations of the symmetric group S_25\n    that have a dimension strictly less than a specified limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 25\n    dimension_limit = 500000\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Generate all partitions of 25.\n    all_partitions_gen = generate_partitions(n)\n    \n    # Iterate through all partitions.\n    for p in all_partitions_gen:\n        # For each partition, calculate the dimension of the corresponding irrep.\n        dim = calculate_dimension(p)\n        \n        # Check if the dimension is within the specified limit.\n        if dim < dimension_limit:\n            count += 1\n    \n    print(f\"The number of irreducible representations of S_{n} with a dimension strictly less than {dimension_limit} is: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_s25_irreps_count()\n<<<76>>>\n```"
