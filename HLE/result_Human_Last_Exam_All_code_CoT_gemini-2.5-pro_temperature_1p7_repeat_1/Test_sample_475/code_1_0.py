    Calculates the total charge on a spherical droplet based on a simplified model.
    
    This solution assumes a typo in the problem's surface charge density formula.
    The term involving W(exp(q_i * theta * phi)) is replaced by a constant 
    involving omega = W(1), as this resolves multiple issues with the integral
    (intractability, unused constants, and undefined parameters epsilon, n, m).
