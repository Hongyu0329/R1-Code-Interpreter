    "I will scan the provided Latin line. My approach is to determine the length of each syllable based on standard rules of quantity (vowel length) and position (consonant environment). Latin comedy, from which this line is taken, often uses meters with rules that are more flexible than those of classical epic poetry, so the resulting pattern may not fit a perfect, simple meter like Dactylic Hexameter.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will break the line down into its constituent syllables.\n2.  I will handle elision, where a final vowel of one word is dropped or merged before a word beginning with a vowel. In this line, `bene esse` elides to become `ben'esse`.\n3.  For each syllable, I will determine if it is Long (L) or Short (S) based on the rules of Latin prosody.\n    *   A syllable is **Long (L)** if its vowel is naturally long, is a diphthong, or is followed by two or more consonants (making it long \"by position\").\n    *   Otherwise, a syllable is **Short (S)**.\n    *   The final syllable of a line is considered long by convention (*syllaba anceps*).\n4.  Finally, I will present the original line with the corresponding sequence of 'L' and 'S' markings for each syllable, grouping them by the original words.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans a line of Latin, providing the metrical quantity (L/S) for each syllable.\n    This line is from Plautus and follows the rules of dramatic meter, which can be irregular.\n    The output shows the syllable-by-syllable analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    \n    # The analysis of each word/elided pair based on classical rules:\n    # 1. et: Long by position (followed by 't' in 'tibi').\n    # 2. tibi: 'ti' is short, 'bi' is short.\n    # 3. bene esse: elides to 'ben'esse'. Syllables are 'be' (short), 'nes' (long by position before 'ss'), 'se' (short).\n    # 4. soli: Dative sōlī. 'sō' is long by nature, 'lī' is long by nature.\n    # 5. quom: Long by position (followed by 's' in 'sibi').\n    # 6. sibi: 'si' is short, 'bi' is short.\n    # 7. sit: Long by position (followed by 'm' in 'male').\n    # 8. male: 'ma' is short.
