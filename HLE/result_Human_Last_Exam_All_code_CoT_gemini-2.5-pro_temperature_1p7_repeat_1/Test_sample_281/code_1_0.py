    # Step 1-3: The Square Body
    # We define a 3x3 square. Let the bottom-left corner b1 be at the origin (0,0).
    # Ruled lines are at y=0, 1, 2, 3. The square is 3 spaces high.
    b1 = (0, 0)

    print(f"The bottom points are b1 = {b1} and b2 = {b2}.")

    # Step 4-5: The Foundation
    # From b1(0,0), go down to the next ruled line (y=-1) and
    # right 2/3 of the horizontal distance to b2 (2/3 * 3 = 2).
    p_x = b1[0] + 2
    p_y = -1
    p = (p_x, p_y)

    print(f"Another segment connects p {p} to b2 {b2}.")
    # Current shape: A square on a trapezoidal base. Looks like a house on a foundation.

    # Step 6: Center of the Square
    c_x = (b1[0] + top_right[0]) / 2
    c_y = (b1[1] + top_right[1]) / 2
    c = (c_x, c_y)

    # Step 8: The 'q' Square (Window)
    # This step has a major contradiction.
    # "opposite (diagonal) corner q on the same horizontal line as r and the same vertical line as p"
    # This means q_y = r_y = 2 and q_x = p_x = 2. So q = (2,2).
    # Points r=(3,2) and q=(2,2) cannot be diagonal corners as they lie on the same line.

    # Step 9-10: Internal Structure

    # These lines run from the vertical line x=2 to the center at x=1.5, suggesting depth.
    
    # Step 12-13: Final Modification
    # "Let s be the forth corner of the square whose other corners are a1, a2, b2"
    # The corners a1(2,2), a2(2,0), b2(3,0) form a 1x2 rectangle, not a square. Another contradiction.
    # If we assume it means rectangle, the fourth corner 's' would be at (3,2), which is 'r'.
