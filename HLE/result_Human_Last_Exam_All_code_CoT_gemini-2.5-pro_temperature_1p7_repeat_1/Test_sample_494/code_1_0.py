    print("\nStep 1: Understand the physical basis of tunneling in Ammonia (NH3).")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Ammonia has a trigonal pyramidal shape. The Nitrogen atom can quantum-mechanically tunnel through the plane of the three Hydrogen atoms.")
    print("This tunneling splits the ground vibrational state into two distinct, closely spaced energy levels:")
    print("  - A lower energy level with a SYMMETRIC wavefunction.")
    print("  - A higher energy level with an ANTISYMMETRIC wavefunction.")
    print("For the tunneling phenomenon to be observable, both of these energy levels must be physically allowed states that the molecule can occupy.")

    print("\nStep 2: Consider the role of the Pauli Exclusion Principle.")
    print("---------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The Pauli Principle dictates the overall symmetry of a quantum system's total wavefunction when identical particles are exchanged.")
    print("  - For FERMIONS (like normal protons, spin 1/2), the total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - For BOSONS (like the exotic hydrogens, spin 0), the total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the wavefunction of the exotic ammonia molecule.")
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The total wavefunction can be seen as a product: Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial * Ψ_nuclear_spin")
    print("  - Our exotic hydrogens are BOSONS (spin 0), so Ψ_total must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - For spin-0 nuclei, there is only one possible nuclear spin state. This state is inherently SYMMETRIC upon particle exchange.")
    print("  - Since Ψ_total (Symmetric) = Ψ_spatial * Ψ_nuclear_spin (Symmetric), it follows that the spatial part, Ψ_spatial, must also be SYMMETRIC.")

    print("\nStep 4: Can both tunneling energy levels exist?")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("The spatial wavefunction Ψ_spatial is a product of vibrational and rotational parts. The key question is whether both the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational states (from Step 1) can exist as part of an overall symmetric spatial wavefunction.")
    print("  - Case 1 (Lower Energy Level): Can we have a symmetric Ψ_spatial with a SYMMETRIC vibrational state? Yes, by combining it with a symmetric rotational state. This level is ALLOWED.")
    print("  - Case 2 (Higher Energy Level): Can we have a symmetric Ψ_spatial with an ANTISYMMETRIC vibrational state? Yes, by combining it with an antisymmetric rotational state. This level is also ALLOWED.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final Conclusion.")
    print("---------------------------")
    print("Because the rules of quantum mechanics (the Pauli Principle for bosons) permit the existence of rotational states for BOTH the lower (symmetric) and upper (antisymmetric) vibrational levels, the energy splitting due to tunneling is real and observable.")
    print("The masses of the atoms and the potential energy barrier determine the rate of tunneling, while the nuclear spin statistics determine which specific rotational states are populated.")
    print("\nTherefore, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would indeed exhibit tunneling.")
