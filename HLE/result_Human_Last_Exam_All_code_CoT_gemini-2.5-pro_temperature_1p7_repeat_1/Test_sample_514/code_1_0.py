    This function explains the reasoning to find the number of components

    The space X is constructed from a Cantor set K, a countable dense set D,
    and the set of endpoints Q.
    X = (Q x D) U ((K \\ Q) x ([0,1] \\ D))
    The space Y is formed by identifying all points in Q x {1}.

    1. The space X before identification is totally disconnected. Any continuous
       path in X must be a constant point. This is because its projection onto the
       x-axis must be constant (map to a totally disconnected Cantor set), and
       then its projection onto the y-axis must also be constant (map to a
       totally disconnected set D or [0,1]\\D).

    2. We consider the space Y after identifying the set S = Q x {1} to a point.
       To count the components of Y, we can slice it horizontally.

    3. Let's pick a value y_0 that is not in D (e.g., y_0 = sqrt(2)/2).
       Such a y_0 exists because D is countable.
       The set of points in Y with y-coordinate equal to y_0 is Y_3.
       For a point (x, y_0) to be in the original space X, since y_0 is not in D,
       x must be in (K \\ Q).
       So, Y_3 = (K \\ Q) x {y_0}.

    4. The slice Y_3 is a closed subset of Y. Therefore, any connected component
       of Y_3 is also a connected component of Y.

    5. The space Y_3 is topologically equivalent to (K \\ Q), which is a subset
       of the Cantor set and is totally disconnected. Its connected components are
       its individual points.

    6. We count the number of points in Y_3.
       The Cantor set K is uncountable, with cardinality c (the continuum).
       The set of endpoints Q is countable (cardinality Aleph_0).
       The set K \\ Q has cardinality c - Aleph_0 = c.
       So, Y_3 contains c distinct points.

    7. Each of these c points is a connected component of Y. Since the total number of
       points in Y cannot exceed c, the total number of components is exactly c.
