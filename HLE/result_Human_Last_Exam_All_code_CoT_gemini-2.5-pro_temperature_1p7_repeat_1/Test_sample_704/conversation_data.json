    "This puzzle requires connecting Isaac Newton's color wheel, which he associated with the notes of a musical scale. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Establish Newton's Color-Note Mapping:** First, I will define the standard association between the seven colors of the spectrum and the seven notes of a Western musical scale as proposed by Newton.\n2.  **Identify the Key Colors and Notes:** The question involves two primary colors, \"yellow\" and \"blue\". I will find their corresponding musical notes from the mapping.\n3.  **Find the \"In-Between\" Note:** The phrase \"the range between\" can be interpreted as the musical note that sits between the notes for yellow and blue in the musical scale.\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** I will treat the musical scale as an ordered list. By finding the positions (indices) of the notes for yellow and blue, I can calculate the midpoint to find the note that lies between them.\n5.  **Verify the Result:** The note found in the previous step should correspond to the color green, which is the result of mixing yellow and blue paint. This cross-verification will confirm the answer.\n6.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these steps, print the explanation, show the calculation, and reveal the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by mapping Newton's color circle to the musical scale.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes and the musical scale itself.\n    color_to_note = {\n        'Red': 'C',\n        'Orange': 'D',\n        'Yellow': 'E',\n        'Green': 'F',\n        'Blue': 'G',\n        'Indigo': 'A',\n        'Violet': 'B'\n    }\n    # The C Major scale, which forms the basis for Newton's analogy.\n    scale = ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B']\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The puzzle connects colors to musical notes based on Isaac Newton's analogy.\")\n    print(f\"The mapping is: {color_to_note}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the two main colors from the question.\n    # The question is about the range between \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\" and \"blue itself\".\n    # This can be interpreted as finding the musical note between the notes for Yellow and Blue.\n    color1 = 'Yellow'\n    color2 = 'Blue'\n    \n    note1 = color_to_note[color1]\n    note2 = color_to_note[color2]\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: Identify the notes for the primary colors mentioned.\")\n    print(f\"The musical note for {color1} is {note1}.\")\n    print(f\"The musical note for {color2} is {note2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the note that sits between note1 and note2 in the scale.\n    index1 = scale.index(note1)\n    index2 = scale.index(note2)\n    \n    # Calculate the middle index.\n    middle_index = (index1 + index2) // 2\n    final_note = scale[middle_index]\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the musical note that lies between them in the scale.\")\n    print(\"We can do this by finding the average of their positions in the scale (0-indexed).\")\n    print(f\"The position of {note1} ('{color1}') is {index1}.\")\n    print(f\"The position of {note2} ('{color2}') is {index2}.\")\n    # The required part: output each number in the final equation!\n    print(f\"The calculation is: ({index1} + {index2}) // 2 = {middle_index}\")\n    print(f\"The note at position {middle_index} in the scale {scale} is '{final_note}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Verify the result.\n    # The note 'F' corresponds to the color 'Green'.\n    # Green is the color produced when you mix yellow and blue paint.\n    # This confirms the logic of the puzzle.\n    color_of_final_note = [key for key, value in color_to_note.items() if value == final_note][0]\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Verification\")\n    print(f\"The resulting note, '{final_note}', corresponds to the color {color_of_final_note} in Newton's system.\")\n    print(\"This makes perfect sense, as mixing yellow and blue paint produces the color green.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The musical note is {final_note}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_newton_puzzle()\n<<<F>>>\n```"
