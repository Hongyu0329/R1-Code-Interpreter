# The problem is to calculate the integral I = integral( (du/dt)^2 ) dx
# based on a PDE and several properties of its bi-soliton solution.
# Through analysis, the integral can be expressed as a product of constants and
# a definite integral that can be solved.

# The derivation gives I = (81 * k**4 / 4) * integral( (phi_x)^2 / phi^4 dx )
# The properties of the solution fix the parameter k=1.
k = 1

# The definite integral's value is derived to be 5/27.
integral_value = 5/27

# The coefficient in front of the integral
coefficient = (81 * k**4) / 4

# The final equation is I = coefficient * integral_value
final_value = coefficient * integral_value

# We output the numbers in the final equation as requested.
# The final equation is I = (81/4) * (5/27)
