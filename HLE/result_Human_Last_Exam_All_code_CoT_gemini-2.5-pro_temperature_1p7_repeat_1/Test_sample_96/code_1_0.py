# The problem asks for the number of certain torsion elements in the group A/Z
# where A is the Artin group of type E8.
# Based on the theory of Artin groups, these elements are constructed from Garside elements.

# The number of these elements equals the number of distinct Garside elements.
# For an Artin group whose Dynkin diagram is a tree, this number corresponds to the
# number of acyclic orientations of the diagram.

# The E8 Dynkin diagram is a tree with 8 vertices.
num_vertices = 8

# A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.
num_edges = num_vertices - 1

# For each edge, there are two possible directions. Since the graph is a tree,
# any choice of directions results in an acyclic orientation.
# The total number of acyclic orientations is 2 raised to the power of the number of edges.
base = 2
exponent = num_edges
num_elements = base ** exponent

# Final answer calculation:
# We need to compute 2 to the power of 7.
# Equation: Number of elements = 2^7
# Print the values used in the calculation as requested.
