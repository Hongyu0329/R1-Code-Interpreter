    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans*, I will use a Python script to analyze the worm's connectome.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the `c.elegans_wiring` Python library, which provides access to the recent and comprehensive connectome dataset from Witvliet et al. (2021).\n2.  The script will load the synaptic connectivity data.\n3.  It will filter this data to isolate all connections that originate from the presynaptic neurons ASJL and ASJR (the left and right ASJ pair).\n4.  To determine the main target \"cell\", which usually refers to a cell type (e.g., AIY) rather than an individual instance (e.g., AIYL), I will group the target neurons by their type by removing the 'L' or 'R' suffix from their names.\n5.  I will then sum the number of synapses for each target cell type to find the total synaptic input from ASJ.\n6.  Finally, the script will identify the cell type that receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ. To fulfill the prompt's requirement to show the numbers in the \"equation\", I will print the breakdown of how the total synapse count for the main target is calculated from its individual connections.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\ndef solve_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the main projection target of ASJ axons\n    in the adult C. elegans connectome by synapse number.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        from c_elegans_wiring.synapses import query_synapses\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Please install the required library first by running: pip install c.elegans-wiring pandas\")\n        return\n\n    # Load the synapse data from the Witvliet et al. 2021 dataset.\n    synapses_df = query_synapses()\n\n    # Define the presynaptic neurons of interest: ASJ Left and ASJ Right.\n    asj_presynaptic_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n\n    # Filter the dataframe to get all connections originating from ASJ neurons.\n    asj_outputs = synapses_df[synapses_df['pre_cell'].isin(asj_presynaptic_neurons)].copy()\n\n    # Define a function to get the cell \"type\" from a full cell name by removing L/R suffixes.\n    def get_cell_type(cell_name):\n        return re.sub(r'[LR]$', '', str(cell_name))\n\n    # Apply this function to create a new column for the target cell type.\n    asj_outputs['post_cell_type'] = asj_outputs['post_cell'].apply(get_cell_type)\n\n    # Group by the target cell type and sum the number of synapses ('N').\n    target_counts = asj_outputs.groupby('post_cell_type')['N'].sum().reset_index()\n\n    # Sort the results to find the target with the highest number of synapses.\n    sorted_targets = target_counts.sort_values(by='N', ascending=False)\n\n    if sorted_targets.empty:\n        print(\"Could not find any projection targets for ASJ neurons.\")\n        return\n\n    # Get the top target's information.\n    main_target_row = sorted_targets.iloc[0]\n    main_target_type = main_target_row['post_cell_type']\n\n    # Find the individual synaptic connections from ASJ to this main target type.\n    main_target_details = asj_outputs[asj_outputs['post_cell_type'] == main_target_type]\n    \n    print(f\"To find the main target of ASJ, we sum the synapses to each target cell type.\")\n    print(f\"The top target cell type is {main_target_type}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation for the total number of synapses from ASJ to this target is:\")\n\n    equation_parts = []\n    total_synapses = 0\n    # Sort details for a consistent output order\n    main_target_details_sorted = main_target_details.sort_values(by=['pre_cell', 'post_cell'])\n\n    for _, row in main_target_details_sorted.iterrows():\n        pre_cell = row['pre_cell']\n        post_cell = row['post_cell']\n        count = row['N']\n        # Each number in the \"equation\" is a specific connection's synapse count\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n        total_synapses += count\n        print(f\"Synapses from {pre_cell} to {post_cell}: {count}\")\n\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"\\nFinal calculation: {equation_str} = {total_synapses}\")\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The main projection target of ASJ axons is the {main_target_type} cell type, with a total of {total_synapses} synapses.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_asj_target()\n```\n<<<AIY>>>"
