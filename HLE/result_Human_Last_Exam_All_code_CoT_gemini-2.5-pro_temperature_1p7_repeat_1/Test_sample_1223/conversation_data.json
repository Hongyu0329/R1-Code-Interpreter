    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a problem in the field of topology, specifically continuum theory. The answer is based on established theorems rather than a direct computation. The code will serve to state these facts and present the conclusion.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the properties of the space in question, which is the Stone-Cech remainder of `X \\ {x}`.\n2.  Next, I will state a key theorem from continuum theory: for a hereditary indecomposable continuum `X`, the Stone-Cech remainder of `X \\ {x}` is itself a non-degenerate, hereditary indecomposable continuum. A canonical example of such a space is the pseudo-arc.\n3.  Then, I will state another fundamental property of indecomposable continua: any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has a number of composants equal to `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n4.  Finally, I will conclude that since the remainder always has `c` composants, the maximum possible number is `c`. The python code will print this logical progression.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_topology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a problem about the number of composants in a Stone-Cech remainder.\n    The solution is based on established theorems in continuum theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the mathematical objects involved.\n    # X is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n    # The space we consider is the Stone-Cech remainder of X \\ {x}, let's call it R.\n    space_description = \"R = β(X \\\\ {x}) \\\\ (X \\\\ {x})\"\n\n    # Step 2: Apply a known theorem about the nature of this remainder.\n    # A theorem in continuum theory states that for a hereditary indecomposable\n    # continuum X, the remainder R is itself a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n    remainder_property = \"Non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum\"\n\n    # Step 3: State the number of composants for such a continuum.\n    # A fundamental property of any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is that it has\n    # exactly 'c' composants, where 'c' is the cardinality of the continuum (2^ℵ₀).\n    num_composants = \"c (the cardinality of the continuum)\"\n\n    # Step 4: Formulate the final conclusion.\n    # Since the remainder R is always a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum,\n    # the number of its composants is always 'c'.
