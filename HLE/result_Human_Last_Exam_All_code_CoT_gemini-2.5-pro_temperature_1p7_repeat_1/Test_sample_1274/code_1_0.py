    # Part (a): Is α(K) context-free for every rational subset K ⊆ F?
    # Answer: No. A standard counterexample is the conjugacy closure of the element a^2*b^2 in the free group F(a,b).
    # The set K = {a^2*b^2} is rational (finite), but its conjugacy closure is not a context-free subset.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): If α(K) is context-free, does this imply that Geo(α(K)) is also context-free?
    # Answer: Yes. A free group has a context-free word problem. For any such group, if a subset S is context-free
    # (i.e., generated by a context-free language), then its language of geodesics, Geo(S), is also context-free.
    answer_b = "Yes"

    # Part (c): If K is context-free, determine if Geo(α(K)) must be context-free for a different choice of generating set A.
    # Answer: No. The property of a subset being context-free is independent of the choice of generators in a free group.
    # The question reduces to: if K is context-free, is α(K) necessarily context-free?
    # The counterexample from (a), K={a^2*b^2}, works here as well. K is context-free (even regular), but its conjugacy closure is not.
    answer_c = "No"

    # The final answers are combined and printed in the specified format.
    print(f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {answer_b}; (c) {answer_c}")
