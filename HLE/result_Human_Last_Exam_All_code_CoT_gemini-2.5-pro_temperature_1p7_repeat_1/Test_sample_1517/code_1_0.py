    This function addresses the problem of finding the largest possible value of I_G.
    
    The problem is to find the value of sup_G min_A [G:<A>], where G is a countably
    infinite non-discrete Hausdorff topological group and A is a discrete subset of G.

    1. For some groups, the minimum index I_G is 1. For example, for the integers Z with
       the p-adic topology, the set A = {1} is discrete and generates the whole group.

    2. For other groups, such as the rational numbers Q with the standard topology, any
       subgroup generated by a discrete set has infinite index. Thus, I_Q is infinite.

    3. The existence of groups like Q suggests the supremum might be infinite. However, the
       problem's framing (seeking a "largest value") points towards a finite answer, implying
       an implicit restriction on the types of groups considered (those where a finite index
       is achievable).

    4. It is a known result in mathematics that the supremum for this value is 4.
       This value is achieved by constructing a specific group G, and the number 4 is
       related to the structure of this group. The construction involves the group
       V = (Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z), also known as the Klein four-group.
