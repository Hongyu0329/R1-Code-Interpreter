    Calculates the shortest distance between the nodes with the maximum and

    The problem states that in any small rhombus, the sum of opposite vertices
    is equal. This implies that the value at any node is a linear function
    of its position. Therefore, the maximum and minimum values for the entire
    set of nodes must occur at the main vertices A, B, or C.
