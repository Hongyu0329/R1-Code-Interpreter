    "This is a classic riddle that requires associative thinking rather than direct translation. The solution lies in connecting the description of the location with the name of a poet.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the key elements of the riddle: \"wide boulevards of Vienna\" and \"English poet's surname\".\n2.  Consider the historical and cultural character of Vienna's boulevards. They are famously associated with a vibrant, lively, festive, and light-hearted atmosphere, especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n3.  An archaic but fitting English word to describe such an atmosphere is \"gay\".\n4.  The next step is to find a well-known English poet whose surname is a homonym of this descriptive word.\n5.  I will write a Python script that simulates this logical process by defining a list of potential descriptive words and a list of famous English poets. The script will then iterate through both lists to find the name that appears in both, revealing the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poet_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by finding an English poet whose surname matches\n    a word used to describe the atmosphere of Vienna's boulevards.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of famous English poets' surnames\n    poets = [\n        \"Shakespeare\", \"Wordsworth\", \"Byron\", \"Shelley\", \"Keats\",\n        \"Tennyson\", \"Browning\", \"Eliot\", \"Auden\", \"Blake\", \"Burns\", \"Gay\"\n    ]\n\n    # Words describing the vibrant, festive, and lively atmosphere of Vienna's boulevards\n    vienna_descriptors = [\n        \"grand\", \"wide\", \"lively\", \"festive\", \"imperial\", \"gay\"\n    ]\n\n    # Find the poet whose surname is also a descriptor\n    found_surname = None\n    for poet in poets:\n        if poet.lower() in vienna_descriptors:\n            found_surname = poet\n            break\n\n    if found_surname:\n        print(f\"The descriptive word associated with Viennese boulevards is '{found_surname.lower()}'.\")\n        print(f\"This matches the surname of the English poet John {found_surname}.\")\n        print(f\"The surname is: {found_surname}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not find a matching poet for the riddle.\")\n\nsolve_poet_riddle()\n```\n<<<Gay>>>"
