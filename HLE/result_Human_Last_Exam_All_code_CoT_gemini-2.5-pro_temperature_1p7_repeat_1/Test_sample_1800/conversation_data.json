    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria catalysts is a parameter determined through extensive experimental research, rather than a value that can be calculated from a simple formula. The goal is to maximize the number of active Ni sites, ensure their high dispersion, and promote a strong interaction with the Ceria support, which enhances its oxygen storage and release capabilities.\n\nBased on a review of scientific literature, an optimal composition is frequently found around a **10 mol% Ni loading**. This concentration provides an excellent balance: it's high enough for substantial catalytic activity but low enough to prevent the nickel nanoparticles from agglomerating (clumping together), which would reduce the active surface area and catalytic efficiency.\n\nI will provide a Python script that takes this literature-based optimal value (10 mol% Ni) and calculates the corresponding direct molar ratio of Ni to Ce.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio based on findings\n    from scientific literature for Ni-Ceria catalysts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on experimental literature, a common optimal loading is 10 mol% Ni.\n    # This means in a sample of 100 total moles of metal (Ni + Ce), 10 are Ni.\n    optimal_ni_moles = 10\n    total_moles = 100\n\n    # The rest of the moles are Cerium.\n    ce_moles = total_moles - optimal_ni_moles\n\n    # The ratio is Ni moles divided by Ce moles.\n    ni_ce_ratio = optimal_ni_moles / ce_moles\n\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is determined experimentally. A widely cited optimal value is around 10 mol% Ni.\")\n    print(\"This balances the number of active sites with nanoparticle dispersion and strong metal-support interaction.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the calculation to find the direct Ni to Ce molar ratio from this value:\")\n    print(f\"1.
