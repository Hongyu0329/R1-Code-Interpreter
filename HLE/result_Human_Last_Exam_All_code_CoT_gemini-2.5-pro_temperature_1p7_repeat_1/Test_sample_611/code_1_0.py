    This function calculates the limit of P[V_n > 2/3] based on analytical arguments.

    The problem asks for the limit of the probability P[V_n > 2/3] as n tends to infinity.
    V_n is the relative area of a disk B_n covered by a Wiener sausage of radius 1.
    The disk B_n is centered at n and has radius n/3.
    The process X_t generating the sausage is a complex Brownian motion conditioned to avoid the unit disk.

    The solution is found by a scaling argument:
    1. We apply a diffusive scaling: coordinates z are scaled to w = z/n, and time t is scaled to t' = t/n^2.
    2. Under this scaling, the disk B_n = {z: |z-n| <= n/3} becomes a fixed disk B' = {w: |w-1| <= 1/3}.
    3. The process X_t, when scaled, becomes a new process X'_t'. As n -> infinity, this scaled process converges to a standard complex Brownian motion Z_t', because its drift term vanishes.
    4. The sausage of radius 1 for the original process corresponds to a sausage of radius 1/n for the scaled process.
    5. So, V_n is the relative area of B' covered by a sausage of radius 1/n around the path of X'_t'.
    6. As n -> infinity, the sausage radius 1/n goes to 0. The limiting sausage is just the path of the Brownian motion Z_t', which has zero area.
    7. Therefore, the relative area V_n converges to 0 in probability.

    We need to find lim_{n->inf} P[V_n > 2/3].
    Since V_n converges to 0 in probability, the probability that V_n exceeds any positive constant must go to 0.
