    "To answer your historical question, I will use a Python script. My plan is to first identify Andre Vernault's true profession from my knowledge base. Then, to meet the specific instruction to output an \"equation\" containing numbers, the script will convert each letter of the profession into its corresponding number in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.). Finally, it will display this as a numerical \"equation\" that resolves to the answer word before stating the answer clearly.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the trivia question about Andre Vernault by constructing an\n    \"equation\" from the letters of his profession, as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The answer to the historical question, based on my knowledge base.\n    profession = \"smuggler\"\n\n    # Create a list to hold the numeric value of each letter (a=1, b=2, etc.).\n    numbers = []\n    for char in profession:\n        # 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, and so on.\n        number = string.ascii_lowercase.index(char) + 1\n        numbers.append(str(number))\n\n    # Format the numbers and the final word into an \"equation\".\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(numbers)\n\n    # Print the final equation as requested.\n    print(\"Here is the equation to reveal the profession:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {profession}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Based on historical records, Andre Vernault's concealed true profession was: {profession}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<smuggler>>>"
