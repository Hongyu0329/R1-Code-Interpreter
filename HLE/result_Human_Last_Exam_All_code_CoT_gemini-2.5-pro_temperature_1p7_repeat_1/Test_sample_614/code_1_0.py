# Based on the riddle's clues, we can determine the correct order of the five numbers.

# "Number 1 is the first..."
# This sets the first number in our sequence.
sequence = [1]

# "...the fifth, who never had a thing and lastly follows."
# "Number three is the strongest and it protects the last;"
# This sets the last two numbers. The fifth number (5) is last, 
# and the third number (3) is just before it.
last_two = [3, 5]

# "Number 4 likes two the most and it always goes behind."
# This means the number 4 must come directly after the number 2.
middle_pair = [2, 4]

# We assemble the sequence from the parts we've deduced.
final_sequence = sequence + middle_pair + last_two

# Now, we print the final ordered sequence.
# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation".
# We will represent the ordered sequence like an equation showing the flow.
print("The final order is:")
print(final_sequence[0], ">", final_sequence[1], ">", final_sequence[2], ">", final_sequence[3], ">", final_sequence[4])
