    "Of course, I can help you with that. This problem can be solved by using the properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), specifically those related to upsampling and time-shifting.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relationship** between the target 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, and the original 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`. The target sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n2.  **Use DFT properties** to find the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` from the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n    *   We can think of `y(n)` as the sum of two 8-point sequences:\n        *   `y1(n) = {x(0), 0, x(1), 0, x(2), 0, x(3), 0}` (This is `x(n)` upsampled by 2)\n        *   `y2(n) = {0, h(0), 0, h(1), 0, h(2), 0, h(3)}` (This is `h(n)` upsampled by 2 and shifted by 1)\n    *   The DFT of an upsampled sequence is a periodic repetition of the original sequence's DFT. Therefore, the 8-point DFT of `y1(n)` is `Y1(k) = X(k mod 4)`.\n    *   Similarly, the 8-point DFT of `{h(0), 0, h(1), 0, ...}` would be `H(k mod 4)`. Since `y2(n)` is shifted by one sample, its DFT is `Y2(k) = W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`, where `W_8 = exp(-j*2*pi/8)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n    *   By the linearity property of the DFT, `Y(k) = Y1(k) + Y2(k)`.\n\n3.  **Final Formula**: This gives us a direct formula to calculate the desired 8-point DFT `Y(k)`:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\n4.  **Execute the Code**: The Python code below will implement this formula, calculating `Y(k)` for each `k` from 0 to 7 and printing each step of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence y(n)\n# given the 4-point DFTs of the original sequences, X(k) and H(k).\n#\n# The interleaved sequence is y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), ...}\n# The formula derived from DFT properties (upsampling, time-shifting, linearity) is:\n# Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + (W_8^k) * H(k mod 4)\n# where W_8 = exp(-j*2*pi/8) is the twiddle factor.\n\n# Step 1: Define the given 4-point DFTs as numpy arrays.\nX_k = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\nH_k = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j])\n\nprint(\"Given 4-point DFTs:\")\nprint(f\"X(k) = {X_k}\")\nprint(f\"H(k) = {H_k}\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Set up parameters for the calculation.\nN = 4  # Size of original DFTs\nM = 8  # Size of the target DFT\n\n# According to the upsampling property, the 8-point DFTs of the upsampled\n# sequences are periodic repetitions of the original 4-point DFTs.\nG1_k = np.tile(X_k, M // N)  # This represents X(k mod 4) for k=0..7\nG2_k = np.tile(H_k, M // N)  # This represents H(k mod 4) for k=0..7\n\n# Calculate the twiddle factors W_M^k needed for the time-shift property.\nk_values = np.arange(M)\nW_M_k = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k_values / M)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate and print the result for each value of k from 0 to 7.\nprint(\"Calculating the 8-point DFT Y(k) using the formula:\")\nprint(f\"Y(k) = X(k mod {N}) + (W_{M}^k) * H(k mod {N})\")\nprint(\"=\" * 60)\n\nfinal_Y_k = []\nfor k in range(M):\n    # Get the components for the current value of k\n    g1 = G1_k[k]\n    g2 = G2_k[k]\n    w = W_M_k[k]\n\n    # Calculate the final result for Y(k)\n    y = g1 + w * g2\n    final_Y_k.append(y)\n    \n    # Format the numbers for a clean, readable output equation\n    g1_str = f\"({g1:.2f})\".replace(\".00\", \"\").replace(\"+0.00j\", \"\").replace(\"-0.00j\", \"\").replace(\"0.00-\", \"-\").replace(\"0.00+\", \"\")\n    w_str = f\"({w.real:.3f}{w.imag:+.3f}j)\"\n    g2_str = f\"({g2:.2f})\".replace(\".00\", \"\").replace(\"+0.00j\", \"\").replace(\"-0.00j\", \"\").replace(\"0.00-\", \"-\").replace(\"0.00+\", \"\")\n    y_str = f\"({y.real:.4f}{y.imag:+.4f}j)\"\n\n    # Print the equation with all the numbers for the current step\n    print(f\"Y({k}) = {g1_str} + {w_str} * {g2_str}\")\n    print(f\"     = {y_str}\\n\")\n\n# Convert list to a numpy array for final display\nY_k_result = np.array(final_Y_k)\n\nprint(\"=\" * 60)\nprint(\"The final 8-point DFT sequence Y(k) is:\")\n# We use np.round to present a clean final result\nprint(np.round(Y_k_result, 4))\n<<<[ 1.    +0.j      1.4142+1.j     -1.    -1.j     -1.4142-1.j\n  1.    +0.j     -1.4142+1.j     -1.    +1.j      1.4142-1.j    ]>>>\n```"
