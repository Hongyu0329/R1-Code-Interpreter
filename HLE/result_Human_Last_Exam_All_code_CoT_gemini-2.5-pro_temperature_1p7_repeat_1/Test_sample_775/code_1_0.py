    Analyzes the number of components in the intersection of two sets A and B

    The problem asks for the largest number of components in the intersection
    of two closed, connected sets whose union is the unit square.

    Let's define our sets based on a 2x2 checkerboard pattern.
    The unit square is [0, 1] x [0, 1].

    Set A is the union of the bottom-left and top-right squares.
    Set B is the union of the top-left and bottom-right squares.
