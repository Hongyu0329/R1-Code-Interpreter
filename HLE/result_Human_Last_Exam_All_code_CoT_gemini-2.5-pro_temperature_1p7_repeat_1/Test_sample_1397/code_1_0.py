    # The problem asks for the smallest composite number n for which a graph G exists with:
    # 1. n vertices
    # 2. 7-regular (all vertices have degree 7)
    # 3. Chromatic number χ(G) = 5
    # 4. Exactly n copies of C5 (cycles of length 5)
    # 5. No three of these C5s share a common vertex

    # Let's analyze the properties related to the 5-cycles (C5).
    # Let N_C5 be the total number of 5-cycles. Property 4 says N_C5 = n.
    # Let c(v) be the number of 5-cycles containing vertex v. Property 5 says c(v) <= 2 for all vertices v.

    # We can count the total number of (vertex, C5) incidences in two ways (double counting):
    # 1. Sum over vertices:  Total incidences = Σ c(v) over all n vertices.
    # 2. Sum over cycles:   Total incidences = 5 * N_C5 (since each C5 has 5 vertices).
    
    # This gives the equality: Σ c(v) = 5 * N_C5.
    # Since N_C5 = n, we have: Σ c(v) = 5 * n.

    # From Property 5, we know c(v) <= 2. Summing over all vertices gives:
    # Σ c(v) <= 2 * n.

    # Combining these results gives the contradiction: 5 * n <= 2 * n, which implies n <= 0 for any n.
    # However, n must be a composite number, so n > 1. This shows no such graph can exist.

    # The prompt requests the final equation. Let's derive it more formally.
    # Let n_k be the number of vertices belonging to exactly k C5s.
    # Total vertices: n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + ... = n. Since c(v) <= 2, this is n_0 + n_1 + n_2 = n.
    # Total incidences: 0*n_0 + 1*n_1 + 2*n_2 = 5 * n.

    # We have a system of two equations:
    # 1) n_1 + n_2 + n_0 = n
    # 2) n_1 + 2*n_2     = 5n
    
    # From (2), n_1 = 5n - 2*n_2. Substitute into (1):
    # (5n - 2*n_2) + n_2 + n_0 = n
    # 5n - n_2 + n_0 = n
    # This simplifies to the final equation:
    n2 = "n_2"
    n0 = "n_0"
    four = 4
    n_var = "n"
    
    print(f"Let n be the number of vertices.")

    print(f"From the problem's constraints, we can derive the following equation:")
    print(f"Equation: {n2} - {n0} = {four} * {n_var}")

    print("\nThis equation demonstrates the impossibility of such a graph.")
    print("Explanation:")
    print(f"The number of vertices in 2 C5s ({n2}) cannot exceed the total number of vertices ({n_var}). So, {n2} <= {n_var}.")
    print(f"From the equation, {n2} = {n0} + {four}*{n_var}.")
    print(f"Substituting this into the inequality gives: {n0} + {four}*{n_var} <= {n_var}, which simplifies to {n0} <= -3*{n_var}.")
    print(f"Since {n0} (a count of vertices) must be non-negative and {n_var} (a composite number) must be positive, this inequality can never be true.")
    print("Therefore, no graph with the given properties exists, and there is no value for n.")
