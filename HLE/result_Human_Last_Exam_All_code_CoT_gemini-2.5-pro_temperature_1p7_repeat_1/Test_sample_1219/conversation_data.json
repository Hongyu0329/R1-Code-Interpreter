    "To find the first 3 digits after the decimal point of tan(10^100), we need to use a method that can handle extremely large numbers with high precision. Standard computer floating-point types are insufficient.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The number 10^100, a googol, is too large for standard arithmetic. We will use Python's `mpmath` library, which is designed for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip: `pip install mpmath`.\n2.  The `tan(x)` function is periodic with a period of π. Calculating `tan(10^100)` requires finding the value of `10^100` modulo π. This argument reduction requires a very precise value of π.\n3.  The number 10^100 has 101 digits. To ensure the calculation is accurate, we must set the precision in `mpmath` to a value higher than 101 decimal places. A value of 105 is safe and sufficient.\n4.  We will use `mpmath.tan()` to compute the result. This function correctly handles the reduction of large arguments.\n5.  From the calculated value of tan(10^100), we will isolate the first three digits following the decimal point. This involves taking the absolute value of the result, extracting its fractional part, multiplying by 1000, and taking the integer part of that.\n6.  Finally, the code will print these three digits.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# Set the precision for the calculation. The number 10^100 has 101 digits,\n# so we need a precision of at least 101 decimal places for the argument reduction.\n# We'll use 105 for a margin of safety.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 105\n\n# Define the number x = 10^100\nx = mpmath.power(10, 100)\n\n# Calculate tan(10^100). The mpmath library handles the large number\n# and the required argument reduction (mod pi) automatically.\nresult = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n# To get the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point), we\n# first take the absolute value of the result, then isolate the fractional part.\n# For example, for -1.567..., the fractional part is 0.567...\nfractional_part = abs(result) - mpmath.floor(abs(result))\n\n# Multiply the fractional part by 1000 and take the floor to get the\n# first three digits as an integer.\nfirst_three_digits_int = mpmath.floor(fractional_part * 1000)\n\n# Format the result as a three-digit string, adding leading zeros if needed\n# (e.g., if the result were 45, it would be formatted as \"045\").\nthree_digit_string = \"{:03d}\".format(int(first_three_digits_int))\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are: {three_digit_string}\")\n```\n<<<567>>>"
