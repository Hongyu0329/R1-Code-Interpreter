    "This is a historical question that can be answered by researching the life of Geoffrey Chaucer and the death of Blanche of Lancaster. Here is my plan to answer the question:\n\n1.  **Establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death:** I will first find out the year she died.\n2.  **Research Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts during that year:** I will then look into Chaucer's biography and historical records to determine his location or activities during the year of Blanche's death.\n3.  **Synthesize the information:** I will connect his location to the event. Blanche of Lancaster died in 1368. At that time, Geoffrey Chaucer was in the service of the English royal court as an esquire. His first major poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written as an elegy for Blanche, at the request of her husband, John of Gaunt. This strongly places him within the English court circle at the time.\n\nBased on this, the correct answer is England. I will create a Python script to print out this reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Date of Blanche of Lancaster's death\nyear_of_death = 1368\n\n# Geoffrey Chaucer's known location and occupation around that time\n# Historical records show that by 1367, Chaucer was a member of the English royal court\n# as a valet and later an esquire to King Edward III.\n# He was receiving a life pension for his services.\n# His poem \"The Book of the Duchess,\" a tribute to Blanche, was written in England\n# shortly after her death, for his patron, Blanche's husband, John of Gaunt.\n\nchaucers_location = \"England\"\nchaucers_occupation = \"Esquire in the English royal court\"\n\nprint(f\"Blanche of Lancaster died in {year_of_death}.\")\nprint(f\"At that time, Geoffrey Chaucer was an {chaucers_occupation}.\")\nprint(\"His famous poem 'The Book of the Duchess' was an elegy for her, written for his English patron, John of Gaunt.\")\nprint(f\"This strongly indicates that Geoffrey Chaucer was in {chaucers_location} when Blanche of Lancaster died.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
