    "To determine how many elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Homology Cobordism Group**: The group in question, denoted `Θ^3_H`, consists of integral homology 3-spheres under the equivalence relation of homology cobordism. This group is known to be isomorphic to `Z/2Z`, meaning it has exactly two elements: the trivial element (represented by the 3-sphere, S³) and one non-trivial element (represented by the Poincaré homology sphere).\n\n2.  **Relate Surgery to Group Elements**: An integral surgery on a knot `K` produces a homology 3-sphere `M(K, n)` where the surgery coefficient `n` is `+1` or `-1`. The element this manifold represents in `Θ^3_H` is determined by its Rohlin invariant, `μ(M)`. The trivial element has `μ=0`, and the non-trivial element has `μ=1`.\n\n3.  **Use Known Formulas for Rohlin Invariant**:\n    *   For `+1` surgery on any knot `K`, the resulting manifold `M(K, +1)` has a Rohlin invariant of `0`. This means `+1` surgery always produces a representative of the **trivial element**.\n    *   For `-1` surgery on a knot `K`, the Rohlin invariant is equal to the Arf invariant of the knot, i.e., `μ(M(K, -1)) = Arf(K)`. The Arf invariant can be `0` or `1`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Arf Invariant**: The Arf invariant of a knot `K` can be calculated from its Alexander polynomial, `Δ_K(t)`. If `Δ_K(-1)` is congruent to `±1` modulo 8, `Arf(K) = 0`. If it's congruent to `±3` modulo 8, `Arf(K) = 1`.\n\n5.  **Check Knots Up to Four Crossings**: We need to examine the knots with at most four crossings (`0_1`, `3_1`, `4_1`) and compute their Arf invariants. By doing this, we can see if it's possible to produce both the trivial (`0`) and non-trivial (`1`) elements.\n\nThis plan will allow us to find all representable elements and provide the final count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements representable\n    by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Goal: Find how many elements of the homology cobordism group Θ^3_H = Z/2Z can be represented.\")\n    print(\"Method: Check representatives from integral surgeries on knots with <= 4 crossings.\")\n    print(\"An element is identified by its Rohlin invariant (0 for trivial, 1 for non-trivial).\\n\")\n    print(\"Key Formulas:\")\n    print(\"1.
