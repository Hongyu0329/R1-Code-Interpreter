    "This is a fascinating question from the field of topology, specifically continuum theory. To solve it, we need to understand a few key concepts and a crucial theorem.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space. Think of an interval `[0,1]`, a disk, or a sphere.\n    *   A **nondegenerate continuum** is one that contains more than one point.\n    *   A **composant** of a point `p` in a continuum `X` is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. Two points are in the same composant if there's a proper subcontinuum containing both. The set of all composants partitions the continuum.\n    *   The **product of two continua**, `X` and `Y`, is the Cartesian product `X × Y` with the product topology. The product of two continua is also a continuum.\n\n2.  **Formulate a plan:**\n    *   The question asks for the *largest possible number* of composants of the product `X × Y`.\n    *   There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that relates the composants of a product space to the composants of its factor spaces: **The number of composants of `X × Y` is equal to the product of the number of composants of `X` and the number of composants of `Y`**.\n    *   Therefore, our goal is to find nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y` that have the maximum possible number of composants.\n\n3.  **Find the maximum number of composants for a single continuum:**\n    *   The number of composants a continuum can have can be 1 (for a simple decomposable continuum like a line segment), countably infinite, or uncountably infinite.\n    *   The maximum possible number of composants is achieved by **indecomposable continua** (continua that cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua).\n    *   For any nondegenerate indecomposable continuum (like the famous **pseudo-arc** or the **dyadic solenoid**), the number of composants is **c**, which is the cardinality of the continuum, `2^ℵ₀`. This is an uncountable infinity.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final result:**\n    *   To get the largest possible number of composants for `X × Y`, we choose `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate indecomposable continua.\n    *   Number of composants of `X` = `c`.\n    *   Number of composants of `Y` = `c`.\n    *   Number of composants of `X × Y` = (Number of composants of `X`) * (Number of composants of `Y`) = `c * c`.\n    *   According to the laws of cardinal arithmetic, for any infinite cardinal number `κ`, `κ * κ = κ`. Therefore, `c * c = c`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to symbolically represent this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest possible number of composants of the product of two\n    nondegenerate continua.\n\n    The solution is symbolic, as it involves transfinite cardinal numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 'c' symbolically represents the cardinality of the continuum (2^ℵ₀),\n    # which is the largest possible number of composants for a single continuum.\n    c = \"c\"\n\n    # To maximize the number of composants in the product space X x Y, we must\n    # choose continua X and Y that have the maximum possible number of composants.\n    # This maximum is achieved with indecomposable continua.\n    max_composants_X = c\n    max_composants_Y = c\n\n    # A theorem in continuum theory states that the number of composants of the\n    # product of two continua is the product of their individual numbers of composants.\n    # In cardinal arithmetic, c * c = c.\n    product_composants = c\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"Let 'c' be the cardinality of the continuum.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of composants for a nondegenerate continuum X is {max_composants_X}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of composants for a nondegenerate continuum Y is {max_composants_Y}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of composants of the product space X × Y is the product of the number of a composants of X and Y.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation using cardinal arithmetic is:\")\n    # We output each 'number' (symbol) in the final equation.\n    print(f\"{max_composants_X} * {max_composants_Y} = {product_composants}\")\n\nsolve_composants_problem()\n```\n<<<c>>>"
