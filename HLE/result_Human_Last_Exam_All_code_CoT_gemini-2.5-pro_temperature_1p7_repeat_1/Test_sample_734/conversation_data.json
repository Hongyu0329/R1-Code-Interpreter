    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the specific Christian theologian who fits the description. The key criteria are:\n1.  They must be a Christian theologian.\n2.  They must have been the *first* to develop *specialized terminology*.\n3.  This terminology must describe changes or suspensions of the laws of nature.\n4.  The framework must be applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the changes to nature resulting from the Fall of Man.\n\nAfter researching major theological figures and their work on miracles, creation, and natural law, the theologian who most clearly fits this description is **Augustine of Hippo** (354â€“430 AD).\n\nAugustine argued that miracles are not \"contrary to nature,\" but rather \"contrary to our *knowledge* of nature.\" He developed a sophisticated framework to explain this, using specialized Latin terms. He distinguished between the ordinary or \"usual course of nature\" (*cursus naturae*) and the deeper potential within creation, which he called \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*). In his view, God embedded these hidden potentialities within the world at creation, which could then manifest at a later time.\n\nThis framework allowed him to explain:\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** Not a violation of nature, but the manifestation of a potential that God, the author of nature, had reserved and could bring forth outside of the *usual* course of reproduction.\n*   **The Fall:** The changes in the world after the Fall (e.g., death, toil, thorns) could be understood as a shift in which aspects of nature's potential became manifest, changing the *cursus naturae* for humanity and the world.\n\nWhile others, like Thomas Aquinas, would later build on these ideas, Augustine was the first to develop this kind of systematic, terminological approach to the problem in the Western Christian tradition.\n\nAs requested, I will provide the answer in a Python code block.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Christian theologian who first developed\n    specialized terminology for changes in natural law, applicable to both\n    the virgin birth and the effects of the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The theologian is Augustine of Hippo. He used terms like \"cursus naturae\"\n    # (the usual course of nature) and \"rationes seminales\" (seminal reasons)\n    # to explain how miracles and events like the Fall were not violations of\n    # nature itself, but were actions by the Creator of nature that operated\n    # outside of its usual, observable patterns.\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n\n    # Print the name as the final answer.\n    print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
