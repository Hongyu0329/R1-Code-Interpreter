    # --- Part 1: Specific Procedures for Appropriate Management ---
    print("Part 1: Immediate & Systemic Management Plan\n")
    print("The management must be sequential, prioritizing life and systemic health before addressing the dental issues.")
    print("1. Medical Stabilization:")
    print("   - Control Diabetes: The glycated hemoglobin level of {}% indicates poorly controlled diabetes. This impairs healing and increases infection risk. An urgent consultation with an endocrinologist or general physician is needed to start treatment (e.g., Metformin, Insulin) to bring blood glucose to a safe level for any surgical procedure.".format(hba1c))
    print("   - Infection Prophylaxis: Due to the {} hour delay and diabetic status, there is a high risk of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary.".format(time_to_hospital))
    print("   - Tetanus Prophylaxis: A tetanus shot is required due to the nature of the injury.")
    print("2. Acute Dental & Facial Trauma Management:")
    print("   - Wound Care: The site of the lost teeth (alveolar sockets) needs to be cleaned (debrided) and irrigated to remove any debris.")
    print("   - Radiographs: A panoramic radiograph and periapical X-rays are needed to assess the health of remaining teeth and check for jaw fractures.")
    print("   - Pain Management: Analgesics should be prescribed.")

    # --- Part 2: Cells of Interest ---
    print("\nPart 2: Cells of Interest\n")
    print("The key cells for healing the wound are:")
    print("- Macrophages and Neutrophils: These are immune cells critical for cleaning the wound of bacteria and debris. Their function (chemotaxis, phagocytosis) is impaired by high blood sugar.")
    print("- Fibroblasts: Responsible for creating collagen and forming new connective tissue. Hyperglycemia reduces their proliferation and function.")
    print("- Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts: These cells are responsible for bone remodeling and healing of the tooth sockets. Diabetes can negatively affect their balance, leading to poor bone healing.")

    # --- Part 3 & 4: Definitive Dental Restoration (Denture Replacement) ---
    print("\nPart 3 & 4: Denture Replacement, Material, and Abutment Teeth\n")
    print("Once the patient is medically stable, a long-term dental solution can be planned. Given the patient's systemic condition (uncontrolled diabetes), a long-span edentulous area, and skeletal pattern, a removable denture is a very practical and appropriate choice over a fixed bridge or immediate implants.")
    print("\n- Recommended Denture Type: A Cast Partial Denture (CPD).")
    print("\n- Material:")
    print("  - Framework: Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy. This is strong, rigid, hygienic, and allows for a less bulky design compared to acrylic, promoting better gum health.")
    print("  - Teeth: High-quality acrylic teeth would be used for esthetics.")
    print("\n- Skeletal Consideration: The SNB angle of {} degrees indicates mandibular prognathism (Class III skeletal pattern). The design of the denture's biting surface must accommodate this to ensure stability and function.".format(snb_angle))
    print("\n- Abutment Teeth and Reasons:")
    print("  - Primary Abutments: The teeth adjacent to the gap, which are the Left Central Incisor and the Left Second Premolar.")
    print("  - Reasons:")
    print("    1. Support: They will bear some of the chewing forces, preventing the denture from sinking into the gums.")
    print("    2. Retention: Clasps (metal arms) will be placed on these teeth to hold the denture firmly in place.")
    print("    3. Stability: They prevent the denture from moving side-to-side during function. The health of these teeth must be confirmed with X-rays before using them as abutments.")
