    "For an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine, a certain percentage of the vaccinated population (`p`) becomes fully immune, while the remaining percentage (`1-p`) has the same susceptibility as the unvaccinated population. The true vaccine efficacy is therefore `p`.\n\nWe can determine the relationship between this true efficacy and the commonly measured efficacy `(1 - Incidence Rate Ratio)` by modeling the incidence rates.\n\n1.  Let `λ_U` be the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n2.  In the vaccinated group, a fraction `p` is immune (incidence rate = 0) and a fraction `1-p` is susceptible (incidence rate = `λ_U`).\n3.  The overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group, `λ_V`, is the weighted average: `λ_V = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * λ_U) = (1-p) * λ_U`.\n4.  The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) is `λ_V / λ_U = ((1-p) * λ_U) / λ_U = 1-p`.\n5.  The measured vaccine efficacy is `1 - IRR = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n\nSince the measured efficacy (`p`) is equal to the true efficacy (`p`), the `1 - IRR` **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this scenario to demonstrate the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = buffer = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Explanation and Plan ---\n# For an all-or-nothing vaccine, a proportion 'p' of vaccinees are fully protected,\n# and '(1-p)' are not protected at all. The true efficacy is 'p'.\n# We will model the incidence rates to see what '1 - IRR' calculates.\n#\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the true vaccine efficacy 'p' (e.g., 80% or 0.8).\n# 2. Assume an incidence rate for the unvaccinated group (lambda_U).\n# 3. Calculate the incidence rate for the vaccinated group (lambda_V). Since only\n#    the '(1-p)' proportion is at risk, lambda_V = (1-p) * lambda_U.\n# 4. Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = lambda_V / lambda_U.\n# 5. Calculate the estimated VE = 1 - IRR.\n# 6. Compare the estimated VE to the true 'p' and print the conclusion.\n\n# --- Simulation ---\n\n# Step 1: Define true 'all-or-nothing' vaccine efficacy (p)\ntrue_ve = 0.80\n\n# Step 2: Define a hypothetical incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (lambda_U)\n# (e.g., 10 cases per 100 person-years)\nlambda_unvaccinated = 0.10\n\nprint(\"--- Scenario Setup ---\")\nprint(f\"True 'All-or-Nothing' Vaccine Efficacy (p) = {true_ve:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated (λ_U) = {lambda_unvaccinated:.2f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 25)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the theoretical incidence rate in the vaccinated group (lambda_V)\nlambda_vaccinated = (1 - true_ve) * lambda_unvaccinated\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)\nirr = lambda_vaccinated / lambda_unvaccinated\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the vaccine efficacy estimate from the IRR\nestimated_ve = 1 - irr\n\n# --- Final Equation and Result ---\nprint(\"The final calculation is: Estimated VE = 1 - (λ_V / λ_U)\")\nprint(f\"Estimated VE = 1 - ({lambda_vaccinated:.4f} / {lambda_unvaccinated:.2f})\")\nprint(f\"Estimated VE = 1 - {irr:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Estimated VE = {estimated_ve:.2f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 25)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\nprint(f\"The true vaccine efficacy was set to: {true_ve:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The estimated vaccine efficacy (1 - IRR) is: {estimated_ve:.2f}\")\n\nif estimated_ve == true_ve:\n    print(\"\\nResult: 1 - IRR correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nResult: 1 - IRR does not correctly estimate the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\")\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Print the captured output to the console\nprint(buffer.getvalue())\n<<<C>>>\n```"
