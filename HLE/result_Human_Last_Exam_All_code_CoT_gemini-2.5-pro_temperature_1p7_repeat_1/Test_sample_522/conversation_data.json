    "I have analyzed the input-output pairs to determine the transformation rule. My step-by-step thinking process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Represent the Data**: First, I'll parse the input strings into 2D grids of numbers. This makes it easier to work with coordinates and neighbors.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Operation**: In both examples A and B, a `2` and a `0` swap their positions. Specifically, the cell with the `2` becomes `0`, and a cell that was `0` becomes `2`. The core of the puzzle is to figure out which `0` is chosen as the swap target.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis**: I hypothesized that the neighbors of the `2` provide a clue. I calculated the sum of the 8 neighbors for the `2` in each example (let's call this `S2`).\n    *   In `Input_A`, the `2` is at `(1,1)`. Its neighbors are `0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1`. The sum `S2` is 6.\n    *   In `Input_B`, the `2` is at `(3,6)`. Its neighbors are `0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0`. The sum `S2` is 4.\n\n4.  **Find the Target's Property**: Next, I looked at the properties of the `0` that was chosen as the target. I calculated the sum of the 8 neighbors for the target `0` in each case (let's call this `S0`).\n    *   In `Input_A`, the target `0` is at `(0,0)`. Its neighbors are `0,1,2` (plus out-of-bounds `0`s). The sum `S0` is 3.\n    *   In `Input_B`, the target `0` is at `(2,7)`. Its neighbors are `0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1`. The sum `S0` is 5.\n\n5.  **Discover the Rule**: I observed a simple and elegant relationship between these sums:\n    *   In `Input_A`: `S2 + S0 = 6 + 3 = 9`.\n    *   In `Input_B`: `S2 + S0 = 4 + 5 = 9`.\n    The rule seems to be: **The `2` swaps with the first `0` (in reading order) whose neighbor sum `S0` is equal to `9 - S2`**.\n\n6.  **Verify with `Input_C`**: The provided `Output_C` is `MISSING`. This gives a crucial clue for what happens when the rule cannot be satisfied.\n    *   In `Input_C`, the `2` is at `(1,4)`. The sum of its neighbors (`S2`) is `0+0+0+1+1+1+1+0 = 4`.\n    *   According to the rule, the required neighbor sum for the target `0` must be `S0 = 9 - 4 = 5`.\n    *   I then checked the neighbor sum for every `0` in `Input_C`. None of them have a neighbor sum of 5.\n    *   This explains why the output is `MISSING`: there is no `0` in the grid that satisfies the condition.\n\n7.  **Final Plan**: I will now provide Python code that implements this logic. The code will take `Input_C` as input, apply the discovered rule, and, since no valid target `0` can be found, it will print `MISSING` as the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by finding a '2', calculating its neighbor sum S2,\n    then finding the first '0' (in reading order) whose neighbor sum S0\n    satisfies the rule S2 + S0 = 9.
