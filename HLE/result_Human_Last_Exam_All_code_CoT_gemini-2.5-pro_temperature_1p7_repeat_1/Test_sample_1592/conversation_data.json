    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Coordinates**: First, I will find the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish, Quebec.\n2.  **Identify Neighbors**: Next, I will identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec: Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut.\n3.  **Find Border Points**: For each neighboring province/territory, I will determine the coordinates of a point on its border that is closest to Waskaganish.\n4.  **Calculate Distances**: I will use the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, to find the distance from Waskaganish to each of the border points.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: Finally, I will compare these calculated distances to find the minimum one, which will correspond to the closest province or territory. The script will print each calculated distance before declaring the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform these calculations and find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth's mean radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371.0\n\n    # Convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # Differences in coordinates\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    distance = R * c\n\n    return distance\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to find the closest province/territory to Waskaganish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for Waskaganish, Quebec\n    waskaganish_lat = 51.1931\n    waskaganish_lon = -78.7592\n\n    # A dictionary of the closest points on the borders of neighboring provinces/territories\n    # Quebec-Ontario border runs south from James Bay at approx. 79.52° W longitude.\n    # The closest part of Nunavut is Akimiski Island in James Bay.\n    locations = {\n        \"Ontario\": (51.1931, -79.52),          # Point on the border at the same latitude\n        \"Nunavut\": (52.4, -80.8),              # Southern coast of Akimiski Island\n        \"Newfoundland and Labrador\": (52.2, -67.4), # Point on the western border\n        \"New Brunswick\": (47.8, -69.2)         # Point on the northern border\n    }\n\n    distances = {}\n    print(f\"Finding the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec (51.19° N, 78.76° W)...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate and store the distance to each location\n    for province, (lat, lon) in locations.items():\n        dist = calculate_distance(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, lat, lon)\n        distances[province] = dist\n        # Print each number used in the final comparison\n        print(f\"Distance to the border of {province:<25} is {dist:>7.2f} km.\")\n\n    # Find the province with the minimum distance\n    closest_province = min(distances, key=distances.get)\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_province}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<Ontario>>>"
