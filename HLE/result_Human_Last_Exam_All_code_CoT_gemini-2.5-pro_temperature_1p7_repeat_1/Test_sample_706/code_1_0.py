    Calculates the limit of the asymptotic speed v(c) as c -> infinity.
    The derivation is based on a renewal argument, analyzing the walker's behavior
    as a cycle of moving on the lower rail and taking excursions to the upper rail.

    1. Time on lower rail before jumping up:
       - Prob to jump up at a step: p_up ~ 1 / (2 * exp(c))
       - Expected time on lower rail: T_lower = 1 / p_up = 2 * exp(c)
       - Expected displacement on lower rail: X_lower = 2 * exp(c)

    2. Excursion on upper rail:
       - An excursion consists of moving on the upper rail and dealing with potential traps.
       - Expected time for an excursion: E[T_excursion] ~ 4.5 + 2 * exp(c)
       - Expected displacement during an excursion: E[X_excursion] = 1.5

    3. Total cycle:
       - Total time: T_total = T_lower + E[T_excursion] ~ 2*exp(c) + 4.5 + 2*exp(c) = 4*exp(c) + 4.5
       - Total displacement: X_total = X_lower + E[X_excursion] ~ 2*exp(c) + 1.5

    4. Speed v(c):
       - v(c) = X_total / T_total = (2*exp(c) + 1.5) / (4*exp(c) + 4.5)

    5. Limit as c -> infinity:
       - lim v(c) = lim (2*exp(c)) / (4*exp(c)) = 2/4 = 1/2
