    # Information given from the problem statement:
    # 1. First two Laplacian eigenvalues are 0.0.
    #    This implies the number of connected components, k, is at least 2.
    
    # 2. null(B^T * B) = 2, where B is the incidence matrix.
    
    # Reasoning:
    # There is a common convention where the n x n graph Laplacian (L) is
    # defined as L = B^T * B, with B being the m x n (edges x vertices) incidence matrix.
    # Under this convention, the nullity of the Laplacian matrix is equal to the nullity of B^T * B.
    # null(L) = null(B^T * B)
    
    # The number of connected components 'k' of a graph is equal to the nullity of its Laplacian L.
    # k = null(L)
    
    # From the given information:
    nullity_BtB = 2
    
    # Combining the facts:
    # k = null(L) = null(B^T * B)
    k = nullity_BtB
    
    # The final equation determines the number of connected components:
    print("Let k be the number of connected components in the graph.")
    print("From the problem statement, we have the property null(B^T * B) = 2.")
    print("Using a standard definition where the Laplacian L = B^T * B, we get null(L) = 2.")
    print("Since k = null(L), we can deduce the final equation for k:")
    
    # The print statement below fulfills the requirement to "output each number in the final equation"
    print(f"k = {k}")
