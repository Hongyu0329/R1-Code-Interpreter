    Analyzes a set theory problem about the existence of a special function f
    depending on whether the infinite cardinal kappa is regular or singular.

    The problem states:
    Let kappa be an infinite cardinal and suppose there exists a kappa^+-Kurepa tree.
    Does there exist a function f : [kappa^{++}]^2 -> kappa such that for every
    x subset of kappa^{++} where the order type of x is kappa^+ + kappa,
    the image |f''[x]^2| has cardinality kappa?
