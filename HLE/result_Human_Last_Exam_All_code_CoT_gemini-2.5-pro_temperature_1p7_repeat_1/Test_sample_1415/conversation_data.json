    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integrand is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This form is a standard result from calculus. The integral of `u'(x)/u(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|u(x)| + C`. In our case, `u(x) = F₃(x)`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: We need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1. The result will be `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated at the limits `x=1` and `x=0`. This gives `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate F₃(1) and F₃(0)**:\n    *   **To find F₃(1):**\n        *   F₀(1) = 1\n        *   F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)\n        *   F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))\n        *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    *   **To find F₃(0):**\n        *   F₀(0) = 0\n        *   F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0\n        *   F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1\n        *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n    *   Since for x in [0, 1], `sin(x)` is non-negative, `e^(sin(x))` is greater than 1, so `F₃(x)` will always be positive. We can safely remove the absolute value signs.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Value V**: The value of the integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`. Using the properties of logarithms, this can be written as `V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The final step is to compute `10000 * V` and find the closest integer.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the values of F_3(x) at the integral limits x=1 and x=0.\n\n# Calculation for x = 1\nf3_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n# Calculation for x = 0\n# F_3(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\nf3_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# Step 2: The definite integral V is ln(F_3(1)) - ln(F_3(0)).\n# Using logarithm properties, V = ln(F_3(1) / F_3(0)).\nV = math.log(f3_1 / f3_0)\n\n# Step 3: The final requested value is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nrounded_value = round(final_value)\n\n# Step 4: Print the numbers involved in the final equation as requested.\nprint(\"--- Integral Evaluation ---\")\nprint(f\"The integral is evaluated as ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\nprint(\"The components of the final equation are:\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) = {f3_0}\")\nprint(f\"Value of the integral, V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)) = {V}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Answer Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"The target value is 10000 * V = {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {rounded_value}\")\n\n```\n<<<5490>>>"
