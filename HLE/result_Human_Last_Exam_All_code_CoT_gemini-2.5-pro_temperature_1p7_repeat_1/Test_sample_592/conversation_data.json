    "My plan is to first find the answer to the user's question about the movie *Ovosodo*. After a quick search, I found that the character Tommaso moves to New York City.\n\nSince the request requires a code-based solution, I will write a simple Python script. This script will store the name of the city in a variable and then use the `print()` function to display the answer in a full sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_us_city_in_ovosodo():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the US city\n    Tommaso moves to in the movie 'Ovosodo'.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"Ovosodo\"\n    character_name = \"Tommaso\"\n    us_city = \"New York City\"\n\n    print(f\"In the 1997 movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} moves to {us_city}.\")\n\nfind_us_city_in_ovosodo()\n```\n<<<New York City>>>"
