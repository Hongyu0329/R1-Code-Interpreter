    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system, which are the values of $P_i(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i$.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Set up the steady-state equations:** At steady state, the system is in equilibrium, which means the probabilities are constant. Therefore, their time derivatives are zero ($P_i'(t) = 0$). This converts the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations. It is important to note that there is a likely typo in the second provided equation for $P_1'(t)$. For the total probability to be conserved, the term corresponding to the transition from state 0 to 1 should be positive, i.e., $+\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$. Based on this correction, the resulting linear equations are:\n    *   $-\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3} = 0$\n2.  **Add the normalization condition:** The sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n    *   $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:** I will express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ using the first three equations. Then, I will substitute these expressions into the normalization equation to solve for the numerical value of $\\pi_1$.\n4.  **Calculate $\\pi_0$ and the final sum:** Once $\\pi_1$ is found, I can calculate $\\pi_0$. The final answer is the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# Step 2: Solve the system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities (pi_0, pi_1, pi_2, pi_3)\n# The equations are:\n# -lambda_01*pi_0 + lambda_10*pi_1 = 0                    => pi_0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * pi_1\n# lambda_12*pi_1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*pi_2 = 0      => pi_2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * pi_1\n# lambda_23*pi_2 - lambda_31*pi_3 = 0                    => pi_3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * pi_2\n# pi_0 + pi_1 + pi_2 + pi_3 = 1\n\n# Express pi_0, pi_2, pi_3 in terms of pi_1\n# Let's calculate the coefficients that relate them to pi_1\n# pi_0 = coeff_01 * pi_1\ncoeff_01 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n# pi_2 = coeff_21 * pi_1\ncoeff_21 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n# pi_3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * pi_2 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * coeff_21 * pi_1\ncoeff_31 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * coeff_21\n\n# Step 3: Use the normalization condition to find pi_1\n# pi_1 * (coeff_01 + 1 + coeff_21 + coeff_31) = 1\nsum_of_coeffs = coeff_01 + 1 + coeff_21 + coeff_31\npi_1 = 1 / sum_of_coeffs\n\n# Step 4: Calculate pi_0\npi_0 = coeff_01 * pi_1\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final requested sum pi_0 + pi_1\nresult = pi_0 + pi_1\n\n# Output the final equation with the calculated numbers\nprint(f\"The required sum is P0(+infinity) + P1(+infinity).\")\nprint(f\"The calculated steady-state probabilities are P0 = {pi_0} and P1 = {pi_1}.\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{pi_0} + {pi_1} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
