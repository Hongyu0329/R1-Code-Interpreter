    print("Let C_e be the connected component of the identity e in G.")
    print("The given property implies that int(C_e) is non-empty. In a topological group, a subgroup with a non-empty interior must be open (and also closed).")
    print("Therefore, C_e is an open and closed normal subgroup of G.")
