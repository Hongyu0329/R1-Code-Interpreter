    "To solve this problem, we will follow a multi-step process. The core of the task is to understand the definition of a \"generalized Markov number\" associated with a rational number and then perform the required computations.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Define the Generalized Markov Number**: A generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) associated with a rational number \\( r = p/q \\) (where \\(0 < r < 1\\)) is calculated based on its continued fraction. Let the continued fraction of \\( r \\) be \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] \\). The number \\( m_r \\) is defined as \\( x_{n+1} \\), where the sequence \\( x_i \\) follows the recurrence relation \\( x_{i+1} = a_i x_i - x_{i-1} \\), with initial conditions \\( x_0 = 0 \\) and \\( x_1 = 1 \\).\n\n2.  **Compute the Continued Fraction of 4/7**: First, we need to find the coefficients \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\) for the rational number 4/7.\n\n3.  **Calculate \\( m_{4/7} \\)**: Using the coefficients from the previous step, we will apply the recurrence relation to compute the value of the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n4.  **Find the Continued Fraction of the Result**: Finally, we will take the integer value of \\( m_{4/7} \\) and compute its own continued fraction, which is the final answer. The continued fraction of an integer `n` is simply `[n]`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, showing the calculations at each step and printing the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_continued_fraction_coeffs(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction coefficients [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] for a rational number p/q,\n    where it is assumed 0 < p/q < 1.
