    "I will solve this by writing a Python script to analyze the final chess position.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will use the `python-chess` library to represent the chessboard and game logic.\n2.  First, I'll load the provided game moves to reconstruct the exact position where it's Black's turn to move.\n3.  The task is to find the *shortest* mating sequence. I will start by searching for a \"mate in 1\". I will iterate through all of Black's legal moves and check if any of them result in an immediate checkmate.\n4.  If no mate in 1 is found, I will then search for a \"mate in 2\". This involves a deeper search:\n    *   I'll loop through each of Black's possible first moves.\n    *   For each move, I will assume it's played and then check every possible legal response from White.\n    *   If, after every one of White's possible responses, Black has a move that leads to checkmate, then the initial move by Black is the start of a forced mate sequence.\n5.  Once the correct starting move for the mating sequence is identified, I will determine the full sequence (Black's move, White's only reply, Black's final mating move) and format it as requested.\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport chess.pgn\nimport io\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chess position to find the shortest mating sequence for Black.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The PGN of the game leading to the position.\n    pgn_string = \"1. e4 c6 2. c4 e6 3.
