    Calculates the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap
    with a k-chain to one with a (k+1)-chain.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  At least one 'Insert' is needed to add the (k+1)-th item. After an Insert, the heap
        will have at least two trees.
    2.  The final state must be a single tree. Only 'Delete-min' can reduce the number of
        trees by consolidating the root list. Therefore, at least one 'Delete-min' is needed.
    3.  A simple sequence of 'Insert' and 'Delete-min' (2 operations) can be shown to fail
        to produce a single chain. The consolidation either leaves two trees or returns the
        heap to its original state.
    4.  Therefore, at least one more operation is needed to manipulate the heap into a state
        where consolidation can produce the desired result. A 'Decrease-key' operation can
        alter the tree structure by cutting nodes, providing the necessary capability for
        restructuring.
    5.  This leads to the conclusion that a minimum of 3 operations are needed: one 'Insert',
        one 'Decrease-key', and one 'Delete-min'. This count is constant and does not depend on k.
