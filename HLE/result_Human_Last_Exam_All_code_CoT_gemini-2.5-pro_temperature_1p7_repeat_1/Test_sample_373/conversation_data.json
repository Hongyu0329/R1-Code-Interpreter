    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Graph Structure**\nA barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by taking two complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge. To have a total of 10 nodes, each complete graph must have 5 nodes (K5). Let's call these two cliques `A` and `B`. The single edge connecting them, which we'll call `(u, v)`, is the \"bottleneck edge\". Here, node `u` is in clique `A` and node `v` is in clique `B`. The total number of nodes is `N = 10`.\n\n**2. Model the Gossiping Process**\nRandomized uniform gossiping works as follows:\n*   A node `i` is chosen uniformly at random from all `N` nodes. The probability of choosing any specific node is `1/N`.\n*   The chosen node `i` then selects one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random to communicate with. The probability of picking a neighbor `j` is `1/d(i)`, where `d(i)` is the degree (number of neighbors) of node `i`.\n\n**3. Identify the Key Nodes and Calculate Their Degrees**\nThe bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if node `u` is chosen and gossips to `v`, or if node `v` is chosen and gossips to `u`. To calculate this, we need the degrees of nodes `u` and `v`.\n*   **Degree of node `u`**: Node `u` is in a K5, so it's connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique. It's also connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge. Therefore, the degree of `u` is `d(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Degree of node `v`**: By symmetry, the degree of `v` is also `d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Probability**\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events:\n*   **Event 1**: Node `u` gossips to `v`.\n    *   Probability = `P(u is chosen) * P(u picks v) = (1/N) * (1/d(u))`\n*   **Event 2**: Node `v` gossips to `u`.\n    *   Probability = `P(v is chosen) * P(v picks u) = (1/N) * (1/d(v))`\n\nThe final probability is `P(Event 1) + P(Event 2)`. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # The graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (K5).\n    # We consider the two nodes that form the bottleneck edge.
