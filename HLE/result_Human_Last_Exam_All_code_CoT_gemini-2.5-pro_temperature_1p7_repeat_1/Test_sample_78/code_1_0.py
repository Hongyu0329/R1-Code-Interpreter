# The user wants to know if the Rust code will compile.
# I have analyzed the code and found a definitive borrow checker error.
# The `FeedForward::backward` method contains the following lines (or similar):
# self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...);
# self.w1.set(j, k, self.w1.get(j, k) - ...);
# This pattern violates Rust's borrowing rules because it attempts to immutably borrow `self.w2` (via .get())
# at the same time as mutably borrowing it (via .set()). This is not allowed.
# The compiler will issue an error.
#
# Additionally, the functions `exp` and `ln` are defined but never used, which
# will result in `dead_code` warnings.
#
# Therefore, the code will not compile, and it will have warnings. This corresponds to choice C.

# A correct implementation would separate the read from the write, like this:
# let old_w2_val = self.w2.get(j, k);
# let grad_update = learning_rate * gradients.get(i, k) * hidden_gradients.get(i, j);
# self.w2.set(j, k, old_w2_val - grad_update);
#
# Since the provided code does not do this, it will fail to compile.
