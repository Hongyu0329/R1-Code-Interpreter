def solve_quantum_symmetries_quiz():
    """
    Analyzes the statements about quantum symmetries and conservation laws
    and prints the sorted labels of the true statements.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A: False. Generators can have a continuous spectrum (e.g., momentum).
    B1: True. This connects scale invariance with the 1/r^2 potential, a standard result.
    B2: False. The scaling exponents derived from the generator τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂ do not match the statement.
    C: False. The condition [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0.
    D: True. If [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0, τ̂ maps energy eigenspaces to themselves.
    E: True. L̂_z is the generator of rotations about the z-axis.
    F: True. This is a statement of Noether's theorem via the Ehrenfest theorem.
    G: False. Commutativity of Ŝ(θ₁) and Ŝ(θ₂) is always true and does not imply τ̂ is Hermitian.
    H: False. Unbounded operators (like the harmonic oscillator's N̂) can have discrete spectra.
    I: True. This is a direct consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting generators.
    J: True. A symmetry operator maps an energy eigenstate to another eigenstate of the same energy.
