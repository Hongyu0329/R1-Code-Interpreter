# Plan:
# 1. The problem statement contains a logical contradiction where n=9, m=16, and h(G)=4 are mutually exclusive.
#    Analysis shows m=16 implies h(G)<=3.
# 2. To solve the problem, we must assume a typo. The most likely typo is m=16.
# 3. Assuming the 'Key Properties' are correct, we have two possibilities for partition sizes.
#    Case A: (2,2,3,2) which implies m=19.
#    Case B: (2,3,2,2) which implies m=18.
# 4. We will proceed with the assumption that the intended configuration was partition sizes n = (2, 3, 2, 2) and m=18.
# 5. Based on this corrected premise, we will calculate p, q, and r.
#    - p is the number of vertices in partitions S_i where the path length (n_i - 1) is odd.
#    - q is the size of the largest induced cycle containing a vertex from each S_i. We deduce this to be 5.
#    - r is the number of vertices with exactly 3 external neighbors. We deduce this to be 7.
# 6. Finally, we calculate the expression p + 2q + 3r.

# --- Calculation of p ---
# Partition sizes n = (n1, n2, n3, n4)
n_sizes = [2, 3, 2, 2]
# Path lengths are n_i - 1
path_lengths = [n - 1 for n in n_sizes]
# p is the sum of n_i for paths with odd length
p = 0
for i in range(len(n_sizes)):
    if path_lengths[i] % 2 != 0:
        p += n_sizes[i]

# --- Calculation of q ---
# Based on structural analysis, constructing an induced cycle of size 5 appears
# to be the maximum possible while satisfying the problem's constraints. A larger cycle
# is highly likely to contain chords.
q = 5

# --- Calculation of r ---
# r is the number of vertices v with exactly 3 neighbors in sets other than their own.
# A vertex v in S_i has deg_ext(v) = (i-1) + |N_forward(v)|.
# We need this to be 3.
# For v in S4: 3 + 0 = 3. All n4=2 vertices contribute.
# For v in S3: 2 + |N_f(v)| = 3 -> |N_f(v)|=1. We assume both n3=2 vertices fit this.
# For v in S2: 1 + |N_f(v)| = 3 -> |N_f(v)|=2. We assume 2 of n2=3 vertices fit this.
# For v in S1: 0 + |N_f(v)| = 3 -> |N_f(v)|=3. We assume 1 of n1=2 vertices fits this.
# Total r = r1+r2+r3+r4 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.
r = 7

# --- Final Expression ---
result = p + 2*q + 3*r
