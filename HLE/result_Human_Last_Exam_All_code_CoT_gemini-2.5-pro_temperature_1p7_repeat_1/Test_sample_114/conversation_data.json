    "To solve this, I will write a Python script that analyzes the text of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\".\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, the script will fetch the complete text of \"Book of the Duchess\" from the Project Gutenberg website.\n2.  Next, it will process this raw text to isolate the poem itself, removing headers and footers from the file. It will then clean up the text by splitting it into individual lines and removing any blank lines.\n3.  The script will then extract the last word from every line of the poem. These end-words will be cleaned by converting them to lowercase and removing any punctuation.\n4.  With this list of end-words, the script will iterate through the user-provided answer choices: 'Wente', 'Here', 'Fool', 'Hool', and 'Countour'.\n5.  For each word, the script will search for its occurrences in the list of end-words. When a match is found, it will examine the end-word of the preceding or succeeding line to check for a rhyming partner. Since \"Book of the Duchess\" is written in rhyming couplets, rhyming words should appear on adjacent lines.\n6.  Finally, the script will print a summary of its findings for each word and identify the one for which no rhyming partner was found in the text.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport string\n\ndef solve_chaucer_rhyme():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" to find which word from a list\n    is not used in a rhyme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
