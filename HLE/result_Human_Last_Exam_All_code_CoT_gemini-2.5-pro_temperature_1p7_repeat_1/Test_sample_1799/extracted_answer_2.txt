No, the second postulate is not considered superfluous. While one can formulate relativity in ways that make it seem like a consequence of other assumptions (like isotropy and homogeneity of spacetime), in Einstein's original and standard formulation, it is an essential and independent axiom. The first postulate alone is insufficient because it doesn't specify which transformation rules (Galilean or Lorentz) should be used to relate different inertial frames. Explicitly stating the constancy of the speed of light (Postulate 2) forces the rejection of Galilean transformations and leads directly to the physics of Special Relativity.
