# This program calculates the height of a palace with high accuracy
# and determines the memory used by the variables involved in the calculation.

# --- Inputs ---
# Angle to the top of the palace in degrees
angle_degrees = 40.0
# Distance to the center of the palace in meters
distance_meters = 100.0

# --- Calculation ---
# Step 1: Convert the angle from degrees to radians for the tan function.
angle_radians = math.radians(angle_degrees)

# Step 2: Calculate the tangent of the angle.
# The relationship in a right-angled triangle is tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent
# where 'opposite' is the height and 'adjacent' is the distance.
tangent_value = math.tan(angle_radians)

# Step 3: Calculate the height.
# height = distance * tan(angle)
height = distance_meters * tangent_value

# --- Output the equation and its components as requested ---
# The final equation is: height = distance * tan(angle)
print("The equation to calculate the height is:")
print(f"height = distance * tan(angle_in_degrees)")
print("\nPlugging in the numbers, the final equation is:")
print(f"{height} = {distance_meters} * tan({angle_degrees})")
print("\nTo solve this, we used the following numbers:")
print(f"The tangent of {angle_degrees} degrees is {tangent_value}.")
print(f"The final calculated height is {height} meters.")


# --- Memory Calculation ---
# We calculate the size in bytes for each variable used in the primary calculation.
# Note: In Python, the size of standard float objects is typically 24 bytes on a 64-bit system.
