    "Here is a plan to identify the island town:\n1.  Analyze the key clues from the riddle:\n    *   **Geography:** An island town on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   **Nomenclature:** The town and the bay share the same name.\n    *   **Location:** It is very remote, specified as being \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\".\n\n2.  Search for candidates based on extreme remoteness. The most isolated inhabited islands in the world include Easter Island (Rapa Nui), Tristan da Cunha, and the Pitcairn Islands.\n\n3.  Evaluate each candidate against the other clues:\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. It does not sit on a major bay, nor does it share a name with one.\n    *   **Pitcairn Islands:** The main settlement is Adamstown, located above Bounty Bay. The names do not match.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The main town is Hanga Roa. It sits on a bay named Hanga Roa Bay. The names match. Easter Island is a volcanic island, and the bay is situated between the Terevaka and Rano Kau volcanoes. It is also extremely isolated, being over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands and over 3,500 km from Chile.\n\n4.  Conclusion: Hanga Roa on Easter Island fits all the criteria provided in the question. The following Python code will print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the described island town.\n    The clues are:\n    1. An island town.\n    2. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island (very remote).\n    3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    4. The town and the bay share the same name.\n\n    The answer is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n    - It's the main town on the extremely remote Easter Island.\n    - The town of Hanga Roa is on Hanga Roa Bay.\n    - Easter Island is a volcanic island, and the bay lies between major volcanic features.\n    \"\"\"\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    print(town_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
