    "Of course, let's break down this E2 elimination reaction step by step.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**: I will identify the structure of the substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and the nature of the reagent, potassium tert-butoxide.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type**: Based on the substrate (secondary alkyl halide) and reagent (strong, bulky base), I'll determine that this is an E2 elimination reaction.\n3.  **Apply Stereochemical Rules for E2**: For an E2 reaction in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed must be in a *trans*-diaxial (anti-periplanar) arrangement.\n4.  **Evaluate Chair Conformations**: I will analyze the two chair conformations of the substrate. The (1S,2R) configuration indicates the bromo and methyl groups are *cis*. I'll determine which conformer has the necessary trans-diaxial arrangement for the reaction to proceed.\n5.  **Identify Potential Products**: From the reactive conformer, I will identify the possible elimination pathways. There are two types of beta-protons, leading to two possible alkene products: 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product) and 3-methylcyclohexene (the Hofmann product).\n6.  **Apply Regioselectivity Rules**: I will use the fact that potassium tert-butoxide is a sterically hindered (bulky) base, which favors the removal of the less sterically hindered proton. This leads to the formation of the Hofmann (less substituted) product as the major product.\n7.  **Final Answer**: I will state the name of the major product and print the numbers involved in the chemical names of the reactant and product as requested.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    reactant_name = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Reaction Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"The reaction involves treating {reactant_name} with {reagent}.\")\n    print(\"This is a classic E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Stereochemistry of E2 on Cyclohexane ---\")\n    print(\"A critical requirement for the E2 mechanism on a cyclohexane ring is that the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton (H on an adjacent carbon) must be in a trans-diaxial orientation (180 degrees apart).\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Substrate Conformation ---\")\n    print(f\"In {reactant_name}, the '(1S,2R)' configuration means the bromo and methyl groups are cis to each other.\")\n    print(\"Of the two possible chair conformations, only the one where the Bromine atom is in an axial position can undergo the E2 reaction.\")\n    print(\"In this reactive conformer, the bulkier methyl group is in the more stable equatorial position.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Regioselectivity: Zaitsev vs. Hofmann ---\")\n    print(\"From the reactive conformer (axial Br), elimination can occur in two ways:\")\n    print(\"1.
