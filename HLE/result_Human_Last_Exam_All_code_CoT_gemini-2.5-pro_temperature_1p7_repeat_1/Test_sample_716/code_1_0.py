def solve_hausdorff_dimension():
    """
    This function explains and calculates the Hausdorff dimension for the given curve.

    The curve is parametrized by:
    x(t) = sin(pi * t)
    y(t) = sin(t)
    z(t) = cos(2t)

    A key theorem in fractal geometry states that the Hausdorff dimension of any
    smooth (continuously differentiable, C^1) curve is 1, provided the curve is
    not a single point.

    A curve is smooth if the derivatives of its component functions exist and are continuous.
    Let's check the derivatives:
    - d/dt [sin(pi * t)] = pi * cos(pi * t)
    - d/dt [sin(t)]     = cos(t)
    - d/dt [cos(2t)]    = -2 * sin(2t)

    All these derivatives are continuous functions. Therefore, the curve is smooth.
    As the curve is not a single static point, its Hausdorff dimension is 1.
