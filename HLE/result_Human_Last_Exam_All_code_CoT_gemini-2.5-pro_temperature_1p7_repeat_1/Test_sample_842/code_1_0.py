    Solves for the polynomial f(t) using symbolic matrix algebra.
    The steps are:
    1. Define the Burau representation matrices for B_3 generators.
    2. Compute the matrix for the braid beta.
    3. Calculate det(I - rho(beta)) and relate it to the given denominator.
    4. Calculate the BLM/Ho polynomial Q(t) using the trace formula.
    5. Determine f(t) from the relation f(t) = t^2 * Q(t).
