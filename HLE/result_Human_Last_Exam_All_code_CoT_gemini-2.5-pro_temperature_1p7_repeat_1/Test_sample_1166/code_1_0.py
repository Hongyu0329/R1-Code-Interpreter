    """
    Analyzes a list of function types and determines which are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    A function f is Lebesgue integrable if:
    1. f is measurable.
    2. The integral of its absolute value is finite (∫|f|dμ < ∞).

    Analysis summary:
    A. Bounded function: Fails (not always measurable).
    B. Bounded measurable function: Fails (domain measure can be infinite, e.g., f(x)=1 on R).
    C. Measurable function: Fails (unbounded or infinite measure domain).
    D. Continuous function: Fails (infinite measure domain, e.g., f(x)=1 on R).
    E. Measurable function on [a,b]: Fails (can be unbounded, e.g., f(x)=1/x on [0,1]).
    F. Continuous function on [a,b]: TRUE. (Continuous on compact set is bounded and measurable).
    G. Bounded function on [a,b]: Fails (not always measurable).
    H. Function whose |f| is integrable: Fails (f itself is not necessarily measurable).
    I. Function whose |f| is integrable on [a,b]: Fails (f itself is not necessarily measurable).
    J. Continuous function on (a,b): Fails (can be unbounded near endpoints).
    H(2). Bounded function on (a,b): Fails (not always measurable).
    K. Measurable function on (a,b): Fails (can be unbounded).
    L. Measurable function whose |f| is integrable: TRUE. (This is the definition of Lebesgue integrable).
    M. Bounded continuous function on (a,b): TRUE. (Measurable, bounded, on a finite measure domain).

    The correct choices are F, L, and M.
