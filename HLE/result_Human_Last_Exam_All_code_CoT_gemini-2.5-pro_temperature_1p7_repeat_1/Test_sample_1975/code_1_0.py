# The problem asks for the order type of a set of cardinals, X.
# Through set-theoretic analysis, we determined that X contains all
# infinite cardinals less than or equal to kappa = omega_7.
# The infinite cardinals are indexed by the natural numbers,
# starting from omega_0 (which is omega).
# The cardinals in X are therefore omega_0, omega_1, ..., omega_7.
# To find the order type of this set, we count its elements.
# The indices range from 0 to 7.
max_index = 7
min_index = 0

# The number of elements is calculated as max_index - min_index + 1.
# The order type of a finite, ordered set is its cardinality.
order_type = max_index - min_index + 1

# Final equation for the order type.
print(f"{max_index} - {min_index} + 1 = {order_type}")
