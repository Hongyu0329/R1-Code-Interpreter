    "I will scan the provided Latin hexameter line by breaking it down into six feet, explaining the metrical quantity of each syllable (long or short) and identifying any elisions or special metrical features.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Syllabify and Identify Elisions**: I will break the line into syllables and identify where a word ending in a vowel or '-m' is followed by a word starting with a vowel or 'h'. These result in elision, where the first syllable is dropped for metrical purposes.\n    *   `verum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides.\n    *   `ubi equi`: The `-i` of `ubi` elides.\n    *   `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides.\n    *   `convenit imago`: Here, a special elision called prodelision (or aphaeresis) likely occurs, where the initial `i-` of `imago` is dropped after the final `-t` of `convenit`.\n2.  **Determine Syllable Quantity**: I'll determine if each syllable is long (–) or short (u) based on these rules:\n    *   **Long by nature**: The vowel is inherently long (e.g., `ī`, `ā`, `ō`) or is a diphthong (e.g., `ae`, `au`).\n    *   **Long by position**: A short vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or a double consonant (`x`, `z`).\n    *   **Short**: All other syllables containing a short vowel.\n3.  **Group into Feet**: I will group the syllables into six metrical feet. Each foot is either a dactyl (– u u) or a spondee (– –). The fifth foot is typically a dactyl, and the sixth is always treated as a spondee.\n4.  **Assemble the final scansion**: I'll present the line with divisions for each foot and then the corresponding sequence of \"D\" for dactyl and \"S\" for spondee.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    This function explains the scansion step-by-step and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    print(f\"Scanning line: {line}\\n\")\n    \n    # Detailed breakdown of the scansion process\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\\n\")\n    \n    # Foot 1\n    print(\"Foot 1: 'verum ubi e-'\")\n    print(\"  - Syllables: ver- | u | e\")\n    print(\"  - 'ver-': Long by position (the 'e' is followed by 'r' and 'm').\")\n    print(\"  - The syllable '-um' of 'verum' is elided before 'ubi'.\")\n    print(\"  - 'u': The 'u' from 'ubi' is short by nature.\")\n    print(\"  - The syllable '-bi' of 'ubi' is elided before 'equi'.\")\n    print(\"  - 'e': The 'e' from 'equi' is short by nature.\")\n    print(\"  - Pattern: Long, Short, Short => Dactyl (D)\\n\")\n    \n    # Foot 2\n    print(\"Foot 2: '-qui atque'\")\n    print(\"  - Syllables: qui | at-\")\n    print(\"  - '-qui': The 'i' in 'equi' (genitive 'equī') is long by nature.\")\n    print(\"  - 'at-': Long by position (the 'a' is followed by 't' and 'qu').\")\n    print(\"  - The syllable '-que' of 'atque' is elided before 'hominis'.\")\n    print(\"  - Pattern: Long, Long => Spondee (S)\\n\")\n\n    # Foot 3\n    print(\"Foot 3: 'hominis'\")\n    print(\"  - Syllables: ho- | mi- | nis\")\n    print(\"  - 'ho-': The 'o' is naturally short.
