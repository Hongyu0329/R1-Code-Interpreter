    "To find the total welfare, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the Market Equilibrium:** The market is in equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_e`). At this point, the price from the supply function also equals the price from the demand function (`P_S = P_D = P_e`). We find the equilibrium quantity `Q_e` by setting the two equations equal to each other: `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. This equation is complex and will be solved numerically.\n\n2.  **Calculate Equilibrium Price:** Once we have the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`, we can find the equilibrium price `P_e` by substituting `Q_e` back into either the supply or demand function.\n\n3.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** Consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price line. It's calculated by the integral of the demand function from 0 to `Q_e`, minus the rectangle `P_e * Q_e`.\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (P_e * Q_e)`\n\n4.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price line. It's calculated as the rectangle `P_e * Q_e` minus the integral of the supply function. The lower bound of this integral is the minimum quantity at which supply is defined (i.e., where `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, so `Q > 2^(1/3)`).\n    `PS = (P_e * Q_e) - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_e] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus: `Total Welfare = CS + PS`.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps using the `scipy` library for numerical solving and integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the supply and demand functions\n    # Supply: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\n    def supply_func(q):\n        # The argument of ln must be > 0. Q^3 - 2 > 0 => Q > 2^(1/3)\n        # We add a small epsilon to avoid issues at the boundary for the solver.\n        if np.any(q**3 - 2 <= 1e-9):\n            return np.inf # Return a large value if Q is out of domain\n        return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\n    # Demand: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\n    def demand_func(q):\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    # --- 1.

Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS) ---\n    # CS = Integral(Demand(Q) dQ) from 0 to Q_e - P_e * Q_e\n    integral_demand, _ = quad(demand_func, 0, Q_e)\n    consumer_surplus = integral_demand - (P_e * Q_e)\n\n    # --- 4. Calculate Producer Surplus (PS) ---\n    # PS = P_e * Q_e - Integral(Supply(Q) dQ) from Q_min to Q_e\n    # Find Q_min: Q^3 - 2 > 0 => Q > 2^(1/3)\n    Q_min = 2**(1/3)\n    integral_supply, _ = quad(supply_func, Q_min, Q_e)\n    producer_surplus = (P_e * Q_e) - integral_supply\n\n    # --- 5. Calculate Total Welfare ---\n    total_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\n    # Print the final equation with the calculated values\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\")\n    print(f\"Total Welfare = {consumer_surplus:.4f} + {producer_surplus:.4f} = {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<16.8209>>>"
