    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I will explain the relevant crystallographic concepts: wallpaper groups, point groups, and the \"order\" of a group.\n2.  I will identify which of the 2D crystallographic point groups have an order of 2.\n3.  Then, I will provide a Python script that systematically counts the number of wallpaper groups associated with each of these point groups.\n4.  The script will store the mapping of the 17 wallpaper groups to their respective point groups.\n5.  It will then iterate through this data, count the relevant groups, and print out the individual counts followed by the final equation and the total number, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the answer:\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_wallpaper_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In crystallography, there are 17 wallpaper groups (2D plane symmetry groups).\n    # Each wallpaper group is associated with one of 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups.\n    # The 'order' of a point group is the number of symmetry elements it contains.\n\n    # Data mapping the 17 wallpaper groups (IUC notation) to their point groups (Sch√∂nflies notation).\n    wallpaper_to_point_group = {\n        'p1': 'C1', 'p2': 'C2', 'pm': 'D1', 'pg': 'D1', 'cm': 'D1',\n        'pmm': 'D2', 'pmg': 'D2', 'pgg': 'D2', 'cmm': 'D2', 'p3': 'C3',\n        'p3m1': 'D3', 'p31m': 'D3', 'p4': 'C4', 'p4m': 'D4', 'p4g': 'D4',\n        'p6': 'C6', 'p6m': 'D6'\n    }\n\n    # The order of each of the 10 2D point groups.\n    # We are interested in point groups of order 2. These are C2 and D1.\n    point_group_orders = {\n        'C1': 1, 'C2': 2, 'D1': 2, 'C3': 3, 'C4': 4,\n        'D2': 4, 'C6': 6, 'D3': 6, 'D4': 8, 'D6': 12\n    }\n    \n    # We will count how many wallpaper groups belong to each point group of order 2.\n    groups_by_point_group_order_2 = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    for wg, pg in wallpaper_to_point_group.items():\n        if point_group_orders.get(pg) == 2:\n            groups_by_point_group_order_2[pg].append(wg)\n\n    print(\"The point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1.\")\n    print(\"The wallpaper groups associated with these point groups are:\")\n    \n    counts = []\n    # Print the counts for each relevant point group.\n    for pg in sorted(groups_by_point_group_order_2.keys()):\n        count = len(groups_by_point_group_order_2[pg])\n        counts.append(count)\n        group_list_str = \", \".join(sorted(groups_by_point_group_order_2[pg]))\n        print(f\"- There are {count} groups with point group {pg}: {group_list_str}\")\n\n    # Display the final calculation as an equation.\n    total = sum(counts)\n    equation_parts = [str(c) for c in counts]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total}\")\n\nsolve_wallpaper_groups()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
