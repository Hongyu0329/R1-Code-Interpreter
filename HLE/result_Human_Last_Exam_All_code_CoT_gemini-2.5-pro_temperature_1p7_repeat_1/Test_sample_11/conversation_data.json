    "My plan is to identify the first major Israeli law that codified the principle of \"good faith\" as a central tenet of civil law. I will search my knowledge base for this specific statute. Then, I will create a Python script to print the name of this law, ensuring the output does not include the word \"the\" or the year, as per your instructions.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the first statute in the modern State of Israel\n# that is widely recognized for explicitly introducing the concept of \"good faith\"\n# as a general, overriding principle in civil law.\n\nstatute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\"?
