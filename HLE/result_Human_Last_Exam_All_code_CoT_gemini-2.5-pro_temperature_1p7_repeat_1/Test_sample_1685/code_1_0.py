# Based on the analytical derivation, the asymptotic solution for y(x)
# for large x follows the form y(x) = A * x^p.

# The dominant balance analysis on the ODE yields the simplified equation y''' ≈ y^4.
# Substituting y(x) = A * x^p into this simplified equation allows us to
# determine the values of p and A.
# Equating the powers of x gives: p - 3 = 4*p, which solves to p = -1.
# Equating the coefficients gives: A*p*(p-1)*(p-2) = A^4.
# Substituting p = -1, we get: A*(-1)*(-2)*(-3) = A^4, which simplifies to -6*A = A^4.
# For a non-trivial solution (A ≠ 0), we find A^3 = -6.

# We now calculate the numerical value for the coefficient A.
A = np.cbrt(-6)

# The problem asks to round the result to two decimal places.
A_rounded = round(A, 2)
p = -1

# The following lines will output each number required for the final equation,
# and then the assembled equation itself.
