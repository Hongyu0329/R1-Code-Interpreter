  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The problem asks for the maximum length of a secret message that can be encoded using the symbols from the \"Ching\" book. This is an information theory problem, fundamentally about base conversion.\n2.  **Analyze the Information Source (Ching):**\n    *   The Ching's symbols are composed of a 'yinyang' part (2 states: yin, yang) and a 'wuxing' part (5 states: wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   The total number of unique symbols is the product of these states: 2 * 5 = 10. This is the base of our source information.\n    *   The book contains 9999 of these symbols. This is the length of our source information sequence.\n    *   The total number of distinct possible Ching books is 10^9999.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Message Alphabet (Shu):**\n    *   The secret message is written using characters from the Shu.\n    *   The problem states the alphabet for this message consists of 120 unique characters. This is the base of our target message.\n\n4.  **Set up the Information Equation:**\n    *   Let 'L' be the maximum length of the secret message.\n    *   The information contained in the message (120^L possible variations) cannot exceed the information contained in the source Ching book (10^9999 possible variations).\n    *   This gives us the inequality: `120^L <= 10^9999`.\n\n5.  **Solve for L:**\n    *   To solve for the exponent L, we take the logarithm of both sides of the inequality. Using log base 10 is convenient.\n    *   `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n    *   `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n    *   Since `log10(10) = 1`, this simplifies to: `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n    *   `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Calculate the value of `9999 / log10(120)`.\n    *   Since the message length 'L' must be an integer, the maximum possible length is the floor of the calculated value (the largest integer less than or equal to the result).\n\nI will now provide the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_message_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum length of a secret message based on information theory principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters from the problem description\n    num_yinyang_states = 2\n    num_wuxing_states = 5\n    ching_sequence_length = 9999\n    shu_alphabet_size = 120\n    \n    # Calculate the alphabet size of the Ching's symbols\n    ching_alphabet_size = num_yinyang_states * num_wuxing_states\n    \n    print(\"This problem can be solved by comparing the information capacity of the source (Ching) and the message (written in Shu characters).\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
