# The space is the k-dimensional unit cube, X = [0,1]^k.
# In this problem, the dimension k is 3.
k = 3

# According to a known theorem in topology, the n-compactness number for
# the k-dimensional cube [0,1]^k is given by the formula k + 1.
result = k + 1

# We print the calculation to show how the final answer is derived.
