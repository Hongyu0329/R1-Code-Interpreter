    "My analysis of John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*, reveals that Milton, a 17th-century Puritan, held views critical of the Roman Catholic Church and its veneration of saints. As such, the poem contains very few references to post-biblical, historical saints.\n\nThe most direct reference occurs in Book III, in a section known as the \"Paradise of Fools.\" Here, Milton satirizes those he believed sought salvation through misguided works and superstitions. He explicitly names the founders of two major Catholic mendicant orders in this critique.\n\nMy search of the poem's text and consultation of literary scholarship confirms that these are the only figures who fit the description of \"historical saints\" mentioned by name. Biblical figures (like Peter or Moses) and angelic beings (like Michael or Uriel) are not included in this count.\n\nThe Python code below will list the saints found and print the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's \"Paradise Lost\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on literary analysis of \"Paradise Lost\", specifically Book III, lines 476-479,\n    # Milton mentions the founders of two monastic orders in a critical passage.\n    # These are St. Dominic (founder of the Dominicans) and St. Francis of Assisi (founder of the Franciscans).\n    saints_mentioned = [\"Dominic\", \"Francis\"]\n    \n    # Get the total count\n    number_of_saints = len(saints_mentioned)\n    \n    print(\"The historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's 'Paradise Lost' are:\")\n    for saint in saints_mentioned:\n        print(f\"- {saint}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nThis reference appears in Book III where Milton criticizes those who, in his view, mistakenly believe they can enter heaven through the works of monastic orders.\")\n    \n    # Fulfilling the requirement to output an 'equation' for the count.\n    # We represent each found saint as a '1'.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in saints_mentioned]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculation for the total count is: {equation_str} = {number_of_saints}\")\n\n# Run the function to display the results\ncount_saints_in_paradise_lost()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
