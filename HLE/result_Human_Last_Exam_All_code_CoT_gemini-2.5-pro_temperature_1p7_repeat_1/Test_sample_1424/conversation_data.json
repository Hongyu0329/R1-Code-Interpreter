    "In the context of the Feynman path integral formalism, especially when applied to many-body systems, the Green's function is most conveniently expressed in frequency-momentum space. The bare Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will explain the origin of the relationship between the bare Green's function $G_0$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  The fundamental relationship in frequency ($\\omega$) and momentum ($k$) space is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$.\n3.  However, to ensure correct causality (i.e., particles propagate forward in time), a small imaginary term, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta$ is a small positive real number), is added to the denominator. This displaces the pole from the real axis and is a key feature of the Feynman prescription.\n4.  The final functional form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$.\n5.  I will write a Python script that defines sample values for $\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, and $\\eta$, and then calculates the value of the bare Green's function, printing out the formula with the specific numbers used.\n\nThis script will computationally demonstrate the functional dependence of $G_0$ on $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 in frequency-momentum space.\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency variable.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        eta (float): A small positive infinitesimal for the Feynman prescription.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The functional dependence is G_0 = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iη)\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    g0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy ε_k is given by:\")\n    print(\"G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iη)\")\n    print(\"\\nwhere:\")\n    print(\"  ω: frequency\")\n    print(\"  ε_k: single-particle energy eigenvalue for momentum k\")\n    print(\"  iη: a small imaginary part to ensure causality (Feynman prescription)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Outputting each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(\"Let's calculate for a sample set of values:\")\n    print(f\"ω = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"ε_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"η = {eta}\")\n    print(\"\\nPlugging the numbers into the equation:\")\n    # The final equation with each number explicitly shown\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{eta})\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {g0}\")\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\n# Define sample values for the variables\n# Let's choose a frequency 'omega' close to the particle energy 'epsilon_k'\n# to see a significant response.\nomega_val = 2.5\nepsilon_k_val = 2.4\n\n# Calculate and display the result\ncalculate_bare_greens_function(omega_val, epsilon_k_val)\n\n```\n<<<In frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The specific functional form, including the Feynman prescription for causality, is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, where $\\eta$ is a small positive infinitesimal.>>>"
