    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, we need to count the distinct genes that encode these microRNAs. Based on current biological databases and scientific literature, the family is composed of several members, some of which are encoded by multiple genes.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will list the different let-7 family members and the count of their corresponding genes. The main members are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, and let-7i.\n2.  Some of these, like let-7a and let-7f, are encoded by multiple genes.\n3.  Additionally, other microRNAs like miR-98 and miR-202 are considered part of the let-7 family due to sequence and functional similarities.\n4.  I will write a Python script that stores these counts in a dictionary.\n5.  The script will then construct and print an equation showing how the total number is calculated from these individual counts, and finally, it will print the result.\n\n```python\ndef count_human_let7_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of human let-7 family members.\n    The let-7 family is a group of microRNAs. The total count is based on the number of\n    distinct genes encoding these miRNAs in the human genome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each let-7 family member to its number of encoding genes in humans.\n    # This includes closely related members like miR-98 and miR-202.\n    let7_members = {\n        \"let-7a\": 3,\n        \"let-7b\": 1,\n        \"let-7c\": 1,\n        \"let-7d\": 1,\n        \"let-7e\": 1,\n        \"let-7f\": 2,\n        \"let-7g\": 1,\n        \"let-7i\": 1,\n        \"miR-98\": 1,\n        \"miR-202\": 1\n    }\n\n    # Get the counts for each member\n    counts = list(let7_members.values())\n    total_members = sum(counts)\n\n    # Create the equation string\n    equation = \" + \".join(map(str, counts))\n\n    print(f\"To date, the number of human let-7 family members (genes) can be calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{equation} = {total_members}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis count includes:\")\n    for member, count in let7_members.items():\n        print(f\"- {count} gene(s) for {member}\")\n\ncount_human_let7_members()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
