    # Step 1: Define Liveness and Safety
    print("1. Defining Key Concepts:")
    print("   - Liveness: Guarantees that the system eventually makes progress. In a blockchain, this means valid transactions will eventually be included in a block.")
    print("   - Safety: Guarantees that nothing bad happens. In a blockchain, this means the confirmed state of the ledger is correct, and valid transactions are immutable.\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze the impact on Liveness
    print("2. Analyzing Liveness:")
    print("   - The scenario is: 'no transaction has been included for 1 day'.")
    print("   - A blockchain's purpose is to process transactions. If it fails to do this for a day, it is not making progress.")
    print("   - This is a clear violation of the liveness property.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Liveness is for sure broken.\n")

    # Step 3: Analyze the impact on Safety
    print("3. Analyzing Safety:")
    print("   - A halt in progress (no new blocks/transactions) does not automatically mean the existing data is corrupted or incorrect.")
    print("   - The historical ledger can remain perfectly valid and immutable even if the network stops producing new blocks.")
    print("   - Therefore, the system's safety is not necessarily broken. It might be, due to the same underlying cause, but a halt in progress itself is not a safety failure.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Safety may not be broken.\n")
    
    # Step 4: Final Conclusion
    print("4. Final Conclusion:")
    print("   - Combining the analysis, it is for sure that liveness is broken, but safety may not be broken.")
    print("   - This corresponds to option B.\n")
