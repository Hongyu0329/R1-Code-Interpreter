    "To find the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$), we follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Branch Points**: The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. Its singularities in the reduction are determined by how the branch points cluster together in the 2-adic metric. The branch points are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$, plus the point at infinity.\n2.  **Analyze the Roots**: We can factor out $x$ from $f(x)$, so one branch point is $b_0 = 0$. The other finite branch points are the roots of the quartic polynomial $g(x) = f(x)/x = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\n3.  **Determine Root Valuations**: We will use the Newton polygon of $g(x)$ with respect to the prime $p=2$ to determine the 2-adic valuations of its roots. The 2-adic valuation $v_2(n)$ of an integer $n$ is the highest power of 2 that divides $n$.\n4.  **Cluster the Branch Points**: Branch points are grouped into \"clusters\" if they are close 2-adically. Two branch points $b_i$ and $b_j$ are in the same cluster if the valuation of their difference, $v_2(b_i - b_j)$, is positive.\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Double Points**: The total number of double points in the stable reduction is the sum of contributions from each cluster. For a cluster containing only two branch points, $\\{b_i, b_j\\}$, the number of double points it contributes is $v_2(b_i - b_j) - 1$. Singleton clusters do not contribute any double points. We will find all such clusters and sum their contributions.\n\n### Execution:\n\nThe python code below carries out this analysis. It first computes the 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $g(x)$, determines the valuations of the roots from the Newton Polygon, identifies the clusters of branch points, and then calculates the number of double points based on the formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    if n % p != 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 + get_valuation(n // p, p)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 2\n    # The curve is y^2 = f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x.\n    # One branch point is at x=0.
