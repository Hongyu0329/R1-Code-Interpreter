# Constants given in the problem
L = 24

# We determined that k=25 is the smallest plausible integer that satisfies the problem's structural requirements.
# k-1 must be a divisor of 48, and k must be odd for the minimal N construction,
# or k must be even for another construction.
# Testing k=25 (odd) led to N=624.
# Testing k=26 (even) led to N=675.
# Minimal N is likely achieved at k=25.
k = 25

# Based on k=25, we find the minimal size N.
# N must be a multiple of L*(k+1) and a multiple of some a_i*(k-1) where a_i>=L
# The minimum N is achieved when we have equality, which led to N = L * (k+1)
# with cluster sizes |B_j|=L and |A_i|=L + 2L/(k-1)
N = L * (k + 1)
num_A_clusters = k - 1
num_B_clusters = k + 1

# Check the sizes of the clusters
size_A_clusters = N // num_A_clusters
size_B_clusters = N // num_B_clusters

# The value we are looking for is min(w_C) where w_C is the maximum overlap
# max |A_i intersect B_j|.
# This value is minimized when the overlaps are as evenly distributed as possible.
# The average overlap is the total number of points divided by the number of intersections.
average_overlap = N / (num_A_clusters * num_B_clusters)

# The result is the value of the minimum maximum overlap.
# Since the average is an integer, a perfectly balanced configuration is possible.
# Thus, the minimum possible maximum overlap is equal to the average.
min_w_C = average_overlap
