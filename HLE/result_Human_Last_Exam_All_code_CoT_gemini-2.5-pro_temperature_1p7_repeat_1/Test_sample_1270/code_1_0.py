# The fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene" is interpreted as a central
# benzene ring with three substituents that form the shape of the Mercedes-Benz logo.
# The most elegant chemical representation is 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene, where
# three phenyl (benzene) rings are attached to a central benzene ring.

# Number of carbons in the central benzene ring.
carbons_in_central_ring = 6

# The Mercedes logo has 3 points, so we have 3 substituent groups.
number_of_substituents = 3

# Each substituent is a phenyl group (a benzene ring), which has 6 carbons.
carbons_per_substituent = 6

# Calculate the total number of carbon atoms.
total_carbons = carbons_in_central_ring + number_of_substituents * carbons_per_substituent

# Print the final equation showing all the components.
