    Calculates the infimum exponent c for the runtime O(n^c) of the (1,lambda) EA on CLIFF_{3/4}.

    The derivation shows that the runtime is composed of two main phases:
    1. T_climb: Time to reach the local optimum at |x|_1 = 3n/4.
    2. T_jump: Time to jump from the local optimum to the global optimum.

    T_climb for the (1,lambda) EA on a OneMax-like landscape is O(n*log(n) + lambda*n).
    T_jump can be made negligible by choosing lambda appropriately (lambda = Theta(n)),
    based on advanced theoretical results for Cliff functions.

    With lambda = Theta(n), T_climb becomes O(n*log(n) + n*n) = O(n^2).
    The total runtime is dominated by the climbing phase.
    Therefore, the overall runtime complexity is O(n^2).
