    "To determine which Turing Machine halts after the most steps, I will simulate each one starting from an empty tape (all zeros) and state 'A'. I need a program that can correctly interpret the rules and track the state of the machine over time.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Parse the Rules:** For each machine, I will parse the given compact string into a more usable data structure, like a dictionary. The rules are ordered by state (A, B, C, D, E) and then by the symbol read (0, 1). For example, the first 3 characters `B1L` correspond to the transition for state 'A' reading '0': change to state 'B', write '1', and move Left.\n2.  **Turing Machine Simulator:** I will create a core simulation function. This function will initialize the machine's state:\n    *   An infinite tape, represented by a dictionary or a `defaultdict` to handle the initially blank cells.\n    *   The head position, starting at 0.\n    *   The current state, starting at 'A'.\n    *   A step counter, starting at 0.\n3.  **Execute Simulation:** The simulator will run in a loop, performing the following actions at each step:\n    *   Read the symbol from the tape at the current head position.\n    *   Look up the corresponding rule based on the current state and the symbol read.\n    *   Update the tape by writing the new symbol.\n    *   Update the head's position by moving left or right.\n    *   Change to the next state.\n    *   Increment the step counter.\n4.  **Halt Condition:** The simulation for a machine stops when it enters the 'H' (Halt) state. I will also include a maximum step limit to prevent getting stuck in an infinite loop for any non-halting machines.\n5.  **Compare Results:** After running the simulation for all three machines, I will compare the number of steps each took to halt. The machine with the highest step count is the answer.\n\nI will now proceed with the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef parse_rules(rule_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a compact Turing machine rule string into a nested dictionary.\n    The format is {'State': {read_symbol: (next_state, write_symbol, move_direction)}}.\n    \"\"\"\n    rules = {}\n    states = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n    for i in range(10):  # 10 rules total for 5 states and 2 symbols\n        # Each rule is a 3-character chunk (e.g., 'B1L')\n        rule_chunk = rule_string[i*3 : i*3 + 3]\n        \n        # Determine the current state and symbol this rule applies to\n        state_name = states[i // 2]\n        symbol_read = i % 2\n\n        if state_name not in rules:\n            rules[state_name] = {}\n\n        # Extract the transition details\n        next_state = rule_chunk[0]\n        write_symbol = int(rule_chunk[1])\n        move_direction = rule_chunk[2]\n\n        rules[state_name][symbol_read] = (next_state, write_symbol, move_direction)\n    return rules\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rule_string, machine_name, max_steps=500):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a Turing machine on an empty tape.\n    Returns the number of steps until it halts or an indicator for non-halting.\n    \"\"\"\n    rules = parse_rules(rule_string)\n    tape = defaultdict(int)  # The tape is infinite and initialized with 0s\n    state = 'A'              # Initial state\n    head_pos = 0             # Initial head position\n    steps = 0\n\n    while state != 'H' and steps < max_steps:\n        # Read the symbol on the tape at the current head position\n        symbol_read = tape[head_pos]\n\n        # Get the transition rule for the current state and symbol\n        if state not in rules or symbol_read not in rules[state]:\n            print(f\"Machine {machine_name}: Undefined transition for state '{state}' reading '{symbol_read}'.
