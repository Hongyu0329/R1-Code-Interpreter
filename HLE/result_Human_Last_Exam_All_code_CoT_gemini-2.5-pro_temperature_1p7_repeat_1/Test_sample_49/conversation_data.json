    "This is a problem in combinatorial geometry. To solve it, we need to find the f-vector, which is $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$, for a specific type of 4-dimensional polytope.\n\nHere is my plan to find the f-vector:\n1.  We are given the number of vertices, $f_0 = 6$, and the dimension, $d = 4$.\n2.  The Upper Bound Theorem for convex polytopes states that the maximum possible number of faces of any dimension for a polytope with $v$ vertices is achieved by the simplicial cyclic polytope.\n3.  First, I will calculate the f-vector for the cyclic 4-polytope with 6 vertices, $C(6,4)$. This will give us the maximum possible value for $f_2$ (the number of 2-faces).\n4.  To do this, I will first calculate the h-vector of this polytope, which is a known formula for neighborly polytopes like the cyclic polytope. The h-vector is $(h_0, h_1, h_2, h_3, h_4)$.\n5.  Then, I will use the relationships between the h-vector and the f-vector to calculate the values of $f_0, f_1, f_2$, and $f_3$.\n6.  The result will be the f-vector for the simplicial polytope that maximizes the face numbers. I will then explain why a non-simplicial polytope can achieve this same maximal number of 2-faces. In fact, a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and this exact f-vector is known to exist.\n7.  Finally, I will present the f-vector and verify it using Euler's polyhedral formula for 4-polytopes: $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_f_vector():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices\n    and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
