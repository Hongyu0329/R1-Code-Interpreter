    # C_9: Candidates {25-28} approved by voter 9
    # C_10: Candidates {29-32} approved by voter 10

    # A committee W is in the core only if it cannot be "blocked" by a coalition of voters.
    # The group N={1..8} is a strong coalition that agrees on C_common={1..8}.
    # If a committee W does not contain all candidates from C_common, this coalition
    # can propose a new committee W' that is strictly better for most of them, blocking W.
    # Therefore, any committee W_1 in the core must contain all 8 candidates in C_common.
    
    # To minimize s(N, W_1), we must select the remaining 12 candidates (20 - 8)
    # to have the least overlap with candidates approved by voters in N.
    # This means we should select candidates from C_9 and C_10 first.
    # W_1 will contain:
    # - C_common (8 candidates)
    # - C_9 (4 candidates)
    # - C_10 (4 candidates)

    # = 64 + sum_{i=1 to 8} |C_i_unique intersect W_1_unique_part|

    # Step 3: Analyze EJR and find s(N, W_2)
    # EJR definition: If a group S of voters is l-cohesive (unanimously approve >=l candidates)
    # and |S| > l * n/k, then there must be a voter i in S with |A(i) intersect W| >= l.
    # Here n=10, k=20, so n/k = 0.5.
    
    # Consider group N={1..8}. |N|=8. They are 8-cohesive (approving C_common).
    # Check condition: |N| > 8 * (n/k) => 8 > 8 * 0.5 = 4. This is true.
    # EJR implies that for W_2, there must be at least one voter i in N such that |A(i) intersect W_2| >= 8.
    
    # To minimize s(N, W_2), we again fill the committee with candidates outside N's approval sets.
    # So we select C_9 (4) and C_10 (4).
    # W_2 = C_9 U C_10 U W_2_prime, where |W_2_prime| = 12 and W_2_prime is from C_common U C_unique.
    # The EJR constraint becomes: max_{i in N} |A(i) intersect W_2_prime| >= 8.
    # We want to minimize s(N, W_2) = sum_{i in N} |A(i) intersect W_2_prime|.
    
    # Let x = |W_2_prime intersect C_common| and y = |W_2_prime intersect C_unique|.
    # x + y = 12.
    # s(N, W_2) = sum |A(i) intersect W_2_prime| = 8*x + y = 8*x + (12-x) = 7*x + 12.
    # To minimize this, we need to minimize x.
    
    # The EJR constraint is max |A(i) intersect W_2_prime| >= 8.
    # |A(i) intersect W_2_prime| = |W_2_prime intersect C_common| + |W_2_prime intersect C_i_unique|
    # = x + |W_2_prime intersect C_i_unique|.
    # Since |C_i_unique|=2, the max value of the second term is 2.
    # So we need x + 2 >= 8, which implies x >= 6.
    # The minimum possible value for x is 6.
    
    # With x=6, the minimum satisfaction is s(N, W_2) = 7*6 + 12.
