# Define the variables based on the numbers extracted from the text.
production_year = 1966
act_number = 3
modifier = 2  # From the word "double"

# Calculate the result of the equation.
result = production_year - act_number - modifier

# Print the final equation with all its components, as requested.
print(f"The equation derived from the text is:")
