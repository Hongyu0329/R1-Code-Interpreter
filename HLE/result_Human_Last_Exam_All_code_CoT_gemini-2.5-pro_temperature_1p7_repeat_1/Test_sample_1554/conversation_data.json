    "A code solution is not applicable for this question as it is a request for factual information from the field of philosophy. The question requires identifying a specific philosopher and their concepts, which is a knowledge-retrieval task, not a computational one.\n\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes signs into symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. In his work on the philosophy of language, he made a crucial distinction:\n\n*   **Symptoms (or indications):** These are natural signs that have a causal connection to what they signify. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire.\n*   **Signals:** These are conventional or intentional signs created to communicate or to elicit a specific reaction in a receiver. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop.\n\nThis distinction was central to his analysis of language and meaning.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
