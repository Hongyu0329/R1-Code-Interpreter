# --- Problem Parameters ---
# The problem asks for the number of iterations for the Schwarz method to converge
# for the 1D wave equation up to a time T.
# The key parameters are:
# c: The speed of propagation of the wave.
# M: The size of the overlap between the two subdomains (M = b - a).
# T: The final time of the simulation for which convergence is required.

# We will use some physically plausible example values.
# Let's consider the speed of sound in air.
c = 343.0  # Speed of propagation in m/s
# Let's define a 5-meter overlap region.
M = 5.0    # Overlap size in meters
# Let's say we want to simulate for 0.1 seconds.
T = 0.1    # Final time in seconds

# --- Derivation and Calculation ---
# The convergence of the Optimized Schwarz Method for the wave equation is not
# asymptotic but occurs in a finite number of steps.
# The time it takes for a wave to cross the overlap region is t_overlap = M / c.
# After N iterations, the solution is correct for any time t < N * t_overlap.
# To ensure the solution is correct for the entire interval up to time T, we require:
# N * (M / c) >= T
#
# Solving for N, we get:
# N >= (T * c) / M
#
# Since the number of iterations N must be an integer, we must take the
# smallest integer satisfying this condition, which is the ceiling of the expression.

# Calculate the ratio from the formula
ratio = (T * c) / M

# The number of iterations is the ceiling of this ratio.
num_iterations = math.ceil(ratio)

# --- Output the Result ---
# The final output prints the parameters and shows the step-by-step calculation
# as requested.
