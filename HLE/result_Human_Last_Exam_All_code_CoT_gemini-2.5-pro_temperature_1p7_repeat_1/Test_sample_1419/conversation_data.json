    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, we will use the renormalization group (RG) framework and the epsilon expansion.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Start with the RG beta function for the dimensionless coupling constant `u` in ϕ⁴ theory. This function describes how the coupling's strength changes under a change of energy scale.\n2.  The calculation is performed in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, where `ϵ` is a small parameter. We will use the well-known one-loop beta function for this theory: `β(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²)) u²`.\n3.  A fixed point, `u*`, represents a scale-invariant version of the theory. At a fixed point, the coupling does not change with energy scale, which mathematically means the beta function is zero: `β(u*) = 0`.\n4.  I will solve the equation `-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²)) (u*)² = 0` to find the non-trivial fixed point `u*` (the solution where `u*` is not zero).\n5.  The result will be the leading-order expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`. This is the famous Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n6.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that prints this derived mathematical expression, showing each numerical component as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script derives and prints the expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point\n# in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n\n# The one-loop beta function is of the form:\n# beta(u) = -epsilon * u + B * u^2\n# For phi^4 theory, the coefficient B is 3 / (16 * pi^2).\n\n# A fixed point u* satisfies beta(u*) = 0:\n# -epsilon * u* + B * (u*)^2 = 0\n# For the non-trivial fixed point (u* != 0), we can divide by u*:\n# -epsilon + B * u* = 0\n# This gives u* = epsilon / B\n\n# Substitute the value of B:\n# u* = epsilon / (3 / (16 * pi^2))\n# u* = (16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon\n\n# Define the components of the final expression for printing\ncoupling_symbol = \"u*\"\nepsilon_symbol = \"ε\"\npi_symbol = \"π\"\nnumerator = 16\ndenominator = 3\n\n# Print the final expression step-by-step\nprint(f\"The beta function for the coupling u is: β(u) = -{epsilon_symbol}*u + ({denominator} / ({numerator}*{pi_symbol}²)) * u²\")\nprint(f\"Setting β({coupling_symbol}) = 0 gives the fixed point.\")\nprint(f\"The non-trivial solution is:\")\nprint(f\"{coupling_symbol} = ({numerator} * {pi_symbol}² / {denominator}) * {epsilon_symbol}\")\n```\n<<<u* = (16 * π² / 3) * ε>>>"
