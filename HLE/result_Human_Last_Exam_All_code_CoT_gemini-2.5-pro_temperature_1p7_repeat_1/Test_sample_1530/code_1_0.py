        "2. The Creative Process": "The actions 'knits a veil' and creating a 'feather stitch' are metaphors for the intricate and delicate way ice crystals form.",
        "3. The Description of the Subject": "The key phrase 'She's lace and glass' directly describes frost's appearance: 'lace' for its complex patterns and 'glass' for its crystalline, fragile structure.",
        "4. The Location": "The creation happens on 'starwort, grass and meadowsweet', showing that this phenomenon occurs on plants, just as frost does.",
        "5. The Inevitable End": "The creation 'waits for pelted Autumn... to fray each feather stitch'. This describes how the delicate frost patterns are melted and destroyed by the sun or changing weather characteristic of the autumn season.",
        "6. Conclusion": "Combining these points, the poem is a personification of frost, detailing its beautiful formation on a cold morning and its subsequent disappearance."

    print("B. A floodplain -> This does not fit the 'lace and glass' or 'knits' imagery.")
    print("C. A spider spinning her web -> While a web is lace-like, a spider is not 'cold' or 'glass'. The poem says 'She's lace and glass', personifying the frost itself, which is a better fit.")
    print("D. Autumn as a hunter -> Autumn is described as the destructive force ('he'), not the creator ('she').")
    print("E. A seamstress -> This is the metaphor used to describe the subject, not the literal subject itself.")
