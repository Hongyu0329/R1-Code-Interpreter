        'B': "Incorrect. Chromosomal inversions are sections of a chromosome that have been flipped. Inversions actually suppress recombination in heterozygotes, exacerbating the problem, not compensating for it.",
        'C': "Incorrect. Transposable elements are 'selfish' DNA segments that can move around the genome. Their activity often causes harmful mutations and their accumulation is a hallmark of genomic decay in non-recombining regions.",
        'D': "Correct. Limited recombination allows deleterious mutations to accumulate (Muller's Ratchet). Multigene families (groups of similar genes) provide redundancy, where a functional gene copy can mask a mutated one. They also allow for gene conversion, a process of non-reciprocal recombination that can 'repair' a mutated gene using another copy as a template, thus actively counteracting genetic deterioration.",
        'E': "Incorrect. While polyploidy (whole-genome duplication) does provide redundancy, the formation and maintenance of specific multigene families is a more targeted architectural feature hypothesized to compensate for ongoing decay within specific non-recombining regions (e.g., sex chromosomes)."
