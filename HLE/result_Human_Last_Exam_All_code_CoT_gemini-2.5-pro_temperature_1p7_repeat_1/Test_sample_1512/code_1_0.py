# Plan:
# 1. Define the memory size in decimal digits (D) for integer p.
#    p is a 100-digit number. Using the 1D `char` type, this requires 100 D.
p_memory = 100

# 2. Define the memory size for integer q.
#    q is also a 100-digit number, requiring 100 D.
q_memory = 100

# 3. Define the memory size for the output o = p * q.
#    The product of two 100-digit numbers can have up to 100 + 100 = 200 digits.
o_memory = 200

# 4. Calculate the total minimized memory 'm'.
#    This is the sum of the memory required for p, q, and o.
m = p_memory + q_memory + o_memory

# 5. Print the final equation showing how m is calculated, as requested.
print(f"Minimized total memory use (m) = {p_memory} D (for p) + {q_memory} D (for q) + {o_memory} D (for o) = {m} D")

# Just to be explicit as per the hidden instruction "output each number in the final equation!".
print(f"The equation for the total memory is: {p_memory} + {q_memory} + {o_memory} = {m}")
