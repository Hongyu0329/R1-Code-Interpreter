    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the problem:** The core of the problem is to find the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, for the given autonomous differential equation $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$. After finding $m$, I need to compute the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n2.  **Find Equilibrium Points:**\n    Equilibrium points occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\n    Let's denote the right-hand side as $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\n    We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$:\n    $-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n    Factor out a common term, $-x$:\n    $-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n    Recognize that the term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $(x-1)^2$.\n    So, the equation becomes:\n    $-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n    The roots of this equation are the equilibrium points: $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine Stability of Equilibrium Points:**\n    To determine stability, we can use the first derivative test. We need to find the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at each equilibrium point.\n    $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$.\n\n    *   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$**:\n        Evaluate $f'(0)$:\n        $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n        Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n    *   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$**:\n        Evaluate $f'(1)$:\n        $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n        Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method, like graphical analysis (phase line) or a higher-order derivative test.\n\n    *   **Graphical Analysis for $x = 1$**:\n        Let's examine the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n        - If $x$ is slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), then $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = -(\\text{positive})(\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n        - If $x$ is slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), then $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = -(\\text{positive})(\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n\n        For an equilibrium to be stable, solutions from both sides must converge to it. Since solutions starting just below $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is what's known as a semi-stable equilibrium. In the context of this problem, \"stable\" typically refers to Lyapunov stability, so semi-stable points are not included.\n\n4.  **Count the Number of Stable Points (`m`)**:\n    Based on the analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\n    Therefore, $m = 1$.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    The final task is to calculate $m - 2^{4048}$.\n    Substituting $m=1$, we get:\n    $1 - 2^{4048}$\n    This will be a very large negative number. A Python script is suitable for handling such large integer arithmetic.\n\n6.  **Construct the Python Code**:\n    The code needs to:\n    a.  Set `m = 1`.\n    b.  Calculate the expression `m - 2**4048`.\n    c.  Print the result in a clear format that shows the original numbers in the equation, as requested by the prompt. The format `f\"{m} - 2**4048 = {result}\"` is appropriate.\n\nThis plan covers all the steps, from the mathematical analysis to the final code implementation, ensuring all constraints of the prompt are met.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Find the number of stable equilibrium points, m.\n# The differential equation is x'(t) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x.\n# To find equilibrium points, we set x'(t) = 0:\n# -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n# -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n# -x(x - 1)^2 = 0\n# The equilibrium points are x = 0 and x = 1.\n\n# Step 2: Determine the stability of these points.\n# Let f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x. The stability is determined by the sign of f'(x).\n# f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1.\n# For x = 0: f'(0) = -1 < 0, so x=0 is a stable equilibrium point.\n# For x = 1: f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = 0. The test is inconclusive.\n# We must analyze the sign of f(x) near x=1.\n# f(x) = -x(x-1)^2. For x near 1, x>0 and (x-1)^2 is always non-negative.\n# Thus, f(x) is less than or equal to 0 near x=1.\n# If x > 1, x'(t) < 0, so x(t) moves toward 1.\n# If x < 1, x'(t) < 0, so x(t) moves away from 1.\n# Since trajectories starting on one side of x=1 move away from it, x=1 is not a stable equilibrium point (it is semi-stable).\n# Therefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point.\nm = 1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final expression m - 2^4048.\nbase = 2\nexponent = 4048\n\n# Python's integers have arbitrary precision, so it can handle this large number.\nresult = m - (base**exponent)\n\n# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# So we print the equation with the values substituted.\nprint(f\"{m} - {base}**{exponent} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<1 - 2**4048>>>"
