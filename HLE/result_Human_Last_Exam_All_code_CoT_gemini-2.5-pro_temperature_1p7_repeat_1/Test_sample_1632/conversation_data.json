    "To solve this problem, I will use a computational approach. The number of self-avoiding walks, a(n), does not have a simple known closed-form formula, so we must count the paths algorithmically.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define the Walk:** A walk starts at the origin (0,0) on a 2D grid. It consists of `n` steps, where each step is a move to an adjacent point (up, down, left, or right). The walk is \"self-avoiding,\" meaning it never visits the same point twice.\n2.  **Recursive Counting:** I will implement a recursive function that explores all possible paths. This technique is often called backtracking.\n3.  **State Tracking:** The recursive function, let's call it `count_walks`, will keep track of:\n    *   The current length of the walk.\n    *   The current (x, y) position.\n    *   A set of all points visited so far to prevent cycles.\n4.  **Algorithm Logic:**\n    *   **Base Case:** If the walk's length reaches the target (in this case, 10), it means we have successfully found one complete self-avoiding walk. The function returns 1.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** From the current position, the function will try to move in each of the four valid directions. A move is valid if the destination point has not been visited yet. For each valid move, the function calls itself with an updated state (length increased by 1, new position, and the new point added to the visited set). The results of these recursive calls are summed up to get the total number of walks from the current state.\n5.  **Memoization:** To avoid re-calculating the number of walks for sub-paths that have the same shape but are located at different places on the grid (translation symmetry), I will use memoization. I'll store the results for each unique combination of path length and relative path shape in a cache.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The process starts by calling the `count_walks` function for a walk of length 0 at the origin (0,0). The final return value will be a(10).\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_self_avoiding_walk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    This solution uses a recursive backtracking algorithm with memoization to count the walks efficiently.\n    \"\"\"\n    TARGET_LENGTH = 10\n    memo = {}\n\n    def count_walks(length, pos, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid self-avoiding walks.\n\n        Args:\n            length: The current length of the walk.\n            pos: The current (x, y) coordinates of the head of the walk.\n            visited: A set of (x, y) tuples of all points in the walk.\n\n        Returns:\n            The number of valid self-avoiding walks of TARGET_LENGTH starting from the given state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: if the walk has reached the target length, we've found one valid path.\n        if length == TARGET_LENGTH:\n            return 1\n\n        # To use memoization, we create a canonical key representing the path's shape\n        # relative to its current endpoint. This makes the cache useful for paths that are\n        # translations of each other.\n        px, py = pos\n        relative_visited = frozenset((vx - px, vy - py) for vx, vy in visited)\n        \n        memo_key = (length, relative_visited)\n        if memo_key in memo:\n            return memo[memo_key]\n\n        count = 0\n        x, y = pos\n        \n        # Explore the four possible directions on the Manhattan lattice.\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n            \n            # If the next position has not been visited, continue the walk from there.\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                # Create a new visited set for the recursive call.\n                new_visited = visited | {next_pos}\n                count += count_walks(length + 1, next_pos, new_visited)\n\n        # Store the result in the cache before returning.\n        memo[memo_key] = count\n        return count\n\n    # Start the walk at the origin (0,0). The initial state is a walk of length 0.\n    initial_pos = (0, 0)\n    initial_visited = {initial_pos}\n    result = count_walks(0, initial_pos, initial_visited)\n\n    print(f\"a({TARGET_LENGTH}) = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_self_avoiding_walk()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
