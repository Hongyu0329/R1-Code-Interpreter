# This script calculates the minimum value of q such that Alice's winning
# probability is at least 95%.

# The relationship between Alice's winning probability 'x' and the edge probability 'q' is:
# x = 1 - (1 - q**4 * x**3)**3

# We are given x = 0.95 and need to solve for q.
# Let's rearrange the equation to solve for q:
# 1 - x = (1 - q**4 * x**3)**3
# (1 - x)**(1/3) = 1 - q**4 * x**3
# q**4 * x**3 = 1 - (1 - x)**(1/3)
# q**4 = (1 - (1 - x)**(1/3)) / x**3
# q = ((1 - (1 - x)**(1/3)) / x**3)**(1/4)

x = 0.95
