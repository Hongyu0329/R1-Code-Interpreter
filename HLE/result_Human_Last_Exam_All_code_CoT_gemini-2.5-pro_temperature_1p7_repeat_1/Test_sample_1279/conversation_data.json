    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the task, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** I will first identify the topologically distinct, connected Feynman diagrams for vacuum bubbles at the second-order (proportional to $\\lambda^2$) in $\\phi^4$ theory. A second-order diagram contains two vertices. In $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has four lines. Therefore, we are looking for diagrams with two 4-point vertices and no external lines. There are two such diagrams:\n    *   **Diagram 1 (\"Sunset\"):** The two vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators.\n    *   **Diagram 2 (\"Double-Scoop\"):** Each vertex has one propagator forming a self-loop. The two vertices are then connected to each other by the two remaining propagators.\n2.  **Calculate Individual Symmetry Factors:** For each diagram, I will calculate its symmetry factor, which is the number of ways its internal lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's topology.\n    *   For the \"Sunset\" diagram, the symmetries arise from swapping the two identical vertices and permuting the four identical propagators.\n    *   For the \"Double-Scoop\" diagram, the symmetries arise from swapping the two identical vertices, swapping the two identical propagators connecting them, and swapping the ends of each of the two self-loop propagators.\n3.  **Sum the Factors:** I will add the symmetry factors of the two diagrams to obtain the final total.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically calculates and explains these steps, printing out each number in the equations and the final sum, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Introduction ---\nprint(\"Calculating the symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in φ⁴ theory.\")\nprint(\"There are two topologically distinct connected diagrams at this order.\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Diagram 1: The \"Sunset\" Diagram ---\nprint(\"=\"*40)\nprint(\"Diagram 1: The 'Sunset' Diagram\")\nprint(\"=\"*40)\nprint(\"Description: Two vertices connected to each other by four propagators.\")\nprint(\"\\nSources of symmetry:\")\nprint(\"1.
