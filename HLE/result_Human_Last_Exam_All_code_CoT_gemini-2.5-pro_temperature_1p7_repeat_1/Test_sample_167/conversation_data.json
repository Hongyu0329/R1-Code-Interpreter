    "The problem is to find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Alon-Tarsi Number**: Recall the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)$. It is the smallest integer $k$ for which there's an orientation $D$ of the graph $G$ such that:\n    *   The number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs ($EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$).\n    *   The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$ (i.e., $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$).\n\n2.  **Apply a Key Theorem for Bipartite Graphs**: A crucial theorem by Tarsi states that for any non-empty bipartite graph (like $K_{1000,1000}$) and *any* of its orientations, the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ is always met. This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Problem**: With the first condition always satisfied, the problem reduces to finding the orientation $D$ that minimizes the maximum out-degree of any vertex. Let this minimum possible value of the maximum out-degree be $\\Delta^*(G) = \\min_D \\max_v d_D^+(v)$. The Alon-Tarsi number will then be $AT(G) = \\Delta^*(G) + 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate $\\Delta^*(K_{1000,1000})$**:\n    *   Find a lower bound: For any orientation of a graph, the sum of all out-degrees equals the total number of edges. We can calculate the average out-degree. The maximum out-degree must be at least the average out-degree.\n    *   Find an upper bound: We need to show that an orientation exists which achieves this lower bound. For $d$-regular graphs where $d$ is even (as is the case for $K_{1000,1000}$), an *Eulerian orientation* exists where every vertex has an out-degree of exactly $d/2$. This provides a constructible orientation and an upper bound on $\\Delta^*(G)$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Combine the lower and upper bounds to find the exact value of $\\Delta^*(K_{1000,1000})$ and then add 1 to get the Alon-Tarsi number. The following python script will perform and explain these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_k_mn():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number of K_1000,1000 by following a step-by-step plan.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 1000\n    n = 1000\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for the complete bipartite graph K_1000,1000.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 1: State the simplification for bipartite graphs.\n    print(\"Step 1: Simplify the problem using a known theorem.\")\n    print(f\"For any non-empty bipartite graph G, such as K_{m},{n}, and for any of its orientations D, it is known that the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd ones.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, we only need to find an orientation that minimizes the maximum out-degree of any vertex.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define graph properties.\n    num_vertices = m + n\n    num_edges = m * n\n    # K_m,n is regular if and only if m=n.
