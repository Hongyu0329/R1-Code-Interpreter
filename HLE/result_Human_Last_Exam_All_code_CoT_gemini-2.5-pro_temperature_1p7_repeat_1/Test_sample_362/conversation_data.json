    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction, followed by the Python code to present the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: The reactants are pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n2.  **Analyze Pivalaldehyde**: Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO. This is an aldehyde with a bulky tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl.\n3.  **Analyze the Ylide**: The phosphorus ylide is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. The structure is (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(Ph)₃. This is a non-stabilized ylide.\n4.  **Simulate the Wittig Reaction**: A Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl C=O double bond with the C=C double bond from the ylide.\n    *   The `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part comes from pivalaldehyde.\n    *   The `=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)` part comes from the ylide.\n    *   Connecting these two fragments across the new double bond gives the product: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`.\n5.  **Determine Product Name and Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain.\n    *   Following IUPAC rules, the product is named **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n    *   For stereochemistry, the reaction involves a non-stabilized ylide, which typically favors the Z-isomer. However, the extreme steric bulk of the tert-butyl group on the aldehyde will strongly favor the formation of the more stable **E-isomer (trans)**.\n6.  **Construct the Python Script**: The script will print a detailed explanation of the reaction, the reactants, the products, and the reasoning for the final structure and name. It will explicitly show the final reaction equation and list the numbers from the IUPAC name of the product as requested.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a Wittig reaction and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants\n    aldehyde_name = \"Pivalaldehyde (2,2-dimethylpropanal)\"\n    aldehyde_structure = \"(CH3)3C-CHO\"\n    ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    ylide_structure = \"(2-Cl-C6H4)-CH2-CH=P(Ph)3\"\n\n    # Step 2: Describe the reaction\n    print(\"### Wittig Reaction Analysis ###\\n\")\n    print(\"The Wittig reaction creates an alkene from a carbonyl compound and a phosphorus ylide.\\n\")\n    print(\"Reactants:\")\n    print(f\"1.
