    "An internal adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$ is given by a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, that form a Galois connection. This means that for any $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the equivalence $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ holds.\n\nSuch a pair of maps is uniquely determined by the left adjoint map $f$. For $f$ to be a left adjoint, it must be an order-preserving map that preserves all joins (suprema). In the context of maps between finite total orders, this condition simplifies significantly. Any order-preserving map automatically preserves joins of non-empty subsets. The only additional constraint comes from preserving the join of the empty set, which corresponds to the minimum element. Thus, a map $f$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves the minimum element, meaning $f(0)=0$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $f(0)=0$. For this problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ satisfying:\n$0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nWith the condition $f(0)=0$, we are looking for the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23 (for $f(1)$ through $f(23)$), where each value is taken from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the \"stars and bars\" method. The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n+k}{k}$, where $k$ is the length of the sequence and the values are chosen from $\\{0, \\dots, n\\}$.\nIn our case, the length of the sequence to choose is $k=m=23$, and the values are from $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$, so $n=37$.\n\nThe number of adjunctions is $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Let m and n be the dimensions of the source and target simplexes, respectively.\nm = 23\nn = 37\n\n# The number of internal adjunctions from [m] to [n] in the simplex category\n# is given by the binomial coefficient C(n + m, m).\n# In our case, this is C(37 + 23, 23) = C(60, 23).\ntotal = n + m\nk = m\nresult = math.comb(total, k)\n\n# Print the final equation and its result. The numbers in the final equation\n# are 60 and 23.\nprint(f\"C({total}, {k}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<46556311864836>>>"
