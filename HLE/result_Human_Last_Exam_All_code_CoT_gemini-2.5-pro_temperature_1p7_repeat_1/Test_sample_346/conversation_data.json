    "Of course, I can help with that. This problem involves deciphering a complex expression from SKI combinator calculus, which represents a Church numeral. My plan is to logically break down the expression, identify the known combinators for arithmetic operations, and then calculate the value of the Church numeral `n`. Finally, I will compute `log_2(n)`.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these steps to find the solution. It translates the abstract SKI operations into concrete arithmetic calculations to determine the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for log_2(n) where n is a Church integer represented by a\n    complex SKI combinator expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # === Explanation of the Logic ===\n    #\n    # The SKI expression represents a Church numeral 'n'. Our goal is to find its value.\n    # The core principles we'll use are:\n    # 1.  Structure of the Expression: The top-level expression is S(x)(y)(z).\n    #     This reduces to `x(z)(y(z))`. Given x=I, it becomes `I(z)(y(z))`, which is `z(y(z))`.\n    #     So, the number n is `z` applied to the result of `y` applied to `z`.\n    # 2.  Church Numerals Application: Applying Church numeral 'm' to 'n', written `m(n)`,\n    #     is equivalent to exponentiation: n^m.\n    # 3.  Key Combinators:\n    #     - I: The identity combinator, representing the Church numeral 1.\n    #     - S(I)(I): This combination reduces to the Church numeral 2.\n    #     - S(S(K(S))(K)): This is the successor function, 'SUCC', where SUCC(n) = n + 1.\n\n    # === Step-by-step Calculation ===\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the SKI expression: S(I)(y)(z)\")\n    print(\"This reduces to n = z(y(z))\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the value of z\n    # z = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))\n    # This is SUCC applied to 2.\n    church_1 = 1\n    church_2 = 2\n    z = church_2 + 1\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate z\")\n    print(f\"z = SUCC(2) = 2 + 1 = {z}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the function y(arg)\n    # y = S(I)(S(I)(K(C))) where C = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)\n    # The application y(arg) reduces to arg(arg(C)).\n    # C is SUCC applied to I (Church numeral 1).\n    c = church_1 + 1\n    print(f\"Step 2: Define y(arg)\")\n    print(f\"y(arg) reduces to arg(arg(C))\")\n    print(f\"C = SUCC(1) = 1 + 1 = {c}\")\n    print(f\"So, y(arg) = arg(arg(2))\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate y(z)\n    # We substitute z=3 into y.
