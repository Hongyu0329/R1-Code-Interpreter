    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to identify the geometric shape of the \"outer-hull of the great icosahedron\". The great icosahedron is a complex, non-convex polyhedron. Its outer-hull, or convex hull, is the smallest convex shape that contains it. For the great icosahedron, this outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  Next, I need to understand what \"triangulating\" this shape means. Triangulation is the process of dividing a surface into a set of triangles. The question asks for the *minimal* number of triangles.\n3.  A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid that is, by definition, composed of 20 triangular faces.\n4.  Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already made up entirely of triangles, this is the most efficient and minimal triangulation possible. Any further subdivision of these faces would result in a higher number of triangles.\n5.  Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull (the regular icosahedron) is simply the number of faces it has.\n6.  The code will state these facts and print the final number, which is 20.\n\n```python\ndef solve_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the\n    outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The outer-hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    # A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.\n    # All of its faces are equilateral triangles.\n    num_faces_regular_icosahedron = 20\n\n    # Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already composed of triangles,\n    # the minimal number of triangles for its triangulation is simply its number of faces.\n    print(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"A regular icosahedron is already composed of triangular faces.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed is equal to its number of faces.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    # The prompt requires printing the numbers in the final equation.\n    # We will format the output to look like a statement or equation.\n    equation_part_1 = \"Minimal number of triangles\"\n    equation_part_2 = str(num_faces_regular_icosahedron)\n    print(f\"{equation_part_1} = {equation_part_2}\")\n\nsolve_triangulation()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
