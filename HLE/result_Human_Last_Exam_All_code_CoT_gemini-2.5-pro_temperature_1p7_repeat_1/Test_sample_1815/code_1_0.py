# This Python code will print the result of the reasoning explained above.
# The reasoning demonstrates that no group topology on the integers can satisfy both
# the "totally bounded" and "no nontrivial convergent sequences" properties,
# under the plausible assumption that such a topology must be a subgroup topology.

# Let's denote the number of such topologies by N.
# My step-by-step analysis leads to the conclusion that N=0.
# The following code prints this result.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted in the
# simplest way, by setting up an equation for the result 0.

number_of_topologies_in_hausdorff_case = 0
number_of_topologies_in_non_hausdorff_case = 0

total_number = number_of_topologies_in_hausdorff_case + number_of_topologies_in_non_hausdorff_case

# Printing the numbers that form the final calculation
print(number_of_topologies_in_hausdorff_case)
print(number_of_topologies_in_non_hausdorff_case)
print(total_number)
