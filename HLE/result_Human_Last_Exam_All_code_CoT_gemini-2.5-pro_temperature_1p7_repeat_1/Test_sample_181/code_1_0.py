    Solves the problem by identifying the mathematical nature of the foo(n) function.

    The foo(n) function counts the number of binary operations on a set {1, ..., n}
    that satisfy the group axioms. Direct computation for n=7 is infeasible due to
    the massive search space (7^49 possibilities).

    The problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct group structures (Cayley tables)
    on a labeled set of n elements. The formula for this is:
    Sum_{G} (n! / |Aut(G)|)
    where the sum is over all non-isomorphic groups G of order n.

    For n=7 (a prime number), there is only one group up to isomorphism:
    the cyclic group C_7.

    The order of the automorphism group of C_n is given by Euler's totient function, phi(n).
    For a prime p, phi(p) = p - 1.

    So, for n=7, the number of group structures is 7! / phi(7).
