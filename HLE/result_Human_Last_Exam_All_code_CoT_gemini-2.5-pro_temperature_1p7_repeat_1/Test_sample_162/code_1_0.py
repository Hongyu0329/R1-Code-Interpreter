# --- Logical Analysis of Biological Evidence ---

# Step 1: Define the core question.
question = "What is the source of Dilp2 that drives neural stem cell reactivation?"

# Step 2: Evaluate the evidence for the hemolymph pathway (Option B).
# Evidence 1: "When overexpressing a Dilp2 binding protein, Imp-L2 in the fat body, Imp-L2 'soaks up' Dilp2 in the hemolymph..."
# Result 1: "...neural stem cells stay in quiescence and fail to reactivate."
print("Analysis of Hemolymph Pathway (Option B):")
print("  - An experiment specifically removes Dilp2 from the hemolymph.")
print("  - The result is a complete FAILURE of neural stem cell reactivation.")
print("  - This indicates that Dilp2 in the hemolymph is NECESSARY for reactivation.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Evaluate the evidence for the DRN transport pathway (Option A).
# Evidence 2: "Inhibiting DRN activity by over expressing a potassium channel also causes neural stem cells' delay in reactivation."
# Caveat: "DRNs may have function independent of Dilp2 absorption."
print("Analysis of DRN Pathway (Option A):")
print("  - An experiment inhibits the activity of the DRNs.")
print("  - The result is a DELAY, not a failure, of reactivation.")
print("  - This suggests DRNs play a role, but it may not be the primary trigger or dependent on receiving Dilp2.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Evaluate supporting evidence.
# Evidence 3: "Incubating a brain from an animal that has never been fed food in bovine insulin...drives neural stem cell reactivation."
print("Analysis of Supporting Evidence:")
print("  - Adding a Dilp2-like signal (insulin) externally to an isolated brain is SUFFICIENT to cause reactivation.")
print("  - This supports the idea that the signal comes from outside the brain, like the hemolymph.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 5: Synthesize and conclude.
# The evidence for the hemolymph pathway is direct and the outcome is definitive (failure to reactivate).
# The evidence for the DRN pathway is less direct and the outcome is less severe (delay).
# Therefore, the hemolymph is the critical source.
conclusion = "B. Dilp2 secreted to the hemolymph"

print("Conclusion:")
print("The most conclusive experiment is blocking Dilp2 in the hemolymph, which completely prevents reactivation.")
print(f"Therefore, the primary source of Dilp2 that drives neural stem cell reactivation is the one secreted to the hemolymph.")
