    """
    This script calculates the number of codimension 2 boundary strata of the
    moduli space M_bar_{3,1}. This is equivalent to counting the number of
    topological types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 3 with 1 marked point
    and 2 nodes.

    The method is a systematic enumeration of all possibilities based on the
    dual graph of the stable curves.

    Nomenclature:
    - v: number of irreducible components of the curve.
    - k: number of nodes (k=2 for codimension 2).
    - g_i: geometric genus of component i.
    - d_i: number of nodes on component i (degree in the dual graph).
    - n_i: number of marked points on component i.
