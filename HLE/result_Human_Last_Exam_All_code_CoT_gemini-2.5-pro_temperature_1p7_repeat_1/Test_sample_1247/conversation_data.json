    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n=333 with exactly k=3 inversions. A permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n\nFor a permutation to have a very small number of inversions compared to its length, it must be \"close\" to the identity permutation \\((1, 2, ..., n)\\). The structure of such permutations is quite restricted. We can classify the permutations with 3 inversions by analyzing how the inversions are formed. An inversion is a pair of elements in the permutation that are out of their natural order.\n\nLet's analyze the permutations based on the structure of their inversions. A key insight for pattern avoidance is that for a permutation \\(\\pi\\) to avoid 1324, for any inversion (\\(\\pi_j > \\pi_k\\) with \\(j<k\\)), there cannot exist an element \\(\\pi_i\\) with \\(i<j\\) and \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k\\) and an element \\(\\pi_l\\) with \\(l>k\\) and \\(\\pi_l > \\pi_j\\). Essentially, the inversion cannot be \"framed\" by smaller and larger values.\n\nFor a permutation with only 3 inversions, the inverted elements must either be at the very beginning of the permutation or at the very end to avoid forming a 1324 pattern with the sorted bulk of the permutation.\n\nWe identify three main structural types of permutations of length \\(n\\) with 3 inversions that can avoid the 1324 pattern:\n\n**Type 1: One element is moved left over three smaller elements.**\nThis creates a block of four elements like `(4, 1, 2, 3)`. For the permutation to be 1324-avoiding, this block must be at one of the ends.\n*   At the beginning: \\(\\pi = (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, ..., n)\\).\n*   At the end: \\(\\pi = (1, 2, ..., n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1)\\).\nThis gives us 2 such permutations.\n\n**Type 2: The inversions are formed by a block of three elements arranged in reverse order, like `(3, 2, 1)`.**\nThis block creates 3 inversions: (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). Again, to avoid the 1324 pattern, this block must be at one of the ends.\n*   At the beginning: \\(\\pi = (3, 2, 1, 4, 5, ..., n)\\).\n*   At the end: \\(\\pi = (1, 2, ..., n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\).\nThis gives us another 2 permutations.\n\n**Type 3: The 3 inversions are formed by two separate, non-overlapping blocks of inverted elements.**\nThe only combination with 3 inversions is one block with 2 inversions (like `(3, 1, 2)`) and one block with 1 inversion (like `(2, 1)`). To avoid forming a 1324 pattern, one block must be at the start and the other at the end.\n*   The `(3,1,2)` block at the start and the `(2,1)` block at the end:\n    \\(\\pi = (3, 1, 2, 4, ..., n-2, n, n-1)\\).\n*   The `(2,1)` block at the start and the `(3,1,2)`-type block at the end (values `n-2, n-1, n` permuted as `n, n-2, n-1`):\n    \\(\\pi = (2, 1, 3, ..., n-3, n, n-2, n-1)\\).\nThis gives us 2 more permutations.\n\nOther possible structures for 3 inversions, such as three separate single inversions `(2,1, 4,3, 6,5, ...)` or more complex intertwined inversions like `(2,4,1,3, ...)` can be shown to contain a 1324 pattern for a large \\(n\\) like 333.\n\nSo, the total count is the sum of the counts from these three types. The length \\(n=333\\) is large enough for these boundary cases to be distinct.\n\nThe final code will sum up the counts for each type.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n=333 with k=3 inversions\n# is denoted by av_{333}^3(1324).\n# Based on the analysis, such permutations are rare and have very specific\n# structures, essentially having their inversions \"at the ends\" of the\n# permutation to avoid forming a 1324 pattern.\n\n# Case 1: Permutations with a (4,1,2,3)-like block of values.\n# The inversions are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). This block must be at the beginning or end.\n# e.g., (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., n) or (1, ..., n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1).\ncount_type1 = 2\nprint(f\"Number of permutations from Type 1 (e.g., (4,1,2,3,...)): {count_type1}\")\n\n# Case 2: Permutations with a (3,2,1)-like block of values.\n# The inversions are (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). This block must be at the beginning or end.\n# e.g., (3, 2, 1, 4, ..., n) or (1, ..., n-3, n, n-1, n-2).\ncount_type2 = 2\nprint(f\"Number of permutations from Type 2 (e.g., (3,2,1,...)): {count_type2}\")\n\n# Case 3: Permutations formed by two disjoint blocks of inversions,\n# one with 2 inversions and one with 1 inversion.\n# For example, a (3,1,2) block and a (2,1) block. One must be at the\n# beginning and the other at the end.\n# e.g., (3,1,2, 4,..., n-2, n, n-1) or (2,1, 3,..., n-3, n,n-2,n-1).\ncount_type3 = 2\nprint(f\"Number of permutations from Type 3 (two disjoint blocks): {count_type3}\")\n\n# The total number is the sum of these counts.\ntotal_count = count_type1 + count_type2 + count_type3\nprint(f\"\\nThe final equation is: {count_type1} + {count_type2} + {count_type3} = {total_count}\")\n\nprint(f\"The value of av_{333}^3(1324) is: {total_count}\")\n```\n<<<6>>>"
