# Plan:
# The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n=333 with k=3 inversions
# is denoted by av_{333}^3(1324).
# Based on the analysis, such permutations are rare and have very specific
# structures, essentially having their inversions "at the ends" of the
# permutation to avoid forming a 1324 pattern.

# Case 1: Permutations with a (4,1,2,3)-like block of values.
# The inversions are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). This block must be at the beginning or end.
# e.g., (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., n) or (1, ..., n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1).
count_type1 = 2
print(f"Number of permutations from Type 1 (e.g., (4,1,2,3,...)): {count_type1}")

# Case 2: Permutations with a (3,2,1)-like block of values.
# The inversions are (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). This block must be at the beginning or end.
# e.g., (3, 2, 1, 4, ..., n) or (1, ..., n-3, n, n-1, n-2).
count_type2 = 2
print(f"Number of permutations from Type 2 (e.g., (3,2,1,...)): {count_type2}")

# Case 3: Permutations formed by two disjoint blocks of inversions,
# one with 2 inversions and one with 1 inversion.
# For example, a (3,1,2) block and a (2,1) block. One must be at the
# beginning and the other at the end.
# e.g., (3,1,2, 4,..., n-2, n, n-1) or (2,1, 3,..., n-3, n,n-2,n-1).
count_type3 = 2
print(f"Number of permutations from Type 3 (two disjoint blocks): {count_type3}")

# The total number is the sum of these counts.
total_count = count_type1 + count_type2 + count_type3
print(f"\nThe final equation is: {count_type1} + {count_type2} + {count_type3} = {total_count}")

print(f"The value of av_{333}^3(1324) is: {total_count}")
