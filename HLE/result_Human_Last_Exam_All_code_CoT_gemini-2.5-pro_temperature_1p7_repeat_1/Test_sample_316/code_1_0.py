# The problem asks for a critical exponent for a reverse square function estimate for the cone in R^3.
# This is a known problem in harmonic analysis.
# The dependence of the optimal exponent alpha on p is determined by the geometry of wave packet interactions.
# The critical exponents p are the points where the nature of the "worst-case" geometric configuration changes.

# For the cone in R^3, there are two main phenomena governing the estimate:
# 1. Bilinear interactions, which are known to be critical at p = 3.
# 2. Multilinear or Kakeya-type interactions, related to the Tomas-Stein restriction exponent, which is p = 4 for the cone.

# The problem states that there are two critical exponents and one of them is 4.
# Based on the theory, the other critical exponent must be 3.

known_critical_exponent = 4
# The other critical exponent from harmonic analysis theory is 3.
other_critical_exponent = 3
