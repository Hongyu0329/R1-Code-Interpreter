    "Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The \"semidihedral group of size 512\" refers to the group $SD_{512}$. This is a member of the family of semidihedral groups $SD_{2^n}$. Since the order is $512 = 2^9$, we have $n=9$.\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is any subgroup $H$ that can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of *distinct* subgroups that can be formed this way.\n3.  **Use Group Theory Properties:** A key theorem in group theory states that for any finite group $G$, the set of all distinct power subgroups is given by $\\{G^d\\}$, where $d$ ranges over all positive divisors of the exponent of $G$. The exponent of a group is the least common multiple of the orders of all its elements.\n4.  **Determine the Exponent:** For the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ (where $n \\ge 3$), the exponent is known to be $2^{n-1}$. For our group $SD_{512}$, with $n=9$, the exponent is $2^{9-1} = 2^8 = 256$.\n5.  **Find the Divisors:** The divisors of the exponent, 256, are all the powers of 2 from $2^0$ to $2^8$. These are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n6.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups:** Each of these divisors gives rise to a power subgroup: $G^1, G^2, G^4, \\dots, G^{256}$. It can be shown that for the semidihedral group, all of these subgroups are distinct because they have different orders. Therefore, the number of distinct power subgroups is simply the number of divisors of the exponent.\n7.  **Calculate the Final Number:** The number of divisors of $256 = 2^8$ is $8+1 = 9$. So there are 9 distinct power subgroups.\n8.  **Construct the Code:** The Python code will formalize this calculation. It will determine $n$ from the group size, calculate the exponent, find the number of its divisors, and print the result along with the explanation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group SD_{2^n} has order 2^n.\n    # We find n for the given group size.\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    if n < 3:\n        print(f\"Error: The semidihedral group SD_{group_size} is not defined for n < 3.\")\n        return\n\n    # The exponent of the semidihedral group SD_{2^n} is 2^(n-1).\n    exponent_power = n - 1\n    exponent = 2**exponent_power\n\n    # The distinct power subgroups are G^d, where d is a divisor of the exponent.\n    # The divisors of the exponent 2^(n-1) are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^(n-1).\n    # The number of these divisors is (n-1) - 0 + 1 = n.\n    num_power_subgroups = n\n\n    print(f\"For the semidihedral group of size {group_size}, we have n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The exponent of this group is 2^({n} - 1) = {exponent}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups is the number of divisors of the exponent {exponent}.\")\n    \n    divisors_powers = list(range(n))\n    divisors = [2**i for i in divisors_powers]\n    \n    # We are asked to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The number of divisors of 2^(n-1) is (n-1) + 1 = n.\n    print(f\"Number of divisors = ({n} - 1) + 1 = {n}\")\n    print(f\"The divisors are: {', '.join(map(str, divisors))}.\")\n    print(f\"This leads to {len(divisors)} distinct power subgroups.\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the number of power subgroups is {num_power_subgroups}.\")\n\nsolve_power_subgroups()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
