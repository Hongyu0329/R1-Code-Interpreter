    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the answer:\n1.  First, I will identify the key figures and the subject of the question: the evaluator is Liu Ban (刘攽), the subject is Zhang Ji's (张籍) seven-character poems (七言诗).\n2.  I will search through my database of classical Chinese literary criticism to find where Liu Ban discusses Zhang Ji. The most likely source for such a concise evaluation is a \"Poetry Talk\" (诗话) text. Liu Ban is the author of the famous *Zhongshan Shihua* (《中山诗话》).\n3.  I will locate the specific quote within that text that contains the evaluation.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to store this quote and print it as the answer in Chinese, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_evaluation():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function retrieves and prints Liu Ban's evaluation of Zhang Ji's poetry.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The evaluator, from the Northern Song Dynasty.\n  evaluator = \"刘攽\"\n\n  # The poet being evaluated, from the Tang Dynasty.\n  poet = \"张籍\"\n  \n  # The subject of the evaluation.\n  subject = \"七言诗\"\n\n  # Liu Ban's evaluation is found in his work \"Zhongshan Shihua\" (《中山诗话》).\n  # The quote is \"张籍七言诗，拙多于巧。\"\n  # This means Zhang Ji's seven-character poems possess more artlessness/sincerity (拙) than cleverness/artifice (巧).\n  evaluation_text = \"张籍七言诗，拙多于巧。\"\n\n  source = \"《中山诗话》\"\n\n  print(f\"根据{evaluator}在其著作{source}中的记载，他对{poet}{subject}的精准评价是：\")\n  print(f\"“{evaluation_text}”\")\n\nfind_evaluation()\n```\n<<<刘攽在《中山诗话》中对张籍的七言诗评价为：“张籍七言诗，拙多于巧。”>>>"
