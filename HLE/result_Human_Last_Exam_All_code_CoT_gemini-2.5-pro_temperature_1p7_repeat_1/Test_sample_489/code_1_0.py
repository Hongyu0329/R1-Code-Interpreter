    # Statement a) The quotient topology on Omega_g^rt / GL_g(Z) is Hausdorff.
    # Reasoning: The quotient space X/G is Hausdorff if and only if the orbits are closed.
    # The action of GL_g(Z) on the boundary of the rational closure Omega_g^rt has non-closed orbits.
    # Distinct boundary points can be in the closure of each other's orbits without being in the same orbit.
    # This is a standard fact in the theory of Satake compactifications.
    # Therefore, the quotient is not Hausdorff.
    results.append('N')

    # Statement b) The barycentric subdivision of the perfect cone decomposition of Omega_4^rt consists only of simplicial cones.
    # Reasoning: The barycentric subdivision is a general geometric procedure that refines any polyhedral complex
    # into a simplicial complex. This holds true for any such decomposition, regardless of the dimension g=4 or the
    # specific nature of the perfect cone decomposition.
    results.append('Y')

    # Statement c) For any compact set K in Omega_g^rt there exists a set of finitely many cones in the
    # second Voronoi compactification such that their union contains K.
    # Reasoning: The perfect cone (or second Voronoi) decomposition forms a fan that is locally finite.
    # Local finiteness means that any compact set K intersects only a finite number of cones in the fan.
    # The union of this finite set of cones will therefore contain K.
    results.append('Y')

    # Statement d) The number of orbits of maximal cones in the perfect cone decomposition of Omega_7^rt is 33.
    # Reasoning: The GL_g(Z)-orbits of maximal cones are in one-to-one correspondence with the equivalence
    # classes of g-ary perfect quadratic forms. The classification of these forms is a classic problem in number theory.
    # For g=7, the number of such classes was determined to be 33 by researchers like Jacques Martinet.
    # This number, 33, is a celebrated result.
    results.append('Y')

    # Statement e) The GL_g(Z)-stabilizer of a cone sigma in the central cone decomposition is finite if sigma intersects Omega_g.
    # Reasoning: The 'central cone decomposition' is another name for the perfect cone decomposition. If a cone sigma
    # intersects the open set Omega_g (positive definite matrices), it has full dimension. Such a cone corresponds
    # to a class of perfect positive definite quadratic forms, which in turn defines a lattice.
    # The stabilizer of the cone is the automorphism group of this lattice, which is known to be a finite group
    # by a classical theorem of Jordan and Minkowski.
    results.append('Y')

    # Statement f) The number of orbits of cones in the Second Voronoi decomposition of Omega_5^rt is 222.
    # Reasoning: This asks for the total number of orbits of cones of all dimensions for g=5. This includes faces of the maximal cones.
    # Based on the known classification of perfect forms for g=5 and their facial structures (by Barnes and others),
    # the total number of orbits of cones of all dimensions from 0 to 15 (which is g*(g+1)/2) can be summed up.
    # The counts are: 3 (dim 15) + 12 + 25 + 35 + 34 + 34 + 25 + 19 + 15 + 10 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 (dims 14 down to 1) + 1 (dim 0) = 229.
    # The number 222 is incorrect.
    results.append('N')

    # Statement g) Given cones tau, sigma in the perfect cone decomposition with tau a face of sigma, one has
    # that their corresponding groups of GL_g(Z)-stabilizers satisfy Stab(tau) subset of Stab(sigma).
    # Reasoning: This statement claims that any symmetry of a face must also be a symmetry of the larger cone.
    # This is generally false. Consider a cone sigma that has another cone sigma' adjacent to it along the face tau.
    # An element of GL_g(Z) could stabilize the face tau (e.g., act as a reflection across the hyperplane containing tau)
    # while swapping sigma and sigma'. Such an element is in Stab(tau) but not in Stab(sigma).
    # Therefore, Stab(tau) is not a subset of Stab(sigma).
