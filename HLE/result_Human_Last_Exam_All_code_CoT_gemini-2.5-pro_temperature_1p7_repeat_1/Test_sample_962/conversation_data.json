    "Of course. I can provide a Python implementation for a 2-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\n\n### Plan\n\nHere is my plan to generate the Python code for you.\n\n1.  **Choose the Right Scheme**: I will implement the **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)** scheme. FROST is an excellent choice because it is specifically designed to be a secure and efficient 2-round protocol, fitting your requirements perfectly. It's a state-of-the-art scheme based on the well-understood Schnorr signature algorithm. While the formal term \"tightly secure\" refers to specific properties of the security proof, FROST is considered highly secure and robust by the cryptographic community.\n\n2.  **Code Structure**: The implementation will be self-contained in a single Python script with no external libraries needed besides the standard `hashlib` and `secrets`.\n    *   **Cryptographic Primitives**: First, I will define the parameters for the `secp256k1` elliptic curve and implement the necessary mathematical functions: modular inverse, point addition, and scalar multiplication.\n    *   **Trusted Dealer**: For simplicity, instead of a complex Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol, I will use a \"trusted dealer\" to generate and distribute secret shares to all participants. The dealer will create a secret polynomial of degree `t-1`, where the main secret is the polynomial's constant term. Each participant `i` gets `f(i)` as their secret share.\n    *   **Participant Class**: Each participant will be represented by a class. This class will hold their secret share and handle their part in the signing protocol.\n    *   **Signing Protocol (2 Rounds)**:\n        1.  **Round 1 (Commitment)**: A chosen group of `t` signers will each generate a pair of secret nonces and compute the corresponding public commitments. They will then \"broadcast\" these commitments.\n        2.  **Round 2 (Partial Signature Generation)**: After receiving commitments from all other signers, each participant will calculate a binding value, use it to determine the group nonce `R` and the challenge `c`, and then compute their partial signature `z_i`.\n    *   **Aggregation and Verification**: An aggregator will collect the partial signatures (`z_i`) and sum them to create the final signature value `s`. The complete signature is `(R, s)`. Finally, the code will perform the verification step `s*G == R + c*PK` and print out each component of this equation to demonstrate its correctness, as you requested.\n\nThis structured approach will clearly demonstrate the key generation, the two-round signing process, and the final verification of a `t-out-of-n` threshold signature.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport secrets\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set\n\n# This implementation is for educational purposes to demonstrate the FROST protocol.\n# It is not recommended for production use without a full security audit and\n# uses a simplified trusted dealer for key generation.\n\n# --- 1.
