# The user wants to understand the reasoning behind the choice of treatment.
# The patient shows clear signs of septic shock originating from necrotic tissue.
# The cornerstones of septic shock management are:
# 1. Resuscitation (e.g., IV fluids).
# 2. Source Control (e.g., surgical debridement).
# 3. Antibiotics (e.g., IV medication).

# Let's map the choices to these principles:
A = "Intravenous fluid"  # Principle 1: Resuscitation
B = "Intravenous medication" # Principle 3: Antibiotics
C = "Surgical debridement of necrotic sites" # Principle 2: Source Control
D = "Chemical debridement of necrotic sites" # Inadequate source control
E = "High-flow O2" # Not indicated by SpO2 of 98%

# The ideal treatment plan involves A + B + C. Since this is not an option, we must evaluate the given combinations.
F = "A & B"  # Resuscitation + Antibiotics. Fails to address Source Control.
G = "B & C"  # Antibiotics + Source Control. This is the definitive treatment plan. Resuscitation (A) is an implicit and immediate supportive measure but B & C treat the cause.
H = "C & E"  # Source Control + O2. Fails to include mandatory antibiotics (B) and uses a non-essential treatment (E).

# Comparing F and G:
# Omitting Source Control (C) is a critical error in managing sepsis with a clear source. The patient will not improve without it.
# Therefore, G is the best choice as it combines the two most critical therapeutic interventions: definitive source control and systemic antibiotics.
