    print("The laboratory's mistake was trusting evidence from a faulty Quality Control test. They observed 'no growth' on their Batch 3 control plate and assumed it meant the antibiotic was working. However, the true reason for 'no growth' was that their test organism was dead. This flawed test failed to reveal the critical fact that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed during preparation.")

print("\n<<<The laboratory's mistake was in trusting the result of a flawed Quality Control (QC) test. Their QC organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable and failed to grow. They misinterpreted this lack of growth on Batch 3 as evidence that the antibiotic was working, when in reality, the antibiotic had been destroyed by autoclaving and the test organism was simply unable to grow on anything.>>>")
