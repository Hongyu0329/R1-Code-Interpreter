    This function analyzes the properties of a topological space X and determines

    # The problem can be solved by deduction based on theorems from point-set topology.

    # Let's outline the reasoning:
    # 1. We are given a continuous bijection f: R -> X.
    # 2. The domain R is a sigma-compact, locally compact Hausdorff (LCH) space.
    # 3. The codomain X is a locally compact metric space, hence it is also LCH.
    # 4. A standard theorem states that a continuous bijection from a sigma-compact LCH
    #    space to an LCH space is a homeomorphism.
    # 5. Therefore, X must be homeomorphic to R. This means there is at most one
    #    possible homeomorphism class.
    # 6. We must verify that this class is not empty. We do this by checking if R
    #    itself satisfies all the given properties, which it does.
    #    - R is a locally compact metric space.
    #    - The identity map R->R is a continuous bijection.
    #    - For any x != y in R, a closed interval K = [a, b] can be found
    #      (e.g., K = [x-1, (x+y)/2] for x < y) such that x is in the
    #      interior of K and y is not in K.
    # 7. From points 5 and 6, we conclude there is exactly one such homeomorphism class.

    number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1

    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
    # The final equation is: "Number of homeomorphism classes = 1".
    equation_lhs = "Number of homeomorphism classes"
    equation_op = "="
    equation_rhs = number_of_homeomorphism_classes
