# Based on the logical deduction outlined, the problem simplifies significantly.
# We assume a symmetric matrix M_n satisfying the given conditions.
# For example, a symmetric tridiagonal matrix with eigenvalues in [0, 0.25].
# Let M_n0 be such a matrix for the (uncalculated) optimal n_n0.

# 1. Cofactor Matrix Property
# If a matrix M is symmetric, its cofactor matrix A is also symmetric.
# A_symmetric = True

# 2. Antisymmetric Part Calculation
# The antisymmetric part K' of a symmetric matrix A is K' = 0.5 * (A - A^T).
# Since A is symmetric, A = A^T, so K' = 0.
Antisymmetric_part_is_zero = True

# 3. Tridiagonalization
# The tridiagonal form of a zero matrix is the zero matrix.
# We can represent the zero matrix T symbolically.
# Let's consider its size. For n=1, the size is (2^(1+1)-1) = 3.
# We'll use a 3x3 zero matrix for demonstration, but the logic holds for any size.
T = np.zeros((3, 3))

# 4. Squaring the Tridiagonal Matrix
# The square of the zero matrix is the zero matrix.
T_squared = T @ T

# 5. Ky Fan Norm
# The Ky Fan k-norm is the sum of the k largest singular values.
# For the zero matrix, all singular values are 0.
# Therefore, any and all Ky Fan norms are 0. The largest one is also 0.
singular_values = np.linalg.svd(T_squared, compute_uv=False)
largest_ky_fan_norm = np.sum(singular_values) # This is the nuclear norm, which is the largest possible Ky Fan norm.
