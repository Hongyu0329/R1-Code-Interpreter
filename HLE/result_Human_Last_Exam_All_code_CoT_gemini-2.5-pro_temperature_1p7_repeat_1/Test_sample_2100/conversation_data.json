    "This is a historical trivia question. I will identify the key figures and events mentioned in the prompt to find the answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Analyze the quote: \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This points to a historical explorer whose burial site was lost.\n2.  Identify the author: Andrei Voznesensky was a famous Russian poet. This suggests the subject is a figure from Russian history.\n3.  Use the final clue: The mystery of the grave was solved in the \"late 1980s\".\n4.  Combine the clues: I am looking for a famous Russian explorer, memorialized in a poem by Voznesensky, whose lost grave was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n5.  Voznesensky's most famous work involving an explorer is the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which is about the life and death of Nikolai Rezanov. Rezanov was a Russian nobleman and explorer who died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His grave was destroyed during the Soviet era, and a memorial was re-established on the supposed site in the late 20th century.\n6.  The man's last name is Rezanov. I will write a Python script to present this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_the_sailor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the historical figure based on the provided clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n    mystery = \"A lost grave\"\n    discovery_period = \"late 1980s\"\n\n    # The clues point to a specific figure in Russian history immortalized\n    # by Voznesensky's poem, which later became the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n    # This historical figure was an explorer whose grave was lost and then rediscovered.\n    \n    first_name = \"Nikolai\"\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\n    print(f\"The poet {poet} described a man as '{description}'.\")\n    print(f\"The man was a Russian explorer, and the mystery of his lost grave was resolved in the {discovery_period}.\")\n    print(f\"This figure is {first_name} {last_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the man's last name is:\")\n    print(last_name)\n\nfind_the_sailor()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
