# Based on the mathematical derivation, the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# simplifies significantly.
#
# We found that ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).
# Substituting this into the expression gives:
# (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
#
# This simplifies to:
# 1 * (pi^2/6 - 1) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
#
# After cancellation, we get:
# 1 + 10^15

# The numbers in the final simplified equation are 1 and 10^15.
num1 = 1
num2 = 10**15

# Perform the final calculation
result = num1 + num2
