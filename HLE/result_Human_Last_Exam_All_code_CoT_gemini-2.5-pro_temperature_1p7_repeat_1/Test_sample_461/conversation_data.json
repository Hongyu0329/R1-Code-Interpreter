    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to identify the polycyclic hydrocarbon based on the user's description. The clue \"creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years\" strongly suggests a dinosaur.\n2.  I will search for a polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a dinosaur. This leads to a biomarker sterane known by the trivial name \"Dinosaurane.\"\n3.  I will then create a Python script that prints the answer in a clear sentence, incorporating the number 65 from your prompt as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_hydrocarbon_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature extinct for a specified number of years.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of years mentioned in the problem.\n    years_extinct = 65\n\n    # The common name of the polycyclic hydrocarbon.\n    # This molecule is a sterane biomarker found in petroleum source rocks.\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"Dinosaurane\"\n\n    # Print the final answer in a descriptive sentence.\n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted\n    # here by ensuring the number from the prompt is present in the output.\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over {years_extinct} million years is: {hydrocarbon_name}\")\n\nfind_hydrocarbon_name()\n```\n<<<Dinosaurane>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
