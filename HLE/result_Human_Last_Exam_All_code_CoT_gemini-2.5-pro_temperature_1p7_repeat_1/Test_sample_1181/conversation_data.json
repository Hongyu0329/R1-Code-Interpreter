    "My plan is to answer the user's question about the movie *Solaris*.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The request asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*.\n2.  **Find the Answer:** The character who is deeply nostalgic for Earth and its sounds, like rustling leaves, is the protagonist, psychologist Kris Kelvin. His longing for Earth is a central element of his character arc. This corresponds to option 'A'.\n3.  **Incorporate Coding Requirement:** The prompt requires a Python script. I will write a script that programmatically states the answer.\n4.  **Satisfy the \"Equation\" Constraint:** The prompt includes a specific, unusual instruction: \"output each number in the final equation!\". Since this isn't a mathematical problem, I will use a relevant number from the movie's context—its release year, 1972—to create a simple symbolic equation. The equation `1972 / 1972 = 1` will resolve to `1`, corresponding to the first answer choice, 'A'.\n5.  **Construct the Final Script:** The script will first identify the correct character, then print the step-by-step \"equation\" that leads to the answer choice number, and finally output the answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The question identifies a character from the 1972 film \"Solaris\".\n# The protagonist, Kris Kelvin, is defined by his profound homesickness and\n# nostalgia for the natural world of Earth, which includes the sound of leaves.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Kris\"\nmovie_year = 1972\n\n# The correct answer is 'A', which is the first option.\n# To satisfy the prompt's requirement for a numbered equation, we will create\n# one that resolves to the number 1, representing the first choice.\n# We will use the movie's release year.\n\nprint(f\"The character who misses the sound of rustling leaves on Earth is {character_name}.\")\nprint(\"To find the corresponding answer choice, we will solve the following equation using the movie's release year:\")\n\nnumerator = movie_year\ndenominator = movie_year\nresult = math.floor(numerator / denominator)\n\nprint(f\"Equation: {numerator} / {denominator} = {result}\")\nprint(f\"The result is {result}, which corresponds to the first answer choice (A).\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
