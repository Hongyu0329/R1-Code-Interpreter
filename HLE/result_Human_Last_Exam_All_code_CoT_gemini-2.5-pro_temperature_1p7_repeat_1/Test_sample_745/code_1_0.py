    This function solves the topological problem about the number of components.
    
    The problem asks for the largest number of components X \ C can have, where:
    - X is a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c.
    - A is a connected subset of X.
    - C is a component of X \ A.

    The solution to this problem is a known result in continuum theory.
    The space X \ C consists of at least one component, the one that contains the connected set A.
    Let's call this the main component.
    
    Number of main components (containing A) = 1

    The other components, if they exist, must be disjoint from A. It has been proven that,
    under the given conditions, there can be at most two other components.
    
    Maximum number of other components = 2
    
    Therefore, the largest total number of components is the sum of the main component
    and the maximum possible number of other components.
