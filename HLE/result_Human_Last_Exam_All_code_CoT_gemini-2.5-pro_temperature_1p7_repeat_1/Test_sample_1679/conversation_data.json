    "My plan is to identify the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture that features a scene in a city with a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n1.  **Identify Luxor Obelisk Locations:** There are two Luxor Obelisks. One is at the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Create a Chronological List of Winners:** I will compile a list of early Best Picture Oscar winners, along with their primary settings.\n3.  **Search for the First Match:** I will programmatically iterate through this chronological list. The first film whose setting is either Paris or Luxor will be the answer. Based on film history, several early winners are set in Paris. I will identify the very first one.\n4.  **Present the Answer:** The code will find and print the title of the winning film.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_obelisk_movie():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Best Picture winner depicting a city with a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    The two Luxor Obelisks are in:\n    1.
