    "To calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can analyze its structure. The field is defined in a way that is highly symmetric around the z-axis. For such fields, the Hopf charge, Q, can be determined by the product of two integer winding numbers: `Q = P * W`.\n\n1.  **Azimuthal Winding Number (P):** This number describes how many times the vector field winds around the z-axis as we make one full circle in the xy-plane. The field's azimuthal angle is given by `f = atan2(y, x)`, which is precisely the definition of the cylindrical coordinate angle `φ`. As we circle the z-axis, `φ` changes by 2π, and so does `f`. This corresponds to a winding number of `P = 1`.\n\n2.  **Polar Winding Number (W):** This number describes the winding of the vector field's polar angle, `G`, in any half-plane containing the z-axis (the `ρ-z` plane in cylindrical coordinates). This winding number is given by the formula `W = |G_max - G_min| / π`, which counts how many times the profile of `G` covers the range from the north pole (`G=0`) to the south pole (`G=π`) of the target sphere.\n\n    *   The polar angle is `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`. To find its range, we need the range of `r2 = sqrt((x² + y² - 0.5)² + z²)`.\n    *   The minimum value of `r2` is 0. This occurs when `z=0` and `x² + y² = 0.5` (a circle in the xy-plane which is the \"core\" of the Hopfion). At this minimum, `G` reaches its maximum value: `G_max = π * exp(0) = π`.\n    *   The maximum value of `r2` is infinity, which occurs as we go infinitely far away from the origin in any direction. In this limit, `G` approaches its minimum value: `G_min = π * exp(-∞) = 0`.\n\n    Therefore, the polar winding number is `W = |π - 0| / π = 1`.\n\nFinally, the total Hopf charge is `Q = P * W = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations to find the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Determine the azimuthal winding number P.\n# The field's azimuthal angle is f = atan2(y, x), which is the same as the\n# cylindrical coordinate phi. As we circle the z-axis, f sweeps 2*pi once.\nP = 1\n\n# Step 2: Determine the polar winding number W.\n# This depends on the range of the polar angle G.\n# G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)\n# We need to find the minimum and maximum of G.\n\n# G is maximum when r2 is minimum.\n# r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)\n# The minimum of r2 is 0 (at the circle x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0).\nr2_min = 0\nG_max = np.pi * np.exp(-10 * r2_min)\n\n# G is minimum when r2 is maximum.\n# The maximum of r2 is infinity (at spatial infinity).\n# r2_max -> infinity\nG_min = 0.0\n\n# Calculate W using the formula W = |G_max - G_min| / PI.\nW = abs(G_max - G_min) / np.pi\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total Hopf charge Q = P * W.\nQ = P * W\n\n# Print the results following the formula Q = P * W\nprint(\"The Hopf charge Q is calculated as Q = P * W.\")\nprint(f\"Azimuthal winding number, P = {P}\")\nprint(f\"Polar angle G at the structure's core (r2=0), G_max = {G_max:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Polar angle G at spatial infinity (r2=inf), G_min = {G_min:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Polar winding number, W = (|G_max - G_min|) / PI = {W}\")\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{Q:.0f} = {P} * {W:.0f}\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
