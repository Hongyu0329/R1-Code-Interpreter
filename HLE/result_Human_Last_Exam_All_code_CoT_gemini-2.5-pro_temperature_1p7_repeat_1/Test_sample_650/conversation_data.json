    "My plan is to determine the computational time complexity of the provided `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm. I will start by analyzing the algorithm's structure, focusing on the `while` loop, as it is the primary determinant of the algorithm's execution time for large inputs. I will count the number of iterations the loop performs in relation to the input integer `n`. By combining the number of iterations with the fact that the work done in each iteration is constant, I will derive the final time complexity. Finally, I will present this analysis within a Python script that prints a step-by-step explanation and the final answer.\n\nHere are the thinking steps for the analysis:\n1.  **Identify Core Logic:** The algorithm's runtime is dominated by the `while q > 0` loop. The initialization part (Step 1) runs once and takes a constant amount of time, denoted as O(1).\n2.  **Analyze Loop Behavior:** The loop's execution depends on the value of `q`.\n    *   Initially, `x = n` and `q = floor(n/c)`.\n    *   In each iteration, `x` is updated to the previous value of `q`, and then `q` is updated to `floor(x/c)`. This means that with each pass through the loop, the value of the variable `x` is effectively divided by `c`.\n3.  **Determine Number of Iterations:** The loop continues until `q` becomes 0. This occurs when `x` becomes small enough (specifically, when `x < c`). Since `x` starts at `n` and is divided by `c` in each step, the number of iterations `k` required for `n / (c^k)` to become less than `c` is logarithmic.\n4.  **Mathematical Derivation:** The loop runs as long as `q > 0`. In the `k`-th iteration, the value being processed is approximately `n / c^k`. The loop stops when this value becomes less than `c`, meaning the quotient `q` becomes 0. The number of iterations `k` is therefore the number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0. This is given by `k ≈ log_c(n)`.\n5.  **Calculate Total Complexity:** The total time complexity `T(n)` is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the amount of work done per iteration. Since the work inside the loop (assignments, arithmetic) is constant (O(1)), the total complexity is:\n    `T(n) = (Number of Iterations) * (Work per Iteration) = O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n6.  **Final Form:** In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log(n)/log(c)`) and is typically omitted. Thus, the complexity is commonly written as `O(log n)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef print_complexity_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step analysis of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm's\n    computational time complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Computational Time Complexity Analysis of IMAG(n, c):\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"1.
