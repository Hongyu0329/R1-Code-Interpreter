# This script explains the solution to a topology problem by representing
# the logical steps and the final cardinality equation.

# Step 1: Re-framing the problem.
# According to a theorem by J.J. Charatonik, for a hereditarily
# decomposable continuum, the set of non-coastal points is identical
# to the set of its endpoints.
# Therefore, the question becomes: What is the maximum number of endpoints
# a hereditarily decomposable continuum can have?

# Step 2: Constructing a maximal example.
# We can construct a space called the "Cantor fan", which is a dendrite
# and therefore hereditarily decomposable. Its endpoints correspond to the
# points of the standard Cantor set.

# Step 3: Determining the cardinality of the Cantor set.
# The cardinality of the Cantor set is 2 raised to the power of the
# cardinality of the set of natural numbers (Aleph-naught, or Aleph_0).
# This is a well-known result from set theory.

# Step 4: Stating the final equation for the cardinality.
# The equation for the cardinality of the set of non-coastal points is symbolic.
base = 2
exponent_name = "Aleph_0 (the cardinality of the set of natural numbers)"
result_name = "c (the cardinality of the continuum)"

print("The problem is to find the largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points.")
print("This is equivalent to finding the largest possible cardinality of the set of endpoints.")
print("\nWe use the Cantor fan as an example space. The number of its endpoints is the cardinality of the Cantor set.")
print("The equation for this cardinality is:")
print(f"  ({base}) ^ ({exponent_name}) = {result_name}")

print("\nHere are the components of the final equation:")
print(f"Base of the power: {base}")
print(f"Exponent of the power: The cardinality {exponent_name}")

# This cardinality, c, is the largest possible, as the entire space
# can be embedded in a Euclidean space and thus cannot have more than c points.
