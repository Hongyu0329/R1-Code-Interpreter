    "To solve this problem, we need to design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. The goal of a deadbeat observer is to make the state observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k)` equal to zero in the shortest possible number of steps.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Observer Dynamics**: The observer's state `x̂(k)` evolves according to the equation `x̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C x̂(k))`. The estimation error `e(k)` dynamics are then given by `e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`.\n\n2.  **Deadbeat Design Objective**: To make the error `e(k)` vanish as quickly as possible, the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent. This is achieved by placing all its eigenvalues (poles) at the origin (zero). The desired characteristic polynomial for `(A - LC)` is therefore `λ^n = λ^4 = 0`.\n\n3.  **Pole Placement**: The task of finding the observer gain matrix `L` that places the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` at the desired locations is a pole placement problem. Since our system has multiple outputs (the matrix `C` has two rows), this is a multi-output pole placement problem.\n\n4.  **Method using Duality**: A standard method to design an observer is to use the principle of duality. We can find the gain `L` by solving an equivalent state-feedback pole placement problem for the dual system, which is described by the pair `(A.T, C.T)`. We need to find a gain `K` such that the eigenvalues of `(A.T - C.T K)` are at the desired locations (all zero). The observer gain matrix is then given by `L = K.T`.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: We will use Python with the `control` library, which has a reliable function `control.place` for solving pole placement problems. We will define the system matrices `A` and `C`, specify the desired poles at `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and use the function to calculate the gain `L`. Finally, we will print the resulting gain matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport control as ct\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function designs a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system\n    by placing all observer poles at the origin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices\n    A = np.array([\n        [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [ 1, 0, 0, 2],\n        [ 0, 1, 0, -1],\n        [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n    ])\n    C = np.array([\n        [1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1]\n    ])\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # For a deadbeat observer, all desired eigenvalues (poles) are at the origin.\n    desired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n    # We design the observer by performing pole placement on the dual system (A.T, C.T).\n    # We find a gain K_T (denoted as K in control theory literature) such that\n    # the eigenvalues of (A.T - C.T @ K_T) are the desired_poles.\n    # The observer gain L is then the transpose of this gain matrix.\n    try:\n        # The control.place function returns the gain for the dual system (A.T - C.T @ K)\n        # where K is our L.T\n        L_transpose = ct.place(A.T, C.T, desired_poles)\n        \n        # The observer gain matrix is the transpose of the calculated gain.\n        L = L_transpose.T\n\n        print(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\n        # The instruction asks to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n        # We interpret this as printing the final gain matrix L.\n        print(L)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not compute the observer gain.
