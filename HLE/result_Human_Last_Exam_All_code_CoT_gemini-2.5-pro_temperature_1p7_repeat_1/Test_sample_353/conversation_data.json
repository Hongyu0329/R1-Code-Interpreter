    "To find the $A(\\alpha)$-stability angle for the BDF4 method, we need to analyze its stability region in the complex plane.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Stability Polynomial:** The BDF4 method applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ gives a characteristic stability polynomial. Let $z = h\\lambda$.\n2.  **Stability Region Boundary:** The boundary of the stability region is found by setting the roots of the stability polynomial to have a modulus of one, i.e., $\\xi = e^{i\\theta}$. This gives a curve $z(\\theta)$ in the complex plane.\n3.  **A($\\alpha$)-Stability Angle:** The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangent to the stability boundary curve that passes through the origin. This occurs at a point $z(\\theta_0)$ where the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is extremized. The condition for this is that the complex number $\\frac{\\xi \\rho'(\\xi)}{\\rho(\\xi)}$ is real for $\\xi = e^{i\\theta_0}$, where $\\rho(\\xi)$ is the characteristic polynomial of the method for $z=0$.\n4.  **Solving for the Angle:** This condition leads to a polynomial equation in $c = \\cos(\\theta_0)$. We will solve this equation for $c_0$.\n5.  **Calculating Coordinates:** With the value of $c_0$, we can compute the coordinates $(x_0, y_0)$ of the tangent point $z(\\theta_0)$.\n6.  **Final Angle:** The stability angle $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = \\arctan(-y_0/x_0)$, as the stability region lies in the left half-plane.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  The BDF4 method is given by:\n    $\\frac{25}{12}y_{n+4} - 4y_{n+3} + 3y_{n+2} - \\frac{4}{3}y_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{4}y_n = hf(t_{n+4}, y_{n+4})$.\n    Applying this to $y'=\\lambda y$, with $z=h\\lambda$ and $y_n=\\xi^n$, we get the stability equation:\n    $(\\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}) - z\\xi^4 = 0$.\n\n2.  The characteristic polynomial for $z=0$ is $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$. The stability boundary is given by $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta})/e^{i4\\theta}$.\n\n3.  The condition for the tangent to $z(\\theta)$ to pass through the origin leads to finding $\\theta_0$ such that $\\text{Im}(\\frac{e^{i\\theta_0} \\rho'(e^{i\\theta_0})}{\\rho(e^{i\\theta_0})}) = 0$. This condition can be shown to lead to the following cubic equation for $c = \\cos(\\theta_0)$:\n    $50c^3 - 136c^2 + 123c - 40 = 0$.\n\n4.  We solve this cubic equation to find the correct root $c_0$ in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\n5.  The coordinates $(x_0, y_0)$ of the tangent point $z(\\theta_0)$ can be expressed as polynomials in $c_0 = \\cos(\\theta_0)$ and $s_0 = \\sin(\\theta_0) = \\sqrt{1-c_0^2}$:\n    $x_0(c_0) = 2c_0^4 - \\frac{16}{3}c_0^3 + 4c_0^2 - \\frac{2}{3}$\n    $y_0(c_0) = s_0 \\left(-2c_0^3 + \\frac{16}{3}c_0^2 - 5c_0 + \\frac{8}{3}\\right)$\n\n6.  The angle $\\alpha$ is then $\\alpha = \\arctan(-y_0/x_0)$. The following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_bdf4_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
