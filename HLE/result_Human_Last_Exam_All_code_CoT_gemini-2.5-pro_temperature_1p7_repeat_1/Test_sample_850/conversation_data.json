    "This problem requires a nuanced understanding of crystallographic symmetry and physical properties. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    The user wants to identify crystal classes that have three specific properties simultaneously:\n    *   **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means it must possess at least one improper rotation axis (also called a rotoinversion axis). This includes a center of inversion (`-1`) or a mirror plane (`m`).\n    *   **Non-polar:** The crystal has no unique direction along which a vector property (like pyroelectricity) could exist. Formally, a point group is non-polar if it contains a center of symmetry, or if for every direction, there is a symmetrically equivalent anti-parallel direction. The ten polar classes are `1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm`.\n    *   **Optically Active:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n2.  **Address the Apparent Contradiction:**\n    There is a common, simplified definition stating that optical activity is exclusive to chiral structures. Since an achiral structure is the opposite of a chiral one, this would imply no crystal class can satisfy the conditions, leading to an empty set.\n\n    However, a more rigorous analysis based on tensor physics provides a more nuanced view. Optical activity is governed by the gyration tensor, `g_ij`.\n    *   A crystal is optically active (or \"gyrotropic\") if its symmetry allows for at least one non-zero component in this tensor.\n    *   The gyration tensor is zero for any crystal with a center of symmetry. This means optical activity is only possible in the 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups.\n    *   Crucially, while the simplest cases of optical activity are in chiral crystals, some achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystals also have non-zero components in their gyration tensor. This allows them to exhibit optical activity, though often only when light propagates along specific directions.\n\n3.  **Establish the Criteria for the Code:**\n    Based on the more rigorous physical definition, we can search for classes that meet these conditions:\n    *   **Achiral:** The class is not one of the 11 purely rotational (chiral) point groups.\n    *   **Non-polar:** The class is not one of the 10 polar point groups.\n    *   **Optically Active (Gyrotropic):** The class is non-centrosymmetric and its symmetry does not force all components of the gyration tensor to be zero. The classes that permit optical activity are the 11 chiral classes plus three specific achiral classes: `-4`, `-42m`, and `-43m`.\n\n4.  **Plan the Python Script:**\n    *   Create a data structure (e.g., a list of tuples or dictionaries) containing all 32 crystal classes and their relevant properties (achiral, non-polar, optically active).\n    *   Iterate through this data.\n    *   For each class, apply a logical test to see if it meets all three conditions.\n    *   Collect the names of the classes that pass the test.\n    *   Print the final list of qualifying crystal classes.\n\nThis plan directly translates into the Python code below.\n\n```python\ndef find_special_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\n    This solution is based on the following definitions:\n    1. Chiral Classes (Enantiomorphic): Have only proper rotation axes. There are 11:\n       1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432.\n       An ACHIRAL class is any class NOT in this list.\n\n    2. Polar Classes: Possess a unique vector direction. There are 10:\n       1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n       A NON-POLAR class is any class NOT in this list.\n\n    3. Optically Active (Gyrotropic) Classes: Permit non-zero components in the gyration tensor.\n       This requires the class to be non-centrosymmetric.\n       The classes are the 11 chiral ones plus 3 specific achiral ones: -4, -42m, -43m.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for all 32 point groups.
