Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x). We want to find the cardinality of S, denoted as |S|.

Step 1: Analyze the properties of f.
 - Injectivity: Suppose f(x1) = f(x2). Applying f to both sides gives f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which by the given equation means exp(x1) = exp(x2). Since the exponential function is one-to-one, we must have x1 = x2. Therefore, f is an injective (one-to-one) function.
 - Continuity: The problem statement specifies that f must be continuous.
 - Monotonicity: A key theorem in real analysis states that any continuous and injective function mapping R to R must be strictly monotonic. Thus, f must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

Step 2: Rule out the case of f being strictly decreasing.
 - If f were strictly decreasing, then as a continuous function from R to R, it would have to have a unique fixed point, i.e., a point x0 such that f(x0) = x0.
 - Applying the function f to this fixed point equation gives f(f(x0)) = f(x0). Since f(x0) = x0, we have f(f(x0)) = x0.
 - However, the problem's equation states f(f(x0)) = exp(x0).
 - This implies that the fixed point x0 must satisfy x0 = exp(x0).
 - The equation x = exp(x) has no real solutions (as exp(x) > x for all real x).
 - This contradiction proves that no such strictly decreasing function f can exist.
 - Therefore, any solution f must be strictly increasing.

Step 3: Construct the family of strictly increasing solutions.
For an increasing solution f, we can establish the following:
 - A general method for constructing fractional iterates (which f is, as a "half-iterate" of exp) shows that the solutions are not unique.
 - The construction of a particular solution f depends on two arbitrary choices:
   1. A real number L < 0. It can be shown that for any increasing solution f, the limit as x approaches -infinity of f(x) is L, and f(L) = 0. Any number L from the interval (-infinity, 0) can be chosen.
   2. A continuous, strictly increasing function phi that maps the interval [0, exp(L)] to [exp(L), 1]. This function 'phi' defines the behavior of f on a starting interval, which then uniquely determines f on R.

Step 4: Determine the cardinality of the set of solutions.
The number of possible solutions corresponds to the number of ways we can make the arbitrary choices in the construction.
 - The number of choices for the real number L in (-infinity, 0) is the cardinality of the continuum, c (which is the size of the set of real numbers R).
 - For each choice of L, the number of choices for the continuous, strictly increasing function 'phi' from one interval to another is also the cardinality of the continuum, c.

Since different choices for L or 'phi' result in different functions f, the total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of these choices.
|S| = c * c = c.
