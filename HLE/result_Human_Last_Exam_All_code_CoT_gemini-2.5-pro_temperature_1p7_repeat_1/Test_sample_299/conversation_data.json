    "This is a fascinating problem that delves into the properties of functional equations. The task is to find the number of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$. The number we are looking for is the cardinality of this set of functions.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will analyze the fundamental properties of any function $f$ that could be a solution. This includes checking for injectivity and monotonicity.\n2.  I will rule out one of the monotonicity cases (decreasing functions) by showing it leads to a contradiction.\n3.  Then, for the remaining case (increasing functions), I will outline a method to construct such functions.\n4.  Finally, by analyzing the degrees of freedom in this construction, I will determine the cardinality of the set of possible solutions.\n\nThe reasoning is purely mathematical, but as per your request, I will provide a Python script that prints the detailed explanation and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_cardinality_of_function_set():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a detailed explanation to determine the cardinality\n    of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nLet S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x). We want to find the cardinality of S, denoted as |S|.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the properties of f.\n - Injectivity: Suppose f(x1) = f(x2). Applying f to both sides gives f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which by the given equation means exp(x1) = exp(x2). Since the exponential function is one-to-one, we must have x1 = x2. Therefore, f is an injective (one-to-one) function.\n - Continuity: The problem statement specifies that f must be continuous.\n - Monotonicity: A key theorem in real analysis states that any continuous and injective function mapping R to R must be strictly monotonic. Thus, f must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nStep 2: Rule out the case of f being strictly decreasing.\n - If f were strictly decreasing, then as a continuous function from R to R, it would have to have a unique fixed point, i.e., a point x0 such that f(x0) = x0.\n - Applying the function f to this fixed point equation gives f(f(x0)) = f(x0). Since f(x0) = x0, we have f(f(x0)) = x0.\n - However, the problem's equation states f(f(x0)) = exp(x0).\n - This implies that the fixed point x0 must satisfy x0 = exp(x0).\n - The equation x = exp(x) has no real solutions (as exp(x) > x for all real x).\n - This contradiction proves that no such strictly decreasing function f can exist.\n - Therefore, any solution f must be strictly increasing.\n\nStep 3: Construct the family of strictly increasing solutions.\nFor an increasing solution f, we can establish the following:\n - A general method for constructing fractional iterates (which f is, as a \"half-iterate\" of exp) shows that the solutions are not unique.\n - The construction of a particular solution f depends on two arbitrary choices:\n   1. A real number L < 0. It can be shown that for any increasing solution f, the limit as x approaches -infinity of f(x) is L, and f(L) = 0. Any number L from the interval (-infinity, 0) can be chosen.\n   2. A continuous, strictly increasing function phi that maps the interval [0, exp(L)] to [exp(L), 1]. This function 'phi' defines the behavior of f on a starting interval, which then uniquely determines f on R.\n\nStep 4: Determine the cardinality of the set of solutions.\nThe number of possible solutions corresponds to the number of ways we can make the arbitrary choices in the construction.\n - The number of choices for the real number L in (-infinity, 0) is the cardinality of the continuum, c (which is the size of the set of real numbers R).\n - For each choice of L, the number of choices for the continuous, strictly increasing function 'phi' from one interval to another is also the cardinality of the continuum, c.\n\nSince different choices for L or 'phi' result in different functions f, the total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of these choices.\n|S| = c * c = c.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n    \n    print(\"The final equation given is f(f(x)) = exp(x).\")\n    print(\"In this equation, the number 1 is the coefficient of x, and the number e (Euler's number, approx. {}) is the base of the exponential.\".format(math.e))\n\nfind_cardinality_of_function_set()\n```\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum>>>"
