    "The user wants me to find the next number in a given sequence.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** The sequence `111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, ...` does not seem to follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. The values fluctuate, and there are many repetitions.\n\n2.  **Look for non-mathematical patterns:**\n    *   Could the numbers be ASCII codes? `chr(111) = 'o'`, `chr(67) = 'C'`, `chr(49) = '1'`. However, numbers like 142 and 155 are outside the standard printable ASCII range, and converting the whole sequence to characters does not yield a recognizable text.\n    *   Could they be related to a keyboard layout or some other encoding? This seems unlikely to be solved without more specific domain knowledge.\n\n3.  **Search for a recurrence relation (an \"equation\"):** The prompt strongly hints at a \"final equation\" and asks to \"output each number\" in it. This suggests the next number is a function of the previous numbers.\n    *   Let's test simple relations like `A[n] = A[n-1] + A[n-2]` or `A[n] = A[n-1] - A[n-2]`. None of these consistently work.\n    *   A crucial observation is the subsequence `..., 67, 67, 67, 93, ...`. Here, the function `f(67, 67)` would have to yield `67` one time and `93` the next. This proves that any simple function `f(A[n-1], A[n-2])` cannot be the sole rule for the entire sequence.\n\n4.  **Look for simpler, high-level patterns:** Instead of a single complex mathematical formula, let's look for recognizable patterns in the sequence's structure.\n    *   The pattern `X, Y, X` appears multiple times:\n        *   `111, 142, 111`\n        *   `49, 155, 49`\n    *   The sequence ends with `... 124, 36, 124`. This is another instance of the `X, Y, X` pattern, where `X=124` and `Y=36`.\n\n5.  **Formulate a hypothesis:** The most logical and simple continuation of an `X, Y, X` pattern is `Y`, which would create an alternating sequence `X, Y, X, Y`.\n    *   Applying this to the end of the sequence `124, 36, 124`, the next number should be `36`.\n\n6.  **Construct the code:** The Python code will implement this pattern-matching logic. It will:\n    *   Identify the last three numbers.\n    *   Check if they match the `X, Y, X` pattern.\n    *   If they do, determine the next number to be `Y`.\n    *   As requested, the code will print the numbers involved in this \"equation\" or logical rule (`124, 36, 124`) and the resulting next number (`36`).\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the next number in the sequence by identifying a recurring pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n\n    # The rule is based on pattern recognition.
