    "Based on established neuroanatomical studies of cephalopods, which are highly conserved across species like the dwarf cuttlefish, I will identify the brain regions located posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe. The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior subesophageal mass. My plan is to access this anatomical information and then present the answer using a Python script as requested. The script will simply print the name of the relevant brain region.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_region():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions located adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \n    The cuttlefish brain, while complex, has a well-documented structure.\n    The palliovisceral lobe is a large structure in the posterior subesophageal mass.\n    Anatomically, the lobes that are situated just posterior to the palliovisceral lobe,\n    and are responsible for the fast-escape jet propulsion system, are the giant fiber lobes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    posterior_region = \"Giant fiber lobes\"\n    \n    print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the: {posterior_region}\")\n\nfind_adjacent_brain_region()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the: Giant fiber lobes>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
