    "My plan is to first identify the historical figure who was the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the specified year, 1461, by consulting historical records. Since this is a direct factual query, I will then create a Python script. This script will store the name of the judge, the year, and the city's name in variables. Finally, it will print a clear, formatted sentence that answers your question, including the year as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_historical_judge():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n    The information is based on historical data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the known historical data\n    year = 1461\n    city_name_hungarian = \"Bártfa\"\n    city_name_slovak = \"Bardejov\"\n    judge_name = \"Alexius\"\n\n    # The prompt requires outputting the number, so we will include the year in the final sentence.\n    # The equation here is the statement of fact.\n    print(f\"In the year {year}, the judge of {city_name_hungarian} (now known as {city_name_slovak}) was {judge_name}.\")\n\n# Call the function to display the answer\nget_historical_judge()\n```\n<<<Alexius>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Who was the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
