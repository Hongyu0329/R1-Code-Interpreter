    Identifies the starting material for the given reaction.
    The reaction described is a base-catalyzed intramolecular aldol condensation,
    a key step in the Robinson annulation sequence. The product is a specific
    isomer of a well-known class of bicyclic ketones. The most plausible
    single-compound starting material that undergoes such a cyclization with
    potassium hydroxide is 2-methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione,
    a classic intermediate in steroid synthesis.
