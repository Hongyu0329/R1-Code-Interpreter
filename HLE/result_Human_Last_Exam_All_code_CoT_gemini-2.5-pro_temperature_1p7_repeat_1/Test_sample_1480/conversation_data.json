    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the given membership function values. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two given values, `Phi_k(x′)` and `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm, which means finding the minimum of these two values.\n3.  Print the full calculation and the resulting rule activation level.\n\n```python\n# Define the given membership values\nphi_k_x_prime = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm operation is a form of fuzzy 'AND'. The most common t-norm is the\n# minimum operator, which we will use here to find the rule activation level.\nrule_activation_level = min(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\n\n# Print the final equation with the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j_y_j}) = {rule_activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
