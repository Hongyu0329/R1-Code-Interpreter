    "The user wants me to analyze a Java program, determine if it solves the given \"Bit++\" problem, and if not, provide a correct solution and an efficiency analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the provided Java code:** I will check if the Java program correctly handles all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. The valid statements are `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, and `X--`.\n2.  **Determine Correctness:** The Java code checks for `test.contains(\"++X\")` and `test.contains(\"--X\")`. It fails to account for the `X++` and `X--` cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect. The answer must start with 'N'.\n3.  **Design an Optimal C Solution (for analysis):** As requested, I will design the most efficient C program to calculate the values of `x` (number of character comparisons) and `y` (memory usage).\n    *   An efficient C program can read each 3-character statement and determine the operation by checking just one character. For example, the character at index 1 (`statement[1]`) will always be either `+` or `-`. This is the most efficient check.\n4.  **Calculate `x` (character comparisons):** Based on the optimal C design, for 100 instructions, the program would perform exactly one character comparison per instruction. Thus, `x = 1 * 100 = 100`.\n5.  **Calculate `y` (memory usage):** The C program requires variables for the number of statements (`n`), the result (`x`), a loop counter, and a buffer for the statement string. To minimize memory, we can use `short` integers (2 bytes) where possible, as the value of `n` is at most 150. A minimal set of variables would be: `short n, x, i;` and `char statement[4];`. The total memory for these variables is `2 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10` bytes. Thus, `y = 10`.\n6.  **Provide the Python Solution:** Finally, I will write a correct and robust Python program that solves the problem, as requested by the prompt's formatting rules. The program will read the number of statements, then loop that many times, check if a `+` exists in the input line to determine the operation, update a counter, and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_bit_plus_plus():\n  \"\"\"\n  Solves the Bit++ problem by reading statements from standard input.\n  The initial value of x is 0. It is increased for statements containing '++'\n  and decreased for statements containing '--'.\n  \"\"\"\n  try:\n    # Read the number of statements.\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Initialize the variable x to 0.\n    x = 0\n    \n    # Process each statement.\n    for _ in range(n):\n      statement = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n      \n      # The problem guarantees that each statement contains either '++' or '--'.\n      # We can check for the presence of a '+' character to determine the operation.\n      if '+' in statement:\n        x += 1\n      else:\n        x -= 1\n        \n    # Print the final value of x.\n    print(x)\n    \n  except (ValueError, IndexError):\n    # Handle potential empty input or malformed numbers.\n    print(\"Invalid input.
