# The defect group D is elementary abelian of order 16, which is (Z/2Z)^4.
# This can be viewed as a 4-dimensional vector space over the field F_2.
# The inertial quotient E is a subgroup of Out(D) = Aut(D)/Inn(D).
# Since D is abelian, Inn(D) is trivial, so E is a subgroup of Aut(D).
# Aut(D) is isomorphic to the general linear group GL(4, F_2).
# The highest possible order for E is therefore the order of GL(4, F_2).

# The formula for the order of GL(n, F_q) is:
# |GL(n, F_q)| = (q^n - 1)(q^n - q)...(q^n - q^(n-1))

n = 4
q = 2

# Calculate the terms of the product
term1 = q**n - q**0
term2 = q**n - q**1
term3 = q**n - q**2
term4 = q**n - q**3

# Calculate the final order
order = term1 * term2 * term3 * term4

# Print the final equation with all numbers and the result
