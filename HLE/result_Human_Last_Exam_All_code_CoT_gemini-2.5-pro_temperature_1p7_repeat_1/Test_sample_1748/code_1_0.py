def solve_rope_riddle():
    """
    Solves the magical rope riddle by finding a unique first cut based on a hidden constraint.

    The problem states:
    - A 60cm rope is cut twice.
    - After each cut, the longer portion shrinks by 25%.
    - Resulting lengths must be integers.
    - It's possible to get a 15cm piece.
    - Question: What is the length of the longer portion after the first cut?

    A simple analysis shows multiple possible answers. The riddle likely implies a unique,
    elegant constraint to single out one solution. We assume this constraint is that
    the amount the longer piece shrinks equals the length of the shorter piece.
