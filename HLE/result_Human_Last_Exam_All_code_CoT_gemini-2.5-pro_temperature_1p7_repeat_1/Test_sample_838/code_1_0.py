Here is the step-by-step explanation of the chemical synthesis:

The starting material is [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, which corresponds to the IUPAC name (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Formation of Product A
--------------------------------------------------
- Reaction: E2 Elimination
- Starting Material: (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane
- Reagents: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically bulky base.
- Explanation: In the presence of a strong, bulky base, secondary alkyl halides undergo elimination via the E2 mechanism. The bulky base has difficulty accessing the internal proton at C2, so it preferentially removes a more accessible proton from the terminal methyl group (C4). This follows the Hofmann rule, leading to the formation of the less substituted alkene. This elimination reaction destroys the only chiral center in the molecule.
- Product (A): 4-phenylbut-1-ene

Equation: (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane ---[t-BuOK]--> 4-phenylbut-1-ene

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Formation of Product B
--------------------------------------------------
- Reaction: Hydroboration-Oxidation
- Starting Material (A): 4-phenylbut-1-ene
- Reagents: 1. Borane in THF (BH3/THF), 2. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH).
- Explanation: This is a two-step process that adds water across a double bond. The reaction proceeds with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity, meaning the hydroxyl (-OH) group is added to the less-substituted carbon of the double bond.
- Product (B): 4-phenylbutan-1-ol

Equation: 4-phenylbut-1-ene ---[1. BH3/THF, 2. H2O2/NaOH]--> 4-phenylbutan-1-ol

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Formation of Final Product C
--------------------------------------------------
- Reaction: Alcohol Bromination
- Starting Material (B): 4-phenylbutan-1-ol
- Reagent: Phosphorus tribromide (PBr3).
- Explanation: Phosphorus tribromide is a standard reagent used to convert a primary alcohol into a primary alkyl bromide. The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, substituting the -OH group with a bromine atom.
- Product (C): 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane

Equation: 4-phenylbutan-1-ol ---[PBr3]--> 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane

--------------------------------------------------
Final Product (C): Identity and Chirality
--------------------------------------------------
- IUPAC Name: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane

- Chirality Explanation: The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is an achiral molecule. A molecule is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image, which is the case here. The starting material was chiral, but the stereocenter was destroyed in the first step (E2 elimination) to form an achiral alkene (Product A). Since all subsequent intermediates and reactions did not introduce any new chiral centers, the final product is also achiral. A chiral center is an atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups, and no such center exists in 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.
