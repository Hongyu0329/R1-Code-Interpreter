    # The total force F applied by the monk has two components at the final moment:
    # 1. Force to support the rope's full weight: F_weight = m * g
    # 2. Force to give momentum to the mass being lifted from rest. This is calculated
    #    as F_momentum = speed * (rate of mass lifting) = v * (dm/dt).
    #    The rate of mass lifting is dm/dt = (mass_per_length) * speed = (m/l) * v.
    #    So, F_momentum = v * (m/l) * v = (m * v^2) / l.
    #
    # We assume the acceleration is zero at this final instant, as the goal
    # was to achieve speed v, not to accelerate past it.
    #
    # Total Force F = F_weight + F_momentum.
