    The core of this problem lies in the statement "adversary has complete knowledge of... the encryption keys." The foundation of all confidentiality-providing cryptographic systems is the secrecy of the key. Let's analyze why the other options fail under this condition:

    A, D, E (Quantum Methods): These methods use quantum mechanics to generate or distribute keys (QKD, Quantum OTP) or perform encryption. However, they all result in a key that must be kept secret. If the adversary knows the final key (e.g., the one-time pad or the quantum bit states), the security is broken.

    B, C (Key Management): Fast Key Rotation and Perfect Forward Secrecy are strategies to limit the damage of a key compromise. They either shorten a key's lifespan or protect past/future sessions from a current compromise. They do not, however, secure a session if the key for that specific session is known to the adversary.

    Conclusion: If an adversary knows the key, they can decrypt the data. The security of the system is fundamentally compromised. Kerckhoffs's Principle itself hinges on the key being the *only* secret part. If that secret is lost, so is security. Therefore, maintaining security under the described conditions is theoretically impossible.
