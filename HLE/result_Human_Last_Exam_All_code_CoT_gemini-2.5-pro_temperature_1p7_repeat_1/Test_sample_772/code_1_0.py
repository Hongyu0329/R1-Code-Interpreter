def solve_alpha():
    """
    This script calculates the exponent alpha based on the properties of the group G = SO(3).

    The problem asks for the exponent alpha in the relation n(N) ~ N^alpha, where n(N)
    is the covering number for the group SO(3). The theoretical result is that
    alpha = 1/d, where d is the dimension of the group.

    The plan is to:
    1. Define the base dimension 'n' for the group SO(n), which is 3 in this case.
    2. Calculate the dimension of the ambient space of n x n matrices.
    3. Calculate the number of constraints imposed by the orthogonality condition (A^T * A = I).
    4. Compute the dimension of SO(3) by subtracting the constraints from the ambient dimension.
    5. Compute alpha as the reciprocal of the group's dimension.
