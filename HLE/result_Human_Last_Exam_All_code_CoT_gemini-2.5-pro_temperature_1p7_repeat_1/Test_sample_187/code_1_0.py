    1.  The use of '^' for exponentiation in a .py file, where it's a bitwise XOR operator.
    2.  The use of '/' for division of integers, which results in a float instead of an exact rational number as required by the SageMath context.
    3.  The use of '^' on a SageMath symbolic expression, which raises a TypeError.
