    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that provides the details of the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the earliest recorded date, which is found on an artifact known as Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\n2.  The date is recorded using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n3.  I will define Python variables for each component of this Long Count date (B'ak'tun, K'atun, Tun, Winal, and K'in).\n4.  I will also specify the corresponding date in our modern Gregorian calendar.\n5.  Finally, I will use `print()` statements to present all of this information in a clear and complete sentence, making sure to show each number of the Long Count date as requested.\n\n```python\n# The task is to find the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization\n# in an aboriginal writing system. The answer is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\n\n# Define the components of the Long Count date.\nbaktun = 7\nkatun = 16\ntun = 3\nwinal = 2\nkin = 13\n\n# Define other relevant information.\nartifact_name = \"Stela 2\"\nlocation = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico\"\ngregorian_equivalent = \"December 7, 36 BC\"\n\n# Print the final answer, detailing the date and its components.\nprint(f\"The earliest known date from a pre-Columbian civilization is found on {artifact_name} from {location}.\")\nprint(f\"The date is written in the Long Count system as:\")\nprint(f\"The full date is: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis breaks down into the following units of time:\")\nprint(f\"- {baktun} B'ak'tuns\")\nprint(f\"- {katun} K'atuns\")\nprint(f\"- {tun} Tuns\")\nprint(f\"- {winal} Winals\")\nprint(f\"- {kin} K'ins\")\nprint(f\"\\nThis date corresponds to {gregorian_equivalent} in the Gregorian calendar.\")\n```\n<<<December 7, 36 BC>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in the aboriginal writing system? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
