# The task is to identify the false statement among the given choices.
# Statement A is true. Nicola Pisano was influenced by Roman sculpture.
# Statement C is true. The pulpit is hexagonal.
# Statement D is true. The figure of Fortitude is a classical-style nude.
# Statement E is true in an art-historical interpretive sense.
# Statement G is true. Triple colonettes separate the panels.
# Statement H is true. The pulpit is free-standing.
# Statement I is true. The Crucifixion is one of the panels.
# Statements B, F, and J contain factual errors.
# Statement B states the sculptor is "Nicola Picasso", which is incorrect. The sculptor is Nicola Pisano.
# Statement F states there are six narrative carvings, but there are only five.
# Statement J states three columns rest on lions, but only two do.

# Among these false statements, confusing Nicola Pisano with Pablo Picasso (B)
# is the most significant and fundamental error. It confuses artists, eras,
# and nationalities. This is likely the intended false statement.
