def solve_cyclic_element_intersection():
    """
    Solves the problem about the maximum cardinality of the set of intersection points
    on a cyclic element.

    This problem leads to a paradox in classic topology:
    1. A theorem by Whyburn implies the number of such intersection points must be finite.
    2. It is possible to construct a space where this number is equal to any finite integer 'n'.

    This means there is no finite maximum. However, we can demonstrate a simple, non-trivial case.
    Let's consider a Peano continuum `X` made of three cyclic elements in a chain: `T1 - S - T2`.
    For example, three circles where T1 touches S at p1, and S touches T2 at p2.

    S is our chosen cyclic element.
    The other cyclic elements are {T1, T2}.

    The set of points on S that also belong to other cyclic elements is the union of
    the intersections of S with each of the other elements.

    # S intersects T1 at a single point, p1

    # S intersects T2 at a single point, p2
    # For the cardinality to be maximal, p1 and p2 must be distinct.

    # The set of points on S that belong to some OTHER cyclic element
