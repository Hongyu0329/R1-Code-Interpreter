    "Of course, let's break this down.\n\nThe task is to identify the dance from the list where overturning a Reverse Turn is technically impossible without breaking the fundamental rules of that dance. A Reverse Turn is a standard figure that turns to the left. \"Overturning\" means rotating more than the standard amount for that figure. The key is the phrase \"without disregarding the technique.\"\n\nHere is the plan to solve this:\n1.  Analyze the core technique of each of the five dances listed, specifically concerning rotation and body mechanics.\n2.  The \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) share principles of CBM (Contra Body Movement), body sway, and rise and fall. These elements create momentum and allow for flexibility in the amount of turn. Overturning a figure in these dances is often possible by increasing the sway or CBM, which is an exaggeration but not a violation of the core technique.\n3.  The Tango has a fundamentally different technique. It is characterized by no rise and fall, no body sway, a staccato action, and a compact, grounded posture.\n4.  By comparing the technique of the Tango Reverse Turn to that of the swing dances, we can determine in which dance the technical rules are so rigid that they physically prevent overturning. The structure of the Tango Reverse Turn, with its specific foot placements and lack of sway, inherently limits the rotation possible.\n\nBased on this plan, I will write a Python script to present the analysis and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the technical aspects of ballroom dances to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?\"\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer = 'C'\n\n    print(\"The user's question is: \" + question)\n    print(\"\\nHere is an analysis of the options:\")\n\n    analysis = {\n        'Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep':\n            \"These are 'swing' dances.
