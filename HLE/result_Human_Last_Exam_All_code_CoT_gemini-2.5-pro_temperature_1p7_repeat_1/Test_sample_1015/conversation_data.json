    "This is a knowledge-based question about ballet technique. I will provide an explanation of the core differences between the two methods and then select the best answer choice. The Python script below will print out this explanation for clarity.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the movement *cambré derrière* (bending backward) in the context of both the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods.\n2.  Compare the key technical elements of the movement in each style, such as the use of the spine, head, arms, and hips.\n3.  The most significant and defining difference is the use of the hips. Vaganova training emphasizes keeping the hips square and lifting up and over from the upper back. In contrast, the Balanchine style is famous for its characteristic push of the hips forward during the *cambré derrière*.\n4.  Evaluate the given answer choices based on this analysis to determine the most accurate one.\n5.  Construct a Python script to print the detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ballet_technique_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe most defining technical difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement and action of the hips.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method:** In the Russian Vaganova method, the dancer keeps the hips square and stable over the supporting legs. The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine), with a feeling of lifting the torso up and back. The hips do not press forward; this ensures stability and control.\n\n2.  **Balanchine Method:** The American Balanchine style is characterized by a dynamic push of the hips forward as the upper body bends backward. This creates a visually deeper, more extreme arc and contributes to the speed and 'off-balance' aesthetic for which Balanchine is known.\n\nWhile other elements like head placement (E) and the degree of the backbend (D) also differ, they are largely a result of the fundamental difference in hip placement (B). Therefore, the placement of the hip is the core distinction.\n\"\"\"\n\n    correct_answer_letter = 'B'\n\n    print(question)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Answer Choices:\")\n    for letter, description in choices.items():\n        print(f\"{letter}. {description}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"The most accurate answer is B: {choices[correct_answer_letter]}\")\n\nexplain_ballet_technique_difference()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
