# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the requirements for replicating the Visual Cliff experiment.
# 2. Analyze the requirements for replicating the Swinging Room experiment.
# 3. For each capability (I-V), determine if it is necessary for the "cliff", "room", "both", or "neither" experiment.
# 4. Concatenate the resulting keywords into a single hyphen-separated string as per the instructions.
# 5. Print the final string.

# Analysis Results:
# I. Goal-driven locomotion: cliff
# II. MST analogue (optic flow): both
# III. Relative size evaluation: cliff
# IV. Binocular disparity: cliff
# V. Postural control: room

# Formulate the final answer string
final_answer = "cliff-both-cliff-cliff-room"

# Print the final answer
print(final_answer)
