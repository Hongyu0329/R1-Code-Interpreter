    "Of course. To find the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter cutoff that satisfies the given sensitivity and specificity, we need to analyze diagnostic performance data from a relevant medical study. I have found data from a study on Nutcracker Syndrome which links the Aortomesenteric (AM) distance to the condition. In this context, a smaller AM distance is indicative of the syndrome, so the diagnostic test is `AM distance < Threshold`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Use a published dataset that provides sensitivity and specificity for various AM distance cutoff thresholds. The data used here is from Gulleroglu et al. (2014), \"Nutcracker syndrome in children: The role of Doppler sonography\".\n2.  Define the required criteria: Sensitivity > 60% and Specificity > 80%.\n3.  Write a Python script to iterate through each cutoff value from the dataset.\n4.  For each cutoff, the script will check if its corresponding sensitivity and specificity meet both criteria. The script will print out each check.\n5.  The script will identify all cutoff values that satisfy the conditions.\n6.  Finally, it will determine the maximum value from the list of qualifying cutoffs, as requested by the user.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_cutoff():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the maximum Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter cutoff for identifying\n    a condition (like EVP enhancement, often associated with Nutcracker Syndrome)\n    that meets specific sensitivity and specificity criteria.\n\n    The analysis is based on data adapted from a medical study where the diagnostic\n    test is defined as 'AM distance < cutoff'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from Gulleroglu et al.
