    "Of course. Here is the thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players. This requires understanding how boss health scales in Terraria.\n2.  **Find the base health:** First, I need the boss's base health in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the official Terraria Wiki, which cross-references the game's source code, the Eye of Cthulhu's health in single-player Expert Mode is **3,640**.\n3.  **Find the multiplayer scaling rule:** Next, I need to find out how health changes with more players. For Expert Mode, the rule is that a boss's health increases by **35%** of its single-player Expert Mode health for each additional player (i.e., every player after the first).\n4.  **Calculate the health increase per player:**\n    *   Health increase = 35% of 3,640\n    *   Health increase = 0.35 * 3,640 = **1,274**\n5.  **Formulate the equation:** I can now write a general formula for the boss's health, `H`, as a function of the number of players, `n`.\n    *   The total health is the base health for one player plus the additional health from all other players.\n    *   Number of additional players = `n - 1`\n    *   Total Health `H(n) = (Base Health) + (Number of additional players) * (Health increase per player)`\n    *   Plugging in the numbers: `H(n) = 3640 + (n - 1) * 1274`\n6.  **Analyze the \"infinite players\" condition:** The user specifies an infinite number of players. This means I need to see what happens to the formula as `n` approaches infinity.\n    *   The formula `H(n) = 3640 + (n - 1) * 1274` is a linear equation. As the variable `n` (number of players) increases, the resulting health `H(n)` also increases without any upper bound defined by the game's mechanics.\n    *   Therefore, as the number of players approaches infinity, the boss's health also approaches infinity.\n7.  **Construct the Python code:** The code should clearly explain this conclusion by laying out the formula and its components. It won't calculate a single number but will present the equation and explain the result.\n    *   Define variables for the base health and the increase per player.\n    *   Use `print()` statements to build the explanation step-by-step.\n    *   Clearly print the final equation: `Total Health = 3640 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * 1274`.\n    *   Conclude that due to the linear nature of this formula, the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\n\nThis step-by-step process ensures all parts of the user's request are met, including using code, referencing the game's mechanics, and providing the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\n# Define the base values for the calculation based on Terraria's Expert Mode mechanics.\nbase_health_expert = 3640  # Health for the Eye of Cthulhu with one player.\nscaling_factor_expert = 0.35 # Health increases by 35% for each additional player.\n\n# Calculate the amount of health added for each player after the first.\nhealth_increase_per_player = int(base_health_expert * scaling_factor_expert)\n\nprint(\"To determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu, we use the multiplayer scaling formula from Terraria's source code.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(f\"1. Base Health in Expert Mode (1 player): {base_health_expert}\")\nprint(f\"2. Health Increase per Additional Player: {scaling_factor_expert * 100}% of base health\")\nprint(f\"   Calculation: {base_health_expert} * {scaling_factor_expert} = {health_increase_per_player} health per extra player.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(\"The general formula for health (H) based on the number of players (n) is:\")\nprint(\"H(n) = BaseHealth + (n - 1) * HealthIncreasePerPlayer\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the values for the Eye of Cthulhu:\")\nprint(f\"Total Health = {base_health_expert} + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * {health_increase_per_player}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(\"\\nConclusion for an infinite number of players:\")\nprint(\"The health formula is a linear equation. As the 'NumberOfPlayers' increases, the 'Total Health' increases without any in-game limit.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, with a theoretical infinite number of players, the Eye of Cthulhu's health would also approach infinity.\")\n\n```\n<<<infinity>>>"
