    "The threat to symmetric key encryption from quantum computers comes from Grover's algorithm. While classical computers require, on average, 2^(n-1) operations to brute-force an n-bit key, Grover's algorithm can accomplish the same task in approximately sqrt(2^n), or 2^(n/2), operations.\n\nThis means that a quantum computer provides a quadratic speedup, effectively halving the bit-strength of the symmetric key. To determine the minimum secure key length against a quantum computer, we must start with the currently accepted security level against classical computers and then double it. The current industry standard for strong security is 128 bits (as seen in AES-128). A 128-bit key is considered computationally infeasible to break with classical computers.\n\nTo maintain this 128-bit security level in a post-quantum world, we need to choose a key length 'n' such that its post-quantum strength (n/2) is at least 128.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the target classical security level (128 bits).\n2.  Calculate the required key length to maintain that security level against a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, which means doubling the classical key length.\n3.  Print the explanation and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetric key length needed to resist a quantum computer attack.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The current standard for strong security against classical computers is 128 bits.\n    classical_security_level = 128\n\n    print(f\"To be secure against a classical computer, a symmetric key length of {classical_security_level} bits is considered a strong standard.\")\n    print(\"\\nHowever, a quantum computer can use Grover's algorithm to speed up the key search.\")\n    print(\"This attack effectively halves the key's security strength in bits (n-bit key becomes n/2 bits of security).\")\n    print(f\"To maintain a {classical_security_level}-bit security level against a quantum computer, the key length must be doubled.\")\n\n    # The quantum factor is 2 because Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speedup.\n    quantum_factor = 2\n    quantum_resistant_key_length = classical_security_level * quantum_factor\n\n    # Display the final equation with each number.\n    print(\"\\nThe calculation is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{classical_security_level} * {quantum_factor} = {quantum_resistant_key_length}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a symmetric key needs to be at least {quantum_resistant_key_length} bits long to be considered secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
