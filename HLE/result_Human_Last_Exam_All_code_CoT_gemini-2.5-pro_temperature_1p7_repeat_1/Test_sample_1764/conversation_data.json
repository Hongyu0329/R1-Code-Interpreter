    "My plan is to show that the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0. To do this, I will argue by construction. I will choose a specific finite ultrametric space $X$ and a specific Banach space $B$, and then demonstrate that there are no isometric embeddings from $X$ into $B$. Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, if I can show a case where the number is 0, then 0 must be the smallest possible number.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define Isometric Embedding**: An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ that perfectly preserves distances, meaning for any two points $x_1, x_2$ in $X$, the distance between them, $d(x_1, x_2)$, is equal to the norm of the difference of their images in $B$, $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|$.\n2.  **Choose a specific X and B**: Not all metric spaces can be isometrically embedded into all Banach spaces. I will choose an example where the embedding is impossible.\n    *   For the Banach space $B$, I will choose the simplest one: the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard norm, $\\|x\\| = |x|$. The cardinality of this space is $K=c$ (the continuum).\n    *   For the finite ultrametric space $X$, I will choose a three-point space $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$. For a metric to be an ultrametric on three points, the two largest distances must be equal. I will define the distances as $d(p_1, p_2) = a$, $d(p_1, p_3) = b$, and $d(p_2, p_3) = b$, where we can choose any positive numbers such that $b \\ge a > 0$.\n3.  **Prove non-existence of embedding**: The python code will systematically show that it's impossible to find three points $y_1, y_2, y_3$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the distance conditions $|y_1 - y_2| = a$, $|y_1 - y_3| = b$, and $|y_2 - y_3| = b$.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since no such embedding exists for this specific (and valid) choice of $X$ and $B$, the number of embeddings in this case is 0. Therefore, the smallest possible number of embeddings is 0.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef prove_no_embedding():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that a specific 3-point ultrametric space cannot be\n    isometrically embedded into the Banach space of real numbers (R),\n    proving that the number of such embeddings can be 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let X = {p1, p2, p3} be an ultrametric space.\n    # For it to be ultrametric, among the three distances, the two largest must be equal.\n    # Let's define the distances with two positive numbers, a and b, where b >= a > 0.\n    # For this example, let's pick a=3 and b=5.\n    a = 3\n    b = 5\n    d12 = a  # d(p1, p2)\n    d13 = b  # d(p1, p3)\n    d23 = b  # d(p2, p3)\n    \n    print(f\"Let's choose a 3-point ultrametric space X = {{p1, p2, p3}}.\")\n    print(f\"The distances are d(p1, p2) = {d12}, d(p1, p3) = {d13}, and d(p2, p3) = {d23}.\")\n    print(\"This is an ultrametric space because the two largest distances are equal.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Let's choose the Banach space B to be the real numbers R with the usual absolute value norm.\")\n    print(\"An isometric embedding f: X -> R would require finding three points y1, y2, y3 in R such that:\")\n    print(f\"|y1 - y2| = {d12}\")\n    print(f\"|y1 - y3| = {d13}\")\n    print(f\"|y2 - y3| = {d23}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Since an isometric embedding is invariant under translation of its image,\n    # we can assume the image of p1 is at the origin without loss of generality.\n    y1 = 0\n    print(f\"For simplicity, let the image of p1 be y1 = {y1}.\")\n    \n    # From the first distance condition |y1 - y2| = a:\n    # |0 - y2| = a  =>  y2 can be +a or -a\n    print(f\"From |y1 - y2| = {d12}, we get |{y1} - y2| = {d12}, so y2 must be +{a} or -{a}.\")\n    \n    # From the second distance condition |y1 - y3| = b:\n    # |0 - y3| = b  =>  y3 can be +b or -b\n    print(f\"From |y1 - y3| = {d13}, we get |{y1} - y3| = {d13}, so y3 must be +{b} or -{b}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Now we must check if the third condition, |y2 - y3| = d23, can be satisfied.\")\n    print(\"There are four possible combinations for the values of (y2, y3):\\n\")\n    \n    found_solution = False\n    \n    # Case 1: y2 = a, y3 = b\n    y2_cand, y3_cand = a, b\n    dist = abs(y2_cand - y3_cand)\n    print(f\"Case 1: y2 = {y2_cand}, y3 = {y3_cand}\")\n    print(f\"Check: |{y2_cand} - {y3_cand}| = {dist}.
