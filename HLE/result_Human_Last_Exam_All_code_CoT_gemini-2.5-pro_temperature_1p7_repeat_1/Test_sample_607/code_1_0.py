    print("This implies that the update step, x_{k+1} - x_k, must go to zero. From the equation, this means 'gamma * nabla f(x_k)' must go to zero.")

    print("Analysis: A simple limit argument, similar to the one for gradient descent, would suggest that the limit point must be stationary, as the momentum term 'beta * (x_k - x_{k-1})' goes to zero upon convergence.")
    print("However, this simple argument is famously misleading for the heavy-ball method.")
    print("The optimization literature contains established counterexamples: there are smooth, convex functions for which the heavy-ball method can be shown to converge to a point that is *not* a stationary point.")
    print("This is a known paradoxical behavior caused by the complex dynamics of the momentum term. It is the only algorithm among the choices that exhibits this property.")
