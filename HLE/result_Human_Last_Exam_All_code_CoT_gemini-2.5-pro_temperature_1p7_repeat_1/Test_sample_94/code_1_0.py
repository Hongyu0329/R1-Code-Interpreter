# the concave diffraction grating (which acts like a concave mirror),
# is famously associated with Henry Augustus Rowland.

# While the "microscopy" clue is a better fit for other scientists like
# Jan Evangelista PurkynÄ›, the very specific details of the discovery
# anecdote point to Rowland. It's likely the question conflates the two figures.
