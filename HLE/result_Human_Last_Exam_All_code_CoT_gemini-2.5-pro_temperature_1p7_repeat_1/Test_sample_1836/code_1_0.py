    # The problem asks for the number of ordinals `alpha` for which the
    # order type of Y is at least `alpha`. This is equivalent to finding the
    # cardinality of otp(Y) + 1.

    # We are given a measurable cardinal `kappa`. This implies kappa is an
    # uncountable cardinal and a limit ordinal.
    # The sequence of sets X_n is defined recursively:
    # X_0 = kappa = {alpha | alpha is an ordinal and alpha < kappa}
    # X_n = the set of successor points in the order topology of X_{n-1}.
    # Y = intersection of X_n for n < omega.
    # The statement `Y = \bigcap_{n < \omega}\kappa_n` is interpreted as a typo
    # for `Y = \bigcap_{n < \omega}X_n` with X_0 = kappa.

    # Step 1: Characterize the sets X_n.
    # X_0 = kappa.
    # A point is a "successor point" in a set of ordinals if it has an
    # immediate predecessor within that set.
    
    # For n=1: X_1 is the set of successor points in X_0.
    # The elements of X_0 are {0, 1, 2, ..., omega, omega+1, ...}.
    # The points without an immediate predecessor in X_0 are 0 and the limit ordinals.
    # So, the successor points are the successor ordinals.
    # X_1 = {beta + 1 | beta + 1 < kappa}. Since kappa is a limit ordinal, this is
    # {alpha + 1 | alpha < kappa}.
    
    # For n=2: X_2 is the set of successor points in X_1.
    # An element `gamma` in X_1 is a successor point if its predecessor `gamma-1` is also in X_1.
    # Let `gamma = beta + 1` be in X_1. Its predecessor `beta` must be in X_1.
    # For `beta` to be in X_1, it must be a successor ordinal, i.e., `beta = delta + 1`.
    # So `gamma = (delta + 1) + 1 = delta + 2`.
    # Thus, X_2 = {alpha + 2 | alpha < kappa}.

    # By induction, we find X_n = {alpha + n | alpha < kappa} for n >= 1.

    # Step 2: Characterize the intersection Y.
    # Y is the intersection of X_n for all n in omega (0, 1, 2, ...).
    # An ordinal `gamma` is in Y if:
    # a) `gamma` is in X_0, so `gamma < kappa`.
    # b) `gamma` is in X_n for all n >= 1. This means for each n, `gamma` can be written
    #    as `alpha_n + n`, which implies `gamma >= n`.
    # For `gamma` to be >= n for all n in {1, 2, 3, ...}, `gamma` must be greater than or
    # equal to the supremum of the natural numbers, which is omega.
    # So, Y = {gamma | omega <= gamma < kappa}.

    # Step 3: Determine the order type of Y.
    # Y is the interval of ordinals [omega, kappa). We want to find its order type, otp(Y).
    # We can define an order-preserving bijection f: kappa -> Y.
    # Let f(alpha) = omega + alpha.
    # - Is the map's output in Y? For alpha < kappa, we have omega <= omega + alpha.
    #   The cardinality |omega + alpha| = max(aleph_0, |alpha|) is less than kappa,
    #   so the ordinal omega + alpha is less than kappa. Yes.
    # - Is it a bijection? Yes, it's injective, and for any gamma in Y, there is a
    #   unique alpha < kappa such that omega + alpha = gamma.
    # Because there is an order-preserving bijection from kappa to Y, otp(Y) = kappa.

    # Step 4: Answer the question.
    # For how many ordinals `alpha` is otp(Y) >= alpha?
    # Since otp(Y) = kappa, we need the number of ordinals `alpha` with kappa >= alpha.
    # This set of ordinals is {alpha | alpha <= kappa}, which is just kappa + 1.
    # The number of such ordinals is the cardinality of this set, |kappa + 1|, which is kappa.

    print("The final answer is the cardinal kappa, based on the following reasoning:")
    print("\n--- Conceptual Equation ---")
    
    # The problem asks for the number of `alpha` where `otp(Y) >= alpha`.
    # This reasoning follows the steps above to find that number.
