    print("2. Cell Behavior (Adherence): Fibroblasts are anchorage-dependent cells, so they correctly 'adhered to the bottom of the flask'. This is essential for their survival and proliferation in vitro.")
    print("3. Cell Behavior (Differentiation): In culture conditions with serum, quiescent keratocytes differentiate into active fibroblasts and often further into 'myofibroblasts', which is a key part of wound healing and is expected in this setup.")
