    Calculates the number of intersection points in a hypothetical geometric system.

    In this system, a new parallel postulate is introduced:
    "Through any point not on a given line, there exist exactly three
    distinct lines parallel to the given line".

    The calculation proceeds as follows:
    1. Define the number of parallel lines from the new axiom.
    2. Identify the three groups of parallel lines to be drawn based on the triangle's
       sides and vertices.
    3. Calculate the pairwise intersections between these groups of lines.
    4. Sum these intersections to get the total number of new points.
