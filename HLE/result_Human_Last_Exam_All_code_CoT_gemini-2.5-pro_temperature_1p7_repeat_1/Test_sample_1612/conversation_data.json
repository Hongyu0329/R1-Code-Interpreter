    "To determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we need to count the instances for both batting and pitching. The batting Triple Crown is for leading the league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs. The pitching Triple Crown is for leading in wins, ERA, and strikeouts.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a list of all the players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n2.  Create a list of all the players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n3.  Write a Python script to count the number of winners in each list.\n4.  Sum these two counts to get the total number of Triple Crown achievements in MLB history.\n5.  Print the final equation showing the addition of batting and pitching winners.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crowns():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of MLB Triple Crown instances (batting and pitching).\n    The data includes winners from the modern era (post-1900).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for Batting Triple Crown winners\n    batting_winners = [\n        {\"player\": \"Nap Lajoie\", \"year\": 1901},\n        {\"player\": \"Ty Cobb\", \"year\": 1909},\n        {\"player\": \"Heinie Zimmerman\", \"year\": 1912},\n        {\"player\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"year\": 1922},\n        {\"player\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"year\": 1925},\n        {\"player\": \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"year\": 1933},\n        {\"player\": \"Chuck Klein\", \"year\": 1933},\n        {\"player\": \"Lou Gehrig\", \"year\": 1934},\n        {\"player\": \"Joe Medwick\", \"year\": 1937},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Williams\", \"year\": 1942},\n        {\"player\": \"Ted Williams\", \"year\": 1947},\n        {\"player\": \"Mickey Mantle\", \"year\": 1956},\n        {\"player\": \"Frank Robinson\", \"year\": 1966},\n        {\"player\": \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"year\": 1967},\n        {\"player\": \"Miguel Cabrera\", \"year\": 2012},\n    ]\n\n    # Data for Pitching Triple Crown winners\n    pitching_winners = [\n        {\"player\": \"Cy Young\", \"year\": 1901},\n        {\"player\": \"Rube Waddell\", \"year\": 1905},\n        {\"player\": \"Christy Mathewson\", \"year\": 1905},\n        {\"player\": \"Christy Mathewson\", \"year\": 1908},\n        {\"player\": \"Walter Johnson\", \"year\": 1913},\n        {\"player\": \"Pete Alexander\", \"year\": 1915},\n        {\"player\": \"Pete Alexander\", \"year\": 1916},\n        {\"player\": \"Walter Johnson\", \"year\": 1918},\n        {\"player\": \"Hippo Vaughn\", \"year\": 1918},\n        {\"player\": \"Pete Alexander\", \"year\": 1920},\n        {\"player\": \"Walter Johnson\", \"year\": 1924},\n        {\"player\": \"Dazzy Vance\", \"year\": 1924},\n        {\"player\": \"Lefty Grove\", \"year\": 1930},\n        {\"player\": \"Lefty Grove\", \"year\": 1931},\n        {\"player\": \"Lefty Gomez\", \"year\": 1934},\n        {\"player\": \"Lefty Gomez\", \"year\": 1937},\n        {\"player\": \"Bucky Walters\", \"year\": 1939},\n        {\"player\": \"Bob Feller\", \"year\": 1940},\n        {\"player\": \"Hal Newhouser\", \"year\": 1945},\n        {\"player\": \"Sandy Koufax\", \"year\": 1963},\n        {\"player\": \"Sandy Koufax\", \"year\": 1965},\n        {\"player\": \"Sandy Koufax\", \"year\": 1966},\n        {\"player\": \"Steve Carlton\", \"year\": 1972},\n        {\"player\": \"Dwight Gooden\", \"year\": 1985},\n        {\"player\": \"Roger Clemens\", \"year\": 1997},\n        {\"player\": \"Roger Clemens\", \"year\": 1998},\n        {\"player\": \"Pedro Martinez\", \"year\": 1999},\n        {\"player\": \"Randy Johnson\", \"year\": 2002},\n        {\"player\": \"Johan Santana\", \"year\": 2006},\n        {\"player\": \"Jake Peavy\", \"year\": 2007},\n        {\"player\": \"Justin Verlander\", \"year\": 2011},\n        {\"player\": \"Clayton Kershaw\", \"year\": 2011},\n        {\"player\": \"Shane Bieber\", \"year\": 2020},\n    ]\n\n    num_batting_crowns = len(batting_winners)\n    num_pitching_crowns = len(pitching_winners)\n    total_crowns = num_batting_crowns + num_pitching_crowns\n\n    print(f\"To find the total number of MLB Triple Crowns, we sum the batting and pitching instances.\")\n    print(f\"Total Triple Crowns = (Batting Triple Crowns) + (Pitching Triple Crowns)\")\n    print(f\"Total = {num_batting_crowns} + {num_pitching_crowns} = {total_crowns}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_mlb_triple_crowns()\n```\n<<<48>>>"
