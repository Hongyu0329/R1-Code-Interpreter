  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nLittle Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.\n\nInput\nEach of the first two lines contains a bought string. The strings' lengths range from 1 to 100 inclusive. It is guaranteed that the strings are of the same length and also consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\nIf the first string is less than the second one, print \"-1\". If the second string is less than the first one, print \"1\". If the strings are equal, print \"0\".

    "Of course! I can help with that. The task is to analyze the memory efficiency of a C program for a string comparison problem and to present the solution within a Python script as per the instructions.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will analyze the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C implementation. The problem requires comparing two strings of up to 100 characters lexicographically, ignoring case. A memory-efficient approach would avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously. Instead, it would store the first string and then read the second string character by character, performing the comparison on the fly.\n2.  Next, I will calculate the memory required for the variables in this optimized C program. This involves considering the data types needed for storing the first string, a loop counter, and the character being read from the second string.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script that performs and explains this calculation, as requested. The script will print the breakdown of the memory calculation.\n\nHere is the Python script that calculates the memory usage:\n```python\ndef calculate_memory_usage():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the memory usage in bytes for the variables\n    of the most memory-efficient C program to solve the described problem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Memory for the first string's buffer.\n    # The maximum string length is 100. In C, a null terminator ('\\0') is\n    # needed, so the buffer size must be 101. sizeof(char) is 1 byte.\n    # Equation: 101 characters * 1 byte/character\n    string_buffer_memory = 101 * 1\n\n    # Memory for the loop index.\n    # The loop runs from 0 to a maximum of 99. An 'unsigned char' in C,\n    # which is 1 byte, can store values from 0 to 255 and is sufficient.\n    # Equation: 1 variable * 1 byte/variable\n    index_variable_memory = 1\n\n    # Memory for the variable holding a character from the second string.\n    # The C function getchar() is used for reading character by character.\n    # It returns an 'int' to accommodate the special EOF (End-Of-File) value.\n    # On typical competitive programming platforms, sizeof(int) is 4 bytes.\n    # Equation: 1 variable * 4 bytes/variable\n    char_variable_memory = 4\n\n    # Calculate the total memory usage 'm' by summing the bytes for each variable.\n    m = string_buffer_memory + index_variable_memory + char_variable_memory\n\n    print(\"The most memory-efficient C program would store the first string, then read the second string character by character.\")\n    print(\"The total memory 'm' in bytes used for its variables is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"m = (memory for string buffer) + (memory for loop index) + (memory for input character)\")\n    print(f\"m = {string_buffer_memory} + {index_variable_memory} + {char_variable_memory}\")\n    print(f\"m = {m}\")\n\n# Run the calculation and print the result.\ncalculate_memory_usage()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
