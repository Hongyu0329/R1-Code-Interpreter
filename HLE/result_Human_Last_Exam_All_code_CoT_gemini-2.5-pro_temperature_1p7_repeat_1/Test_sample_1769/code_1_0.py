# 1. The current English word "sister" comes from the Old Norse word "systir".
#    The Norse language heavily influenced English during the Viking invasions.
print("The modern English word 'sister' is an import from the Old Norse language of the Vikings.")

# 2. If the Norse had never interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the native Old English word would have continued its evolution.
#    The Old English word for sister was "sweoster".
print("The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was 'sweoster'.")

# 3. This word is related to German "Schwester" and Dutch "zuster".
#    Following standard English linguistic development, "sweoster" would have likely simplified.
#    In Middle English, it was commonly written as "suster".
print("Without Norse influence, 'sweoster' would have naturally evolved, likely becoming 'suster' in Middle English.")

# 4. As Middle English evolved into Modern English, the vowel sound in "suster" would have changed
#    from a sound like 'oo' in 'book' to the 'u' sound in "cup".
#    Therefore, the final word would likely be spelled and pronounced as "suster".
