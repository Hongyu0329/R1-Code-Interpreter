# But the question asks for "the chemical concentration", plural. So I will display both in the python output.
# I will output the final PFOS value in the answer tag. It's arbitrary which one to choose.

# Let's check the request "directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response"
# The question is "what are the chemical concentration accumulated". It asks for two values. I can list them.
# The calculation provides "1155.61" and "2318769.94".
# I'll just provide the two final numbers as the answer.
