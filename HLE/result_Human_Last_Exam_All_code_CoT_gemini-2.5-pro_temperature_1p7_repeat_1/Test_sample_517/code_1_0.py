def calculate_limit():
    """
    This function explains the calculation for the limit of p_n.
    As derived in the explanation, the problem simplifies dramatically.

    Let p_n be the probability that the conditioned walk hits the target set A_n.
    The formula for this hitting probability is:
    p_n = E_{(0,1)}[ a(X_{T_{A_n}}) / a((0,1)) * I(T_{A_n} < T_0) ]
    where a(x) is the potential kernel.

    This can be approximated as:
    p_n approx ( P_{(0,1)}(T_{A_n} < T_0) / a((0,1)) ) * a((n,0))

    The probability for the standard random walk P_{(0,1)}(T_{A_n} < T_0) can
    itself be approximated by the harmonic function v(x) = a(x) / a((n,0)).
    So, P_{(0,1)}(T_{A_n} < T_0) approx a((0,1)) / a((n,0)).

    Substituting this back gives:
    p_n approx ( (a((0,1)) / a((n,0))) / a((0,1)) ) * a((n,0))
    p_n approx ( 1 / a((n,0)) ) * a((n,0)) = 1

    The limit as n approaches infinity is 1.
