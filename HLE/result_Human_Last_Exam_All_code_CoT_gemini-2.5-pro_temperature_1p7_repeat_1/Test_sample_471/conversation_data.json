    "This problem can be solved using concepts from Morse theory, which relates the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the manifold's topological properties.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will use a fundamental result from Morse theory which provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of a smooth function on a compact manifold.\n2.  This result states that the number of critical points must be at least the sum of the manifold's Betti numbers. Betti numbers are topological invariants that count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions in a space.\n3.  I will identify the Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$):\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of one-dimensional \"circular\" holes.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of two-dimensional \"voids\" or \"cavities\".\n4.  I will write a Python script to sum these Betti numbers. This sum gives the minimal possible number of critical points. This bound is achievable, as there exist functions on the torus (so-called \"perfect\" Morse functions) that have exactly this many critical points.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using its Betti numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2) are well-known topological invariants.\n    # b_0 is the number of connected components.
