    "My plan is to use Bresenham's line algorithm to determine all the integer coordinates (pixels) that lie on the line from (1, 1) to (11, 5). Since the change in x (dx = 10) is greater than the change in y (dy = 4), the algorithm will iterate along the x-axis and decide at each step whether to increment the y-coordinate. After generating the complete list of pixels, I will find the central pixel by selecting the element at the middle index of the list.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    # A list to store all the pixels on the line\n    points = []\n\n    # Calculate deltas and initial decision parameter\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    \n    # This is a simplified version of Bresenham's for the first octant (0 <= m <= 1)\n    # where m is the slope. Our slope is 4/10 = 0.4, which fits this case.\n    decision_parameter = 2 * dy - dx\n    \n    x, y = x1, y1\n\n    # Iterate from the start to the end point along the major axis (x)\n    while x <= x2:\n        points.append((x, y))\n        \n        # Move to the next pixel\n        x += 1\n        \n        # Update decision parameter to choose the next y-coordinate\n        if decision_parameter < 0:\n            # Keep y the same\n            decision_parameter += (2 * dy)\n        else:\n            # Increment y\n            y += 1\n            decision_parameter += (2 * dy) - (2 * dx)\n\n    # The line has been generated. Now, find the central pixel.\n    # With an odd number of points, the middle index is easy to find.\n    central_index = len(points) // 2\n    central_pixel = points[central_index]\n    \n    print(f\"The line from ({x1},{y1}) to ({x2},{y2}) passes through {len(points)} pixels.\")\n    # The prompt asks to output the numbers in the final equation. \n    # Since the final output is a coordinate, not an equation, I will just print the coordinate.\n    print(f\"The central pixel has coordinates: ({central_pixel[0]}, {central_pixel[1]})\")\n\nfind_central_pixel()\n```\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
