    The problem considers the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in a 2-dimensional torus (T^2):
        
        Equation: ∂_t u + u·∇u = Δu - ∇p
        Incompressibility condition: ∇·u = 0
        Initial condition: u(x, 0) = u_0(x)

    The question is: Is there a smooth, divergence-free, and periodic initial data u_0
    such that the solution u blows up in finite time?

    The definitive answer to this question is No.

    This is a cornerstone result in the mathematical theory of fluid dynamics. For the
    2D Navier-Stokes equations with smooth, divergence-free initial data on a periodic
    domain, it has been rigorously proven that a unique, smooth solution exists for all
    time t > 0. This property is known as "global regularity".

    The mathematical proof relies on establishing what are called 'a priori estimates'.
    A key insight is to analyze the evolution of the vorticity, ω = curl(u). In 2D,
    the vorticity is a scalar field, and its evolution equation is given by:
        
        ∂_t ω + u·∇ω = Δω

    Critically, the 2D structure ensures that the "vortex stretching" term, which
    causes significant difficulties in 3D, is absent. From this equation, one can
    prove that the L^2 norm of the vorticity, ||ω(t)||_2, does not increase in time.
    This fundamental global bound on vorticity is sufficient to control the nonlinear
    term u·∇u and prove that all higher-order derivatives of the solution u also
    remain bounded for all time. This guarantees that the solution remains smooth
    indefinitely, thus preventing any finite-time blow-up.

    In sharp contrast, the same question for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations remains
    one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, known as the
    "Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness" problem, and is a Millennium Prize Problem.
