        f"3. During replication, the {repeat_sequence} repeats can form secondary hairpin structures, which can lead to the synthesis of extra repeats.",
        f"4. The enzyme {gene_of_interest} is crucial for joining DNA strands, particularly for sealing the nicks between Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.",
        f"5. This ligation step by LIG1 is essential to 'lock in' the newly expanded repeat tract, making the expansion permanent.",
        f"6. Scientific studies have shown that when LIG1 function is reduced (through knockdown or inhibition), this final sealing step is compromised.",
        "7. As a result, the expanded repeats are not permanently integrated into the genome. This suppresses the rate of repeat expansion.",
