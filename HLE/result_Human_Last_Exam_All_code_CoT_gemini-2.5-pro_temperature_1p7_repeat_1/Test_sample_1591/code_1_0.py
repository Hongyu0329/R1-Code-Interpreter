# Step 1-4: As outlined in the plan, the problem boils down to calculating
# (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.

# Step 5: Use boundary conditions to find the components of x_0.

# From x_{2025}^2 = 10^20 and the system's 3-periodicity (2025 is a multiple of 3),
# we have x_0^2 = 10^20.
x0_2 = 1e20

# From the boundary condition on x_1:
# -2/3*x_1^1 - 2/sqrt(3)*x_1^2 + sqrt(3)/(2*pi) = 0
# Substituting x_1 = A*x_0 + b and simplifying leads to the relation:
# -2/3*x_0^1 + 2/sqrt(3)*x_0^2 + (sqrt(3)/(2*pi))*(1-r) = 0
# For this equation to yield a specific numerical result independent of the
# unknown parameter r, the term with r must vanish. This happens if r=1.
# Assuming r=1, the equation becomes:
# -2/3*x_0^1 + 2/sqrt(3)*x_0^2 = 0
# This simplifies to x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2.

x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 6: Calculate the final value (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
x0_1_squared = x0_1**2
x0_2_squared = x0_2**2
result = x0_1_squared + x0_2_squared

# Step 7: Print the final equation with the computed numbers.
# The format "{:.1e}" will represent numbers in scientific notation.

print(f"x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * 10^20")

print(f"({x0_1:.2e})^2 + ({x0_2:.2e})^2 = {x0_1_squared:.1e} + {x0_2_squared:.1e} = {result:.1e}")

# The final answer is the result of the calculation.
print("\nFinal numerical answer:")
