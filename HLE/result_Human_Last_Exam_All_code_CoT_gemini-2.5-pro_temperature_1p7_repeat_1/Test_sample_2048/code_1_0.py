# Step 1: Determine the value of p_k(1)
# Based on the analysis, the probability density function f(v) is zero for all v.
# This implies the resulting probability density function for z, p_k(z), is also zero everywhere.
p_k_at_1 = 0

# Step 2: Determine the value of d_k
# The differential entropy d_k is given by the integral of -p_k(z) * log(p_k(z)).
# Since p_k(z) is 0, we rely on the limit lim_{x->0} x*log(x) = 0.
# Thus, the integral is 0, and the entropy d_k is 0.
d_k = 0

# Step 3: Define the constant term in the expression for l(k)
constant_term = -1

# Step 4: Calculate l(k) using the formula l(k) = p_k(1) + 2*d_k - 1
l_k = p_k_at_1 + 2 * d_k + constant_term

# Final output stage as requested
