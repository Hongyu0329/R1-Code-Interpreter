    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of irreducible representations and the total number of indecomposable representations for the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. In this context, $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ refers to the restricted or 'small' quantum group, as it possesses a finite number of indecomposable representations.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Let $\\ell = 3$, since $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. The classification of indecomposable modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is well-known and depends on $\\ell$.\n2.  Count the number of non-isomorphic **irreducible** (or simple) modules. According to the theory, there are $\\ell$ such modules.\n3.  Count the number of non-isomorphic **reducible indecomposable** modules. These are further divided into two types:\n    *   Projective indecomposable modules.\n    *   A family of non-projective, periodic modules.\n    We will count the number of modules in each of these families for $\\ell=3$.\n4.  Sum these counts to find the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules, which are the objects of the category $C$.\n5.  Finally, calculate the percentage of irreducible modules by dividing their count by the total count of indecomposable modules and multiplying by 100.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, showing the counts for each type of module and the final percentage calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_representation_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of irreducible representations among all\n    indecomposable representations for u_q(sl_2) where q is a primitive\n    third root of unity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let l be the order of the root of unity.\n    # q is a primitive third root of unity, so l = 3.\n    l = 3\n\n    # Step 1: Count the number of irreducible modules.\n    # For a primitive l-th root of unity, there are 'l' non-isomorphic\n    # simple (irreducible) modules. Let's call this N_irr.\n    num_irreducible = l\n\n    # Step 2: Count the number of reducible indecomposable modules.\n    # These fall into two main categories for the small quantum group u_q(sl_2).\n    #\n    # a) Projective indecomposable modules:\n    #    There are (l-1) non-isomorphic projective indecomposable modules\n    #    which are the projective covers of the non-projective simple modules.\n    num_projective_indecomposable = l - 1\n    #\n    # b) Periodic modules (sometimes called tadpole modules):\n    #    These form l-1 \"tubes\" in the Auslander-Reiten quiver.\n    #    For the standard classification, there are 2 * (l-1) such modules.\n    num_periodic_indecomposable = 2 * (l - 1)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of indecomposable modules.\n    # This is the sum of irreducible and reducible indecomposable modules.\n    total_indecomposable_modules = num_irreducible + num_projective_indecomposable + num_periodic_indecomposable\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the percentage.\n    percentage = (num_irreducible / total_indecomposable_modules) * 100\n\n    # Print the detailed breakdown of the calculation.\n    print(f\"Analysis for u_q(sl_2) with q being a primitive {l}rd root of unity (l=3):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Counting the irreducible modules (objects in C).\")\n    print(f\"The number of non-isomorphic irreducible modules is l = {num_irreducible}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Counting all indecomposable modules (objects in C).\")\n    print(\"The non-isomorphic indecomposable modules are composed of:\")\n    print(f\"  - Irreducible modules: {num_irreducible}\")\n    print(f\"  - Projective indecomposable (reducible) modules: l-1 = {num_projective_indecomposable}\")\n    print(f\"  - Periodic indecomposable (reducible) modules: 2*(l-1) = {num_periodic_indecomposable}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the total number of indecomposable modules is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Modules = (Number of Irreducibles) + (Number of Projectives) + (Number of Periodics)\")\n    print(f\"Total Modules = {num_irreducible} + {num_projective_indecomposable} + {num_periodic_indecomposable} = {total_indecomposable_modules}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculating the final percentage.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the percentage of irreducible modules is:\")\n    print(f\"Percentage = (Number of Irreducible Modules / Total Number of Indecomposable Modules) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage = ({num_irreducible} / {total_indecomposable_modules}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Result: {percentage:.2f}%\")\n\n\nsolve_representation_percentage()\n```\n<<<33.33>>>"
