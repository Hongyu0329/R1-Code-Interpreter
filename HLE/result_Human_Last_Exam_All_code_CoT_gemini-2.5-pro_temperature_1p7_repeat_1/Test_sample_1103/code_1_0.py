    Solves the Gauss class number problem for h = 48.

    This problem asks for the number of negative fundamental discriminants 'd'
    such that the class number h(d) of the imaginary quadratic field Q(sqrt(d)) is 48.

    This is a computationally hard problem. The solution relies on pre-computed results
    from mathematical research in number theory. According to the comprehensive tables
    compiled by mathematicians like Mark Watkins, this number has been determined.
