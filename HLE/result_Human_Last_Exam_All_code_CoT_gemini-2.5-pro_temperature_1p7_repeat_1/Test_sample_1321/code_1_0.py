    # Q3: Is a(n)=inf for large n in 5D? No, conjectured to be finite.
    # Q4: Is a(n)=inf for large n in 6D? No, conjectured to be finite.
    # Q5: Is a(n) < K*n for d>=1? No, conjectured to be O(n^2) for d>=2.
    # Q6: Is a(n) >= 9n-8 in 3D? Yes, based on known constructions (pagoda sequence). 9 = 2^3+1.
    # Q7: Is a(n) >= 17n-16 in 4D? Yes, by analogy. 17 = 2^4+1.
    # Q8: Is a(n) < 33n-32 in 5D? No, we expect a(n) >= 33n-32. 33 = 2^5+1.
    # Q9: Is a(n) >= (2^d+1)(n-1)+1 for d>=2? Yes, this seems to be the underlying formula for the specific constructions.
