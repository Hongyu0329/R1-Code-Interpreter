    Problem Analysis:
    The core challenge is to balance several conflicting requirements for a pseudo-resistor at a low supply voltage of {supply_voltage}V:
    1. Subthreshold Operation: Maintain a stable high resistance.
    2. Offset Tolerance: Handle sensor offsets of +/- {sensor_offset*1000}mV.
    3. Rapid Reset: Settle in less than {reset_time_limit*1e6} microseconds.
    4. Low Leakage: Ensure gate voltage leakage is below {leakage_limit*100}% per second.

    Evaluation of Option E:
    Option E, the 'split-gate' transistor, provides the most effective balance. Here's why:

    - Offset and Headroom Handling: The bootstrapped half of the gate allows the gate voltage to track the source voltage. This maintains a relatively constant gate-to-source voltage (Vgs), keeping the transistor in the desired subthreshold region even when the input signal and its DC offset of +/- {sensor_offset*1000}mV cause the source voltage to fluctuate. This is the critical feature for handling the signal swing and offset.

    - Leakage and Stability: The statically driven half of the gate provides a stable DC bias. While the bootstrapped capacitor still leaks, its declining voltage is averaged with the fixed voltage of the static half. This makes the transistor's overall conduction far less sensitive to the leakage, effectively mitigating the problem without the switching noise that Option B would introduce. This static portion can also be used to trim out device mismatches.

    - Rapid Reset: The strategy defines a clear reset mechanism (e.g., grounding both gate halves of a PMOS transistor) to drive the device into strong inversion, creating a low-resistance path for fast settling, thus meeting the <{reset_time_limit*1e6}Âµs requirement.

    Why other options are inferior:
    - A: Fails on leakage control and stability.
    - B: Introduces new problems (switching noise and complexity).
    - C: Risky at low voltage, likely failing on either headroom or signal swing.
    - D: Fails the fundamental requirement of handling DC offset by removing the bootstrapping effect.

    Conclusion:
    Option E is the superior engineering solution because it intelligently separates the DC and AC biasing functions of the gate to address all the design constraints simultaneously.
