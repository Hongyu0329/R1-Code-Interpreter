# The problem simplifies to the calculation of the expression:
# (3/2) * 10^(10/3) + 37/4

# Define the components of the final simplified equation
a = 3/2
b = 10
c = 10/3
d = 37/4

# Calculate the final result
result = a * (b**c) + d

# Print the components of the final equation as requested
print("The final simplified equation is: a * b**c + d")
print(f"Each number in the final equation is:")
print(f"a = {a}")
print(f"b = {b}")
print(f"c = {c:.4f} (which is 10/3)")
print(f"d = {d}")
print("-" * 30)

# Print the final numerical result
print(f"The final calculated value is: {result}")
