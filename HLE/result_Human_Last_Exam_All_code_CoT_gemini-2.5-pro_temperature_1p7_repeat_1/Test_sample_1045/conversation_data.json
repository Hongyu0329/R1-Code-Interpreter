    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms and their counts:** Toluene has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted basis functions per atom type for the 6-31G basis set.**\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 6-31G basis set describes the 1s valence orbital with two contracted functions (a \"split-valence\" representation: `31G`). So, each H atom has **2** contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is represented by **1** contracted function (the `6` in 6-31G).\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are each split into two parts (the `31` in 6-31G).\n            *   The inner valence shell consists of one s-function and three p-functions (px, py, pz), for a total of **4** contracted functions.\n            *   The outer valence shell also consists of one s-function and three p-functions, for another **4** contracted functions.\n        *   Therefore, each Carbon atom has a total of 1 + 4 + 4 = **9** contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total for the molecule:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the final result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 (core 1s) + 4 (inner valence 2s, 2p) + 4 (outer valence 2s, 2p) = 9\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): The 1s orbital is split into two functions.\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions\ntotal_funcs_carbon = num_carbon * funcs_per_carbon\ntotal_funcs_hydrogen = num_hydrogen * funcs_per_hydrogen\ntotal_functions = total_funcs_carbon + total_funcs_hydrogen\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8):\")\nprint(f\"Each of the {num_carbon} Carbon atoms uses {funcs_per_carbon} contracted Gaussian functions.\")\nprint(f\"Each of the {num_hydrogen} Hydrogen atoms uses {funcs_per_hydrogen} contracted Gaussian functions.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of contracted functions is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon} C atoms * {funcs_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen} H atoms * {funcs_per_hydrogen} functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"= {num_carbon} * {funcs_per_carbon} + {num_hydrogen} * {funcs_per_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
