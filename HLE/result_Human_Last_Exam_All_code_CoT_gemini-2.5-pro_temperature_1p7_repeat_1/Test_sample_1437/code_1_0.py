    Calculates the static, long-wavelength limit of the dimensionless Lindhard function.

    The Lindhard polarization function Π(k, 0) at T=0 is given by:
    Π(k, 0) = -D(ε_F) * F(x)
    where:
    - D(ε_F) is the density of states per unit volume at the Fermi level.
    - x = k / (2*k_F), with k_F being the Fermi wavevector.
    - F(x) = 1/2 + [ (1 - x**2) / (4*x) ] * ln[ |(1+x) / (1-x)| ]

    The problem asks for Π(k=0, 0). This is equivalent to taking the limit as k -> 0, which means x -> 0.
    The direct value is Π(0, 0) = -D(ε_F), which is not a universal number.

    Instead, we evaluate the dimensionless ratio Π(k, 0) / D(ε_F), which in the limit k -> 0 gives a universal numerical value.
    This is equivalent to calculating -lim_{x->0} F(x).
