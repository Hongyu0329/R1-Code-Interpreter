    # --- Derivation Steps ---

    # Step 1: Solve for Electric Field E(r)
    # The governing equation is div(sigma * grad(Phi)) = 0. For sigma(r) ~ r^2,
    # this simplifies to d/dr(r^3 * d(Phi)/dr) = 0.
    # The solution for the E-field is of the form E_r = K / r**3.
    # The constant K is found by integrating E_r from a to b, which must equal V.
    # V = integral(E_r dr) from a to b => V = K * (1/a**2 - 1/b**2) / 2
    K = (2 * V * a**2 * b**2) / (b**2 - a**2)
    E_r = K / r**3

    # Step 2: Calculate Total Volume Charge q_v
    # rho_v = epsilon * div(E)
    # In cylindrical coordinates, div(E) = (1/r) * d(r*E_r)/dr
    div_E = sympy.diff(r * E_r, r) / r
    rho_v = epsilon * div_E
    # q_v = integral(rho_v * d(Volume)) from a to b
    # The integral simplifies to:
    q_v = -4 * pi * L * epsilon * V

    # Step 3: Calculate Total Surface Charges q_s(a) and q_s(b)
    # q_s(a) = Area(a) * D_n(a) = (2*pi*a*L) * (epsilon * E_r(r=a))
    E_r_at_a = E_r.subs(r, a)
    q_s_a = sympy.simplify((2 * pi * a * L) * (epsilon * E_r_at_a))

    # q_s(b) = Area(b) * D_n(b) = (2*pi*b*L) * (-epsilon * E_r(r=b))
    E_r_at_b = E_r.subs(r, b)
    q_s_b = sympy.simplify((2 * pi * b * L) * (-epsilon * E_r_at_b))

    print("-" * 70)

    # --- Analysis of Options ---
    # The derived set of charges conserves charge (sums to zero).
    # Now we compare with the provided choices. Option B is:
    # q_v_B = (-4*pi*L*epsilon*V) / (1 - a**2/b**2)
    # q_s_a_B = (2*pi*L*epsilon*V) / (1 - a**2/b**2)
    # q_s_b_B = (-4*pi*L*epsilon*V * a**2) / (b**2 * (1 - a**2/b**2))
    # We can see that q_s_b matches perfectly.
    # q_s_a is off by a factor of 2.
    # q_v differs by a factor of 1/(1 - a^2/b^2).
    # The charges in Option B do not sum to zero.
    #
    # Despite the errors, Option B is the only choice with a correctly calculated term
    # and is the most likely intended answer in a multiple-choice context where
    # the question itself may be flawed.
