    # The number to be represented is 10^100. Python's int can handle this size.

    # The number of terms in the summation corresponds to the number of set bits (1s)
    # in the binary representation of N. This is also known as the population count.

    term_count = bin(N).count('1')

    # The largest term in the sequence corresponds to the largest power of 2
    # in the binary expansion of N. The exponent of this power of 2, k_max,
    # is determined by the most significant bit of N.

    # index of the most significant bit (0-indexed) is N.bit_length() - 1.

    # Now, we need to decompose k_max to find a1 and b1 using the formula:
    # k_max = 2^(a1 - 1) + b1, with the constraint b1 < 2^(a1 - 1).
    
    # 'p' will be a1 - 1. It is the floor of log2(k_max).
