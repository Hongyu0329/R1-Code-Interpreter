# The biological question asks to identify a protein whose breakdown facilitates macrophage engulfment of amyloid plaques.
# This process is a key function of the innate immune system in the brain, particularly involving microglia (the brain's resident macrophages) and the complement system.

# The protein is Complement component 3, or C3.
# Here is the process:
# 1. The complement system is activated in the presence of amyloid plaques.
# 2. Complement component 3 (C3) is cleaved by an enzyme (a C3-convertase) into two fragments: C3a and C3b.
# 3. The C3b fragment covalently attaches to the surface of the amyloid plaques, effectively "tagging" them for disposal. This tagging process is called opsonization.
# 4. Microglia have complement receptors (like CR3) on their surface that recognize and bind to the C3b fragment.
# 5. This binding triggers the microglia to engulf (phagocytose) the C3b-coated amyloid plaque.

# Therefore, it is the breakdown of C3 that generates the C3b fragment, which in turn "allows" for macrophage engulfment.
