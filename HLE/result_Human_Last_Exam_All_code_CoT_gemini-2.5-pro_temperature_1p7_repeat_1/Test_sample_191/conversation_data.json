    "My plan is to first identify the key biological process the user is asking about. The question is about a protein that, upon being broken down, enables macrophages to engulf amyloid deposits. This points to an immune system pathway in the brain called the complement system, which is involved in \"tagging\" debris for removal. I will identify the central protein in this pathway that fits the description.\n\nSpecifically, the process involves:\n1.  Identifying the material to be cleared (amyloid plaques).\n2.  A protein from the complement system binds to or is activated near the amyloid.\n3.  This protein is cleaved (broken down) into active fragments.\n4.  One of these fragments, C3b, coats the amyloid surface in a process called opsonization.\n5.  Macrophages (specifically microglia in the brain) have receptors for C3b, allowing them to recognize and engulf the tagged amyloid.\n\nTherefore, the protein that is broken down to allow this process is Complement component 3 (C3). I will create a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\n# The biological question asks to identify a protein whose breakdown facilitates macrophage engulfment of amyloid plaques.\n# This process is a key function of the innate immune system in the brain, particularly involving microglia (the brain's resident macrophages) and the complement system.\n\n# The protein is Complement component 3, or C3.\n# Here is the process:\n# 1. The complement system is activated in the presence of amyloid plaques.\n# 2. Complement component 3 (C3) is cleaved by an enzyme (a C3-convertase) into two fragments: C3a and C3b.\n# 3. The C3b fragment covalently attaches to the surface of the amyloid plaques, effectively \"tagging\" them for disposal. This tagging process is called opsonization.\n# 4. Microglia have complement receptors (like CR3) on their surface that recognize and bind to the C3b fragment.\n# 5. This binding triggers the microglia to engulf (phagocytose) the C3b-coated amyloid plaque.\n\n# Therefore, it is the breakdown of C3 that generates the C3b fragment, which in turn \"allows\" for macrophage engulfment.\n\nprotein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\nprint(protein_name)\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
