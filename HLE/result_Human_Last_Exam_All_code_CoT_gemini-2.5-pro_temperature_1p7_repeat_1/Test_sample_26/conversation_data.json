    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use the properties of a Lefschetz pencil.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface. A generic pencil of hyperplane sections defines a surjective map $p: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^1$.\n2.  This map is not a fiber bundle over all of $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ because it has a finite number of singular fibers. However, if we remove these singular points from the base $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ (let's call the resulting space $B'$) and their corresponding fibers from $X$ (let's call the resulting space $X'$), we get a locally trivial fibration $p: X' \\to B'$.\n3.  The fiber of this fibration, let's call it $f$, is a generic hyperplane section of $X$. Since $X$ is a quintic (degree 5), $f$ is a smooth plane quintic curve.\n4.  We can analyze the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this fibration to relate the homotopy groups of the fiber $f$, the base $B'$, and the total space $X'$.\n5.  We'll find that $\\pi_3(X') \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Then, we argue that the process of adding back the singular fibers to get from $X'$ to $X$ does not affect the third homotopy group.\n6.  Finally, we determine the rank of the resulting group.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes these steps and calculates the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rank_pi3_of_quintic_surface():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic\n    hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \n    This is a theoretical problem from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.\n    The code serves to explain the steps and compute the result based on established theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the object and the geometric setup (Lefschetz Pencil)\n    # X is a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.
