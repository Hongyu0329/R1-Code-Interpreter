    # We check the convergence of the integral of this function.
    
    # The integral of the term 1/(3u) is (1/3)*ln(u).
    # The integral of the term m/(u*ln(u)) is m*ln(ln(u)).
    # Both terms diverge as u approaches infinity.
    # Therefore, the mean service time E[S] is infinite.
    
    # Step 3: Conclude the long-term behavior of the number of customers, X_t.
    # For an M/G/infinity queue, if E[S] is infinite, the number of customers
    # in the system X_t tends to infinity almost surely.
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the liminf of X_t.
    # The fact that X_t tends to infinity means that for any constant K,
    # X_t will eventually exceed K and never drop below it.
    # This is the definition of the limit inferior being infinity.
