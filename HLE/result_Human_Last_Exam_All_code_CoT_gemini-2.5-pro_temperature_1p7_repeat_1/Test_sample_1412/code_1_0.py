# The reasoning process above leads to the conclusion that there is only one
# non-isomorphic graph that satisfies all the given conditions.
# This graph is the prism graph over a 1000-cycle, which is a specific
# instance of a generalized Petersen graph, GP(1000, 1).

# The problem is a logical deduction problem, not a computational one.
# The number of such non-isomorphic graphs is 1.
