    This function encapsulates the reasoning for each case and prints the final answer string.

    A) Depends on the graph H. If H=K1 (Y), if H=P2 (N). So, D.
    B) Any finite non-empty subset of R has a maximum. So, Y.
    C) The set N is countable, discrete but has no max. The set {1/n} has a max. So, D.
    D) Uncountable discrete subsets of R don't exist, so the statement is vacuously true. So, Y.
    E) The relation is `b` is a subsequence of `a`. Constant sequences are maximal. So, Y.
    F) The relation is `a` is a subsequence of `b`. No sequence is maximal. So, N.

    The final concatenated result is DYDYYN.
