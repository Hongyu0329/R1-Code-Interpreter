# The reciprocal concept to logical "depth" associated with Charles Bennett is "complexity".
word1 = "complexity"

# Step 2: Find c2
# The missing word in Murray Gell-Mann's quote "the two _ didn't commute" is "options".
word2 = "options"
c2 = word2[2]  # 3rd character, which is at index 2

# Step 3: Find c3 and c4

c3 = 'l'
# We Rot13 the letter 'l' to get c4.

# Mars is closer in mass to the Moon than to the Earth.

# Step 5: Concatenate and print the result
# The final result is the concatenation of c1, c2, c4, and c5 in lowercase.
# Final Equation: c1 + c2 + c4 + c5
