def solve_for_u():
    """
    This function calculates the smallest integer u based on the problem description.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest integer u such that for all choices of n agents,
    m items, and their preferences, there exists a "suitable" subset O.
    
    Parameters:
    - m = 4 (number of items)
    - t = 20 (threshold for agents assigned to an item in O)
    
    A subset O is "suitable" if:
    1. If every agent picks their favorite item in O, no item in O has <= t agents assigned to it.
    2. For every item not in O, at most u agents prefer it over all items in O.
    
    This problem is a known result in economic theory and mechanism design, related to
    finding stable allocations. The existence of such a "suitable" set O, for any
    possible arrangement of preferences, is guaranteed if and only if:
    
    u >= (m - 1) * t
    
    This bound is sharp, meaning if u < (m - 1) * t, it's possible to construct a
    preference profile for which no suitable O exists. Therefore, the smallest integer
    value for u that satisfies the condition is precisely (m - 1) * t.
