    This function analyzes the geometric constraints of the problem to find the
    number of spheres, n.

    The problem requires the cone's height H and radius R to be integers.
    This implies t = tan(alpha/2) must be rational, where alpha is the cone's
    semi-vertical angle.

    The core relationship derived is:
    ( (t+1)/(t-1) )**2 = 8 * (1-c) / (2c-1)**2
    where c = cos(2*pi/n).

    For t to be rational, the right-hand side must be a perfect square of a
    rational number. This requires c to be rational, which only happens for
    n = 3, 4, 6.
