    """
    Describes the daily transformation of a functionally accurate azobenzene table.
    Azobenzene photoisomerizes, meaning it changes its shape in response to light.
    - The 'trans' isomer is stable, relatively flat, and elongated.
    - The 'cis' isomer is less stable and has a bent, V-shape.
    - UV light (from the sun) converts 'trans' to 'cis'.
    - Visible light or heat (or darkness) allows 'cis' to relax back to 'trans'.
