    This function calculates and prints the smallest number of edges 'e' for a simple,
    connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.

    Our reasoning shows:
    1. The number of edges 'e' must be a multiple of 3, based on edge orbit sizes.
    2. e=3 and e=6 are ruled out as they lead to graphs with larger automorphism groups (typically size 6).
    3. The next multiple, e=9, is the smallest possible value. This would be formed from
       three edge orbits of size 3.
