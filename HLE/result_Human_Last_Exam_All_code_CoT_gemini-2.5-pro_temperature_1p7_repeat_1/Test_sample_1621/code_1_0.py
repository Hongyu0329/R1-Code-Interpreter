    This program determines for how many natural numbers n the described matrix property holds.

    The problem can be rephrased as finding the number of dimensions 'n' for which there exists
    an n-dimensional subspace of n x n real matrices where every non-zero matrix is invertible.

    A deep result in mathematics, related to the existence of real division algebras and solved
    using algebraic topology, shows that this is only possible for n = 1, 2, 4, and 8.

    - n=1 corresponds to the Real Numbers.
    - n=2 corresponds to the Complex Numbers.
    - n=4 corresponds to the Quaternions.
    - n=8 corresponds to the Octonions.

    These are the only possible values for n.
