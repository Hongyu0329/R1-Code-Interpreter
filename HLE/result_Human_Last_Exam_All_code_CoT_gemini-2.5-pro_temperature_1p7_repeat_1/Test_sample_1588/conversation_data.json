    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of independent Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables, X and Y. These form the basis for the terms of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. The number of such basis elements is given by Witt's formula.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Witt's Formula:** The formula for the dimension of the `n`-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on `k` generators is:\n    `d(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the order of the coefficients (degree of the polynomial), which is 10.\n    *   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (for `X` and `Y`).\n    *   The sum `Σ` is over all positive integers `d` that divide `n`.\n    *   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Möbius Function `μ(d)`:**\n    *   `μ(d) = 1` if `d` is a square-free integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    *   `μ(d) = -1` if `d` is a square-free integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    *   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n\n3.  **Calculation Steps for n=10:**\n    *   The divisors `d` of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n    *   We calculate the value of the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor:\n        *   `μ(1) = 1`\n        *   `μ(2) = -1` (one prime factor: 2)\n        *   `μ(5) = -1` (one prime factor: 5)\n        *   `μ(10) = μ(2*5) = 1` (two prime factors: 2, 5)\n    *   Now, we substitute these values into Witt's formula:\n        `d(10) = (1/10) * [μ(1)*2^(10/1) + μ(2)*2^(10/2) + μ(5)*2^(10/5) + μ(10)*2^(10/10)]`\n    *   Plugging in the numbers:\n        `d(10) = (1/10) * [1*(2^10) - 1*(2^5) - 1*(2^2) + 1*(2^1)]`\n        `d(10) = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]`\n        `d(10) = (1/10) * [990]`\n        `d(10) = 99`\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step of the formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Möbius function μ(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    \n    # Return 0 if there is any squared prime factor\n    for p in prime_factors:\n        if prime_factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    \n    # Return (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    if len(prime_factors) % 2 != 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 1\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the\n    BCH expansion using Witt's formula and prints the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the coefficients\n    k = 2   # Number of generators (X, Y)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    term_strings = []\n    value_strings = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term_value = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        total_sum += term_value\n        \n        term_strings.append(f\"μ({d})*{k}^({n}/{d})\")\n        value_strings.append(f\"({mu_d})*({k**power})\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Print the detailed calculation\n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"d(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{{d|n}} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\\n\")\n    print(f\"For n={n} and k={k}:\")\n    \n    # Build and print the full equation with symbols\n    full_equation_sym = f\"d({n}) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(term_strings) + \" ]\"\n    print(full_equation_sym)\n    \n    # Build and print the equation with calculated values\n    # Replace \"+ (-\" with \"- \" for cleaner output\n    full_equation_val = f\"d({n}) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(value_strings) + \" ]\"\n    full_equation_val = full_equation_val.replace(\"+ (-\", \"- \")\n    print(full_equation_val)\n\n    print(f\"d({n}) = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\")\n    print(f\"d({n}) = {result}\")\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_bch_coefficients()\nprint(\"\\n<<<99>>>\")\n```"
