    # This implies the damage is primarily a loss of material.

        'A': 'Stress Corrosion Cracking',

    # Analysis of damage types vs. "build-up" repair method:
    # - Cracking (A, E) and Deformation (D) are not primarily material loss issues.
    # - Oxidation/Corrosion (F) is material loss, but less localized for this type of build-up.
    # - Foreign Object Damage (B) causes localized material loss (nicks, gouges) and is a valid answer.
    # - Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is a predictable and routine loss of material at the blade tip,
    #   which is critical for engine efficiency. This repair is a cornerstone of turbine MRO.

    # Conclusion: The most common and routine application for a manual TIG "build-up"
    # process is to restore the blade tip material lost due to rub and wear.
    # While FOD is also repaired this way, tip wear is a more systematic issue
    # that necessitates this exact kind of layered build-up repair.
