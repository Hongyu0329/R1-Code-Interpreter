    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the relevant character from William Morris's novel \"The House of the Wolfings.\" I need to find the character who has firsthand experience with Roman life and religion. Based on the plot, this character is a Gothic woman who was captured and lived among the Romans before returning to her people.\n\nSecond, I will confirm that this character specifically describes the Roman founding myth involving a she-wolf and twins, which is a direct allusion to Romulus and Remus.\n\nFinally, I will create a simple Python script to state the character's name and the context for the answer, as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_character_in_story():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the character from \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    who describes the Roman founding myth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character in the story who was a captive of the Romans.\n    character_name = \"Wood-sun\"\n    \n    # The context of her description.\n    explanation = (\n        \"This character is Wood-sun. She is a woman of the Goths who was captured \"\n        \"and lived in a Roman city. Upon returning to the Wolfings, she describes the Romans' \"\n        \"religious practices and their origin story. She speaks of the 'Wolf-kin of the Romans' \"\n        \"and tells of their city being founded by twin brethren who were suckled by a she-wolf. \"\n        \"This is a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome.\"\n    )\n    \n    # Print the information for the user.\n    print(f\"The character is: {character_name}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Context ---\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_character_in_story()\n```\n<<<Wood-sun>>>"
