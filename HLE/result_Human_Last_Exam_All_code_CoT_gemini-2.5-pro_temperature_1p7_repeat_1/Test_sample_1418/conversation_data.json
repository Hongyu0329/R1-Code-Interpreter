    "To determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Simplify the definition of the field L.**\n    Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n    Let $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the well-known biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group is Gal($F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$, the Klein four-group.\n    The element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $F$. So, $L$ is an extension of $F$ obtained by adjoining $\\sqrt{\\alpha^2}$. This means $L=F(\\alpha)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension.**\n    The degree of $L$ over $F$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\alpha \\in F$ (i.e., $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $F$), and 2 otherwise.\n    We test if $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. A powerful way to check this is using norms. Let's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $F$ to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    $N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta)$, where $\\sigma$ is the automorphism that sends $\\sqrt{3} \\to -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    If $\\beta$ were a square in $F$, say $\\beta=\\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in F$, then its norm would be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$: $N(\\beta) = N(\\gamma^2) = (N(\\gamma))^2$.\n    However, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. (Assuming $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ leads to $u^4-36u^2+288=0$ for $u\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, which has no rational solutions for $u$).\n    Therefore, $\\beta$ is not a square in $F$, so $[L:F] = 2$.\n    The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Identify the group structure.**\n    Since $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$, the Galois group Gal($L/\\mathbb{Q}$) is a group of order 8. To determine which one, we can embed $L$ into a larger, more structured field.\n    Let $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}})$ and $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}})$. These are known to be cyclic extensions of degree 4, i.e., Gal($K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_4$ and Gal($K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_4$.\n    Their intersection is $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Let $K$ be the compositum field $K=K_1 K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}, \\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}})$.\n    The Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups: Gal($K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_4 \\times C_4$. The degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=16$.\n    Our field $L$ is a subfield of $K$ because:\n    *   $\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}})^2-2 \\in K$.\n    *   $\\sqrt{3} = (\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}})^2-3 \\in K$.\n    *   $\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}} \\in K$.\n    Since $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$ and $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=16$, $L$ is a subfield of index 2.\n    By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, Gal($L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) / \\text{Gal}(K/L)$.\n    The group Gal($K/L$) is the subgroup of Gal($K/\\mathbb{Q})$ of order 2 that fixes the field $L$.\n    Let $\\sigma$ be the generator of Gal($K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_4$ and $\\rho$ be the generator of Gal($K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_4$. We can identify Gal($K/\\mathbb{Q})$ with the group generated by $\\sigma$ and $\\rho$. The element that generates Gal($K/L$) must fix the generators of $L$. A key generator is $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}$.\n    The automorphism $\\sigma^2\\rho^2$ acts as follows:\n    *   $\\sigma^2(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}) = -\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\rho^2(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}) = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    *   $\\sigma^2(\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}) = \\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}$ and $\\rho^2(\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}) = -\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}$.\n    Thus, $\\sigma^2\\rho^2(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}) = (-\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}})(-\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}) = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{3+\\sqrt{3}}$. It fixes the main generator. It can be verified it also fixes $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.\n    So, the subgroup Gal($K/L$) is $H = \\langle \\sigma^2\\rho^2 \\rangle \\cong C_2$.\n    The Galois group Gal($L/\\mathbb{Q}$) is the quotient group $(C_4 \\times C_4) / H$.\n    This quotient group is an abelian group of order 8. It contains elements of order 4 (the image of $\\sigma$) but is not cyclic. This leaves only one possibility: $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\nTo verify this result, we can use a computer algebra system like SageMath. The following shell script calls Sage to construct the field and compute its Galois group.\n\n```sh\n#!/usr/bin/env sage\n#\n# This script uses SageMath to compute the Galois group.\n# SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system.\n#\n# Let's define the field L over the rational numbers QQ.\n# It is simpler to define L by finding an irreducible polynomial for a generator.\n# However, it's more direct to use the subfield construction from the larger field K.\n\ntry:\n    # Set up the polynomial ring\n    R_x = QQ['x']\n    x = R_x.gen()\n\n    # Define the fields K1 = Q(sqrt(2+sqrt(2))) and K2 = Q(sqrt(3+sqrt(3)))\n    P1 = x^4 - 4*x^2 + 2\n    K1.<a> = NumberField(P1)\n\n    P2 = x^4 - 6*x^2 + 6\n    K2.<b> = NumberField(P2)\n\n    # Compute the compositum K = K1*K2\n    # Its Galois group is C4 x C4.\n    K, map_K1, map_K2 = K1.composite(K2, both_maps=True)\n\n    # Define the generators of our field L in terms of the generators of K.\n    # a = sqrt(2+sqrt(2)) -> a^2 = 2+sqrt(2) -> sqrt(2) = a^2 - 2\n    # b = sqrt(3+sqrt(3)) -> b^2 = 3+sqrt(3) -> sqrt(3) = b^2 - 3\n    # alpha = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))) = a*b\n    \n    gen_sqrt2 = map_K1(a^2 - 2)\n    gen_sqrt3 = map_K2(b^2 - 3)\n    gen_alpha = map_K1(a) * map_K2(b)\n\n    # Construct L as a subfield of K.\n    L, map_L_K, map_K_L = K.subfield([gen_sqrt2, gen_sqrt3, gen_alpha])\n\n    # Compute the Galois group of L over Q.\n    G = L.galois_group()\n\n    # Print the structure of the group.\n    print(G.structure_description())\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An error occurred.
