# Step 1: Define the constant from the problem statement.
# The constraint is alpha + beta + gamma = C * (1 - exp(-T)), where C = 10^25.
C = 10**25

# Step 2: Derive the equation for the sphere of initial values (x0, y0, z0).
# From the analysis, we found that 2 * (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2) = C.
# So, the equation for the sphere is x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = C / 2.
# This means the radius squared (R^2) of the sphere is C / 2.
R_squared = C / 2

# Step 3: Calculate the surface area of the sphere.
# The formula for the surface area of a sphere is A = 4 * pi * R^2.
Area = 4 * math.pi * R_squared

# Step 4: Output the results, showing the final equation and the numbers involved.
