    "To find the value of a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables, we need to refer to a known sequence from switching theory and combinatorics.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Sequence**: The sequence `a(n)` for the maximal number of prime implicants is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A000373.\n2.  **Find the Known Values**: The sequence begins with `a(0) = 1`, `a(1) = 2`, `a(2) = 4`, `a(3) = 10`, `a(4) = 26`, and so on. Deriving these values from scratch is a complex task involving advanced logic synthesis concepts, and there is no simple formula that works for all `n`.\n3.  **Write the Code**: I will provide a Python script that uses these known values to find `a(4)`. The code will store the first few terms of the sequence and retrieve the value for n=4. It will then print the result in the form of an equation as requested.\n\nThis approach is the most reliable way to obtain the correct answer, as it relies on established mathematical results.\n\n```python\ndef get_max_prime_implicants(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function\n    of n variables, by looking up the value from a list of known results.\n\n    This sequence is known as OEIS A000373. The values are established in\n    combinatorics and logic synthesis literature. There is no simple\n    closed-form formula for a(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known values for the sequence a(n)\n    # a(0), a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4), ...\n    known_sequence = [1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232]\n\n    if 0 <= n < len(known_sequence):\n        return known_sequence[n]\n    else:\n        # For values of n not in this list, a more complex algorithm or\n        # an extended sequence table would be required.\n        raise ValueError(f\"Value for n={n} is not in the pre-computed list.\")\n\n# The user wants to find the value of a(4).\nn_value = 4\n\n# Calculate the result.\nresult = get_max_prime_implicants(n_value)\n\n# Print the final result in an equation format.\nprint(f\"a({n_value}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<26>>>"
