    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then analyze the structures of African flags.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Flag of Denmark**: The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red background. When viewed as a matrix, it's composed of two distinct types of rows:\n    *   Rows corresponding to the horizontal bar of the cross (e.g., a vector of all 'white' values).\n    *   Rows corresponding to the red field, which are intersected by the vertical bar of the cross (e.g., a vector like `[red, red, ..., white, ..., red, red]`).\n    These two types of rows are linearly independent. Assuming the \"maximal rank\" condition means we assign distinct values to distinct colors, the number of linearly independent rows is 2. Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze African Flags**: We will search for African flags whose geometric structure also results in exactly two linearly independent row (or column) types.\n    *   **High-Rank Flags**: Flags with three or more horizontal/vertical stripes (e.g., Gabon, Nigeria), flags with diagonal elements (e.g., Namibia, Tanzania), and flags with complex emblems or triangles (e.g., Kenya, Mozambique) will generate more than two unique row types and thus have a rank greater than 2.\n    *   **Rank-2 Flags**: A flag will have a rank of 2 if its design is based on exactly two unique structural patterns for its rows. Simple horizontal or vertical bicolors would qualify. A less obvious case is a flag composed of a vertical bar at the hoist next to two horizontal bars, as this also creates exactly two unique row types.\n\n3.  **Identify Matching Flags**: By examining the designs of all African national flags, we find that most have ranks of 3 or higher. However, two flags share a unique structure that results in a rank of 2:\n    *   **Benin**: Has a vertical green band at the hoist, with a yellow horizontal band and a red horizontal band stacked next to it. This creates two row patterns: `[Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow]` and `[Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red]`. These are two linearly independent vectors.\n    *   **Madagascar**: Has a vertical white band at the hoist, with a red horizontal band and a green horizontal band stacked next to it. This structure is identical to Benin's and also results in a rank of 2.\n\nThe following Python code systematically applies this logic to find the flags with a rank of 2.\n\n```python\ndef find_flags_with_matching_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies African flags with the same linear algebraic rank as Denmark's flag.\n\n    The rank of a flag is determined by its geometric structure, assuming maximal rank\n    where different colors correspond to linearly independent values.\n\n    Rank of Denmark's flag: The Nordic cross design creates two unique, linearly\n    independent row types.
