def solve_type_theory_problem():
    """
    This function identifies the axiom inconsistent with structural recursion
    in the context of dependent type theory, as described in the problem.

    The problem describes a situation that leads to Girard's Paradox, where
    a non-terminating term can be constructed. This paradox arises from
    impredicative features, such as a universe containing itself or an axiom
    that simulates this.

    The axioms are:
    A. Propositional extensionality
    B. Functional extensionality
    C. Propositional resizing
    D. Uniqueness of identity proofs
    E. Proof irrelevance
    F. Double-negation elimination
    G. Constructive indefinite description
    H. Excluded middle
    I. Markov's principle

    The 'Propositional resizing' axiom is known to reintroduce the impredicativity
    that leads to Girard's Paradox by allowing the collapse of the universe
    hierarchy that is designed to prevent it. This makes the system inconsistent
    by breaking the termination guarantee of structural recursion.
