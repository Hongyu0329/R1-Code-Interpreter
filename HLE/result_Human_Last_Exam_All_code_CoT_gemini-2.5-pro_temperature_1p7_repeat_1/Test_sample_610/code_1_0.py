    # This is a dummy function for reasoning. The problem is analytical.
    # The value is claimed to be independent of n and b for n>=10, b in (0,1).
    # The derivation for b->0 gives the result 4.
    
    # Let's write down the analytical result based on the derivation
    # Step 1: In the limit b->0, G becomes the identity matrix I.
    # Step 2: f_3(k, e_p) needs to be calculated.
    # f_1(k, a) vector has components [f_1(k, a)]_m = (n+1-2k)a_m - sum_l |a_m - a_l|
    # For a=e_p:
    # m=p: a_m=1. [f_1(k,e_p)]_p = (n+1-2k) - (n-1) = 2-2k
    # m!=p: a_m=0. [f_1(k,e_p)]_m = 0 - 1 = -1
    # Step 3: f_3(k, e_p) = min(argmax(f_1(k, e_p)))
    # If k=1, 2-2k=0. We compare 0 and -1. Max is 0, at index p. f_3(1, e_p) = p.
    # If k>=2, 2-2k < 0. We compare a negative number with -1. Max is -1.
    # Argmax is {1,...,n}\{p}. The minimum of this set is 1 (if p>1) or 2 (if p=1).
    
    # Step 4: Trace calculation for l(n, 0)
    # l(n,0) = 2 * sum_p Tr(C_p(0))
    # Tr(C_p) = sum_i delta_{i, f_3(i, e_p)}
    
    # For p=1:
    # i=1: f_3(1,e_1)=1. A term delta_{1,1}=1.
    # i>=2: f_3(i,e_1)=2. A term delta_{2,2}=1 for i=2.
    # Tr(C_1) = 1 + 1 = 2
    
    # For p>1:
    # i=1: f_3(1,e_p)=p. delta_{1,p}=0.
    # i>=2: f_3(i,e_p)=1. delta_{i,1}=0.
    # Tr(C_p) for p>1 is 0.
    
    # Total sum: sum_p Tr(C_p) = Tr(C_1) + sum_{p=2..n} Tr(C_p) = 2 + 0 = 2.
    
    # Final value l = 2 * (total sum) = 2 * 2 = 4.
    
    # We output the derived value.
    final_value = 4
