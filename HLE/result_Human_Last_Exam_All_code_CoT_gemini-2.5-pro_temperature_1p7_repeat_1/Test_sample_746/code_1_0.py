    print("Problem: For a connected topological space X, a point x is a dispersion point if X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.")
    print("Suppose X is a compact connected metric space. What is the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points?")
    print("\n--- Step 1: Establishing a Lower Bound (The number is at least 1) ---")
    print("First, we show that it is possible to have one dispersion point.")
    print("The Knaster-Kuratowski fan is a well-known example of a compact connected metric space.")
    print("This space has exactly one dispersion point (its apex).")
    print("This confirms that a maximum cardinality of at least 1 is possible.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Proving the Upper Bound (The number is less than 2) ---")
    print("Next, we prove by contradiction that there cannot be more than one dispersion point.")
    print("Let's assume a compact connected metric space X has two distinct dispersion points, d1 and d2.")
    
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("1. Since d1 is a dispersion point, the space X \\ {d1} is totally disconnected.")
    print("2. A theorem in topology states: If X \\ {p} is totally disconnected, then X is locally connected at every point in X \\ {p}.")
    print("3. From this theorem, since d2 is a point in X \\ {d1}, the space X must be locally connected at d2.")
    print("4. A second theorem states: If X is locally connected at a point p, then there exists an open connected neighborhood U of p such that U \\ {p} is connected.")
    print("5. Applying this to d2, there must be an open connected neighborhood U of d2 where U \\ {d2} is connected.")
    print("6. Now we have a contradiction. Because d2 is a dispersion point, X \\ {d2} is totally disconnected. Since U \\ {d2} is a subset of X \\ {d2}, it must also be totally disconnected.")
    print("7. Therefore, the set U \\ {d2} must be both connected and totally disconnected.")
    print("8. The only way this is possible is if U \\ {d2} is a single point. This would mean U is a two-point open set, which is impossible in a connected metric space (as it would partition the space).")
    print("9. The contradiction proves our initial assumption that two dispersion points can exist is false.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Conclusion ---")
    print("From Step 1, the maximum number of dispersion points is at least 1.")
    print("From Step 2, the maximum number must be less than 2.")
    print("Combining these results, the maximum possible cardinality is 1.")
