    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the quantum fields are represented by anti-commuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. The Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state, is encoded in the algebraic properties of these variables.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will explain the core algebraic property of Grassmann variables that corresponds to the Pauli principle. This is the property of nilpotency, meaning the square of any Grassmann variable is zero.\n2.  Next, I will explain how integration over these variables (the Berezin integral) is defined. The \"measure\" for this integral is not a number itself but is defined by a set of rules that give numerical answers for basic integrals. These rules are chosen to be consistent with the algebraic properties.\n3.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that models the behavior of a single Grassmann variable. The code will create a simple class to represent functions of a Grassmann variable and demonstrate both the algebraic property (Pauli principle) and the fundamental integration rules that define the measure. The script will print out the key equations and their numerical results.\n\nThe key property of a Grassmann variable `η` that enforces the Pauli exclusion principle is that it is nilpotent, i.e., its square is zero:\n`η² = 0`\n\nThe integral measure `dη` is then defined by a set of rules consistent with this. For a function `f(η) = A + Bη` (any higher powers of `η` are zero), the Berezin integral is defined as:\n`∫ dη f(η) = B`\n\nThis definition arises from two fundamental rules:\n1.  The integral of a constant is 0: `∫ dη A = 0`\n2.  The integral of the variable itself is 1 (by convention): `∫ dη η = 1`\n\nThe value `0` for the square of a Grassmann variable `η` (and thus the integral of `η²`) is the most direct mathematical consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle within this formalism.\n\nHere is a Python script to demonstrate these properties.\n\n```python\nclass GrassmannPolynomial:\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents a polynomial of a single Grassmann variable eta: c0 + c1*η.\n    The core property η*η = 0 is enforced in the multiplication.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, c0, c1):\n        # c0 is the constant part, c1 is the coefficient of eta\n        self.c0 = float(c0)\n        self.c1 = float(c1)\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        # (a0 + a1*η) + (b0 + b1*η) = (a0+b0) + (a1+b1)*η\n        return GrassmannPolynomial(self.c0 + other.c0, self.c1 + other.c1)\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        # (a0 + a1*η) * (b0 + b1*η) = a0*b0 + a0*b1*η + a1*b0*η + a1*b1*η*η\n        # Since η*η = 0, this simplifies to: a0*b0 + (a0*b1 + a1*b0)*η\n        new_c0 = self.c0 * other.c0\n        new_c1 = self.c0 * other.c1 + self.c1 * other.c0\n        return GrassmannPolynomial(new_c0, new_c1)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        # Pretty printing for the polynomial\n        # Handle the case where the polynomial is exactly zero\n        if self.c0 == 0 and self.c1 == 0:\n            return \"0\"\n\n        c0_str = f\"{self.c0}\" if self.c0 != 0 else \"\"\n        c1_str = \"\"\n\n        if self.c1 != 0:\n            sign = \"+\" if self.c1 > 0 else \"-\"\n            val = abs(self.c1)\n            # Add spacing and sign only if there is a c0 term\n            if c0_str:\n                c1_str = f\" {sign} {val}η\"\n            else:\n                c1_str = f\"{sign.strip()} {val}η\" if sign == \"-\" else f\"{val}η\"\n\n        return c0_str + c1_str\n\ndef berezin_integral(poly):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the Berezin integral: ∫ dη (c0 + c1*η) = c1.\n    \"\"\"\n    return poly.c1\n\n# Main part of the script to demonstrate the concepts\nprint(\"This script demonstrates the key properties of Grassmann variables and their integration.\")\nprint(\"These are used to enforce the Pauli exclusion principle in path integrals.\\n\")\n\n# 1.
