    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of side stickers a person must look at to uniquely identify which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases they are facing.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the problem:** We are trying to distinguish between 21 possible states using information from the colors of the side stickers of the top layer. The top-facing stickers are all correctly oriented (e.g., yellow), so they provide no information.\n2.  **Calculate the theoretical minimum:** Using information theory, we can find the absolute lowest possible number of stickers, assuming sticker color combinations were optimally distributed among the PLL cases. The formula is `C^k >= N`, where `C` is the number of possible colors for a sticker (4), `N` is the number of cases (21), and `k` is the number of stickers we observe.\n3.  **Test the practical minimum:** The cube's mechanics prevent perfect information distribution. We'll test if the theoretical minimum is enough in a real-world scenario by showing a counterexample.\n4.  **Identify the true minimum:** We will find the actual minimum number of stickers by considering what information is needed to distinguish the most similar and difficult PLL cases. This leads to the correct answer.\n5.  **Output the result:** The final python code will print the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_pll_sticker_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    needed to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part 1: Problem Definition\n    print(\"--- The Problem ---\")\n    num_pll_cases = 21\n    # On a standard cube (e.g. Yellow top, White bottom), the side faces\n    # can be one of four colors (e.g., Blue, Red, Green, Orange).\n    num_side_colors = 4\n    print(f\"We need to distinguish between {num_pll_cases} different PLL cases.\")\n    print(f\"The information comes from observing the {num_side_colors} possible colors on the side stickers of the last layer.\\n\")\n\n    # Part 2: Theoretical Minimum\n    print(\"--- Step 1: The Theoretical Minimum ---\")\n    # We need to find the smallest integer k such that num_colors^k >= num_cases\n    theoretical_min_stickers = math.ceil(math.log(num_pll_cases, num_side_colors))\n    print(\"The theoretical minimum number of stickers (k) required can be calculated using the formula: colors^k >= cases\")\n    print(f\"For our problem, this equation is: {num_side_colors}^k >= {num_pll_cases}\")\n    print(f\"To solve for k, we use a logarithm: k >= log{num_side_colors}({num_pll_cases})\")\n    print(f\"k >= {math.log(num_pll_cases, num_side_colors):.3f}\")\n    print(f\"Since k must be an integer, the theoretical minimum is {theoretical_min_stickers}.\\n\")\n\n\n    # Part 3: Practical Limitations\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Testing the Practical Minimum ---\")\n    print(f\"However, the theoretical minimum of {theoretical_min_stickers} stickers is not sufficient in practice.\")\n    print(\"This is because the mechanical constraints of the cube mean that some PLLs will have identical sticker patterns on any given set of 3 stickers.\")\n    print(\"\\nCounterexample: Why 3 stickers are not enough.\")\n    print(\"Consider the H-Perm (swaps opposite edges) and a solved case (PLL skip).\")\n    print(\"If we observe only 3 corner stickers (e.g., the front-facing sticker of the two front corners and the right-facing sticker of the front-right corner), their colors will be identical for both cases because neither the H-perm nor the solved case permutes any corners.\")\n    print(\"Thus, a minimum of 3 stickers is not enough.\\n\")\n\n\n    # Part 4: The Actual Minimum Required\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Finding the True Minimum ---\")\n    print(\"The actual minimum number of stickers that must be seen is 4.\")\n    print(\"To distinguish all 21 cases, one must observe a combination of corner and edge stickers that provides enough information to differentiate even the most similar-looking cases (like the various G-perms).\")\n    print(\"A specific set of 4 stickers is sufficient.
