    "This is a question about a known result in mathematical analysis, specifically at the intersection of fractal geometry and harmonic analysis. I will provide a Python script that states and explains this established result.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the key concepts:**\n    *   A **Sidon set** (or Bâ‚‚-set) is a set of numbers `A` where for any elements `a, b, c, d` in `A`, if `a + b = c + d`, it must be that `{a, b} = {c, d}`. In simple terms, all sums of two elements are unique (up to the order of the summands).\n    *   **Hausdorff dimension** is a concept from fractal geometry that generalizes the notion of dimension to any real number, allowing us to measure the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of sets like the Cantor set.\n\n2.  **State the established theorem:** It is a well-established mathematical theorem that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set contained in the interval `[0, 1]` cannot be greater than 1/2. Furthermore, this upper bound is \"sharp,\" which means there do exist Sidon sets in `[0, 1]` that have a Hausdorff dimension of exactly 1/2.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the *maximum* possible Hausdorff dimension for such a set is 1/2.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** The Python script will not compute this value from scratch, as that would require symbolic proof of advanced theorems. Instead, it will present this known fact clearly, showing the components of the final fraction as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hausdorff_dimension_of_sidon_set():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the established mathematical answer to the question about\n    the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in [0, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The answer is a known mathematical constant, represented as a fraction.\n    # We define the numerator and denominator to fulfill the requirement of\n    # outputting each number in the final equation.\n    numerator = 1\n    denominator = 2\n\n    # The result is the division of the numerator by the denominator.\n    max_dimension = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Print the explanation for the user.\n    print(\"The question asks for the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].\")\n    print(\"This is a known result from mathematical analysis.\")\n    print(\"\\n- A Sidon set is a set where all sums of two distinct elements are unique.\")\n    print(\"- The Hausdorff dimension measures the 'fractal' size of a set.\")\n    print(\"\\nIt has been proven that this dimension can be no larger than 1/2, and that Sidon sets with a dimension of exactly 1/2 can be constructed.\")\n    \n    # As requested, output the numbers in the final equation.\n    print(f\"\\nThe value is the result of the equation: {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n\n    # Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension is: {max_dimension}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution.\nsolve_hausdorff_dimension_of_sidon_set()\n```\n<<<0.5>>>"
