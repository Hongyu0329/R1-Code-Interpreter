    "Based on my research, the premise of your question appears to be incorrect. Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Nnamdi Azikiwe was a separate, prominent Nigerian political figure who served as the first President of Nigeria. There is no public record of Goodluck Jonathan ever using the name \"Azikiwe\" or identifying himself as such.\n\nTherefore, I will provide a Python script to clarify this information.\n\n```python\ndef explain_name_facts():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan and the name 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    person_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    other_historical_figure = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    explanation = (\n        f\"The premise of the question contains a factual inaccuracy.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"The full name of the former Nigerian President is {person_in_question}.\\n\"\n        f\"He has never publicly identified himself with the name 'Azikiwe'.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"The name 'Azikiwe' is famously associated with {other_historical_figure}, \"\n        f\"the first President of Nigeria.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"Therefore, there is no year in which Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly \"\n        f\"identified himself as Azikiwe.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_name_facts()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe.>>>"
