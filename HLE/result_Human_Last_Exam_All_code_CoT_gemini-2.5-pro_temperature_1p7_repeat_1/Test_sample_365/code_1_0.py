# The reaction is an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement, which is an isomerization.
# Therefore, the product has the same molecular formula as the reactant.
# Here we calculate the molecular formula of the product by calculating the formula of the reactant.

# Elemental composition of the starting material/product:
# Carbons (C):
#   Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core = 7
#   Two methoxy groups (-OCH3) = 2 * 1 = 2
#   Cyclopentene ring = 5
#   tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) group = 2 (dimethyl) + 4 (t-butyl) = 6
#   Total C = 7 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 20

# Hydrogens (H):
#   On the bicycloheptene carbon skeleton = 6
#   From the alcohol (-OH) group = 1
#   From the two methoxy groups = 2 * 3 = 6
#   On the cyclopentene carbon skeleton = 6
#   From the TBDMS group = 6 (dimethyl) + 9 (t-butyl) = 15
#   Total H = 6 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 15 = 34

# Oxygens (O):
#   From the alcohol group = 1
#   From the dimethoxy ketal = 2
#   From the silyl ether group = 1
#   Total O = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

# Silicon (Si):
#   From the TBDMS group = 1
#   Total Si = 1
