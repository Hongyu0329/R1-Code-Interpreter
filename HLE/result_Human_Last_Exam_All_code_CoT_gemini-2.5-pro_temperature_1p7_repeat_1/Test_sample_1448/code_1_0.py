    # The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is a central equation in quantum many-body theory.
    # It calculates the two-particle response of a system.
    # The two key constructs in this relationship are:
    component1 = "Scattering amplitude" # This is what the BSE solves for, related to the full two-particle Green's function.
    component2 = "Interaction kernel"   # This is the input to the BSE, representing all two-particle irreducible interactions.
