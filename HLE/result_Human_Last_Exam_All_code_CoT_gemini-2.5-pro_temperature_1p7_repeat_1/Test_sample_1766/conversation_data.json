    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$, and as it's an electron, its spin quantum number is $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum ($j$):** The total angular momentum is the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$. The corresponding total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, can take values from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number ($m_j$):** For each value of $j$, the magnetic quantum number, $m_j$, can take $2j+1$ values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:** The operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ commute, so they share a common set of eigenstates, which can be denoted as $|j, m_j\\rangle$. We will calculate the eigenvalues for these operators.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for $J^2$ is: $J^2 |j, m_j\\rangle = \\hbar^2 j(j+1) |j, m_j\\rangle$.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for $J_z$ is: $J_z |j, m_j\\rangle = \\hbar m_j |j, m_j\\rangle$.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that carries out these steps. It will iterate through all possible $j$ and $m_j$ values, calculate the corresponding eigenvalues for $J^2$ (in units of $\\hbar^2$) and $J_z$ (in units of $\\hbar$), and then print the complete eigenvalue equations for each common eigenstate. I will use the `fractions` module to ensure half-integer values are displayed clearly as fractions.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, orbital angular momentum l = {l} and spin s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"The total angular momentum J = L + S.\")\n    print(\"The common eigenstates of J^2 and J_z are denoted by |j, m_j>.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    # Step 3, 4, 5: Iterate through j and m_j, then calculate and print eigenvalues\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue factor\n        j2_eigenvalue_factor = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # Use Fraction for clean output of half-integer numbers\n        j_frac = Fraction(j).limit_denominator()\n        j2_eigenvalue_factor_frac = Fraction(j2_eigenvalue_factor).limit_denominator()\n\n        print(f\"\\nFor the states with total angular momentum j = {j_frac}:\")\n        \n        # Determine possible m_j values\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # J_z eigenvalue factor is just mj\n            mj_frac = Fraction(mj).limit_denominator()\n            \n            # Print the eigenvalue equations for the state |j, mj>\n            print(f\"\\n  For the state |j={j_frac}, m_j={mj_frac}>:\")\n            print(f\"    The J^2 eigenvalue equation is: J^2 |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}> = {j2_eigenvalue_factor_frac} \\u0127\\u00b2 |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}>\")\n            print(f\"    The J_z eigenvalue equation is: J_z |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}> = {mj_frac} \\u0127 |{j_frac}, {mj_frac}>\")\n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<For j=3/2 the J^2 eigenvalue is 15/4 * hbar^2 with J_z eigenvalues of {3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2} * hbar.
