    "To solve this problem, we need to find all the ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. I will use a backtracking algorithm to solve this problem.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define Toroidal Attack Rules:** First, I'll establish what it means for two queens to \"attack\" on a toroidal board.\n    *   **Rows/Columns:** Same as a standard board. If two queens are in the same row or column, they attack each other.\n    *   **Diagonals:** This is where the \"toroidal\" or \"wrap-around\" nature matters. Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other diagonally if the shortest row distance between them equals the shortest column distance. The shortest distance on a 5x5 board between two points `a` and `b` is `min(abs(a - b), 5 - abs(a - b))`.\n\n2.  **Backtracking Algorithm:** I will write a recursive function to explore all possible placements of the 4 queens.\n    *   The function will place one queen at a time on an empty square.\n    *   Before placing a queen, it checks if the square is safe (i.e., not attacked by any queens already on the board).\n    *   If the square is safe, it places the queen and recursively calls itself to place the next queen.\n    *   If a placement of all 4 queens is successful, it increments a counter.\n    *   The function then \"backtracks\" by removing the queen to explore other possibilities.\n    *   To avoid counting the same set of 4 positions in different orders, the search for the next queen's position will always start from the cell after the last placed queen.\n\n3.  **Final Count:** The program will execute the backtracking function and print the final total count of valid arrangements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n    \n    # Using a list to hold the count so it can be modified within the nested function\n    solution_count = [0]\n\n    def is_attacked(p1, p2):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if two queens at positions p1 and p2 attack each other on the NxN toroidal board.\n        p1 and p2 are tuples (row, col).\n        \"\"\"\n        r1, c1 = p1\n        r2, c2 = p2\n\n        # Check for row or column attack\n        if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n            return True\n\n        # Check for toroidal diagonal attack\n        dr = abs(r1 - r2)\n        dc = abs(c1 - c2)\n        if min(dr, N - dr) == min(dc, N - dc):\n            return True\n\n        return False\n\n    def backtrack(k, start_index, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively finds valid placements for the queens.\n        k: The number of queens still to be placed.\n        start_index: The linear index on the board (0 to 24) to start searching from.\n                     This prevents duplicate combinations.\n        placements: A list of (row, col) tuples of queens already placed.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If all queens have been placed, we found a solution.\n        if k == 0:\n            solution_count[0] += 1\n            return\n\n        # Optimization: if not enough squares are left for the remaining queens, prune this branch.\n        if N * N - start_index < k:\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through all possible cells starting from start_index\n        for i in range(start_index, N * N):\n            r = i // N\n            c = i % N\n            current_pos = (r, c)\n            \n            # Check if placing a queen at current_pos is safe\n            is_safe = True\n            for queen_pos in placements:\n                if is_attacked(current_pos, queen_pos):\n                    is_safe = False\n                    break\n            \n            # If it's safe, place the queen and recurse\n            if is_safe:\n                placements.append(current_pos)\n                backtrack(k - 1, i + 1, placements)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities\n                placements.pop()\n\n    # Start the backtracking process to place NUM_QUEENS queens\n    backtrack(NUM_QUEENS, 0, [])\n\n    print(f\"Number of ways to place {NUM_QUEENS} non-attacking queens on a {N}x{N} toroidal chessboard: {solution_count[0]}\")\n\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<400>>>\n```"
