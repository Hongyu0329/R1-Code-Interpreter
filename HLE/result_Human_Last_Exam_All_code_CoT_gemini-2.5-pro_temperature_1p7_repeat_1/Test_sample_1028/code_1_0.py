# Analysis of the Problem

The core issue is the non-identifiability of time-varying speciation (λ(t)) and extinction (μ(t)) rates from a phylogeny of only extant species. This means that multiple pairs of (λ(t), μ(t)) can generate the exact same data, making it impossible to distinguish them.

A strategy helps mitigate this issue if it either:
1.  Adds new information (e.g., fossils, strong priors) to constrain the possible rate functions.
2.  Reformulates the model to estimate parameter combinations that are mathematically identifiable.

# Evaluation of Options

*   **B, D, F - Add Information:** Incorporating priors (B) or fossils (D, F) adds new information to the analysis. Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages, which is crucial for estimating extinction rates independently of speciation rates. Priors constrain the parameter space. These strategies help.

*   **E, G - Reformulate the Model:** Reparameterizing to infer identifiable quantities like the pulled diversification rate (E) or pulled speciation rate (G) is a standard and valid way to handle non-identifiability. You focus on what the data can actually tell you. These strategies help.

*   **A, C - Change Model Parameterization:** These options change how the unknown functions λ(t) and μ(t) are modeled (piecewise-constant vs. polynomials) but add no new data or constraints. They do not solve the fundamental mathematical non-identifiability.

*   **Why C is the correct answer:** While neither A nor C solves the problem, option C actively makes the situation worse. Fitting a model with high-degree polynomials introduces a very large number of parameters and extreme model flexibility. This flexibility, without new data to justify it, amplifies the identifiability problem. It becomes even easier for vastly different rate functions to fit the data equally well, leading to unstable and unreliable inferences. Therefore, this strategy does not help mitigate the issue; it exacerbates it.
