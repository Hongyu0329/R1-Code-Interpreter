# Step 1: Identify the points that lie on the boundary of exactly one region.
# These points are the "dangling" endpoints of the various segments.

# Number of inner endpoints of the four spokes L1, L2, L3, L4.
# These are (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), (-1/2, 0), (0, -1/2).
# Each of these is only on the boundary of the inner region R1.
num_inner_endpoints = 4

# Number of outer endpoints of the spokes that are not connected to other parts of the set.
# The spokes L1 and L3 have dangling outer endpoints at (0, 3/2) and (-3/2, 0).
# These are only on the boundary of the unbounded region R3.
# The outer endpoints of L2 and L4 are connected by the arc C2, so they are on the boundary of two regions (R2 and R3).
num_dangling_outer_endpoints = 2

# Number of endpoints of the horizontal segment L5.
# These are (-1/2, 1) and (1/2, 1). They are attached to the unit circle at their midpoint,
# so their endpoints are dangling and are only on the boundary of the unbounded region R3.
num_L5_endpoints = 2

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of such points.
total_points = num_inner_endpoints + num_dangling_outer_endpoints + num_L5_endpoints

# Step 3: Print the result in a descriptive equation.
