    "Here is my plan to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n1.  I will first identify the most well-known allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  For each allotrope, I will identify its characteristic color(s). Note that some allotropes, like white phosphorus, are often observed as another color (yellow) due to impurities or degradation.\n3.  I will compile a list of all distinct colors identified from the allotropes.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that defines this list of colors, prints an equation representing the count of these colors, and outputs the total number. The script will also list the colors for clarity.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts and displays the number of observable colors\n    in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Allotropes and their colors:\n    # 1. White Phosphorus (can also appear Yellow)\n    # 2. Red Phosphorus\n    # 3. Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus)\n    # 4. Black Phosphorus\n    # 5. Scarlet Phosphorus\n    # 6. Blue Phosphorus (a 2D form)\n    colors = [\"White\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\", \"Violet\", \"Black\", \"Scarlet\", \"Blue\"]\n    \n    num_colors = len(colors)\n    \n    print(\"The allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in several distinct colors.\")\n    print(\"The colors are: \" + \", \".join(colors) + \".\")\n    \n    # Building and printing the equation as requested\n    equation_str = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * num_colors)\n    print(f\"The total number of colors is derived from the following calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<7>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
