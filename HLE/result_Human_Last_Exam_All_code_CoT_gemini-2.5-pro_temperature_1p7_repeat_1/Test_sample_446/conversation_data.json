    "The task is to identify which of the provided RGD-containing peptides is most likely to bind an integrin receptor. All options contain the core 'RGD' motif, which is the primary recognition sequence for many integrins. However, the amino acids flanking this motif are crucial as they determine the peptide's conformation and binding affinity/specificity.\n\nMy plan is to evaluate each peptide based on its similarity to known high-affinity binding sequences found in natural integrin ligands, such as fibronectin.\n\n1.  **Analyze the common motif:** All peptides have the `RGD` sequence. This is the baseline requirement.\n2.  **Evaluate flanking sequences:** I will look for flanking sequences that are known to confer high affinity. Specifically, a proline (P) immediately following the aspartate (D) is known to induce a specific β-turn structure that is highly favorable for binding to certain integrins, like α5β1.\n3.  **Check for natural analogs:** I will compare the peptides to the sequence of the main cell-binding domain in fibronectin, a canonical integrin ligand.\n4.  **Create a Python script:** The script will encode this biological knowledge. It will store information about each peptide and analyze it to find the one with the strongest evidence of being a high-affinity binder.\n5.  **Print the result:** The script will print its analysis and identify the best candidate.\n\nBased on this plan, the peptide `RGDSPSS` (Choice B) stands out because the `RGDSP` sequence is a well-documented and crucial part of the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, known for high-affinity integrin binding. The other peptides lack such well-known enhancing sequences.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_integrin_binding_peptides():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of RGD-containing peptides to determine which is most likely\n    to bind an integrin receptor with high affinity based on known biological data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary containing the peptides and an explanation of their binding likelihood.\n    # The explanation is based on established biochemical knowledge.\n    peptide_info = {\n        'A.
