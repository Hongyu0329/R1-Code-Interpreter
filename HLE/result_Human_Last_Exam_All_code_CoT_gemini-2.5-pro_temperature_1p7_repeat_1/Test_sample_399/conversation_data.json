    "To solve the initial value problem, we will first find the general solution to the differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the particular solution. Finally, we will evaluate the particular solution at the desired point.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Separate the variables**: The given differential equation $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. We can separate the variables $x$ and $t$ to get all $x$ terms on one side and all $t$ terms on the other:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n    $$\n2.  **Integrate both sides**: Next, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    This yields:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n3.  **Apply the initial condition**: We use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the value of $C$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n4.  **Find the particular solution**: Now, we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n    Solving for $x(t)$, we get:\n    $$\n    x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\left(\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{t - \\frac{t^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}}\n    $$\n    To simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 8:\n    $$\n    x(t) = \\frac{8}{8t - 4t^2 - 1}\n    $$\n5.  **Calculate x(1)**: Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution to find $x(1)$.\n\nThe following Python code performs the final calculation and prints out each step.\n\n```python\n# We need to calculate x(1) using the derived particular solution.\n# The formula is x(t) = 8 / (8*t - 4*t^2 - 1).\n\n# Set the value for t\nt = 1\n\n# Define the components of the equation\nnumerator = 8\nterm1_den = 8 * t\nterm2_den = 4 * t**2\nterm3_den = 1\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = term1_den - term2_den - term3_den\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the step-by-step evaluation of the final equation\nprint(f\"The particular solution is x(t) = 8 / (8*t - 4*t^2 - 1).\")\nprint(f\"We need to find x(1), so we substitute t = {t}:\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 8 / (8 * {t} - 4 * {t}^2 - 1)\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 8 / ({term1_den} - {term2_den} - {term3_den})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = 8 / ({denominator})\")\nprint(f\"The value of x(1) is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
