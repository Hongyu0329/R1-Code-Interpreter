    # --- Statement A ---
    print("Analyzing Statement A: 'CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.'")
    print(" > Based on Fact 1 and Fact 2, CA thrives on raffinose (an RFO) while MA does not. This statement is a direct conclusion from the text.")
    print(" > Verdict: TRUE.\n")

    # --- Statement B ---
    print("Analyzing Statement B: 'CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.'")
    print(" > The text states CA 'did well' on a raffinose diet and MA 'did well' on a sucrose diet. 'Doing well' indicates preference or adaptation.")
    print(" > Verdict: TRUE.\n")

    # --- Statement C ---
    print("Analyzing Statement C: 'Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.'")
    print(" > The transfer is CA from watermelon (raffinose-rich) to cotton (raffinose-poor, Facts 4 & 5).")
    print(" > The aphid encounters less raffinose, so it would produce less galactosidase enzyme (Fact 3).")
    print(" > The cause ('lower raffinose') and effect ('decreased activity') are logically and biologically sound.")
    print(" > Verdict: TRUE.\n")

    # --- Statement D ---
    print("Analyzing Statement D: 'Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.'")
    print(" > The effect ('decreased galactosidase activity') is correct, as explained for C.")
    print(" > However, the stated cause is 'higher glucose levels'.")
    print(" > The most direct cause for a decrease in a specific enzyme's activity is the lack of its substrate (raffinose), as stated in Fact 3.")
    print(" > While other sugars can sometimes influence enzyme production, attributing the change to glucose instead of the lack of raffinose is an incorrect explanation.")
    print(" > Verdict: NOT TRUE, because it provides an incorrect reason for the outcome.\n")

    # --- Statement E ---
    print("Analyzing Statement E: 'Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.'")
    print(" > The transfer is MA from cotton (raffinose-poor) to watermelon (raffinose-rich, Facts 4 & 5).")
    print(" > The aphid encounters more raffinose, so to adapt, it would need to increase its production of galactosidase (Fact 3).")
    print(" > The cause ('higher raffinose') and effect ('increased activity') are logically and biologically sound.")
