    "The user wants me to determine the number of Tverberg's partitions for a specific type of point set.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I will first analyze the problem statement. It describes a set of `n` points, `X`, in `R^d`. The key property of this set is that for a given numerical partition of `n` (`n = a_1 + ... + a_r`), *every* Tverberg partition of `X` corresponds to this numerical partition. This means the multiset of sizes of the subsets in any Tverberg partition `(X_1, ..., X_r)` is always `{a_1, ..., a_r}`.\n\n2.  **Reframe as a Counting Problem:** The question \"What is the number of Tverberg’s partitions of X?\" becomes a combinatorial counting problem. A Tverberg partition is an **ordered** `r`-tuple of subsets `(X_1, ..., X_r)`. Therefore, the problem is to count the number of ways to partition a labeled set of `n` points into an ordered `r`-tuple of subsets whose sizes are a permutation of `a_1, ..., a_r`.\n\n3.  **Derive the Formula:** I will solve the counting problem in two main steps:\n    a.  **Count Size Permutations:** First, I'll calculate the number of distinct ordered tuples of sizes that can be formed by permuting the given parts `{a_1, ..., a_r}`. If `m_1, m_2, ...` are the counts of identical part sizes (multiplicities), this number is given by `r! / (m_1! * m_2! * ...)`.\n    b.  **Count Partitions for a Fixed Size Order:** For any single ordered tuple of sizes `(b_1, ..., b_r)`, the number of ways to partition `n` labeled points is given by the multinomial coefficient `n! / (b_1! * ... * b_r!)`. Since `(b_1, ..., b_r)` is a permutation of `(a_1, ..., a_r)`, the value of this expression is always `n! / (a_1! * ... * a_r!)`.\n    c.  **Combine for Total:** The total number of partitions is the product of the quantities from the previous two steps.\n    \n    Total Count = `(Number of size permutations) * (Number of partitions for one size order)`\n    Total Count = `(r! / (m_1! * m_2! * ...))` * `(n! / (a_1! * ... * a_r!))`\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that implements this formula. The script will use a concrete example for the partition `a_i` to demonstrate the calculation, as no specific values were provided in the prompt. The script will print the final equation showing all the numbers involved, as requested. For the example, I'll use the partition `a = [3, 2, 2]`.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_tverberg_partitions(a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Tverberg partitions for a set X that always\n    induces the numerical partition given by the parts in list 'a'.\n    \n    The formula is: (r! / (m1! * m2! * ...)) * (n! / (a1! * a2! * ...))\n    where:\n    - n is the total number of points (sum of a_i)\n    - r is the number of parts\n    - a_i are the sizes of the parts\n    - m_i are the multiplicities of the unique part sizes\n    \"\"\"\n    if not a:\n        print(\"The partition list 'a' cannot be empty.\")\n        return\n\n    # For canonical string representation, sort the input list\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n\n    # n is the total number of points, r is the number of parts\n    n = sum(a_sorted)\n    r = len(a_sorted)\n    \n    print(f\"For the given partition of n={n} into r={r} parts: a = {a_sorted}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Calculate factorials of n and r\n    n_fact = math.factorial(n)\n    r_fact = math.factorial(r)\n    \n    # --- Denominators ---\n    # 1.
