    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the topological space X.** We will translate the description of the moduli space into a standard topological construction, specifically a quotient of a Lie group by a discrete subgroup.\n2.  **Use a fibration.** The resulting space $X$ is a fiber bundle. We will identify the fiber and the base space.\n3.  **Apply the Leray-Serre spectral sequence.** This powerful tool relates the homology of the total space ($X$) to the homology of the fiber and the base.\n4.  **Compute the necessary inputs.** We will compute the homology groups of the fiber and the base space.\n5.  **Assemble the result.** We will use the spectral sequence to construct a short exact sequence involving $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ and solve it to find the group structure.\n\nThe following Python script will walk through these mathematical steps to derive the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_homology_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step computation of H_1(X, Z)\n    for the moduli space X of unit-area lattices in R^2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the Space X\")\n    print(\"The moduli space X consists of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.\")\n    print(\"A lattice can be represented by a basis {v1, v2}, which forms the columns of a matrix A in GL_2(R).\")\n    print(\"The 'unit area' condition means the fundamental parallelogram has area 1, so |det(A)| = 1.
