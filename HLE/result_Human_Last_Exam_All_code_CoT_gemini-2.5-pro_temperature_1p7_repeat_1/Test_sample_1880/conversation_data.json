    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a systematic procedure for analyzing quartic polynomials.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, we must confirm that the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We will use Eisenstein's criterion for this.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial will be calculated. The sign of the discriminant and whether it is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ will help classify the Galois group. If the discriminant is a perfect square, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Construct the Resolvent Cubic**: We will form the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with the original quartic. The reducibility of this cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides crucial information about the structure of the Galois group.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: We will check if the resolvent cubic has any rational roots. The number of rational roots determines whether the Galois group is $S_4$, $A_4$, $D_4$, $C_4$, or $V_4$.\n5.  **Determine the Group and its Order**: By combining the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, we can uniquely identify the Galois group and its order.\n\nThe following Python script will execute these steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to get all integer divisors of a number.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(-i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n            divs.add(-(n // i))\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is a depressed quartic of the form x^4 + qx + r.\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n    print(\"The polynomial is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2.\")\n    print(\"Since it is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group G is a transitive subgroup of S4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant (Δ) of the quartic.\")\n    print(\"For a depressed quartic x^4 + qx + r, the discriminant formula is Δ = 256*r^3 -
