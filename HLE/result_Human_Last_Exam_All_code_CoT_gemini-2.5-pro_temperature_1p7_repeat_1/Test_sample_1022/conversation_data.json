    "To solve this problem, we need to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product $T \\times T$, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **State the relevant mathematical formula:** The bounded cohomology of a direct product of groups, such as $T \\times T$, can be computed using a Künneth-type formula. For groups like Thompson's group $T$ that act suitably on the circle, a result by Bucher and Monod provides an isomorphism which, in terms of dimensions, gives the following formula:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^n(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n    In our case, the degree $n$ is 4.\n\n2.  **Provide the required values:** To use this formula, we need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of a single Thompson's group $T$ with real coefficients. These are known results from the mathematical literature:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (This space is generated by the bounded Euler class).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (This space is generated by a class of Godbillon-Vey type).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 4$.\n\n3.  **Implement the calculation in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform the summation for $n=4$. The script will iterate through the pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p+q=4$, multiply the corresponding dimensions, and sum the results. It will print out the full equation, showing each number involved, as requested.\n\nThe pairs $(p, q)$ to consider are $(0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1),$ and $(4, 0)$. The total dimension will be the sum of the products of the dimensions for these pairs.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_cohomology_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group\n    of T x T, where T is Thompson's group.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We want to compute the dimension of H_b^4(T x T).\n    n = 4\n    \n    # We use the known dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T.\n    # dim H_b^k(T; R) for k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n    # For k > 4, the dimension is also 0.\n    dim_Hb_T = {\n        0: 1,\n        1: 0,\n        2: 1,\n        3: 1,\n        4: 0,\n    }\n    \n    print(\"This script computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the Künneth-type formula for bounded cohomology:\")\n    print(f\"dim H_b^{n}(T x T) = sum_{{p+q={n}}} dim H_b^p(T) * dim H_b^q(T)\\n\")\n\n    total_dim = 0\n    equation_terms = []\n    \n    # Iterate through p from 0 to n. q is determined by p + q = n.\n    for p in range(n + 1):\n        q = n - p\n        \n        dim_p = dim_Hb_T.get(p, 0)\n        dim_q = dim_Hb_T.get(q, 0)\n        \n        term = dim_p * dim_q\n        total_dim += term\n        \n        # Store the term as a string for the final equation\n        equation_terms.append(f\"{dim_p}*{dim_q}\")\n        \n    # Build the final equation string from the terms\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_terms)\n    \n    print(\"The final computation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_dim}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_cohomology_dimension()\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
