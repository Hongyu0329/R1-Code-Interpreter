    # --- Setup ---

    # 1. She will guess the value in box k.
    # 2. Her guess will be based on the representative sequence from a "codebook" C.

    # --- Adversary's Turn ---
    # The adversary knows Alice's strategy.
    # Let's assume the all-zero sequence c = (0, 0, ...) is a representative in Alice's codebook.
    # The adversary creates a sequence x that is in the same equivalence class as c,
    # but differs at position k_unopened.

    # Alice finds the representative for her observed sequence x'.
    # Since x' is identical to the representative c, its representative is c itself.
    # This is a key step: find_representative(x') should return c.
    # In our simulation, temp_sequence_x_prime is the same as representative_c.
    determined_representative = representative_c
    
    # Alice makes her guess based on the representative.
