# Description: This script determines the correct Word Avalanche based on the provided rules and description.
# The goal is to find a "True Avalanche" for the description: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
# The avalanche must be based on the word "computer".

# Analysis of the key word "computer"
# Phonetic syllables: com - pu - ter

# Analysis of the correct choice:
correct_choice = 'B'
sentence = 'Computer: "Come poo, tern!"'

# Step 1: Check if it's a True Avalanche.
# The phrase "Come poo, tern!" phonetically repeats the syllables of "computer".
# "Come" sounds like "com".
# "poo" sounds like "pu".
# "tern" sounds like "ter".
# This fits the structural requirement of a True Avalanche.

# Step 2: Check if it fits the description.
# The description is "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
# The phrase "Come poo, tern!" is a command ("Come poo") given to a bird (a "tern").
# This fits the description's theme perfectly.

# Conclusion:
# Choice B is the only option that fulfills both the structural requirement of a True Avalanche
# and the thematic requirement of the description.
