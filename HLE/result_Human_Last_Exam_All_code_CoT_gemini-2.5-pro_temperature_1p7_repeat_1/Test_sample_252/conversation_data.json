    "This is a conceptual question from the field of optical physics, specifically related to a technique called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). The goal of CTIS is to reconstruct a three-dimensional \"data cube\" representing a scene's spatial information (x, y) and spectral information (wavelength, λ) from a single two-dimensional image.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** We want to measure the intensity of light at every point in a 2D scene for every wavelength. This forms a 3D data cube with axes (x, y, λ).\n2.  **Understand the Constraint:** We can only use a single 2D image captured by a camera sensor.\n3.  **Understand the Method:** The method is \"computed tomography.\" Tomography works by taking multiple different \"projections\" (views) of an object and then using an algorithm to reconstruct the original multi-dimensional object. Since we can only take one picture, these multiple projections must be generated optically and captured simultaneously on the single camera sensor.\n4.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits light into its constituent wavelengths, creating a spectrum. This is how we get spectral (λ) information.\n5.  **Analyzing the Scenarios:**\n    *   **One Grating:** If we use a single one-dimensional (1D) grating, it will disperse the light from the scene along one axis on the sensor. This mixes the spectral information with one of the spatial dimensions (e.g., the x-dimension). This creates ambiguity because a change in position along that axis cannot be distinguished from a change in wavelength. It does not generate enough distinct \"views\" for a successful tomographic reconstruction of the full (x, y, λ) data cube.\n    *   **Two Gratings:** If we use two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other (or a single, equivalent 2D grating), the light is dispersed in a 2D pattern. On the sensor, we get a central, undispersed image (the \"0th order\") and multiple spectrally-dispersed images (the \"1st order,\" \"2nd order,\" etc.) appearing at different locations and orientations around the center. These different dispersed images act as the multiple \"projections\" of the (x, y, λ) data cube, viewed from different effective angles. This set of projections contains enough information for a computed tomography algorithm to successfully reconstruct the original 3D data cube.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to generate the necessary projections is two. The Python code below will print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning behind the minimum number of diffraction\n    gratings needed for single-image computed spectral tomography.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This problem relates to Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\")\n    print(\"The goal is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, wavelength) from a single 2D image.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # The number of gratings represents the basis for creating projections.\n    gratings_option_1 = 1\n    gratings_option_2 = 2\n\n    print(f\"Case 1: Using {gratings_option_1} diffraction grating.\")\n    print(\"A single grating disperses light in one direction.
