    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Method\n1.  **Decomposition of the Lie Algebra**: The given 6-dimensional Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be recognized as a **fiber product** of two smaller, more manageable Lie algebras. Let $\\mathfrak{g}_1 = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ with relations $[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4$, and $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_5, e_6\\}$ with relation $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. They are joined over the common 1-dimensional subalgebra $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$.\n    \n2.  **Poincaré Polynomial of a Fiber Product**: The Poincaré polynomial of a fiber product of Lie algebras is given by the formula:\n    $P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P^{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) \\cdot P^{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)}{P^{\\mathfrak{h}}(x)}$\n    This formula applies to the cohomology polynomials. Since the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, it is also unimodular. For unimodular Lie algebras, the homology and cohomology Poincaré polynomials are identical, i.e., $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P^{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Individual Polynomials**:\n    *   For $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathbb{R}$, which is a 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra, the Poincaré polynomial is $P^{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = 1 + x$.\n    *   For the 4D nilpotent algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_1$, its Poincaré polynomial is $P^{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n    *   For the 3D Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_2$, its Poincaré polynomial is $P^{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n\n4.  **Combine the Results**: Substituting the individual polynomials into the formula:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)}{1 + x}$\n\n    These polynomials factor nicely:\n    *   $P^{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2+x^3)$\n    *   $P^{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$\n\n    So, the expression simplifies to:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1+x)(1+x+x^2+x^3) \\cdot (1+x)(1+x+x^2)}{1+x}$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x+x^2)$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We will use a Python script to perform the polynomial multiplication and obtain the final coefficients. The script will multiply the coefficient lists representing these three polynomials and then format the result as a string.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef print_polynomial(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a polynomial from a list of coefficients.\n    Example: [1, 2, 3] -> 1 + 2*x + 3*x**2\n    \"\"\"\n    poly_str = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        if c == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Handle coefficient part\n        if c == 1 and i > 0:\n            coeff_part = \"\"\n        else:\n            coeff_part = str(c)\n\n        if i > 0:\n            # Handle variable part\n            if i == 1:\n                var_part = \"x\"\n            else:\n                var_part = f\"x**{i}\"\n            \n            # Add * if coefficient is present\n            if coeff_part:\n                 term = f\"{coeff_part}*{var_part}\"\n            else:\n                 term = var_part\n        else:\n            term = coeff_part\n\n        poly_str.append(term)\n    \n    # Join with ' + ' and replace '+ -' with '- ' for negative coefficients\n    final_str = \" + \".join(poly_str).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    print(final_str)\n\n# The Poincaré polynomial of g is given by the product of three polynomials:\n# P_g(x) = (1+x) * (1+x+x^2+x^3) * (1+x+x^2)\n\np1_coeffs = [1, 1]  # Represents 1+x\np2_coeffs = [1, 1, 1, 1]  # Represents 1+x+x^2+x^3\np3_coeffs = [1, 1, 1]  # Represents 1+x+x^2\n\n# Multiply the polynomials\n# Result1 = p1 * p2\nresult1_coeffs = np.polymul(p1_coeffs, p2_coeffs)\n\n# Result = Result1 * p3.
