    This function derives and prints the expression for R0f.
    
    R0f is the number of additional trees that catch fire from a single burning tree.
    The derivation follows the fire spread pathway: Tree -> Grass -> Tree.

    The final expression is a product of three terms:
    1. The number of grass areas ignited by a single tree during its burning period.
    2. The probability that an ignited grass area becomes intensely burning (infectious).
    3. The number of trees ignited by a single infectious grass area during its burning period.
