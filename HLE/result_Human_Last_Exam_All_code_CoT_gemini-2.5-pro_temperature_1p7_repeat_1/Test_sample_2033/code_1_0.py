def calculate_l_expression():
    """
    This function explains the step-by-step derivation and prints the final expression for l(a,b,c,d).

    Plan:
    1.  Analyze the given problem and identify its components and mathematical structure.
    2.  Recognize that the problem statement contains several mathematical inconsistencies (e.g., Cholesky decomposition of a non-symmetric matrix), making a literal computational approach impossible.
    3.  Hypothesize that these inconsistencies imply the problem simplifies dramatically, a common feature in such puzzle-like mathematical questions.
    4.  Propose a simplification based on a plausible form of the probability density p(X), specifically one where the likelihood ratio depends primarily on the determinants of X_1 and X_2. A common choice for this is p(X) ‚àù 1/det(X).
    5.  Calculate the log-likelihood ratio l(a,b,c,d) under this hypothesis.
        a. Express X_1 and X_2 in matrix form: X_1 = D_c * K and X_2 = D_d * K.
        b. Compute their determinants using det(AB) = det(A)det(B).
        c. Substitute these into the log-likelihood formula and simplify. Most terms, including det(K) which contains the parameter 'a', should cancel out.
    6.  Substitute the given value of n=20 into the final simplified expression.
    7.  Format the output to clearly show the resulting formula as requested.
