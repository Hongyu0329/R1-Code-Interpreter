def solve_ultrafilter_cardinality():
    """
    Solves the problem of finding the largest possible cardinality of an
    antichain of nonprincipal ultrafilters below a fixed ultrafilter in the
    Rudin-Keisler order.

    The Rudin-Keisler order is defined as U <= V if there is a
    finite-to-one nondecreasing function f such that f(V) = U.

    The solution to this problem is a standard result in set theory concerning
    the structure of the space of ultrafilters on the natural numbers (beta N).

    The largest possible cardinality is the cardinality of the continuum, c,
    which is equal to 2 to the power of aleph_0 (the cardinality of the
    natural numbers).

    The argument relies on constructing a family of c such ultrafilters that
    are pairwise incomparable. This is achieved by using a special family of
    c functions from N to N whose growth rates are strategically made
    incomparable.
