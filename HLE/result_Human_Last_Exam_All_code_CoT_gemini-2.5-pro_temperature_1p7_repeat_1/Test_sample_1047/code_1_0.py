    Analyzes the legal ethics scenario and determines the correct outcome.

    The key points are:
    1.  NC LLP has a duty of confidentiality and loyalty to its former client, Advanced Tech Inc.
    2.  During its previous representation, NC LLP obtained confidential information (financials, contracts) that is directly relevant to the new matter (the acquisition of Advanced Tech Inc.).
    3.  Representing an acquirer (Six Wings Inc.) against a target (Advanced Tech Inc.) when the firm possesses such relevant information constitutes a clear conflict of interest.
    4.  A conflict of this nature can typically only be waived with the informed consent of the prejudiced party, which is the former client, Advanced Tech Inc.
    5.  The problem explicitly states that Advanced Tech Inc. will not provide this consent.
    6.  Therefore, Norman and NC LLP are precluded from representing Six Wings Inc. in this matter.

    This logic directly aligns with answer choice D.
    """
    reasoning = """
    The core issue is a conflict of interest. NC LLP possesses confidential information from its former client, Advanced Tech Inc., that is highly relevant to the proposed acquisition by its current client, Six Wings Inc. This creates a situation where the firm's duty to its current client (to use all available information for their benefit) is in direct conflict with its duty of confidentiality and loyalty to its former client.

    In such cases, the established rule is that the law firm cannot act against the former client without that former client's informed consent. The scenario explicitly states that Advanced Tech Inc. does not consent. Therefore, NC LLP must withdraw from representing Six Wings Inc.
