# Here is the plan to find the three numbers:
# 1. Analyze the three questions (A, B, C) based on literary context.
#    - (A) The Sherlock Holmes allusion points to "The Adventure of the Priory School". The central animal track deception in this story involves creating fake cow tracks. So, A=6.
#    - (B) The theme underscored by this allusion to deception is Kinbote's own flawed scholarly project, which can be described as a form of "mis-education". So, B=3.
#    - (C) Nabokov's most extensive experience with "intricate back-referencing" was his monumental annotated translation of "Eugene Onegin". So, C=7.
# 2. Verify the solution with the mathematical constraint. The sum of the numbers must be a multiple of 8.
#    - The chosen numbers are 6, 3, and 7.
# 3. Calculate the sum and check the condition.
#    - 6 + 3 + 7 = 16.
#    - 16 is a multiple of 8 (16 = 8 * 2), so the condition is met.

# Assign the final numbers to variables
answer_A = 6
answer_B = 3
answer_C = 7

# Print the final numbers for the solution, as requested in the format "number number number"
# The equation is 6 + 3 + 7 = 16
print(answer_A, answer_B, answer_C)

# <<<6 3 7>>>
