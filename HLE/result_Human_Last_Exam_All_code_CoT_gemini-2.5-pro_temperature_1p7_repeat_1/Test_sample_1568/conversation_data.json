    "Of course, I can help you with this. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product**: The request is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$.\n2.  **Relate to a Known Product**: This product starts from $n=3$. It's easier to first evaluate the product starting from $n=1$, which is a known mathematical result, and then adjust for the missing terms. The product from $n=3$ can be expressed as:\n    $$ P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n3.  **Factor the General Term**: The term $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$ can be factored. Using the three cube roots of unity, $1, \\omega=e^{i2\\pi/3}, \\omega^2=e^{i4\\pi/3}$, we can write:\n    $$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n4.  **Use the Gamma Function Identity**: The infinite product from $n=1$ can be evaluated by combining three instances of the Weierstrass product representation for the Gamma function. The resulting identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n    where $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n5.  **Combine and Finalize**: By substituting the result from step 4 into the expression from step 2, we can obtain the final closed form for the product starting from $n=3$.\n6.  **Format the Output**: I will provide a Python script that prints this final formula in a clear and readable format, ensuring all the original numbers ($3$, etc.) are explicitly shown as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef print_infinite_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed-form expression for the infinite product:\n    Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3 / n^3)\n\n    The formula is derived using the infinite product representation of the Gamma function.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the formula\n    numerator = \"1\"\n    \n    # Term for n=1\n    term_n1 = \"(1 - z**3 / 1**3)\"\n    \n    # Term for n=2\n    term_n2 = \"(1 - z**3 / 2**3)\"\n    \n    # Gamma function part from the product starting at n=1\n    # where omega = exp(2*pi*i/3) and omega^2 = exp(4*pi*i/3)\n    gamma_product = \"Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*i/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*i/3))\"\n    \n    # The full denominator is the product of these terms\n    denominator = f\"{term_n1} * {term_n2} * {gamma_product}\"\n\n    # Print the final result in a structured way\n    print(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\n    print()\n    print(f\"  {numerator}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"  ({term_n1}) * ({term_n2}) * {gamma_product}\")\n    print()\n    print(\"Which can be written as:\")\n    print(\"1 / ( \" + denominator + \" )\")\n    print()\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  - z is a complex variable.\")\n    print(\"  - Gamma is the Gamma function.\")\n    print(\"  - exp is the exponential function (e^x).\")\n    print(\"  - pi is the mathematical constant Pi (e.g., math.pi).\")\n    print(\"  - i is the imaginary unit (the square root of -1).\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print_infinite_product_formula()\n```\n<<<1 / ( (1 - z**3/1**3) * (1 - z**3/2**3) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*i/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*i/3)) )>>>"
