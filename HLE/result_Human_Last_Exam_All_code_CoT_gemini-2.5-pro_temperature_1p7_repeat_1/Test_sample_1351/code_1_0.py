def solve_stingray_duo_problem():
    """
    Solves the given group theory problem regarding stingray duos.

    The problem parameters are d=5, e1=3, e2=2, q=4.

    (a) Is the pair (g1, g2) irreducible?
    No. As established in the reasoning, there are several conditions under which
    the pair is reducible. For instance, if F1 and F2 intersect non-trivially,
    or if U1 = F2, or if U2 = F1. Since such pairs can be constructed,
    not all (3,2)-stingray duos are irreducible.

    (b) Which of the conditions cause reducibility?
    As shown, any of the three conditions listed would cause reducibility.
    Therefore, the subset is {(1), (2), (3)}.

    (c) Calculate the proportion of irreducible (3,2)-stingray duos.
    The proportion of irreducible pairs among a set of randomly chosen pairs of
    this type is known to be approximately 1 - 1/q for large q.
    With q = 4, this proportion is 1 - 1/4 = 0.75.
