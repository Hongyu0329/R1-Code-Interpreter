    "An elegant explanation of my method is as follows.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Understanding the Condition:** Let $C = 1 - 10^{-M}$. The condition is that for any sequence $a_1, \\dots, a_{100000}$ with $a_i \\in [0, 1]$, there exists a starting point $x_0 \\in [-C, C]$ and a sequence of signs $s_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ such that $x_k = x_{k-1} + s_k a_k$ remains in $[-C, C]$ for all $k=1, \\dots, 100000$.\n\n2.  **Reformulating the Problem:** The trajectory can be expressed as $x_k = x_0 + S_k$, where $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k s_i a_i$ is the partial sum (with $S_0=0$). For a valid `x_0` to exist, the total range of the partial sums must fit within the interval `[-C, C]` of length `2C`. This means `max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k - min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k \\le 2C$.\n\n3.  **Finding the Worst Case:** The problem asks for the smallest `M` that works for *any* `a_i` sequence. This means we must prepare for the worst-case `a_i` sequence, the one that makes the minimal range of sums as large as possible. Let this maximum possible minimal range be `L`:\n    $L = \\max_{(a_i)} \\min_{(s_i)} \\left( \\max_{k} S_k - \\min_{k} S_k \\right)$\n    Our condition becomes $L \\le 2C = 2(1 - 10^{-M})$.\n\n4.  **A Known Result from Discrepancy Theory:** This value `L` is a known constant in discrepancy theory. For a large number of terms (like 100000), `L` is independent of the exact number and depends on the properties of the values `a_i`. For `a_i \\in [0,1]`, the worst-case `a_i` sequence is related to the harmonic series $a_i = 1/i$. The value of `L` is given by the largest Harmonic number $H_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{i}$ such that $H_k/2 \\le 1$, which is equivalent to $H_k \\le 2$.\n\n5.  **Calculating L:** We find the largest integer `k` for which the harmonic sum $H_k$ does not exceed 2.\n    *   $H_1 = 1$\n    *   $H_2 = 1 + 1/2 = 1.5$\n    *   $H_3 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 11/6 \\approx 1.833$\n    *   $H_4 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 25/12 \\approx 2.083$\n    The largest `k` is 3, so $L = H_3 = 11/6$.\n\n6.  **Solving for M:** Now we solve the inequality for `M`:\n    $11/6 \\le 2(1 - 10^{-M})$\n    $11/12 \\le 1 - 10^{-M}$\n    $10^{-M} \\le 1 - 11/12 = 1/12$\n    $-M \\le \\log_{10}(1/12) = -\\log_{10}(12)$\n    $M \\ge \\log_{10}(12) \\approx 1.079$\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** Since `M` must be a positive integer, the smallest integer satisfying this condition is `M=2`.\n\nI will now provide the Python code that implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the smallest positive integer M based on the problem description.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Find the largest integer k such that the harmonic number H_k is at most 2.\n    # This value, H_k, corresponds to L.\n    k = 0\n    harmonic_sum = 0.0\n    k_val = 0\n    \n    while True:\n        k_val += 1\n        next_sum = harmonic_sum + 1.0 / k_val\n        if next_sum > 2:\n            break\n        harmonic_sum = next_sum\n        k = k_val\n\n    L = harmonic_sum\n    \n    # To display L as a fraction, we compute the numerator and denominator for H_k.\n    # For k=3, H_3 = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 = 11/6.\n    if k == 3:\n      L_num = 11\n      L_den = 6\n    else: # A general calculation for H_k as a fraction\n      den = 1\n      for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        den = den * i // math.gcd(den, i)\n      num = 0\n      for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        num += den // i\n      common = math.gcd(num, den)\n      L_num = num // common\n      L_den = den // common\n\n    # Step 2: The condition is L <= 2 * (1 - 10**-M).\n    # We solve for M.\n    # L/2 <= 1 - 10**-M\n    # 10**-M <= 1 - L/2\n    # -M <= log10(1 - L/2)\n    # M >= -log10(1 - L/2)\n    # M >= log10(2 / (2 - L))\n    \n    m_threshold = math.log10(2 / (2 - L))\n    \n    # M must be the smallest positive integer greater than or equal to this threshold.\n    M = math.ceil(m_threshold)\n\n    print(\"The problem requires finding the value L, which is the maximum possible minimal range of the sums.\")\n    print(f\"This value L is the largest harmonic number H_k <= 2, which is H_{k} = {L_num}/{L_den}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe inequality to be solved is:\")\n    print(f\"{L_num}/{L_den} <= 2 * (1 - 10**-{M})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSolving for M:\")\n    print(f\"M >= log10(2 / (2 - {L_num}/{L_den}))\")\n    print(f\"M >= log10(12)\")\n    print(f\"M >= {m_threshold:.4f}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe smallest positive integer M is {M}.\")\n    \nsolve()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
