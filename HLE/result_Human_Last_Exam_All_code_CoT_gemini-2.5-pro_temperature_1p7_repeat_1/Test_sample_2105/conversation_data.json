    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule:** The starting material is di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide. The major reduction product is formed by breaking the disulfide (S-S) bond and adding hydrogen, which results in two identical molecules of **perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₂S)**. The calculation will be performed on a single molecule of this product.\n2.  **Represent the Molecule:** I will use the `rdkit` library to create a molecular structure from its SMILES representation. Crucially, as requested, I will add all hydrogen atoms to the structure to ensure they are included in the graph. The resulting molecule will be converted to a `networkx` graph, where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.\n3.  **Calculate All-Pairs Shortest Paths:** The foundation for both the Wiener and Szeged indices is the matrix of shortest path distances between all pairs of atoms (nodes) in the molecular graph. I will use the `networkx` library to compute this.\n4.  **Calculate Wiener Index (W):** I will iterate through all unique pairs of atoms in the graph, sum their shortest path distances, and this sum will be the Wiener index.\n5.  **Calculate Szeged Index (Sz):** I will iterate through every bond (edge) in the graph. For each bond connecting atoms `u` and `v`, I will calculate `n_u` (the number of atoms closer to `u` than to `v`) and `n_v` (the number of atoms closer to `v` than to `u`). The Szeged index is the sum of the products (`n_u` * `n_v`) over all bonds.\n6.  **Compute the Ratio:** Finally, I will divide the calculated Szeged index by the Wiener index and print the full equation and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python script to execute this plan. You will need to have the `rdkit` and `networkx` libraries installed (`pip install rdkit networkx`).\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef calculate_molecular_indices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Wiener and Szeged indices for perylene-3-thiol,\n    including hydrogen atoms, and computes their ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
