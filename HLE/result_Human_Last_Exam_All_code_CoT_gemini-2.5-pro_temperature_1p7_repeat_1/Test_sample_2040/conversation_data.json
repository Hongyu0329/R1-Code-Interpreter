    "Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a nonlinear optical process that is crucial for generating entangled photon pairs, a key resource in quantum computing and quantum communication. My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The primary requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is that it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  **Relate the Principle to Material Properties:** A material can only have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal structure lacks a center of inversion (i.e., it is non-centrosymmetric). In centrosymmetric materials, χ⁽²⁾ is always zero, and thus SPDC cannot occur.\n3.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** I will investigate the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets. Borophene can exist in many different atomic arrangements, known as phases or allotropes.\n4.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** The possibility of SPDC in boron nanosheets will depend entirely on whether a specific phase is centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric. I will also consider real-world factors like structural defects or strain, which can break the ideal symmetry of a material.\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** I will create a Python script that codifies this logic. The script will not perform a physical simulation but will serve as a structured explanation, checking different conditions (e.g., different phases, presence of defects) to determine the potential for SPDC and printing the reasoning at each step, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that logically walks through the conditions required for SPDC in boron nanosheets.\n\n```python\ndef check_spdc_potential_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential for free-standing boron nanosheets to exhibit\n    Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) based on physical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis of SPDC Potential in Boron Nanosheets ---\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Explain the fundamental requirement for SPDC ---\n    print(\"\\n[Step 1: The Core Physics Principle]\")\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"A material must have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (chi_2) to exhibit SPDC.\")\n    requirement_for_chi_2 = \"The material's crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (be non-centrosymmetric).\"\n    print(f\"The key requirement for a non-zero chi_2 is: {requirement_for_chi_2}\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze the structure of Boron Nanosheets ---\n    print(\"\\n[Step 2: Symmetry of Boron Nanosheet Phases]\")\n    print(\"Boron nanosheets (borophene) can exist in multiple atomic configurations (phases).\")\n    print(\"The symmetry, and thus the potential for SPDC, depends on the specific phase.\")\n\n    # Illustrative examples of borophene phases and their symmetry\n    centrosymmetric_phases = [\"beta_12 (Pmmn)\", \"chi_3 (Cmmm)\"]\n    non_centrosymmetric_phases = [\"striped phase\", \"8-Pmmn phase\"]\n\n    print(f\"\\nExample Centrosymmetric Phases: {', '.join(centrosymmetric_phases)}\")\n    print(\"For these phases, the ideal crystal structure has a center of inversion.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, their intrinsic chi_2 is 0.
