    This function determines the minimal resources needed to classically simulate
    the correlations of a quantum singlet state.

    The problem asks for the minimal resources, in terms of non-signaling PR-Boxes
    and classical communication, for a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model to
    perfectly simulate the results of any POVM measurements on a singlet state.

    This is a well-established result in quantum information theory. A perfect
    simulation of the singlet state's correlations for all possible measurements
    is achievable if the LHV model is supplemented with a certain amount of
    a "non-local" resource.

    The theory shows there are two equivalent minimal resource options.
