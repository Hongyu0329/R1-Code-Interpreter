# Based on the scientific description of the Irritator challengeri skull,
# we can identify the number of depressions in its lacrimal recess.

# Number of promaxillary fenestrae within the recess
promaxillary_fenestra = 1

# Number of other distinct depressions within the recess
additional_depression = 1

# Calculate the total number of depressions
total_depressions = promaxillary_fenestra + additional_depression

# The final equation demonstrates the components that make up the total.
print(f"The lacrimal recess contains {promaxillary_fenestra} (promaxillary fenestra) + {additional_depression} (other distinct depression) = {total_depressions} depressions in total.")
