    "To determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*, we must consult paleontological research papers that describe its skull anatomy. The primary source for the skull is the 2002 paper by Sues et al., \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\".\n\nAccording to this research, the lacrimal recess (a depression on the lacrimal bone) contains two distinct smaller depressions or openings within it:\n1.  A large promaxillary fenestra.\n2.  A second, smaller, unnamed subcircular fenestra/depression located posterior to the first one.\n\nTherefore, the total number of depressions is 2.\n\nI will write a simple Python script to represent this information and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Based on the scientific description of the Irritator challengeri skull,\n# we can identify the number of depressions in its lacrimal recess.\n\n# Number of promaxillary fenestrae within the recess\npromaxillary_fenestra = 1\n\n# Number of other distinct depressions within the recess\nadditional_depression = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions\ntotal_depressions = promaxillary_fenestra + additional_depression\n\n# The final equation demonstrates the components that make up the total.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess contains {promaxillary_fenestra} (promaxillary fenestra) + {additional_depression} (other distinct depression) = {total_depressions} depressions in total.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
