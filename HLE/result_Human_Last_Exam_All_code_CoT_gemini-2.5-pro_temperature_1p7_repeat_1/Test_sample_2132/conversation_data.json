    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity, we first need to identify the product of the reaction and then apply the complexity formula.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone in the presence of a base (like hydroxide) results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring, and the ketone group is converted into a carboxylic acid. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n2.  **Define the Böttcher Molecular Complexity (MCI) formula:**\n    MCI = N_b * (N_at / N_b_eff)\n    *   `N_at`: The total number of atoms, excluding hydrogen.\n    *   `N_b`: The number of bonds, excluding bonds to hydrogen.\n    *   `N_b_eff`: The sum of the bond orders of all bonds, excluding bonds to hydrogen.\n3.  **Calculate the parameters for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid:**\n    *   Count the non-hydrogen atoms (`N_at`).\n    *   Count the bonds between these non-hydrogen atoms (`N_b`).\n    *   Sum the bond orders for these bonds (`N_b_eff`).\n4.  **Calculate the MCI:** Substitute the calculated values into the formula.\n5.  **Generate Python code:** Write a script to perform these calculations and print the result, explaining each step as we go. The code will explicitly show the numbers used in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bottcher_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the\n    Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the product and explain the formula\n    print(\"The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone yields cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"The structure is a 5-membered carbon ring attached to a carboxyl group (-COOH).\")\n    print(\"\\nWe will use the Böttcher Molecular Complexity (MCI) formula:\")\n    print(\"MCI = N_b * (N_at / N_b_eff)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the parameters for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n    # N_at: Number of non-hydrogen atoms (6 Carbons, 2 Oxygens)\n    n_at = 6 + 2\n    print(f\"1.
