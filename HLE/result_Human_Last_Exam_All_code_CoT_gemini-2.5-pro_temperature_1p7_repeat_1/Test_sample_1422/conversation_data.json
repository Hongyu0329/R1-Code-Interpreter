    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** I will start with the fundamental topological formula for Feynman diagrams that connects the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), vertices (V), and external lines (E). This formula is `L = I - V + 1`.\n2.  **Incorporate the interaction type:** I will use a second formula that relates the number of vertices and lines based on the type of interaction. For a theory with an n-point interaction vertex (e.g., n=3 for a $\\phi^3$ theory, n=4 for a $\\phi^4$ theory), the relationship is `n * V = 2 * I + E`.\n3.  **Combine the formulas:** By solving the second equation for I and substituting it into the first, I will derive a single equation for the number of vertices (V) in terms of L, E, and n. The resulting formula will be `V = (2L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)`.\n4.  **Apply problem constraints:** The problem specifies `L=2` (two loops). To find the *minimum* number of vertices, I will use the minimum possible number of external lines, which is `E=0` (this corresponds to a vacuum diagram).\n5.  **Solve for V:** With `L=2` and `E=0`, the formula simplifies to `V = 2 / (n - 2)`.\n6.  **Find the minimum integer solution:** I will then test this simplified formula for the simplest possible interaction types (n=3, n=4) to find the smallest possible *integer* value for V. This will give the minimum number of vertices required.\n7.  **Generate the code:** The Python script will implement this step-by-step calculation, printing out the formulas and the results for each case to clearly explain how the final answer is reached.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop\n    Feynman diagram for a scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
