    This function explains the proof for a set theory problem by counterexample.

    Let S be a collection of infinite subsets of omega of cardinality less than 2^omega. 
    If the continuum hypothesis is true, does there always exist x, an infinite subset of omega, 
    such that for every s in S, the intersection of x and s is finite?
