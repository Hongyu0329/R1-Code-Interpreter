# The reasoning establishes that the maximum possible value for the expression is 0.
# The calculation simplifies to 0 based on the relationship lambda >= mu, which holds for all regular cardinals.
# Even though the relationship is more complex for singular cardinals, the problem's framing
# suggests a single numerical answer, for which 0 is the only viable candidate.
# The final equation is essentially lambda - lambda = 0.
result = 0
