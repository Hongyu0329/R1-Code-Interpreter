    "In the framework of finite-temperature field theory, we describe a system using a functional integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action. For a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, this is a great way to understand the system's thermodynamics. I will now explain the steps to find the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` and then provide a Python script using the `sympy` library to construct this expression symbolically.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Start with the Partition Function:** The partition function `Z` is given by the functional integral `Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`, where `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action for the scalar field.\n2.  **Define the Euclidean Action:** For a free, neutral scalar field `ϕ` with mass `m`, the Euclidean action `S_E` in a 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time `τ` and spatial coordinates `x, y, z`) is:\n    `S_E[ϕ] = ∫ dτ d³x [ ½(∂_μ ϕ)(∂^μ ϕ) + ½m²ϕ² ]`\n    where `∂_μ ∂^μ` is the sum of squared partial derivatives with respect to all four coordinates.\n3.  **Relate Action to the Inner Product:** The action is quadratic in the field `ϕ`, which allows us to write it in a compact form analogous to a matrix product. After performing an integration by parts (and assuming boundary terms vanish due to periodicity and fields vanishing at infinity), the action becomes:\n    `S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫ dτ d³x ϕ(x) [-∂² + m²] ϕ(x)`\n    Here, `∂²` is the 4D Laplacian operator `(∂_τ² + ∇²)`.\n4.  **Identify the Operator and Inner Product:** This form matches the general expression `S_E = ½ (ϕ, D ϕ)`. The inner product `(f, g)` is defined as `∫ f(x)g(x) d⁴x_E`. By comparing the two forms, we can identify the operator `D` as `D = -∂² + m²`, which is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. The inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is therefore the integral `∫ ϕ(x) [-∂² + m²] ϕ(x) d⁴x_E`, which is exactly equal to `2 * S_E[ϕ]`.\n5.  **Code the Solution:** I will now use Python's `sympy` library to symbolically define the field `ϕ`, the operator `D`, and construct the expression for the integrand of `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`, which is `ϕ * (Dϕ)`. The code will print this result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_scalar_field_inner_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses sympy to symbolically derive the integrand of the\n    inner product (phi, D_phi) for a neutral scalar field in\n    finite-temperature field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
