    "In a dance scene, the hierarchy of sound is determined by what element is driving the action and creating the mood. Here's the step-by-step thinking process for ranking them:\n\n1.  **Music:** This is almost always the most important element. The choreography, rhythm, and emotion of the dance are directly tied to the music. It's the foundation upon which the scene is built.\n2.  **Sound Effects (SFX):** These add texture and realism to the scene. The sound of tap shoes, the swish of a dress, or footsteps on the floor ground the dance in a physical space. While important for immersion, they are secondary to the music that dictates the performance itself.\n3.  **Speech:** In a scene focused on dancing, speech or dialogue is typically the least important element. It is often omitted entirely during the main dance sequence to avoid distracting from the music and visual performance. If present, it's usually used before or after the dance or as a minimal voiceover.\n\nTherefore, the order of importance is: Music, Sound Effects, Speech.\n\nThe following Python code will arrange these elements into the correct hierarchy and print the result.\n\n```python\n# The sound elements to be ranked\nsound_elements = {\n    'Music': 1,\n    'Sound Effects': 2,\n    'Speech': 3\n}\n\n# Sort the elements based on their rank (value)\nranked_elements = sorted(sound_elements.keys(), key=lambda item: sound_elements[item])\n\n# Join the sorted list into a comma-separated string for display\nfinal_ranking = \", \".join(ranked_elements)\n\n# Print the final hierarchical order\nprint(final_ranking)\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
