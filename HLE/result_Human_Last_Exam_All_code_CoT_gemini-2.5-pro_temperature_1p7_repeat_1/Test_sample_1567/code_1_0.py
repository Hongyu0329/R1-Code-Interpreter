    The problem asks for the maximal integer k such that for any choice of k d-dimensional (d>=3) probability measures {ν₁,...,νₖ} with mean 0, a 'controlled random walk' cannot be guaranteed to return to the origin.

    Step 1: Interpreting the question
    Let's formalize the question. To "guarantee (with probability 1) that the walk will return to the origin" means there exists a control strategy that makes the walk recurrent.
    The question asks for the maximal k for which this is *not* possible, for *any* given set of k measures.
    This means we are looking for the maximal k such that for ANY set of measures {ν₁,...,νₖ}, ALL possible control strategies lead to a transient walk (one that only returns to the origin a finite number of times).

    Step 2: Analyzing the case k=1
    If k=1, there is only one measure ν₁. The controller has no choice at any step; they must always choose ν₁.
    The 'controlled' random walk is therefore a standard random walk where each step is an independent and identically distributed random variable drawn from ν₁.
    The problem states that the measure has a mean of 0 and the dimension d is 3 or greater.
    By a fundamental result in random walk theory (Pólya's recurrence theorem), a simple symmetric random walk on a lattice is transient for d ≥ 3. This result extends to more general random walks with mean 0 and finite variance (which is guaranteed by the bounded support condition).
    Therefore, for k=1, the walk is always transient. The condition holds.

    Step 3: Analyzing the case k ≥ 2
    Now, consider k=2. Do all pairs of measures {ν₁, ν₂} lead to a transient walk, regardless of the control strategy?
    The answer is no. A key result in this area is from a paper by I. Benjamini, G. Kozma, Y. Peres, and B. Tóth (2012). They proved that for d ≥ 3, there exists a specific pair of zero-mean, finitely supported measures such that a controller can employ a strategy to make the walk recurrent.
    The existence of even one such pair of measures is a counterexample to the statement "for ANY choice of measures, the walk is always transient".
    Therefore, the condition from the question does not hold for k=2.

    Step 4: Conclusion for k > 2
    If the condition fails for k=2, it must also fail for any k > 2. To show this, one can construct a set of k measures by taking the special recurrent-enabling pair from the paper and adding any k-2 other valid measures. The controller can simply choose to ignore these k-2 additional measures and follow the recurrence strategy using only the first two. This makes the walk recurrent.
    Thus, for any k ≥ 2, we cannot claim that *any* set of k measures will force a transient walk.

    Step 5: Final Result
    The condition holds for k=1 but fails for k=2 and all larger k. The maximal value of k for which the condition holds is therefore 1.
