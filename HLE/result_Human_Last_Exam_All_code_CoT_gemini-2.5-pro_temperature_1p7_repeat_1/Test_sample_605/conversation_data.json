    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a quasi-smooth Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ defined as a hypersurface of degree $d$ in a weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$ is given by the formula:\n    $CN(X) = \\frac{d^2}{12 \\prod_{i=1}^5 w_i} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i - d \\right) + \\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{w_i^2+1}{w_i}$\n\n2.  **Simplify the Formula for a Calabi-Yau Hypersurface:** The defining property of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface is that its degree $d$ is equal to the sum of the weights of the ambient projective space, i.e., $d = \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i$. This causes the term $(\\sum w_i - d)$ to become zero, which eliminates the entire first part of the formula. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n    $CN(X) = \\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{w_i^2+1}{w_i}$\n\n3.  **Extract Data and Verify:**\n    *   The weights are given as $W = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n    *   The degree $d$ must equal the sum of the weights: $d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   The provided polynomial is used to confirm the manifold type. A weighted homogeneous polynomial must have all its monomials of the same weighted degree. While there appears to be a typo in the second monomial ($z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has degree 224, not 225), we will proceed under the standard assumption that this defines a Calabi-Yau hypersurface of degree 225, as the specific coefficients of the polynomial do not affect the invariant's value.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** We will substitute the weights into the simplified formula and compute the result using a Python script. The script will display the calculation process, showing how each number contributes to the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space P(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree 'd' of the defining polynomial\n    # is equal to the sum of the weights.\n    d = sum(weights)\n\n    # The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau threefold simplifies to:\n    # CN(X) = (1/12) * Σ((w_i^2 + 1) / w_i) for i=1 to 5.\n    # The first term of the general formula becomes zero because (Σw_i - d) = 0.\n\n    # We calculate the sum part of the formula.\n    sum_of_terms = 0\n    for w in weights:\n        term = (w**2 + 1) / w\n        sum_of_terms += term\n        \n    # The invariant is the sum divided by 12.\n    cn_invariant = sum_of_terms / 12\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface is calculated using a simplified formula:\")\n    print(\"CN(X) = (1/12) * Σ((w_i^2 + 1) / w_i)\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the weights W = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75), the calculation is as follows:\")\n\n    # Construct and print the full equation with numerical values\n    equation_str = \"CN(X) = 1/12 * ( \"\n    terms_list = []\n    for w in weights:\n        terms_list.append(f\"({w}^2 + 1)/{w}\")\n    equation_str += \" + \".join(terms_list)\n    equation_str += f\" ) = {cn_invariant}\"\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(equation_str)\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom()\n```\n<<<18.761139900056155>>>"
