    "To find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ and are left coprime. Two matrices are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Set up the governing equation**: The equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ relates the unknown polynomial entries of $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ to the known rational functions in $H(s)$.\n2.  **Establish conditions for polynomial solutions**: From the main equation, we can derive conditions that the entries of $D(s)$ must satisfy for the resulting entries of $N(s)$ to be polynomials. Specifically, we'll ensure that any denominators arising from the multiplication $D(s)H(s)$ are cancelled out. This gives us a set of constraints.\n3.  **Find basis vectors**: We will find a set of two linearly independent polynomial vectors that satisfy these constraints. Each of these solution vectors will form a row of the combined matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$.\n4.  **Construct D(s) and N(s)**: With the two rows determined, we can construct the final matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n5.  **Code the solution**: I will implement these steps in Python using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform the calculations and present the final result.\n\nThe following Python code carries out this plan to compute the factorization.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) \n    for the transfer function:\n    H(s) = [[(s-1)/(s+1), 1],\n            [2/(s^2-1),   0]]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variable and transfer function\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n    \n    # We are looking for D(s) and N(s) such that D(s)H(s) = N(s).\n    # Let a generic row of D(s) be [d1(s), d2(s)].\n    # The corresponding row of N(s) will be [n1(s), n2(s)].\n    # The equations are:\n    # n1 = d1 * (s-1)/(s+1) + d2 * 2/(s**2-1)\n    # n2 = d1 * 1 + d2 * 0 = d1\n    \n    # Step 2: Establish conditions for polynomial solutions\n    # For N(s) to be a polynomial matrix, we require n1 and n2 to be polynomials.\n    # For n2 to be a polynomial, d1 must be a polynomial.\n    # Let's rewrite the equation for n1 with a common denominator (s^2 - 1):\n    # n1 = (d1 * (s-1)**2 + 2*d2) / (s**2 - 1)\n    # For n1 to be a polynomial, the numerator must be divisible by (s^2 - 1).\n    # This means the numerator must be zero at the roots of the denominator, s=1 and s=-1.\n    # Let Num(s) = d1(s)*(s-1)**2 + 2*d2(s).\n    # Condition at s=1: Num(1) = d1(1)*(0) + 2*d2(1) = 0  =>  d2(1) = 0.\n    # Condition at s=-1: Num(-1) = d1(-1)*(-2)**2 + 2*d2(-1) = 0  =>  4*d1(-1) + 2*d2(-1) = 0  =>  2*d1(-1) + d2(-1) = 0.\n\n    # Step 3: Find two linearly independent pairs of polynomials (d1, d2) that satisfy these conditions.\n    \n    # First solution pair for the first row of D(s)\n    # Let's choose a simple polynomial for d11(s), e.g., d11(s) = 1.\n    # The conditions on d12(s) become:\n    # d12(1) = 0\n    # 2*d11(-1) + d12(-1) = 2*(1) + d12(-1) = 0  =>  d12(-1) = -2.\n    # A simple linear polynomial d12(s) = a*s + b can be found:\n    # a + b = 0\n    # -a + b = -2\n    # Solving this system gives b = -1 and a = 1.
