    This function provides a computational illustration for the theoretical
    problem about the distribution of points on an algebraic curve.

    The problem asks for the asymptotic ratio of two sets of points on a curve C:
    1. Numerator: Irreducible degree d points whose associated divisor lies in a specific linear system (g^r_d).
    2. Denominator: All irreducible degree d points on C.

    The correct answer, based on known theorems in arithmetic geometry, is that this ratio approaches 1/|G|, where G is the Galois (or monodromy) group of the map to projective space defined by the g^r_d.

    This script will illustrate this for a classic example.
