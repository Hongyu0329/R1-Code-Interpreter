    "To find an analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can use the method of asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Behavior:** For small $\\epsilon > 0$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$ becomes very large where the function $f(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$ is close to zero. In the integration interval $[0, 15]$, $f(x)$ is zero only at $x=0$. Therefore, the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n2.  **Approximate the Integrand:** Near $x=0$, the term with the lowest power of $x$ dominates the function $f(x)$. So, we can approximate $f(x) \\approx 9x^5$. This simplifies the integral to $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n3.  **Simplify the Integral:** For small $\\epsilon$, the value of the integral is primarily determined by the singularity at $x=0$. The contribution from the upper part of the integration range is much smaller. This allows us to extend the upper limit of integration from 15 to infinity without significantly affecting the leading-order result. This gives $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n4.  **Calculate the Approximate Integral:** This simplified integral can be solved analytically. By performing a variable substitution, it can be related to the well-known Beta function, which has a closed-form expression. The scaling with $\\epsilon$ can be found using the substitution $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u$. The final result will have the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{-a}$.\n5.  **Develop Python Code:** I will provide a Python script to calculate the numerical values of the exponent `a` and the coefficient `C` and print the resulting analytical formula.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to derive the coefficients of the approximate formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficients for the asymptotic approximation of the integral I(epsilon).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The integral is I(epsilon) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1/(epsilon + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8) dx.\n    # For small x, the denominator is dominated by epsilon + b*x^n.\n    b = 9.0\n    n = 5.0\n\n    # The approximation has the form I(epsilon) ~ C * epsilon^(-a).\n    # The exponent 'a' is determined by the power 'n'.\n    # a = (n-1)/n\n    a = (n - 1.0) / n\n\n    # The coefficient C is given by the formula C = (b**(-1/n) / n) * (pi / sin(pi/n)).\n    # We will calculate each component of C.\n    pi_val = np.pi\n    sin_val = np.sin(pi_val / n)\n    b_pow_val = b**(-1.0 / n)\n    \n    # Calculate C\n    C = (b_pow_val / n) * (pi_val / sin_val)\n\n    print(\"The analytical approximation for I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) approx C * epsilon**(-a)\")\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Determine the exponent 'a'\")\n    print(f\"The dominant term in the denominator near x=0 is f(x) approx b*x**n, where b={b} and n={n}.\")\n    print(f\"The exponent 'a' is calculated as a = (n - 1) / n.\")\n    print(f\"a = ({n} - 1.0) / {n}\")\n    print(f\"a = {a}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the coefficient C\")\n    print(\"The formula for C is: C = (b**(-1/n) / n) * (pi / sin(pi/n))\")\n    print(\"\\nIntermediate values:\")\n    print(f\"  b = {b}\")\n    print(f\"  n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"  pi = {pi_val}\")\n    print(f\"  sin(pi/n) = sin(pi/{n}) = {sin_val}\")\n    print(f\"  b**(-1/n) = {b}**(-1.0/{n}) = {b_pow_val}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation for C:\")\n    print(f\"C = ({b_pow_val} / {n}) * ({pi_val} / {sin_val})\")\n    print(f\"C = {C}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n    print(\"The derived analytical formula is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) approx {C} * epsilon**(-{a})\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<0.6888402517651037>>>"
