No, the local magnetic field at L1 is not radial due to the Parker spiral. The use of a radial-perpendicular coordinate system is a frequently used simplification, but as demonstrated, a more rigorous analysis requires transforming to a coordinate system aligned with the local magnetic field to accurately determine wave properties like helicity.
