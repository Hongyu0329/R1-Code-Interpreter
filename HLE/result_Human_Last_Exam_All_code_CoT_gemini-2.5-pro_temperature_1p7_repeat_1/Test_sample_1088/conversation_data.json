    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atoms involved. The notation **6-311G\\*\\*** provides the recipe for constructing the basis set for any given atom.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Notation (6-311G\\*\\*)**:\n    *   **For non-Hydrogen atoms (e.g., Carbon, Oxygen):**\n        *   `6-`: The core electrons (e.g., 1s orbital of Carbon) are described by a single function contracted from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   `-311G`: The valence electrons (e.g., 2s and 2p orbitals of Carbon) are described by three functions (a triple-split basis). These are contracted from **3**, **1**, and **1** primitive Gaussians respectively. For efficiency, the s and p valence orbitals share the same primitive exponents. So, this part contributes `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives.\n        *   `*` (the first asterisk): Adds a set of d-type polarization functions to each non-Hydrogen atom. This set is built from a single **1** primitive Gaussian.\n        *   **Total for a non-Hydrogen atom:** 6 (core) + 5 (valence) + 1 (polarization) = **12** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n        *   Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the `6-` part does not apply.\n        *   `-311G`: The valence 1s orbital is described by three functions, contracted from **3**, **1**, and **1** primitive Gaussians. This gives a total of `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives.\n        *   `*` (the second asterisk): Adds a set of p-type polarization functions to each Hydrogen atom. This set is built from a single **1** primitive Gaussian.\n        *   **Total for a Hydrogen atom:** 5 (valence) + 1 (polarization) = **6** primitive Gaussians.\n\nTo provide a concrete answer, I will write a Python script to calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for a methane molecule (CHâ‚„), which contains both Carbon (a non-Hydrogen atom) and Hydrogen atoms, thereby demonstrating the full meaning of the **6-311G\\*\\*** basis set.\n\n```python\n# The 6-311G** basis set's primitive count depends on the atom.\n# Let's calculate the total for a common molecule, methane (CH4).\n\n# Define the number of atoms in methane\nnum_carbon_atoms = 1\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 4\n\n# --- Calculation for one Carbon (non-Hydrogen) atom ---\n# Core primitives from the \"6-\" part\nc_core_primitives = 6\n# Valence primitives from the \"-311\" part (3+1+1)\nc_valence_primitives = 3 + 1 + 1\n# Polarization primitives from the first \"*\" (d-functions)\nc_polarization_primitives = 1\n# Total for one Carbon atom\nc_total = c_core_primitives + c_valence_primitives + c_polarization_primitives\n\n# --- Calculation for one Hydrogen atom ---\n# Core primitives (Hydrogen has no core)\nh_core_primitives = 0\n# Valence primitives from the \"-311\" part (3+1+1)\nh_valence_primitives = 3 + 1 + 1\n# Polarization primitives from the second \"*\" (p-functions)\nh_polarization_primitives = 1\n# Total for one Hydrogen atom\nh_total = h_core_primitives + h_valence_primitives + h_polarization_primitives\n\n# --- Calculate the total for the methane (CH4) molecule ---\ntotal_molecule_primitives = (num_carbon_atoms * c_total) + (num_hydrogen_atoms * h_total)\n\n# --- Print the final breakdown and equation ---\nprint(\"Calculation for a Methane (CH4) molecule with the 6-311G** basis set:\\n\")\nprint(f\"Primitives per Carbon atom = {c_core_primitives} (core) + {c_valence_primitives} (valence) + {c_polarization_primitives} (polarization) = {c_total}\")\nprint(f\"Primitives per Hydrogen atom = {h_core_primitives} (core) + {h_valence_primitives} (valence) + {h_polarization_primitives} (polarization) = {h_total}\\n\")\nprint(\"Total primitive Gaussians for CH4:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} * {c_total}) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} * {h_total}) = {total_molecule_primitives}\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
