    # Statement I: Twitching motility is typically initiated by stab inoculation.

    # allows the bacteria to move along the agar-plastic interface using type IV pili.

    # to achieve an appropriate depth.

    # including glycerol, to fuel processes like swarming motility.

    # iron-dependent. Metal chelators sequester iron, thus inhibiting swarming.

    # pyoverdine. Concentrating the cells also concentrates these pigments, leading to a strong color.
