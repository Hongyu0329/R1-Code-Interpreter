    Analyzes statements about the junction tree algorithm and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis is as follows:
    A: False. The junction tree algorithm is for exact inference. For many general graphs (especially those with high treewidth), approximate inference methods are computationally more efficient.
    B: False. The algorithm is highly sensitive, not resilient, to high treewidth. High treewidth is its main bottleneck.
    C: True. The nodes of a junction tree are clusters of variables (cliques), and the algorithm passes messages that represent joint distributions (potentials) over these variables.
    D: False. This statement is based on the false premise that the algorithm is resilient to high treewidth.
    E: True. High treewidth leads to large cliques in the junction tree. The memory and computation required for the potential tables of these large cliques grow exponentially, making the algorithm impractical.
    F: False. This is identical to statement D and is false for the same reason.
    G: True. The reason the algorithm is NOT resilient to high treewidth is precisely because it must compute and store joint distributions for the variables in the cliques. High treewidth forces these cliques to be large, leading to an exponential blow-up.
    H: False. The computational cost grows exponentially, not linearly, with the number of variables in the largest clique.
    I: True. The computational complexity is exponential in the treewidth of the graph, which corresponds to the size of the largest clique. If the clique size increases linearly, the cost (and thus lack of efficiency) grows exponentially.
    J: False. The efficiency is heavily dependent on the clique size.
    L: True. This is a correct (though slightly complex) statement of the Running Intersection Property. If a variable exists in a set of cliques, it must exist in all cliques on the paths connecting them.

    Based on the analysis, the correct statements are C, E, G, I, and L.
