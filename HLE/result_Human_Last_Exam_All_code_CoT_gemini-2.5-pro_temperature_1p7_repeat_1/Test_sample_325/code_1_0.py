# Step 1: Verify that the curve is non-degenerate.
# A curve gamma(t) in R^d is non-degenerate if its first d derivatives are
# linearly independent. For d=3, we check the first three derivatives.
# Let's define the curve symbolically.
t = sympy.Symbol('t')
gamma = sympy.Matrix([sympy.cos(t), sympy.sin(t), t])

# Calculate the first three derivatives.
gamma_p1 = sympy.diff(gamma, t)
gamma_p2 = sympy.diff(gamma_p1, t)
gamma_p3 = sympy.diff(gamma_p2, t)

# Form the matrix of the derivative vectors.
M = sympy.Matrix.hstack(gamma_p1, gamma_p2, gamma_p3).T

# Calculate the determinant.
det_M = M.det()
# The determinant is det_M = sin(t)*(sin(t)**2 + cos(t)**2) = sin(t) for sympy's
# default derivative matrix construction, or 1 if arranged differently.
# Let's compute it explicitly:
# gamma_p1 = [-sin(t), cos(t), 1]
# gamma_p2 = [-cos(t), -sin(t), 0]
# gamma_p3 = [sin(t), -cos(t), 0]
# det = 1 * ((-cos(t)) * (-cos(t)) - (-sin(t)) * sin(t)) = cos(t)**2 + sin(t)**2 = 1.
# Since the determinant is 1 (non-zero), the curve is non-degenerate.
print("The curve is non-degenerate because the determinant of its first three derivatives is 1.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 2: Apply the formula for the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent.
# The formula for a non-degenerate curve in R^d is p = d*(d+1)/2.
# Here, the dimension d is 3.
d = 3

# Step 3: Calculate and print the result.
numerator = d * (d + 1)
denominator = 2
exponent = numerator / denominator

print(f"The dimension of the space is d = {d}.")
print("The formula for the sharp exponent is p = d * (d + 1) / 2.")
print("Substituting d = 3 into the formula gives:")
print(f"p = {d} * ({d} + 1) / {denominator} = {numerator} / {denominator} = {int(exponent)}")
