    "To determine the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we rely on a major result in harmonic analysis by Bourgain and Demeter. Their theorem provides a formula for the sharp exponent for so-called \"non-degenerate\" curves.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish that the curve $\\gamma(t)$ is non-degenerate. A curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is non-degenerate if its first $d$ derivatives are linearly independent. For our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this means checking the linear independence of $\\gamma'(t)$, $\\gamma''(t)$, and $\\gamma'''(t)$. This is typically done by showing that the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is non-zero.\n2.  Second, once the curve is shown to be non-degenerate, I will apply the Bourgain-Demeter formula for the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent, which is $p = \\frac{d(d+1)}{2}$.\n3.  Finally, I will use a Python script to calculate this value for $d=3$ and print the result, showing the numbers used in the formula as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Step 1: Verify that the curve is non-degenerate.\n# A curve gamma(t) in R^d is non-degenerate if its first d derivatives are\n# linearly independent.
