  # The problem asks for the cardinalities of S/A, B/S, and H_1(B/A, Q).

  # Step 1: Cardinality of S/A
  # A is the initial object in the category of scales, which is the identity map id: Z -> Z.
  # S is the inclusion map i: Z -> *R (the hyperreals).
  # The map from A to S corresponds to the inclusion of G_A=Z into G_S=*R.
  # The quotient space S/A is therefore *R/Z.
  # The cardinality of the hyperreals *R is 2^aleph_0, which is Beth_1.
  # Since Z is countable (cardinality aleph_0 = Beth_0), the cardinality of the
  # quotient |*R/Z| remains Beth_1.
  card_S_A = "Beth_1"

  # Step 2: Cardinality of B/S
  # A terminal object B in the category of scales does not strictly exist. We resolve this by
  # assuming the problem intends for B to be the terminal object from the ambient category
  # of prescales, which is the trivial group {0}. The map B: Z -> {0} is trivial.
  # The map from S to B is a homomorphism from G_S=*R to G_B={0}. The only such map
  # is the zero map, whose image is {0}.
  # The quotient space B/S is thus {0}/{0}, which is the trivial group {0}.
  # The cardinality of the trivial group is 1.
  card_B_S = 1

  # Step 3: Cardinality of H_1(B/A, Q)
  # The group for the homology calculation is the quotient B/A.
  # The map from A to B is a homomorphism from G_A=Z to G_B={0}, i.e. the zero map.
  # Its image is {0}.
  # The quotient group B/A is {0}/{0}, which is the trivial group {0}.
  # The first homology group of a trivial group, with any coefficients, is the
  # trivial group {0}.
  # H_1({0}, Q) = {0}.
  # The cardinality of this group is 1.
  card_H1 = 1
  
  # The problem asks for the answers separated by spaces.
  # It asks to "Express infinite answers in Beth notation" which implies finite answers
  # should be numerals.
  print(f"{card_S_A} {card_B_S} {card_H1}")
