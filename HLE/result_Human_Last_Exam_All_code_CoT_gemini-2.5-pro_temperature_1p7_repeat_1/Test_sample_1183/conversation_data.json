    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule, I will use a computational approach with Python.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Parse the SMILES String**: The provided SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` describes a large, planar, triangular-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with ethynyl groups at its corners.\n2.  **Generate a 3D Structure**: I will use the `rdkit` library to convert the 1D SMILES string into a 3D molecular structure. To ensure a realistic and symmetric geometry, I will generate an initial 3D conformer and then optimize its geometry using the MMFF94s molecular mechanics force field. This step is crucial for the symmetry detection to work correctly.\n3.  **Detect Symmetry**: I will then use the `pyscf` (Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework) library, which has powerful and reliable tools for molecular symmetry analysis. I will create a `pyscf` molecule object from the atom types and the optimized 3D coordinates obtained from `rdkit`.\n4.  **Print the Point Group**: Upon building the molecule object, `pyscf` automatically detects the highest abelian point group symmetry of the given molecular geometry. I will then print this identified point group.\n\nThis computational workflow automates the process of visualizing the molecule and identifying its symmetry elements, providing a robust answer.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\n# Ensure you have rdkit and pyscf installed:\n# pip install rdkit pyscf\nimport sys\nimport numpy as np\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n\n# Suppress RDKit warnings for cleaner output\nfrom rdkit import rdBase\nrdBase.DisableLog('rdApp.warning')\n\ntry:\n    from pyscf import gto\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"PySCF library not found.
