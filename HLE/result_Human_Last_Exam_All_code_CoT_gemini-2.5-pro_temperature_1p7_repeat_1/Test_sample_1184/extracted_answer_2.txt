--- 1. Hotspots for Interaction with Alpha-1 Subunit ---
These residues are crucial for the physical binding between the beta-1 and alpha-1 subunits.
Residue: Tyrosine (Y) at Position 394
  - Function: Forms a key part of the hydrophobic binding groove for the alpha-1 subunit.
  - Equation: Y394 = Core Structural Interaction
Residue: Tryptophan (W) at Position 440
  - Function: Provides a critical hydrophobic contact; its mutation (W440A) can abolish the interaction.
  - Equation: W440 = Core Structural Interaction
Residue: Glutamic Acid (E) at Position 461
  - Function: Forms an essential salt bridge with a corresponding Arginine in the alpha-1 subunit.
  - Equation: E461 = Core Structural Interaction

--- 2. Hotspots for Gating Modulation of Alpha-1 Subunit ---
These residues are critical for fine-tuning the opening/closing properties (gating) of the channel.
Residue: Aspartic Acid (D) at Position 21
  - Function: Located in an N-terminal region shown to shift the voltage-dependence of channel activation.
  - Equation: D21 = Functional Gating Modulation
Residue: Glutamic Acid (E) at Position 26
  - Function: Also part of the N-terminal cluster that modulates the voltage sensitivity of the channel.
  - Equation: E26 = Functional Gating Modulation
Residue: Serine (S) at Position 525
  - Function: Located in the C-terminus; its phosphorylation modulates channel activity, acting as a fine-tuning switch.
  - Equation: S525 = Functional Gating Modulation
