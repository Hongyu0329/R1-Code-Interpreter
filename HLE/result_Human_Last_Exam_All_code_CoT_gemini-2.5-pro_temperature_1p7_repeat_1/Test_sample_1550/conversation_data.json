    "My plan is to find the number of real intersection points for the two given quadric equations. This is equivalent to finding the number of real solutions `(x, y)` to the system of two polynomial equations.\n\n1.  **Represent the equations**: I will define the two equations in a way a computer can understand.\n2.  **Use a Computer Algebra System (CAS)**: Solving such a system by hand is very complex and prone to errors. It typically involves eliminating one variable to get a single quartic (degree 4) polynomial in the other variable, which is hard to solve. I will use Python's `sympy` library, which is a powerful CAS.\n3.  **Solve for Real Solutions**: I will use `sympy`'s `nonlinsolve` function, which is designed for systems of nonlinear equations. A key step is to specify that the variables `x` and `y` must be real numbers. This tells the solver to only find solutions where both coordinates are real, which is exactly what the problem asks for.\n4.  **Count the Solutions**: The solver will return all possible real solution pairs `(x, y)`. The number of these pairs is the final answer.\n\nThis approach is robust and avoids the difficult and tedious manual algebra.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_quadric_system():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of real intersection points for the two given quadric equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variables x and y, specifying they must be real.\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y', real=True)\n\n    # First quadric equation: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    # Store the equation as an expression.
