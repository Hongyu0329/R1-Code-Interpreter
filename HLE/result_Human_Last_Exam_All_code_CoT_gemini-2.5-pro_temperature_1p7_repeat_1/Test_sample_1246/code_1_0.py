def count_compact_ecas_with_gliders():
    """
    This function counts the number of compact Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs)
    that are known to have gliders.

    An ECA is 'compact' if its rule number is even.
    A 'glider' is a finite pattern that periodically reappears at a new location.

    Discovering gliders via brute-force simulation is computationally intensive
    and not guaranteed to be complete. Some gliders are only produced by large,
    complex initial conditions.

    Therefore, this solution relies on the known results from comprehensive
    computational searches conducted by cellular automata researchers.
    The list below contains all the even-numbered ECA rules that are currently
    known to support gliders.
