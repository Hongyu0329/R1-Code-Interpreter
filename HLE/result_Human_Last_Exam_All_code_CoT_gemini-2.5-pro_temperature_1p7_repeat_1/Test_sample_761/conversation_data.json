    "To answer your question, I will create a Python script that defines and compares the fundamental building blocks (monomers) and linkages of both polysaccharides and homopolynucleotides. This will programmatically illustrate why they are structurally different.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the structure of a monosaccharide, the monomer for a polysaccharide.\n2.  Define the structure of a nucleotide, the monomer for a polynucleotide.\n3.  Represent the respective polymers by describing their monomers and the chemical bonds that link them.\n4.  Print a clear, comparative analysis based on these definitions to conclude whether they are structurally the same.\n\n```python\ndef compare_polymers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the structure of polysaccharides and polynucleotides.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define Polysaccharide Structure ---\n    polysaccharide_monomer = {\n        \"name\": \"Monosaccharide (e.g., Glucose)\",\n        \"components\": [\"Sugar Unit\"]\n    }\n    polysaccharide_bond = \"Glycosidic Bond\"\n    polysaccharide = {\n        \"polymer_type\": \"Polysaccharide\",\n        \"monomer\": polysaccharide_monomer,\n        \"linking_bond\": polysaccharide_bond\n    }\n\n    # --- Define Homopolynucleotide Structure ---\n    # A homopolynucleotide is just a specific type of polynucleotide\n    polynucleotide_monomer = {\n        \"name\": \"Nucleotide (e.g., Adenosine Monophosphate)\",\n        \"components\": [\"Phosphate Group\", \"5-Carbon Sugar (Ribose/Deoxyribose)\", \"Nitrogenous Base (e.g., Adenine)\"]\n    }\n    polynucleotide_bond = \"Phosphodiester Bond\"\n    homopolynucleotide = {\n        \"polymer_type\": \"Homopolynucleotide\",\n        \"monomer\": polynucleotide_monomer,\n        \"linking_bond\": polynucleotide_bond\n    }\n\n    # --- Print Comparison and Conclusion ---\n    print(\"--- Structural Comparison: Polysaccharide vs. Homopolynucleotide ---\\n\")\n\n    # Print Polysaccharide details\n    print(f\"1.
