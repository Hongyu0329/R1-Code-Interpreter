    "Based on historical accounts of the Lam Sơn uprising, Ming General Mu Sheng led one of the two main reinforcement armies in 1427 to relieve the besieged Ming forces at Đông Quan (Hanoi). After the other Ming army, led by Liu Sheng, was catastrophically defeated at Chi Lăng Pass (in modern Lạng Sơn Province), Mu Sheng, then in the area of modern Bắc Giang, lost his nerve and began to retreat.\n\nHis army was subsequently pursued and shattered by the Vietnamese forces at Lãnh Câu (Cold Water Ravine) and Đan Xá on the Thương River. This rout of the army under his direct command was his most significant defeat in the campaign. These locations are in the modern-day **Bắc Giang Province**.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to output this information.\n\n```python\ndef find_province_of_defeat():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng\n    experienced his first major defeat during the Lam Sơn Uprising.\n\n    The defeat in question is the rout of his army at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá\n    during the Chi Lăng - Xương Giang Campaign of 1427.\n    \"\"\"\n    province = \"Bắc Giang Province\"\n    print(f\"The first major defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng occurred in the area of modern-day: {province}\")\n\nfind_province_of_defeat()\n```\n<<<Bắc Giang Province>>>"
