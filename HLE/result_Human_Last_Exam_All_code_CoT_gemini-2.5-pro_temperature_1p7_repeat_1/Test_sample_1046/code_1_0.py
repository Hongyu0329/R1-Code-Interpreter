    # The central problem: How can a bacterium with rare mutations (Bacterium 2)
    # keep pace with a bacterium with frequent gene sharing (Bacterium 1)?
    # The answer must explain a mechanism that makes the rare mutation event
    # exceptionally effective once it occurs.

    # Option A analysis:
    print("Option A: Rare mutations occurred in the second bacterium causing it to acquire resistance.")
    print("Analysis: This is the starting point for Bacterium 2, but it does not explain the 'equal pace'. It is incomplete.\n")

    # Option B analysis:
    print("Option B: The second bacterial population acquired compensatory mutations that increased the fitness to a great extent and also led to cross-resistance following the rare resistance mutations.")
    print("Analysis: This is a very strong explanation. A rare mutation grants resistance, but often with a fitness cost. 'Compensatory mutations' negate this cost, allowing the resistant strain to multiply rapidly. 'Cross-resistance' means this single event protects against multiple drugs, making it extremely efficient. This combination fully explains the rapid spread and 'equal pace'.\n")

    # Option C analysis:
    print("Option C: There was most likely some contamination...")
    print("Analysis: This proposes an experimental error rather than a biological mechanism. It avoids answering the core question.\n")

    # Option D analysis:
    print("Option D: ...mutations that did not have compensatory mutations...and they also led to cross-resistance.")
    print("Analysis: This is weaker than B. Without compensatory mutations, the fitness cost would likely prevent the resistant strain from spreading fast enough to keep pace.\n")

    # Option E analysis:
    print("Option E: ...acquired compensatory mutations that followed the rare resistance mutations.")
    print("Analysis: This is part of the correct answer but is incomplete. It lacks the critical factor of 'cross-resistance' which helps explain the high efficiency of the mutation.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Option B provides the most comprehensive mechanism for Bacterium 2 to match the pace of Bacterium 1.")

    # Fulfilling the request for a final equation by representing the logic numerically.
    print("\nThe final equation for Bacterium 2's success can be represented as the sum of its advantages:")
    # The numbers in the equation represent the key factors mentioned in the best answer.
    print("1 (rare resistance mutation) + 1 (compensatory mutations) + 1 (cross-resistance) = 3 effective factors leading to an equal pace.")
