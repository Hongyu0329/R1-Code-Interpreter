    "The task is to identify the type of conceptual metaphor expressed by the phrase \"my love for humanity\". To do this, I will first outline the key types of conceptual metaphors as defined by Lakoff and Johnson, who are the pioneers of this theory. Then, I will analyze the given phrase against these definitions to find the best fit.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define Conceptual Metaphor Types:** I'll explain the primary categories: Structural, Orientational, and Ontological metaphors. This provides the framework for the analysis.\n2.  **Analyze the Phrase:** I will break down \"my love for humanity\". The key parts are \"my love\", which treats an emotion as a possession, and \"love for humanity\", which gives it direction.\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:** By comparing the analysis of the phrase with the definitions, I'll determine the most appropriate category. The phrase structures the abstract concept of 'love' using the more concrete concepts of 'possession' and 'direction', which is characteristic of a structural metaphor.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically presents this reasoning, defines the options, and prints the step-by-step analysis leading to the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_metaphor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the phrase \"my love for humanity\" to determine its conceptual metaphor type.\n    \"\"\"\n    phrase = \"my love for humanity\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Conceptual metaphor',\n        'B': 'Physical metaphor',\n        'C': 'Orientational metaphor',\n        'D': 'Structural metaphor',\n        'E': 'Intentional metaphor'\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the conceptual metaphor in the phrase: '{phrase}'\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the relevant metaphor types from Lakoff & Johnson's theory.\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding Key Conceptual Metaphor Types\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\" - Orientational Metaphor: Relates concepts to spatial orientation (e.g., up/down, in/out). Example: HAPPY IS UP ('I'm feeling up today').\")\n    print(\" - Ontological Metaphor: Treats abstract things (emotions, ideas) as concrete entities or substances. Example: INFLATION IS AN ENTITY ('We must fight inflation').\")\n    print(\" - Structural Metaphor: Structures one abstract concept in terms of a more concrete or different concept. Example: ARGUMENT IS WAR ('He won the argument').\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the given phrase.\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the Phrase\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The phrase '{phrase}' conceptualizes the abstract emotion of 'love' in specific ways:\")\n    print(\" 1.
