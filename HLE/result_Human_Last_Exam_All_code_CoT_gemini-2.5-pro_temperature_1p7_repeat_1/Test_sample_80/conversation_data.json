    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard. The formula for this is `(number_of_squares_per_side * 4) - 4`, where we subtract 4 because the corner squares are counted twice.\n2.  Next, consider the rule for placing bishops. To place the maximum number of bishops so that none can attack each other, they must all be on squares of the same color.\n3.  On a chessboard, the edge squares are evenly divided between black and white squares. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the edge is equal to the total number of edge squares divided by two.\n4.  Finally, calculate the number of edge squares that will be empty. This is the total number of edge squares minus the number of squares occupied by bishops.\n5.  The Python code will implement these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishop_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard when the\n    maximum number of non-attacking bishops are placed on the edge.\n    \"\"\"\n    side_length = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An 8x8 board has 8 squares per side. The four sides have 8*4=32 squares,\n    # but the 4 corner squares are counted twice. So, 32 - 4 = 28.\n    total_edge_squares = (side_length * 4) - 4\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    # To maximize the number of non-attacking bishops, they must all be placed on\n    # squares of the same color. The 28 edge squares are split evenly: 14 white\n    # and 14 black. So, the maximum number of bishops is 14.\n    max_bishops_placed = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate how many edge squares lack bishops.\n    # This is the total number of edge squares minus the number occupied by bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_placed\n\n    print(\"Total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board:\", total_edge_squares)\n    print(\"Maximum non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge:\", max_bishops_placed)\n    print(\"Therefore, the number of edge squares that would lack bishops is:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops_placed} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishop_puzzle()\n```\n<<<14>>>"
