    # The core problem with radical emitters is bimolecular quenching,
    # where an excited-state radical (a doublet exciton) is deactivated
    # by a ground-state radical. This is a non-radiative process.
    # D1 (excited) + D0 (ground) -> D0 + D0 + heat
    
    # This process directly competes with the desired light-emitting process:
    # D1 (excited) -> D0 (ground) + light
    
    # This non-radiative quenching reduces the number of photons emitted for every
    # electron injected into the device. The metric that measures this
    # relationship (photons out / electrons in) is the External Quantum
    # Efficiency (EQE).
    
    # Therefore, the quenching of excitons by radicals leads to a low EQE.
