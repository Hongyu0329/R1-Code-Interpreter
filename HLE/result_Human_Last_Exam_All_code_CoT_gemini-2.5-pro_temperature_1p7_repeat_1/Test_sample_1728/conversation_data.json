    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** First, I will identify the structure of the graph \\(G\\). The \"sum of three cycles\" refers to the graph join operation. So, the graph \\(G\\) is the join of three cycles of length \\(n\\), which we can write as \\(G = C_n + C_n + C_n\\).\n\n2.  **Apply Chromatic Number Properties:** I will use a well-known property of graph coloring: the chromatic number of a join of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers. This means \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cycle's Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) depends on its length \\(n\\).\n    *   If \\(n\\) is even, \\(C_n\\) is bipartite and \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\(n\\) is odd, \\(C_n\\) requires an extra color, so \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n4.  **Determine the Maximum:** The question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\(G\\). To maximize \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\), we must use the maximum possible value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\), which is 3 (when \\(n\\) is odd).\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will create a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step and prints the final calculation that yields the maximal chromatic number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum \n    of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Define the graph G and the chromatic number of a graph join.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is the sum (join) of three cycles of length n: G = C_n + C_n + C_n.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a graph join is the sum of the individual chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, chi(G) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) = 3 * chi(C_n).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the possible chromatic numbers for a single cycle C_n.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a cycle C_n depends on the parity of n (for n >= 3):\")\n    print(\"- chi(C_n) = 2, if n is even.\")\n    print(\"- chi(C_n) = 3, if n is odd.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the maximal chromatic number for G.\")\n    print(\"To find the maximal value for chi(G), we must use the maximal value for chi(C_n).\")\n    \n    num_cycles = 3\n    max_chi_cn = 3 # The maximum chromatic number for a single cycle occurs when n is odd.\n    \n    print(f\"The number of cycles is {num_cycles}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximal chromatic number of a single cycle is {max_chi_cn}.\")\n    \n    maximal_chromatic_number_G = num_cycles * max_chi_cn\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"The maximal chromatic number of G is found by the equation:\")\n    # The final equation with each number printed, as requested.\n    print(f\"{num_cycles} * {max_chi_cn} = {maximal_chromatic_number_G}\")\n\nsolve_maximal_chromatic_number()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
