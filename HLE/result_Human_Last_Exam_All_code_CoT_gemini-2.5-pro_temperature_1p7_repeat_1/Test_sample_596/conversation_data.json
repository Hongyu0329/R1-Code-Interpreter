    "To solve this problem, we need to use a result from combinatorial algebraic topology, specifically from the \"A-theory\" of a simplicial complex, which relates the number of certain structures on the complex to its homology groups.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Identify the governing theorem:** The question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$ ... that fail to have the forest $F$ simplicially collapse onto the root $R$.\" This quantity, interpreted as a specific weighted count called the A-theory characteristic, is given by a theorem from Duval, Klivans, and Martin. The theorem states that this number is equal to the squared order of the torsion subgroup of the $(d-1)$-th integer homology group of the space, where $d$ is the dimension of the complex. The formula is:\n    \n    Number = $|T(H_{d-1}(K; \\mathbb{Z}))|^2$\n    \n    where $K$ is the simplicial complex, $d$ is its dimension, $H_{d-1}(K; \\mathbb{Z})$ is its $(d-1)$-th homology group with integer coefficients, and $T(\\cdot)$ denotes the torsion subgroup.\n\n2.  **Determine the parameters for the Möbius band:**\n    *   The Möbius band is a 2-dimensional surface, so the corresponding simplicial complex $K$ has dimension $d=2$.\n    *   We are interested in the $(d-1)$-th homology group, which is $H_{2-1}(K; \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(K; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the first homology group of the Möbius band:** The first homology group of the Möbius band, $M$, with integer coefficients is $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This can be shown by noting that the Möbius band deformation retracts onto its core circle ($S^1$), and the homology of a circle is well-known: $H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n4.  **Find the torsion subgroup and its order:** The group $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ is the group of integers. This group is torsion-free, meaning its only torsion element is the identity element 0. Therefore, its torsion subgroup is the trivial group, $T(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\{0\\}$. The order (or size) of this subgroup is 1.\n\n5.  **Compute the final answer:** According to the formula, the number we seek is the square of the order of the torsion subgroup. Let $n$ be this order. We found $n=1$. The final answer is $1^2 = 1$.\n\n6.  **Write the code:** The Python code will store the calculated order $n=1$ and compute the final result, printing out the numbers involved in the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the order of the torsion subgroup.\n# Based on the mathematical derivation, the first homology group of the Mobius band, H_1(M; Z), is Z (the integers).\n# The torsion subgroup of Z is the trivial group {0}, whose order is 1.\norder_of_torsion_subgroup = 1\n\n# Step 2: Define the exponent from the theorem's formula.\nexponent = 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final result according to the theorem |T(H_{d-1}(K))|^2.\nresult = order_of_torsion_subgroup ** exponent\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation with each number.\n# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# The equation is: (order_of_torsion_subgroup)^exponent = result.\n# So we print the base, the exponent, and the final result.\nprint(f\"The order of the torsion subgroup is: {order_of_torsion_subgroup}\")\nprint(f\"The exponent in the formula is: {exponent}\")\nprint(f\"The final number of non-collapsing rooted forests (in the weighted sense) is: {result}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is: {order_of_torsion_subgroup}^{exponent} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
