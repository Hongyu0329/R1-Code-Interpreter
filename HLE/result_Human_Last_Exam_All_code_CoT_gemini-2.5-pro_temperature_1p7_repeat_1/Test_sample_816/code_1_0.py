    print("\n1. The observation is that the outer portions of the weld pool flow inwards.")
    print("This indicates a force is pulling or pushing the surface liquid from the cooler edges towards the hotter center.")

    print("\n2. Evaluating the candidate forces:")
    print("   - Arc Drag, Arc Pressure: These forces primarily push the liquid metal outwards from the center. This contradicts the observation.")
    print("   - Buoyancy Force: This force, due to density variations, is generally considered weak and not the dominant driver of surface flow in arc welding.")
    print("   - Lorentz Force: This electromagnetic force creates an inward and downward 'pinch' effect. While it contributes to inward flow, it's a body force acting on the bulk liquid.")
    print("   - Marangoni Force: This is a force driven by a gradient in surface tension.")
    print("     - In most pure metals, surface tension decreases with heat, causing an OUTWARD flow.")
    print("     - However, in stainless steels like 304, surface-active elements (like sulfur) are present.")
    print("     - These elements cause the surface tension to be highest at the hottest point (the center).")
    print("     - This reversed gradient pulls the liquid from the low-tension edges to the high-tension center, creating a strong INWARD surface flow.")

    print("\n3. Conclusion:")
    print("The inward surface flow described is a classic example of the Marangoni effect when the temperature coefficient of surface tension is positive. This is the dominant mechanism for this specific observation in stainless steel.")
    print("\nTherefore, the correct answer is:")
