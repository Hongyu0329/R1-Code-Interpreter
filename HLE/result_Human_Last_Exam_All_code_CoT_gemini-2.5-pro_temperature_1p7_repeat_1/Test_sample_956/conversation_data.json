    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Group G**: The group G is given by three generators acting on a set of 12 elements. I will use the `sympy` library in Python to represent these permutations and construct the group G.\n2.  **Determine Properties of G**: I will compute the order of G and check if it is a simple group. These properties are crucial for identifying G up to isomorphism. A group is simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself.\n3.  **Find the Schur Multiplier A**: Based on the properties of G, I will identify it as a known finite group. The Schur multipliers of many well-known groups, especially the finite simple groups, are standard mathematical results. The Schur multiplier, A, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$ and is always an abelian group.\n4.  **Count Proper Subgroups of A**: Once the structure of the abelian group A is known, I will count its proper subgroups up to isomorphism. A proper subgroup H of A is any subgroup such that H is not equal to A. \"Up to isomorphism\" means we count distinct isomorphism classes of subgroups.\n\nI will now implement this plan in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.combinatorics import Permutation, PermutationGroup\n\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the user's request by performing the following steps:\n    1.
