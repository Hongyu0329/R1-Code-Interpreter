    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Framework**: The problem can be solved within the framework of statistical mechanics by finding the most probable distribution of photons over energy levels, which corresponds to the equilibrium state. This approach of maximizing the number of microstates (and thus, entropy) for a given macrostate is justified by large deviation theorems like Sanov's theorem.\n2.  **Model**: We'll model the light quanta (photons) as a gas of indistinguishable bosons where the total number of particles is not conserved (chemical potential μ=0), but the total energy is fixed.\n3.  **Entropy Maximization**: We will maximize the Boltzmann entropy `S = k_B * ln(Ω)`, where `Ω` is the number of microstates for the Bose-Einstein case, subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy `E`. This maximization procedure yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n4.  **Derivation of E and S**: Using the derived distribution and the continuous density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D volume, we will integrate over all energy levels to find the equilibrium total energy `E` (which results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law) and the equilibrium total entropy `S`.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: The final Python script will define the necessary physical constants, calculate the coefficients in the formulas for `E` and `S`, and print these final equations in a clear and readable format. The code will output the final derived equations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_bose_light_quanta():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    for the Bose case of light quanta (photon gas).\n\n    The derivation is based on maximizing the entropy for a system of bosons with\n    non-conserved particle number, a result underpinned by large deviation theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define fundamental physical constants\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\n    c = 299792458     # Speed of light in m/s\n    pi = math.pi\n\n    print(\"The equilibrium state is found by maximizing the entropy S for a photon gas at a fixed mean energy E.\")\n    print(\"This leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons, which can be used to derive the macroscopic thermodynamic properties.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Mean Energy Calculation ---\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Mean Energy (E) ---\")\n    print(\"The theoretical formula for the mean energy E of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is:\")\n    print(\"E = (8 * \\u03c0\\u2075 * k_B\\u2074 / (15 * h\\u00b3 * c\\u00b3)) * V * T\\u2074\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the numerical value of the coefficient for Energy (Radiation Constant a)\n    energy_coefficient = (8 * pi**5 * k_B**4) / (15 * h**3 * c**3)\n\n    print(\"Substituting the values of the constants (\\u03c0, k_B, h, c):\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient (radiation constant 'a') = (8 * {pi:.5f}\\u2075 * ({k_B:.4e})\\u2074) / (15 * ({h:.4e})\\u00b3 * ({c:.4e})\\u00b3)\")\n    print(f\"a = {energy_coefficient:.4e} J m\\u207b\\u00b3 K\\u207b\\u2074\\n\")\n    print(\"So, the final equation for mean energy is:\")\n    print(f\"E = {energy_coefficient:.4e} * V * T\\u2074\\n\")\n\n    # --- Entropy Calculation ---\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Entropy (S) ---\")\n    print(\"The theoretical formula for the entropy S of a photon gas is:\")\n    print(\"S = (32 * \\u03c0\\u2075 * k_B\\u2074 / (45 * h\\u00b3 * c\\u00b3)) * V * T\\u00b3\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the numerical value of the coefficient for Entropy\n    entropy_coefficient = (32 * pi**5 * k_B**4) / (45 * h**3 * c**3)\n    \n    print(\"Substituting the values of the constants:\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient 'b' = (32 * {pi:.5f}\\u2075 * ({k_B:.4e})\\u2074) / (45 * ({h:.4e})\\u00b3 * ({c:.4e})\\u00b3)\")\n    print(f\"b = {entropy_coefficient:.4e} J m\\u207b\\u00b3 K\\u207b\\u00b3\\n\")\n    print(\"So, the final equation for entropy is:\")\n    print(f\"S = {entropy_coefficient:.4e} * V * T\\u00b3\\n\")\n\n    # --- Relationship between E and S ---\n    print(\"--- Relationship between E and S ---\")\n    print(\"From the expressions above, we can find a direct relationship between entropy and energy:\")\n    print(\"S = (4/3) * E / T\")\n    print(f\"S = (4/3) * ({k_B:.4e}) * \\u03b2 * E, where \\u03b2 = 1/(k_B * T)\")\n\nsolve_bose_light_quanta()\n<<<\nE = (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^4\nS = (32 * pi^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3)) * V * T^3\n>>>"
