# Evaluate each geological statement and assign 'C' for consensus or 'D' for debated.

# (1) The Morrison formation represents a foredeep deposit.
# Consensus (C): It is widely accepted as a foreland basin deposit related to the Sevier orogeny.
s1 = "C"

# (2) Metamorphic core complexes formed in response to a slab window.
# Debated (D): This is one of several competing hypotheses; gravitational collapse is another major one.
s2 = "D"

# (3) An orogenic plateau (the "Nevadaplano") existed in present-day Nevada by the end of the Cretaceous.
# Consensus (C): Strong evidence from paleoaltimetry supports the existence of a high plateau.
s3 = "C"

# (4) An orogenic plateau in the Arizona portion of the Cordillera (the "Arizonaplano") was constructed via magmatic thickening of the crust in the late Cretaceous.
# Debated (D): This is a more recent and less established hypothesis than the Nevadaplano.
s4 = "D"

# (5) Laramide-style structures are generally inboard of Sevier-style structures.
# Consensus (C): This is a fundamental spatial observation of North American Cordilleran tectonics.
s5 = "C"

# (6) The Sierra Nevada batholith and Idaho Batholith were formed by the ancestral Cordilleran arc.
# Consensus (C): This is textbook geology; they are the plutonic roots of the Mesozoic subduction zone arc.
s6 = "C"

# (7) A series of large-magnitude ignimbrite eruptions began in Idaho and Montana in the Eocene and propagated generally to the southwest.
# Consensus (C): The track of the ignimbrite flare-up and its southwest propagation is a well-documented phenomenon.
s7 = "C"

# (8) The Colorado Plateau reached modern elevations by the late Cretaceous, and may have been uplifted further by Cenozoic delamination of mantle lithosphere.
# Debated (D): The uplift history of the Colorado Plateau is one of the most famous debates in geology.
s8 = "D"

# (9) The Cascades arc reached modern elevation by the late Oligocene, but experienced a Pliocene-present flare-up.
# Debated (D): The modern high Cascade volcanoes are much younger than Oligocene, making the timing of uplift a debated topic.
s9 = "D"

# (10) Laramide-style deformation was caused by subduction of the Shatsky conjugate.
# Debated (D): While this is a leading hypothesis, it is not universally proven and remains a debated topic.
s10 = "D"

# Combine the results into a single string.
final_answer = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 + s7 + s8 + s9 + s10
