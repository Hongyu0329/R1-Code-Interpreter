    # Step 1: Establish an upper bound for n.
    # The 'n' points of set S lie on a circle C with center O.
    # To be connected, every point in S must lie on at least one of the 9 lines.
    # A line can intersect a circle at a maximum of 2 points.

    # The total number of points 'n' is the size of the union of the intersection
    # points of each line with the circle. The size of a union of sets is at most
    # the sum of the sizes of the individual sets.
    # Therefore, n <= (number of lines) * (max intersection points per line).
    max_n = num_lines * max_points_per_line_on_circle

    # Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable with a valid configuration.
    # Consider a configuration where all 9 lines pass through the center O.
    # These lines will intersect the circle at 9 * 2 = 18 distinct points.
    # Let S be this set of 18 points, so n = 18.
    
    # Step 3: Verify the connectivity for the n=18 case.
    # The full set of points is T = S U {O}.
    # - Path from O to any point P_i in S: P_i is on some line L_k. By construction,
    #   O is also on L_k. This is a 1-line path.
    # - Path from any point P_i to another P_j: P_i is on line L_a and P_j is on L_b.
    #   Since all lines intersect at O, there is always a path from P_i to P_j
    #   via O in at most 2 lines.

    # Final Conclusion: The reasoning shows n is at most 18, and the constructed
    # example shows that n=18 is possible.
