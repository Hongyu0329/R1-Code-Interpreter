    "To determine the number of states in the minimal deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) that recognizes the given language, we will use a computational approach. The regular expression is complex, making a manual construction of the DFA error-prone. A reliable method is to use a software library designed for automata theory.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Represent the Regular Expression**: We will take the given regular expression and format it as a string.\n2.  **Regex to NFA**: We'll use a Python library, `automata-lib`, to parse this string and convert it into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This is a standard first step in the process (Thompson's construction).\n3.  **NFA to DFA**: The library will then convert the NFA into an equivalent DFA using the subset construction algorithm.\n4.  **Minimize DFA**: The resulting DFA is not necessarily minimal. We will apply a minimization algorithm (like Hopcroft's algorithm) to reduce it to the minimal DFA for the language.\n5.  **Count States**: Finally, we will count the number of states in the minimized DFA.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. You may need to install the required library first by running `pip install automata-lib`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Ensure the 'automata-lib' library is installed.\n    # You can install it using pip: pip install automata-lib\n    from automata.fa.nfa import NFA\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"The 'automata-lib' library is not installed.\")\n    print(\"Please install it by running: pip install automata-lib\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve_dfa_states():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of states in the minimal DFA\n    for the given regular expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The language L is defined by the regular expression:\n    # ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*\n    # We represent this as a string that the library can parse.\n    # The library uses standard regex syntax: '|' for union, '*' for Kleene star,\n    # and juxtaposition for concatenation.\n    regex_string = \"((b|c)*a(a|bc|cb|bbb)*(ba|bba|ca))*(b|c)*a(a|bc|cb|bbb)*\"\n\n    print(f\"Regular Expression: {regex_string}\")\n\n    # 1. Create an NFA from the regular expression.\n    # The library will automatically infer the alphabet {a, b, c}.\n    nfa = NFA.from_regex(regex_string)\n\n    # 2. Convert the NFA to a DFA.\n    dfa = nfa.to_dfa()\n\n    # 3. Minimize the DFA.\n    min_dfa = dfa.minify()\n\n    # 4. Count the number of states in the minimal DFA.\n    num_states = len(min_dfa.states)\n\n    print(f\"The number of states in the minimal DFA is: {num_states}\")\n    \n    # Although not requested, for completeness, we can show the states and transitions\n    # print(\"\\n--- Minimal DFA Details ---\")\n    # print(\"States:\", min_dfa.states)\n    # print(\"Initial State:\", min_dfa.initial_state)\n    # print(\"Final States:\", min_dfa.final_states)\n    # print(\"Transitions:\")\n    # for from_state, transitions in min_dfa.transitions.items():\n    #     for symbol, to_state in transitions.items():\n    #         print(f\"  {from_state} --{symbol}--> {to_state}\")\n    # print(\"-------------------------\\n\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_dfa_states()\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
