    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use a procedure analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers or polynomials. This method involves performing elementary row operations on a composite matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Form a Composite Matrix**: Construct a single matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    `M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]`\n2.  **Apply Elementary Row Operations**: The GCRD is invariant under elementary row operations (which correspond to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix). We will perform a series of these operations to simplify `M` into an upper triangular form (or more specifically, a row-echelon form).\n    The operations are:\n    a. Swapping two rows.\n    b. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    c. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Reduce the Matrix**: The goal is to reduce the matrix `M` to the form `[G(s); 0]`, where `G(s)` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is a 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting matrix `G(s)` will be a GCRD of `P1` and `P2`.\n4.  **Extract the GCRD**: Once the reduction is complete, the non-zero rows will form the GCRD matrix. We will then normalize it to a canonical form, typically making the leading coefficient of each row positive and monic if possible.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic matrix operations and find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two\n    given polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using the Euclidean algorithm method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set up the symbolic variable and matrices\n    s = sympy.symbols('s')\n\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # Explain the initial setup\n    print(\"The initial matrices are P1 and P2:\")\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n\n    # Form the composite matrix M\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"\\nWe form the composite matrix M = [P1; P2]:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # --- Start of Elementary Row Operations ---\n\n    # The 4th row has a constant '1' at M[3, 1], which makes a good pivot.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Use R4 to eliminate elements in the second column of R1 and R2.\")\n    print(\"Performing R1 <- R1 + s*R4 and R2 <- R2 - s^2*R4\")\n    \n    # R1 <- R1 + s*R4\n    M[0, :] = sympy.expand(M[0, :] + s * M[3, :])\n    # R2 <- R2 - s^2*R4\n    M[1, :] = sympy.expand(M[1, :] - s**2 * M[3, :])\n\n    print(\"The matrix becomes:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # After Step 1, the matrix has zero rows and rows with polynomials only in the first column.\n    # We now apply the Euclidean algorithm to the polynomials in the first column of the non-zero rows.\n    # The relevant polynomials are from R2 (s**3 - 1) and R3 (s).\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply Euclidean algorithm on the first column of R2 and R3.\")\n    print(\"Performing R2 <- R2 - s^2*R3, since (s^3 - 1) = s^2*(s) - 1.\")\n\n    M[1, :] = sympy.expand(M[1, :] - s**2 * M[2, :])\n    \n    print(\"The matrix becomes:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # Now we have a constant (-1) in R2, which is an excellent pivot to eliminate other elements.\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Use the new R2 to eliminate other elements in the first column.\")\n    print(\"Performing R3 <- R3 + s*R2 and R4 <- R4 - (s+1)*R2\")\n\n    # R3 <- R3 + s*R2\n    M[2, :] = sympy.expand(M[2, :] + s * M[1, :])\n    # R4 <- R4 - (s+1)*R2\n    M[3, :] = sympy.expand(M[3, :] - (s + 1) * M[1, :])\n    \n    print(\"The matrix becomes:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # The reduction is complete.
