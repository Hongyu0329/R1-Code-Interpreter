# The riddle points to a type of coffee.
# "Cafi." is a misrepresentation of "Caffè", the Italian word for coffee.
# The preference for the "peculiar" and "not of the correct" version
# is a pun on the name of the drink itself.

# The correct name is "Caffè Corretto", which means "corrected coffee" - an
# espresso with a shot of liquor. This fits the description perfectly.

correct_name = "Caffè Corretto"

# We will now print the correct name to the console.
# The following loop prints each character of the name individually.
for char in correct_name:
    print(char, end="")

# Print a newline character at the end for clean formatting.
print()
