    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a Full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the total number of electrons ($N_\\mathrm{elec}$)** in the molecule.\n2.  **Determine the total number of basis functions**, which corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals ($N_\\mathrm{orb}$), for the given basis set.\n3.  **Apply the formula** for the number of singlet CSFs in a Full CI calculation.\n\nHere is the detailed breakdown:\n\n**Step 1: Number of Electrons ($N_\\mathrm{elec}$)**\nThe molecule given is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$, which we interpret as having the composition C(1), H(3), Si(1), F(1). We sum the atomic numbers (number of electrons) for each atom to find the total:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\nTotal electrons $N_\\mathrm{elec} = (1 \\times 6) + (3 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 14) + (1 \\times 9) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\nFor a singlet ground state, the electrons are paired, so the number of alpha electrons ($N_\\alpha$) equals the number of beta electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n$N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N_\\mathrm{elec} / 2 = 16$.\n\n**Step 2: Number of Basis Functions ($N_\\mathrm{orb}$)**\nWe need to count the number of basis functions for each atom in the 6-31G** basis set (also known as 6-31G(d,p)).\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H)**: The 6-31G basis provides 2 functions (a split 1s orbital). The second `*` (or `p`) adds one set of p-polarization functions (3 functions: p_x, p_y, p_z). Total per H = 2 + 3 = 5.\n*   **For each heavy atom (C, Si, F)**: The 6-31G basis provides 9 functions. The first `*` (or `d`) adds one set of d-polarization functions. Using the standard 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_x², d_y², d_z², d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), this adds 6 functions. Total per heavy atom = 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nTotal number of orbitals $N_\\mathrm{orb} = (1 \\times \\text{C}) + (3 \\times \\text{H}) + (1 \\times \\text{Si}) + (1 \\times \\text{F})$\n$N_\\mathrm{orb} = (1 \\times 15) + (3 \\times 5) + (1 \\times 15) + (1 \\times 15) = 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 60$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of CSFs**\nFor a Full CI calculation with $N_\\mathrm{orb}$ spatial orbitals and $N_\\mathrm{elec}$ electrons in a singlet state (total spin S=0), the number of CSFs is given by the formula:\n$N_\\mathrm{CSF} = \\binom{N_\\mathrm{orb}}{N_\\alpha}^2 - \\binom{N_\\mathrm{orb}}{N_\\alpha-1}^2$\nPlugging in our values, $N_\\mathrm{orb} = 60$ and $N_\\alpha = 16$:\n$N_\\mathrm{CSF} = \\binom{60}{16}^2 - \\binom{60}{15}^2$\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_csf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of singlet CSFs for a Full CI calculation\n    of CH2SiHF with a 6-31G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the number of electrons.\n    # C(6) + H(3) + Si(14) + F(9) = 32 electrons.\n    n_elec = 32\n    # For a singlet state, n_alpha = n_beta = n_elec / 2\n    n_alpha = n_elec // 2\n\n    # Step 2: Define the number of basis functions (orbitals).\n    # C, Si, F in 6-31G** are 15 basis functions each.\n    # H in 6-31G** is 5 basis functions each.\n    # Total = 1*C + 3*H + 1*Si + 1*F = 1*15 + 3*5 + 1*15 + 1*15 = 60\n    n_orb = 60\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the formula for the number of singlet CSFs.\n    # Formula: N_csf = (comb(n_orb, n_alpha))^2 - (comb(n_orb, n_alpha - 1))^2\n    \n    # Calculate the binomial coefficients\n    term1_comb = math.comb(n_orb, n_alpha)\n    term2_comb = math.comb(n_orb, n_alpha - 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of CSFs\n    n_csf = term1_comb**2 - term2_comb**2\n\n    # Print the equation with the calculated numbers\n    print(f\"The number of orbitals (N_orb) is: {n_orb}\")\n    print(f\"The number of alpha electrons (N_alpha) is: {n_alpha}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the number of singlet CSFs using the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N_CSF = (C(N_orb, N_alpha))^2 - (C(N_orb, N_alpha - 1))^2\")\n    print(f\"N_CSF = (C({n_orb}, {n_alpha}))^2 - (C({n_orb}, {n_alpha - 1}))^2\")\n    print(f\"N_CSF = ({term1_comb})^2 - ({term2_comb})^2\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of singlet CSFs is: {n_csf}\")\n\ncalculate_csf()\n```\n<<<43606167739613274641975876352>>>"
