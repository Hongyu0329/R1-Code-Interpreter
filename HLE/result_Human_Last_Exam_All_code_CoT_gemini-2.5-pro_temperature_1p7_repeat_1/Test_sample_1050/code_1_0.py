    # 2. Determine the number of monsters and their distribution.
    # Monsters are in each row except the first and the last.
    # So, they are in rows 2, 3, ..., 2023 (which is num_rows - 1).
    num_monsters = (num_rows - 1) - 2 + 1

    # 3. Formulate the strategy and analyze the worst-case scenario.
    # The goal is to find the single safe column out of 2023 columns.
    # A rational strategy for Turbo is to test one column at a time. For example,
    # on attempt 1, he tries to go down column 1.
    #
    # If an attempt fails, he discovers a monster and learns that the column he
    # just tried is unsafe. No matter how complex a path Turbo takes, an
    # adversary (who places the monsters) can always put a monster at the first
    # new column Turbo probes in that path. Therefore, in the worst-case,
    # a single attempt can only eliminate one column from the list of
    # potentially safe columns.
    #
    # To guarantee a win, Turbo must account for the worst possible luck. The
    # worst case is that he tries every single unsafe column before he tries
    # the safe one.
    
    # This would result in a number of failed attempts equal to the number of unsafe columns.
    worst_case_failed_attempts = num_unsafe_columns

    # After failing that many times, Turbo has successfully identified all
    # the unsafe columns. By elimination, he knows the identity of the one
    # remaining safe column.

    # His next attempt will be in that known safe column and is guaranteed to succeed.
