    # Step 1: Find the total number of knot types with 7 crossings.
    # According to the standard Rolfsen/Thistlethwaite knot tables, which do not
    # distinguish between a knot and its mirror image, there are exactly 7
    # distinct types of prime knots with 7 crossings. They are denoted 7_1 through 7_7.
    total_knots = 7
    
    # Step 2: Identify which of these 7 knots are hyperbolic.
    # By Thurston's geometrization theorem, a knot is hyperbolic unless it is a
    # torus knot or a satellite knot. We examine each of the 7 prime knots:
    # - 7_1: This is the T(7,2) torus knot. It is NOT hyperbolic.
    # - 7_2: This knot is hyperbolic.
    # - 7_3: This knot is hyperbolic.
    # - 7_4: This knot is hyperbolic.
    # - 7_5: This knot is hyperbolic.
    # - 7_6: This knot is hyperbolic.
    # - 7_7: This knot is hyperbolic.
    # There are no satellite knots with 7 crossings, as the simplest ones are composite
    # knots like 3_1#3_1 (6 crossings) or 3_1#4_1 (7 crossings), but the standard list
    # of knots 7_1..7_7 consists of prime knots only.

    # Step 3: Count the number of hyperbolic knots.
    # From the classification above, only one knot (7_1) is not hyperbolic.
