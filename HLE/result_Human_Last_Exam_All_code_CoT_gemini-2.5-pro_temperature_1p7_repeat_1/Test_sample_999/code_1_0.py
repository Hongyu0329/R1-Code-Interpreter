    compute-intensive parts of a network (like linear layers) are quantized, while others remain
    in higher precision. This provides a good balance between speed and accuracy.""",

        'B': """Correct. This describes a state-of-the-art technique for quantizing models. Per-token
    scaling for activations and per-channel scaling for weights maps very well to the
    architecture of NVIDIA Tensor Cores (Turing and later), which can perform the core
    INT8 matrix multiplication at high speed and apply the scaling factors efficiently afterward.""",

        'C': """Correct. Even without direct native hardware execution for INT4 matrix multiplication on all GPUs,
    specialized kernels (e.g., in libraries like AWQ or GPTQ) can achieve significant inference
    speed-ups for compute-bound workloads compared to FP32 by dramatically reducing memory
    traffic. The H100 is a much more powerful GPU than the A100 and will achieve higher
    speed-ups with such optimized kernels.""",

        'D': """Incorrect. Non-uniform quantization's main benefit is reducing model size and potentially improving
    accuracy at very low bit-widths. However, it comes at a great performance cost on GPUs like
    the A100. It prevents the use of hardware-accelerated INT8 Tensor Cores because the data
    is not in a uniform integer format. The computation requires inefficient table lookups (gather
    operations) that are much slower than the native, hardware-accelerated FP16 GEMM operations.
    Therefore, it would not bring a 'substantial inference runtime speed-up' compared to FP16.""",

        'E': """Correct. Quantization is not limited to integers. Low-precision floating-point types
    like FP16, BFloat16, and more recently FP8 (an 8-bit float format with native support
    on H100 GPUs) are all used to quantize models from higher-precision formats like FP32."""
