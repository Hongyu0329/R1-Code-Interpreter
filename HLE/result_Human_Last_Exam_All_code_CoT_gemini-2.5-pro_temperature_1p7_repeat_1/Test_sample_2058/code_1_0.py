    This function computes the total mass M(A_5, rho, 2).
    The formula is M(G, rho, p) = (1/|G|) * sum_{phi: Gamma_p -> G} p^(-c_{rho}(phi)).
    This can be calculated by summing contributions from each subgroup H of G.
    The contributions are calculated using known results about Galois extensions of Q_2.
