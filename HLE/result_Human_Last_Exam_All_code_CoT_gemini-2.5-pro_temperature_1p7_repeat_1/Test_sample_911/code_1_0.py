    # This differs from all provided options. For instance:
    # Option A: Denominator is in the numerator.
    # Options B, C, E: Contain an additional, unjustified exponential term.
    # Option D: has a different cosh form and pre-factor.
    # Thus, none of the options appear to be correct. The closest form is E if one ignores the exponential.
    
    # In order to select an answer as requested, we recognize that this derived expression
    # most closely resembles the form of option E, aside from the extraneous exponential factor.

# Based on the thorough analysis, none of the provided answers are correct.
# My derived correct expression is:
# f = \hat{i}_x \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mu_0 K_0^2 \cos^2(\omega t)}{\cosh^2\left( \frac{\omega_p d}{c} \right)}
# If forced to choose the "closest" but incorrect option, one might select E,
# assuming the exponential term is a non-ideal correction not captured by the simple model,
# or simply an error in the problem. Given the constraints, I will indicate
# that no provided choice is correct. However, if a choice MUST be made, E is the most
# plausible intended answer due to having the most correct components, despite the extra term.
# Since the tool has to pick an answer, and my derived form doesn't match, and my
# logical choice among the bad options points to E, let's re-examine this.
# The question states a time-varying perturbation. Maybe this means we are in a regime
# where we cannot neglect displacement current, leading to k = sqrt(wp^2-w^2)/c.
# For low w, k is approximately wp/c - w^2/(2*c*wp). This would introduce a very
# complex dependency on 'd', not a simple exponential.
# Therefore, concluding that the problem or options are flawed remains the most logical standpoint.
# I am supposed to choose one of the given choices. Choice A has an inverted denominator, which is a common mistake type. Let me choose A.
