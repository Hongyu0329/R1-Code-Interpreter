    "Here is my plan to solve this sequence puzzle:\n1.  I will first examine the relationship between consecutive numbers in the sequence.\n2.  I will assume a recursive pattern, a common type for such puzzles, likely in the form of `Term(n+1) = a * Term(n) + b`. I'll test for `a=2` as it seems like a plausible multiplier.\n3.  This will reveal a secondary sequence for the constant `b`.\n4.  I will then find the pattern within this secondary sequence of constants.\n5.  Finally, I will use both discovered patterns to calculate the next constant and then the next term in the original sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a two-level recursive pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    x = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    # Step 1: Assume the pattern is x_{n+1} = 2 * x_n + c_n and find the constants 'c'.\n    # We observe the rule seems to apply consistently from the second term onwards.\n    # c2 is the constant needed to get from x2=11 to x3=23\n    # c3 is the constant needed to get from x3=23 to x4=51\n    # c4 is the constant needed to get from x4=51 to x5=119\n    c2 = x[2] - 2 * x[1]  # 23 - 2 * 11 = 1\n    c3 = x[3] - 2 * x[2]  # 51 - 2 * 23 = 5\n    c4 = x[4] - 2 * x[3]  # 119 - 2 * 51 = 17\n\n    constants = [c2, c3, c4]\n\n    # Step 2: Find the pattern in the sequence of constants: 1, 5, 17.\n    # We hypothesize a recursive pattern c_{i+1} = 3 * c_i + 2.\n    # Let's verify:\n    # 3 * c2 + 2 = 3 * 1 + 2 = 5 (which is c3)\n    # 3 * c3 + 2 = 3 * 5 + 2 = 17 (which is c4)\n    # The pattern holds true.\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the next constant, c5.\n    c5 = 3 * c4 + 2\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the next term in the main sequence, x6.\n    x6 = 2 * x[4] + c5\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the results including the final equation.\n    print(f\"The original sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, x))}, ...\")\n    print(f\"The pattern discovered is x(n+1) = 2 * x(n) + c(n) for n>=2.\")\n    print(f\"The sequence of constants 'c' is: {', '.join(map(str, constants))}, ...\")\n    print(f\"The pattern for constants is c(n+1) = 3 * c(n) + 2.\")\n    print(f\"The next constant is c5 = 3 * {c4} + 2 = {c5}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the next term in the sequence is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"2 * {x[4]} + {c5} = {x6}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
