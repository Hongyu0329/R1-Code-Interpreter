    "My task is to identify the specific conceptual entity that Fernand Braudel, quoting Paul Morand, argued should be studied within a global \"sphere.\"\n\n1.  **Analyze the prompt:** The question centers on the work of the historian Fernand Braudel and his emphasis on a global perspective. He used a quote from Paul Morand to illustrate his point. The key is to identify the \"conceptual entity\" that, like a nation, is a primary unit of study but must be understood within a broader context (a \"sphere\").\n2.  **Recall Braudel's core concepts:** Braudel is famous for moving the focus of history away from short-term political events and the nation-state. His main units of analysis were vast, long-lasting structures. The two most prominent are \"world-economies\" (`économies-monde`) and \"civilizations.\"\n3.  **Evaluate the options:** The entity is described as being \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation,\" meaning it serves a similar role as the primary subject of historical inquiry that the nation did for 19th-century historians. Braudel argued that history should focus on broader entities.\n4.  **Identify the best fit:** While \"world-economy\" is a key Braudelian concept, \"Civilization\" is a broader term he used to encompass not just economic ties but also cultural, social, and psychological frameworks that define a large human group over the *longue durée* (long term). In his major work, *A History of Civilizations*, he explicitly defines civilization as the ideal subject for this new, broader type of historical study. It is this entity that must be \"inscribed within a sphere\" of global history.\n5.  **Plan the code:** Since this is a knowledge-based question, the code will simply store the answer in a variable and then print it to the console, fulfilling the format requirement.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the conceptual entity from the historical philosophy of Fernand Braudel.\n# The user's question references Braudel's argument, supported by a quote from Paul Morand,\n# that the primary subject of history should not be the nation-state alone but a larger entity\n# viewed within a global \"sphere\".\n# In Braudel's work, this broader unit of study, which encompasses long-term cultural, social,\n# and economic structures, is \"Civilization\".\n\n# Define the conceptual entity.\nconceptual_entity = \"Civilization\"\n\n# Print the answer to the console.\nprint(conceptual_entity)\n```\n<<<Civilization>>>"
