# This script identifies the conceptual entity from the historical philosophy of Fernand Braudel.
# The user's question references Braudel's argument, supported by a quote from Paul Morand,
# that the primary subject of history should not be the nation-state alone but a larger entity
# viewed within a global "sphere".
# In Braudel's work, this broader unit of study, which encompasses long-term cultural, social,
# and economic structures, is "Civilization".

# Define the conceptual entity.
conceptual_entity = "Civilization"
