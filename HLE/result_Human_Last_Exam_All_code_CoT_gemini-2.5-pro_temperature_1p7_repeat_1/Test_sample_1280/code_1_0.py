    Let's see how the eigenstates of H_0 and H_1 are related.
    
    1. Mapping from H_0 to H_1:
    Let psi_0 be an eigenstate of H_0 with eigenvalue E.
    H_0 * psi_0 = E * psi_0
    (L^+L - alpha) * psi_0 = E * psi_0  =>  L^+L * psi_0 = (E + alpha) * psi_0
    
    Now, let's apply the operator L to this equation and see what happens to the state (L * psi_0):
    L * (L^+L * psi_0) = L * (E + alpha) * psi_0
    (L * L^+) * (L * psi_0) = (E + alpha) * (L * psi_0)
    
    Let's define a new state, psi_1 = L * psi_0. The equation becomes:
    (L * L^+) * psi_1 = (E + alpha) * psi_1
    
    Since H_1 = L*L^+ - alpha, we can write L*L^+ = H_1 + alpha. Substituting this in:
    (H_1 + alpha) * psi_1 = (E + alpha) * psi_1
    H_1 * psi_1 = E * psi_1
    
    This shows that if psi_0 is an eigenstate of H_0 with energy E, then psi_1 = L * psi_0 is an eigenstate of H_1 with the *same energy E*. This holds true as long as psi_1 is not zero.

    print("-----------------------------------")
    explanation = """
    The mapping fails if L * psi_0 = 0. What is the energy of such a state?
    We go back to the H_0 eigenvalue equation:
    (L^+L - alpha) * psi_0 = E * psi_0
    
    If L * psi_0 = 0, this simplifies to:
    L^+(0) - alpha * psi_0 = E * psi_0
    -alpha * psi_0 = E * psi_0
    So, E = -alpha.
    
    This means that if there exists a normalizable state psi_0 such that L * psi_0 = 0, this state is an eigenstate of H_0 with energy -alpha. This state does not have a partner in the spectrum of H_1 because the mapping procedure gives zero.
    
    A symmetric argument holds for H_1. An eigenstate psi_1 of H_1 annihilated by L^+ (i.e., L^+ * psi_1 = 0) would be an unpaired eigenstate of H_1 with energy E = -alpha.

    # Step 3: Non-degeneracy and Conclusion
    print("Conclusion")
    print("----------")
    explanation = """
    A fundamental result from Sturm-Liouville theory states that for a one-dimensional Schr√∂dinger operator on a finite interval (like H_0 and H_1 on [0,1]), the energy eigenvalues are non-degenerate.
    
    This implies:
    1. There can be at most one state (up to normalization) that satisfies L * psi_0 = 0.
    2. There can be at most one state that satisfies L^+ * psi_1 = 0.
    
    Furthermore, in supersymmetric quantum mechanics, it can be shown that at most one of these two potential unpaired states can be normalizable. It is not possible for both H_0 and H_1 to have an unpaired state.
    
    Therefore, the spectra of H_0 and H_1 are almost identical. All energy levels are paired and have the same value, with the possible exception of a single, non-degenerate level at energy E = -alpha that may exist in one spectrum but not the other.
