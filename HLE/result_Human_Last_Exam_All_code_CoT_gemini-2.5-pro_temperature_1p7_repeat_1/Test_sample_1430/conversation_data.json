    "To find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Jacobian of C**:\n    The object $X = C^{(15)}$ is the 15th symmetric power of the curve $C$. For a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$ and its $d$-th symmetric power $C^{(d)}$, there's a fundamental relationship between their Picard numbers (the rank of the Néron-Severi group). When the degree $d$ is large enough, specifically for $d \\geq 2g-1$, the formula is:\n    $$ \\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1 $$\n    where $J(C)$ is the Jacobian of the curve $C$.\n\n2.  **Verify the Condition**:\n    In this problem, the genus is $g=3$ and the degree is $d=15$. We check the condition:\n    $$ 2g-1 = 2(3) - 1 = 5 $$\n    Since $d=15 \\geq 5$, the formula applies. Our task is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve.\n\n3.  **Determine the Smallest Rank of NS(J(C))**:\n    The Jacobian $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. The Néron-Severi group of any abelian variety has a rank of at least 1. The minimum rank is achieved for a *generic* curve. A generic curve $C$ of genus $g$ is one for which its Jacobian $J(C)$ has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, which is just the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is:\n    $$ \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 $$\n\n4.  **Determine the Largest Rank of NS(J(C))**:\n    The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a $g$-dimensional abelian variety is bounded by the dimension of its space of Hodge classes of type (1,1), which is $h^{1,1} = g^2$. For our genus $g=3$ Jacobian, this gives an upper bound:\n    $$ \\rho(J(C)) \\leq g^2 = 3^2 = 9 $$\n    This maximum rank is achieved when the Jacobian has complex multiplication (CM) to the fullest extent possible. This occurs, for example, if $J(C)$ is isogenous to the product of three isogenous CM elliptic curves. A concrete example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian achieves this maximum is the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. For such a curve, we have:\n    $$ \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9 $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ranks for X**:\n    Now, we use the formula from Step 1 to find the smallest and largest ranks for $X = C^{(15)}$.\n\n    *   **Smallest Rank**: $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n    *   **Largest Rank**: $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints these final values.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3 # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # The symmetric power\n\n    # The problem reduces to finding the min and max rank of the Neron-Severi group of J(C).\n    # For a generic genus 3 curve, the rank is minimal.\n    rho_min_J = 1\n\n    # For a special curve with maximal complex multiplication (e.g., the Fermat quartic),\n    # the rank is maximal and equals g^2.\n    rho_max_J = g**2\n\n    # The formula for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(d) for d >= 2g-1 is\n    # rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1.\n    # Here, 15 >= 2*3 - 1 = 5, so the formula applies.\n\n    # Smallest possible rank\n    smallest_rank = rho_min_J + 1\n    \n    # Largest possible rank\n    largest_rank = rho_max_J + 1\n\n    print(\"To find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15),\")\n    print(\"we use the formula rho(C^(d)) = rho(J(C)) + 1, valid for d >= 2g - 1.\")\n    print(f\"Here, g = {g}, d = {d}, and d >= 2*g - 1 holds since {d} >= {2*g - 1}.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Find the minimum and maximum rho(J(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\")\n    print(f\"The minimum rank for J(C) of a generic curve is: {rho_min_J}\")\n    print(f\"The maximum rank for J(C) of a special CM curve is g^2 = {g}^2 = {rho_max_J}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the ranks for X.\")\n    print(f\"Smallest rank of NS(X) = rho_min(J(C)) + 1 = {rho_min_J} + 1 = {smallest_rank}\")\n    print(f\"Largest rank of NS(X) = rho_max(J(C)) + 1 = {rho_max_J} + 1 = {largest_rank}\")\n\n    # Return the final computed values for the submission format\n    return smallest_rank, largest_rank\n\nsmallest, largest = solve_neron_severi_rank()\n\n# The final answer format is not explicitly requested here, but if it were just the numbers:\n# <<<[2, 10]>>> or something similar.\n# The user asked me to be a helpful assistant, so I will provide the final answer as requested in the prompt style.\nfinal_answer = f\"The smallest rank is {smallest} and the largest rank is {largest}.\"\n```\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
