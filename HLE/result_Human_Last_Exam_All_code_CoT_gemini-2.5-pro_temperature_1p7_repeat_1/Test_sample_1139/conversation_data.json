    "To determine the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables for the specified supersymmetric sigma-model, we need to calculate the dimension of the bosonic part of the model's target manifold.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Manifold:** For a supersymmetric sigma-model describing disordered systems of symmetry class D with `n` replicas, the target manifold (the space of Goldstone modes) is the symmetric superspace `G/K`, where `G = OSp(4n|4n)` and `K = OSp(2n|2n) x OSp(2n|2n)`. The parameter `n` corresponds to the number of replicas, which is given as 2.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bosonic Submanifold:** The non-Grassman variables parametrize the bosonic part of this target manifold, which is given by the quotient of the corresponding bosonic subgroups, `G_b/K_b`. The dimension of this manifold is `dim(G_b) - dim(K_b)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Bosonic Subgroups:** The bosonic subgroup of the orthosymplectic supergroup `OSp(2p|2q)` is `Sp(2p, R) x SO(2q)`.\n    *   For `G = OSp(4n|4n)`, the bosonic subgroup is `G_b = Sp(4n, R) x SO(4n)`.\n    *   For `K = OSp(2n|2n) x OSp(2n|2n)`, the bosonic subgroup is `K_b = [Sp(2n, R) x SO(2n)] x [Sp(2n, R) x SO(2n)]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Dimensions:** We will use the following standard dimension formulas for the matrix groups:\n    *   Dimension of the real symplectic group `Sp(2p, R)`: `p(2p + 1)`\n    *   Dimension of the special orthogonal group `SO(m)`: `m(m - 1) / 2`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Result:** By substituting `n=2` into these formulas, we will calculate `dim(G_b)` and `dim(K_b)` and then find their difference. This difference gives the total number of bosonic variables.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Number of replicas as specified in the problem\nn = 2\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic subgroup G_b = Sp(4n, R) x SO(4n)\n\n# For Sp(4n, R), the parameter in the formula dim(Sp(2p,R)) is p = 2n\np_g = 2 * n\n# For SO(4n), the parameter in the formula dim(SO(m)) is m = 4n\nm_g = 4 * n\n\n# Calculate dimension of each part\ndim_sp_g = p_g * (2 * p_g + 1)\ndim_so_g = m_g * (m_g - 1) // 2\n\n# Total dimension of G_b\ndim_g_b = dim_sp_g + dim_so_g\n\nprint(f\"For n={n}:\")\nprint(f\"The group G = OSp({2*m_g}|{2*m_g})\")\nprint(f\"The bosonic subgroup G_b = Sp({2*p_g}, R) x SO({m_g})\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of G_b = dim(Sp({2*p_g}, R)) + dim(SO({m_g})) = {dim_sp_g} + {dim_so_g} = {dim_g_b}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic subgroup K_b = [Sp(2n, R) x SO(2n)] x [Sp(2n, R) x SO(2n)]\n\n# First, find the dimension of one factor, Sp(2n, R) x SO(2n)\n# For Sp(2n, R), p = n\np_k = n\n# For SO(2n), m = 2n\nm_k = 2 * n\n\n# Calculate dimension of each part of the factor\ndim_sp_k = p_k * (2 * p_k + 1)\ndim_so_k = m_k * (m_k - 1) // 2\n\n# Dimension of one factor of K_b\ndim_k_b_factor = dim_sp_k + dim_so_k\n\n# Total dimension of K_b is twice the dimension of one factor\ndim_k_b = 2 * dim_k_b_factor\n\nprint(f\"The subgroup K = OSp({2*m_k}|{2*m_k}) x OSp({2*m_k}|{2*m_k})\")\nprint(f\"The bosonic subgroup K_b = [Sp({2*p_k}, R) x SO({m_k})] x [Sp({2*p_k}, R) x SO({m_k})]\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of one factor of K_b = dim(Sp({2*p_k}, R)) + dim(SO({m_k})) = {dim_sp_k} + {dim_so_k} = {dim_k_b_factor}\")\nprint(f\"Total dimension of K_b = 2 * {dim_k_b_factor} = {dim_k_b}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final number of non-Grassman variables\nnum_variables = dim_g_b - dim_k_b\n\nprint(\"Final Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Number of non-Grassman variables = dim(G_b) - dim(K_b)\")\nprint(f\"The number of variables is {dim_g_b} - {dim_k_b} = {num_variables}\")\n```\n<<<32>>>"
