    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group Structure:** The generalized quaternion group $Q_{2^n}$ has order $2^n$. For size 128, we have $128 = 2^7$, so we are dealing with $Q_{2^7}$ (where $n=7$).\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be written as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of unique subgroups that can be formed this way.\n3.  **Use Group Properties to Find the Subgroups:** It is a known result from group theory that for a generalized quaternion group $Q_{2^n}$, the set of all power subgroups consists of exactly $n$ distinct subgroups. These are $Q_{2^n}$ itself, the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$, and $n-2$ distinct cyclic subgroups generated by powers of one of the generators.\n4.  **Calculate n:** For $Q_{128}$, we have $2^n = 128$. We can find $n$ by taking the base-2 logarithm of 128, i.e., $n = \\log_2(128)$.\n5.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script that calculates $n$ from the group size 128 and prints the result, showing the equation used as requested.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups for $Q_{128}$ are $Q_{128}$, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, and $\\{1\\}$, where $x$ is a generator of order 64. There are 7 such subgroups.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The size of the generalized quaternion group is N.\n    group_size = 128\n    \n    # For a generalized quaternion group Q_N = Q_{2^n}, the number of power subgroups is n.\n    # We find n by solving the equation N = 2^n, which means n = log2(N).\n    \n    if group_size <= 4 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: A generalized quaternion group Q_{group_size} is only defined for group_size being a power of 2, and group_size >= 8.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate n = log2(group_size)\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n    \n    # The number of power subgroups is n.\n    num_power_subgroups = n\n    \n    # Output the final equation and the result.\n    # The equation is log2(group_size) = n\n    print(f\"For the generalized quaternion group of size {group_size}:\")\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups is given by 'n' where {group_size} = 2^n.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"log2({group_size}) = {num_power_subgroups}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThus, there are {num_power_subgroups} power subgroups.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
