    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we can perform a systematic search for the values of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$. Since the order of the variables matters (e.g., $(1, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ is different from $(0, 1, 0, 0, 0)$), we are looking for the number of ordered tuples.\n\nA direct brute-force approach iterating through all possible values for each variable would be computationally expensive. The maximum value for any $x_i$ is $\\lfloor\\sqrt{2024}\\rfloor = 44$. A search space of $45^5$ is too large.\n\nA more efficient method is to find unique sets of solutions first and then calculate their permutations. We can enforce an order on the variables, say $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$, to find each unique set of numbers exactly once.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Use five nested loops to iterate through possible values for $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$ under the constraint $44 \\ge x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$.\n2.  The loops are structured to significantly prune the search space. For example, the loop for $x_2$ will only go up to the current value of $x_1$.\n3.  For each combination of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, we calculate the required value for $x_5^2$ as $2024 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2)$.\n4.  We then check if this remainder is a perfect square. If it is, we find $x_5$.\n5.  If we find a valid integer $x_5$, we check if it satisfies the ordering, i.e., $x_5 \\le x_4$. If it does, we have found a unique non-increasing solution set $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$.\n6.  For each unique solution set found, we calculate the number of distinct ordered tuples that can be formed by permuting its elements. This is given by the multinomial coefficient formula: $\\frac{5!}{c_1! c_2! \\dots c_k!}$, where $c_i$ are the counts of the unique values in the set.\n7.  We sum up the number of permutations for all unique solution sets to get the total count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will also print each unique solution set found, showing how its components sum to 2024 and how many distinct permutations it contributes to the final count.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_sum_of_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = 2024.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    num_vars = 5\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    \n    unique_solutions = []\n    \n    for x1 in range(limit + 1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        if s1 > target:\n            break\n        for x2 in range(x1 + 1):\n            s2 = s1 + x2 * x2\n            if s2 > target:\n                break\n            for x3 in range(x2 + 1):\n                s3 = s2 + x3 * x3\n                if s3 > target:\n                    break\n                for x4 in range(x3 + 1):\n                    s4 = s3 + x4 * x4\n                    if s4 > target:\n                        break\n                    \n                    rem = target - s4\n                    if rem < 0:\n                        continue\n                        \n                    x5 = int(math.sqrt(rem))\n                    \n                    if x5 * x5 == rem:\n                        if x5 <= x4:\n                            solution = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n                            unique_solutions.append(solution)\n\n    total_solutions = 0\n    print(f\"Finding non-negative integer solutions for x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = {target}:\\n\")\n    \n    if not unique_solutions:\n        print(\"No solutions found.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Unique solution sets (in non-increasing order) and their contributions:\")\n        for s in unique_solutions:\n            counts = Counter(s)\n            \n            numerator = math.factorial(num_vars)\n            denominator = 1\n            for count in counts.values():\n                denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n            \n            permutations = numerator // denominator\n            total_solutions += permutations\n            \n            # Print the equation for each solution\n            equation_str_parts = [f\"{val}^2\" for val in s]\n            equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_str_parts)\n            \n            values_str_parts = [f\"{val*val}\" for val in s]\n            values_str = \" + \".join(values_str_parts)\n\n            print(f\"Solution: ({', '.join(map(str, s))})\")\n            print(f\"  {equation_str} = {values_str} = {target}\")\n            print(f\"  Number of permutations: {permutations}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Total number of non-negative integer solutions: {total_solutions}\")\n\nsolve_sum_of_squares()\n<<<4560>>>\n```"
