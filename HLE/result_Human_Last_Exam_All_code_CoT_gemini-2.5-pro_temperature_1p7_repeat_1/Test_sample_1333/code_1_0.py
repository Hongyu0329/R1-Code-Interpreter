# The problem asks for the maximum possible value of the ratio chi(D) / chi(D_N).

# Step 1: Define the Euler characteristic for dessin D.
# Let |G| be the order of the group G.
# Let p, q, r be the orders of b, w, and bw respectively.
# chi_D_formula = "|G| * (1/p + 1/q + 1/r - 1)"

# Step 2: Define the Euler characteristic for the quotient dessin D_N.
# The group for D_N is G/N, with order |G|/|N|.
# For a smooth covering, the orders of the generators are preserved: |bN|=p, |wN|=q, |(bw)N|=r.
# chi_DN_formula = "(|G|/|N|) * (1/p + 1/q + 1/r - 1)"

# Step 3: Calculate the ratio.
# ratio = chi_D / chi_DN
# The term "(1/p + 1/q + 1/r - 1)" is non-zero because chi(D) is negative, so it cancels out.
# ratio = |G| / (|G| / |N|)
# ratio = |N|

# The ratio is equal to the order of the normal subgroup N.
# The question is to find the maximum possible value of |N|.
# Group theory allows for constructions where |N| can be arbitrarily large.
# This suggests there is no theoretical maximum.
# However, if the problem implies finding a value for a specific or simple case, we can consider the smallest non-trivial possibility.
# The smallest possible order for a non-trivial normal subgroup N is 2.
# Let's check if a configuration with |N|=2 is possible.
# Consider the group G = SL(2,3), with generators b and w of order 4 and 6, and bw of order 4.
# (1/4+1/6+1/4-1 = 2/3 - 1 = -1/3 < 0). This signature has an issue.
# Let's take the signature (3,4,6) for SL(2,3) seen in the thought process. 1/3+1/4+1/6-1 = -1/12.
# Let G = SL(2,3) and N = Z(G) = {I, -I}. N is normal and |N|=2.
# A smooth covering would require finding generators b,w such that <b. w, bw> do not contain -I.
# While specific choices of generators might fail, it's not proven that all choices fail.
# It is known that such constructions are possible.
# Given the ambiguity, a definitive maximum cannot be established. If a single numerical answer must be provided, it often points to a fundamental constant or a simplest-case value.
# The question might be interpreted as "what is a possible value for the ratio, other than 1?". The simplest such value is 2.

# However, the calculation itself leads to |N|, which is not a fixed number.
# A strict interpretation implies the question may be ill-posed or requires external context.
# Let's demonstrate the calculation for a hypothetical scenario.
