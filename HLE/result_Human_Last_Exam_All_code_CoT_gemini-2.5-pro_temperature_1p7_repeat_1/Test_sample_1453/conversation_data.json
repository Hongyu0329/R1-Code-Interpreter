    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we will analyze the residues at the core hydrophobic positions of the heptad repeat. The identity and packing of these residues are the primary determinants of the number of helices that assemble.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Heptad Repeat:** The standard coiled-coil structure is based on a seven-residue repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The core of the structure is formed by the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions. We will map the given sequence onto this repeat pattern.\n2.  **Analyze Core Residues:** We will identify which amino acids are at the 'a' and 'd' positions. The size, shape, and chemical properties (hydrophobic, polar, charged) of these residues dictate how the helices can pack together efficiently in a \"knobs-into-holes\" model.\n3.  **Predict Oligomeric State:** Based on established principles of coiled-coil design:\n    *   Large hydrophobic residues (like L, I) at 'a' and 'd' typically form dimers or trimers.\n    *   Small residues (like A) at the core lead to under-packing in lower-order oligomers, often favoring higher-order structures (tetramers and above) where helices can pack more closely.\n    *   Charged residues (like K) at the core are highly destabilizing unless the structure forms a large, central, water-filled channel, which is a hallmark of pentamers, hexamers, and higher-order oligomers.\n4.  **Synthesize Conclusion:** We will combine the analysis of the 'a' and 'd' positions to make a final prediction.\n\nThe following Python script automates this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n\n    The prediction is based on the identity of the residues at the core 'a' and 'd'\n    positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing Protein Sequence:\", sequence)\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the 'a' and 'd' position residues\n    heptad_positions = \"abcdefg\"\n    a_residues = []\n    d_residues = []\n\n    # Assign residues to heptad positions, assuming the sequence starts at 'a'\n    for i, residue in enumerate(sequence):\n        pos = heptad_positions[i % 7]\n        if pos == 'a':\n            a_residues.append(residue)\n        elif pos == 'd':\n            d_residues.append(residue)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying core residues based on a heptad (abcdefg) repeat.\")\n    print(f\"Residues at core 'a' positions: {', '.join(a_residues)}\")\n    print(f\"Residues at core 'd' positions: {', '.join(d_residues)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the properties of the core residues\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing core residues for packing efficiency.\")\n\n    # Analysis of 'd' positions\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis of 'd' positions:\")\n    print(f\"The 'd' positions are consistently occupied by Alanine (A).\")\n    print(\"Alanine is a small amino acid.

Placing a charge in the non-polar core of a coiled-coil is highly unfavorable due to electrostatic repulsion and the energy cost of desolvation. This is only tolerated if the helices arrange to form a wide, central pore that can be filled with water, which stabilizes the charges. Such a feature is characteristic of pentamers and hexamers.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude the oligomeric state\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion based on combined analysis.\")\n    print(\"The combination of small residues (Alanine) at all 'd' positions and charged residues (Lysine) at most 'a' positions is a well-known motif that strongly promotes the formation of a five-helix bundle, or a pentamer.\")\n    print(\"This arrangement allows for efficient packing while creating a stable, central, water-filled channel lined by the charged Lysine side chains.\")\n\n    final_answer = 5\n    print(\"\\nPredicted Oligomeric State:\", final_answer)\n\n\n# The protein sequence to be analyzed\nprotein_sequence = \"GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\"\npredict_oligomeric_state(protein_sequence)\n\n<<<D>>>\n```"
