# The problem asks for the variance of Y, Var(Y), which is given by the formula:
# Var(Y) = E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2.
# We will calculate E[Y] and E[Y^2] step by step.

# --- Step 1: Calculate the expected value E[Y] ---
# Due to the symmetry of the U[0, 1] distribution, the expected value of Y,
# which is the second closest point to X1, is the center of the interval, 1/2.
E_Y = Fraction(1, 2)
print(f"Step 1: The expected value E[Y] is found by symmetry.")
print(f"E[Y] = {E_Y.numerator}/{E_Y.denominator}")
print("-" * 40)

# --- Step 2: Calculate the expected value of Y squared, E[Y^2] ---
# The calculation of E[Y^2] involves integrating the conditional expectation E[Y^2|X_1=x]
# over the distribution of X1.
# The result of the derivation is E[Y^2] = 2 * integral from 0 to 1/2 of (3/10 - 6x^4 + 64/5 x^5) dx.
# First, we find the antiderivative F(x) = (3/10)x - (6/5)x^5 + (32/15)x^6.
# Then, we evaluate F(1/2) - F(0).
x = Fraction(1, 2)
term1_coeff = Fraction(3, 10)
term2_coeff = Fraction(-6, 5)
term3_coeff = Fraction(32, 15)

# Evaluate the antiderivative at x=1/2 (since F(0)=0)
integral_val = term1_coeff * x + term2_coeff * (x**5) + term3_coeff * (x**6)

# The value of E[Y^2] is twice the integral's value
E_Y_sq = 2 * integral_val

print(f"Step 2: E[Y^2] is calculated via integration.")
print(f"E[Y^2] = 2 * (Integral from 0 to 1/2) = 2 * ({integral_val.numerator}/{integral_val.denominator}) = {E_Y_sq.numerator}/{E_Y_sq.denominator}")
print("-" * 40)

# --- Step 3: Calculate the variance Var(Y) ---
# Now we substitute the values of E[Y] and E[Y^2] into the variance formula.
E_Y_val_sq = E_Y**2
variance = E_Y_sq - E_Y_val_sq

print(f"Step 3: The variance is calculated using Var(Y) = E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2.")
# Print out each number in the final equation
print(f"The final calculation is:")
print(f"Var(Y) = {E_Y_sq.numerator} / {E_Y_sq.denominator} - {E_Y_val_sq.numerator} / {E_Y_val_sq.denominator} = {variance.numerator} / {variance.denominator}")
