    "Yes, it follows that $f = 0$.\n\nMy plan is to use the properties of the Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions. The strategy is to translate the given condition on the moments of $f(x)$ into a condition on its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$. From there, I will use a key property of Schwartz functions to show that $\\hat{f}$ must be the zero function, which in turn implies that $f$ itself must be the zero function.\n\nHere is the step-by-step argument presented as a Python script that prints the explanation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_math_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step solution to the mathematical problem.\n    The problem is: Given a Schwartz function f such that all its moments are zero,\n    does it follow that f is the zero function?\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The answer to the question is YES.
