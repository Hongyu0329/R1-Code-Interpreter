    "To solve this problem, we need to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. This space is diffeomorphic to the Grassmannian of $2$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, denoted as $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. We will work with $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ as it simplifies the indexing of characteristic classes. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Cohomology Theory:** The integral cohomology ring of a real Grassmannian, $H^*(G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n); \\mathbb{Z})$, contains a torsion part which is an elementary abelian 2-group (meaning every torsion element has order 2). The rank of this torsion subgroup can be determined using the Bockstein homomorphism. The rank of the torsion subgroup in degree $i+1$, denoted $\\text{rank}(T^{i+1})$, is equal to the rank of the Steenrod square operator $Sq^1$ mapping from the mod 2 cohomology group in degree $i$ to degree $i+1$.\n    $$ \\text{rank}(T^{i+1}) = \\text{rank}(Sq^1: H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to H^{i+1}(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)) $$\n    The total rank of the torsion subgroup is the sum of these ranks over all degrees.\n\n3.  **Mod 2 Cohomology Ring:** The mod 2 cohomology ring $H^*(G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is a polynomial ring in the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1, \\dots, w_k$ of the tautological bundle, subject to certain relations. For $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the ring is $H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2[w_1, w_2]/I$, where $w_i \\in H^i$ and the ideal $I$ is generated by the Stiefel-Whitney classes $\\bar{w}_j$ of the normal bundle for $j > n-k=3$. The primary relations are $\\bar{w}_4=0$ and $\\bar{w}_5=0$. These can be expressed in terms of $w_1$ and $w_2$ as:\n    *   $\\bar{w}_4 = w_1^4 + w_1^2 w_2 + w_2^2 = 0$\n    *   From the relations, one can also derive $w_1^3 w_2 = 0$.\n    The dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ are:\n    *   $\\dim H^0=1$: basis $\\{1\\}$\n    *   $\\dim H^1=1$: basis $\\{w_1\\}$\n    *   $\\dim H^2=2$: basis $\\{w_1^2, w_2\\}$\n    *   $\\dim H^3=2$: basis $\\{w_1^3, w_1w_2\\}$\n    *   $\\dim H^4=2$: basis $\\{w_1^2w_2, w_2^2\\}$\n    *   $\\dim H^5=1$: basis $\\{w_1w_2^2\\}$\n    *   $\\dim H^6=1$: basis $\\{w_2^3\\}$\n\n4.  **Action of $Sq^1$:** The action of $Sq^1$ on the generators is given by $Sq^1(w_1) = w_2$ and $Sq^1(w_2) = w_1w_2$. We use the Cartan formula $Sq^1(xy) = Sq^1(x)y + xSq^1(y)$ to compute its action on all elements.\n\n5.  **Compute Ranks:** We calculate the rank of the linear map $Sq^1: H^i \\to H^{i+1}$ for each $i$.\n    *   $Sq^1: H^0 \\to H^1$: $Sq^1(1) = 0$. Rank = 0.\n    *   $Sq^1: H^1 \\to H^2$: $Sq^1(w_1) = w_2 \\neq 0$. Rank = 1.\n    *   $Sq^1: H^2 \\to H^3$: $Sq^1(a w_1^2 + b w_2) = b w_1w_2$. The image is spanned by $w_1w_2$. Rank = 1.\n    *   $Sq^1: H^3 \\to H^4$: $Sq^1(a w_1^3 + b w_1w_2) = (a+b)w_1^2w_2 + b w_2^2$. This map is an isomorphism from a 2D space to a 2D space. Rank = 2.\n    *   $Sq^1: H^4 \\to H^5$: $Sq^1$ on the basis $\\{w_1^2w_2, w_2^2\\}$ is zero because $w_1^3w_2=0$ and $Sq^1(x^2)=0$. Rank = 0.\n    *   $Sq^1: H^5 \\to H^6$: $Sq^1(w_1w_2^2) = w_2^3 \\neq 0$. Rank = 1.\n\n6.  **Sum the Ranks:** The total rank of the torsion subgroup is the sum of these individual ranks.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the ranks of the torsion subgroups in each degree.\n# These ranks are calculated by finding the rank of the linear map\n# Sq^1: H^i(G_2(R^5); Z_2) -> H^{i+1}(G_2(R^5); Z_2) for i = 0 to 6.\n# Torsion rank in H^{i+1} is the rank of Sq^1 on H^i.\n\n# Torsion rank in H^0 is zero by definition.\nrank_T0 = 0\n# Torsion rank in H^1 is zero because H^0 has no torsion.
