    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Connectivity:** The connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced homomorphism on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n2.  **Analyze the Source Space:** Let $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. We will compute the connectivity of this space by breaking it down.\n    *   `conn(S^n) = n-1`\n    *   `conn(\\Omega X) = conn(X) - 1`\n    *   `conn(X \\wedge Y) = conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1`\n    *   `conn(\\Sigma X) = conn(X) + 1`\n3.  **Analyze the Target Space:** Let $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. We will compute its connectivity.\n    *   `S^m \\wedge S^n \\simeq S^{m+n}`\n4.  **Compare Connectivity:** The map $f_*$ will be an isomorphism $0 \\to 0$ for all dimensions $i$ up to the minimum connectivity of the two spaces. This will give us a lower bound for the connectivity of the map.\n5.  **Analyze the First Non-trivial Homotopy Groups:** We will compute $\\pi_k(A)$ and $\\pi_k(B)$ for the first dimension $k$ where they are not both zero. This will require the Hurewicz theorem and some basic facts about homotopy groups of spheres.\n6.  **Analyze the Map on the First Non-trivial Homotopy Group:** We will analyze the homomorphism $f_*: \\pi_k(A) \\to \\pi_k(B)$. The behavior of this map (whether it's surjective) will determine the connectivity. This requires identifying the map $f$ with a known construction in homotopy theory (related to Samelson and Whitehead products) and using known results about this construction.\n    * The map $f$ is identified as the composition `$(\\Omega p) \\circ S$`, where $S$ is the Samelson product map and $p$ is the pinch map $S^4 \\vee S^6 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n    * A key result is that the Samelson product on the lowest dimension corresponds to the Whitehead product.\n    * Another key result is that the pinch map annihilates the Whitehead product.\n\nThis step-by-step calculation will lead to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Step-by-step Calculation ###\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Connectivity of S^4 and S^6\n    conn_s4 = 4 - 1\n    conn_s6 = 6 - 1\n    print(f\"1.
