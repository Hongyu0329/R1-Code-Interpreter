# The problem asks for the value of MG - MH in terms of MA and MB.
#
# Our derivation, based on the symmetry of the problem, shows that this value is constant.
# Let the desired expression be `f(CD, EF) = MG - MH`.
# The chords CD and EF are arbitrary chords through M.
# If we swap the labels of the chords, so we consider `f(EF, CD)`, the definitions of G and H are swapped.
#
# New G (G') comes from circ(E'MD') = circ(CMF), which defined the original H. So G' = H.
# New H (H') comes from circ(C'MF') = circ(EMD), which defined the original G. So H' = G.
#
# Therefore, f(EF, CD) = MG' - MH' = MH - MG = -(MG - MH) = -f(CD, EF).
# Since the result must be independent of the choice of chords, f(CD, EF) = f(EF, CD).
# The only way a value can equal its negative is if the value is 0.
# So, MG - MH = 0.

# The equation is MG - MH = 0.
# We print the numerical result as requested.
