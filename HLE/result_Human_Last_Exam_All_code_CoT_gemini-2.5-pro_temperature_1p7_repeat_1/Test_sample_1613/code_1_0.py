    Calculates the maximum possible number of children based on the geometric constraints.

    The problem can be solved by following these steps:
    1. A child's position P must be an intersection of two rays: P = Ray(E, Ti) ∩ Ray(F, Tj),
       where Ti and Tj are distinct trees from the set {A, B, C, D}.
    2. Such a ray intersection exists if and only if the line connecting the trees, Line(Ti, Tj),
       separates the unseen trees E and F. This is geometrically equivalent to Ti and Tj
       being on opposite sides of the line passing through E and F.
    3. To maximize the number of children, we must maximize the number of such separating lines.
       Let's say we place 'p' trees from {A, B, C, D} on one side of the line EF and '4-p' on the other.
    4. The number of lines connecting a tree from the first group to a tree from the second group is k = p * (4-p).
       We need to find the maximum value of k.
    5. The possible values for p are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
       - p=0 or p=4: k = 0 * 4 = 0
       - p=1 or p=3: k = 1 * 3 = 3
       - p=2: k = 2 * 2 = 4
    6. The maximum number of separating lines is k = 4.
    7. Each separating line Line(Ti, Tj) allows for TWO distinct child locations:
       - Ray(E, Ti) ∩ Ray(F, Tj)
       - Ray(E, Tj) ∩ Ray(F, Ti)
    8. Therefore, the maximum number of children is 2 * k.
