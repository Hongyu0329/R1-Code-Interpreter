    """
    Analyzes materials to find the optimum choice for a particle detector cooling system.

    The unique parameter for a particle detector compared to a spacecraft is the need
    to minimize interaction with the particles being measured. This is because the
    cooling system is inside the detector and in the path of the particles.
    Interactions (like scattering or energy loss) corrupt the measurement data.

    This "transparency" to particles is best quantified by the Radiation Length (Xâ‚€).
    A longer radiation length means less interaction. Therefore, the optimum material
    is the one with the maximum radiation length.
