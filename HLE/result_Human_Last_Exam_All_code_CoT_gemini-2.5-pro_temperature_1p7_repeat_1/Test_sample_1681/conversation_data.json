    "The problem asks for the equilibrium point of the prisoner's dilemma when played in a quantum setting. We are given a specific payoff matrix and are allowed to design the initial state for an optimal outcome. This suggests using the framework of quantum game theory, specifically the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme, which is a common and powerful model.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish the Quantum Game Framework:**\n    *   The state space is a two-qubit system, where `|0>` represents Cooperate (C) and `|1>` represents Defect (D). The basis states `|00>`, `|01>`, `|10>`, `|11>` correspond to the classical outcomes (C,C), (C,D), (D,C), and (D,D).\n    *   We will design an \"optimal\" initial state by using a maximal entanglement operator `J`. This operator links the two players' qubits. The game starts from a simple classical state, `|00>`, and is entangled by `J`.\n    *   Players' strategies (like Cooperate, Defect, or a pure Quantum move) are represented by unitary operators (matrices) `U_A` and `U_B`. They apply these operators to their respective qubits.\n    *   After the players' moves, the state is disentangled by applying the inverse of `J`, denoted `J†`. This transforms the quantum state back into a combination of classical outcomes that can be measured.\n    *   The full transformation is: `|ψ_final> = J† (U_A ⊗ U_B) J |00>`.\n2.  **Define Strategies and Payoffs:**\n    *   The classical strategies Cooperate (C) and Defect (D) are represented by the Identity matrix (`I`) and a Pauli-X flip (`σ_x`), respectively. A phase is often included, making `D = iσ_x`.\n    *   There exists a unique quantum strategy, `Q` (often represented by `iσ_z`), which acts as a \"miracle\" move.\n    *   The payoff for each player is calculated based on the probabilities of measuring the final state in each of the four classical outcomes, using the given payoff matrix:\n        *   (C, C) -> (5, 5)\n        *   (C, D) -> (0, 7)\n        *   (D, C) -> (7, 0)\n        *   (D, D) -> (1, 1)\n3.  **Calculate the Equilibrium:**\n    *   A Nash Equilibrium is a pair of strategies where neither player can improve their own payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n    *   We will demonstrate that the strategy pair `(Q, Q)` constitutes a Nash Equilibrium.\n    *   First, we'll calculate the payoff for both players when they both choose the quantum strategy `Q`. This is the equilibrium point.\n    *   Second, we'll show that if one player deviates (e.g., switches to `D`) while the other continues to play `Q`, their payoff will decrease, thus proving `(Q, Q)` is a stable equilibrium.\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   We will use the `numpy` library to perform the complex matrix and vector operations required for the calculations. The code will explicitly compute the final state and the resulting payoffs for the `(Q, Q)` equilibrium and a `(D, Q)` deviation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma\n    using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) framework.\n    \"\"\"\n    # -- 1.
