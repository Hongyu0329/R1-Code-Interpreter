    explanation = """
    The core issue is that the student's current method sequences transcripts from the 3' end (poly-A tail). The CDR3 region of a TCR transcript is located far from this end, closer to the 5' end of the mRNA molecule. A 225 bp sequencing read starting from the 3' end is not long enough to reach the CDR3 region.

    To solve this, a targeted approach is required to specifically isolate and sequence the V(D)J region containing the CDR3. Let's evaluate the options:

    - A is incorrect. A primer 'upstream' (5' side) of the V(D)J region would synthesize cDNA away from the CDR3, not through it. The primer should be 'downstream' (in the constant region).

    - B is incorrect. It describes the template switching mechanism inaccurately. The TSO is a separate oligo in the RT reaction, not part of the bead-bound oligo.

    - C is a possible but less common method. The standard approach for commercial systems like BD Rhapsody is to use universal beads and add specificity with primers in solution, which is more flexible than creating custom-modified beads.

    - D is the correct solution. It describes the standard workflow for single-cell V(D)J sequencing. After creating a library of all barcoded cDNAs, a targeted PCR is performed using primers specific to the TCR. One primer binds to the conserved constant region (downstream of CDR3) and another primer binds to the universal adapter at the other end. This specifically amplifies the V(D)J fragment, ensuring it gets sequenced. This is the strategy used in the BD Rhapsody V(D)J assay.

    - E is incorrect as it violates the problem's constraints and would make the problem worse.

    Therefore, the student should add a targeted PCR enrichment step to their existing protocol.
