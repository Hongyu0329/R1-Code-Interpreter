    "The bushu (radical) of a kanji character is a graphical component used to classify and look up the character in a dictionary. For the character 謄, the radical is located on the left side.\n\n1.  **Identify the character:** The character is 謄.\n2.  **Deconstruct the character:** 謄 is composed of two parts: 言 on the left and 朕 on the right.\n3.  **Identify the radical:** The radical is the part used for classification, which is 言 in this case.\n4.  **Find the name of the radical:** When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known as \"ごんべん\" (gonben).\n5.  **Transcribe the name to Hepburn:** The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\nHere is the Python code to print the answer.\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\n\ndef get_kanji_radical(character):\n    \"\"\"\n    Looks up the radical for a given Kanji character.\n    This is a simplified example with a predefined dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping Kanji to their radical's Hepburn name.\n    # The key is the kanji and the value is the Hepburn transcription of the radical name.\n    radical_map = {\n        '謄': 'Gonben', # 言偏 (gonben)\n        '媛': 'Onnahen', # 女偏 (onnahen)\n        '松': 'Kihen',   # 木偏 (kihen)\n        '海': 'Sanzui',  # さんずい (sanzui)\n        '河': 'Sanzui',  # さんずい (sanzui)\n        '聞': 'Mon',     # 門 (mon-gamae)\n    }\n\n    radical_name = radical_map.get(character)\n\n    if radical_name:\n        print(f\"The radical for the character '{character}' is '{radical_name}'.\")\n        return radical_name\n    else:\n        print(f\"Radical information for '{character}' not found in the dictionary.\")\n        return None\n\n# The target character\ntarget_character = '謄'\nfinal_answer = get_kanji_radical(target_character)\n# The final answer in the required format will be added after the code block.\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
