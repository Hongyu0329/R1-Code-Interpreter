    "My plan is to solve this problem by first analyzing the nature of the set of possible clique sizes within any graph.\n\n1.  **Analyze the set of clique sizes:** For any graph `G`, if it contains an induced clique of a certain size `k_max`, I will show that it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k_max`. This means the set of different clique sizes is always a contiguous set of integers starting from 1, i.e., `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`.\n2.  **Simplify the problem:** Based on the above, the number of different clique sizes is simply `k_max`, the size of the largest clique in the graph (also known as the clique number). The problem is therefore reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices.\n3.  **Find the maximum:** The maximum clique number for a graph with `n` vertices is `n`. This is achieved by the complete graph `K_n`, where all vertices are interconnected.\n4.  **Final code:** I will write a Python script that explains this reasoning step-by-step and prints the final result for n = 128.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single\n    graph on n = 128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step reasoning:\")\n    print(\"=======================\")\n\n    # Step 1: Characterize the set of possible clique sizes.\n    print(f\"1.
