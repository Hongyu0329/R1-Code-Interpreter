    print("\n2. Let k_max be the size of the largest clique in G (this is called the clique number, omega(G)).")
    print("   By definition, k_max is the largest number in the set S.")
    print("   If G has an induced clique of size k_max, there is a set of k_max vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in that set.")
    print("   If we take any subset of s vertices from this k_max-sized clique (where 1 <= s <= k_max), this subset also forms an induced clique of size s.")
    print("   This is because all vertices in the subset are still pairwise connected.")
    print("   Therefore, for every integer s from 1 to k_max, an induced clique of size s exists in G.")
    print("   This means the set S must be equal to {1, 2, 3, ..., k_max}.")

    # Step 3: Relate the number of sizes to the clique number.
    print(f"\n3. From the above, the number of different clique sizes, |S|, is simply k_max.")
    print("   So, the problem is now simplified to: What is the maximum possible value of k_max (the clique number) for a graph on 128 vertices?")

    # Step 4: Determine the maximum possible clique number.

    print(f"   Therefore, for any graph on n = {n} vertices, the clique number k_max must be less than or equal to {n}.")
    
    # Step 5: Construct a graph that achieves this maximum.
