    # --- Scenario 2: Black repositions the knight ---
    print("Scenario 2: Black plays 1... Nd7")

    print("\n   Explanation: White forces a knight trade and then activates the king by moving it to the dominant d4 square. From d4, White's king restricts the Black king and is perfectly placed to deal with Black's g-pawn. The a-pawn remains a decisive, game-winning threat.")

    print("   - Black's move: 1... Ke5")
    print("   - White's move: 2. Ne1")
    print("\n   Explanation: This is Black's trickiest reply, as it attacks White's knight on d3. White simply defends by moving the knight to e1. The threat of a8=Q remains. If Black tries for counterplay (e.g., ...Na4), White promotes the pawn anyway and will win material in all variations.")
