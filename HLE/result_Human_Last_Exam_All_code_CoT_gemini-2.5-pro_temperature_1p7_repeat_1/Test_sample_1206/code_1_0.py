    This function analyzes the medical counseling options for an adolescent vaping
    and determines the best course of action.

    The key points for counseling are:
    1.  Emphasize that vaping is not safe for adolescents due to unknown long-term risks
        and known negative effects of nicotine on the developing brain. This corresponds to option III.
    2.  Suggest approved cessation methods like Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT - patches, gum)
        as a safer alternative to manage withdrawal while quitting. This corresponds to option II.
    3.  Options that normalize or endorse vaping for adolescents (I, IV) are inappropriate.

    The combination of II and III provides a sound, evidence-based counseling strategy.
    This corresponds to answer choice J.
