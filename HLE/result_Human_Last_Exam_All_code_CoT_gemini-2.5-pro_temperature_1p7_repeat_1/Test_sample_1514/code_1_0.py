def solve_compactification_problem():
    """
    This function determines the smallest number of topologically distinct
    compactifications of the ray with a nondegenerate locally-connected
    compact metric space remainder.

    The problem is equivalent to finding the minimum number of "terminal continua"
    a space X with the given properties can have.

    1.  For any such space X, X itself is always a terminal continuum.
        This means the number of terminal continua is always at least 1.
    2.  We seek a space X that has exactly one terminal continuum.
    3.  Consider the circle, S^1. It is a non-degenerate, locally-connected,
        compact metric space.
    4.  The only terminal continuum in a circle is the circle itself. Any
        proper subcontinuum (a point or an arc) is not terminal.
    5.  Therefore, the circle S^1 has exactly 1 terminal continuum.

    This means the minimum number of such compactifications is 1.
