    # Let B be the number of C_6' (6-cycle with a chord) homomorphisms.
    # G is a d-regular graph on n vertices.
    
    # There's a known result in extremal graph theory (Alon, Shikhelman 2016)
    # relating the number of C_4 subgraphs to C_6' subgraphs.
    # The result for subgraph counts N(H) is:
    # N(C_4) = O(N(C_6') / d^1.5 + n*d^2)
    # The number of homomorphisms is proportional to the number of subgraphs,
    # so the same asymptotic relationship holds for A and B.
    # Let's call this the Core Inequality.
    # Core Inequality: A = O(B/d^1.5 + n*d^2)

    # Statement 1: A = O(B/d^0.5 + n*d^2)
    # For d >= 1, d^1.5 >= d^0.5, so 1/d^1.5 <= 1/d^0.5.
    # This implies B/d^1.5 <= B/d^0.5.
    # Therefore, B/d^1.5 + n*d^2 <= B/d^0.5 + n*d^2.
    # If A = O(B/d^1.5 + n*d^2), it is also O(B/d^0.5 + n*d^2).
    # This statement is a weaker form of the Core Inequality.

    # Statement 2: A = O(B/d^0.99 + n*d^2)
    # Similarly, for d >= 1, d^1.5 >= d^0.99, so 1/d^1.5 <= 1/d^0.99.
    # B/d^0.99 is a larger (or equal) term than B/d^1.5.
    # This statement is also a weaker form of the Core Inequality.

    # Statement 3: A = O(B/d + n*d^2)

    # Compare with the Core Inequality: A = O(B/d^1.5 + n*d^2)
    # For d >= 1, d^1.5 >= d^1.3 => 1/d^1.5 <= 1/d^1.3
    # For d >= 1, d^2.6 >= d^2
    # So, (B/d^1.5 + n*d^2) <= (B/d^1.3 + n*d^2.6)

    # Statement 6: A = O(B/d + n*d^1.5)
    # The second term, n*d^1.5, is asymptotically smaller than n*d^2 for large d.
    # This means the statement is not necessarily true. We can seek a counterexample.
    # Consider a family of d-regular graphs where B = 0, and d can be arbitrarily large.
    # Such graphs exist, for example, if the number of C4s containing any given edge is at most 1.
    # If B = 0, the Core Inequality states A = O(n*d^2).
    # If B = 0, Statement 6 claims A = O(n*d^1.5).
    # There are d-regular graphs for which A = Omega(n*d^2).
    # For such a graph, we would need n*d^2 = O(n*d^1.5), which implies d^0.5 = O(1).
    # This means d must be bounded by a constant.
    # However, the statement must hold for all d-regular graphs, including those with d -> infinity.
    # Therefore, we can find a counterexample.
