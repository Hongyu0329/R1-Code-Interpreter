    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of knot coloring, specifically Fox n-coloring. A knot diagram can be colored with a set of `n` colors (usually represented by the integers {0, 1, ..., n-1}) if at every crossing, the sum of the colors of the two under-crossing arcs is congruent to twice the color of the over-crossing arc, all modulo `n`.\n\nThe set of colors {0, 1, ..., n-1} with addition and multiplication modulo `n` forms an algebraic structure called the ring of integers modulo `n`, denoted as Z_n. A non-trivial coloring (one that uses more than one color) is possible if and only if `n` is a divisor of the knot's determinant.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of elements in an algebraic structure that allows a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is the smallest prime factor of its determinant. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Model the Knot**: I will represent the figure-eight knot's coloring relations as a system of linear equations. This system can be written as a coefficient matrix, known as the coloring matrix.\n2.  **Calculate the Knot Determinant**: The determinant of the knot is the absolute value of the determinant of any submatrix obtained by removing one row and one column from the coloring matrix. I will use Python's NumPy library for this calculation.\n3.  **Find the Smallest Coloring Number**: The result of the knot determinant is the number we're looking for. Since the determinant of the figure-eight knot is a prime number, this value itself is the smallest integer `n > 1` that allows for a non-trivial coloring. This number `n` is the size of the smallest algebraic structure, Z_n.\n4.  **Display the Calculation**: As requested, the code will explicitly print out the numbers and steps used in the determinant calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_knot_coloring():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the smallest algebraic structure for coloring the figure-eight knot.\n\n    This is determined by the knot's determinant.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The figure-eight knot has 4 arcs and 4 crossings.\n    # The relationships at each crossing (2 * over_arc - under_arc1 - under_arc2 = 0)\n    # yield a system of linear equations.
