    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Wavefunction and Probability Density**: The wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by `ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`. The probability density, which describes the likelihood of finding the particle at a given position `x`, is the square of the wavefunction: `P(x) = |ψn(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(nπx/a)`.\n\n2.  **Probability in an Interval**: To find the probability that the particle is located in a specific interval from `x1` to `x2`, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval: `P = ∫[from x1 to x2] P(x) dx`.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Values**:\n    *   The quantum state is `n = 2`.\n    *   The interval is from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n\n4.  **Setting up the Integral**: Substituting these values, the integral becomes:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a) dx`\n\n5.  **Simplification and Calculation**: To make the integral easier to solve, we can use a change of variables `u = x/a`. This simplifies the integral to be independent of the box length 'a', with new limits from `u1 = 0.495` to `u2 = 0.505`. The integral is then `P = ∫[from 0.495 to 0.505] 2 * sin^2(2πu) du`. We will use Python's `scipy` library to perform this numerical integration accurately.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    in a given interval for a specific quantum state n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the quantum state\n    n = 2\n\n    # Define the integration limits as a fraction of the box length 'a'\n    # u1 = x1/a and u2 = x2/a\n    u1 = 0.495\n    u2 = 0.505\n\n    # Define the probability density function for a box of length a=1\n    # P(u) = 2 * sin^2(n * pi * u)\n    def probability_density(u, n_level):\n        return 2 * (np.sin(n_level * np.pi * u))**2\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad\n    # The quad function returns the result of the integral and an error estimate.\n    probability, _ = quad(probability_density, u1, u2, args=(n,))\n\n    # Print the equation with the specific values used for the calculation\n    print(\"To find the probability, we solve the following integral:\")\n    print(f\"P = Integral from u1={u1} to u2={u2} of [2 * sin^2({n} * pi * u)] du\")\n    \n    # Print the final calculated probability\n    print(\"\\nThe result of the integration is:\")\n    print(f\"Probability = {probability}\")\n\nsolve_probability()\n<<<6.579736113481238e-06>>>\n```"
