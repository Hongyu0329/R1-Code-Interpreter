    Calculates the time it takes for a raindrop with accumulating mass to fall.

    The physical model for a raindrop accumulating mass as it falls leads to the
    surprising result that the raindrop experiences constant acceleration, a = g/7.
    The densities of the raindrop (rho) and the micro-droplets (Rho) cancel out
    during the derivation.

    The time 'T' to fall a distance 'h' under constant acceleration 'a' from rest is
    given by the kinematic equation: h = (1/2) * a * T^2, which means T = sqrt(2 * h / a).
