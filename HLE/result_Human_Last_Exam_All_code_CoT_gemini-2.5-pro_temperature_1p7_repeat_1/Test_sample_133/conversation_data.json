    "An optimal move is one that leads to a win in the shortest possible number of turns. I will analyze the board to find such moves for player 'O'.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Represent the Board**: I will convert the visual Connect 4 board into a 2D data structure (a list of lists) that my code can process.\n2.  **Check for Immediate Wins (Win in 1 Turn)**: I will first check if 'O' can win on this very turn. I will test placing an 'O' in each of the seven columns. If any of these placements result in four 'O's in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), that move is an optimal move.\n3.  **Check for Guaranteed Wins (Win in 3 Turns)**: If no immediate win exists, the next fastest way to win is to create a situation where the opponent is forced to block, but 'O' has more than one way to win on the subsequent turn. This is often called a \"fork\" or a \"double threat\". I will analyze each possible move for 'O' to see if it creates at least two separate, unblockable threats. For example, creating a line of three 'O's with open ends on both sides, like `_ O O O _`, is a double threat.\n4.  **Identify All Optimal Moves**: I will collect all moves that either win immediately or create a guaranteed win in the next turn.\n5.  **Format the Output**: Finally, I will format the identified move(s) into the requested `c4, f1, ...` format and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef solve_connect4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a Connect 4 board to find the optimal moves for player 'O'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Board setup: 6 rows, 7 columns.
