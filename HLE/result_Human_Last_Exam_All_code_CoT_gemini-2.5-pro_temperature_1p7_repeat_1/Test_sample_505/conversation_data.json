    "To determine the number of logical qubits, we need to understand how they are encoded in a surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the encoding:** The number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single, connected surface code is determined by its topology, specifically its genus (`g`, the number of \"handles\") and the number of boundaries or holes (`b`). The formula is `k = 2g + b - 1`.\n2.  **Apply to a single patch:** A \"patch\" of surface code is a planar surface, which means it has a genus of `g=0`. The problem states it has two holes, so `b=2`. We can use the formula to find the number of logical qubits in one patch.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** The problem specifies two such patches. Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n4.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will define these variables, perform the calculation for a single patch, then calculate the total for two patches, and print out the entire process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_surface_code_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given surface code configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of independent patches of the surface code\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes in each patch. Each hole acts as a boundary.\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n    \n    # A single \"patch\" of surface code is a planar surface, so its genus (g) is 0.\n    # The number of logical qubits (k) in a single patch is given by the formula:\n    # k = 2*g + b - 1, where g is the genus and b is the number of boundaries (holes).\n    # For a planar code (g=0), this simplifies to k = b - 1.\n    \n    # Calculate logical qubits for a single patch\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch - 1\n    \n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from each independent patch.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n    \n    print(\"This script calculates the number of logical qubits for the specified surface code setup.\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(f\"Number of patches: {num_patches}\")\n    print(f\"Number of holes per patch: {num_holes_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Calculate logical qubits for one patch.\")\n    print(\"The formula for a single planar patch with 'b' holes is: k = b - 1\")\n    print(f\"k_per_patch = {num_holes_per_patch} - 1 = {logical_qubits_per_patch}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate total logical qubits for all patches.\")\n    print(\"Total k = (k_per_patch) * (Number of patches)\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = {logical_qubits_per_patch} * {num_patches} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n    print(\"---\\n\")\n\nsolve_surface_code_qubits()\n<<<2>>>"
