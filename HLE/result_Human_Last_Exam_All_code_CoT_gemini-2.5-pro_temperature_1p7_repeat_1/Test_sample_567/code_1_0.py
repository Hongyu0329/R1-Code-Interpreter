# Plan:
# 1. The problem asks for the value of 'a' where the only obstruction to the symplectic
#    embedding of the ellipsoid E(1,a) into a ball B(sqrt(lambda)) is volume.
# 2. This condition is met when the embedding capacity function, c(a), equals the
#    lower bound derived from the volume constraint. This bound is sqrt(a).
# 3. According to key results in symplectic geometry, the equality c(a) = sqrt(a)
#    holds if and only if 'a' is a perfect square of an integer (a = m^2 for m >= 1).
# 4. The problem asks for a single value. The case m=1 gives a=1, which is a trivial
#    case (embedding a ball into a ball). We will provide the first non-trivial solution.
# 5. The first non-trivial solution corresponds to the integer m=2.

# Set m to the first non-trivial integer value
m = 2

# Calculate 'a' which is the square of m
a = m**2

# Print the final result, showing the equation used.

print(f"So, the value is: {a}")
