    "This is a question about population ethics, a branch of philosophy that deals with the moral value of causing people to exist. To answer it, we first need to understand the concepts involved.\n\n**1. Critical-Level Views:**\nA critical-level view is a way of evaluating the goodness of a population. It says that adding a new person to the world is only a good thing if their quality of life (or welfare) is above a certain positive \"critical level.\"\n*   If a person's welfare `w` is **above** the critical level `c`, adding them makes the world better. The value they add is `w - c`.\n*   If a person's welfare `w` is **below** the critical level `c` (but still positive, meaning their life is worth living), adding them makes the world *worse*.\n*   If `w = c`, adding them makes no difference to the world's value.\n\n**2. Non-Elitism Condition:**\nThe Non-Elitism condition essentially states that quantity can eventually make up for quality. More formally: for any life that is worth living (i.e., has positive welfare), no matter how low, a large enough population of such people is better than any population of a limited number of people with extremely high welfare. It prevents a theory from being \"elitist\" by always favoring a small number of extremely happy people over a vast number of moderately happy people.\n\n**3. The Violation:**\nCritical-level views violate Non-Elitism. If we choose a welfare level `w` that is positive but *below* the critical level `c`, then each person we add with this welfare level contributes a negative value (`w - c`). Therefore, adding more and more of these people will only make the total population value more and more negative. Such a population can never be better than a population of even one person whose welfare is high enough to be above the critical level.\n\nI will write a Python script to demonstrate this conflict. The script will:\n1.  Define a function to calculate a population's value using a critical-level view.\n2.  Set up two populations:\n    *   **Population A:** A small \"elite\" population with a very high quality of life.\n    *   **Population B:** A very large \"non-elite\" population where each person has a life that is worth living (positive welfare) but is below the critical level.\n3.  Calculate and compare the total value of these two populations to show that Population B is not, and can never be, better than Population A, thus violating Non-Elitism.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_critical_level_value(population_welfares, critical_level):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of a population according to a critical-level view.\n    'population_welfares' is a list of welfare levels for each person.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not population_welfares:\n        return 0\n    \n    total_value = sum(welfare - critical_level for welfare in population_welfares)\n    return total_value\n\n# --- Setup the Scenario ---\n# 1. Define the critical level. A life is only a net positive if welfare is above this level.\nCRITICAL_LEVEL = 10\n\n# 2. Define an \"elite\" population (A): a small number of people with excellent lives.\nelite_population_welfares = [1000] \nelite_population_size = len(elite_population_welfares)\nelite_welfare_per_person = elite_population_welfares[0]\n\n# 3. Define the \"non-elite\" population (B), where welfare is positive but below the critical level.\nnon_elite_welfare_per_person = 5\n# We test with a very large number of these people to check if quantity can overcome quality.\nnon_elite_population_size = 1000000 \nnon_elite_population_welfares = [non_elite_welfare_per_person] * non_elite_population_size\n\n# --- Test the Non-Elitism Condition ---\n# Non-Elitism claims we can find a size for Population B to make it better than Population A.\n# Let's calculate the values to test this claim.\n\nelite_value = calculate_critical_level_value(elite_population_welfares, CRITICAL_LEVEL)\nnon_elite_value = calculate_critical_level_value(non_elite_population_welfares, CRITICAL_LEVEL)\n\n# --- Print the results and the equations ---\nprint(\"--- Demonstrating Why Critical-Level Views Violate 'Non-Elitism' ---\")\nprint(f\"Critical Level (c) is set to: {CRITICAL_LEVEL}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Population A (Elite):\")\nprint(f\"  - Welfare per person (w_A): {elite_welfare_per_person}\")\nprint(f\"  - Number of people (n_A): {elite_population_size}\")\nprint(f\"  - Value Calculation: n_A * (w_A - c) = {elite_population_size} * ({elite_welfare_per_person} - {CRITICAL_LEVEL})\")\nprint(f\"  - Final Value for A: {elite_value}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Population B (Non-Elite):\")\nprint(f\"  - Welfare per person (w_B): {non_elite_welfare_per_person}\")\nprint(f\"  - Number of people (n_B): {non_elite_population_size}\")\nprint(f\"  - Value Calculation: n_B * (w_B - c) = {non_elite_population_size} * ({non_elite_welfare_per_person} - {CRITICAL_LEVEL})\")\nprint(f\"  - Final Value for B: {non_elite_value}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\nprint(f\"Non-Elitism requires that Population B could be better than Population A.\")\nprint(f\"Is the value of Population B ({non_elite_value}) > the value of Population A ({elite_value})?\")\n\nif non_elite_value > elite_value:\n    print(\"Result: Yes.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Result: No. The condition is VIOLATED.\")\n    print(\"Because each person in Population B has welfare below the critical level, they contribute a negative value.\")\n    print(\"Increasing the size of Population B only makes its total value more negative, so it can never be better than Population A.\")\n\n<<<C>>>"
