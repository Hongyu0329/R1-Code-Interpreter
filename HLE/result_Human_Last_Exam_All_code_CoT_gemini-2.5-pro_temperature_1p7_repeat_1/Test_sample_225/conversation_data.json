    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. In our case, `x(t) = cos(9t)` can be written as `sin(9t + π/2)`, so we have `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for self-intersections:** There's a well-established formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve, provided that `a` and `b` are coprime integers (their greatest common divisor is 1). The formula is:\n    `Number of self-intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n3.  **Check the conditions:**\n    *   The parameters `a = 9` and `b = 5` are integers.\n    *   We need to check if they are coprime. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5, `GCD(9, 5)`, is 1. So, they are coprime.\n\n4.  **Apply the formula:** Since the conditions are met, we can plug the values of `a` and `b` into the formula:\n    `Number of intersections = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2`\n    `= 8 * 4 / 2`\n    `= 32 / 2`\n    `= 16`\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result and prints the equation steps as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersections for a Lissajous curve\n    of the form x=cos(at), y=sin(bt).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The curve is defined by (cos(9t), sin(5t))\n    # This corresponds to a Lissajous curve with parameters a and b.\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections is (a-1)*(b-1)/2,\n    # provided that a and b are coprime integers.\n    # First, we check if a and b are coprime using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    if gcd_val == 1:\n        # Calculate the intermediate values for the equation step-by-step\n        a_minus_1 = a - 1\n        b_minus_1 = b - 1\n        numerator = a_minus_1 * b_minus_1\n        result = numerator // 2\n\n        # Print the final equation with all its numbers\n        print(f\"For the curve (cos({a}t), sin({b}t)), the number of self-intersections is found using the formula (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\")\n        print(\"Calculation:\")\n        print(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = {a_minus_1} * {b_minus_1} / 2 = {numerator} / 2 = {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The standard formula cannot be used because a={a} and b={b} are not coprime (GCD = {gcd_val}).\")\n\nsolve_lissajous_intersections()\n<<<16>>>\n```"
