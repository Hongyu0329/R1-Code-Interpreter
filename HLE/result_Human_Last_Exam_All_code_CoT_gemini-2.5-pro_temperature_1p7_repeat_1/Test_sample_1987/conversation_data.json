    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Function `f`\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined recursively.\n- **Base Cases:**\n  1. `f(...) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence `a_1, a_2, ...` is not non-decreasing (`a_i <= a_{i+1}`).\n  2. `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n- **Recursive Step:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` is the sum of `n` recursive calls, where each call decrements one of the arguments `a_i` by 1.\n\nThis structure suggests a path-counting problem on an n-dimensional integer grid. The value `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` represents the number of paths from point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)` using only steps in the negative direction of each axis (e.g., `(-1, 0, ...)`), with the constraint that the path must always stay within the region defined by `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\n### Step 2: Devise a Calculation Strategy for Each Task\n\n1.  **`f(2, 4, 5)`:** The inputs are small. A direct recursive implementation with memoization (to avoid recomputing the same subproblems) would work. However, problems of this type often have a known closed-form solution in combinatorics, which is more efficient and elegant. The number of such paths is given by a known formula. For `n=3`, this is:\n    `f(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (a_1+a_2+a_3)! / (a_1! * (a_2+1)! * (a_3+2)!) * (a_2-a_1+1) * (a_3-a_1+2) * (a_3-a_2+1)`\n    I will use this formula to calculate the result directly.\n\n2.  **`f(9000, 9000, 9000)`:** The inputs are very large, so a recursive solution is not feasible. I must use a closed-form formula. This is a special case of the above formula where `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = p` (with `p=9000`). Substituting into the formula and simplifying gives:\n    `f(p, p, p) = ( (3p)! / (p! (p+1)! (p+2)!) ) * (1 * 2 * 1)`\n    `f(p, p, p) = ( (3p)! / (p! p! p!) ) * ( 2 / ((p+1)^2 * (p+2)) )`\n    This can be calculated using Python's `math.comb` for multinomial coefficients and its ability to handle arbitrarily large integers:\n    `f(p, p, p) = (comb(3p, p) * comb(2p, p)) * 2 // ((p+1)^2 * (p+2))`\n\n3.  **`f(p, p, p, p) mod p` for prime `p = 10^9 + 7`:** Again, a closed-form formula is necessary. For `n=4` and `a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=p`, the formula is:\n    `f(p,p,p,p) = (Multinomial(4p; p,p,p,p)) * (1!*2!*3!) / ((p+1)^3 * (p+2)^2 * (p+3))`\n    We need to compute this modulo the prime `p`.\n    - The fractional part is `12 / ((p+1)^3(p+2)^2(p+3))`. Modulo `p`, this becomes `12 / (1^3 * 2^2 * 3) = 12 / 12 = 1`.\n    - We are left with calculating `Multinomial(4p; p,p,p,p) mod p`.\n    - `Multinomial(4p; p,p,p,p) = C(4p,p) * C(3p,p) * C(2p,p)`, where `C` is the binomial coefficient.\n    - By Lucas's Theorem, for a prime `p`, `C(ap, bp) â‰¡ C(a,b) (mod p)`.\n    - `C(4p, p) mod p = C(4,1) = 4`\n    - `C(3p, p) mod p = C(3,1) = 3`\n    - `C(2p, p) mod p = C(2,1) = 2`\n    - Therefore, `f(p,p,p,p) mod p = (4 * 3 * 2) * 1 = 24`.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Solution in Python\n\nI will write a single Python script that implements the calculations based on the closed-form formulas derived above. The script will also print the intermediate numbers in the equations as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the three requested values using closed-form combinatorial formulas.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Part 1: Calculate f(2, 4, 5) ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating f(2, 4, 5) ---\")\n    # Using the closed-form formula for n=3:\n    # f(a1,a2,a3) = ((a1+a2+a3)! / (a1!*(a2+1)!*(a3+2)!)) * (a2-a1+1)*(a3-a1+2)*(a3-a2+1)\n    a1, a2, a3 = 2, 4, 5\n    \n    total_sum = a1 + a2 + a3\n    # Product term of differences\n    prod_term = (a2 - a1 + 1) * (a3 - a1 + 2) * (a3 - a2 + 1)\n    # Factorial term\n    fact_term = math.factorial(total_sum) // (math.factorial(a1) * math.factorial(a2 + 1) * math.factorial(a3 + 2))\n    \n    val1 = fact_term * prod_term\n    \n    print(f\"The equation is: ((2+4+5)! / (2! * (4+1)! * (5+2)!)) * ((4-2+1) * (5-2+2) * (5-4+1))\")\n    print(f\"Evaluated terms: ({fact_term}) * ({prod_term})\")\n    print(f\"Result for f(2, 4, 5) = {val1}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Part 2: Calculate f(9000, 9000, 9000) ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating f(9000, 9000, 9000) ---\")\n    # Using the simplified closed-form for f(p, p, p):\n    # f(p,p,p) = (comb(3p, p) * comb(2p, p)) * 2 // ((p+1)^2 * (p+2))\n    p2 = 9000\n    \n    # Python's math.comb and arbitrary-precision integers can handle these large numbers\n    term1_p2 = math.comb(3 * p2, p2)\n    term2_p2 = math.comb(2 * p2, p2)\n    numerator_p2 = term1_p2 * term2_p2 * 2\n    denominator_p2 = (p2 + 1)**2 * (p2 + 2)\n    \n    val2 = numerator_p2 // denominator_p2\n    \n    print(f\"The equation is: (C(3*9000, 9000) * C(2*9000, 9000) * 2) // ((9000+1)^2 * (9000+2))\")\n    print(f\"This requires large number arithmetic.
