    "In his \"Spheres\" trilogy, particularly in the second volume, *Globes*, Peter Sloterdijk analyzes the modern state as a \"macrosphere\" designed to provide security and immunity for its population. He uses the metaphor of the **greenhouse** (in German, *Treibhaus*) to describe this particular anthroposphere. The state, like a greenhouse, creates a controlled, artificial environment to protect its inhabitants from external threats and hardships, effectively domesticating and nurturing them like plants.\n\n<<<the greenhouse>>>"
