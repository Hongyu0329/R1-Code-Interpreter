    "This is a historical question. The person whose work on statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat laid the groundwork for Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion was Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein's paper was a powerful application and validation of the statistical framework that Boltzmann had pioneered in his lectures and writings, such as his \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"\n\nWhile Einstein developed his own statistical approach with remarkable originality, and may not have included a formal citation to Boltzmann in that specific paper in the modern sense, the work is universally recognized as being built upon the foundations laid by Boltzmann. I will print the name for you.\n\n```python\ndef get_cited_lecturer():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the name of the scientist whose lectures and work\n  on statistical mechanics were foundational to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper\n  on Brownian motion.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The key figure is Ludwig Boltzmann, a pioneer of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases.\n  lecturer_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n  print(\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein's work was deeply rooted in the foundational principles of statistical mechanics established by:\")\n  print(lecturer_name)\n\nget_cited_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
