    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to understand the connection between the number of subgroups of a certain index and group homomorphisms. There's a well-known formula that connects the number of subgroups of index `n` in a group `G` to the number of homomorphisms from `G` to transitive subgroups of the symmetric group `S_n`.\n2.  The formula is: The number of index-`n` subgroups of `G` is the sum of `|Epi(G, T)| / |Aut(T)|` over all isomorphism classes of transitive subgroups `T` of `S_n`. `Epi(G, T)` denotes the set of surjective homomorphisms from `G` to `T`, and `Aut(T)` is the automorphism group of `T`.\n3.  The group in question is the Grigorchuk group, let's call it `Γ`. A crucial property of `Γ` is that it is a 2-group, meaning all its elements have an order that is a power of 2. This implies that any homomorphic image of `Γ` must also be a 2-group.\n4.  We are looking for subgroups of index 4. So we need to consider transitive subgroups of `S_4`. The transitive subgroups of `S_4` that are also 2-groups are `C_4` (cyclic group of order 4), `V_4` (Klein four-group), and `D_4` (dihedral group of order 8).\n5.  Another key property of the Grigorchuk group `Γ` is that for any finite 2-group `F`, the number of epimorphisms `|Epi(Γ, F)|` is equal to `|Epi(F_3, F)|`, where `F_3` is the free group on 3 generators. For abelian groups `A`, this simplifies further to `|Epi(Γ, A)| = |Epi(Γ_ab, A)|`, where `Γ_ab`, the abelianization of `Γ`, is `(Z/2Z)^3`.\n6.  My python script will calculate the contribution for each of the three possible transitive 2-subgroups (`C_4`, `V_4`, `D_4`) and sum them up to get the final answer. The script will print out the numbers for each step of the calculation to show the process clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n\n    Method:\n    1. The number of subgroups of index n in a group G can be calculated by summing over\n       the isomorphism classes of transitive subgroups T of the symmetric group S_n.\n       The formula is: Sum [ |Epi(G, T)| / |Aut(T)| ]\n       where Epi(G, T) is the set of surjective homomorphisms from G to T,\n       and Aut(T) is the automorphism group of T.\n\n    2. For the Grigorchuk group (Γ) and index n=4, we are interested in transitive\n       subgroups T of S_4. Furthermore, since Γ is a 2-group (every element has order\n       a power of 2), any homomorphic image of Γ must also be a 2-group.\n\n    3. The transitive subgroups of S_4 that are 2-groups are:\n       - C4 (Cyclic group of order 4)\n       - V4 (Klein-four group, order 4)\n       - D4 (Dihedral group of order 8)\n\n    4. A key property of the Grigorchuk group Γ is that for any finite 2-group F,\n       the number of epimorphisms from Γ to F is the same as from a free group F_d,\n       where d is the rank of the pro-2 completion of Γ. Here, d=3.\n       So, |Epi(Γ, F)| = |Epi(F_3, F)|.\n\n    5. For abelian targets A, the formula simplifies: |Epi(Γ, A)| = |Epi(Γ_ab, A)|,\n       where Γ_ab = (Z/2Z)^3 is the abelianization of Γ.\n\n    The code will calculate the contribution for each of the three possible target groups\n    (C4, V4, D4) and sum them up.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Contribution from T = C4 (Cyclic group of order 4) ---\n    # Target T is abelian, so we consider homomorphisms from Γ_ab = (Z/2Z)^3 to C4.\n    # An element of (Z/2Z)^3 has order at most 2.
