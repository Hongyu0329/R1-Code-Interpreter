  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.

To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board.

    "My plan is to first create a Python script to solve the problem as requested, and then, as a separate mental exercise to answer the user's specific sub-task, design the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory used by its variables.\n\n### Python Solution Plan\n1.  **Read Input:** The input is a single line string like `3+2+1`. I'll read this line.\n2.  **Extract Numbers:** The `+` symbols are delimiters. I can get a list of the numbers by removing the `+` signs from the string.\n3.  **Sort Numbers:** I'll sort the list of numbers. Since they are single-digit numbers, sorting them as characters will produce the correct non-decreasing order.\n4.  **Format Output:** Finally, I'll join the sorted numbers back into a string, separated by `+`, and print the result.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program Analysis\nThe user also asked for `m`, the memory used by variables in the most memory-efficient C program for this task. Here's my analysis for that:\n1.  **Avoid Storing Input:** To be maximally memory-efficient, the program should not store the entire 1000-character input string. Instead, it can read the input one character at a time using `getchar()`.\n2.  **Use Counting Sort:** Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, I can use a small array to count the frequency of each number. An array of size 4 is sufficient. `short counts[4];` will work, as the max count for any number will be less than 501. This uses `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n3.  **Minimal Data Types:** I will choose the smallest possible standard data types for all variables.\n    *   For reading input with `getchar()`, an `int` is required to handle the `EOF` value: `int c;` (4 bytes).\n    *   For loop counters and flags, I'll use `char` or `short` where possible. A `char` flag for handling `+` printing (1 byte), a `char` loop counter `i` (1 byte), and a `short` loop counter `j` (2 bytes) are sufficient.\n4.  **Calculate Total Memory:** Summing up the memory for these variables gives the total memory `m`.\n    *   `m = sizeof(counts) + sizeof(c) + sizeof(flag) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(j)`\n    *   `m = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 16` bytes.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), rearranges them in non-decreasing order,\n    and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string, e.g., \"3+2+1\"\n    input_sum = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Extract the numbers from the string by filtering out the '+' characters\n    numbers = [char for char in input_sum if char != '+']\n    \n    # Sort the list of numbers. Sorting characters '1', '2', '3' works as expected.\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Join the sorted numbers back together with '+' to form the final string\n    output_sum = \"+\".join(numbers)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(output_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
