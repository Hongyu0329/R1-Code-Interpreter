    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}$, we will use the product formula for simplicial volumes and the formula for the simplicial volume of a hyperbolic surface.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.** For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g > 1$, its simplicial volume is given by $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4$.\n2.  **Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface.** We will compute $||\\Sigma_{31}||$ and $||\\Sigma_{17}||$.\n3.  **Recall the product formula for simplicial volumes.** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $n$ and $m$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product is $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{n+m}{n} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n4.  **Apply the product formula.** In our case, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$. Both are 2-dimensional surfaces, so $n=m=2$. We will combine the results from the previous steps to find the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of Sigma_31 x Sigma_17.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Define the genera and dimensions\n    g1 = 31\n    g2 = 17\n    dim1 = 2\n    dim2 = 2\n\n    # Step 1: Compute the simplicial volume of Sigma_31\n    # For a surface of genus g > 1, the formula is ||Sigma_g|| = 4*g - 4.\n    # Since g1 = 31 > 1, this formula applies.\n    sv_g1 = 4 * g1 - 4\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the simplicial volume of Sigma_17\n    # Since g2 = 17 > 1, this formula applies.\n    sv_g2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the binomial coefficient for the product formula\n    # The product formula is ||M x N|| = C(dim(M)+dim(N), dim(M)) * ||M|| * ||N||\n    total_dim = dim1 + dim2\n    binom_coeff = math.comb(total_dim, dim1)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final result\n    result = binom_coeff * sv_g1 * sv_g2\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"The simplicial volume of \\u03A3_{g1} x \\u03A3_{g2} is calculated using the product formula.\")\n    print(f\"Formula: C(dim(\\u03A3_{g1}) + dim(\\u03A3_{g2}), dim(\\u03A3_{g1})) * ||\\u03A3_{g1}|| * ||\\u03A3_{g2}||\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"First, the simplicial volume of \\u03A3_{g1}:\")\n    print(f\"||\\u03A3_{g1}|| = 4 * {g1} - 4 = {sv_g1}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nSecond, the simplicial volume of \\u03A3_{g2}:\")\n    print(f\"||\\u03A3_{g2}|| = 4 * {g2} - 4 = {sv_g2}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThird, the binomial coefficient for the product of two {dim1}-dimensional manifolds:\")\n    print(f\"C({dim1} + {dim2}, {dim1}) = C({total_dim}, {dim1}) = {binom_coeff}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinally, the simplicial volume of the product is:\")\n    print(f\"||\\u03A3_{g1} x \\u03A3_{g2}|| = {binom_coeff} * {sv_g1} * {sv_g2} = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
