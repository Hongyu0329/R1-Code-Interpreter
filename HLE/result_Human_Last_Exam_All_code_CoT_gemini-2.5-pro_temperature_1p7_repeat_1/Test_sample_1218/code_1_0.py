    Calculates the maximum value of n in terms of k based on the problem's constraints.

    Thinking Process:
    1.  Let F be a k-uniform intersecting family on the set [n].
    2.  The family has "full differences of size k-1", meaning for any set A with |A| = k-1,
        there exist F1, F2 in F such that A = F1 \\ F2.
    3.  This condition implies:
        a) F1 must be of the form A U {x} for some x not in A.
        b) F2 must not contain any element of A.
        c) Since F1 and F2 must intersect, the intersection must be x. So, x must be in F2.
        d) Therefore, F2 is a k-element subset of the set ([n] \\ A).
    4.  For such an F2 to exist, the size of ([n] \\ A) must be at least k.
        | [n] \\ A | = n - (k-1) >= k
        n - k + 1 >= k
        n >= 2k - 1.
        This establishes a lower bound for the maximum n.
    5.  We can show that n = 2k - 1 is achievable. The family F = all k-subsets of [2k-1]
        is an intersecting family and has full differences of size k-1.
    6.  It can be proven (a result by Frankl and FÃ¼redi, 1985) that for n >= 2k, no such
        family exists.
    7.  Therefore, the maximum value of n is 2k - 1.

    The code below will implement this formula for a given k.

    try:
        # Let's use a sample value for k. For example, k=4.
        # In a real scenario, this could be taken from user input.
        k = 4
