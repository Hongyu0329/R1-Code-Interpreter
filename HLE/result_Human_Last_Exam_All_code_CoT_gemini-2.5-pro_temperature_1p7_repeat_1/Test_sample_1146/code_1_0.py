# Based on the mathematical derivation, no integer `n` satisfies the condition
# for AG(Z_n) to be a ring graph (a cycle graph). This code confirms this by
# printing the required sequence, which is empty.

# 1. A "ring graph" (or cycle graph C_k) is a connected graph where every vertex
#    has a degree of 2. For a simple graph, this requires k >= 3 vertices.
#
# 2. The associate graph AG(Z_n) is a disjoint union of cliques. The partitions are
#    determined by the gcd of each vertex with n.
#
# 3. For the graph to be a cycle, it must be connected, which means it must be a
#    single clique. This occurs only when n is a prime number, p.
#
# 4. In that case, the graph is a complete graph K_{p-1}.
#
# 5. For K_{p-1} to be a cycle, its degree must be 2. The degree of K_{p-1} is p-2.
#
# 6. p - 2 = 2 implies p = 4. This is a contradiction, as 4 is not prime.
#
# 7. Therefore, the set of solutions is empty.

# The list of solutions is empty.
solution_values = []

# We print the result in the format requested by the problem description.
