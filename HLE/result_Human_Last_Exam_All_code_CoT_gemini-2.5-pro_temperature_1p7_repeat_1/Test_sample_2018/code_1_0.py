# The Carman-Kozeny equation is used to model the mushy zone as a porous medium.
# The momentum source term S is often written as: S = -A * u
# Where A is the porosity function: A = (C * (1-f)^2) / (f^3 + b)
# f is the liquid fraction, b is a small number to avoid division by zero,
# and C is the "mushy zone constant" or "computational factor".

# Based on a review of the relevant literature:
# 1. The original paper (Voller & Prakash, 1987) that introduced the method
#    used a specific value for C.
# 2. The subsequent benchmark paper (Brent, Voller & Reid, 1988) on melting
#    gallium changed this value.

# The question asks for the ORIGINAL value from the PRIOR (first) paper.
original_computational_factor = 1.6 * 10**6

# Printing the value in the format requested by the prompt.
# We are creating a simple "equation" to show the final number.
equation_representation = f"Original Computational Factor = {original_computational_factor:1.1e}"

# Display the final answer clearly.
