    This function calculates the theoretical outcome of the cross-reality CHSH test
    as described in the problem.

    In a Bell test experiment confirming quantum mechanics, the CHSH value 'S' can
    reach a maximum of 2 * sqrt(2). A classical reality is limited to |S| <= 2.
    The prompt suggests a cross-verification test. We will model this by assuming
    the 'man' reality is a standard quantum reality and the 'butterfly dream'
    reality is a linked one that produces an inverse CHSH value.

    The "test sum" is the sum of the CHSH values from both realities.
