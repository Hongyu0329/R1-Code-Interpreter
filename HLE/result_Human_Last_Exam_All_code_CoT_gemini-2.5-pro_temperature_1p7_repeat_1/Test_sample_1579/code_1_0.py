# Step 1: Define the given surface area.
area = 8

# The problem is interpreted as finding the length of a great circle on a standard sphere
# with the given area. This length is a sharp upper bound for geodesics in this standard case
# and is conjectured to be the maximal length of the shortest closed geodesic for any metric.

# Step 2: Calculate the radius R from the area A = 4 * pi * R^2.
# R^2 = A / (4 * pi)
# R = sqrt(A / (4 * pi))
radius_squared = area / (4 * math.pi)
radius = math.sqrt(radius_squared)

# Step 3: Calculate the length of the closed geodesic (great circle) L = 2 * pi * R.
length = 2 * math.pi * radius

# The exact expression for the length is 2 * sqrt(2 * pi). Let's verify:
# L = 2 * pi * sqrt(8 / (4 * pi)) = 2 * pi * sqrt(2 / pi) = 2 * sqrt(pi^2 * 2 / pi) = 2 * sqrt(2 * pi).
# Numerically, sqrt(8 * pi) also works: sqrt(8 * math.pi).

# Step 4: Print the final calculation and result.
# The calculation can be simplified to L = sqrt(Area * pi).
final_length = math.sqrt(area * math.pi)
