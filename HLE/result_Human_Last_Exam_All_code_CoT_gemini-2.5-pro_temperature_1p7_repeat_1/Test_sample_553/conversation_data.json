    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nThe user is asking a music theory question about The Beatles' discography. I need to identify a song that starts with a specific chord progression: moving from the tonic chord (the \"I\" chord) to the minor fifth chord (the \"v\" chord). This is a fairly uncommon and distinctive progression in pop music, as the fifth chord in a major key is almost always major.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:** A \"tonic to minor fifth\" (I -> v) progression means that if a song is in a major key, like C major, it would move from a C major chord to a G minor chord. The G minor chord is \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key of C minor.\n2.  **Scan Beatles Songs:** I will access my knowledge base of The Beatles' music, focusing on the opening chords of their songs.\n3.  **Identify the Correct Song:** The song \"I'll Follow the Sun\" from the album *Beatles for Sale* fits this description perfectly. It is in the key of C major. The verse starts by moving from a C major chord (\"One day...\") to a G minor 7th chord (\"...you'll look...\"). This C (I) to Gm7 (v7) progression is exactly what the user is asking about.\n4.  **Construct the Python Script:** I will create a Python script that prints the name of the song and explains the chord progression as requested, making sure to detail the \"equation\" of which chord corresponds to which Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef solve_beatles_chord_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the Beatles song with the specified chord progression\n    and prints the details for the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"I'll Follow the Sun\"\n    key = \"C Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"C Major\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"G minor 7th\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is: '{song_title}'\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a breakdown of the musical analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(\"The chord progression at the start of the verse is:\")\n\n    # Fulfilling the request to \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # by showing the Roman numerals and their corresponding chord names.\n    print(f\"1. The Tonic (I) chord: {tonic_chord}\")\n    print(f\"5. The Minor Fifth (v) chord: {minor_fifth_chord}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis I -> v progression (C -> Gm7) is a classic example of using a 'borrowed' chord from the parallel minor key to create a unique, wistful sound.\")\n\nsolve_beatles_chord_mystery()\n```\n<<<I'll Follow the Sun>>>"
