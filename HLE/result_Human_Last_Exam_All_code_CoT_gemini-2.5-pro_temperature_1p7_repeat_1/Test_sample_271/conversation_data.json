    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem asks for the possible degrees of all proper normal intermediate field extensions of the splitting field of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there's a correspondence between intermediate fields and subgroups of the Galois group. Normal extensions correspond to normal subgroups. The degree of an extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ corresponds to the index of the respective subgroup.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will find the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ of the splitting field $K$ of the given polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  Next, I will identify all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. These correspond to the field extensions $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n3.  Then, I will calculate the index for each of these normal subgroups. The index of a subgroup $H$ in $G$ is given by $|G|/|H|$. These indices are the possible degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n4.  Finally, I will list the unique values of these degrees.\n\nI will use Python to formalize the calculations and display the results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and lists the possible degrees of normal field extensions L/Q\n    for the splitting field K of the polynomial f(x) over Q, where\n    Q is a proper subfield of L and L is a proper subfield of K.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Factor the polynomial and identify the components.\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6.\n    # This polynomial factors over Q into:\n    # f(x) = (x^2 - 2) * (x^5 - 9x + 3)\n    # Let f1(x) = x^2 - 2 and f2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3.\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the Galois group for each factor.\n    # The Galois group of f1(x) = x^2 - 2 over Q is the cyclic group C_2.\n    g1_order = 2\n    \n    # The polynomial f2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3 is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion for p=3.\n    # It can be shown to have exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    # A key theorem in Galois theory states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree p with\n    # exactly p-2 real roots has the symmetric group S_p as its Galois group.
