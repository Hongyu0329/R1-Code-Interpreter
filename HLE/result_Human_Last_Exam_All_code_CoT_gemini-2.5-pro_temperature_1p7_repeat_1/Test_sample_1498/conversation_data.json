    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will first identify the specific section within the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that deals with the Messengers of God.\n2.  I will then scan these verses (known as 'bayt' in Arabic poetry) to find the exact point where the list of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an begins.\n3.  I will note the starting verse number and the ending verse number for this list.\n4.  Finally, I will generate a Python script that prints a clear statement indicating the range of these verses and also explicitly prints each verse number in that range, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the range of verses (bayt) in the poem\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the names of the prophets are mentioned.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The list of the 25 prophets begins at bayt 30 and ends at bayt 33.\n    start_bayt = 30\n    end_bayt = 33\n\n    print(f\"In Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe specific bayt numbers in this range are:\")\n\n    # Per the user's request, printing each number in the final range.\n    for i in range(start_bayt, end_bayt + 1):\n        print(i)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<30 to 33>>>"
