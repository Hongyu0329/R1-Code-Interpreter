    "In poker, specifically No-Limit Texas Hold'em, the \"Button\" is the most powerful pre-flop position. This positional advantage allows you to play a much wider range of hands profitably compared to other positions.\n\nWhen considering which hands to \"open\" (be the first to raise), we use Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts as a baseline. These charts are derived from computer simulations that have played trillions of hands to find a balanced, unexploitable strategy.\n\nFor a 100 big blind (BB) deep, rake-free game, the button's opening range is extremely wide, often including 40-50% of all possible starting hands. Suited hands are particularly valuable due to their ability to make flushes. The weakest possible version of a suited jack is one paired with the lowest possible card, a deuce (2). According to GTO principles for this game format, even the least connected suited Jack, J2s, is a standard and profitable open-raise from the button. Any suited Jack with a higher kicker (J3s, J4s, etc.) is even more profitable.\n\nTherefore, the \"worst\" suited jack you should still open is the one with the lowest kicker.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free game.\n\n    Poker theory dictates that the button is the strongest pre-flop position,\n    allowing for a very wide opening range. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts for\n    a 100BB deep game indicate that all suited jacks are profitable opens from this position,\n    especially in a rake-free environment which makes marginal hands more playable.\n\n    The suited jacks are ranked by the value of their second card (kicker).\n    The hand 'J2s' (Jack-Two suited) has the lowest possible kicker.\n    Since all suited jacks are considered standard opens in this scenario,\n    the \"worst\" one is the one with the lowest rank.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The hand is abbreviated as the higher card, the lower card, and 's' for suited.\n    worst_suited_jack = \"J2s\"\n    \n    print(\"Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy for a 100BB rake-free cash game:\")\n    print(\"The worst suited Jack that you should open-raise from the button position is J2s.\")\n    print(\"The hand is represented by the characters:\")\n    \n    # Per instructions, outputting each character in the final \"equation\" (in this case, the hand name)\n    print(f\"Character 1: {worst_suited_jack[0]}\")\n    print(f\"Character 2: {worst_suited_jack[1]}\")\n    print(f\"Character 3: {worst_suited_jack[2]}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_to_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
