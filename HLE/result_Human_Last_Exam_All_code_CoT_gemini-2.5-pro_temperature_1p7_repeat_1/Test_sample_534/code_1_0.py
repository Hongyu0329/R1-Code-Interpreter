    This function solves the problem based on the topological analysis.
    The space X is constructed from a baseline and four 'Gate' shapes (P).
    The point a = (0,1,0) is located at the end of a line segment within one of these Gates.
    The problem asks for the number of connected components of the set K, where K is the intersection of all compact connected neighborhoods of 'a'.

    Our analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  We identify that locally, the space X around the point 'a' is a simple line segment.
    2.  We construct a family of compact connected neighborhoods of 'a' of the form N_delta = {0} x [1-delta, 1] x {0} for small delta > 0.
    3.  The intersection of all such neighborhoods (and thus the intersection of all possible compact connected neighborhoods) is the point 'a' itself. So, K = {a}.
    4.  A set consisting of a single point is connected.
    5.  Therefore, the set K has exactly one connected component.
