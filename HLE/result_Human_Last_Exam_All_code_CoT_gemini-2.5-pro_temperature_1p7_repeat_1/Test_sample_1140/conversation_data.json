    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the most suitable synthesis technique for your peptide and present it in the required format.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The request is to identify the best method for synthesizing a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide that includes a specific unnatural amino acid (UAA), azido phenylalanine.\n2.  **Evaluate Synthesis Options:** I will consider three primary techniques:\n    *   **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** The standard method for chemical peptide synthesis. I'll assess its feasibility for a 100aa sequence.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** A method for joining smaller peptide fragments together to create a larger one.\n    *   **Genetic Code Expansion:** An *in vivo* biological technique that uses engineered cell machinery to incorporate UAAs during protein translation.\n3.  **Perform a Calculation:** To illustrate the main challenge with SPPS, I will write a Python script to calculate the theoretical maximum yield for a 100aa peptide, assuming an optimistic 99% coupling efficiency for each step. This will provide a quantitative reason for why SPPS is not the recommended approach and satisfy the requirement to use code to solve a task.\n4.  **Recommend the Best Technique:** Based on the analysis, the script will then explain the different methods and conclude by recommending the most powerful and suitable technique for this specific challenge.\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:** I will provide the final concise answer in the specified format.\n\nHere is the Python script:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_peptide_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and recommends a synthesis method for a long peptide\n    containing an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the problem parameters based on the user's query\n    peptide_length = 100\n    unnatural_amino_acid = \"azido phenylalanine\"\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Synthesis for a 100aa Peptide with an Unnatural Amino Acid ---\")\n    print(f\"Peptide Length: {peptide_length} aa\")\n    print(f\"Target Unnatural Amino Acid: '{unnatural_amino_acid}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # 1.
