    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of the Conductor N**:\n    First, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of Dirichlet Characters**:\n    A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters corresponding to each prime power in the factorization of $N$.\n    So, $\\chi$ can be written as:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\cdot \\chi_{3^2} \\cdot \\chi_{7} \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$\n    where each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^k$.\n\n3.  **Order of the Character**:\n    The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We are looking for characters of order 6, so:\n    $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Component Characters**:\n    For the lcm of the orders to be 6, the order of each component character must be a divisor of 6. Let's find the number of choices for each primitive component character whose order divides 6. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ (where $d|m$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n\n    *   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character of order 2. Since 2 divides 6, there is 1 choice for $\\chi_4$.\n    *   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The primitive characters are those that are not characters modulo 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ non-primitive characters. So, there are $6-2=4$ primitive characters. Their orders are 3 and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$. All these orders divide 6. So there are 4 choices for $\\chi_9$.\n    *   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders are 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. So there are 5 choices for $\\chi_7$.\n    *   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. Primitive characters have orders 2, 5, and 10. Only the one with order 2 divides 6. Number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. So there is 1 choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n    *   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. Primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Those dividing 6 are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. So there are 5 choices for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\n5.  **Verification of the LCM**:\n    We have found the number of ways to choose a tuple of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ where each component has an order dividing 6. We must ensure that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n    *   The lcm is divisible by 2 because the order of $\\chi_4$ is always 2.\n    *   The lcm is divisible by 3 because the order of $\\chi_9$ is either 3 or 6, both of which are divisible by 3.\n    *   The orders of all components are divisors of 6, so they do not have prime factors other than 2 or 3.\n    Therefore, the lcm for any combination of such characters is guaranteed to be $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**:\n    The total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this product.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of choices for each primitive component character\n# whose order divides 6.\n\n# For conductor 4: primitive characters have order 2. phi(2)=1.\nchoices_4 = phi(2)\nprint(f\"For conductor 4, primitive characters must have order 2. Number of choices: phi(2) = {choices_4}\")\n\n# For conductor 9: primitive characters have order 3 or 6.\nchoices_9 = phi(3) + phi(6)\nprint(f\"For conductor 9, primitive characters can have orders 3 or 6. Number of choices: phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {choices_9}\")\n\n# For conductor 7: primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6.\nchoices_7 = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6)\nprint(f\"For conductor 7, primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6. Number of choices: phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi(2)} + {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {choices_7}\")\n\n# For conductor 11: primitive characters' orders must divide 6. Only order 2 is possible.\nchoices_11 = phi(2)\nprint(f\"For conductor 11, primitive characters' order must divide 6. Only order 2 is possible. Number of choices: phi(2) = {choices_11}\")\n\n# For conductor 13: primitive characters' orders must divide 6. Possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\nchoices_13 = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6)\nprint(f\"For conductor 13, primitive characters' orders must divide 6. Possible orders are 2, 3, 6. Number of choices: phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi(2)} + {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {choices_13}\")\n\n# Step 6: Final Calculation\ntotal_chars = choices_4 * choices_9 * choices_7 * choices_11 * choices_13\n\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component.\")\nprint(f\"Total number = {choices_4} * {choices_9} * {choices_7} * {choices_11} * {choices_13}\")\nprint(f\"Total number = {total_chars}\")\n```\n<<<100>>>"
