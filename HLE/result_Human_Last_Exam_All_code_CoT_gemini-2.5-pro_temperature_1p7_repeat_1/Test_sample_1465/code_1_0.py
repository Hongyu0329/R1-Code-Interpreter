    This script predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil protein sequences based on
    established biophysical principles.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Define the list of protein sequences provided by the user.
    2. For each sequence, determine the amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the
       coiled-coil heptad repeat. We assume a 'gabcdef' register, where the sequence
       starts at the 'g' position. This places 'a' at index 1 and 'd' at index 4 (and so on).
    3. Apply a rule-based system to predict the oligomeric state (2 for dimer, 3 for trimer, 4 for tetramer)
       based on the composition of these core 'a' and 'd' residues. These rules are derived
       from foundational studies in protein design.
    4. Print the predicted state for each sequence in order.
