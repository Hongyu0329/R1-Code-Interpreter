    "Here is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Protein Sequences:** The key to determining the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein lies in its amino acid sequence, specifically within its repeating seven-residue pattern called a heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The residues at the `a` and `d` positions are buried in the core of the structure and are crucial for determining how many helices pack together (e.g., dimer, trimer, tetramer).\n\n2.  **Determine the Heptad Register:** First, we must identify which residues fall into the `a` and `d` positions. By looking for the characteristic pattern of hydrophobic residues, we can determine the register. For these sequences, the most likely register is `gabcdef`, meaning the first residue ('E') is in the `g` position, the second ('I') is in the `a` position, the fifth is in the `d` position, and so on.\n\n3.  **Apply Biophysical Rules:** Based on seminal research in protein design (e.g., by Harbury, Alber, and Kim), we can apply a set of rules based on the identity of the `a` and `d` residues:\n    *   Canonical dimers are often formed by `Isoleucine (I)` at `a` and `Leucine (L)` at `d`.\n    *   Canonical trimers are formed by `Isoleucine (I)` at both `a` and `d`.\n    *   Polar residues (like Asn, Thr, Lys) or very bulky ones (like Trp) in the core introduce special cases that can specify a particular oligomeric state.\n\n4.  **Develop a Python Script:** I will write a Python script to automate this analysis. The script will:\n    *   Take each sequence as input.\n    *   Extract the `a` and `d` position residues based on the `gabcdef` register.\n    *   Apply a series of `if/else` rules based on the established biophysical principles to predict the oligomeric state for each sequence.\n    *   Print the final list of predicted states.\n\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:** After running the script, the resulting sequence of numbers will be matched against the multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_coiled_coil_oligomer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil protein sequences based on\n    established biophysical principles.\n\n    The plan is as follows:\n    1. Define the list of protein sequences provided by the user.\n    2. For each sequence, determine the amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the\n       coiled-coil heptad repeat. We assume a 'gabcdef' register, where the sequence\n       starts at the 'g' position. This places 'a' at index 1 and 'd' at index 4 (and so on).\n    3. Apply a rule-based system to predict the oligomeric state (2 for dimer, 3 for trimer, 4 for tetramer)\n       based on the composition of these core 'a' and 'd' residues. These rules are derived\n       from foundational studies in protein design.\n    4.
