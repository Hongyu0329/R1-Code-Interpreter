    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### **Method explanation**\n\n1.  **Factor the Conductor:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. A character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if its factorization into characters $\\chi_i$ modulo the prime power factors of $d$ consists of components $\\chi_i$ that are all primitive. For $d=53599=7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$, a character $\\chi$ is primitive if it is a product $\\chi_7\\chi_{13}\\chi_{19}\\chi_{31}$ where each $\\chi_p$ is a primitive character modulo the prime $p$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it's not the principal character.\n\n2.  **Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. We want to find the number of combinations of primitive components such that their orders' lcm is exactly 6. We can solve this using the inclusion-exclusion principle on the order of the character. The number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order exactly $g$ is given by the formula:\n    $N_p(d, g) = \\sum_{k|g} \\mu(g/k) C'_p(d, k)$\n    where $C'_p(d, k)$ is the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ with order dividing $k$, and $\\mu$ is the Mobius function.\n\n3.  **Count Characters of Order Dividing k:** The number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ with order dividing $k$, $C'_p(d,k)$, is the product of the number of primitive characters for each prime factor $p$ of $d$ whose order divides $k$.\n    For a prime $p$, the number of characters mod $p$ with order dividing $k$ is $\\gcd(k, p-1)$. Since all characters mod $p$ are primitive except the principal one (which has order 1), the number of primitive characters with order dividing $k$ is $\\gcd(k, p-1) - 1$.\n    For $d=7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$ and $g=6$, we need to check the divisors of 6: {1, 2, 3, 6}. For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, $p-1$ is divisible by 6. Thus, for any divisor $k$ of 6, $\\gcd(k, p-1)=k$.\n    So, for each prime factor $p$, the number of primitive characters with order dividing $k$ is $k-1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Number:**\n    For $d = 53599$, let's denote the number of primitive characters with order dividing $k$ as $N_k$.\n    *   $N_1$: For each prime, there are $(1-1)=0$ characters. Total: $0^4 = 0$.\n    *   $N_2$: For each prime, there is $(2-1)=1$ character. Total: $1^4 = 1$.\n    *   $N_3$: For each prime, there are $(3-1)=2$ characters. Total: $2^4 = 16$.\n    *   $N_6$: For each prime, there are $(6-1)=5$ characters. Total: $5^4 = 625$.\n\n    The number of characters with order exactly 6 is given by the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n    Result $= N_6 - N_3 - N_2 + N_1$\n    Result $= 625 - 16 - 1 + 0 = 608$.\n\nThe following python code implements this logic.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom sympy import factorint\n\ndef get_prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"Return a list of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    return list(factorint(n).keys())\n\ndef count_primitive_chars_order_dividing_k(k, primes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a square-free\n    conductor d=p1*p2*... whose order divides k.\n    \"\"\"\n    count_per_prime = 1\n    # For a prime p, the number of primitive characters mod p with order dividing k is\n    # gcd(k, p-1) - 1.\n    # For all prime factors of d=53599, p-1 is divisible by k for any k|6.\n    # So gcd(k, p-1) simplifies to k.\n    if k == 0:\n        return 0\n    count_per_prime = k - 1\n    \n    # The total number is the product of counts for each prime factor.\n    return count_per_prime ** len(primes)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n    \n    try:\n        primes = get_prime_factors(d)\n    except NameError:\n        print(\"Please install sympy ('pip install sympy') for prime factorization.\")\n        # Fallback for the specific problem if sympy is not available\n        primes = [7, 13, 19, 31]\n    \n    # Using inclusion-exclusion principle for order g=6.\n    # Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    # Mobius values: mu(6/6)=mu(1)=1, mu(6/3)=mu(2)=-1, mu(6/2)=mu(3)=-1, mu(6/1)=mu(6)=1\n    # Result = 1*N_6 - 1*N_3 - 1*N_2 + 1*N_1\n    \n    n_6 = count_primitive_chars_order_dividing_k(6, primes)\n    n_3 = count_primitive_chars_order_dividing_k(3, primes)\n    n_2 = count_primitive_chars_order_dividing_k(2, primes)\n    n_1 = count_primitive_chars_order_dividing_k(1, primes)\n\n    result = n_6 - n_3 - n_2 + n_1\n\n    print(f\"Let d = {d} and the order be g = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d is: {primes}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of primitive characters with order exactly 6 can be found using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\")\n    print(\"Let N_k be the number of primitive characters with conductor d whose order divides k.\")\n    print(f\"N_6 = (6-1)^{len(primes)} = {n_6}\")\n    print(f\"N_3 = (3-1)^{len(primes)} = {n_3}\")\n    print(f\"N_2 = (2-1)^{len(primes)} = {n_2}\")\n    print(f\"N_1 = (1-1)^{len(primes)} = {n_1}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total number is N_6 - N_3 - N_2 + N_1\")\n    print(f\"= {n_6} - {n_3} - {n_2} + {n_1}\")\n    print(f\"= {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<608>>>"
