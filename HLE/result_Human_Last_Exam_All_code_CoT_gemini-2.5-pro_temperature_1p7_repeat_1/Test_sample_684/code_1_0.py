    This script finds the integer values of n in the range [7, 55] for which it's
    possible to leave exactly one gift on a 5D hypercube.

    The problem is solvable if and only if the size of the hypercube 'n' satisfies
    one of two conditions related to its division by 7. Let n = 7*q + rem.
    The two conditions for solvability are:
    1. The remainder 'rem' is 1, and the quotient 'q' is an even number.
    2. The remainder 'rem' is 6, and the quotient 'q' is an odd number.

    This script iterates through the specified range for n, checks these conditions,
    and prints the values of n that are solutions, along with the reasoning.
