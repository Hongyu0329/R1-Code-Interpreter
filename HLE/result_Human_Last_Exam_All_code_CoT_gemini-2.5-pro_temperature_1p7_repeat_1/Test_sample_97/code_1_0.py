    # We solve the charge balance equation: 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4^-]

    # (1 + K_sp*K_f)x^4 - K_w*x^2 - 3*K_sp = 0
    # Let y = x^2, the equation is ay^2 + by + c = 0, but this is wrong.
    # The equation is a quadratic in y=x^2: ay - by -c =0 is wrong, it is ay^2 + by +c = 0 where y = x^2. NO.
    # Let's recheck the algebra. (1 + K_sp*K_f)x^4 - K_w*x^2 - 3*K_sp = 0.
    # This is a quadratic in y = x^2. The form is ay^2 + by + c. No, the form is ay - b - c = 0... Wait
    # My derivation: (1 + K_sp*K_f)x^4 - K_w*x^2 - 3*K_sp = 0
    # Let y = x^2. Then x^4 = y^2.
