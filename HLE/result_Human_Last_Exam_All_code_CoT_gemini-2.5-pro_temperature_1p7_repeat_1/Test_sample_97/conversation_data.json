    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider all relevant equilibria simultaneously. The solubility, S, is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum species at equilibrium.\n\n### My Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify Chemical Equilibria:**\n    The dissolution of Al(OH)3 is affected by its own solubility and the formation of a complex ion with hydroxide. The autoionization of water is also a factor.\n    *   **Dissolution:** Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        *   K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n    *   **Complex Formation:** Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        *   K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n    *   **Water Autoionization:** H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n        *   K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n2.  **Define Total Solubility (S):**\n    The total solubility is the sum of the concentrations of all aluminum-containing species in the solution.\n    *   S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Establish the Charge Balance Equation:**\n    For any electrolyte solution, the total concentration of positive charges must equal the total concentration of negative charges. This provides a robust equation that must be true at equilibrium.\n    *   Positive charges: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]\n    *   Negative charges: [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n    *   Charge Balance: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknowns:**\n    To solve the system, we will express every concentration in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻]. Let `x = [OH⁻]`.\n    *   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / x\n    *   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / x³\n    *   From K_f and K_sp: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * x⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / x³) * x⁴ = (K_sp * K_f) * x\n\n5.  **Formulate and Solve the Polynomial Equation:**\n    Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n    *   3 * (K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = x + (K_sp * K_f * x)\n    *   Multiplying the entire equation by x³ to clear the denominators gives:\n        3*K_sp + K_w*x² = x⁴ + (K_sp * K_f)*x⁴\n    *   Rearranging this into a standard polynomial form gives:\n        (1 + K_sp*K_f)x⁴ - K_w*x² - 3*K_sp = 0\n    *   This is a quadratic equation in terms of x². Let y = x².\n        a*y² + b*y + c = 0\n        where a = (1 + K_sp*K_f), b = -K_w, and c = -3*K_sp.\n\n6.  **Calculate Final Solubility:**\n    We will use a Python script to solve this quadratic equation for y (which is [OH⁻]²), find the value of [OH⁻], and then calculate the concentrations of [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]. The sum of these concentrations will give the total solubility S.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, considering complex ion formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e31\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n\n    # We solve the charge balance equation: 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n    # Expressing all terms using [OH-] (let x = [OH-]), we get a quadratic equation for x^2.\n    # (1 + K_sp*K_f)x^4 - K_w*x^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n    # Let y = x^2, the equation is ay^2 + by + c = 0, but this is wrong.\n    # The equation is a quadratic in y=x^2: ay - by -c =0 is wrong, it is ay^2 + by +c = 0 where y = x^2.
