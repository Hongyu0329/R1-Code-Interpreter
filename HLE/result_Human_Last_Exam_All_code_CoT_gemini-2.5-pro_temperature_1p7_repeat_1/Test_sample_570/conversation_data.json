    "This problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line `L` from the family of lines `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### Thinking Steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the family of lines:** The lines are `px + qy = 1` where `p, q` are integers with `gcd(p, q) = 1`. This family includes fundamental lines like `x=1` (p=1, q=0), `x=-1` (p=-1, q=0), `y=1` (p=0, q=1), `y=-1` (p=0, q=-1), as well as others like `x+y=1` (p=1, q=1) and `x-y=1` (p=1, q=-1).\n\n2.  **Establish a lower bound for the area:**\n    *   Any convex set `K` that intersects all these lines must, in particular, intersect the four lines `x=1`, `x=-1`, `y=1`, `y=-1`.\n    *   For `K` to intersect both `x=1` and `x=-1`, its projection onto the x-axis must cover the interval `[-1, 1]`. This means the width of `K` in the x-direction, `w_x`, must be at least 2.\n    *   Similarly, for `K` to intersect `y=1` and `y=-1`, its width in the y-direction, `w_y`, must be at least 2.\n    *   The axis-aligned bounding box of `K` is a rectangle with dimensions `w_x` and `w_y`. Its area is `w_x * w_y`, which must be at least `2 * 2 = 4`.\n    *   A known theorem in geometry states that for any convex set `K`, the area of its smallest bounding rectangle (not necessarily axis-aligned) is at most twice the area of `K`. For an axis-aligned bounding box, the same inequality holds: `Area(Bounding Box) <= 2 * Area(K)`.\n    *   Combining these facts: `4 <= Area(Bounding Box) <= 2 * Area(K)`. This implies `Area(K) >= 2`.\n    *   So, the minimal area must be at least 2.\n\n3.  **Find a candidate shape and establish an upper bound:**\n    *   Let's test a simple convex shape. Consider the square with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`. This shape is described by the inequality `|x| + |y| <= 1`.\n    *   Let's check if this diamond-shaped region `D` intersects all lines `px + qy = 1`. A line intersects a convex set if the value `1` is between the minimum and maximum of the linear function `f(x,y) = px + qy` on the set.\n    *   The maximum value of `px+qy` on `D` is `max(|p|, |q|)`. The minimum value is `-max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    *   Since `p` and `q` are coprime, they cannot both be zero. Therefore, `max(|p|, |q|)` must be at least 1.\n    *   The interval of values `px+qy` on `D` is `[-max(|p|,|q|), max(|p|,|q|)]`. Since `max(|p|,|q|) >= 1`, this interval always contains `1`.\n    *   Thus, the diamond `D` intersects every line in the family.\n    *   The area of this diamond gives an upper bound on the minimal area. We can calculate this area. The diagonals are of length 2. The area is `(1/2) * d1 * d2 = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We've shown that the minimal area is at least 2 and we've found a shape with an area of exactly 2 that satisfies the conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\n5.  **Plan for the code:**\n    *   The problem can be solved by calculating the area of the specific shape we identified: the diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, `(0,-1)`.\n    *   I will use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of this polygon from its vertices. The code will print out the calculation steps as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines\n    px+qy=1 for coprime integers p, q.\n\n    The reasoning shows that this minimal area is achieved by the convex set\n    defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.
