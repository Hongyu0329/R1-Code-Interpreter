    "This is a great question that points to a common misconception in the world of mycology. While there are mushrooms that are vividly blue in color, the color of a mushroom's flesh or its bruising reaction is different from its spore print color. No known mushroom genus produces a truly blue spore print.\n\nThe genus you are likely thinking of, which is famous for its distinct blue color, is *Lactarius*. The Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*) is a striking blue mushroom that bleeds blue latex \"milk\" when cut. However, its spore print is actually cream to yellowish.\n\nI will write a Python script that contains this mycological information and programmatically searches for a genus with a blue spore print to demonstrate that none exists in the dataset and to provide the correct information about the likely candidate, *Lactarius*.\n\n```python\ndef find_blue_spore_print_mushroom():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches a small mycological knowledge base to address the question\n    of a mushroom genus with a blue spore print.
