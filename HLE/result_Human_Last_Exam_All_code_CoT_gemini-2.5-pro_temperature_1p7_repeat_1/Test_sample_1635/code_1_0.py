    # Step 1 & 2: Determine the set of prime periods greater than 1, P_prime_gt1.
    # The problem statement implies that a prime period of 13 exists, but a prime period of 11 does not.
    # By Sharkovsky's Theorem, the absence of period 11 implies the absence of periods 3, 5, 7, and 9.
    # The presence of period 13 implies the presence of all periods 'weaker' than 13 in the
    # Sharkovsky ordering. This includes all even numbers and all odd numbers >= 15.
    # So, the set of prime periods greater than 1, which we call P_prime_gt1, is:
    # {all even numbers} U {13} U {all odd numbers >= 15}.

        if p <= 1:

            return True  # All evens are in.
        if p == 13:
            return True  # 13 is in.
        if p % 2 != 0 and p >= 15:
            return True  # All odds >= 15 are in.
        return False

    # Step 3: Characterize the set S.
    # A point of order k exists if and only if k is divisible by some p in P_prime_gt1.
    # Therefore, k is in S if and only if k is NOT divisible by any p in P_prime_gt1.

    # Step 4: Find the elements of S.
    # For k to be in S:
    # 1. k cannot be divisible by any even number in P_prime_gt1. This means k must be odd.
    # 2. k cannot be divisible by any odd number in P_prime_gt1.
    #    The odd numbers in P_prime_gt1 are {13, 15, 17, ...}.
    #    If k is an odd number >= 13, it is either 13 (divisible by 13) or it is >= 15,
    #    in which case it is divisible by itself, and k itself is in P_prime_gt1.
    #    So, any k in S must be an odd number strictly less than 13.
    
    # We find all odd integers k < 13.
    S = [k for k in range(1, 13) if k % 2 != 0]

    # Now, we print the results as requested.
    print("The set S contains numbers k for which there is no point of order k.")
    print("Based on the problem's conditions and Sharkovsky's theorem, we found that S must contain only odd numbers less than 13.")
