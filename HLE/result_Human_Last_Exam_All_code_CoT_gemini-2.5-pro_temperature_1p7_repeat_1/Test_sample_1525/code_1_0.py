def count_correct_statements():
    """
    This function analyzes five statements about a mathematical claim related to Datalog programs.

    Here is a summary of the analysis for each statement:
    - Statement A: Correct. It points out that the recursive definition of segregation (`P_k`) is ill-defined. The formula has a type mismatch and relies on a non-semantic ordering of constants from the program's text, which is a valid critique of the claim's formalism.
    - Statement B: Incorrect. It begins by misrepresenting the claim. The claim is a set of two equalities, not the single simple equality `gamma[gamma^-1[P]] = P` that statement B claims it is.
    - Statement C: Incorrect. This statement is about the composition of operators `gamma^-1[gamma[P]]`, whereas the claim involves `gamma[gamma^-1[P]]`. Furthermore, it discusses a scenario (losing information during aggregation) that the claim's premise `gamma[P] = P` is designed to prevent. Therefore, it's not directly about the provided claim.
    - Statement D: Correct. Similar to statement A, it correctly points out that the ambiguous and order-dependent definition of segregation would also apply to the initial set of facts, `S_0`. This is another valid critique of the formalism.
    - Statement E: Correct. This statement accurately provides a high-level, conceptual summary of the claim's meaning. The equation `gamma[gamma^-1[P](gamma^-1[S_0])] = P(S_0)` is indeed a statement about the equivalence between coarse-grained inference and a cycle of refining, inferring, and then coarsening the result.

    Based on the analysis, statements A, D, and E are correct.
