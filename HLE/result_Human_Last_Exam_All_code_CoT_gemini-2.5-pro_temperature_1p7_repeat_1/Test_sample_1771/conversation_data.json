    "This is a historical linguistics problem that involves tracing a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb through its descendants in the Germanic language family. My plan is to apply the known, regular sound changes that occurred between each stage of the languages.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc.):** I will start with the PIE form `*seh₂gieti`. I will apply the key sound laws that define the transition to Proto-Germanic. This involves resolving the laryngeal (`*h₂`), which affects the preceding vowel, and applying Grimm's Law to the consonants.\n2.  **Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages:** From the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form, I will then apply the specific sound changes for each requested language:\n    *   **Old Norse:** This will involve i-umlaut, a sound change where a back vowel is fronted when followed by an /i/ or /j/ in the next syllable.\n    *   **Old English:** This also involves i-umlaut, as well as the palatalization of velar consonants (like 'k') before front vowels.\n    *   **Old High German:** This involves i-umlaut and, most significantly, the High German Consonant Shift (or Second Sound Shift), which alters consonants differently than in other Germanic languages.\n\nThe script below will outline these changes and print the resulting form for each language in the derivational chain.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces a PIE verb through its Germanic descendants by printing the forms at each stage.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the forms for each stage of the language evolution\n    pie_form = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    proto_germanic_form = \"*sōkiþi\"\n    old_norse_form = \"sǿkir\"\n    old_english_form = \"sēceþ\"\n    old_high_german_form = \"suohhit\"\n\n    print(\"This script traces the PIE verb *seh₂gieti ('(s)he seeks/perceives') through its descendants in Germanic languages.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"The derivation begins with the Proto-Indo-European form: {pie_form}\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
