# Number of equations in the first group (Type 1)
num_type1_equations = 2024

# Number of solvability conditions for each Type 1 equation
# This arises from needing the solution to be bounded at both +infinity and -infinity.
conditions_per_type1_eq = 2

# The equations in the second group (Type 2) have bounded homogeneous solutions,
# so the arbitrary constant can be used to satisfy the boundary condition
# without needing extra solvability conditions.
conditions_per_type2_eq = 0

# Calculate the total number of conditions
total_conditions = num_type1_equations * conditions_per_type1_eq

# Output the calculation and the final answer
print(f"{num_type1_equations} * {conditions_per_type1_eq} = {total_conditions}")
