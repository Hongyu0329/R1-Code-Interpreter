# Based on the step-by-step analysis, the complex problem simplifies considerably.
# The value of the function l(b) is found to be a constant for any b in the domain (-1, 1).

# Step 1-5 from the explanation lead to the conclusion that l(b) simplifies to a constant value.
# The infimum part of the expression for l(b) evaluates to 0.
# The expression for l(b) thus becomes 0 + 101.
l_b_val = 101

# The problem asks for the computation of 6 * (l(1/2) + l(-1/2)).
# Since l(b) is a constant 101 for any valid b, we have:
l_half = l_b_val
l_neg_half = l_b_val

# Final calculation
result = 6 * (l_half + l_neg_half)

# As requested, printing the equation with the numbers.
print(f"{6} * ({l_half} + {l_neg_half}) = {result}")
