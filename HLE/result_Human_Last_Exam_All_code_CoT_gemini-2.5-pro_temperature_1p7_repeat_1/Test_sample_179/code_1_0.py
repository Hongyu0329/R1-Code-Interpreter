# Define the constants from the problem statement
A = 10**10
B = 1/100000 - 1
T = 10**20

# As derived in the thinking steps, the solution for X_0(t) is a constant function
# determined by the differential equation X'_0(t) = -(B + 1)X_0(t) + A
# and the boundary condition X_0(0) = X_0(T).
# The solution is X_0(t) = A / (B + 1).

# Let's calculate the value for B + 1
lambda_val = B + 1

# Calculate the value of the solution X_0(t) at t = T
X_0_at_T = A / lambda_val

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation can be represented as X_0(T) = A / (B + 1).
# We print the result of this calculation.
