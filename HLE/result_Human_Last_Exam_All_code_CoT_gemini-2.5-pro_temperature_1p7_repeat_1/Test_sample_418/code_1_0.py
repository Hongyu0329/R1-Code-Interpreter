# The total space X is a disjoint union of five component spaces.
# As established in the reasoning, any auto-homeomorphism of X must map
# each of the five components to itself, because they are all topologically distinct.
# Therefore, the total number of equivalence classes in X is the sum of the
# number of equivalence classes in each component space.

# An equivalence class in a space is a set of points that can be mapped to each other
# by some auto-homeomorphism. A space where all points belong to a single
# equivalence class is called homogeneous.

# 1. Number of classes in the Torus
# The torus is a homogeneous space. For any two points, a translation (which is a
# homeomorphism) exists that maps one to the other.
num_classes_torus = 1

# 2. Number of classes in the Sphere
# The sphere is homogeneous. For any two points, a rotation (a homeomorphism)
# can map one to the other.
num_classes_sphere = 1

# 3. Number of classes in the Real Line
# The real line is homogeneous. A translation f(z) = z + c maps any point to any other.
num_classes_real_line = 1

# 4. Number of classes in a three-point discrete space
# In a discrete space, any permutation of points is a homeomorphism. Thus, all
# points are equivalent. The space is homogeneous.
num_classes_discrete_3 = 1

# 5. Number of classes in a five-point discrete space
# Similar to the 3-point discrete space, this space is also homogeneous.
num_classes_discrete_5 = 1

# Calculate the total number of equivalence classes by summing them up.
total_classes = (num_classes_torus +
                 num_classes_sphere +
                 num_classes_real_line +
                 num_classes_discrete_3 +
                 num_classes_discrete_5)

# Print the final equation showing how the total is calculated.
print("The total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the classes from each component.")
