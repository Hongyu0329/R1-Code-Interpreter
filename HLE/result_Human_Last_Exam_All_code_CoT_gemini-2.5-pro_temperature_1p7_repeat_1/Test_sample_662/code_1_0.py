# Define the given parameters based on the problem description.
# Ro is the basic reproduction number of the virus.
Ro = 3.0
# breakthrough_rate_percent is the percentage of vaccinated people who still get infected.
breakthrough_rate_percent = 6.0

# Convert percentage to a decimal for calculation.
breakthrough_rate_decimal = breakthrough_rate_percent / 100

print("To solve this, we will follow three main steps:\n")

# Step 1: Calculate the Vaccine Efficacy (VE).
# Vaccine Efficacy is the reduction in infection risk for vaccinated people.
# If 6% of vaccinated people get infected, the vaccine is 94% effective.
VE = 1 - breakthrough_rate_decimal

print(f"The vaccine is effective in preventing infection in {VE:.0%} of cases.")
print(f"VE = 1 - {breakthrough_rate_decimal} = {VE:.2f}\n")


# Step 2: Calculate the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT).
# HIT is the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to stop the spread.
# The formula is HIT = 1 - (1 / Ro).
HIT = 1 - (1 / Ro)
print(f"Step 2: Calculate Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT)")
print(f"With a basic reproduction number (Ro) of {Ro}, the proportion of the population that needs to be immune is {HIT:.2%}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the Critical Vaccination Coverage (Vc).
# This is the proportion of the population we need to vaccinate to achieve herd immunity,
# accounting for the vaccine's effectiveness.
# The formula is Vc = HIT / VE.
Vc = HIT / VE
Vc_percent = Vc * 100

print(f"Step 3: Calculate the required vaccination coverage threshold (Vc)")
print("To find the coverage needed, we divide the herd immunity threshold by the vaccine's efficacy.\n")
print(f"The final calculation is:")
print(f"Vaccination Coverage = (1 - 1 / {Ro}) / {VE:.2f}")
print(f"Vaccination Coverage = {HIT:.4f} / {VE:.2f}")
print(f"Vaccination Coverage = {Vc:.4f}\n")

print(f"Therefore, the theoretical threshold of vaccine coverage required is {Vc_percent:.2f}%.")
