# The problem asks for the limiting probability P(n) that for a random DNA sequence
# of length n with 8 bases, the count of each base Nx satisfies Nx mod 8 != x for all x in {0..7}.
# As derived in the reasoning, this limiting probability is the Cesaro mean of an oscillating
# sequence, which simplifies to the expression (7/8)^8.

# Define the numbers in the final equation
base = 8
success_outcomes_per_base = 7
num_bases = 8

# Calculate the numerator and denominator of the final probability
numerator = success_outcomes_per_base ** num_bases
denominator = base ** num_bases

# Calculate the final probability
probability = numerator / denominator

# Output the equation and its numerical value, showing each number involved.
print("The closed form expression for the limiting value of P(n) is:")
print(f"P = ({success_outcomes_per_base}/{base})^{num_bases}")

print(f"P = {probability}")

# Return the final answer in the specified format
