    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points**: We need to find the points $(u, d)$ in the phase plane where both $u'(t)$ and $d'(t)$ are zero.\n2.  **Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points**: We will compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate it at each equilibrium point to determine its stability (e.g., node, saddle, focus).\n3.  **Identify the separatrix**: A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Often, the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points serve as separatrices. We will look for a saddle point and determine its manifolds.\n4.  **Find the equation of the separatrix**: We will try to find an analytical expression for the separatrix. We can test for a simple functional form, like a polynomial, that satisfies the system's equations and passes through the saddle point.\n\n**Step 1: Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nSet $u'(t)=0$:\n$(u-1)u^2 = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow substitute these values into $d'(t)=0$:\n*   If $u=0$: $2d^2 - 0 = 0 \\implies d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $u=1$: $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives two equilibrium points: **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**Step 2: Stability Analysis**\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n$J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ -3d+10ud-3u^2+4u^3 & 4d-3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   At **(1, -1)**:\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ -3(-1)+10(1)(-1)-3(1)^2+4(1)^3 & 4(-1)-3(1)+5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the equilibrium point (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Separatrix**\n\nThe unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$ is a key candidate for the separatrix. This manifold is a trajectory curve that emanates from the saddle point.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Equation of the Separatrix**\n\nWe look for an invariant manifold of the form $d=f(u)$. Let's assume the separatrix is a polynomial of the form $d = au^2 + bu + c$. By substituting this into the system's equations, $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{dd}{du} \\frac{du}{dt}$, and comparing the polynomial coefficients in $u$, we find two invariant manifolds: $d = u-u^2$ and $d = -u^2$.\n\nWe must identify which one corresponds to the separatrix originating from the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n*   The curve $d=u-u^2$ passes through $(1,0)$, which is not the saddle point.\n*   The curve $d=-u^2$ passes through $(1, -1)$, since $-1 = -(1)^2$. This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThe eigenvector for the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$ at $(1,-1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, which means the slope of the unstable manifold at the saddle point is $-2$.\nThe slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2(1)=-2$.\nThis confirms that the separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\nThe following Python code prints the equation for the separatrix.\n\n```python\n# The system of differential equations is:\n# d'(t) = 2*d(t)**2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)**2)*d(t) - u(t)*(1 - u(t))*u(t)**2\n# u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)*u(t)**2\n\n# Through analysis of the system's dynamics, we have identified the equilibrium points\n# and their stability. The point (1, -1) is a saddle point. The separatrix\n# is the unstable manifold of this saddle point.\n\n# We found that the separatrix is described by a parabolic equation d = a*u**2 + b*u + c.\n# The coefficients for this parabola were found to be:\na = -1\nb = 0\nc = 0\n\n# We print the equation of the separatrix, including each coefficient as requested.\nprint(\"The equation of the separatrix is a curve in the (u, d) phase plane.\")\nprint(f\"The equation is: d = ({a}) * u^2 + ({b}) * u + ({c})\")\nprint(\"Simplified, the equation is: d = -u^2\")\n\n```\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
