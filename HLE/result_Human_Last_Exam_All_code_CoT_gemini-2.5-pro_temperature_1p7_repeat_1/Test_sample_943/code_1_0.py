# The problem asks to find the value of K in the slice rank formula.
# The slice rank is given by SR = (3 / (2**K))**n * exp(o(n)).
# This means the base of the exponential growth is rho = 3 / (2**K).

# From the analysis of the tensor T_n, its asymptotic slice rank has a base of 2.
# We set the given base equal to the derived base to solve for K.

# The equation is: 3 / (2**K) = 2

# 3 = 2 * 2**K
# 3/2 = 2**K
