    "My plan is to determine the value of $K$ by first identifying the asymptotic base of the slice rank for the given tensor.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Tensor**: The given tensor is defined by the function $T_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. This can be expressed as the difference of two simpler tensors: $U_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ and $J_n(x,y,z) = 1$. So, $T_n = U_n - J_n$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Component Tensors**:\n    *   $U_n$ is the $n$-th tensor power of the base tensor $U_1(x,y,z) = x+y+z$.\n    *   $J_n$ is the tensor corresponding to the constant function 1. It has a rank of 1, and therefore a slice rank of 1.\n\n3.  **Determine Asymptotic Slice Rank**: The slice rank of a sum of tensors $A+B$ is at most the sum of their individual slice ranks, SR($A$) + SR($B$). For our tensor, SR($T_n$) ≤ SR($U_n$) + SR($J_n$).\n    *   A known result in tensor theory states that the slice rank of the tensor $U_n = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ is exactly $2^n$.\n    *   Since SR($J_n$) = 1, we have an upper bound SR($T_n$) ≤ $2^n + 1$.\n    *   For large $n$, the term '1' is negligible, and the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank of $T_n$ is dominated by the $2^n$ term. Subtracting a rank-1 tensor does not alter the exponential base of the asymptotic slice rank. Thus, the base of the slice rank growth is 2.\n\n4.  **Solve for K**: The problem states the slice rank is of the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. This implies the base of the exponential growth is $\\rho = 3/2^K$.\n    *   By equating the derived base with the given one, we get the equation: $3/2^K = 2$.\n    *   Solving for $K$:\n        $3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K$\n        $3/2 = 2^K$\n        $K = \\log_2(3/2) = \\log_2(3) - 1$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Value**: I will use a Python script to calculate the numerical value of $K = \\log_2(3) - 1$ and show the steps of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks to find the value of K in the slice rank formula.\n# The slice rank is given by SR = (3 / (2**K))**n * exp(o(n)).\n# This means the base of the exponential growth is rho = 3 / (2**K).\n\n# From the analysis of the tensor T_n, its asymptotic slice rank has a base of 2.\n# We set the given base equal to the derived base to solve for K.\n\n# The equation is: 3 / (2**K) = 2\nnumerator = 3\nbase_rho = 2\n\nprint(\"The equation to solve for K is:\")\nprint(f\"{numerator} / (2**K) = {base_rho}\")\n\n# Rearranging the equation to solve for K:\n# 3 = 2 * 2**K\n# 3/2 = 2**K\n# K = log2(3/2)\n\nprint(\"\\nSolving for K:\")\nvalue_rhs = numerator / base_rho\nprint(f\"2**K = {numerator} / {base_rho}\")\nprint(f\"2**K = {value_rhs}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTaking the logarithm base 2 on both sides:\")\nprint(\"K = log2(3/2)\")\nprint(\"This can also be written as: K = log2(3) - log2(2)\")\n\n# Calculate the value\nlog_val_3 = math.log2(3)\nlog_val_2 = math.log2(2)\nk_value = log_val_3 - log_val_2\n\nprint(f\"\\nCalculating the numerical value:\")\nprint(f\"K = {log_val_3} - {log_val_2}\")\nprint(f\"K = {k_value}\")\n```\n<<<0.5849625007211562>>>"
