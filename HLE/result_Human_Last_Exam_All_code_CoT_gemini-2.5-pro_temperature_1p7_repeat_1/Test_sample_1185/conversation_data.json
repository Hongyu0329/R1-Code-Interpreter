    "The problem asks for the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2. This is a question from algebraic geometry, and the answer corresponds to the number of distinct combinatorial types of singular stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. These types are classified by the boundary strata of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of curves of genus 2.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first determine the number of boundary strata of codimension 1. The number of such strata for a curve of genus `g` is given by a known formula, `floor(g/2) + 1`.\n2.  Next, I will state the number of boundary strata of codimension 2. This is a known result from the study of the moduli space of curves, which is 3 for genus 2.\n3.  The total number of types of stable reduction is the sum of these numbers.\n4.  I will write a Python script that implements this logic, calculates the sum, and prints out the components of the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_stable_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n    In algebraic geometry, the types of stable reduction for a curve of genus g correspond\n    to the boundary strata of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of curves, M_g_bar.\n    The total number of types is the sum of the number of strata of each codimension. For genus 2,\n    the boundary is composed of strata of codimension 1 and 2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The genus of the curve in question.\n    g = 2\n\n    # Step 1: Count the number of types of codimension 1 strata.\n    # These are the main \"ways\" a curve can degenerate. The number of these irreducible boundary\n    # components (called divisors) is given by the formula floor(g/2) + 1.\n    # For g=2, these two types are:\n    #   1. An irreducible curve with one node.\n    #   2. A reducible curve made of two genus 1 curves meeting at a point.\n    codim_1_types = math.floor(g / 2) + 1\n\n    # Step 2: Count the number of types of codimension 2 strata.\n    # These represent further degenerations. For genus 2, a full analysis of the\n    # geometry of the moduli space shows there are exactly 3 types of these strata.\n    # These three types are:\n    #   1. An irreducible curve of genus 0 with two nodes.\n    #   2. A reducible curve made of a genus 1 curve attached to a genus 0 curve with one node.\n    #   3. A reducible curve made of two genus 0 curves with one node each, attached to each other.\n    codim_2_types = 3\n\n    # Step 3: The total number of types is the sum of the counts from all codimensions.\n    total_types = codim_1_types + codim_2_types\n\n    print(\"The total number of stable reduction types for a curve of genus 2 is the sum of the types from different codimensions.\")\n    print(f\"Number of codimension 1 types: {codim_1_types}\")\n    print(f\"Number of codimension 2 types: {codim_2_types}\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {codim_1_types} + {codim_2_types} = {total_types}\")\n\ncount_stable_reduction_types()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
