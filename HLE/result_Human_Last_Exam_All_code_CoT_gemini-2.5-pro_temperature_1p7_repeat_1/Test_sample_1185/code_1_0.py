    Calculates the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.

    In algebraic geometry, the types of stable reduction for a curve of genus g correspond
    to the boundary strata of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of curves, M_g_bar.
    The total number of types is the sum of the number of strata of each codimension. For genus 2,
    the boundary is composed of strata of codimension 1 and 2.

    # These are the main "ways" a curve can degenerate. The number of these irreducible boundary
    # components (called divisors) is given by the formula floor(g/2) + 1.

    # geometry of the moduli space shows there are exactly 3 types of these strata.
