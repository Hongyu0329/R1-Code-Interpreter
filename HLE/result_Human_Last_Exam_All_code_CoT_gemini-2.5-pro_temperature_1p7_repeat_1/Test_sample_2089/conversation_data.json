    "Of course. My plan is to first identify the movie and the specific scene based on your description. Then, I will write a Python script to output the answer. To satisfy the unusual requirement for an equation, I will incorporate numerical trivia about the film's Oscar nominations and wins into a simple subtraction problem, ensuring each number in the equation is printed.\n\n```python\ndef solve_movie_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the film and provides details along with a\n    numerical equation based on the film's award history.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"The Fugitive\"\n    character = \"Dr. Charles Nichols\"\n    context = \"He says 'Thank you' while getting on a Chicago bus, which ultimately leads to his capture by Dr. Richard Kimble.\"\n\n    # To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an equation,\n    # we'll use the film's Oscar statistics: 7 nominations and 1 win.\n    oscar_nominations = 7\n    oscar_wins = 1\n    other_nominations = oscar_nominations - oscar_wins\n\n    print(f\"The film you are asking about is '{film_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"The character is {character}, who seals his fate with this action.\")\n    print(context)\n    print(\"\\nAs requested, here is an equation related to the film's Oscar performance:\")\n    # The final print statement outputs each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"Nominations ({oscar_nominations}) - Unsuccessful Nominations ({other_nominations}) = Wins ({oscar_wins})\")\n\nsolve_movie_query()\n```\n<<<The Fugitive>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
