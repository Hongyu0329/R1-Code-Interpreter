    Analyzes the properties of the set S.

    The properties given are:
    1. Open
    2. Closed
    3. Connected
    4. Compact
    5. Dense
    6. Connected complement
    7. Trivial first singular homology group

    Our analysis leads to the following conclusions:
    - S is always open.
    - S is not always closed (e.g., f(x)=|x| gives S = R\{0}).
    - S is not always connected (e.g., S = R\{0}).
    - S is not always compact (e.g., S = R\{0} or S = R^n).
    - S is always dense. This is a deeper result, relying on the fact that the initial property is very restrictive and forces "non-isometry" points to form a "small" set (not containing any open ball).
    - S does not always have a connected complement (e.g., a triangle-wave function gives S = R\Z, whose complement Z is not connected).
    - S does not always have a trivial first singular homology group (e.g., if S = R^2\{0}).

    Therefore, exactly two properties must always hold for S.
