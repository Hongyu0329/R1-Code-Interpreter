    "To find the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body, we will use the Schwarzschild metric and the formula for Christoffel symbols. I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations, which minimizes the chance of manual error.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$ and constants symbolically. For simplicity, I'll use geometric units ($G=c=1$) where the Schwarzschild radius is $r_s = 2M$.\n2.  Represent the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ as a symbolic matrix in `sympy`.\n3.  Calculate the inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n4.  Compute all first-order partial derivatives of the metric tensor components with respect to each coordinate, i.e., $\\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n5.  Systematically calculate each Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ by implementing its formula: $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$. This involves iterating through all 64 possible combinations of the indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$.\n6.  For each symbol, simplify the resulting expression. If it's not zero, increment a counter.\n7.  Finally, the script will print each of the non-zero symbols and their calculated expressions, followed by the total count. This addresses the request to \"output each number in the final equation\" by showing the full formula for each non-zero component.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef count_nonzero_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric\n    and counts how many of them are non-zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define symbolic variables\n    # Using t, r, theta, phi for coordinates.\n    # Using M for mass.
