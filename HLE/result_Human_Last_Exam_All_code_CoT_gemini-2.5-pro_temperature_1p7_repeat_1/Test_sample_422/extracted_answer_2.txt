Ignoring Gettier problems, the two main issues with the JTB definition of knowledge are the infinite regress of justification and the problem of confirming truth.

1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification**: This problem attacks the "J" (Justified) in JTB. It argues that for any belief to be justified, its justification must also be justified. For instance, if you believe 'P' is true because of justification 'J1', you must also be justified in believing 'J1'. This requires a further justification, 'J2', for 'J1', a 'J3' for 'J2', and so on, creating an infinite and endless chain of justifications. Since it's impossible to complete an infinite series, no belief can ever be fully justified, and thus no knowledge is possible under this strict requirement.

2.  **The Problem of Confirming Truth**: This problem attacks the "T" (True) in JTB. It states that for a belief to be knowledge, it must correspond to objective reality. However, as finite human beings, we can never be absolutely certain that our perception of reality is perfect. Our senses can be deceived and our reasoning can be flawed. We can gather strong evidence and feel very justified in a belief, but we can't step outside of our own subjective experience to confirm with absolute certainty that the belief is true. This makes the "True" condition an ideal that is impossible to ever fully confirm, thereby making it impossible to be certain we have achieved "Knowledge".
