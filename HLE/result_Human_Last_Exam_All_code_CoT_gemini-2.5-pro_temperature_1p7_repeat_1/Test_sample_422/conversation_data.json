    "Ignoring Gettier problems, the Justified True Belief (JTB) model of knowledge runs into two significant philosophical problems.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the two problems:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification**: For a belief to be considered knowledge under JTB, it must be justified. The problem arises when we question what justifies the justification itself. If every justification requires another justification, we fall into an infinite regress. For example, if I know P because of reason J1, I must also know that J1 is a good reason. To know J1, I need another reason, J2, and so on forever. Since we can never complete an infinite chain of justifications, we can never truly have the \"J\" required for knowledge.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Confirming Truth**: JTB requires that a belief must be objectively true. However, as subjective observers, we can never be absolutely certain that our belief corresponds perfectly to reality. Our access to the world is mediated by our senses and cognitive faculties, which can be flawed or tricked. We can have very strong evidence for a belief (a strong justification), but we cannot step outside of our own minds to compare the belief directly with reality. This makes the \"T\" condition practically impossible to ever confirm with 100% certainty from our perspective.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the first problem, the infinite regress of justification, by using a recursive function that calls itself in an endless loop to find a root justification.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_jtb_regress(belief_name, justification_level=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the infinite regress problem of JTB justification.\n    To know a belief, its justification must also be known, which requires another\n    justification, leading to an endless chain.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Define the current justification in the chain, e.g., J1, J2, etc.\n        current_justification_name = f\"J{justification_level}\"\n\n        # Explain the current step in the regress\n        print(f\"Step {justification_level}: To KNOW '{belief_name}', our belief must be justified by '{current_justification_name}'.\")\n        print(f\"   - But for '{current_justification_name}' to be valid, we must first KNOW that it is true.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n        # The regress: We now need to find the justification for our justification.\n        # This is represented by calling the function again for the justification itself.\n        demonstrate_jtb_regress(current_justification_name, justification_level + 1)\n\n    except RecursionError:\n        # Python has a recursion limit, which we use here to represent an infinite process\n        print(f\"Step {justification_level}: To KNOW 'J{justification_level-1}', we need 'J{justification_level}'...\")\n        print(\"\\nAnd so on, ad infinitum.\")\n        print(\"This endless chain is the 'Infinite Regress Problem'.\")\n        print(\"We've hit Python's recursion limit, which simulates our inability to ever find a final, foundational justification.\")\n\n# Let's start with an initial proposition \"P\" that we want to know.\ninitial_belief = \"The sun will rise tomorrow\"\nprint(\"Demonstrating the 'Infinite Regress Problem' of Justification:\\n\")\ndemonstrate_jtb_regress(initial_belief)\n```\n<<<Ignoring Gettier problems, the two main issues with the JTB definition of knowledge are the infinite regress of justification and the problem of confirming truth.\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification**: This problem attacks the \"J\" (Justified) in JTB. It argues that for any belief to be justified, its justification must also be justified. For instance, if you believe 'P' is true because of justification 'J1', you must also be justified in believing 'J1'. This requires a further justification, 'J2', for 'J1', a 'J3' for 'J2', and so on, creating an infinite and endless chain of justifications. Since it's impossible to complete an infinite series, no belief can ever be fully justified, and thus no knowledge is possible under this strict requirement.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Confirming Truth**: This problem attacks the \"T\" (True) in JTB. It states that for a belief to be knowledge, it must correspond to objective reality. However, as finite human beings, we can never be absolutely certain that our perception of reality is perfect. Our senses can be deceived and our reasoning can be flawed. We can gather strong evidence and feel very justified in a belief, but we can't step outside of our own subjective experience to confirm with absolute certainty that the belief is true. This makes the \"True\" condition an ideal that is impossible to ever fully confirm, thereby making it impossible to be certain we have achieved \"Knowledge\".>>>"
