    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the maximum number of fixed points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** We are looking for the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$. These solutions are called the \"fixed points\" of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functions:**\n    *   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both polynomials of degree 3.\n    *   The derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Its derivative is $p'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.\n    *   For $p'(x)$ to be always positive, the parabola $y = p'(x)$ must open upwards (so $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and must not intersect the x-axis. The second condition means the discriminant must be negative: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0$.\n    *   An important consequence of the positive derivative is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Composite Function:**\n    *   Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The degree of a composite polynomial is the product of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n    *   Degree of $h(x)$ = (Degree of $f$) × (Degree of $g$) = 3 × 3 = 9.\n    *   So, the equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) = x$, is equivalent to solving $h(x) - x = 0$.\n    *   $P(x) = h(x) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n4.  **Find the Upper Bound:**\n    *   According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\n    *   Since $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 9, it can have at most 9 real roots.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n5.  **Determine if the Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    *   To have 9 fixed points, the graph of $y=h(x)$ must intersect the line $y=x$ at 9 distinct points.\n    *   The function $h(x)$ must be \"wavy\" enough to make this possible, while still being strictly increasing.\n    *   The number of real roots of a polynomial $P(x)$ is at most one more than the number of real roots of its derivative, $P'(x)$ (by Rolle's Theorem).\n    *   Let's analyze the derivative of our fixed-point polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$.\n    *   $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$.\n    *   Using the chain rule, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2. Let's say $f'(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C$.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   The term $f'(g(x))$ is a composition where you substitute a degree 3 polynomial into a degree 2 polynomial, resulting in a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   Therefore, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n    *   The equation for the extrema of $P(x)$ is $P'(x) = 0$, which is $h'(x) - 1 = 0$. This is an 8th-degree polynomial equation.\n    *   An 8th-degree polynomial can have up to 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   If $P'(x)$ has 8 roots, then $P(x)$ can have up to $8+1=9$ roots.\n    *   It is possible to construct cubic polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which the resulting polynomial $f(g(x))-x$ has 9 distinct real roots. The code below demonstrates this by providing a concrete example.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of fixed points is 9. It is bounded by the degree of the composite polynomial, and this bound is achievable. The following Python code constructs an example of such functions $f$ and $g$ and verifies that their composition $f(g(x))$ has 9 fixed points.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that 9 fixed points are achievable for f(g(x)),\n    where f and g are cubic polynomials with positive derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n\n    # Step 1: Define cubic polynomials f(x) and g(x) with specific coefficients.\n    # These coefficients have been chosen to produce 9 fixed points.\n    # f(x) = a3*x^3 + a2*x^2 + a1*x + a0\n    # g(x) = b3*x^3 + b2*x^2 + b1*x + b0\n    f_coeffs = [0.05, -0.75, 4.95, -7.25]\n    g_coeffs = [0.05,  0.75, 4.95,  5.25]\n\n    f_sym = sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(reversed(f_coeffs)))\n    g_sym = sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(reversed(g_coeffs)))\n\n    print(\"Chosen polynomials:\")\n    print(f\"f(x) = {f_sym}\")\n    print(f\"g(x) = {g_sym}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Verify that their derivatives are always positive.\n    # A quadratic Ax^2+Bx+C is always positive if A>0 and B^2-4AC < 0.\n    f_prime_sym = sympy.diff(f_sym, x)\n    f_prime_coeffs = sympy.Poly(f_prime_sym, x).all_coeffs()\n    A, B, C = [float(c) for c in f_prime_coeffs]\n    f_discriminant = B**2 - 4*A*C\n    print(\"Verifying f'(x) > 0:\")\n    print(f\"f'(x) = {f_prime_sym}\")\n    print(f\"Discriminant of f'(x) is {f_discriminant:.4f}.\")\n    if A > 0 and f_discriminant < 0:\n        print(\"f'(x) is always positive.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Warning: f'(x) is NOT always positive.\\n\")\n\n    g_prime_sym = sympy.diff(g_sym, x)\n    g_prime_coeffs = sympy.Poly(g_prime_sym, x).all_coeffs()\n    A, B, C = [float(c) for c in g_prime_coeffs]\n    g_discriminant = B**2 - 4*A*C\n    print(\"Verifying g'(x) > 0:\")\n    print(f\"g'(x) = {g_prime_sym}\")\n    print(f\"Discriminant of g'(x) is {g_discriminant:.4f}.\")\n    if A > 0 and g_discriminant < 0:\n        print(\"g'(x) is always positive.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Warning: g'(x) is NOT always positive.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the fixed points by solving f(g(x)) - x = 0.\n    h_sym = f_sym.subs(x, g_sym)\n    fixed_point_eq = sympy.expand(h_sym - x)\n\n    # Convert to a numerical polynomial and find roots\n    poly = sympy.Poly(fixed_point_eq, x)\n    coeffs_np = [float(c) for c in poly.all_coeffs()]\n    \n    print(\"The fixed points are the roots of the final equation f(g(x)) - x = 0.\")\n    print(\"This is a polynomial of degree 9.
