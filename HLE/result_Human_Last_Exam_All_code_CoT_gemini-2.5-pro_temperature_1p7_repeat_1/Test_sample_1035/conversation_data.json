    "This problem asks for the minimum size of a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$. While the question uses the term \"minimum number of vertices\", in the context of graph decomposition problems, this is most likely a slight misstatement of the actual, classic problem, which is about the \"minimum number of *graphs*\". A literal interpretation of the question leads to a trivial answer ($n$), whereas the interpretation as \"number of graphs\" refers to a famous result in graph theory. The instruction to provide the final equation also supports this interpretation.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Re-interpret the question:** The user is likely asking for the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to cover all edges of $K_n$.\n2.  **State the relevant theorem:** The Graham-Pollak theorem (and its generalization by Tverberg) states that the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs whose edges cover the complete graph $K_n$ is $n-1$.\n3.  **Apply the theorem:** For $n = 35$, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required is $35 - 1 = 34$.\n4.  **Construct the code:** Write a simple Python script to calculate this result and print the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover the complete graph K_n.\n\n    The problem asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\"\n    covering K_n. This is likely a slightly ambiguous phrasing for a classic problem in\n    combinatorics. The standard problem asks for the minimum number of bipartite *graphs*\n    in such a family.\n\n    A literal interpretation (\"minimum number of vertices in the union of vertex sets\") would\n    trivially result in n, since all vertices must be present to cover all edges incident to them.\n\n    The more profound and likely intended question refers to the number of graphs. According to a\n    theorem by Graham, Pollak, and Tverberg, the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to\n    cover all edges of a complete graph K_n is exactly n-1.\n\n    The question asks to provide the final equation. For n=35, the equation is 35 - 1 = 34.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the complete graph K_n.\n    n = 35\n\n    # According to the theorem, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required is n - 1.\n    result = n - 1\n\n    # Print the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<34>>>"
