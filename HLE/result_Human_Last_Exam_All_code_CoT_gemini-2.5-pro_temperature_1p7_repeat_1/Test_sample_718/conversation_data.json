    "Here are the thinking steps to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The user is asking for the integer `n` for which a \"tame functor\" `f` from an \"upper semilattice\" `J` to the category of vector spaces is `n`-resolvable.\n\n2.  **Translate to Standard Terminology:**\n    *   A functor `f: J -> Vect_K`, where `J` is a poset (an upper semilattice is a type of poset), is more commonly known as a *representation* of the poset `J`.\n    *   The property of being `n`-resolvable means that the object `f` has a projective resolution of length `n`. The question asks for a single `n` that works for *any* such functor, which means we are looking for the *global dimension* of the category of these functors.\n    *   The category of functors `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is equivalent to the category of modules over the *incidence algebra* `KJ` of the poset `J`.\n    *   The condition that `f` is a \"tame functor\" implies that the representation theory of the poset `J` is of *tame type*. This is one of three representation types (finite, tame, wild).\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Homological Property:** The problem is now reduced to finding the global dimension of the incidence algebra `KJ` for a poset `J` of tame representation type.\n\n4.  **Recall Key Theorem:** A fundamental result in the representation theory of algebras states that the incidence algebra `KJ` of *any finite poset J* is a **hereditary algebra**. This is true regardless of whether `J` is of finite, tame, or wild representation type, or whether it's an upper semilattice.\n\n5.  **Use the Definition of Hereditary Algebra:** An algebra `A` is defined as **hereditary** if its global dimension is less than or equal to 1 (i.e., `gl.dim(A) ≤ 1`).\n\n6.  **Connect to the Solution:**\n    *   Since `KJ` is hereditary, its global dimension is at most 1.\n    *   The global dimension is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all possible modules (representations).\n    *   Therefore, any representation `f` has a projective dimension `pd(f) ≤ 1`.\n    *   This means any representation `f` has a projective resolution of length at most 1 (i.e., `0 -> P₁ -> P₀ -> f -> 0`).\n    *   By definition, this means any functor `f` is **1-resolvable**.\n\n7.  **Check for Sharpness:** Can `n` be 0? `n=0` would mean every functor is 0-resolvable, which means every functor is projective. This is not true in general; non-projective representations exist for most posets. Therefore, `n=1` is the smallest integer that works for all cases.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The value is `n=1`. The conditions \"tame\" and \"upper semilattice\" are subsumed by the more general property that the incidence algebra of any finite poset is hereditary.\n\n9.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will use `print` statements to explain this logic step-by-step and then state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_resolvability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem regarding the resolvability of a tame functor.\n\n    The reasoning is as follows:\n\n    1.  The problem concerns a functor f from a poset J (an upper semilattice)\n        to the category of vector spaces, Vect_K. Such a functor is also known\n        as a representation of the poset J.\n\n    2.  A functor f is 'n-resolvable' if it has a projective resolution of\n        length n. The question asks for a value of n that works for any such\n        functor, which corresponds to the global dimension of the category of\n        all such functors.\n\n    3.  The category of functors Fun(J, Vect_K) is equivalent to the category\n        of modules over the incidence algebra KJ of the poset J. Therefore, the\n        problem is to determine the global dimension of the incidence algebra KJ.\n\n    4.  A fundamental theorem in algebra states that for any finite poset J, its\n        incidence algebra KJ is a hereditary algebra. This property holds\n        regardless of whether the poset's representation type is finite, tame, or\n        wild, and also regardless of whether it is an upper semilattice.\n\n    5.  By definition, an algebra A is hereditary if its global dimension is\n        at most 1.\n        \n        gl.dim(KJ) <= 1\n\n    6.  The global dimension is the supremum of the projective dimensions (pd)\n        of all modules. Thus, for any functor/representation f, its projective\n        dimension is less than or equal to 1.\n        \n        pd(f) <= 1\n\n    7.  This implies that every functor f admits a projective resolution of\n        length at most 1. By definition, this means every functor f is\n        1-resolvable.\n\n    8.  Since there generally exist non-projective representations (for which\n        the projective dimension is exactly 1), the value n=1 is the smallest\n        possible integer that works for all cases.\n\n    Therefore, the final equation is:\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 1\n    explanation = solve_resolvability.__doc__\n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"n = {n}\")\n\nsolve_resolvability()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
