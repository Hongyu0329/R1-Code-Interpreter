    Solves the problem regarding the resolvability of a tame functor.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  The problem concerns a functor f from a poset J (an upper semilattice)
        to the category of vector spaces, Vect_K. Such a functor is also known
        as a representation of the poset J.

    2.  A functor f is 'n-resolvable' if it has a projective resolution of
        length n. The question asks for a value of n that works for any such
        functor, which corresponds to the global dimension of the category of
        all such functors.

    3.  The category of functors Fun(J, Vect_K) is equivalent to the category
        of modules over the incidence algebra KJ of the poset J. Therefore, the
        problem is to determine the global dimension of the incidence algebra KJ.

    4.  A fundamental theorem in algebra states that for any finite poset J, its
        incidence algebra KJ is a hereditary algebra. This property holds
        regardless of whether the poset's representation type is finite, tame, or
        wild, and also regardless of whether it is an upper semilattice.

    5.  By definition, an algebra A is hereditary if its global dimension is
        at most 1.
        
        gl.dim(KJ) <= 1

    6.  The global dimension is the supremum of the projective dimensions (pd)
        of all modules. Thus, for any functor/representation f, its projective
        dimension is less than or equal to 1.
        
        pd(f) <= 1

    7.  This implies that every functor f admits a projective resolution of
        length at most 1. By definition, this means every functor f is
        1-resolvable.

    8.  Since there generally exist non-projective representations (for which
        the projective dimension is exactly 1), the value n=1 is the smallest
        possible integer that works for all cases.

    Therefore, the final equation is:
