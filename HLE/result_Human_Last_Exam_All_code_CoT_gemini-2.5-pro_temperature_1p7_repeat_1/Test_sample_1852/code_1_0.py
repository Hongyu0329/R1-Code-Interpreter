    # Step 1: Define symbolic representations for the cardinals.
    # omega_1 is the first uncountable cardinal.
    # omega_2 is the second uncountable cardinal.
    # We are given 2^omega_1 = omega_2.
    
    # Step 2: Determine delta_2, the infimum of X.
    # X is the set of regular cardinal lengths of maximal towers of uncountable subsets of omega_1.
    # delta_2 is equivalent to the tower number t_omega_1.
    # Theorem 1: t_k >= k^+ (for regular uncountable k). For k=omega_1, t_omega_1 >= omega_1^+ = omega_2.
    # Theorem 2: t_k <= 2^k. With 2^omega_1 = omega_2, we get t_omega_1 <= omega_2.
    # Combining these, we find that t_omega_1 must be omega_2.

    # Step 3: Determine delta_1, the supremum of X.
    # The length of any tower (lambda) is at most 2^omega_1, which is omega_2. So, lambda <= omega_2.
    # Since the minimum length of a tower in X is omega_2, we must have lambda >= omega_2.
    # Therefore, the only possible length for a tower in X is omega_2.
    # This means X = {omega_2}.
    delta_1 = "omega_2"

    # Step 4: Calculate the sum using cardinal arithmetic.
    # For any infinite cardinal k, k + k = k.
    # So, omega_2 + omega_2 = omega_2.
    final_sum = "omega_2"

    # Step 5: Print the final equation with all its components.
