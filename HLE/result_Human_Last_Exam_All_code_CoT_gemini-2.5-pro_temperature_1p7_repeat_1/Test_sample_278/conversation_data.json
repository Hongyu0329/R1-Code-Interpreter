    "My plan is to determine the boundary of the figure defined by the parametric curve and then find the smallest square that encloses this boundary.\n\n1.  **Analyze the x-coordinates:** The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)` for `t` in `[0, 2π)`. The range of the cosine function over a full period is `[-1, 1]`. Therefore, the minimum x-value is -1 and the maximum x-value is 1. The width of the figure is `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the y-coordinates:** The y-coordinate depends on the interval of `t`.\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `y = 1 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to 1, so `y` is in `[0, 1]`. The maximum y-value is 1.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `y = 5 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from -1 to 0 (not including 0), so `y = 5 * sin(t)` ranges from -5 to 0. The minimum y-value is -5.\n    *   Combining these two intervals, the total range for `y` is `[-5, 1]`. The height of the figure is `1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n3.  **Find the smallest enclosing square:** The figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can enclose this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger dimension of the rectangle, which is `max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the area:** The area of a square with a side length of 6 is `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Determine the range of x.\n# x = cos(t) for t in [0, 2*pi). The range of cos(t) is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# Step 2: Determine the range of y.\n# For t in [0, pi], y = 1 * sin(t). The range of sin(t) is [0, 1], so y is in [0, 1].\ny_max_upper = 1\n# For t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5 * sin(t). The range of sin(t) is [-1, 0), so y is in [-5, 0).\ny_min_lower = -5\n# The total range for y is from the minimum to the maximum of these values.\ny_min = y_min_lower\ny_max = y_max_upper\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# Step 4: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n# The side length must be the maximum of the width and height.\nside = max(width, height)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side * side\n\n# Step 6: Print the calculation steps and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The height of the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\nprint(f\"The side of the smallest enclosing square is max({width}, {height}) = {side}.\")\nprint(f\"The area of the square is the side length squared.\")\nprint(f\"Area = {side} * {side} = {area}\")\n\n<<<36>>>\n```"
