# Step 1: Determine the range of x.
# x = cos(t) for t in [0, 2*pi). The range of cos(t) is [-1, 1].
x_min = -1
x_max = 1

# Step 2: Determine the range of y.
# For t in [0, pi], y = 1 * sin(t). The range of sin(t) is [0, 1], so y is in [0, 1].
y_max_upper = 1
# For t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5 * sin(t). The range of sin(t) is [-1, 0), so y is in [-5, 0).
y_min_lower = -5
# The total range for y is from the minimum to the maximum of these values.
y_min = y_min_lower
y_max = y_max_upper

# Step 3: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box.
width = x_max - x_min
height = y_max - y_min

# Step 4: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.
# The side length must be the maximum of the width and height.
side = max(width, height)

# Step 5: Calculate the area of the square.
area = side * side

# Step 6: Print the calculation steps and the final answer.
print(f"The width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.")

print(f"The side of the smallest enclosing square is max({width}, {height}) = {side}.")
print(f"The area of the square is the side length squared.")
print(f"Area = {side} * {side} = {area}")
