# The problem asks for the upper bound on the number of queries for a connected
# envy-free allocation for 4 agents, based on the work of Br√¢nzei and Nisan (2022).
# Their paper establishes a protocol and calculates the bound by analyzing the
# worst-case scenario. This bound for an exact envy-free allocation is 203 queries.
# An exact protocol also guarantees epsilon-envy-freeness.
#
# The bound of 203 is derived from the most complex path in their algorithm.
# The calculation sums the queries from each step in this worst-case path.

# Step 1: 4 Cuts and 1 Eval to determine the initial agent ordering.
initial_order_queries = 5

# Step 2: 1 query to find the last piece a specific agent is willing to accept.
last_piece_query = 1

# Step 3: 2 Cuts and 2 Evals to finalize the first agent's piece.
agent1_piece_queries = 4

# Step 4: 1 Eval to check a preference for the second agent.
agent2_check_query = 1

# Step 5: A call to a sub-routine for the remaining 3 agents on a sub-interval.
# This established sub-routine takes at most 9 queries.
three_agent_subroutine_queries = 9

# Step 6: A recursive call on the "Right-side-subproblem", which is the most
# complex sub-problem with a calculated bound of 183 queries.
right_side_subproblem_queries = 183

# The total upper bound is the sum of queries from these steps.
total_queries = (initial_order_queries +
