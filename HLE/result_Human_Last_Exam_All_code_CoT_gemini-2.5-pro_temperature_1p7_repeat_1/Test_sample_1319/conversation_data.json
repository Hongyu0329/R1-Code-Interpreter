    "Here is the plan to identify the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, besides Mount Olympus:\n1.  First, create a list of the major historical mountains mentioned by Homer in the Iliad.\n2.  These mountains are: Mount Olympus, Mount Athos, Mount Ida (in the Troad, now Kaz Dağı in Turkey), Mount Pelion, and the mountain on the island of Samothrace (now called Saos or Fengari).\n3.  Next, find the modern, real-world elevations for each of these mountains.\n4.  Store these mountains and their elevations in a data structure, like a dictionary.\n5.  Remove Mount Olympus from consideration, as per the user's request.\n6.  From the remaining mountains, find the one with the highest elevation.\n7.  Finally, print the name of this mountain and its elevation, showing the numbers that were compared to find the maximum.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their real-world elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        'Mount Olympus': 2918,\n        'Mount Athos': 2033,\n        'Mount Ida': 1774,\n        'Mount Pelion': 1624,\n        'Mount Samothrace': 1611\n    }\n\n    # Exclude Mount Olympus to find the next tallest.\n    other_mountains = {name: elev for name, elev in mountains.items() if name != 'Mount Olympus'}\n\n    # Find the name of the tallest mountain among the rest.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(other_mountains, key=other_mountains.get)\n    \n    # Get the elevation of that mountain.\n    tallest_mountain_elevation = other_mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(\"The historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad (besides Olympus) and their elevations are:\")\n    for name, elevation in other_mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {elevation} meters\")\n\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    # We will show the comparison to find the maximum elevation.\n    elevations_to_compare = list(other_mountains.values())\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe comparison to find the maximum elevation is:\")\n    print(f\"max({elevations_to_compare[0]}, {elevations_to_compare[1]}, {elevations_to_compare[2]}, {elevations_to_compare[3]}) = {tallest_mountain_elevation}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, after Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
