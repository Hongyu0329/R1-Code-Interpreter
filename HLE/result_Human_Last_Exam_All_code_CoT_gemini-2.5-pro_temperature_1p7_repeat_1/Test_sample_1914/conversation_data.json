    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms. My plan is to solve this by breaking down the problem into combinatorial cases.\n\n### My plan\n1.  **Understand the structure**: A category with 2 objects, let's call them A and B, and 4 morphisms has its morphisms partitioned among four sets: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(B,B)`, `Hom(A,B)`, and `Hom(B,A)`.\n2.  **Apply category axioms**:\n    *   **Identity**: Each object must have an identity morphism. So, `id_A` is in `Hom(A,A)` and `id_B` is in `Hom(B,B)`. This means `|Hom(A,A)| >= 1` and `|Hom(B,B)| >= 1`.\n    *   **Composition**: For any morphisms `f: X -> Y` and `g: Y -> Z`, their composition `g . f` must be a morphism in `Hom(X,Z)`. This composition must be associative.\n3.  **Enumerate distributions**: The 4 morphisms must be distributed among the four `Hom` sets. Given that two are identities, we are distributing the remaining 2 \"non-identity\" morphisms. I will enumerate all possible size distributions `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)` that sum to 4.\n4.  **Handle isomorphisms**: Two categories are isomorphic if they are structurally identical. In this case, this can mean swapping the labels of the objects A and B. I will group the distributions that are equivalent under this swapping to avoid overcounting.\n5.  **Count structures for each distribution**: For each unique distribution pattern, I will determine how many ways the composition rules can be defined to form a valid, non-isomorphic category. This involves analyzing the constraints imposed by the axioms on each case. For some cases, this corresponds to counting the number of non-isomorphic monoids of a certain size.\n6.  **Sum the results**: The total number of categories will be the sum of the counts from each unique distribution pattern.\n\nThe python code below implements the final step of this plan, summing up the counts derived from each case, with comments explaining the origin of each number.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n# The calculation is based on a case-by-case analysis of how the 4 morphisms can be distributed.\n\n# A category with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 morphisms requires:\n# - An identity morphism for each object: id_A in Hom(A,A) and id_B in Hom(B,B).\n# - The total number of morphisms |Hom(A,A)| + |Hom(B,B)| + |Hom(A,B)| + |Hom(B,A)| = 4.\n\n# We analyze the problem by considering the non-isomorphic distributions of morphisms.\n# The number of categories is the sum of counts from each distinct structural pattern.\n\n# Pattern 1: Morphism distribution is (3, 1, 0, 0) or (1, 3, 0, 0).\n# In this case, one object has 3 endomorphisms (forming a monoid of order 3),\n# and the other has only the identity.\n# The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is a known result from algebra, which is 5.\n# These 5 monoids define 5 distinct categories.\ncount_pattern1 = 5\n\n# Pattern 2: Distribution is (1, 1, 2, 0) or (1, 1, 0, 2).\n# Here, two morphisms go from one object to another, e.g., f, g: A -> B.\n# There are no non-identity morphisms to compose, so composition rules are trivial.\n# The structure is unique regardless of how we label the morphisms. This gives 1 category.\ncount_pattern2 = 1\n\n# Pattern 3: Distribution is (2, 2, 0, 0).\n# Hom(A,A) and Hom(B,B) both have 2 morphisms, forming two monoids of order 2.\n# There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2. Let's call them M1 and M2.\n# We need to count the number of distinct pairs we can form, up to swapping the objects.\n# The possible pairs of monoids are (M1, M1), (M2, M2), and (M1, M2).\n# The pair (M2, M1) is isomorphic to (M1, M2). So there are 3 possibilities.\ncount_pattern3 = 3\n\n# Pattern 4: Distribution is (2, 1, 1, 0) or (1, 2, 0, 1).\n# One object has a monoid of order 2 (Hom(A,A)), and there's one morphism from A to B (g: A -> B).\n# Let f be the non-identity morphism in Hom(A,A). The composition g . f must equal g.\n# The 2 possible monoid structures for Hom(A,A) each yield a valid and distinct category.\ncount_pattern4 = 2\n\n# Pattern 5: Distribution is (2, 1, 0, 1) or (1, 2, 1, 0).\n# Similar to the above, but the morphism goes from B to A (g: B -> A).\n# The composition f . g must equal g.\n# This structure is not isomorphic to Pattern 4.\n# Again, the 2 monoid structures for Hom(A,A) give 2 distinct categories.\ncount_pattern5 = 2\n\n# Pattern 6: Distribution is (1, 1, 1, 1).\n# One morphism f: A -> B, and one morphism g: B -> A.\n# The composition rules are uniquely determined by the axioms: g . f = id_A and f . g = id_B.\n# This defines a single, rigid category structure where the objects A and B are isomorphic.\ncount_pattern6 = 1\n\n# The total number of non-isomorphic categories is the sum of counts from all patterns.\ntotal_categories = count_pattern1 + count_pattern2 + count_pattern3 + count_pattern4 + count_pattern5 + count_pattern6\n\n# The final equation shows the contribution from each distinct structural pattern.\nprint(f\"The total number of non-isomorphic categories is the sum of counts from each pattern:\")\nprint(f\"{count_pattern1} + {count_pattern2} + {count_pattern3} + {count_pattern4} + {count_pattern5} + {count_pattern6} = {total_categories}\")\n\n```\n<<<14>>>"
