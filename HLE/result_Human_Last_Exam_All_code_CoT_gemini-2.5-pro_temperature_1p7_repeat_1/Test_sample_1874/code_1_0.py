Step 1: Understanding the definition of the tower.
The problem describes a sequence of sets <x_alpha : alpha in delta> where:
1. Each x_alpha is a subset of omega_2 of size omega_2.
2. For alpha < beta < delta, we have |x_beta \\ x_alpha| < omega_2. In the language of set theory, this is written as x_beta subseteq^* x_alpha. This means the sequence is a "decreasing tower" modulo sets of size less than omega_2.
3. The tower is maximal: there is no single subset y of omega_2 of size omega_2 that is "almost" a subset of all sets in the tower. That is, there is no y such that for all alpha < delta, y subseteq^* x_alpha.

Step 2: Identifying the relevant cardinal characteristic.
The smallest cardinal delta for which such a maximal tower exists is a well-known cardinal characteristic called the "tower number", generalized to the cardinal omega_2. It is denoted by t(omega_2). The question asks for the second smallest possible value this cardinal t(omega_2) can take.

Step 3: Stating the properties of t(omega_2).
Within ZFC set theory, we can prove certain properties about t(kappa) for any regular cardinal kappa. For kappa = omega_2:
a) t(omega_2) > omega_2. This can be proven by a diagonalization argument showing that any tower of length omega_2 is not maximal. Since t(omega_2) is a cardinal, this implies t(omega_2) >= omega_3.
b) The cofinality of t(omega_2) must be greater than omega_2. That is, cf(t(omega_2)) > omega_2. This is proven by showing that if cf(t(omega_2)) <= omega_2, one could find a pseudo-intersection for the tower, contradicting its maximality.

Step 4: Determining the smallest possible value for delta.
We are looking for the smallest cardinal delta that satisfies:
- delta >= omega_3
- cf(delta) > omega_2

The first cardinal to check is omega_3.
- omega_3 >= omega_3 (True)
- cf(omega_3) = omega_3, and omega_3 > omega_2 (True)
So, omega_3 is a candidate for the smallest value. It is known to be consistent with ZFC that t(omega_2) = omega_3. For instance, in a model of set theory where 2^(omega_2) = omega_3, it must be that t(omega_2) = omega_3, since omega_3 <= t(omega_2) <= 2^(omega_2).
Thus, the smallest possible value for delta is omega_3.

Step 5: Determining the second smallest possible value for delta.
We now look for the next cardinal after omega_3 that satisfies the required properties.
The next cardinal after omega_3 is omega_4. Let's check the properties for delta = omega_4:
- omega_4 >= omega_3 (True)
- cf(omega_4) = omega_4, and omega_4 > omega_2 (True)
So, omega_4 is a candidate. For it to be a possible value, it must be consistent with ZFC that t(omega_2) = omega_4. Set theorists have constructed models of ZFC where this is true. For example, in a model obtained by adding omega_4 random reals to a universe where the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis holds, it is the case that t(omega_2) = omega_4.

Conclusion:
The smallest possible value for delta is omega_3. The second smallest possible value is the next cardinal that fits the criteria, which is omega_4.
