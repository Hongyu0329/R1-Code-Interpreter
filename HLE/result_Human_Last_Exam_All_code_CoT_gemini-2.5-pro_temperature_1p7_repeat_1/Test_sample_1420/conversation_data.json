    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat using the epsilon expansion, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical model and theory**: The problem concerns critical phenomena, and the standard framework is the O(N) vector model analyzed via the Renormalization Group. The epsilon expansion is a key technique within this framework.\n2.  **Define the epsilon parameter (ϵ)**: The expansion is performed near the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For the O(N) model, `d_c = 4`. The parameter `ϵ` is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`. Given the spatial dimension `d=3`, we find `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3.  **State the formula for the exponent α**: The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent `α` is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * ϵ`\n    where `N` is the number of components of the order parameter.\n4.  **Specify N**: Since `N` is not given, we will use the value for the simplest and most common model in this context, the Ising model, for which `N=1`.\n5.  **Calculate α**: We will substitute `N=1` and `ϵ=1` into the formula to compute the value of the exponent.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan, showing the formula and the substitution of each numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat exponent alpha using the first-order epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the calculation\n    d = 3      # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4    # Upper critical dimension for the O(N) model\n    N = 1      # Number of order parameter components (Ising model)\n\n    # Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Calculate alpha using the first-order expansion formula\n    numerator = 4 - N\n    denominator = 2 * (N + 8)\n    alpha = float(numerator) / float(denominator) * epsilon\n\n    # Print the explanation and the steps of the calculation\n    print(\"Calculation of the specific heat exponent 'alpha' using the first-order epsilon expansion.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: alpha = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * epsilon\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Given values:\")\n    print(f\"Spatial dimension, d = {d}\")\n    print(f\"Upper critical dimension, d_c = {d_c}\")\n    print(f\"Number of components (Ising model), N = {N}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate epsilon\")\n    print(f\"epsilon = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Step 2: Substitute values into the formula for alpha\")\n    # Show the final equation with all numbers substituted as requested\n    print(f\"alpha = ({4} - {N}) / ({2} * ({N} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"alpha = {numerator} / ({2} * {N+8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"alpha = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"The resulting value for the specific heat exponent alpha is: {alpha}\")\n\n\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
