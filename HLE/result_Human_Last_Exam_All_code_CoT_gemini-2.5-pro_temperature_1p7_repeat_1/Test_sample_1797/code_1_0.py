    This function identifies the incorrect statement about attack graph analysis.
    Based on the analysis:
    A is correct.
    B is correct.
    C is incorrect because attack graph generation is generally polynomial in input size,
      though the output graph can be exponential. NP-hardness typically applies to the
      analysis of the graph (e.g., finding optimal countermeasures), not its generation.
    D is correct.
