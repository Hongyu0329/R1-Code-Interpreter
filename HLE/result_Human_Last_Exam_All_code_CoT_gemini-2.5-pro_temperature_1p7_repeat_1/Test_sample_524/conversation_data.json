    "This is a classic problem in point-set topology. The solution is not derived from a simple computation but from a significant mathematical theorem by R.H. Bing. The theorem states that any homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of just three specific spaces.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that:\n1.  Defines a list containing the names of these three distinct homeomorphism classes.\n2.  Prints the name of each class.\n3.  Calculates the total number of classes by counting the items in the list.\n4.  Displays the result as an equation, summing up the count for each class to get the total, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_homogeneous_planar_continua():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of counting the homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n    \n    This is a known result from a theorem by R.H.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
