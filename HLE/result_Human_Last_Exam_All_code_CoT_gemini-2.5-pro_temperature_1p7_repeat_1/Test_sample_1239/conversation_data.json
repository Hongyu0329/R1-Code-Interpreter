    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Problem:** The task is to find a specific number: the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This is a known result from the field of mathematical physics and the theory of differential equations. It cannot be derived from scratch by a simple script, but a script can be used to present the calculation based on the established theory.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Symmetries:** The total symmetry group is composed of several types of transformations that leave the equations invariant. I will list these individual symmetry types. The dimension of the full group is the sum of the number of independent transformations (generators) of each type.\n\n3.  **List the Symmetry Components:** The finite-dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations is generated by transformations for:\n    *   Time translation (shifting time forwards or backwards).\n    *   Spatial translations (shifting space in any of the 3 dimensions).\n    *   Spatial rotations (rotating the coordinate system around any of the 3 axes).\n    *   Galilean boosts (transforming to a constantly moving reference frame).\n    *   Scaling transformations (dilating or contracting space, time, and the physical fields).\n    *   Pressure shifts (adding a constant to the pressure field).\n\n4.  **Sum the Dimensions:** I will write a Python script that assigns the number of generators for each symmetry type to a variable. The script will then sum these numbers and print out the complete calculation and the final result, thus satisfying the user's request for a coded solution.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of\n    symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    The dimension is the sum of the number of generators for each type of\n    symmetry transformation that leaves the equations invariant.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3 are:\n    # ∂u/∂t + (u ⋅ ∇)u = -∇p + ν∇²u\n    # ∇ ⋅ u = 0\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is calculated by summing the number of independent generators for each type of symmetry.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # 1.
