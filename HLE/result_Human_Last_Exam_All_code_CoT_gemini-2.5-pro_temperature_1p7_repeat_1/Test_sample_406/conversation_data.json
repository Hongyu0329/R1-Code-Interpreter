    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a breakdown of the conditions for a tripled fixed point, followed by a Python script that demonstrates these concepts by finding such a point for a specific set of functions.\n\n### **Thinking Steps and Plan**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The user is asking for the conditions under which three functions, `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z`, have a \"tripled fixed point\". I will assume the second function labeled `G` (`G:Z*Y*X→Z`) is a typo and should be `H`.\n\n2.  **Define a Tripled Fixed Point:** A point `(x, y, z)` in the combined space `X×Y×Z` is a tripled fixed point if it simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    *   `x = F(x, y, z)`\n    *   `y = G(y, x, y)`\n    *   `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Conditions:** For a general solution to exist, we typically rely on principles from fixed-point theory. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are usually generalizations of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. In simple terms, these conditions are:\n    *   **Space Condition:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces. This is a technical requirement that, for practical purposes (like the set of real numbers), means the spaces have no \"holes\" and that sequences that should converge actually do have a limit within the space.\n    *   **Function Condition:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must be \"contractive\" when considered together. This means that if you take two different input triplets, the resulting output triplets are closer to each other than the original ones were. More formally, we can define a single operator `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`. If this combined operator `T` is a contraction mapping on the product space `X×Y×Z`, then a unique tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.\n\n4.  **Create a Python Demonstration:**\n    *   I will write a Python script that works with real numbers (where `X = Y = Z = R`, the set of real numbers, which is a complete metric space).\n    *   I will define three simple linear functions for `F`, `G`, and `H` that satisfy the contraction property.\n    *   The script will use an iterative method called \"successive approximations\". It starts with an initial guess (e.g., `(0, 0, 0)`) and repeatedly applies the functions to get closer and closer to the true fixed point.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the converged fixed point `(x, y, z)` and verify that it satisfies the three initial equations, showing all the numbers involved.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef F(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sample function F: R*R*R -> R.\n    This function is part of a system that satisfies contraction conditions.\n    The equation is: F(x, y, z) = 0.1*x + 0.2*y - 0.1*z + 1.0\n    \"\"\"\n    return 0.1*x + 0.2*y - 0.1*z + 1.0\n\ndef G(y1, x, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sample function G: R*R*R -> R.\n    The fixed point condition is y = G(y, x, y).\n    The equation is: G(y1, x, y2) = 0.1*y1 + 0.1*y2 + 0.3*x + 2.0.\n    So, G(y, x, y) = 0.2*y + 0.3*x + 2.0\n    \"\"\"\n    return 0.1*y1 + 0.1*y2 + 0.3*x + 2.0\n\ndef H(z, y, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sample function H: R*R*R -> R.\n    This function is part of a system that satisfies contraction conditions.\n    The equation is: H(z, y, x) = 0.1*z - 0.2*y + 0.3*x + 3.0\n    \"\"\"\n    return 0.1*z - 0.2*y + 0.3*x + 3.0\n\ndef find_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the FGH-tripled fixed point using the method of successive approximations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial guess for the fixed point (x, y, z)\n    x, y, z = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\n\n    # Number of iterations for convergence\n    # For a contraction mapping, this iterative process is guaranteed to converge.\n    num_iterations = 100\n\n    for i in range(num_iterations):\n        # Store the current values to use in this iteration's calculations\n        x_prev, y_prev, z_prev = x, y, z\n        \n        # Calculate the next approximation for (x, y, z)\n        x = F(x_prev, y_prev, z_prev)\n        y = G(y_prev, x_prev, y_prev)\n        z = H(z_prev, y_prev, x_prev)\n    \n    print(\"Found the tripled fixed point (x, y, z) after {} iterations:\".format(num_iterations))\n    print(f\"({x:.4f}, {y:.4f}, {z:.4f})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"Verifying the fixed point by substituting the values back into the equations:\")\n    \n    # Equation 1: x = F(x, y, z)\n    print(\"\\n1.
