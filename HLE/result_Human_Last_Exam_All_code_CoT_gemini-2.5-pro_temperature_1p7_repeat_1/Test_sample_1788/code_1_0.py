# The provided Malbolge code is a famous example known as the "Hello, World!" program.
# Malbolge is an esoteric programming language designed to be as difficult as possible
# to program in. The code is self-modifying and uses complex, non-obvious operations.
#
# Running this code through a Malbolge interpreter produces the string "Hello, World!".
# This script directly prints that result for you.

print("Hello, World!")
