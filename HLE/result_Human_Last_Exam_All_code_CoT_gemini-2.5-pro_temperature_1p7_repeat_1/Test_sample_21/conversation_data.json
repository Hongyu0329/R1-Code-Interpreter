    "Of course, I can help with that. This problem involves advanced concepts from algebraic number theory, namely Chebotarev's density theorem. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Connect to Theory**: First, I'll explain that the natural density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of its Galois group, $G$. According to Chebotarev's density theorem, this density equals the proportion of elements in $G$ that act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. For a degree 7 polynomial like this one, this means we need to find the proportion of 7-cycles in its Galois group.\n2.  **Find the Galois Group**: The crucial step is to identify the Galois group of $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. This is a non-trivial computation. This specific polynomial is a known example whose Galois group is the dihedral group $D_7$, the group of symmetries of a regular heptagon, which has order 14. I will use a Python library called `cypari2` that interfaces with the powerful PARI/GP computer algebra system to verify this.\n3.  **Analyze the Group Structure**: Once the group is confirmed to be $D_7$, I will analyze its elements. The group $D_7$ contains 6 elements that are 7-cycles (the rotations of the heptagon) and 7 elements that are reflections, plus the identity.\n4.  **Calculate the Density**: The required density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group. This will be $6 / 14$.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will provide a Python script that carries out these steps, prints the reasoning, and shows the final calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_polynomial_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n\n    This function uses Chebotarev's density theorem, which relates this density\n    to the structure of the polynomial's Galois group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # For the given polynomial to be irreducible modulo a prime p, the\n    # Frobenius element at p must act as a single cycle on the 7 roots.\n    # This means we need to count the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group.\n\n    # We use the cypari2 library to determine the Galois group.\n    # This library is a Python interface to the PARI/GP computer algebra system.\n    # If you don't have it, you can install it via `pip install cypari2`.\n    try:\n        import cypari2\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Error: The 'cypari2' library is required to run this code.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        print(\"Please install it using: pip install cypari2\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    pari = cypari2.Pari()\n    \n    # Define the polynomial in PARI/GP syntax\n    f_poly = pari('x^7 - 14*x^5 + 56*x^3 - 56*x + 22')\n\n    # Compute the Galois group information.
