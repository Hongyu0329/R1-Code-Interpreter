    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### **Step-by-step Derivations**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to determine the presence of rings or pi bonds.\n    *   DBE = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2 = (2*7 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\n    *   A DBE of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   **Signal Count:** The formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 distinct NMR signals. This means two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, leading to one overlapping signal.\n    *   **Signal Analysis:**\n        *   **145 ppm (s):** A chemical shift greater than 100 ppm indicates a carbon in a double bond (C=C). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) means this carbon has no directly attached hydrogen atoms, so it's a quaternary carbon (`>C=`).\n        *   **112 ppm (t):** This shift also indicates a carbon in a double bond. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) means it's bonded to two hydrogen atoms (`=CH₂`).\n        *   From these two signals, we can identify a `>C=CH₂` fragment. This confirms the presence of a double bond.\n        *   **48 ppm (t):** This is a saturated (sp³) carbon. The triplet multiplicity indicates a `-CH₂-` (methylene) group.\n        *   **27 ppm (d):** This is a saturated (sp³) carbon. The doublet multiplicity indicates a `-CH-` (methine) group.\n        *   **22 ppm (q) and 21 ppm (q):** These are saturated (sp³) carbons. The quartet multiplicity ('q') indicates `-CH₃` (methyl) groups. We have two non-equivalent methyl environments.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a central `>C=CH₂` fragment. The remaining part of the molecule, C₅H₁₂, must be attached as two separate alkyl groups to the quaternary carbon (`>C=`).\n    *   Let's look at the available sp³ fragments: one `-CH₂-` (48t), one `-CH-` (27d), and at least two `-CH₃` groups (22q, 21q).\n    *   Summing the carbons in these fragments gives `CH₂ + CH + CH₃ + CH₃ = C₄H₉`. The remainder of the molecule is C₅H₁₂, so we are missing one `CH₃` group.\n    *   This confirms our initial deduction that two carbons are equivalent. The missing `CH₃` group must be equivalent to one of the other methyl groups. Therefore, one of the quartet signals (likely the one at 21 ppm) represents two identical methyl groups.\n    *   To accommodate two equivalent methyl groups, they are most likely attached to the same carbon. Combining the `-CH-` fragment with two `-CH₃` fragments gives an **isopropyl group** (`-CH(CH₃)₂`).\n    *   The remaining fragments are one `-CH₂-` and one `-CH₃`, which form an **ethyl group** (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   Now, we attach the two derived alkyl groups (ethyl and isopropyl) to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH₃CH₂)-C(=CH₂)-(CH(CH₃)₂)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The final step is to name the structure according to IUPAC nomenclature. We find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   Numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond, making the `=CH₂` carbon C1.\n    *   The longest chain is a 4-carbon chain (but-1-ene).\n    *   There is an ethyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C3.\n    *   Putting it together and alphabetizing the substituents, the name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula and all signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\n# The final IUPAC name of the compound is derived from the step-by-step analysis of its molecular formula and 13C NMR spectrum.\n# Molecular Formula: C7H14\n# 13C NMR signals: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\n# The analysis leads to the structure of 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene.\n\n# The final IUPAC name includes numbers to indicate the positions of the substituents and the double bond.\n# The following code prints this name.\n\nfinal_iupac_name = \"2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene\"\nprint(final_iupac_name)\n```\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
