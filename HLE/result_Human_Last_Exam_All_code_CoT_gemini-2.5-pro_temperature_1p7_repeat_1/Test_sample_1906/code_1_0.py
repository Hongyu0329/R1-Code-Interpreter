    print("5. Since 1 is terminal, 1 x Z is isomorphic to Z. This gives us:")
    print("   Hom(Z, Y) ~= Hom(1, Y^Z)")
    print("6. Also, since 1 is terminal, Hom(1, A) is a singleton set for any object A.")
    print("7. Therefore, Hom(Z, Y) must be a singleton set for all Z and Y.")
    print("8. From (1), we know Hom(Z, Y) is an abelian group. The only singleton group is the trivial group {0}.")
