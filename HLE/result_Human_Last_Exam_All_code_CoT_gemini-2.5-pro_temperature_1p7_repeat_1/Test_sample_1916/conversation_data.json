    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the structure:** A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid.\n2.  **Define the monoid:** We have one object, so all three morphisms are endomorphisms (they map the object to itself). Let the set of morphisms be `M = {id, f, g}`. By convention, one of these must be the identity morphism, `id`. The composition of any two morphisms must also be in `M`. This structure defines a monoid of order 3.\n3.  **Find all monoids:** A monoid operation is defined by its multiplication table. For `M = {id, f, g}`, the `id` element's behavior is fixed (`id` composed with any morphism `m` is `m`). This means we only need to define the four products involving the non-identity elements: `f∘f`, `f∘g`, `g∘f`, and `g∘g`. Each of these four products can be `id`, `f`, or `g`, leading to `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables.\n4.  **Check for associativity:** Not all of these 81 tables will be associative. We must filter out the ones that do not satisfy the associative law: `(a∘b)∘c = a∘(b∘c)` for all `a, b, c` in `M`.\n5.  **Count non-isomorphic classes:** After finding all valid monoids (associative tables), we must group them into isomorphism classes. Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling the non-identity elements. In our case, this means checking if swapping the roles of `f` and `g` results in another valid monoid we have found. We will count the number of unique classes.\n6.  **Implementation:** A Python script can systematically perform this search:\n    *   Iterate through all 81 possibilities for the `(f∘f, f∘g, g∘f, g∘g)` products.\n    *   For each, check for associativity.\n    *   For each valid monoid, determine its \"canonical form\" (the lexicographically smallest representation between itself and the version with `f` and `g` swapped) to uniquely identify its isomorphism class.\n    *   Count the number of unique canonical forms.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the number of non-isomorphic categories with 1 object and 3 morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We represent the morphisms {id, f, g} as the integers {0, 1, 2}.\n    # The identity laws (x*id = id*x = x) are pre-defined.
