    This function prints a step-by-step logical analysis of the population

    print("Analyzing the given statements based on the provided population genetics scenario:\n")

    # --- Statement 1 Analysis ---
    print("--- Analysis of Statement 1: There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured. ---")
    print("The problem explicitly states:")
    print("  a) 'all genotypes have equal fitness'")
    print("  b) The phenotype has 'no bearing on fitness.'")
    print("Selection is defined as differential fitness among individuals. Since all genotypes have equal fitness, there is no selection by definition.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 1 MUST be true.\n")

    # --- Statement 2 Analysis ---
    print("--- Analysis of Statement 2: Parents will not raise their offspring. ---")
    print("The problem states that the population has 'discrete and non-overlapping generations.'")
    print("This is a modeling assumption meaning that individuals from the parent generation are not in the reproductive pool at the same time as individuals from the offspring generation.")
    print("This does not logically forbid parental care. For example, parents could care for their young and then die before the young become sexually mature.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 2 is NOT NECESSARILY true.\n")

    # --- Statement 3 Analysis ---
    print("--- Analysis of Statement 3: The population will never speciate even in future generations. ---")
    print("Speciation is an evolutionary process that results in the formation of new species. This requires evolutionary change.")
    print("The population is described with conditions that prevent evolution:")
    print("  - No selection")
    print("  - No mutation")
    print("  - No gene flow")
    print("  - Infinitely large (no genetic drift)")
    print("With no mechanisms for evolution present, the population cannot evolve, and therefore cannot speciate, assuming these conditions persist.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 3 MUST be true.\n")

    # --- Statement 4 Analysis ---
    print("--- Analysis of Statement 4: The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals. ---")
    print("Phenotype is determined by Genotype and Environment (P = G + E).")
    print("Because of 'random mating' throughout the entire region, the genetic makeup (G) will be homogenous. The average genotype will be the same in the west and east.")
    print("However, the broad-sense heritability (H^2) is 0.7, which is less than 1. This means that 30% of the phenotypic variation is due to environmental factors (E).")
    print("The problem does not state that the environment is uniform across the region. A systematic environmental difference could exist between the west and east, causing a difference in the average phenotype.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 4 is NOT NECESSARILY true.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("--- Summary ---")
    print("Statements that must always be true: 1 and 3.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice F.")
