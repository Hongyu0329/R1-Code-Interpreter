    This function identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing proposition on the same ballot.

    Based on the San Francisco Department of Elections Voter Information Pamphlet,
    Propositions C, N, and O all seek to amend the city's Real Property Transfer Tax.
    They contain conflicting measure clauses, meaning if more than one passes,
    the one with the most "yes" votes is enacted, and the others are nullified.
    Therefore, C, N, and O are all potentially nullifiable.
