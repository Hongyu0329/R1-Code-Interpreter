    """
    Analyzes a list of champions to see if they can perform a hook-flash,
    which is hooking in one direction and flashing in the opposite direction
    to increase the hook's range.

    The champions and their hook mechanics are as follows:
    - Blitzcrank: No. His hook is a projectile whose path is fixed on cast.
    - Nautilus: No. His hook is a projectile whose path is fixed on cast.
    - Pyke: No. His hook is a projectile whose path is fixed on cast.
    - Thresh: Yes. His hook's origin is determined at the end of the cast animation,
              allowing a flash during the wind-up to extend its effective range.
