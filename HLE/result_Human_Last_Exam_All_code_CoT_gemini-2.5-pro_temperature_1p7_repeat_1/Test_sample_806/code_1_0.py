    explanation = """
The clinical scenario described, where a patient develops skin blisters after being prescribed a new medication for seizures, is highly indicative of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

The specific biochemical reaction that initiates the widespread skin cell death resulting in blisters is:

The release of the cytotoxic protein Granulysin by activated immune cells (specifically Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes and Natural Killer cells).

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. Immune Activation: The anticonvulsant drug (or its metabolite) is recognized as a foreign substance by the patient's immune system, leading to the activation of T-cells and NK cells.

2. Targeting Skin Cells: These activated immune cells migrate to the skin and recognize the body's own skin cells (keratinocytes) as targets.

3. Release of Granulysin: The activated T-cells and NK cells release granulysin. Granulysin is a powerful protein that perforates the cell membrane of keratinocytes.

4. Cell Death and Blistering: The damage caused by granulysin triggers widespread programmed cell death (apoptosis) of keratinocytes. This massive cell death causes the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) to detach from the underlying dermis, leading to the formation of the characteristic painful blisters and skin sloughing seen in SJS/TEN.
