    "To evaluate the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Integrand**: The integrand is a summation of logarithms. We can use the property $\\sum \\log a_n = \\log (\\prod a_n)$ to convert the sum into a product:\n    $$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Use the Infinite Product Identity**: There is a well-known infinite product identity for the cosine function, which is related to the double-angle formula for sine. The identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\cos\\frac{x}{2} \\cdot \\cos\\frac{x}{4} \\cdot \\cos\\frac{x}{8} \\cdots = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\n\n3.  **Rewrite the Integral**: By substituting this identity into our integrand, the expression for the sum simplifies to $\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)$. The integral becomes:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\n    This step assumes that we can interchange the order of summation and integration. While a rigorous justification is complex and involves advanced techniques, this formal step is standard in the context of such problems.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: The resulting integral is a known definite integral, often referred to as Lobachevsky's integral. Its value is a standard result in mathematical analysis:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n\nTherefore, the value of the original integral is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The following Python code outlines these steps and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the integral by symbolic manipulation and using known mathematical identities.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The problem is to evaluate the integral I = integral from 0 to infinity of sum from n=1 to infinity of log(cos(x/2^n)) dx.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Rewrite the sum inside the integral.\n    # The sum of logarithms is the logarithm of the product of their arguments.\n    print(\"Step 1: The integrand is a sum of logarithms, which can be expressed as the logarithm of an infinite product:\")\n    print(\"  sum_{n=1 to inf} log(cos(x/2^n)) = log( product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) )\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Use the known identity for the infinite product of cosines.\n    print(\"Step 2: The infinite product has a famous closed-form identity:\")\n    print(\"  product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) = sin(x) / x\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Substitute the result back into the integrand.\n    print(\"Step 3: Substituting the product identity into the expression for the sum gives:\")\n    print(\"  Integrand = log(sin(x) / x)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Rewrite the integral.\n    # This step assumes that the interchange of summation and integration is permissible.\n    print(\"Step 4: The original integral transforms into:\")\n    print(\"  I = integral_{0 to inf} log(sin(x)/x) dx\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 5: State the value of the known definite integral.\n    # This integral is a standard result known as Lobachevsky's integral.\n    print(\"Step 5: The value of this definite integral is a well-known mathematical result:\")\n    final_value = -math.pi / 2\n    numerator = \"-pi\"\n    denominator = 2\n    print(f\"  integral_{{0 to inf}} log(sin(x)/x) dx = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Final Answer\n    print(\"Therefore, the value of the integral is:\")\n    print(f\"{numerator} / {denominator} = {final_value}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_integral()\n```\n<<<-1.5707963267948966>>>"
