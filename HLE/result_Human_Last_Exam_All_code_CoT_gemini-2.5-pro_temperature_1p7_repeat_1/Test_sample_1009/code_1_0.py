# Based on the properties of topological groups, the weight of any such group G can be determined.
# The argument proceeds as follows:
# 1. The quotient group H = G/N (where N is the closure of the identity) is a compact,
#    first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.
# 2. Such a group H must be metrizable, and consequently has a countable weight, aleph_0.
# 3. The weight of G is the same as the weight of H.
# 4. Therefore, w(G) = aleph_0 for any group G with the given properties.

# The only possible value for the weight is aleph_0, which is therefore the largest possible weight.
# We represent this cardinal number as a string.
aleph_0 = "aleph_0"

print("The largest possible weight of the group is:")
