    Solves the problem of finding the probability Pm for a given integer m.

    The problem asks for the probability that a random choice of two terms from
    an arithmetic sequence of length 4m+2 results in an (i,j)-divisible sequence.

    This can be reduced to a combinatorial problem on the indices {1, 2, ..., 4m+2}.
