    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set, we first need to understand the notation and how it applies to different atoms. The total count depends on the specific atoms in the molecule.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G\\*\\*)**:\n    *   `6-311G`: This is a \"Pople-style\" split-valence basis set.\n        *   `6-`: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function composed of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   `-311`: Each valence atomic orbital is represented by three functions. The first is a contraction of **3** primitives, while the next two are single, uncontracted primitives (**1** primitive each).\n    *   `**`: This indicates the addition of polarization functions.\n        *   The first `*` adds a single set of d-type polarization functions to each \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atom. This is built from **1** primitive Gaussian.\n        *   The second `*` adds a single set of p-type polarization functions to each hydrogen atom. This is also built from **1** primitive Gaussian.\n\n2.  **Calculate Primitives per Atom Type**:\n    *   **For a Hydrogen atom (H)**:\n        *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n        *   Valence (s-shell) from `-311G`: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitives.\n        *   Polarization (p-shell) from the second `*`: **1** primitive.\n        *   **Total for H = 5 + 1 = 6 primitives.**\n    *   **For a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen)**:\n        *   Core (1s shell) from `6-`: **6** primitives.\n        *   Valence (2s and 2p shells) from `-311G`: Primitives for s and p shells share exponents. The count is 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitives.\n        *   Polarization (d-shell) from the first `*`: **1** primitive.\n        *   **Total for a heavy atom = 6 + 5 + 1 = 12 primitives.**\n\n3.  **Calculate for a Molecule**:\n    The total number of primitives for a molecule is the sum of the primitives for each of its atoms. I will provide a Python script to calculate this for a sample molecule, Methane (CHâ‚„), which contains 1 Carbon (a heavy atom) and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n\n```python\n# A script to calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule\n# using the 6-311G** basis set.\n\n# Step 1: Define the number of primitive Gaussians for each atom type\n# based on the 6-311G** definition.\nprimitives_h = 6  # For Hydrogen\nprimitives_heavy = 12 # For heavy atoms (e.g., C, N, O)\n\n# Step 2: Define the chemical formula of the molecule.\n# We will use Methane (CH4) as an example.\n# A Methane molecule has 1 Carbon atom and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\nnum_carbon = 1\nnum_hydrogen = 4\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the contribution from each type of atom.\ntotal_primitives_c = num_carbon * primitives_heavy\ntotal_primitives_h = num_hydrogen * primitives_h\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total number of primitives for the molecule.\ntotal_primitives = total_primitives_c + total_primitives_h\n\n# Step 5: Print the breakdown and the final result.\nprint(\"Calculation for the 6-311G** basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Primitives per Hydrogen atom: {primitives_h}\")\nprint(f\"Primitives per heavy atom (like Carbon): {primitives_heavy}\")\nprint(\"\\nFor a Methane (CH4) molecule:\")\nprint(f\"The total number of primitive Gaussians is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon} * {primitives_heavy}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {primitives_h}) = {total_primitives}\")\n```\n<<<36>>>"
