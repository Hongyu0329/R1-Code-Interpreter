# Plan:
# 1. Define the time costs for each option based on the problem description.
# 2. Calculate the total time for each option.
# 3. Print the breakdown of the calculation for each option.
# 4. Compare the valid options to find the 'easiest' (least total time).

# Option A: EfficientNet with 5 species
hours_A_train = 36
hours_A_deploy = 13.8
total_A = hours_A_train + hours_A_deploy

# Option B: EfficientNet with 500 species
hours_B_train = 126
hours_B_deploy = 13.8
total_B = hours_B_train + hours_B_deploy

# Option C: ResNet with 500 species
hours_C_train = 128
hours_C_deploy = 11.8
total_C = hours_C_train + hours_C_deploy

# Option D: Manual collection
total_D = 410

# Option F: Using both B and C
total_F = total_B + total_C
