Step-by-step analysis of the statements:

A. Correct. The argument that Augustine's views on predestination are a precursor to Calvinism is a long-standing and significant debate in theology and history.

B. Incorrect. This statement misrepresents the work of the historian R. A. Markus. As a serious scholar of Augustine, Markus engages deeply with his subject's entire theological framework. While he may have focused on specific aspects like Augustine's view of the 'saeculum' (the secular age), it is inaccurate to claim he would "ignore" foundational doctrines like predestination and grace. Scholarly work involves interpretation and focus, not outright omission of central concepts.

C. Correct. Augustine's concept of the 'voluntas' (will) as a faculty of the human soul or psyche is a core part of his philosophy, particularly in works like 'On Free Choice of the Will' ('De libero arbitrio'). The influence of Stoic philosophers like Seneca is also recognized by scholars.

D. Correct. This is a standard and accurate characterization of Augustine's thought. He did not draw a sharp line between philosophy and theology as later thinkers would. For him, they are inextricably linked in the pursuit of divine truth.

E. Correct. Ã‰tienne Gilson was a prominent 20th-century scholar of medieval philosophy. It is an accurate description of his work to say that he would differentiate Augustine's specific theological position on grace from the later, more extreme formulation of the Jansenists, even while acknowledging similarities.

F. Correct. This accurately summarizes a central argument from Augustine's dialogue with Evodius in 'On Free Choice of the Will,' where the responsibility for evil is placed on the misuse of free will by humans, not on God.

The analysis identifies statement B as the incorrect one.
