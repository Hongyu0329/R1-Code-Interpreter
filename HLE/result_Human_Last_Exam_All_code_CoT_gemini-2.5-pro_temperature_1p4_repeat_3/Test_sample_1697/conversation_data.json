    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the chemical reaction followed by a Python script to present the answer.\n\n### Plan and Chemical Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents**: The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. It reacts sequentially with sec-BuLi/TMEDA and then with methyl iodide.\n2.  **Analyze the First Step (Metalation)**:\n    *   `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) is a very strong organolithium base.\n    *   `TMEDA` (tetramethylethylenediamine) is a ligand that chelates the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of sec-BuLi.\n    *   This combination is classic for a reaction called **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. Certain functional groups on a benzene ring, known as Directed Metalating Groups (DMGs), direct the strong base to remove a proton from the adjacent (*ortho*) position.\n    *   The starting material has two powerful DMGs: the N,N-diethylamide group (`-C(=O)N(Et)₂`) at position C1 and the dimethylamino group (`-N(Me)₂`) at position C3.\n    *   The diethylamide group directs metalation to positions C2 and C6. The dimethylamino group directs metalation to positions C2 and C4.\n    *   The C2 position is *ortho* to both directing groups. This synergistic effect makes the hydrogen atom at C2 significantly more acidic than any other on the ring.\n    *   Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C2 position, forming a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n3.  **Analyze the Second Step (Alkylation)**:\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   `Methyl iodide` (CH₃I) is an electrophile.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon at C2 will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion.\n4.  **Determine the Final Product**:\n    *   The reaction results in the substitution of the hydrogen atom at C2 with a methyl group.\n    *   The final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Its molecular formula is C₁₄H₂₂N₂O.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name and molecular formula of this product.\n\n```python\ndef get_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the product of the specified chemical reaction.\n    \n    The reaction is a Directed ortho-Metalation followed by electrophilic quenching.\n    1. N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide has two directing groups (-CONEt2 and -NMe2).\n    2. Both groups direct the base (sec-BuLi) to the C2 position.\n    3. The resulting aryllithium is quenched with the electrophile (methyl iodide).\n    4. A methyl group is added at the C2 position.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the name of the final product based on the chemical analysis\n    product_name = \"N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    \n    # Define the molecular formula of the product\n    # Starting Material: C13H20N2O\n    # Reagents add a methyl group (CH3) and remove a hydrogen (H).
