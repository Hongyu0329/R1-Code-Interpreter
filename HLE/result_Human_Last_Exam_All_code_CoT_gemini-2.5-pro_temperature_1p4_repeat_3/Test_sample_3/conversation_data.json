    "To solve this problem, we need to know the possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is a known result in the theory of elliptic curves. A finite abelian group, such as the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, is non-cyclic if and only if it is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m > 1$ and $m | n$.\n\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields is a deep result. For the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the order of each of these possible groups and determine the largest one.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of possible non-cyclic torsion groups (n2, n1) for Z/n2Z x Z/n1Z\n    # based on the known classification for the field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    # We use the standard form where n2 divides n1.\n    possible_groups = []\n\n    # Groups of the form Z/2Z x Z/2NZ for N in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}\n    for N in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]:\n        possible_groups.append((2, 2 * N))\n\n    # Groups of the form Z/3Z x Z/3NZ for N in {1, 2}\n    for N in [1, 2]:\n        possible_groups.append((3, 3 * N))\n\n    # The group Z/4Z x Z/4Z\n    possible_groups.append((4, 4))\n\n    # The group Z/6Z x Z/6Z\n    possible_groups.append((6, 6))\n\n    max_order = 0\n    best_group = None\n\n    print(\"Checking possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over Q(sqrt(-3)):\")\n    for n2, n1 in possible_groups:\n        order = n2 * n1\n        print(f\"Group: Z/{n2}Z x Z/{n1}Z.
