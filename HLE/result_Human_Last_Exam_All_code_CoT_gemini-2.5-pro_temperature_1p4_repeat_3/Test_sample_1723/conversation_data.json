    "My plan is to identify the specific mushroom genus known for producing a blue spore print based on mycological data. I will then present this information using a simple Python script that prints the name of the genus as a string, as per your request to use a code block for the answer.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know the name of the single mushroom genus that produces a blue spore print.\n# This characteristic is extremely rare in the fungal kingdom.\n# While some mushrooms have blue coloring on their caps or stems (like some Cortinarius)\n# or produce blue latex (like Lactarius indigo), their spore prints are different colors\n# (typically rusty brown and yellowish-cream, respectively).\n# The genus known for this unique trait is Entocybe.\n# This script will print the name of that genus.\n\ndef find_blue_spore_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n    \"\"\"\n    genus_name = \"Entocybe\"\n    print(f\"The single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print is: {genus_name}\")\n\nfind_blue_spore_genus()\n```\n<<<Entocybe>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    There is a single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print, what is its name?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
