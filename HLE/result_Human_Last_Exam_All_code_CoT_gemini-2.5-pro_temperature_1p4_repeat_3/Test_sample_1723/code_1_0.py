# The user wants to know the name of the single mushroom genus that produces a blue spore print.
# This characteristic is extremely rare in the fungal kingdom.
# While some mushrooms have blue coloring on their caps or stems (like some Cortinarius)
# or produce blue latex (like Lactarius indigo), their spore prints are different colors
# (typically rusty brown and yellowish-cream, respectively).
# The genus known for this unique trait is Entocybe.
# This script will print the name of that genus.
