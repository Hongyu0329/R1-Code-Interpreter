# As derived in the explanation, the entire complex expression for f(p)
# simplifies to 2 to the power of 81.
# The final equation is f(p) = 2**81.
# Here we calculate this value.

# The numbers in the final simplified equation are the base (2),
# the exponent (81), and the result.
base = 2
exponent = 81
result = base**exponent

# We output each of these numbers as requested by the prompt.
print(base)
print(exponent)
print(result)
