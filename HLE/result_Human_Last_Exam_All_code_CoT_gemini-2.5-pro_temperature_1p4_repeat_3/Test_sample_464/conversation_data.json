    "This is a classic result in the theory of Fourier analysis. The statement is true. Here is a step-by-step proof presented in a Python script format.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the properties of the Fourier transform on Schwartz space. The Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is another Schwartz function.\n2.  I will show that the derivatives of the Fourier transform of `f`, which we'll call `F(ξ)`, evaluated at `ξ = 0`, are directly related to the moments of `f(x)`.\n3.  Using the given condition that all moments of `f` are zero, I will deduce that all derivatives of `F(ξ)` at `ξ = 0` are also zero.\n4.  A Schwartz function is also an analytic function. An analytic function whose value and all derivatives are zero at a single point must be the zero function everywhere. Thus, `F(ξ)` must be identically zero.\n5.  Finally, since the Fourier transform is a one-to-one mapping on the Schwartz space, if the transform `F(ξ)` is zero, the original function `f(x)` must also be zero.\n\n```python\ndef prove_schwartz_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step proof for the problem:\n    If f is a Schwartz function such that the integral of x^k * f(x) is 0 for all k,\n    does it follow that f = 0?\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Proof ---\")\n    print(\"Problem: Suppose f is a Schwartz class function such that ∫(ℝ) x^k * f(x) dx = 0 for all k ∈ ℕ.
