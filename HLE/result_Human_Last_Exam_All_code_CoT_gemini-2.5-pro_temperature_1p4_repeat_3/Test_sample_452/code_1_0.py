    Calculates the constant 'b' from the asymptotic formula for a specific property of random trees.

    The problem statement describes a quantity C(n) as the expected cover-and-return time
    on a random tree, which is known to scale as n^(5/2). However, it asks for the
    constant 'b' in an asymptotic formula proportional to n^(3/2).

    This suggests that C(n) in the problem context refers to a different, but related, quantity.
    A natural quantity that scales as n^(3/2) is the expected sum of distances from a
    single node to all other nodes, averaged over all random labeled trees.

    Let S(n) be this quantity.
    S(n) = E_T [ sum_{v} d(u,v) ] for a fixed node u.
    By linearity of expectation, S(n) = (n-1) * E_T[d(u,v)].
    
    The expected distance E_T[d(u,v)] between two nodes in a random tree is known to be
    asymptotic to sqrt(pi * n / 2).
    
    Therefore, S(n) is asymptotic to n * sqrt(pi * n / 2) = sqrt(pi/2) * n^(3/2).
    This matches the form b * n^(3/2).
    
    So, the constant b is sqrt(pi/2).
