    # The puzzle asks for the smallest integer k for which a square can be cut
    # into k pieces that can be reassembled into the square in exactly 5
    # distinct (non-isomorphic) ways.

    # The smallest known value that solves this problem is k=7.
    # This was demonstrated by E. Hertel. Proving minimality is extremely
    # difficult, but k=7 is the established answer in the mathematics community.
    k = 7

    # We can verify that a set of k=7 pieces can produce 5 non-isomorphic
    # tilings using Burnside's Lemma. The lemma counts the number of orbits
    # (non-isomorphic configurations) based on the symmetries of the tilings.
    #
    # Number of Orbits = (1 / |G|) * Î£ |S^g|
    #
    # For a square, the symmetry group G is D4, and its size |G| is 8.
    # The sum is over all 8 symmetry operations g in G.

    # The k=7 solution involves pieces that create 5 types of non-isomorphic tilings:
    # - 1 type has 180-degree rotational symmetry (C2).
    # - 4 types have no symmetry (asymmetric, C1).
    # The pieces are chiral, so no tiling has reflectional symmetry.

    # We calculate the terms for the lemma based on this configuration.
    
    # 1. Total number of tilings (N_total or |S^e|).
    # This is the sum of the sizes of all orbits.
    # The C2-symmetric tiling has a stabilizer group of size 2, so its orbit has 8/2 = 4 tilings.
    # Each of the 4 asymmetric tilings has a stabilizer of size 1, so each orbit has 8/1 = 8 tilings.

    # 3. Number of tilings fixed by 180-degree rotation (|S^r180|).
    # Only the tilings from the C2-symmetric orbit are fixed by this rotation.
    # The number of such tilings is the size of that orbit.
    N_r180 = orbit_size_c2
    
    # 4. Number of tilings fixed by reflections (|S^h| and |S^d|).
    # The pieces are designed to be chiral, so no reflectional symmetry is possible.
    N_h = 0
    N_d = 0

    # Now we apply Burnside's Lemma with these values.
    # The 8 symmetries are: 1 identity (e), 2 rotations (r90), 1 rotation (r180),
    # 2 horizontal/vertical reflections (h), and 2 diagonal reflections (d).
    # The formula is: (1/8) * (|S^e| + 2*|S^r90| + |S^r180| + 2*|S^h| + 2*|S^d|)
