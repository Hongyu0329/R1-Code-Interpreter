    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to determine the IUPAC name of the product, followed by the Python code to display the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction between a sulfoxide (methyl phenyl sulfoxide), an activating agent (triflic anhydride), and a nucleophile (trimethylsilyl cyanide) is a classic example of a **Pummerer reaction**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactants' Roles:**\n    *   **Methyl phenyl sulfoxide (Ph-S(=O)-Me):** This is the substrate. The protons on the methyl group are adjacent to the sulfur and will become acidic upon activation.\n    *   **Triflic anhydride (Tf₂O):** This is a very powerful electrophilic activator. The sulfoxide's oxygen atom will attack it, making the oxygen a part of an excellent leaving group (a triflate ester).\n    *   **Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN):** This serves as the source for the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻).\n\n3.  **Outline the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Activation.** The sulfoxide oxygen attacks the triflic anhydride, forming a highly reactive sulfonium salt intermediate, `[Ph-S(+)(OTf)-Me]`.\n    *   **Step 2: Deprotonation.** The protons on the methyl group are now highly acidic. A weak base (like the triflate anion formed in step 1) removes a proton to form a sulfur ylide.\n    *   **Step 3: Rearrangement.** The ylide rearranges. The triflate group leaves, and a resonance-stabilized thionium ion, `[Ph-S=CH₂]⁺`, is formed.\n    *   **Step 4: Nucleophilic Attack.** The cyanide anion (CN⁻) from TMSCN attacks the electrophilic methylene carbon (`=CH₂`) of the thionium ion.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product:** This sequence of steps results in the formation of a new carbon-sulfur bond and a carbon-carbon bond, yielding the product with the structure `Ph-S-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Derive the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The principal functional group in the product is the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   The parent molecule is acetonitrile (CH₃CN), whose systematic IUPAC name is ethanenitrile. The carbon of the nitrile is C1, and the adjacent methyl carbon is C2.\n    *   Our product has a substituent on the C2 carbon.\n    *   The substituent is the `Ph-S-` group, which is named **phenylsulfanyl** (or phenylthio).\n    *   Combining these parts, we get the name: **2-(Phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile**. The number `2` indicates the position of the substituent.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the IUPAC name of the product from the described reaction.\n    The reaction is a Pummerer reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic\n    anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide.\n    The final product is Ph-S-CH2-CN.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The parent chain is acetonitrile (or ethanenitrile).\n    # The substituent at position 2 is a phenylsulfanyl group.\n    # The number '2' is part of the IUPAC name.\n    product_name = \"2-(Phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile\"\n    print(f\"The IUPAC name of the final product is: {product_name}\")\n\nget_product_iupac_name()\n```\n<<<2-(Phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile>>>"
