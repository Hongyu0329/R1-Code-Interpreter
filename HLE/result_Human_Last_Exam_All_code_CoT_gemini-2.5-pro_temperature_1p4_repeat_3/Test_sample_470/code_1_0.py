# Step 1: Determine k(B), the number of irreducible ordinary characters in the block B.
# From the theory of blocks with abelian defect groups, we found that k(B) is the
# number of irreducible characters of the inertial quotient E.
# Since E is a cyclic group of order 5, it has 5 irreducible characters.
k_B = 5

# Step 2: Determine l(B), the number of irreducible Brauer characters in the block B.
# We found that l(B) is the number of simple modules for the group algebra F[E],
# which is the number of irreducible factors of x^5 - 1 over F_2.
# The factorization is (x + 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1), which consists of 2 irreducible factors.
l_B = 2

# Step 3: Compute the difference k(B) - l(B).
result = k_B - l_B

# Step 4: Print the final equation.
