    print("A. Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("   Analysis: TRUE. The KKT constraint sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0 requires support vectors (where alpha_i > 0)")

    # Statement B
    print("B. With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("   Analysis: TRUE. Class-weighted SVMs use different penalty parameters (C) for each class,")
    print("   effectively creating different soft-margin sizes to better handle imbalanced data.\n")

    # Statement C
    print("C. Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("   Analysis: TRUE. This is the 'kernel trick'. The RBF kernel, for example, maps to an")
    print("   infinite-dimensional space, but its computation is tractable as we only need the dot product, not the explicit mapping.\n")

    # Statement D
    print("D. It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("   Analysis: TRUE. The decision boundary is defined only by support vectors. Points correctly classified")
    print("   and far from the margin do not influence the boundary's position.\n")

    # Statement E
    print("E. Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("   Analysis: FALSE. A strictly convex function is not guaranteed to have a global minimizer.")
    print("   For example, the function f(x) = e^x is strictly convex but has no minimum value on the set of real numbers; it only has an infimum of 0.\n")

    print("Conclusion: Statement E is the only one that is not true.")
