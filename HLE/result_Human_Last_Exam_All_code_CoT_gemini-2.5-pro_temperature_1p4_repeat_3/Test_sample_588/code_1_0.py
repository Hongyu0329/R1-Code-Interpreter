# The problem asks for a tuple of pairs (a_i, b_i) describing manifolds M(a_i, b_i) that are not "full",
# such that their connect-sum IS "full". The tuple should be lexicographically least with a minimal number of pairs.

# Step 1: A smooth n-manifold M is "full" if its tangent bundle TM admits a metric of every index k from 1 to n.
# This is equivalent to the condition that the total Stiefel-Whitney class is w(TM) = (1+x)^n for some x in H^1(M; Z_2).
# For the 4-manifolds M(a,b) in this problem, the condition is w(T(M(a,b))) = (1+x)^4 = 1 + x^4.

# Step 2: The manifolds are M(a,b) = M(a) x M(b), where M(g) is a closed orientable surface of genus g.
# The surfaces M(g) are complex manifolds. The tangent bundle TM(g) is a complex vector bundle.
# For any complex vector bundle, the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2 is the first Chern class c_1 reduced modulo 2.
# The first Chern class of the tangent bundle, c_1(TM(g)), is equal to the Euler class e(TM(g)).
# The integral of e(TM(g)) over M(g) is the Euler characteristic chi(M(g)) = 2 - 2g.
# In cohomology, c_1(TM(g)) corresponds to the integer (2 - 2g).
# Thus, w_2(TM(g)) is the mod 2 reduction of this integer, which is (2 - 2g) mod 2 = 0. This holds for any genus g.
# Since M(g) is orientable, w_1(TM(g)) = 0.
# Therefore, the total Stiefel-Whitney class for any surface M(g) is w(TM(g)) = 1.

# Step 3: For the product manifold M(a,b), the total Stiefel-Whitney class is the product of the (pulled-back) classes of the factors:
# w(T(M(a,b))) = w(TM(a)) * w(TM(b)) = 1 * 1 = 1.

# Step 4: To check if M(a,b) is full, we see if w = 1 can be written as 1 + x^4 for some x in H^1.
# This is satisfied by choosing x = 0, which is always an element of H^1.
# Therefore, every manifold M(a,b) is full.

# Step 5: The problem asks to select manifolds from the set of non-full M(a,b).
# Since all M(a,b) are full, this set is empty.

# Step 6: The only way to choose a list of items from an empty set is to choose 0 items.
# Thus, the number of manifolds in the connect-sum, l, must be 0.
# The corresponding list of pairs (a_i, b_i) is empty.

# Step 7: The connect-sum of 0 manifolds is defined as the sphere of the same dimension, S^4.
# We must check if S^4 is full. The tangent bundle of S^4 has w(TS^4) = 1.
# This fits the condition 1 + x^4 for x = 0. So S^4 is full.

# Step 8: The conditions of the problem are satisfied with l=0.
# The minimal l is 0, and the corresponding tuple is the empty tuple.

# Final Answer: The empty tuple.
