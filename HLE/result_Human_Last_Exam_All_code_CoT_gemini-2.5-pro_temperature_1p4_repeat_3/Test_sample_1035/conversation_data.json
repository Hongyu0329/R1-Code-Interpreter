    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all edges of the complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the problem:** This graph theory problem can be translated into a coding theory problem. Each of the $n$ vertices of $K_n$ is assigned a unique \"code\" vector of length $k$. The number $k$ represents the number of bipartite graphs in our family. Each position in the vector corresponds to one bipartite graph. A code vector consists of symbols from $\\{0, 1, *\\}$.\n    *   If the $i$-th symbol for a vertex $v$ is `0` or `1`, it means $v$ is in the $i$-th bipartite graph, in partition 0 or 1, respectively.\n    *   If the symbol is `*` (a wildcard), it means vertex $v$ is not in the $i$-th bipartite graph.\n2.  **Covering condition:** For any two vertices $u$ and $v$, their connecting edge $(u,v)$ must be covered by some bipartite graph $B_i$. This means that for some position $i$ in their code vectors, one must have a `0` and the other a `1`. This ensures they are in the graph $B_i$ and in different partitions. This is called a \"separating system\" of codes.\n3.  **Cost function:** The total number of vertices in the family of graphs is $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$. In our coding model, this sum corresponds to the total count of non-`*` symbols over all $n$ code vectors assigned to the vertices. Our goal is to minimize this total count.\n4.  **Minimization strategy:** To minimize the total count of non-`*` symbols, we should choose codes that are \"cheap,\" i.e., have the fewest non-`*` symbols (lowest \"weight\"). For a chosen number of bipartite graphs, $k$, we must find $n=35$ distinct, separating codes. The most efficient way is to select the $n$ codes with the lowest weights. The number of available codes of weight $j$ (having $j$ non-`*` symbols) is given by $\\binom{k}{j} \\times 2^j$.\n5.  **Algorithm:** We will write a Python script to calculate the minimum cost. The script will iterate through possible values of $k$ (the number of bipartite graphs) and, for each $k$, calculate the lowest possible total weight by picking the 35 cheapest codes. The overall minimum over all tested $k$ will be the answer. The number of available codes for a given $k$ must be at least $n=35$, which sets a lower bound on $k$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_min_vertices(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all edges of the complete graph K_n.\n\n    This function iterates through possible numbers of bipartite graphs (k)\n    and calculates the minimum cost for each k.
