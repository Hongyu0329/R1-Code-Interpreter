    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition:** First, I need to establish the definition of a \"generalized Markov number\" \\(m_{p/q}\\). The term can have different meanings in different mathematical contexts. I will use the definition prominent in the study of cluster algebras, which is computationally well-defined.\n2.  **Continued Fraction of p/q:** According to this definition, the calculation starts with the continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\). For the given \\(p/q = 4/7\\), I will compute its continued fraction coefficients, let's call them \\(C = (c_1, c_2, ..., c_k)\\).\n3.  **Matrix Calculation:** These coefficients are used to construct a product of 2x2 matrices. For each coefficient \\(c_i\\), we define a matrix \\(M_{c_i} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_i & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\). The overall matrix, let's call it \\(K(C)\\), is the product \\(K(C) = M_{c_1} M_{c_2} \\cdots M_{c_k}\\).\n4.  **Compute \\(m_{p/q}\\):** The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is then defined as the trace of the resulting matrix \\(K(C)\\) divided by the denominator \\(q\\). That is, \\(m_{p/q} = \\frac{\\text{tr}(K(C))}{q}\\).\n5.  **Compute the Final Continued Fraction:** The problem asks for the continued fraction *associated with* \\(m_{4/7}\\). I will interpret this as computing the continued fraction of the number \\(m_{4/7}\\) itself. Since \\(m_{4/7}\\) will be a rational number, its continued fraction will be finite.\n6.  **Format the Output:** The final step is to display the result as an equation, clearly showing the original fraction, its value, and its continued fraction expansion, as requested. I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and format the output.\n\nThis step-by-step process provides a clear and verifiable path from the input \\(p/q\\) to the final desired continued fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_cf_coeffs(p, q):\n    \"\"\"Computes the continued fraction coefficients for a rational number p/q.\"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    if q == 0:\n        return []\n    while q != 0:\n        coeffs.append(p // q)\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    return coeffs\n\ndef matrix_multiply(A, B):\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two 2x2 matrices.\"\"\"\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    C[0][0] = A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]\n    C[0][1] = A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]\n    C[1][0] = A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0]\n    C[1][1] = A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]\n    return C\n\ndef format_cf_equation(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Formats a list of continued fraction coefficients into a string equation.\"\"\"\n    if not coeffs:\n        return \"0\"\n    if len(coeffs) == 1:\n        return str(coeffs[0])\n    \n    # Recursively build the string from the tail\n    def build_string(c_list):\n        if len(c_list) == 1:\n            return str(c_list[0])\n        else:\n            return f\"{c_list[0]} + 1/({build_string(c_list[1:])})\"\n\n    return build_string(coeffs)\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Get the continued fraction of p/q = [0; c1, c2, ...]\n    # We only need the coefficients after the first one (the integer part, which is 0).\n    cf_pq_coeffs = get_cf_coeffs(p, q)[1:]\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the matrix product K(C)\n    # K(C) = M_c1 * M_c2 * ... * M_ck\n    K_C = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Start with identity matrix\n    for c in cf_pq_coeffs:\n        M_c = [[c, 1], [1, 0]]\n        K_C = matrix_multiply(K_C, M_c)\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the generalized Markov number m_{p/q} = tr(K(C)) / q\n    trace = K_C[0][0] + K_C[1][1]\n    m_num = trace\n    m_den = q\n    \n    # Simplify the fraction\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(m_num, m_den)\n    m_num //= common_divisor\n    m_den //= common_divisor\n\n    # Step 4: Compute the continued fraction of m_{p/q}\n    m_cf_coeffs = get_cf_coeffs(m_num, m_den)\n\n    # Step 5: Format the output\n    cf_eq_str = format_cf_equation(m_cf_coeffs)\n\n    print(f\"The continued fraction for p/q = {p}/{q} is [0; {', '.join(map(str, cf_pq_coeffs))}].\")\n    print(f\"The matrix K(C) is [[{K_C[0][0]}, {K_C[0][1]}], [{K_C[1][0]}, {K_C[1][1]}]].\")\n    print(f\"The trace of K(C) is {trace}.\")\n    print(f\"The generalized Markov number m_{p/q} is trace/q = {trace}/{q}.\")\n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"m_{p}/{q} = {m_num}/{m_den}\")\n    # The prompt requests the final equation with all numbers.\n    final_eq = f\"{m_num}/{m_den} = {cf_eq_str}\"\n    \n    # Let's extract and print the numbers in the equation for clarity\n    all_numbers = [m_num, m_den] + m_cf_coeffs\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {final_eq}\")\n    print(f\"The numbers in the final equation are: {', '.join(map(str, all_numbers))}\")\n\n\n# Given p/q = 4/7\np_val = 4\nq_val = 7\ncompute_generalized_markov_cf(p_val, q_val)\n\n```\n<<<[1, 7]>>>"
