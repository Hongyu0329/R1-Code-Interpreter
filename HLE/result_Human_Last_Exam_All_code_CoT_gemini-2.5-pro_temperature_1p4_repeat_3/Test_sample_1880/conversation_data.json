    "To find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of an irreducible quartic polynomial.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, we must confirm that the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We will use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant**: The discriminant ($\\Delta$) of the polynomial will be calculated. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. Otherwise, it is not.\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: We will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with our quartic.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: We'll check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by searching for rational roots. The reducibility of the resolvent cubic provides crucial information about the structure of the Galois group.\n5.  **Identify the Galois Group**: By combining the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, we can narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group from the five possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ ($S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4, V_4$).\n6.  **Determine the Order**: Once the group is identified, its order is known.\n\nThis step-by-step process will be implemented in the Python script below.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = math.isqrt(n)\n    return x * x == n\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over the rational numbers Q.\")\n    print(\"We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2.\")\n    print(\"The coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 8, 14.\")\n    print(\"The prime p=2 divides all coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14) except the leading one (1).\")\n    print(\"p^2=4 does not divide the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\n    # For a depressed quartic x^4 + px + q, the discriminant is Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant Delta.\")\n    delta = 256 * (q**3) - 27 * (p**4)\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * ({q}^3) - 27 * ({p}^4)\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * {q**3} - 27 * {p**4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {256 * q**3} - {27 * p**4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {delta}\")\n    \n    is_square = is_perfect_square(delta)\n    print(f\"\\nIs the discriminant {delta} a perfect square? {is_square}.\")\n    if not is_square:\n        print(\"Since the discriminant is not a perfect square in Q, the Galois group is not a subgroup of A_4.\")\n        print(\"This rules out A_4 and V_4 (the Klein four-group).\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Since the discriminant is a perfect square in Q, the Galois group is a subgroup of A_4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Form the resolvent cubic\n    # For x^4 + px + q, the resolvent cubic is y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0\n    print(\"Step 3: Form the resolvent cubic polynomial.\")\n    c0 = -p**2\n    c1 = -4 * q\n    c2 = 0\n    c3 = 1\n    print(f\"The resolvent cubic is y^3 - 4*({q})*y - ({p}^2) = 0\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: y^3 + {c1}y + {c0} = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 4: Check for rational roots of the resolvent cubic\n    print(\"Step 4: Check for rational roots of the resolvent cubic.\")\n    print(\"By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term.\")\n    constant_term = -c0\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, int(abs(constant_term)**0.5) + 1):\n        if constant_term % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n            divisors.append(-i)\n            if i*i != constant_term:\n                divisors.append(constant_term // i)\n                divisors.append(-constant_term // i)\n    \n    rational_root = None\n    for r in sorted(list(set(divisors))):\n        if r**3 + c1 * r + c0 == 0:\n            rational_root = r\n            break\n            \n    if rational_root is not None:\n        print(f\"A rational root was found: y = {rational_root}.\")\n        print(\"Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over Q.\")\n        print(\"This rules out the group S_4.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No rational roots were found.
