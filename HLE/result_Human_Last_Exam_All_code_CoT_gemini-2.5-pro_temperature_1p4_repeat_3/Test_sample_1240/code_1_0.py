# The core of the argument:
# 1. Assume we have a D_k component on indices I_k and a D_l on I_l.
# 2. This requires the glue vector component u_i to be 0 (mod 5) for any index i in these sets.
# 3. We check a "cross-root" vector v = e_i + e_j connecting I_k and I_l.
# 4. The dot product u.v equals u_i + u_j. We check if this is 0 mod 5.
