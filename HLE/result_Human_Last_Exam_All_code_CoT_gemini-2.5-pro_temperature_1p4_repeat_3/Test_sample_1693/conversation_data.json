    "I will identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the Armistice of 22 June 1940. To do this, I will search naval loss records from the beginning of World War II until that date, focusing on French vessels and their cause of sinking. I will then compare the displacement of the identified ships to find the largest one.\n\nThe script below will store the information about the identified ship and print the details of its sinking.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat\n    before the Armistice of June 22, 1940.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ship details based on historical records.\n    ship_name = \"Champlain\"\n    ship_type = \"passenger liner\"\n    displacement = 28340  # in tons\n    sinking_date = \"17 June 1940\"\n    armistice_date = \"22 June 1940\"\n    u_boat = \"U-65\"\n    cause = f\"a mine laid by the German submarine {u_boat}\"\n\n    # Print the details of the findings.\n    print(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of {armistice_date} was the {ship_type} '{ship_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"Details of the event:\")\n    print(f\"- Ship Displacement: {displacement} tons\")\n    print(f\"- Date Sunk: {sinking_date}\")\n    print(f\"- U-boat Responsible: {u_boat}\")\n    print(f\"- Cause of Sinking: The ship struck {cause}.\")\n\nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Champlain>>>"
