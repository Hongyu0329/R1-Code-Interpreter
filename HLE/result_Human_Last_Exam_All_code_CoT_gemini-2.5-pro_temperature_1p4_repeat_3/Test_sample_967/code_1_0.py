    This script calculates the first l2-Betti number of the fundamental group G
    of the graph of groups X described in the problem.

    The steps are:
    1. Define the properties of the Petersen graph P.
    2. Calculate the number of vertices and edges of its line graph L(P).
    3. Calculate the first Betti number of L(P), b1(L(P)).
    4. Determine the l2-Betti numbers of the vertex and edge groups.
    5. Combine these values using the formula for the l2-Betti number of a
       fundamental group of a graph of groups.
