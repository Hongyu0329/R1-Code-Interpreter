    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm, we combine the antecedent firing level with the consequent membership grade. A t-norm is a function that models the fuzzy logical AND operation. The most common and fundamental t-norm is the **minimum** function.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two given values: the antecedent firing level `Phi_k(x′)` and the consequent membership grade `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm, which calculates the minimum of these two values.\n3.  Print the full equation showing the inputs and the calculated result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_activation_level():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level using a t-norm operation.\n\n    The problem provides:\n    - Antecedent firing level, Phi_k(x'): 0.7\n    - Consequent membership grade, muG_k_j(y_j): 0.9\n\n    The t-norm operation combines these values. We will use the most\n    common t-norm, which is the minimum function.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the given values\n    antecedent_firing_level = 0.7\n    consequent_membership_grade = 0.9\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the minimum t-norm to calculate the activation level\n    activation_level = min(antecedent_firing_level, consequent_membership_grade)\n\n    # Step 3: Print the final equation and the result\n    print(\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = min({antecedent_firing_level}, {consequent_membership_grade}) = {activation_level}\")\n\ncalculate_activation_level()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
