    print("  - Somatic Instability: The process where these CTG repeats expand in length over time in somatic cells.")

    # Step 2: Explain the mechanism of CTG repeat expansion.
    print("Step 2: How do CTG repeats expand?")
    print("  - During DNA replication, the repetitive CTG sequence can form a stable hairpin loop on the newly synthesized DNA strand.")
    print("  - This hairpin contains extra repeat units, creating a longer-than-normal DNA fragment (an Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand).")

    # Step 3: Explain the critical role of LIG1 in the expansion process.
    print("Step 3: What is LIG1's role in this expansion?")
    print("  - For this expansion to become a permanent part of the chromosome, the fragment containing the hairpin must be sealed, or 'ligated', into the new DNA strand.")
    print("  - This ligation is a primary function of LIG1.")
    print("  - LIG1 effectively 'locks in' the expansion.")

    print("Step 4: What happens if LIG1 is absent?")
    print("  - Without LIG1, the final 'sealing' step is impaired.")
    print("  - The unligated fragment with the extra repeats is recognized as an error by DNA repair machinery.")
    print("  - This aberrant structure is often removed, preventing the expansion from becoming permanent.")

# Final Answer
# A. Increased instability - Incorrect.
# B. Contraction of repeat length - Possible, but "Reduced instability" is a more accurate and comprehensive answer.
# C. Reduced instability - Correct. The mechanism for expansion is disrupted.
# D. No impact - Incorrect. LIG1 is a key player.
# E. Knockout is lethal - While true for a complete organismal knockout, it doesn't describe the impact on the molecular mechanism, which is studied via knockdown or in cell systems.

# The final answer is C.
