# The dimensionless part of the Lindhard function F(x) is given by:
# F(x) = A + B(x)
# where A = 1/2 and B(x) = (1-x^2)/(4x) * ln((1+x)/(1-x)).
# We need to find the value of F(x) as x approaches 0.

# The first term is a constant.
term_A = 0.5

# The second term is an indeterminate form 0/0.
# Its limit as x -> 0 can be found using L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series expansion.
# The result of this limit is 0.5.
limit_of_term_B = 0.5

# The final result is the sum of the constant term and the limit of the second term.
result = term_A + limit_of_term_B

# The final equation is the sum of these two numerical components.
