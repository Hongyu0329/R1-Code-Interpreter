    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct structures a category can have, given it has exactly one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the structure:** A category with a single object, let's call it `X`, is known as a **monoid**.\n    *   The morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid. Here, we have 3 morphisms.\n    *   The composition of morphisms (`∘`) corresponds to the monoid's binary operation.\n    *   The identity morphism (`id_X`) corresponds to the monoid's identity element.\n    *   The associativity of morphism composition is the same as the associativity of the monoid operation.\n\n2.  **Formalize the problem:** We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    *   Let the set of morphisms be `M = {id, a, b}`. `id` is the identity element.\n    *   The composition operation is a 3x3 multiplication table. The row and column for `id` are fixed by the identity property (`id ∘ x = x` and `x ∘ id = x`).\n    *   We only need to define the products for the non-identity elements: `{a, b}`. There are four such products: `a ∘ a`, `a ∘ b`, `b ∘ a`, and `b ∘ b`.\n    *   Each of these four products can be `id`, `a`, or `b`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables.\n\n3.  **Filter for valid categories (monoids):** We need to check which of these 81 tables satisfy the associativity axiom: `(x ∘ y) ∘ z = x ∘ (y ∘ z)` for all `x, y, z` in `M`.\n\n4.  **Count \"up to isomorphism\":** Two categories (monoids) are considered isomorphic if they have the same structure, even if the names of the non-identity morphisms are swapped. In our case, the monoid defined by the multiplication of `{a, b}` is isomorphic to another if we can get the second one by consistently swapping `a` and `b` in the first one's multiplication table. We need to find the number of unique structures after accounting for this swapping.\n\n5.  **Execution via code:** We will write a Python script to perform this systematic check:\n    *   Iterate through all 81 possible multiplication tables.\n    *   For each table, check if it's associative.\n    *   For each valid (associative) table, find its \"canonical form\". The canonical form of a table is the lexicographically smallest version between itself and the table generated by swapping `a` and `b`.\n    *   Count the number of unique canonical forms. This count will be our final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and\n    three morphisms.
