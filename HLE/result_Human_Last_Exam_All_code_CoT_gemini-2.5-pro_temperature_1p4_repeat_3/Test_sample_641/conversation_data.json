    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we can use a known formula derived from the group's structure.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and Definitions:** The group is G = PSU(n, q) with n=4 and q=997. An involution is an element `x` of order 2, meaning `x^2 = 1` and `x` is not the identity.\n2.  **Relate to SU(n, q):** The number of involutions in PSU(n,q) is related to the number of elements `g` in the special unitary group SU(n,q) for which `g^2` lies in the center Z(SU(n,q)). The center Z has size `d = gcd(n, q+1)`. For our case, `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n3.  **Count Pre-images:** We need to count elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = I` (involutions in SU) or `g^2 = -I`.\n4.  **Case Analysis:**\n    *   For `q = 997`, which satisfies `q â‰¡ 1 (mod 4)`, it can be shown that there are no elements `g` in SU(4, q) such that `g^2 = -I`.\n    *   Therefore, we only need to count the number of involutions in SU(4, q).\n5.  **Formula for Involutions in SU(4, q):** The number of involutions in SU(4, q) is given by the formula:\n    `N = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is the number of their pre-images in SU(4, q) divided by the size of the center `d=2`. So the final number is `N / 2`.\n7.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python script to compute this value and print the final equation with all its numerical components, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # The formula for the number of involutions in PSU(n, q) for n=4 and q === 1 (mod 4)\n    # is (q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2.\n\n    # Calculate the components of the numerator\n    q_pow_4 = q**4\n    term1 = q**2 - q + 1\n    term2 = q**2 + 1\n\n    # The numerator is the number of involutions in SU(4, q)\n    numerator = q_pow_4 * term1 * term2\n\n    # The result is the numerator divided by the size of the center, which is 2.\n    result = numerator // 2\n\n    # As requested, printing the final equation with each number.\n    print(f\"The number of involutions is given by the equation:\")\n    print(f\"({q_pow_4} * {term1} * {term2}) / 2 = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<487596956295329948835815>>>"
