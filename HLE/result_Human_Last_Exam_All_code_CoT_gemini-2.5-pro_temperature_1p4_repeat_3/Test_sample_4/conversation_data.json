    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Lie algebra**: We first observe that the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be understood as a fiber product. The relations involve two separate chains of dependencies initiated by $e_1$.\n    *   One part involves $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ with relations $[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4$. Let's call this Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}_1$. This is a 4-dimensional filiform nilpotent Lie algebra.\n    *   The other part involves $\\{e_1, e_5, e_6\\}$ with the relation $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. This is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra, let's call it $\\mathfrak{g}_2$.\n    *   Both algebras share the subalgebra $\\mathfrak{c} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$, which is the 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   The algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the fiber product (or pullback) of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ over $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Polynomial of a Fiber Product**: The cohomology of such a fiber product can be computed using a Mayer-Vietoris sequence. For the Poincaré polynomials, this leads to the formula:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)}{P_{\\mathfrak{c}}(x)}$\n    This formula is valid because the cohomologies of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ are free modules over the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n3.  **Computing Individual Poincaré Polynomials**:\n    *   **For $\\mathfrak{c} = \\mathbb{R}$**: The Chevalley-Eilenberg complex is just $\\Lambda(e^1)$ with a zero differential. The Betti numbers are $b_0=1, b_1=1$. So, $P_{\\mathfrak{c}}(x) = 1+x$.\n    *   **For $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\mathfrak{h}_3$ (Heisenberg algebra)**: A standard result gives its Poincaré polynomial as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x) = 1+2x+2x^2+x^3$.\n    *   **For $\\mathfrak{g}_1$**: A direct calculation of the Betti numbers using its Chevalley-Eilenberg complex yields $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=2, b_4=1$. So, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) = 1+2x+2x^2+2x^3+x^4$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: We can simplify the fraction by factoring the polynomials.\n    *   $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2+x^3)$\n    *   $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$\n    *   $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1+x)(1+x+x^2+x^3) \\cdot (1+x)(1+x+x^2)}{1+x} = (1+x)(1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x+x^2)$.\n    \nWe will now use a Python script to perform this polynomial multiplication and present the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef poly_mult(p1_coeffs, p2_coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two polynomials given as lists of coefficients.\"\"\"\n    return np.convolve(p1_coeffs, p2_coeffs).tolist()\n\ndef format_poly(p_coeffs, name=\"P(x)\"):\n    \"\"\"Formats a polynomial for printing.\"\"\"\n    terms = []\n    # Iterate in reverse to get descending powers of x\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(p_coeffs):\n        coeff = int(round(coeff))\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Format coefficient\n        if coeff == 1 and i > 0:\n            c_str = \"\"\n        else:\n            c_str = str(coeff)\n\n        # Format variable part\n        if i == 0:\n            v_str = \"\"\n        elif i == 1:\n            v_str = \"x\"\n        else:\n            v_str = f\"x^{i}\"\n        \n        if c_str and v_str:\n            terms.append(f\"{c_str}{v_str}\")\n        else:\n            terms.append(f\"{c_str or v_str}\")\n\n    if not terms:\n        return f\"{name} = 0\"\n    return f\"{name} = {' + '.join(terms)}\"\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Define the factors of the Poincaré polynomial for g.\")\n\np1 = {'name': '1+x', 'coeffs': [1, 1]}\np2 = {'name': '1+x+x^2', 'coeffs': [1, 1, 1]}\np3 = {'name': '1+x+x^2+x^3', 'coeffs': [1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\nprint(\"The Poincaré polynomial is a product of three factors:\")\nprint(format_poly(p1['coeffs'], p1['name']))\nprint(format_poly(p2['coeffs'], p2['name']))\nprint(format_poly(p3['coeffs'], p3['name']))\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Compute the product of these polynomials.\")\n\nprint(\"First, multiply (1+x+x^2) and (1+x+x^2+x^3).\")\nprod1_coeffs = poly_mult(p2['coeffs'], p3['coeffs'])\nprint(format_poly(prod1_coeffs, f\"({p2['name']})({p3['name']})\"))\n\nprint(\"\\nNow, multiply the result by (1+x).\")\nfinal_coeffs = poly_mult(prod1_coeffs, p1['coeffs'])\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final Poincaré polynomial for g is:\")\n\n# Custom formatting for the final answer\nterms = []\nfor i, coeff in enumerate(final_coeffs):\n    coeff = int(round(coeff))\n    if coeff == 0:\n        continue\n    c_str = str(coeff)\n    if i == 0:\n        v_str = \"\"\n    elif i == 1:\n        v_str = \"x\"\n    else:\n        v_str = f\"x^{i}\"\n    \n    if v_str:\n        if coeff == 1:\n            terms.append(v_str)\n        else:\n            terms.append(f\"{c_str} {v_str}\")\n    else:\n        terms.append(c_str)\n\nfinal_poly_str = \" + \".join(terms)\nprint(f\"P_g(x) = {final_poly_str}\")\n\n# Storing the answer in the requested format\nanswer = f\"1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6\"\n```\n<<<1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6>>>"
