# The user is asking to identify a specific physical process.
# Louis Bachelier, in his 1900 thesis "Theory of Speculation," developed a mathematical model for stock price movements.
# This model was based on the idea of a "random walk," where price changes are unpredictable over any time interval.
# He discovered that this mathematical framework was identical to that of a well-known physical phenomenon:
# the random, erratic movement of particles suspended in a fluid (like pollen grains in water).

# Define the name of this physical process.
physical_process = "Brownian motion"

# Print the final answer.
print(f"The physical process is: {physical_process}")
