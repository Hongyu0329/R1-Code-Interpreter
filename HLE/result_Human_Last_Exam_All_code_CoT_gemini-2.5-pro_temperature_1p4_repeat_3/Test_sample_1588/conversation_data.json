    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a known result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The BCH formula provides an expression for `Z` in `e^Z = e^X e^Y` as a series of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`. The terms of a specific order `n` in this expansion correspond to a basis of the homogeneous subspace of degree `n` of the free Lie algebra generated by `X` and `Y`.\n\nThe dimension of this subspace, which equals the number of independent commutators (and thus nonzero coefficients) of order `n`, is given by Witt's formula.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n\n1.  **State Witt's Formula**: The formula for the dimension `L_n(k)` of the `n`-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on `k` generators is:\n    `L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(n/d) * k^d`\n    where the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Identify Parameters**: For this problem, we are interested in order `n=10` and we have two generators, `X` and `Y`, so `k=2`.\n\n3.  **Implement Helper Functions in Python**:\n    *   A function to find all divisors of `n`.\n    *   A function to compute the Möbius function `μ(m)`. This requires finding the prime factorization of `m`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula**:\n    *   Find the divisors `d` of `n=10`.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, calculate the corresponding term `μ(10/d) * 2^d`.\n    *   Sum these terms.\n    *   Divide the total sum by `n=10` to get the final answer.\n\n5.  **Generate the Output**: The code will print out each step of the calculation, showing the values for each divisor, the final summation, and the result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) returns {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while temp_num % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Mobius function mu(n).\n    mu(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0  # n has a squared prime factor\n    \n    # n is square-free\n    if len(factors) % 2 == 1:\n        return -1 # odd number of prime factors\n    else:\n        return 1 # even number of prime factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_coeffs(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order n for k generators\n    using Witt's formula and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order n={n} for k={k} generators is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * Σ_{{d|{n}}} μ({n}/d) * {k}^d\\n\")\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The positive divisors of n={n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_terms_str = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        m = n // d\n        mu_m = mobius(m)\n        k_d = k ** d\n        term = mu_m * k_d\n        \n        print(f\"Term for d={d}:\")\n        print(f\"  μ({n}/{d}) * {k}^{d} = μ({m}) * {k_d} = {mu_m} * {k_d} = {term}\")\n        \n        total_sum += term\n        sum_terms_str.append(f\"({term})\" if term < 0 else str(term))\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    print(\"\\nSumming the terms:\")\n    equation = f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(sum_terms_str) + \" ]\"\n    print(equation)\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = {total_sum} / {n}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients is: {result}\")\n    \n    return result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    n_order = 10\n    k_generators = 2\n    \n    final_answer = calculate_bch_coeffs(n_order, k_generators)\n    # The final answer in the required format will be generated by the user's framework.\n    # For a standalone script, one would print it like this:\n    # print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<99>>>"
