    "To find the first two non-zero digits of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine the first two digits of its mantissa in scientific notation. We can achieve this by calculating the base-10 logarithm of the number.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Let $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We want to find the first two non-zero digits of $N$.\n2.  We can express $N$ in scientific notation as $N = A \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le A < 10$. The digits of $A$ are the significant digits of $N$.\n3.  To find $A$ and $k$, we take the base-10 logarithm:\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(A \\times 10^k) = \\log_{10}(A) + k$.\n4.  Since $1 \\le A < 10$, we have $0 \\le \\log_{10}(A) < 1$. This means $\\log_{10}(A)$ is the fractional part of $\\log_{10}(N)$ (after adjusting for the negative sign). Let $m = \\log_{10}(A)$, then $A = 10^m$.\n5.  We will compute $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$.\n6.  This calculation involves very large numbers and requires high precision, so we will use Python's `decimal` library.\n7.  We will calculate $X = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$. Then we find its fractional part, $m = X - \\lfloor X \\rfloor$.\n8.  Finally, we compute $A = 10^m$ and extract its first two digits.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a high precision for the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n    print(\"We want to find the first two non-zero digits of N = e^(-7^13).\")\n    print(\"To do this, we'll analyze its base-10 logarithm: log10(N).\")\n    print(\"The governing equation is log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate 7^13\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the value of 7^13.\")\n    val_7_13 = decimal.Decimal(7) ** 13\n    print(f\"7^13 = {val_7_13}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate log10(e)\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate log10(e).\")\n    # log10(e) can be calculated as 1 / ln(10) for high precision.\n    log10_e = decimal.Decimal(1) / decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\n    print(f\"log10(e) â‰ˆ {log10_e}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate log10(N)\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate log10(N) using the equation log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e).\")\n    log_N = -val_7_13 * log10_e\n    print(f\"log10(N) = -{val_7_13} * {log10_e}\")\n    print(f\"log10(N) = {log_N}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Decompose log10(N) to find the mantissa\n    # A number N can be written in scientific notation as A * 10^k.\n    # log10(N) = log10(A) + k.
