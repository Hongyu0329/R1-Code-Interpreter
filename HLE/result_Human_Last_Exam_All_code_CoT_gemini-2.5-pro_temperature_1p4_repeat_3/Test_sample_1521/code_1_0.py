def solve_markov_chain_problem():
    """
    This function prints the solution to the theoretical Markov chain problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:

    Part 1: The original Markov chain must be transient.
    The existence of a non-negative function h that is harmonic outside a finite set A
    and zero on A implies that there is a non-zero probability for the chain to
    never hit A. This can only happen in a transient chain. A recurrent chain
    would visit the finite set A with probability 1, which would imply h must be
    identically zero everywhere, a contradiction. So the first answer is 't'.

    Part 2: The second Markov chain must also be transient.
    This new chain is a Doob's h-transform of the first chain. Since the first
    chain is transient, its Green's function G_p(x, x) is finite. The Green's
    function for the transformed chain, G_q(x, x), is equal to G_p(x, x).
    Since G_q(x, x) is also finite, the second chain must also be transient.
    So the second answer is 't'.
