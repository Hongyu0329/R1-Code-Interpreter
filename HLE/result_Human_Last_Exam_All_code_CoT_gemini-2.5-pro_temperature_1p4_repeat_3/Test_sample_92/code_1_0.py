# Define the positions of the torch and the portal
torch_pos = 2024
portal_pos = 2025
start_pos = 0

# The probability of escaping from bin n is given by a linear function p(n) = A*n + B.
# We have a system of two linear equations from the boundary conditions:
# p(torch_pos) = A * torch_pos + B = 0
# p(portal_pos) = A * portal_pos + B = 1

# We can solve for A and B.
# From the first equation: B = -A * torch_pos
# Substitute into the second equation: A * portal_pos - A * torch_pos = 1
# A * (portal_pos - torch_pos) = 1
A = 1 / (portal_pos - torch_pos)

# Now solve for B:
B = -A * torch_pos

# The probability of escaping from the starting position is p(start_pos):
prob_start = A * start_pos + B

# We are asked to output each number in the final equation.
# prob_start = A * start_pos + B
# prob_start = (1 / (portal_pos - torch_pos)) * start_pos - (1 / (portal_pos - torch_pos)) * torch_pos
# prob_start = (start_pos - torch_pos) / (portal_pos - torch_pos)
