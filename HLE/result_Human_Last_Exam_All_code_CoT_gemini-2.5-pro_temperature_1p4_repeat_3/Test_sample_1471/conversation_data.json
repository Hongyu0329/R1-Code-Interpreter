    "My plan is to first decipher the cuneiform numerals into our modern number system (Arabic numerals). The numerals provided are from the Babylonian sexagesimal (base-60) system.\n\n1.  **Decode the numerals:**\n    *   `പ്പെ` represents 60.\n    *   `𒌋` represents 10.\n    *   `𒁹` represents 1.\n\n2.  **Translate the equation:**\n    *   The first part of the equation is `പ്പെപ്പെ/𒌋𒌋𒌋`.\n        *   `പ്പെപ്പെ` is 60 + 60 = 120.\n        *   `𒌋𒌋𒌋` is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n        *   So, this term is 120 / 30.\n    *   The second part of the equation is `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹`.\n        *   `𒌋𒌋` is 10 + 10 = 20.\n        *   `𒁹𒁹𒁹` is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n        *   So, this number is 20 + 3 = 23.\n\n3.  **Construct and solve the final equation:**\n    *   The equation in modern numbers is: 120 / 30 - 23.\n    *   Solving this gives: 4 - 23 = -19.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result as requested.\n\n```python\n# The problem involves solving an equation with cuneiform numerals.\n# Let's first translate these numerals into modern numbers.\n# പ്പെ = 60\n# 𒌋 = 10\n# 𒁹 = 1\n\n# The first term is പ്പെപ്പെ / 𒌋𒌋𒌋\n# Numerator: പ്പെപ്പെ = 60 + 60 = 120\nnumerator = 120\n# Denominator: 𒌋𒌋𒌋 = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30\ndenominator = 30\n\n# The second term is 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹\n# 𒌋𒌋 = 10 + 10 = 20\n# 𒁹𒁹𒁹 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n# So, the second number is 20 + 3 = 23\nsecond_term = 23\n\n# Now, we calculate the result of the full equation: 120 / 30 - 23\nresult = (numerator / denominator) - second_term\n\n# Finally, we print the equation in modern numbers along with its solution.\nprint(f\"{numerator} / {denominator} - {second_term} = {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<-19>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
