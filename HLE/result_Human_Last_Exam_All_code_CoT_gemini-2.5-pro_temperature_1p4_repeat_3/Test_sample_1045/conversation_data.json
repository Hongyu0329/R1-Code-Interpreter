    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for each atom.\n    *   **For each Carbon atom (C):** It is a second-row element. The 6-31G basis set uses:\n        *   One contracted function for the core 1s orbital.\n        *   Two contracted functions for each valence orbital (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   Total functions per C atom = 1 (for 1s) + 4 orbitals * 2 functions/orbital = 1 + 8 = **9 functions**.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen atom (H):** It is a first-row element. The 6-31G basis set treats its single 1s orbital as valence and splits it into two functions.\n        *   Total functions per H atom = **2 functions**.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each atom by the number of functions it contributes and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# For a 6-31G basis set:\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for a Carbon atom is 9.\n# (1 for the 1s core orbital, and 2 for each of the four valence orbitals: 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz)\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for a Hydrogen atom is 2.\n# (The 1s valence orbital is split into 2 functions)\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the final total\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(\"The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/atom) + ({num_hydrogen} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/atom) = {total_carbon_functions} + {total_hydrogen_functions} = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
