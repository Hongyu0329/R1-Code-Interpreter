    "The user wants to find the number of self-intersection points for the parametric curve `C(t) = (cos(9t), sin(5t))`.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve is a specific type of parametric curve known as a Lissajous curve, which is described by equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + d)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. In this case, `x(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + pi/2)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`. So we have `a=9` and `b=5`.\n\n2.  **Find the relevant formula:** The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve `x = cos(at), y = sin(bt)` where `a` and `b` are coprime integers (meaning their greatest common divisor is 1) is given by a standard formula.\n    *   `GCD(9, 5) = 1`, so the integers are coprime.\n    *   The formula for the number of self-intersection points, `N`, is:\n        `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:** Substitute the given values of `a=9` and `b=5` into the formula.\n    *   `N = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2`\n    *   `N = 8 * 4 / 2`\n    *   `N = 32 / 2`\n    *   `N = 16`\n\n4.  **Create a Python script:** Write a simple Python script to perform this calculation and print the result in a clear, formatted equation as requested.\n\nThe script will define `a` and `b`, calculate the number of intersections, and then print the full calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters 'a' and 'b' from the curve equations x=cos(at) and y=sin(bt)\na = 9\nb = 5\n\n# The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve with coprime integer\n# parameters a and b is given by the formula (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n# We first check if a and b are coprime. The greatest common divisor (GCD) can be found using the math module.\nimport math\nif math.gcd(a, b) == 1:\n    # Calculate the intermediate values\n    val_a = a - 1\n    val_b = b - 1\n    numerator = val_a * val_b\n    \n    # Calculate the final number of self-intersection points\n    num_intersections = numerator / 2\n    \n    # Print the equation and the final answer as requested\n    print(f\"The number of self-intersection points is calculated by the formula (a-1)*(b-1)/2.\")\n    print(f\"For a={a} and b={b}:\")\n    print(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = {int(num_intersections)}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The formula does not apply as 'a' and 'b' are not coprime.\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
