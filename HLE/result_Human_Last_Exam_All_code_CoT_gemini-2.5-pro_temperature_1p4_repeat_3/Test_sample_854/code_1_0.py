    A critical error was made when preparing Batch 3. Chloramphenicol, the antibiotic used to inhibit bacteria, was added to the agar *before* it was autoclaved at {autoclave_temp} degrees Celsius. Chloramphenicol is sensitive to heat (heat-labile) and is destroyed by the high temperatures of an autoclave. The correct procedure is to autoclave the agar first, cool it to a safe temperature (around 45-50Â°C), and then aseptically add the sterile antibiotic. Because of this error, Batch 3 effectively contained no active antibiotic.

    # Step 2: The flawed evidence that misled the lab.
    print("\n[STEP 2: The Flawed Evidence and Misinterpretation]")
    explanation_2 = f"""
    The laboratory believed Batch 3 was safe because it passed their Quality Control (QC) check. They plated a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) on the agar and observed '{observed_qc_result}'. They made a mistake in believing this evidence because the QC test was fundamentally flawed.

    A proper QC test for an antibiotic's effectiveness requires a 'Positive Control'.

    A CORRECT QC design would be:
    1.  Test Plate: Agar + Antibiotic + Bacteria -> Expects NO GROWTH.
    2.  Positive Control Plate: Agar (No Antibiotic) + Bacteria -> Expects GROWTH.

    The Positive Control is essential because it proves the bacteria used for testing are alive and capable of growing on the agar to begin with. The laboratory likely skipped this step.

    By only using the Test Plate, their '{observed_qc_result}' result was meaningless. It could have been caused by two possibilities:
    (A) The antibiotic was working correctly (the lab's incorrect assumption).
    (B) The *Bacillus subtilis* inoculum was not viable or was improperly plated, so nothing would have grown anyway.

    The lab incorrectly assumed reason (A) without ruling out reason (B). This flawed QC evidence gave them false confidence to use the faulty Batch 3.

final_answer = "The laboratory trusted the results of a flawed Quality Control (QC) procedure. Their QC test, which showed no bacterial growth, likely lacked a positive control to confirm the test bacteria were viable. This made the result meaningless and gave them false confidence, causing them to overlook the fact that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed during autoclaving."
