    "Phosphorus has several different forms, known as allotropes, which are stable at various conditions. The most common and well-established of these pure allotropes each have a distinct color. My plan is to identify these primary allotropes and their colors, and then write a Python script to sum them up to answer the question.\n\nThe main allotropes are:\n1.  **White Phosphorus:** A waxy solid that is white or yellowish.\n2.  **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous solid that is red.\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus:** A crystalline form, also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, which is violet.\n4.  **Black Phosphorus:** The most stable form, which has a layered structure similar to graphite and is black.\n\nThe script will assign a value of 1 to each of these four distinct colors and then add them together to find the total number of colors.\n\n```python\n# Each variable represents one distinct color observed in a pure allotrope of phosphorus.\nwhite_phosphorus = 1\nred_phosphorus = 1\nviolet_phosphorus = 1\nblack_phosphorus = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of colors\ntotal_colors = white_phosphorus + red_phosphorus + violet_phosphorus + black_phosphorus\n\n# Print the final equation showing each color being counted\nprint(f\"The number of colors from different pure allotropes of phosphorus is:\")\nprint(f\"{white_phosphorus} (white) + {red_phosphorus} (red) + {violet_phosphorus} (violet) + {black_phosphorus} (black) = {total_colors}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
