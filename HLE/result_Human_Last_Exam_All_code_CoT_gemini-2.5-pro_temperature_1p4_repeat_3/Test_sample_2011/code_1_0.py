    Calculates the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with n vertices.

    The problem is to determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes
    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n vertices.

    Let G be a graph on n vertices. Let omega(G) be the clique number of G,
    which is the size of the largest clique in G.
    If G has a clique S of size omega(G), then the induced subgraph on S is K_{omega(G)}.
    For any integer k where 1 <= k <= omega(G), any subset S' of S with size k
    will also form a complete graph. Thus, G also contains an induced clique of size k.

    This means the set of all possible induced clique sizes in G is {1, 2, ..., omega(G)}.
    The number of different sizes is therefore omega(G).

    To maximize this number, we need to maximize omega(G) for a graph on n vertices.
    The maximum possible clique number for a graph on n vertices is n. This is achieved
    by the complete graph K_n.

    For n = 128, the maximum number of different clique sizes is 128.
