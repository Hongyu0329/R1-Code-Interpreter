    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Interpret the Goal:** The user wants to find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` that has `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure of Induced Cliques:**\n    *   A clique of size `k` (denoted `K_k`) is a set of `k` vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n    *   An *induced subgraph* on a set of vertices `S` includes all vertices in `S` and *all* the edges between them from the original graph.\n    *   Let's assume a graph `G` has an induced clique of a certain maximum size, let's call it `k_max`. This is also known as the *clique number* of the graph, `omega(G)`.\n    *   This means there's a set of `k_max` vertices `S` in `G` that are all mutually connected.\n    *   Now, if we take any smaller subset `S'` from `S` with size `k` (where `1 <= k <= k_max`), the vertices in `S'` are also all mutually connected. The induced subgraph on `S'` is therefore a clique of size `k`, or `K_k`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Problem:** From the analysis above, if a graph contains an induced clique of size `k_max`, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k_max`. Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes for any graph `G` is always `{1, 2, ..., omega(G)}`. The number of different sizes is simply `omega(G)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** The problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number, `omega(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices.\n\n5.  **Solution:** A graph with `n` vertices can have a clique of size at most `n`. This maximum is achieved by the *complete graph* `K_n`, where all `n` vertices are connected to each other. For `n = 128`, the graph `K_128` has a clique number of 128.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The graph `K_128` has induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 128. This gives a total of 128 different clique sizes. This is the maximum possible number.\n\nI will now provide the Python code that encapsulates this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with n vertices.\n\n    The problem is to determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n vertices.\n\n    Let G be a graph on n vertices. Let omega(G) be the clique number of G,\n    which is the size of the largest clique in G.\n    If G has a clique S of size omega(G), then the induced subgraph on S is K_{omega(G)}.\n    For any integer k where 1 <= k <= omega(G), any subset S' of S with size k\n    will also form a complete graph. Thus, G also contains an induced clique of size k.\n\n    This means the set of all possible induced clique sizes in G is {1, 2, ..., omega(G)}.\n    The number of different sizes is therefore omega(G).\n\n    To maximize this number, we need to maximize omega(G) for a graph on n vertices.\n    The maximum possible clique number for a graph on n vertices is n. This is achieved\n    by the complete graph K_n.\n\n    For n = 128, the maximum number of different clique sizes is 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the graph\n    n = 128\n\n    # The maximum number of different clique sizes is the maximum possible clique number, which is n.\n    max_sizes = n\n\n    print(f\"Given a graph with n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of different clique sizes corresponds to the maximum possible clique number of the graph.\")\n    print(\"The maximum possible clique number for a graph with n vertices is n itself, achieved by the complete graph K_n.\")\n    \n    # Printing the final equation as requested\n    final_equation_lhs = \"Maximum_Number_of_Clique_Sizes\"\n    final_equation_rhs = n\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{final_equation_lhs} = {final_equation_rhs}\")\n\nsolve_clique_sizes()\n\n```\n<<<128>>>"
