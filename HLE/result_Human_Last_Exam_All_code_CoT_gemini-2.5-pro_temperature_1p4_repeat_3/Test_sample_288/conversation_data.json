    "I will write a Python script to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Fetch the adult hermaphrodite *C. elegans* synaptic connectome dataset from a reliable online source.\n2.  Use the `pandas` library to load and process the data.\n3.  Filter the dataset to isolate all chemical synapses originating from the ASJ neurons (both ASJL and ASJR).\n4.  Group the filtered data by the target (postsynaptic) cell and sum the number of synapses for each.\n5.  Identify the target cell that receives the highest total number of synapses from ASJ.\n6.  Print the final result, clearly stating the source, the target, and the synapse count.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport io\n\ndef find_main_synaptic_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main synaptic target of a given source neuron in the C. elegans connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The URL points to the synaptic connectivity data from Cook et al.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What cell is the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans in terms of synapse number?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
