def solve_dungeon_path():
    """
    This function determines the least dangerous path from the adventurer '@' to the gold 'g'.

    The solution is derived by analyzing the map's topology and risk factors.

    1.  Map Analysis: The dungeon consists of four main areas connected by doors.
        - Top-Right: Adventurer's start.
        - Bottom-Right: Contains the Dragon 'D'.
        - Central Hallway: A network of '#' corridors.
        - Top-Left: Contains the gold 'g'.

    2.  Connectivity:
        - The adventurer's only exit is a door leading into the dragon's room.
        - The dragon room's only other exit leads to the central hallway.
        - The central hallway connects to the gold room.
        - Therefore, the high-level path is fixed: Start -> Dragon Room -> Hallway -> Gold Room.

    3.  Risk Assessment (Path within the Dragon Room):
        - The dragon 'D' is located at the bottom-right of its room.
        - To cross from the entry door to the exit door, the adventurer has two main choices:
            a) Move Left, then Down (hugging the far wall).
            b) Move Down, then Left (passing closer to the dragon).
        - Path (a) is objectively the "least dangerous" as it maintains the maximum possible distance from the dragon.

    4.  Path Construction: The final sequence of directions is built by combining the necessary directional changes for each segment of the journey.
    """

    # Segment 1: Start to Dragon Room
    # To exit the starting area, the adventurer must move down to the door.
    path_directions = ["D"]

    # Segment 2: Crossing the Dragon Room
    # The safest path is Left, then Down. This adds two new direction changes.
    path_directions.append("L")
    path_directions.append("D")

    # Segment 3: Navigating the Hallway
    # Exiting the dragon room (Left), moving up the main hallway shaft (Up),
    # and moving to the gold room's door (Left) requires three direction changes.
    # The 'L' to exit the dragon room is the first move.
    path_directions.append("L")
    # Then, move up the hallway.
    path_directions.append("U")
    # Finally, move left towards the gold room's door.
    path_directions.append("L")

    # Segment 4: Reaching the Gold
    # Entering the gold room and moving to the gold is a continuation of the last 'L'eft move.
    # No new direction is introduced.

    # Print the final path sequence.
