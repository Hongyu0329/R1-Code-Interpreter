    """
    Solves the topology problem by logical deduction.
    The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact
    topological space X with specific properties related to the long ray R.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the given properties of space X.
    # Let R be the long ray [0, omega_1).
    # Property (1): X is a compact space and contains a dense copy of R.
    # This means X is a compactification of R.
    
    # Property (2): Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique
    # continuous function on X.
    # This is a well-known universal property in topology.

    # Step 2: Identify the space X based on its properties.
    # The combination of being a compactification and satisfying the extension property
    # for all bounded continuous functions uniquely defines the Stone-Čech
    # compactification of R, denoted as βR.
    
    # Step 3: Apply the uniqueness theorem for the Stone-Čech compactification.
    # A key theorem states that the Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space
    # (which R is) is unique up to homeomorphism.
    # This means that if we have two spaces, X1 and X2, that both satisfy the
    # given properties, then there must exist a homeomorphism between them.

    # Step 4: Conclude the number of homeomorphism classes.
    # Since any two spaces satisfying the conditions are homeomorphic, they all belong
    # to the same homeomorphism class.
    # Therefore, there is only one distinct homeomorphism class.
    
    number_of_classes = 1

    # Step 5: Print the reasoning and the final answer.
    print("The properties given for the space X are the defining properties of the Stone-Čech compactification of the long ray R.")
    print("The Stone-Čech compactification of a space is unique up to homeomorphism.")
    print("This implies that all spaces X satisfying the given conditions are homeomorphic to each other.")
    print("Therefore, they all fall into a single homeomorphism class.")
    print("\nNumber of distinct homeomorphism classes is:")
    
    # Final equation: Number of classes = 1
    print(number_of_classes)
