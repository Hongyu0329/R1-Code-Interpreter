    "To determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  I will compile a list of all the instances a player has won the Triple Crown in either the American League (AL) or the National League (NL). A player wins the Triple Crown by leading their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs in the same season.\n2.  I will separate these wins by league (AL and NL) and count the number of wins for each.\n3.  I will sum the counts from both leagues to find the total number of Triple Crown *instances* in MLB history.\n4.  To find the number of unique Triple Crown *winners*, I will extract the player names from all instances and count the number of unique names.\n5.  The final code will print out this entire breakdown, showing the count for each league and the final calculation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    The function stores the data of all Triple Crown instances,\n    calculates the totals per league, the total instances, and the\n    total number of unique players who have achieved this feat.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data source: MLB, Baseball-Reference, Wikipedia\n    # Each dictionary represents a Triple Crown season win.\n    triple_crown_wins = [\n        # National League\n        {'year': 1878, 'player': 'Paul Hines', 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'year': 1894, 'player': 'Hugh Duffy', 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'year': 1922, 'player': 'Rogers Hornsby', 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'year': 1925, 'player': 'Rogers Hornsby', 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'year': 1933, 'player': 'Chuck Klein', 'league': 'NL'},\n        {'year': 1937, 'player': 'Joe Medwick', 'league': 'NL'},\n        # American League\n        {'year': 1901, 'player': 'Nap Lajoie', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1909, 'player': 'Ty Cobb', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1933, 'player': 'Jimmie Foxx', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1934, 'player': 'Lou Gehrig', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1937, 'player': 'Joe DiMaggio', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1942, 'player': 'Ted Williams', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1947, 'player': 'Ted Williams', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1956, 'player': 'Mickey Mantle', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1966, 'player': 'Frank Robinson', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 1967, 'player': 'Carl Yastrzemski', 'league': 'AL'},\n        {'year': 2012, 'player': 'Miguel Cabrera', 'league': 'AL'},\n    ]\n\n    # Separate winners by league\n    al_winners = [win for win in triple_crown_wins if win['league'] == 'AL']\n    nl_winners = [win for win in triple_crown_wins if win['league'] == 'NL']\n\n    # Get the count of wins for each league\n    num_al_wins = len(al_winners)\n    num_nl_wins = len(nl_winners)\n    \n    # Calculate total instances\n    total_instances = num_al_wins + num_nl_wins\n\n    # Get the set of unique player names to find the number of unique winners\n    unique_players = set(win['player'] for win in triple_crown_wins)\n    num_unique_winners = len(unique_players)\n\n    print(f\"Number of Triple Crown wins in the American League: {num_al_wins}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Triple Crown wins in the National League: {num_nl_wins}\")\n    print(f\"Total Triple Crown instances in MLB history: {num_al_wins} + {num_nl_wins} = {total_instances}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of unique players to win the Triple Crown is: {num_unique_winners}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
