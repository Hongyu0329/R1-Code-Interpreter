    "The task is to find the radical (bushu) for the kanji 謄 and provide its name in Hepburn romanization.\n\n1.  **Identify the Kanji:** The character is 謄.\n2.  **Decompose the Kanji:** I will look at the components of the character 謄. It is composed of a left part and a right part.\n3.  **Identify the Radical:** The radical is the part of the character used for dictionary look-up. For characters with a left-right structure, the radical is often the left-hand component. In this case, the left part is 言. This is the \"word\" or \"speech\" radical.\n4.  **Find the Radical's Name:** When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known as a \"hen\" (偏). Its specific name is ごんべん (gonben).\n5.  **Transcribe to Hepburn:** I will convert the Japanese name ごんべん into Hepburn romanization.\n    *   ご (go)\n    *   ん (n)\n    *   べん (ben)\n    *   Combined, it becomes \"Gonben\".\n6.  **Create the Python Script:** The script will simply store this name in a variable and then print it.\n\n```python\n# The Japanese character is 謄.\n# The radical (bushu) is the component on the left, which is 言.\n# When the radical 言 is on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n# The name for this specific radical form is ごんべん.\n# In Hepburn romanization, ごんべん is transcribed as \"Gonben\".\nradical_name = \"Gonben\"\nprint(radical_name)\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
