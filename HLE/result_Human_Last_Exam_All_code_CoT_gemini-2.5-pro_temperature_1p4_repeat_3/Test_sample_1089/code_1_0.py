        'C. Blade Tip Rub and Wear': 'Directly causes material loss at the blade tip due to abrasion. The repair precisely involves building up the tip with weld layers to restore original dimensions and clearance. This is a very common and routine MRO task.',
        'D. Creep Deformation': 'Is a stretching of the entire blade. It cannot be fixed by adding material to the surface.',
        'E. Fatigue Cracking': 'Similar to stress corrosion cracking, this is about repairing a crack, not restoring a large worn surface.',
