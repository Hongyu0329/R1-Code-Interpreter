    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' to locate the specific section where the names of the prophets are listed. The poem dedicates a series of verses (bayt) to enumerating twenty-five prophets. My plan is to:\n1.  Identify the starting verse where the first prophet's name appears in this detailed list.\n2.  Identify the final verse that mentions the last prophet in the list.\n3.  Write a Python script that stores these two numbers in variables and then prints a clear statement indicating the range, showing each number.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt)\n    in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The detailed list of prophets' names begins in verse 28.\n    start_bayt = 28\n\n    # The list of prophets' names concludes in verse 34.\n    end_bayt = 34\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi,\")\n    print(\"the names of the prophets are mentioned from bayt (verse) number {} to bayt number {}.\".format(start_bayt, end_bayt))\n\n# Execute the function to display the result.\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<28 - 34>>>"
