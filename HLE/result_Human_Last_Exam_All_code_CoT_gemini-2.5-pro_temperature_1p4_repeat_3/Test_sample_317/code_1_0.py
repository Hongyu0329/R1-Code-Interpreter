# The user wants to understand the classification of Kenneth Burke's "Tribal No."

# 1. Define Burke's key terms:
#    - Motion: The non-symbolic, physical realm (e.g., a falling rock). It lacks intent.
#    - Action: The symbolic realm of humans. It involves language, choice, motive, and will.
#    - The Negative: A concept (like "not" or "thou shalt not") that only exists through language. Nature has no negative.
#    - The "Tribal No": The foundational prohibitions and commandments of a society.

# 2. Analyze the "Tribal No" using these terms:
#    - The "Tribal No" is a set of "thou shalt nots."
#    - Since these are negatives, they must be linguistic/symbolic creations.
#    - Because they are symbolic, they belong to the realm of Action, not Motion. This eliminates choices B and D.

# 3. Evaluate the remaining choices:
#    - A. Action; it is imaginal.
#    - E. Action; it is rational.

#    The "Tribal No" consists of rules and concepts that are not physically present. They must be conceived of, or imagined, by a culture.
#    Creating a rule about what *is not* to be done is an act of the imagination.
#    While action can be rational, the term "imaginal" better captures the foundational, often mythic, nature of tribal taboos.
#    Therefore, the "Tribal No" is best described as being in the realm of Action because it is imaginal.

# 4. Final Answer Selection.
final_answer = 'A'
print(f"The correct option is A.")
print("The 'Tribal No' is a system of prohibitions ('thou shalt nots'), which is based on the concept of the negative.")
print("For Kenneth Burke, the negative is a purely symbolic/linguistic invention; it does not exist in the natural realm of 'motion.'")
print("The realm of symbols, language, motive, and choice is the realm of 'action.'")
print("Therefore, the 'Tribal No' is an 'action.'")
print("It is 'imaginal' because these rules are not tangible objects but are concepts created and sustained in the collective imagination of the tribe.")
