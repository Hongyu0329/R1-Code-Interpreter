    "To solve this, I will use my knowledge of poker theory, specifically Game Theory Optimal (GTO) preflop opening ranges for a 100BB No-Limit Hold'em cash game.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Scenario**: The user is asking for the weakest suited Jack hand that should be open-raised from the button position.\n2.  **Consult GTO Strategy**: For this scenario (100BB deep, button vs. blinds), GTO strategy dictates opening a very wide range of hands, approximately 45-50% of all possible starting hands.\n3.  **Analyze Suited Jacks**: I will list all suited Jack hands (JAs, JKs, ..., J2s) and determine their place in the opening range.\n4.  **Find the \"Worst\" Hand**: According to GTO solvers, stronger suited Jacks (like J7s and up) are opened 100% of the time. However, the weaker ones (J6s down to J2s) are used as \"mixed strategy\" opens, meaning they are raised a certain percentage of the time and folded the rest. A hand is part of the opening range even if it's opened at a low frequency.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The \"worst\" suited Jack you should open is the one with the lowest rank that is still part of this GTO opening range. In modern GTO solvers, J2s is included in the button's opening range (though at a low frequency) for its ability to make flushes and straight draws. Therefore, it is the weakest, or \"worst,\" suited Jack one should open.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that codifies this logic, identifies the component cards ('J' and '2'), and prints the final abbreviated hand.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB cash game\n    based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker strategy.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In poker, 'J' stands for Jack.
