    # 1. Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH): A cell goes from heterozygous (e.g., genotype Aa)
    #    to homozygous (e.g., genotype AA or aa).
    # 2. Copy-Neutral: The total number of chromosomes remains the same (e.g., diploid state is maintained).
    # 3. Fits the description: "...maintaining the gene dosage despite allele deletion".

When the two inherited chromosomes are identical (isodisomy), it results in LOH.
