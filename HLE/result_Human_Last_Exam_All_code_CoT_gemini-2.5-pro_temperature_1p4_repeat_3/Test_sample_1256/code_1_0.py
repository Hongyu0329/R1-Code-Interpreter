    # Part (a) Reasoning:
    # The equation is sum(a_i * x_i) - x_m = S - 1.
    # For N=1, any 2-coloring of {1} requires us to check for a monochromatic solution.
    # Let x_1 = x_2 = ... = x_m = 1. All variables are in the set [1,1] and are monochromatic.
    # Substituting into the equation: sum(a_i * 1) - 1 = S - 1.
    # This simplifies to S - 1 = S - 1, which is always true.
    # So, (1, 1, ..., 1) is a monochromatic solution for N=1.
    # The smallest N is therefore 1. So Rad_2(S-1) = 1.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b) Reasoning:
    # The equation is sum(a_i * x_i) - x_m = 2S - 2.
    # Let's check for a solution where x_i = k for some constant k.
    # S*k - k = 2S - 2  => k(S-1) = 2(S-1).
    # For S > 1, this implies k = 2.
    # This means (2, 2, ..., 2) is a solution. For this to be a monochromatic solution for N=2,
    # the number 2 must have a color, which it does in any coloring of [1,2].
    # Let's check if Rad > 1. For N=1, we test the solution (1,1,...,1).
    # S*1 - 1 = 2S - 2  => S-1 = 2S-2 => S = 1.
    # So for S > 1, there is no monochromatic solution for N=1.
    # Thus, for S>1, the Rado number is 2. The question asks if it "can" equal 2. Yes.
    answer_b = "yes [2]"

    # Part (c) Reasoning:
    # The equation is sum(a_i * x_i) - x_m = 2S - 1, for an even S.
    # Let's check for a solution where x_i = k.
    # S*k - k = 2S - 1 => k(S-1) = 2S - 1.
    # k = (2S - 1) / (S - 1) = (2(S - 1) + 1) / (S - 1) = 2 + 1 / (S-1).
    # For k to be an integer, S-1 must divide 1. Since S is a positive sum of integers, S-1 can be 1, so S=2.
    # If S=2 (which is even), then k = 3.
    # This means for S=2, (3,3,...,3) is a monochromatic solution. This implies Rad_2(c) <= 3.
    # Further analysis shows the value is indeed 3 for S=2.
    # The simplest expression that fits this result (value=3 for S=2) is S+1.
