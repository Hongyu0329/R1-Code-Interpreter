    # 1. The problem can be analyzed by looking at how to maximize the snail's distance
    # within the constraints. The key is to use overlapping 1-minute observation intervals.

    # 2. Consider a 1.5-minute period. We can cover it with two observers:
    #    - Observer A watches from t=0 to t=1.
    #    - Observer B watches from t=0.5 to t=1.5.
    # Let's break this 1.5-minute period into three half-minute segments. Let the distances
    # traveled in these segments be d1, d2, and d3.
    # From observer A: d1 + d2 = 1 meter.
    # From observer B: d2 + d3 = 1 meter.
    # We want to maximize the total distance D = d1 + d2 + d3.
    # To maximize D, we should make the shared component, d2, as small as possible.
    # Since distance cannot be negative, we set d2 = 0.
    # This gives d1 = 1 and d3 = 1.
    # So, the total distance in 1.5 minutes is D = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 meters.
    
    total_time = 7  # minutes
    block_time = 1.5  # minutes per optimal block
    block_distance = 2  # meters per optimal block

    # 3. We can apply this strategy repeatedly over the 7-minute interval.
    # We find how many full 1.5-minute blocks fit into 7 minutes.
    num_blocks = int(total_time / block_time)

    # 4. Calculate the distance covered in these full blocks.
    distance_from_blocks = num_blocks * block_distance

    # 5. Calculate the remaining time.
    time_in_blocks = num_blocks * block_time
    remaining_time = total_time - time_in_blocks

    # 6. For the remaining time (1 minute), the simplest covering is a single
    # observer watching that interval. This means the snail travels 1 meter.
    distance_from_remainder = int(remaining_time)

    # 7. The total maximal distance is the sum of distances from the blocks and the remainder.
    total_distance = distance_from_blocks + distance_from_remainder
    
    # Generate the parts of the final equation for printing.
    equation_parts = [str(block_distance)] * num_blocks
    if distance_from_remainder > 0:
        equation_parts.append(str(distance_from_remainder))

    print("The strategy is to use four 1.5-minute blocks, each yielding 2 meters,")
    print("followed by a final 1-minute block yielding 1 meter.")
    print("The final calculation for the maximal distance is:")
    print(f"Maximal Distance = {' + '.join(equation_parts)} = {total_distance} meters")
