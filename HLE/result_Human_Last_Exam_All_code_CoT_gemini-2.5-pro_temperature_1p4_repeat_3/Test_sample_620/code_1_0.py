    # Step 1: Define the core problem from the assay's conditions.
    # The plot of Product vs. Time is not linear.
    # The enzyme is an obligate dimer and the assay is pre-chilled on ice.
    print("Problem: A non-linear initial rate trace is observed.")
    print("Key Conditions: Enzyme is an obligate dimer, and the assay is pre-chilled on ice.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis based on the conditions.
    print("Hypothesis: The lag phase is caused by slow formation of the active enzyme.")
    print("1. Chilling the assay on ice can cause the active enzyme dimer to dissociate into inactive monomers.")
    print("2. When the assay warms up to the reaction temperature, these monomers must re-associate to form the active dimer.")
    print("3. This re-association takes time, resulting in a slow initial rate that increases as more active dimer is formed. This is called a 'lag phase'.")
    print("\n")
    
    # Step 3: Explain the chemical equilibrium involved.
    print("The equilibrium for the enzyme activation can be written as:")
    print("2 Monomer (inactive) <==> 1 Dimer (active)")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the provided answer choices based on the hypothesis and equilibrium.
    print("Evaluating the troubleshooting choices using Le Chatelier's Principle:")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("A. Increase temperature: Unpredictable. Might speed up association but could also denature the enzyme. It does not directly address the equilibrium position.")
    print("B. Decrease temperature: Incorrect. This would likely favor more dissociation into inactive monomers, making the lag worse.")
    print("C. Increase Enzyme Concentration: Correct. Increasing the total concentration of the enzyme will push the equilibrium '2 Monomer <=> 1 Dimer' to the right, favoring the formation of the active dimer and reducing the lag time.")
    print("D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration: Incorrect. This would shift the equilibrium to the left, favoring the inactive monomers and making the lag worse.")
    print("="*40)
    print("\nConclusion: The most logical step is to increase the enzyme concentration to promote the formation of the active dimer.")
