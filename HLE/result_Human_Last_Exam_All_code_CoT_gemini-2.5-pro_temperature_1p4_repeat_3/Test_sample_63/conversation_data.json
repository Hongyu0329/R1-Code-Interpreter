    "My plan is to solve this riddle by breaking down the clues and finding the person who fits all the criteria.\n\n1.  **The Vonnegut Clue:** The riddle starts with \"As Kurt Vonnegut noted...\". This is a specific reference pointing to someone Vonnegut wrote about or described.\n2.  **The \"Porcupine\" Clue:** The person is described as looking \"like a porcupine in all the pictures.\" This suggests someone with wild, spiky, or unkempt hair and/or a beard. Vonnegut famously described the composer Johannes Brahms this way, but his name doesn't fit the next clue.\n3.  **The Name Clue:** The name must be \"two words that start with the same letter.\" This is the key constraint.\n4.  **Connecting the Clues:** I will look for a person who Vonnegut admired, has a porcupine-like appearance in photos, and has an alliterative name. A strong candidate is the poet Walt Whitman. Vonnegut was a great admirer of Whitman, and photos of an older Whitman show him with a famously wild beard and hair. Most importantly, his name, **W**alt **W**hitman, fits the alliterative rule perfectly.\n\nI will now write a simple Python script to declare the first and last names and then print the full name as the solution.\n\n```python\n# The riddle asks for a man described by Kurt Vonnegut as looking like a porcupine,\n# whose name is two words starting with the same letter.\n# While Vonnegut described the composer Brahms this way, his name does not fit.\n# A more suitable answer is the poet Walt Whitman, whom Vonnegut admired,\n# and whose appearance in later life could be described as porcupine-like.\n# Crucially, his name is alliterative.\n\nfirst_word = \"Walt\"\nsecond_word = \"Whitman\"\n\n# The final answer is constructed from these two words.\nprint(first_word + \" \" + second_word)\n```\n<<<Walt Whitman>>>"
