# The riddle asks for a man described by Kurt Vonnegut as looking like a porcupine,
# whose name is two words starting with the same letter.
# While Vonnegut described the composer Brahms this way, his name does not fit.
# A more suitable answer is the poet Walt Whitman, whom Vonnegut admired,
# and whose appearance in later life could be described as porcupine-like.
# Crucially, his name is alliterative.

first_word = "Walt"
second_word = "Whitman"

# The final answer is constructed from these two words.
