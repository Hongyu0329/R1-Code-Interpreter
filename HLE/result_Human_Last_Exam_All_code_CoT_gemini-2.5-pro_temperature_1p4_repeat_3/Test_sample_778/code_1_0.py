    # The problem asks for the groupoid cardinality of the inserter Ins(F,G).
    # Let's outline the derivation of the formula for this cardinality.
    # The objects of Ins(F,G) are morphisms phi: F(*) -> G(*), which are elements of Z/mZ. So there are 'm' objects.
    # A morphism in Ins(F,G) from object phi to psi is an element x in Z/nZ such that G(x) + phi = psi + F(x).
    # This translates to bx + phi = psi + ax (mod m), or psi - phi = (b-a)x (mod m).
    
    # The automorphism group of an object phi consists of x in Z/nZ such that (b-a)x = 0 (mod m).
    # Let h(x) = (b-a)x. The size of the automorphism group is |ker(h)|.
    
    # Two objects phi and psi are in the same connected component if there exists an x such that psi - phi is in the image of h, Im(h).
    # The number of connected components is m / |Im(h)|.
    
    # The groupoid cardinality is (Number of components) / |Aut(object)|
    # = (m / |Im(h)|) / |ker(h)|
    
    # By the First Isomorphism Theorem, |Im(h)| = |Z/nZ| / |ker(h)| = n / |ker(h)|.
    
    # So, the cardinality = (m / (n / |ker(h)|)) / |ker(h)| = (m * |ker(h)| / n) / |ker(h)| = m / n.
    
    # This result holds as long as the functors F and G are well-defined, which requires
    # an = 0 (mod m) and bn = 0 (mod m).
    # Let's verify this for the given numbers.
