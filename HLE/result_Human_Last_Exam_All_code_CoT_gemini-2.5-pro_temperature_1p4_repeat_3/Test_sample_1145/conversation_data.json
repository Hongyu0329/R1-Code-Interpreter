    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this quantum mechanics problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Formula:** The probability `P` of finding a particle in a specific interval `[x1, x2]` is calculated by integrating the probability density function, `|ψ_n(x)|²`, over that interval:\n    `P = ∫[x1, x2] |ψ_n(x)|² dx`\n\n2.  **Define the Wave Function:** For a particle in a 1D box of length `a`, the normalized wave function is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n\n3.  **Determine the Probability Density:** Squaring the wave function gives the probability density:\n    `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)`\n\n4.  **Set up the Integral:** We are given `n = 2`, `x1 = 0.495a`, and `x2 = 0.505a`. The integral becomes:\n    `P = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\n5.  **Solve the Integral Analytically:** The indefinite integral of `(2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)` is `[x/a - sin(2nπx/a)/(2nπ)]`. For `n=2`, this is `[x/a - sin(4πx/a)/(4π)]`. We can evaluate this definite integral by plugging in the limits. Notice that the box length `a` cancels out, so the result is independent of it.\n\n6.  **Calculate with Python:** A Python script can perform this calculation accurately. The script will evaluate the analytical solution at the given limits and print out the steps of the calculation along with the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters for the problem\nn = 2\nx1_ratio = 0.495  # Lower bound of the interval as a fraction of a\nx2_ratio = 0.505  # Upper bound of the interval as a fraction of a\n\n# The probability P is the definite integral of |ψ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n# from x1 to x2.\n# The analytical result of this integral is [x/a - sin(2nπx/a)/(2nπ)].\n# We evaluate this from x/a = x1_ratio to x/a = x2_ratio.\n\n# Let's calculate the components of the final equation\n# For n=2, the term in the denominator is 2*n*π = 4π\ndenominator_term = 2 * n * math.pi\n\n# Value of the antiderivative at the upper bound x2\nval_at_x2 = x2_ratio - math.sin(2 * n * math.pi * x2_ratio) / denominator_term\n\n# Value of the antiderivative at the lower bound x1\nval_at_x1 = x1_ratio - math.sin(2 * n * math.pi * x1_ratio) / denominator_term\n\n# The probability is the difference\nprobability = val_at_x2 - val_at_x1\n\n# --- Output the results step-by-step ---\nprint(f\"The probability P is found by solving the definite integral of |ψ(x)|² from {x1_ratio}a to {x2_ratio}a for n={n}.\")\nprint(f\"The analytical solution to the integral is P = [x/a - sin({2*n}πx/a)/({2*n}π)] evaluated from {x1_ratio} to {x2_ratio}.\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Plugging in the numbers into the equation ---\")\n\nprint(f\"P = ( {x2_ratio} - sin({2*n}π * {x2_ratio}) / ({denominator_term:.5f}) ) - ( {x1_ratio} - sin({2*n}π * {x1_ratio}) / ({denominator_term:.5f}) )\")\nprint(f\"P = ( {val_at_x2:.8f} ) - ( {val_at_x1:.8f} )\")\nprint(f\"P = {probability:.8f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from {x1_ratio}a to {x2_ratio}a for n={n} is approximately {probability:.4e}.\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\n# print(f\"<<<{probability}>>>\")\n```\n<<<6.578e-06>>>"
