    # --- Step 1: Define Fields (as derived in the plan) ---
    # The total electric field E_total inside the rod (r <= R) is the sum of the
    # external field (E k̂) and the rod's own radial field.
    # E_total = (ρ*r / (2*ε₀)) r̂ + E k̂

    # The magnetic field B inside the rod (r <= R) is generated by the
    # moving charge (current density J = ρ*v k̂).
    # B = (μ₀*ρ*v*r / 2) φ̂

    # --- Step 2: Calculate Poynting Vector S = (1/μ₀) * E_total x B ---
    # We substitute the fields into the Poynting vector formula:
    # S = (1/μ₀) * [ ( (ρ*r / (2*ε₀)) r̂ + E k̂ ) x ( (μ₀*ρ*v*r / 2) φ̂ ) ]

    # Distribute the cross product:
    # S = (1/μ₀) * [ (ρ*r / (2*ε₀)) * (μ₀*ρ*v*r / 2) * (r̂ x φ̂) + E * (μ₀*ρ*v*r / 2) * (k̂ x φ̂) ]

    # Use the cylindrical coordinate cross products: r̂ x φ̂ = k̂ and k̂ x φ̂ = -r̂
    # S = (1/μ₀) * [ (μ₀*ρ²*v*r² / (4*ε₀)) k̂ - (μ₀*E*ρ*v*r / 2) r̂ ]

    # --- Step 3: Simplify and Print the Final Expression ---
