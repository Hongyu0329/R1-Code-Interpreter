    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Generate All Possibilities**: The first step is to generate every possible string of length 5 using the given symbols `T, F, !, &, |, (, )`. Since there are 7 symbols and the length is 5, there are 7^5 = 16,807 possible combinations. We can use Python's `itertools.product` to generate these systematically.\n2.  **Validate Each Possibility**: For each generated string, we need to check if it represents a syntactically valid boolean expression. A robust way to do this is to leverage Python's own parser.\n    *   We will transform the expression string into a format Python can understand. For example, `T` becomes `True`, `&` becomes `and`, `!` becomes `not`, and so on. This respects the required operator precedence (`not` > `and` > `or`).\n    *   We will then use a `try...except` block to attempt to `eval()` the transformed string. If `eval()` runs without raising an error (like `SyntaxError` or `TypeError`), the original string is a valid expression. We will also ensure the result is a boolean (`True` or `False`).\n3.  **Count and Categorize**: We will keep a count of all the valid expressions. To fulfill the request to \"output each number in the final equation\", we will categorize the valid expressions into two groups: those that contain parentheses and those that do not.\n4.  **Display Results**: Finally, the code will print the number of expressions in each category and the total count in the form of an addition equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of valid boolean expressions of length 5 using a given set of symbols.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    length = 5\n    \n    valid_expressions = []\n    \n    # 1. Generate all possible strings of length 5.\n    all_combinations = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=length)\n    \n    for combo in all_combinations:\n        expr_str = \"\".join(combo)\n        \n        # 2. Transform the string into a Python-evaluable format.\n        # Adding spaces around operators and literals prevents invalid concatenations.\n        py_expr = expr_str.replace('T', ' True ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('F', ' False ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('&', ' and ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('|', ' or ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('!', ' not ')\n        \n        # 3. Use eval() in a try-except block to check for syntactic validity.\n        try:\n            # An expression is valid if it can be evaluated without error\n            # and results in a boolean value.\n            result = eval(py_expr)\n            if isinstance(result, bool):\n                valid_expressions.append(expr_str)\n        except (SyntaxError, TypeError, NameError):\n            # These exceptions indicate an invalid expression format.\n            pass\n            \n    # 4. Categorize the valid expressions and print the results.\n    expr_with_parens = []\n    expr_without_parens = []\n    \n    for expr in valid_expressions:\n        if '(' in expr or ')' in expr:\n            expr_with_parens.append(expr)\n        else:\n            expr_without_parens.append(expr)\n            \n    count_with_parens = len(expr_with_parens)\n    count_without_parens = len(expr_without_parens)\n    total_count = len(valid_expressions)\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of valid boolean expressions of length 5:\")\n    print(f\"Found {count_without_parens} expressions without parentheses.\")\n    print(f\"Found {count_with_parens} expressions with parentheses.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal count expressed as an equation:\")\n    \n    # Output each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{count_without_parens} + {count_with_parens} = {total_count}\")\n\n# Run the function to get the answer.\ncount_boolean_expressions()\n<<<98>>>\n```"
