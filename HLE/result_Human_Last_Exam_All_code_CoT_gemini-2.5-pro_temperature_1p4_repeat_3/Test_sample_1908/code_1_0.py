    This function provides the solution to the topological problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a non-trivial,
    non-discrete topology T on a set X of cardinality c can have.

    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. The topology generated by T U S is the discrete topology.
    2. The intersection of T and S is the trivial topology {âˆ…, X}.

    The smallest possible number of complements can be zero. This is because there
    exist topologies that satisfy the given conditions but have no complements.
    A standard example is the density topology on the real numbers. The real line
    has cardinality c, and its density topology is neither trivial nor discrete.
    It is a known mathematical result that the density topology has no complements.

    Therefore, the minimum possible number of complements is 0.
