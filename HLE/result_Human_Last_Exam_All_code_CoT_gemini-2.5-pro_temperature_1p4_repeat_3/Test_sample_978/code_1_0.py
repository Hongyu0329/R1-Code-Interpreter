    Analyzes the provided legal scenario to determine the correct attribution of liability.

    The analysis follows these steps:
    1.  **Mark's Incident:** Mark, as an employee, was negligent within the scope of his employment.
        Both Mark (direct liability) and his employer Evergreen (vicarious liability) are responsible.
        They are jointly and severally liable for the pool damage.

    2.  **Lincoln's Incident:** Lincoln, as an employee, was also negligent within the scope of his employment.
        Both Lincoln (direct liability) and his employer Evergreen (vicarious liability) are responsible.
        They are jointly and severally liable for the damage to the car.

    3.  **Conclusion:** The two incidents are separate. Liability for each incident falls on the employee who caused it and the employer.
    """
    answer_choice = "E"
    explanation = """
    E. Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. and Mark are jointly and severally liable for the damage that resulted from Mark's actions. Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable for the damage that resulted from Lincoln's actions.
    
    This is the correct answer because:
    1. For Mark's actions, he was negligent while on the job. Under the principle of vicarious liability, his employer, Evergreen Grass Care Ltd., is also liable. They are considered jointly and severally liable for the pool-related damages.
    2. For Lincoln's actions, he was also negligent (or worse) while on the job. Similarly, Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. is vicariously liable for the damage he caused to the car. They are jointly and severally liable for the scratches.
    The two events are treated as separate incidents of negligence.
