    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that calculates the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu based on the game's mechanics and technical limitations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Base Stats:** First, I'll establish the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player.\n2.  **Determine Scaling Formula:** I'll use the multiplayer health scaling formula for Expert Mode, where each additional player increases the boss's health by a specific percentage of its base health.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The formula for health is linear, meaning mathematically, health would approach infinity as players do.\n4.  **Incorporate Source Code Limitation:** The prompt requires considering the game's source code. In Terraria, health is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int32`). This data type has a maximum value, which creates a hard cap on the boss's health, regardless of the formula.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The theoretical maximum health is therefore the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer. The script will explain this logic and print the final value as derived from this technical limit.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 3640\n    health_increase_factor = 0.35\n    \n    # Step 2: Explain the health scaling formula.\n    print(\"To find the theoretical maximum health, we first need the scaling formula for multiplayer in Expert Mode.\")\n    print(f\"The Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode is {base_health}.\")\n    print(f\"For each player after the first, its health is increased by {health_increase_factor * 100}% of its base health.\")\n    \n    health_increase_per_player = int(base_health * health_increase_factor)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe formula is: TotalHealth = BaseHealth + (HealthIncreasePerPlayer * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\")\n    print(f\"Substituting the values: TotalHealth = {base_health} + ({health_increase_per_player} * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the formula for an infinite number of players.\n    print(\"\\nThis formula is linear. As the 'NumberOfPlayers' approaches infinity, the 'TotalHealth' calculated by this formula would also approach infinity.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the limitation based on the game's source code.\n    print(\"\\nHowever, the game's source code imposes a technical limitation. A character's health (lifeMax) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    print(\"This data type has a maximum possible value, which acts as a hard cap on the boss's health, preventing it from actually becoming infinite.\")\n    \n    # Step 5: State the final calculation based on the data type limit.\n    max_value_exponent = 31\n    subtrahend = 1\n    int32_max_value = 2**max_value_exponent - subtrahend\n\n    print(\"\\nThe true theoretical maximum health is the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation for this value is:\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical Max Health = 2 ^ {max_value_exponent} - {subtrahend} = {int32_max_value:,}\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health()\n<<<2147483647>>>"
