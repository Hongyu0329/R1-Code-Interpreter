    Thinking Process:
    1. The riddle is broken into two main parts.
       Part 1: "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke, after another;"
       This describes multiple horizontal bars, like the rails of a fence.

    2. Part 2: "one vertical stroke, another vertical stroke, after another; one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right; one vertical stroke, another vertical stroke, after another."
       This describes multiple vertical bars, like the posts of a fence. The phrase "one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right" is a key clue, suggesting the outer structure of a fence or barrier.

    3. Instead of constructing a character stroke by stroke, this riddle is best interpreted as a description of a real-world object. This is a common method for Chinese character riddles (字谜).

    4. The object being described is clearly a fence, a grid, or a railing, which is constructed from horizontal rails and vertical posts.

    5. The Chinese character representing this object is '栅' (pinyin: zhà). This character's own structure supports the answer: it is composed of the radical '木' (wood) on the left and '冊' (which visually resembles a grid or bound bamboo slips) on the right. A wooden grid is a fence.
