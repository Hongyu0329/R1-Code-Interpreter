Rationale:
1.  Statement IV (Arrange a multidisciplinary consultation): This is the gold standard of care for a complex case like this. The patient's history of cancer, high-dose opioid use, and difficulty tapering requires a holistic approach. A team involving pain management and psychiatry can address the physical aspects of pain, the physiological aspects of withdrawal, and the psychological components of dependence or addiction. This is the safest and most effective way to develop a comprehensive plan.

2.  Statement V (Prescribe buprenorphine-naloxone): This is a primary, evidence-based treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Given the patient's challenges with tapering, OUD is a strong possibility. Buprenorphine-naloxone effectively manages withdrawal symptoms and cravings with a better safety profile than full agonists like methadone, particularly regarding the risk of respiratory depression. It directly and correctly answers the patient's question about whether it could be part of their plan.

Combining IV and V represents the best approach: using an expert team to guide the implementation of a modern, safe, and effective medication-assisted treatment plan.
