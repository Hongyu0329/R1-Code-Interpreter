    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the user's request. The main task is to compute the determinant of the explicitly given 3x3 matrix `A`. The information about the \"Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13\" serves as context for the origin of the matrix but is not needed for the calculation itself.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that calculates this determinant. To meet the user's requirement to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the script will display the step-by-step calculation using the standard formula for a 3x3 determinant (Sarrus's rule):\n`det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n\nThe Python script will perform the following actions:\n1.  Define the matrix `A` using the `numpy` library for easy handling.\n2.  Extract the individual elements (a, b, c, etc.) from the matrix.\n3.  Print the determinant formula.\n4.  Use f-strings to print the formula with the specific numbers from matrix `A` substituted in.\n5.  Print the intermediate steps of the calculation, showing how the terms are simplified.\n6.  Finally, print the computed value of the determinant.\n\nThis will result in a clear, easy-to-follow calculation that shows exactly how the final answer is derived.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The task is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix A.\n# The matrix is the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13.\n#\n# A = [[ 2, -1, -1],\n#      [-1,  2, -1],\n#      [-1, -1,  2]]\n#\n# We will use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n# det([[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\n# Step 1: Define the matrix using numpy.\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extract the elements to display the formula.\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the terms of the determinant formula.\n# First term: a(ei - fh)\nterm1_val = a * (e * i - f * h)\n# Second term: -b(di - fg)\nterm2_val = -b * (d * i - f * g)\n# Third term: c(dh - eg)\nterm3_val = c * (d * h - e * g)\n\n# Calculate the final determinant.\ndeterminant = term1_val + term2_val + term3_val\n\n# Step 3: Print the step-by-step calculation.\nprint(f\"The given matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nThe formula for the determinant is: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the sub-expressions (the cofactors):\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({e*i - f*h}) - ({b}) * ({d*i - f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h - e*g})\")\n\nprint(\"\\nPerforming the multiplications:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({term1_val}) + ({term2_val}) + ({term3_val})\")\n\nprint(\"\\nSumming the terms for the final result:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {determinant}\")\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
