The fermionic partition function `Z` in the imaginary time representation is expressed as a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields `ψ(x, τ)` and `ψ̄(x, τ)`. The formula is:

`Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp[-S_E]`

where `S_E` is the Euclidean action given by:

`S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ̄(x,τ) (∂_τ + H_0 - μ) ψ(x,τ)`

Here:
- `β` is the inverse temperature `1/(k_B T)`.
- `τ` is the imaginary time variable.
- `H_0` is the single-particle Hamiltonian (e.g., the kinetic energy operator).
- `μ` is the chemical potential.
- The integral `∫ Dψ̄ Dψ` denotes a functional integral over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields.
- A critical requirement for fermions is that the fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time dimension: `ψ(x, β) = -ψ(x, 0)`.
