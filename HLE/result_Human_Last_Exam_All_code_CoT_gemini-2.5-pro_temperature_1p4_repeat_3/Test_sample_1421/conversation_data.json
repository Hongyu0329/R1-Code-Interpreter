    "The task is to provide the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism. I will formulate the answer by first explaining the components of the formula and then presenting the complete formula using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Partition Function (Z):** Start from the statistical mechanics definition, `Z = Tr[exp(-βH)]`, where `β` is the inverse temperature and `H` is the Hamiltonian.\n2.  **Introduce the Path Integral:** Explain that the trace `Tr[...]` is calculated by summing over all possible field configurations (paths) in imaginary time. For fermions, these \"fields\" are represented by anticommuting numbers called Grassmann variables.\n3.  **Define the Action (S):** The contribution of each path is weighted by `exp(-S)`, where `S` is the Euclidean action of the system. The action is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian over imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β`.\n4.  **Incorporate Fermionic Statistics:** The key feature for fermions is the use of Grassmann fields (`ψ` and `ψ̄`) and the imposition of anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, i.e., `ψ(τ) = -ψ(τ + β)`. This arises from the properties of the trace operation for fermionic states.\n5.  **Assemble the Final Formula:** Combine all these elements into a single path integral expression for `Z`.\n6.  **Python Code:** Write a Python script that uses the `print()` function to display the final, formatted formula, including all its mathematical symbols.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function (Z)\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Using unicode characters for mathematical symbols for better representation.\n    # Z = Partition Function\n    # ∫ = Integral sign\n    # Dψ Dψ̄ = Functional integration measure over Grassmann fields\n    # exp = Exponential function\n    # β = 1 / (k_B * T), inverse temperature\n    # τ = Imaginary time variable\n    # x = Spatial variable\n    # ψ(x, τ), ψ̄(x, τ) = Fermionic Grassmann fields\n    # ∂_τ = Partial derivative with respect to imaginary time\n    # H₀ = Single-particle Hamiltonian (e.g., -ħ²∇²/2m)\n    # μ = Chemical potential\n\n    formula = (\n        \"\\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by the functional integral:\\n\\n\"\n        \"         ╭             β           ╮\\n\"\n        \"Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ exp│- ∫ dτ ∫ d³x  L_E(ψ̄, ψ)│\\n\"\n        \"         ╰             0           ╯\\n\"\n    )\n\n    lagrangian = (\n        \"\\nWhere the Euclidean Lagrangian density, L_E, is:\\n\\n\"\n        \"L_E(ψ̄, ψ) = ψ̄(x, τ) (∂_τ + H₀ - μ) ψ(x, τ)\\n\"\n    )\n\n    full_formula = (\n        \"\\nCombining these gives the full expression:\\n\\n\"\n        \"          ╭β           ╮\\n\"\n        \"Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ exp │-∫dτ ∫d³x  ψ̄(x, τ)(∂_τ + H₀ - μ)ψ(x, τ) │\\n\"\n        \"          ╰0           ╯\\n\"\n    )\n\n    explanation = (\n        \"\\nExplanation of the terms:\\n\"\n        \"  - Z: The partition function.\\n\"\n        \"  - ∫ Dψ̄Dψ: The functional integral over all configurations of the anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ̄ and ψ.\\n\"\n        \"  - β: Inverse temperature (β = 1/(k_B*T)).
