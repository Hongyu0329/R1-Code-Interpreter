    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nMy plan is to research the history of the Piazza della Rotonda, specifically focusing on any significant alterations or features that were removed around the mid-20th century. I will then identify the specific feature in question and present it as the answer.\n\nThe unique feature that existed in the Piazza della Rotonda until the post-WWII period (around 1950) was the public tramway. The tracks and overhead electrical lines of the tram system ran directly through the piazza, passing in front of the Pantheon. This was removed as part of a city-wide effort to modernize transportation and restore the unobstructed, classical view of historic sites.\n\n<<<The tramway (tracks and overhead electrical lines)>>>"
