    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the core ballet terminology in the question: *cambré derrière*, Vaganova method, and Balanchine method. A *cambré derrière* is a bend of the body backwards from the waist. The Vaganova and Balanchine methods are two of the world's foremost training syllabi for classical ballet, each with distinct stylistic and technical characteristics.\n\nNext, I will compare the execution of a *cambré derrière* in both methods by focusing on the provided answer choices: arm placement, hip placement, speed, degree of the bend, and head placement.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the foundational technique of the torso and hips. The Vaganova method strongly emphasizes maintaining a stable, square pelvis, with the bend initiating from the upper spine. In contrast, the Balanchine style frequently allows the hip of the supporting leg to push forward. This action changes the line of the body, creating a more extreme, dynamic shape, which is a hallmark of the Balanchine aesthetic. While other differences exist (e.g., speed and head focus), the hip placement is the most fundamental and defining technical difference in the posture itself.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will create a Python script to present the information and print the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the technical differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods\n    and determines the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    # Technical analysis of the core difference\n    analysis = (\n        \"In the Vaganova method, the cambré derrière emphasizes a pure upper back bend, \"\n        \"requiring the dancer to keep the hips square and stable over the supporting leg(s). \"\n        \"This isolates the movement and builds spinal strength and flexibility.\\n\\n\"\n        \"In the Balanchine method, to create a more dynamic and extended line, \"\n        \"the dancer is often instructed to press the hip of the supporting leg forward. \"\n        \"This changes the fundamental mechanics of the pose and is considered the most \"\n        \"defining postural difference between the two styles for this specific step.\"\n    )\n    \n    correct_answer_key = 'B'\n\n    print(\"--- Ballet Technique Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"Choices:\")\n    for key, value in choices.items():\n        print(f\"  {key}. {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Reasoning ---\")\n    print(analysis)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"While aspects like speed and head placement can also differ, the most foundational technical distinction is the '{choices[correct_answer_key]}'.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the correct answer is B.\")\n\n    # Final answer in the required format\n    print(\"\\n<<<B>>>\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n```"
