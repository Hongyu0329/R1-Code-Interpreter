# Step 1: Define the number of equivalence classes for each subspace.
# As determined by the analysis, each of the five subspaces is a homogeneous space,
# meaning that all points within it belong to a single equivalence class.

# Number of classes in the torus
num_classes_torus = 1

# Number of classes in the sphere
num_classes_sphere = 1

# Number of classes in the real line
num_classes_real_line = 1

# Number of classes in a three-point discrete space
num_classes_discrete_3 = 1

# Number of classes in a five-point discrete space
num_classes_discrete_5 = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of equivalence classes.
# Since any auto-homeomorphism of the total space X must map each subspace to itself,
# the total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of classes
# in each subspace.
total_classes = (num_classes_torus +
                 num_classes_sphere +
                 num_classes_real_line +
                 num_classes_discrete_3 +
                 num_classes_discrete_5)

# Step 3: Print the final calculation and the result.
print("The total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the classes from each space:")
