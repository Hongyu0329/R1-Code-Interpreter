    "Here's my plan to determine the thickness of the double point.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial equation:** The curve is given by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We are working over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, with the valuation $v$ normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\n2.  **Find a more suitable model:** The reduction of the given equation modulo 2 gives $z^2 = 1$, which is $(z-1)^2 = 0$ in characteristic 2. This is a non-reduced special fiber (a double line), so the model is not regular. We need to find a better model to understand the stable reduction. A standard change of variables for this situation is to let $z = 1 + 2\\eta$.\n3.  **Analyze the new model:** Substituting $z=1+2\\eta$ into the curve equation yields:\n    $(1+2\\eta)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $1 + 4\\eta + 4\\eta^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $4\\eta + 4\\eta^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n    Dividing by 2, we get a new model for the curve:\n    $2\\eta^2 + 2\\eta = x^5 + x^3$\n    This model, let's call it $\\mathcal{X}_{aff}$, is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n4.  **Examine the special fiber:** The special fiber is obtained by reducing the equation of $\\mathcal{X}_{aff}$ modulo 2:\n    $0 = x^5 + x^3 = x^3(x^2+1) = x^3(x+1)^2$ (in $\\mathbb{F}_2$).\n    This special fiber, viewed in the affine plane $\\mathbb{A}^2_{(\\eta, x)}$, consists of two vertical lines: $L_1$ defined by $x=0$ (with multiplicity 3) and $L_2$ defined by $x=1$ (with multiplicity 2). These lines are disjoint in the affine plane.\n5.  **Projectivize the model:** For the special fiber to be connected (a necessary condition for a stable curve), the components must intersect. This typically happens at infinity. Let's consider the projective model in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ with homogeneous coordinates $(X:\\eta:W)$. The homogenization of $2\\eta^2 + 2\\eta = x^5 + x^3$ is:\n    $2\\eta^2 W^3 + 2\\eta W^4 = X^5 + X^3 W^2$\n    The special fiber modulo 2 is $X^5 + X^3 W^2 = X^3(X^2+W^2) = X^3(X+W)^2 = 0$.\n    This projective special fiber consists of two lines, $C_1: X=0$ (multiplicity 3) and $C_2: X=W$ (multiplicity 2). They intersect at the point $P=(0:1:0)$.\n6.  **Analyze the singularity:** The projective model itself might be singular at this intersection point $P$. Let's check. We switch to the affine chart where $\\eta=1$ to study the point $P=(X:1:W)=(0:1:0)$, which corresponds to $(X,W)=(0,0)$ in this chart. The equation of the model in this chart is:\n    $F(X,W) = X^5 + X^3 W^2 - 2W^3 - 2W^4 = 0$.\n    The partial derivatives at $(0,0)$ are:\n    $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} (0,0) = (5X^4 + 3X^2 W^2)|_{(0,0)} = 0$\n    $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial W} (0,0) = (2X^3 W - 6W^2 - 8W^3)|_{(0,0)} = 0$\n    Since both partial derivatives are zero, the model is indeed singular at $P$.\n7.  **Find the thickness:** The stable reduction is found by resolving this singularity. The thickness of a double point in the stable reduction is a quantity that can be calculated from the local equation at the singular point. For a singularity of the form $g(x,y)=0$ where the lowest degree homogeneous part is $g_d(x,y)$ and has valuation $v(g_d)$, the resolution process gives information. Here, the term with the lowest total degree in $F(X,W)$ is $-2W^3$. Its total degree is 3. The valuation of its coefficient is $v(-2)=1$. The thickness is defined as the degree of the lowest-degree term minus one. In this case, that would be $3-1=2$. The final equation would be $3-1=2$.\n\n```python\n# The curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n# We perform a change of variables z = 1 + 2*eta.\n# (1 + 2*eta)^2 = 1 + 4*eta + 4*eta^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1\n# This simplifies to 2*eta^2 + 2*eta = x^5 + x^3.\n# The special fiber (mod 2) is x^3 * (x+1)^2 = 0.\n# In the projective plane, this is X^3 * (X+W)^2 = 0, with components C1: X=0 (mult 3) and C2: X+W=0 (mult 2).\n# They intersect at P=(0:1:0).\n# The local equation of the model at P is F(X,W) = X^5 + X^3*W^2 - 2*W^3 - 2*W^4 = 0.\n# The term of lowest total degree in F(X,W) is -2*W^3.\n# The degree of this term is 3.\n# The 2-adic valuation of its coefficient is v(-2) = 1.\n# A formula for the thickness of the resulting singularity in the stable reduction is given by the degree of this term minus 1.\ndegree_of_lowest_term = 3\nvaluation_of_coefficient = 1\n\n# The thickness is the degree of the lowest-degree part of the equation minus one.\nthickness = degree_of_lowest_term - valuation_of_coefficient\n\n# Output the equation\nprint(f\"The degree of the lowest order term is {degree_of_lowest_term}.\")\nprint(f\"The valuation of the coefficient of this term is {valuation_of_coefficient}.\")\nprint(f\"The thickness is calculated as: {degree_of_lowest_term} - {valuation_of_coefficient} = {thickness}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
