    "To solve this problem, we need to identify all prime knots with four or fewer crossings, and then determine the distinct homology cobordism elements that can be generated by performing +1 or -1 surgery on them. A homology 3-sphere created by surgery on a knot represents an element in the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **List Knots**: We will consider all prime knots with up to 4 crossings: the unknot ($0_1$), the trefoil knot ($3_1$), and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$).\n2.  **Identify Invariants**: For each knot, we need two key invariants:\n    *   The **Arf invariant**, $\\text{Arf}(K)$, which determines the Rokhlin invariant of the resulting homology sphere.\n    *   The second coefficient of the Alexander polynomial, $a_2(K) = \\Delta_K''(1)/2$. This helps determine if a homology sphere with a Rokhlin invariant of 0 is trivial in the cobordism group.\n3.  **Apply Mathematical Rules**:\n    *   An integral surgery on a knot $K$ yields a homology sphere only for surgery coefficients +1 and -1.\n    *   The resulting homology sphere, $S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)$, has a Rokhlin invariant $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$.\n    *   If $\\text{Arf}(K) = 1$, the resulting sphere represents the unique non-trivial element of order 2 in $\\Theta_3^H$ (the Poincaré sphere).\n    *   If $\\text{Arf}(K) = 0$, the sphere is homology cobordant to the standard 3-sphere (i.e., it is the trivial element) if and only if $a_2(K)=0$.\n    *   If $\\text{Arf}(K) = 0$ and $a_2(K) \\neq 0$, the +1 and -1 surgeries produce two distinct, non-trivial elements of infinite order (one is the inverse of the other).\n4.  **Count the Elements**: We will use a set to keep track of the unique elements found and then report the total count.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements from knots\n    with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Knot data: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:\n    # (Knot Name, Arf Invariant, a2 Invariant)\n    # a2 is the second coefficient of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, Delta''(1)/2.\n    knots = [\n        (\"Unknot (0_1)\", 0, 0),\n        (\"Trefoil knot (3_1)\", 1, 1),\n        (\"Figure-eight knot (4_1)\", 0, 1),\n    ]\n\n    # Use a set to store unique element descriptions to avoid duplicates.\n    unique_elements = set()\n    element_counts = collections.defaultdict(int)\n\n    print(\"Analyzing integral surgeries on knots up to 4 crossings:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for name, arf, a2 in knots:\n        print(f\"Processing {name}: Arf={arf}, a2={a2}\")\n        if arf == 1:\n            # An Arf invariant of 1 corresponds to the unique order-2 element\n            # in the homology cobordism group (the Poincaré homology sphere).\n            # Both +1 and -1 surgeries on the trefoil (and its mirror) yield this element.\n            element_desc = \"The non-trivial element of order 2 (from Trefoil knot)\"\n            if element_desc not in unique_elements:\n                unique_elements.add(element_desc)\n                element_counts[\"trefoil\"] = 1\n            print(\" -> Result: A non-trivial element of order 2 (Rokhlin invariant 1).\\n\")\n        elif arf == 0:\n            if a2 == 0:\n                # Arf=0 and a2=0 means the surgery results in a manifold homology\n                # cobordant to S^3, the trivial element.\n                element_desc = \"The trivial element (from Unknot)\"\n                if element_desc not in unique_elements:\n                    unique_elements.add(element_desc)\n                    element_counts[\"unknot\"] = 1\n                print(\" -> Result: The trivial element.\\n\")\n            else: # a2 != 0\n                # Arf=0 and a2!=0 means the surgery results in non-trivial elements\n                # of infinite order.
