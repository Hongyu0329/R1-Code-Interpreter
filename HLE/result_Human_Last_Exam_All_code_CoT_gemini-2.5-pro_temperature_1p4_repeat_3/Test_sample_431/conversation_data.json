    "To determine the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 receptor, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Protein and Sequence:** I will use the canonical amino acid sequence for the human GABAAρ1 receptor subunit, which can be found in the UniProt database under the accession number **P24046**.\n2.  **Define the TM3-TM4 Linker Domain:** Based on the annotations in UniProt for P24046, the third transmembrane domain (TM3) ends at position 320, and the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) begins at position 432. The linker is the large intracellular loop connecting these two domains, spanning from residue 321 to 431.\n3.  **Extract and Analyze:** I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Store the full protein sequence.\n    *   Slice the sequence to extract the TM3-TM4 linker region (residues 321-431).\n    *   Count the number of Cysteine ('C') characters within this extracted linker sequence.\n    *   Print the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_cysteines_in_linker():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker\n    of the human GABAArho1 (GABRR1) receptor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The full amino acid sequence for human GABRR1 from UniProt (P24046).\n    full_sequence = (\n        \"MGFALALAPPLLLASMASASALPGSRLGQDDRLRRCSAVEEPGDRASQSGPGLQDSNLSFN\"\n        \"GPVLVSSEIDLNTELGLQTVTVNVYFPQLLRMGYLQLLMMFVEHSLVHWLPLDLASYNESSP\"\n        \"PEAAARRRAPQQRRVAYATAMDWFIAVCYAFVFSALIEFATVNYFTKRGYAWDGKSVVPEPK\"\n        \"KVKDPLIKKNMTPYQKAMFIDFIIKAFWVNYFLGKRSGLPINLTLDSKMESIKSYESEVPVL\"\n        \"GDFVPMDVLVCSLMMGLELLNAEAVGVQKKLDELSKQKNELYTGTFYLNYMLWIVANMPL\"\n        \"ESISSKALEEIYKYEKKDKESKKESKKKEKTKTDGIMNKGPLYIWRQCRFHLVLRVANYH\"\n        \"HGNISSCMMASIFSRAPSSYLITIVYFYFVSSVLSLSAAVVALGVYKLYIQYFFPNKEKTE\"\n        \"KKAEPAQIKKIVSKE\"\n    )\n\n    # According to UniProt annotations for P24046:\n    # - TM3 domain ends at residue 320.\n    # - TM4 domain starts at residue 432.\n    # Therefore, the TM3-TM4 linker spans from residue 321 to 431.\n    \n    # We use 0-based indexing for Python slicing.\n    # Start of linker: residue 321 is at index 320.\n    # End of linker: residue 431 is at index 430.
