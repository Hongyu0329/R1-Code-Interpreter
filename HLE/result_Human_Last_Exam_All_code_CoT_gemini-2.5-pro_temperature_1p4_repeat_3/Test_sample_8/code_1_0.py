    Calculates the resulting conormal space for R(sigma)f.

    The problem states that f is in A^(2+alpha)(X). The operator is the 
    resolvent R(sigma) = (Box_g - sigma^2)^(-1).

    The wave operator Box_g is a second-order differential operator.
    Therefore, its inverse, the resolvent R(sigma), is a pseudodifferential
    operator of order -2.

    Applying a pseudodifferential operator of order 'm' to a function in a 
    conormal space A^s(X) results in a function in the space A^(s-m)(X).

    Here, the initial order s = 2 + alpha and the operator order m = -2.
    The new order is (2 + alpha) - (-2) = 4 + alpha.
