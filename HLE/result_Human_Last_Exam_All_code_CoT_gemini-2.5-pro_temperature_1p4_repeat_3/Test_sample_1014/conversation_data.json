    "Of course. To find the largest prime divisor of a number, we can use a method called prime factorization through trial division.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  I will write a script to test for divisibility by the smallest prime number, 2. Since the number is odd, we can skip this.\n3.  Then, I'll iterate through odd numbers (3, 5, 7, and so on) up to the square root of `n`.\n4.  For each number `i` in this sequence, I'll check if it divides `n`. If it does, `i` is a prime factor. I will divide `n` by `i` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible.\n5.  If, after this process, the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining value is itself a prime number and is the largest prime factor. If no factors are found throughout the process, the original number is prime.\n6.  The script will collect all prime factors, display the full prime factorization equation, and then identify and print the largest prime factor.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the prime factors of a number, prints the factorization, \n    and determines the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_num = num\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor of 2. This part won't run for 8139881.\n    while num % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        num //= 2\n\n    # Iterate through odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of the remaining number.\n    i = 3\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the current number.\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(num))\n    while i <= limit:\n        # If i is a factor, divide num by it repeatedly.\n        if num % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            num //= i\n            # Update the limit since num has changed.\n            limit = int(math.sqrt(num))\n        else:\n            i += 2\n\n    # If the number remaining is greater than 1, it must be a prime factor itself.\n    # This is also how we handle the case where the original number is prime.\n    if num > 1:\n        factors.append(int(num))\n\n    # --- Output Section ---\n    \n    # If the list of factors contains only the number itself, it's prime.\n    if len(factors) == 1:\n        print(f\"{original_num} is a prime number.\")\n        largest_prime = original_num\n    else:\n        # Construct and print the factorization equation as requested.\n        equation_str = \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n        print(f\"{original_num} = {equation_str}\")\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {original_num} is: {largest_prime}\")\n    return largest_prime\n\n# The number to analyze\nnumber_to_analyze = 8139881\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_analyze)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
