    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of side-facing stickers on the last layer that must be observed to uniquely distinguish between all 21 possible Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the minimum information required.** The task is to find the smallest number of stickers that must be seen to get enough information to identify the cube's state from the 21 possibilities.\n2.  **Test a low number (3 stickers).** A common way to recognize a PLL is by looking at the pattern on one face. The side of the top layer on one face consists of 3 stickers (one edge, two corners). We will check if observing these 3 stickers is always enough.\n3.  **Identify ambiguity.** We will show that for certain patterns, like a solid \"bar\" of color on one face, multiple PLL cases are possible. This proves that 3 stickers are not sufficient.\n4.  **Increase the number of stickers.** Since 3 is not enough, we'll see if one more sticker (for a total of 4) can resolve the ambiguity. We'll examine cases like U-perms, A-perms, and G-perms, which are often hard to distinguish.\n5.  **Formulate the conclusion in a Python script.** The script will walk through the logic of the calculation and print the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below follows this logic to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed\n    to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Consider the number of stickers on a single face's last layer.\n    # These are the two corner side-stickers and one edge side-sticker.\n    stickers_on_one_face = 3\n\n    # Step 2: Determine if this is sufficient.\n    # A common recognition pattern is a \"bar\", where all 3 stickers on one face\n    # have the same color.
