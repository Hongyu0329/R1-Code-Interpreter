    "The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, we need to identify the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron. The outer-hull, or convex hull, of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The vertices of the great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n2.  Next, we need to find the number of triangles on the surface of this regular icosahedron. Since a regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron, all its faces are visible from the outside. The faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles, so the number of triangles needed for the triangulation is simply the number of faces it has.\n3.  We can calculate the number of faces (F) using Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states: `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n4.  A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices (V = 12) and 30 edges (E = 30).\n5.  By rearranging Euler's formula, we can solve for F: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The outer-hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# We use Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) to find the number of faces (F).\n\n# A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices.\nV = 12\n# A regular icosahedron has 30 edges.\nE = 30\n\n# Calculate the number of faces (F) using the formula F = 2 - V + E.\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nprint(f\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"A regular icosahedron has V = {V} vertices and E = {E} edges.\")\nprint(f\"Using Euler's formula V - E + F = 2:\")\nprint(f\"{V} - {E} + F = 2\")\nprint(f\"Solving for F: F = 2 - {V} + {E}\")\nprint(f\"F = {F}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe number of visible triangles is {F}.\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
