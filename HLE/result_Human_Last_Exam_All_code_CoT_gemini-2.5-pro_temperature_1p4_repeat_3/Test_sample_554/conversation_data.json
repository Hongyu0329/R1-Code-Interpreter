    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we first need to identify the chemical structure of a standard nanocar. The most widely recognized nanocar, developed by the research group of James Tour, has a chemical formula of C136H96.\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" in chemistry means that all the hydrogen atoms in an organic compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nTherefore, to find the formula for a \"perfluoronanocar,\" we would take the original formula (C136H96) and replace all 96 hydrogen (H) atoms with 96 fluorine (F) atoms. This results in a new chemical formula of C136F96.\n\nThe script below will calculate and state this based on the number of hydrogens in the original molecule.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n    The calculation is based on the chemical formula of the most common nanocar (C136H96),\n    where the prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical formula for the base nanocar is C136H96.\n    num_hydrogens = 96\n    num_carbons = 136\n\n    # In a perfluorinated compound, every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.\n    num_fluorines = num_hydrogens\n\n    print(f\"The chemical formula of the original nanocar is C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}.\")\n    print(\"In a perfluoronanocar, all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms would be equal to the number of original hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(f\"The resulting chemical formula is C{num_carbons}F{num_fluorines}.\")\n    print(f\"Total number of fluorine atoms = {num_fluorines}\")\n\ncalculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar()\n```\n<<<96>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
