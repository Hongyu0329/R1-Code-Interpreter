    print("1. Key Patient Data Points:")
    print(f" - Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c): {glycated_hemoglobin}%")
    print(f" - Time Elapsed Since Accident: {time_since_accident} hours")
    print(f" - Skeletal Finding (SNB Angle): {snb_angle} degrees")
    print("\n")

    print("2. Management Considerations Based on Data:")
    print("   a. Systemic Health:")
    print(f"   - The HbA1c level of {glycated_hemoglobin}% indicates uncontrolled diabetes. This is a primary concern as it impairs wound healing, increases the risk of infection, and can affect the long-term success of any dental prosthesis. Management must begin with medical consultation to control blood sugar levels.")
    print("   - The patient's obesity is another systemic factor that a clinical team would need to consider, especially for sedation or surgical procedures.")
    print("\n")

    print("   b. Acute Trauma Management:")
    print(f"   - With {time_since_accident} hours having passed, the priority is managing potential infection of the open tooth sockets and surrounding soft tissues. This involves cleaning (debridement) of the wounds and possibly a course of antibiotics, especially given the patient's diabetic status.")
    print("\n")

    print("   c. Dental and Skeletal Factors:")
    print(f"   - An SNB angle of {snb_angle} degrees (normal is ~80Â°) suggests a prognathic mandible (mandibular prognathism), often associated with a Class III skeletal relationship. This is a critical factor for the prosthodontist when designing a replacement, as it affects the bite (occlusion) and aesthetics.")
    print("\n")

    print("3. Cells of Interest:")
    print("   - In the context of healing and infection, the key cells are:")
    print("     - Immune Cells (Neutrophils, Macrophages): To fight off infection in the wounds.")
    print("     - Platelets: For initial clot formation.")
    print("     - Fibroblasts: For rebuilding soft tissue.")
    print("     - Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts: For remodeling the alveolar bone where the teeth were lost. The function of all these cells can be compromised by uncontrolled diabetes.")
    print("\n")

    print("4. Prosthetic (Denture) Considerations (Hypothetical):")
    print("   - Type: Given the uncontrolled diabetes and recent trauma, a conservative and non-invasive option is often preferred initially. A removable partial denture (RPD) would be a likely choice.")
    print("   - Material: An acrylic RPD is often used as a transitional or immediate denture because it is cost-effective and easily adjustable. A more permanent solution might involve a cast metal framework (e.g., Cobalt-Chromium) for better durability and fit.")
    print("   - Abutment Teeth: For replacing the left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar, the abutment teeth (teeth that support the denture) would likely be the left central incisor and the left second premolar. Their health and stability would need to be carefully assessed via x-rays and clinical examination before making a final decision.")
