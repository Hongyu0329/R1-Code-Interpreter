    Calculates the exact value of l(n, b).
    
    The derivation shows that the value of l(n, b) is a constant, independent of n and b.
    We calculate this constant by taking the limit b -> 0.
    In this limit, S_inv approaches the identity matrix I.
    The formula for l(n,b) becomes:
    l(n,b) = 2 * sum_{p=1 to n} Tr(C_p)
    
    We found that in this limit:
    Tr(C_1) = 2
    Tr(C_p) = 0 for p > 1
    
    Therefore, the sum is 2.
    l(n,b) = 2 * 2 = 4.
