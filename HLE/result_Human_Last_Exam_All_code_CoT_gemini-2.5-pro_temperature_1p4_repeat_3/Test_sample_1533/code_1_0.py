# The problem asks for the ratio BM/MI in terms of the side lengths a, b, and c.
# Based on the geometric derivation, the final expression for this ratio is (a + c) / b.
# The following code prints this symbolic expression as requested.
# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation!".
# We will represent the side lengths with strings 'a', 'b', 'c' and print each component.

a = 'a'
b = 'b'
c = 'c'

print("The derived expression for the ratio BM/MI is:")
print("(", end="")
print(a, end="")
print(" + ", end="")
print(c, end="")
print(")", end="")
print(" / ", end="")
print(b)
