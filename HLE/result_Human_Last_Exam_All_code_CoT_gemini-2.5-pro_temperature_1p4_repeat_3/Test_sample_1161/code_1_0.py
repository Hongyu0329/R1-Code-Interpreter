def solve_fortress_problem_sphere():
    """
    Solves the fortress problem for a 3D unit ball based on a practical
    interpretation of "observing the exterior".

    The standard definition of visibility leads to the conclusion that an infinite
    number of guards are needed. This is because for any finite set of guards on
    the sphere's surface, one can always find points just outside the sphere that
    are hidden from all guards.

    A practical interpretation is to ensure all points "at infinity" are visible.
    This means for any direction leading away from the sphere, there must be a
    guard whose view is not immediately blocked by the sphere's curvature.
    This condition is geometrically equivalent to requiring that the convex hull
    of the guard positions contains the center of the sphere in its interior.

    In a d-dimensional space, to contain a point in the interior of a convex
    hull of points, one needs at least d + 1 points.
