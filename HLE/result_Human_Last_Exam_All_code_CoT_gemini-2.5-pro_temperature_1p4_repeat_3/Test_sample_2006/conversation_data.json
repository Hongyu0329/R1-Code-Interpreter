    "This riddle can be solved by translating the haiku's lines into a mathematical equation and then finding the number base in which this equation holds true. The title, \"The Bays,\" is a pun for \"The Base.\"\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Decode the numbers and operator:**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\": This line gives us the number `2 * 15 = 30` and suggests an operation of subtraction (\"winds of change\").\n    *   \"An August tempest\": \"An\" suggests the digit `1`, and \"August\" (the 8th month) suggests the digit `8`. Together, they form the number `18`.\n    *   \"A divine one yields\": This gives us the result of the equation, which is `1`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the equation:** The structure of the haiku suggests an equation. The most consistent interpretation is that the terms given as plain numbers or calculations are in our standard base 10, while the poetically described number is in the unknown base `b`. This leads to the equation:\n    `30 (base 10) - 18 (base b) = 1 (base 10)`\n\n3.  **Solve for the base `b`:**\n    *   First, we convert `18 (base b)` into its base 10 equivalent: `1 * b¹ + 8 * b⁰ = b + 8`.\n    *   Now, substitute this into the equation: `30 - (b + 8) = 1`.\n    *   Solving for `b`:\n        *   `30 - b - 8 = 1`\n        *   `22 - b = 1`\n        *   `b = 21`\n\n4.  **Find the final answer:** The base is 21. The question asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order.\" The 21st letter of the alphabet is U.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates finding this solution programmatically and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle presented in the haiku by setting up and solving an equation for an unknown number base.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

This is treated as a base-10 number.\n    result = 1\n    # \"An August\" gives the digits 1 and 8. This number is in the unknown base 'b'.\n    # For '18' to be a valid number in base 'b', 'b' must be greater than 8.\n    \n    found_base = None\n    # 2. We search for a base 'b' that satisfies the equation:\n    #    30 (base 10) - 18 (base b) = 1 (base 10)\n    # Start the search for b from 9, as the digit 8 must be valid.\n    for b in range(9, 100):\n        # The value of '18' in base 'b' is (1 * b + 8) in base 10.\n        val_in_base_10 = 1 * b + 8\n        if num_a - val_in_base_10 == result:\n            found_base = b\n            break\n            \n    if found_base:\n        # 3. We found the base. Now, present the equation and the answer.\n        print(\"The haiku describes a mathematical puzzle to find a number base ('The Bays').\")\n        print(\"The equation is derived as: 30 (base 10) - 18 (base b) = 1 (base 10)\")\n        print(f\"\\nSolving for 'b' yields the base: {found_base}\")\n        \n        val_of_18_in_base_b = 1 * found_base + 8\n        \n        print(\"\\nThe final equation, with all numbers converted to base 10, is:\")\n        # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n        print(f\"{num_a} - {val_of_18_in_base_b} = {result}\")\n\n        # 4.
