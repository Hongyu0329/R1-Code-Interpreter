    Calculates the global labeling number for the graph K_{1,100}.

    The problem of finding the global labeling number for K_{1,n} reduces to finding
    the smallest integer k such that there exists a set of n distinct positive integer
    labels F = {f_1, ..., f_n} from {1, ..., k} where for any element f_j in F,
    f_j cannot be written as the sum of elements of any subset of F \\ {f_j}.

    A simple construction for such a set F for n >= 2 is the set of consecutive
    integers F = {n-1, n, ..., 2n-2}.
    Let's verify this set for n=100. The set is F = {99, 100, ..., 198}.
    - The set has 100 distinct positive integers.
    - The maximum element is 198.
    - Take any element x from F. We must check that it is not a sum of other elements from F.
      The smallest possible sum of two distinct elements from F is 99 + 100 = 199.
      Since any element x in F is at most 198, x cannot be the sum of two or more
      elements from F. As all elements are distinct, x cannot be a sum of a single
      element either. Thus, this set is valid.

    This construction gives an upper bound for the global labeling number, k <= 2n-2.
    This bound is conjectured to be the minimum possible value.

    For n = 100, we calculate the global labeling number k.
