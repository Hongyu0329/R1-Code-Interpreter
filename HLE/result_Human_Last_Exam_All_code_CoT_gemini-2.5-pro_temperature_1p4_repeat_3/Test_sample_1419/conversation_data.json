    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the leading-order expression for the fixed point coupling in `ϕ⁴` theory, followed by the Python code to present the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The problem concerns the `ϕ⁴` quantum field theory near four spacetime dimensions. This is a classic application of the Renormalization Group (RG). The deviation from four dimensions is parameterized by `ϵ = 4 - d`, where `d` is the number of dimensions.\n2.  **Use the Beta Function:** A fixed point `u*` of a coupling `u` is a value where the theory becomes scale-invariant. This occurs when the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale, is equal to zero.\n3.  **State the Beta Function:** For the `ϕ⁴` theory with a Lagrangian term `(u/4!)ϕ⁴`, the one-loop beta function in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions is given by:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + 3u² / (16π²) + O(u³)`\n4.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** We need to solve the equation `β(u*) = 0` for `u*`.\n    ` -ϵu* + 3(u*)² / (16π²) = 0 `\n    This equation has two solutions. One is the trivial `u* = 0` (the Gaussian fixed point). The other, non-trivial solution is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which we find by assuming `u* ≠ 0` and simplifying the equation:\n    ` 3u* / (16π²) = ϵ `\n    Solving for `u*` gives the leading order expression.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will use the `sympy` library to represent the mathematical constants and variables and will print the final equation in a clear format, showing all the numerical components as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# --- Plan Summary ---\n# We are finding the Wilson-Fisher fixed point for phi^4 theory.\n# This requires solving the equation for the one-loop beta function, beta(u*) = 0.\n# The beta function is: beta(u) = -epsilon*u + (3*u^2)/(16*pi^2).\n# We solve for the non-trivial fixed point u*.\n\n# Define symbolic variables for the equation\nu_star, epsilon = sympy.symbols('u^* epsilon')\n\n# Set up the equation beta(u*) = 0, assuming u* is not zero\n# -epsilon + 3*u* / (16*pi**2) = 0\nequation = sympy.Eq(-epsilon + 3 * u_star / (16 * sympy.pi**2), 0)\n\n# Solve for u*\nfixed_point_solution = sympy.solve(equation, u_star)[0]\n\n# --- Final Expression ---\n# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# The expression is u* = (16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon.\n# We will print this expression in a formatted string.\nnumerator_val = 16\nexponent_val = 2\ndenominator_val = 3\n\nprint(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u^* in the phi^4 theory is:\")\nprint(f\"u^* = ({numerator_val} * \\u03c0^{exponent_val} / {denominator_val}) * \\u03f5\")\n\n```\n<<<(16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
