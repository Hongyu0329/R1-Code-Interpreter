def solve_graph_process():
    """
    This function analyzes the vertex removal process and provides the complexity bounds.
    The analysis shows that the number of steps S is tightly bound by the initial maximum degree Δ.
    Upper Bound: S <= Δ, because the maximum degree in the graph decreases by at least 1 in each step.
    Lower Bound: We can construct a tree where S = Θ(Δ), as long as n = Ω(Δ^2).

    This leads to the following case analysis:
    """

    # Case 1: Forest with maximum degree Δ <= sqrt(log n)
    # The number of steps S = Θ(Δ) = Θ(sqrt(log n)).

    # sqrt(log n) is ω(2^sqrt(log log n)) but O((log n)^0.9).
