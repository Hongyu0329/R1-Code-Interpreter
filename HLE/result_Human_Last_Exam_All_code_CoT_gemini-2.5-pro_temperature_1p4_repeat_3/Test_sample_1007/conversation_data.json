    "To determine which ballet step has the same starting and ending leg position, we need to analyze the movement of each step. I will write a Python script to outline the properties of each step and identify the correct one.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Create a data structure (a dictionary) to store information about each ballet step from the answer choices. This information will include the name of the step and a boolean value indicating whether the leg position changes from start to finish.\n2.  Iterate through this data structure to analyze each step.\n3.  An **Entrechat six** is a jump with six crossings where the legs return to their original fifth position.\n4.  An **Échappé battu changé** explicitly \"changes\" (changé) the feet.\n5.  An **Assemblé** is a jump that assembles the legs, and common forms like *dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under) change the front foot.\n6.  A **Glissade derrière** involves the front foot closing to the \"back\" (derrière), which changes the front foot.\n7.  A **Gargouillade** is a complex jump that results in the feet swapping their front/back orientation.\n8.  The script will identify the step that does not change position and print a clear explanation along with the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position as it started.\n    \"\"\"\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'description': 'A jump with an even number of crossings (six).
