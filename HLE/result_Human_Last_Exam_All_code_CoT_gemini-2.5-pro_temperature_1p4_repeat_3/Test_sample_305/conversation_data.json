    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a problem that can be solved by iterating through all possibilities and checking if they satisfy the given conditions.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent the Operation**: A binary operation on a set with 3 elements (let's use `{0, 1, 2}`) can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table, often called a Cayley table. The entry at row `i` and column `j` represents the result of `i * j`.\n\n2.  **Handle Commutativity**: The condition that the operation is commutative (`a * b = b * a`) means the Cayley table must be symmetric about its main diagonal. This simplifies our search space significantly. Instead of defining all $3 \\times 3 = 9$ entries, we only need to define the 6 entries on and above the main diagonal. The total number of such commutative operations is $3^6 = 729$.\n\n3.  **Iterate and Check Associativity**: The core of the solution is to iterate through all 729 of these possible commutative operations. For each one, we must check if it is also associative. An operation is associative if `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)` for all `a, b, c` in the set. For a set of 3 elements, this means we must verify the condition for all $3^3 = 27$ possible triplets of `(a, b, c)`.\n\n4.  **Count and Output**: A counter will track the number of operations that pass the associativity check. The script will print the logic of the calculation and the final count.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport sys\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of 3 elements by using a brute-force check.\n    \"\"\"\n    set_size = 3\n    elements = list(range(set_size))\n\n    # For a commutative operation, the Cayley table is symmetric.\n    # We only need to define the elements on and above the main diagonal.\n    # The number of these elements for a set of size n is n*(n+1)/2.\n    num_defining_entries = set_size * (set_size + 1) // 2\n\n    # The total number of commutative operations is n^(n*(n+1)/2).\n    num_commutative_ops = set_size ** num_defining_entries\n\n    print(f\"Let S be a set with {set_size} elements, e.g., S = {{0, 1, 2}}.\")\n    print(\"We need to find the number of binary operations '*' on S that are both:\")\n    print(\"1.
