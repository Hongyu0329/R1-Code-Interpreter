    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  A fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. In this problem, the function is $h(x) = f(g(x))$, so we are looking for the number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n2.  I will first determine the nature of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Since $f$ and $g$ are polynomials, their composition $f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. The number of roots of a polynomial is at most its degree. I will calculate the degree of $f(g(x)) - x$. This gives an upper bound for the number of fixed points.\n3.  Next, I must consider the constraints that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. These conditions mean both functions are strictly increasing. The composition of two strictly increasing functions is also strictly increasing.\n4.  To determine if the maximum number of roots is achievable, I will use Rolle's Theorem. If a function $H(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, its derivative $H'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n5.  I will analyze the derivative of $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$, which is $H'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$. The number of fixed points is at most (number of real roots of $H'(x)$) + 1.\n6.  I will determine the maximum possible number of real roots for $H'(x)$. This involves finding the degree of the polynomial $f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n7.  Finally, I will argue that it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy all the conditions and achieve this maximum number. I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to demonstrate the degrees of the polynomials involved and to walk through the logical steps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_fixed_points_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses symbolic mathematics to determine the maximum number\n    of fixed points for f(g(x)) given the properties of f and g.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
