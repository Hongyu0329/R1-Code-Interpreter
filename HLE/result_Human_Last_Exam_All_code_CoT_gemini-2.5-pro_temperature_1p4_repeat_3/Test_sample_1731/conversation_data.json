    "This problem involves finding the equilibrium properties of a photon gas. In the language of large deviation theory, the equilibrium state is the \"most probable\" macroscopic state, the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function. In statistical mechanics, this is equivalent to maximizing the entropy for a given set of constraints.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Connection**: I will start by explaining the connection between the user's prompt (Boltzmann-Sanov theorem) and the standard method used in physics. Maximizing the Boltzmann entropy `S = k * ln(W)` (where W is the number of microstates) is the physical analogue of finding the distribution that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is the rate function in Sanov's theorem. The equilibrium state is the one for which the probability of deviation is lowest.\n\n2.  **Entropy Maximization**: I will set up the expression for the entropy of a gas of bosons (light quanta). The key constraints for a photon gas are:\n    *   The total energy `E = Σ n_i * ε_i` is constant.\n    *   The total number of photons `N = Σ n_i` is *not* constant, which implies the chemical potential is zero.\n\n3.  **Derivation of Equilibrium Distribution**: Using the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the entropy subject to the energy constraint, I will derive the equilibrium occupation number `<n_i>` for an energy level `ε_i`. This result is the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n\n4.  **From Discrete to Continuous**: For a realistic system like black-body radiation, I will shift from a sum over discrete energy levels to an integral over a continuous spectrum using the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D volume.\n\n5.  **Final Formulas**: I will then use this framework to derive the final integrated formulas for the mean energy density (`U/V`) and the entropy density (`S/V`) as a function of temperature `T`.\n\n6.  **Python Implementation**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines the necessary physical constants.\n    *   Calculates the numerical coefficient in the equations for energy and entropy density.\n    *   Prints the final equations in a clear format.\n    *   Calculates a numerical example using the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is an excellent real-world example of a photon gas.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants in SI units\nk_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nh = 6.62607015e-34   # Planck constant (J*s)\nc = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light (m/s)\nPI = np.pi\n\n# --- Theory and Derivation Summary ---\n# The equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the most probable macrostate.\n# In large deviation theory (via the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem), this is the state\n# whose empirical distribution minimizes the rate function (relative entropy).\n# In physics, this is achieved by maximizing the Boltzmann entropy S = k * ln(W),\n# where W is the number of microstates, subject to physical constraints.\n#\n# For a gas of photons (bosons with zero chemical potential), maximizing the entropy\n# subject to a fixed total energy leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution.\n#\n# By integrating this distribution over the continuous density of states for photons\n# in a volume V, we can find the total equilibrium energy U and entropy S.\n# These derivations result in the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy and a\n# related law for entropy.\n\n# 1.
