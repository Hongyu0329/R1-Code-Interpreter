    "Of course. My plan is to first determine the answer to your movie trivia question. Then, as you requested, I will write a simple Python script that stores this information in a variable and prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know which US city the character Tommaso moves to in the movie \"Ovosodo\".\n# I will store the information in variables and print a descriptive sentence.\n\nmovie_title = \"Ovosodo\"\ncharacter_name = \"Tommaso\"\nus_city = \"Philadelphia\"\n\nprint(f\"In the 1997 movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} moves to the US city of {us_city}.\")\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In the 1997 movie Ovosodo (Hard Boiled Egg), Tommaso – played by Marco Cocci – moves to the United States.
