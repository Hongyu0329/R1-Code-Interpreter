# This script calculates the coefficients for the number of closed tree-like walks of length 6.

# A closed walk of length 6 is "tree-like" if the set of unique edges it traverses forms a tree.
# For a closed walk on a tree, every edge must be traversed an even number of times.
# The total length of the walk is 6. We analyze the possible underlying tree structures.

# 1. The tree is a single edge (K_2), traversed 6 times.
# For an edge {u, v}, the only possible walks are u-v-u-v-u-v-u and v-u-v-u-v-u-v.
# This gives 2 walks per edge. The total contribution is 2 * e.
# So, c_1 = 2.
c1 = 2

# 2. The walk's edges form a non-tree structure, such as a triangle (K_3).
# By definition, such a walk is not tree-like. Therefore, the number of K_3 subgraphs
# in X has no direct contribution to the count of tree-like walks.
# The number of tree-like walks is independent of the number of triangles.
# So, c_2 = 0.
c2 = 0

# 3. The tree is a path of length 3 (P_4), with its 3 edges each traversed twice.
# Let the path be a-b-c-d. Through combinatorial counting, we find there are:
# - 1 walk starting and ending at 'a' (a->b->c->d->c->b->a).
# - 1 walk starting and ending at 'd'.
# - 2 walks starting and ending at 'b' (excursions to 'a' and 'd' in two different orders).
# - 2 walks starting and ending at 'c'.
# Total walks per P_4 subgraph = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.
# This contributes 6 * p.
# So, c_3 = 6.
c3 = 6

# 4. The tree is a path of length 2 (P_3), with one edge traversed twice and the other four times.
# Let the path be u-v-w. Edges are e1={u,v}, e2={v,w}.
# Case a: e1 traversed 4 times, e2 twice. Walks start/end at u(2), v(3), w(1). Total 6.
# Case b: e1 traversed 2 times, e2 four times. Walks start/end at u(1), v(3), w(2). Total 6.
# Total walks per P_3 subgraph = 6 + 6 = 12.
# The number of P_3 subgraphs is sum over all vertices v of (deg(v) choose 2).
# This contributes 12 * sum(deg(v) choose 2).
# So, c_4 = 12.
c4 = 12

# 5. The tree is a star graph (K_1,3), with its 3 edges each traversed twice.
# Let the center be v_c and leaves be v_1, v_2, v_3.
# - Walks starting at v_c: 3! = 6 permutations of excursions to the leaves.
# - Walks starting at a leaf v_i: 2! = 2 permutations of excursions to the other two leaves. Total 3 * 2 = 6.
# Total walks per K_1,3 subgraph = 6 + 6 = 12.
# The number of K_1,3 subgraphs is sum over vertices v of (deg(v) choose 3).
# This contributes 12 * sum(deg(v) choose 3).
# So, c_5 = 12.
c5 = 12

# The problem asks for the coefficients c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5 in this order.
# The final expression is: 2*e + 0*k + 6*p + 12*sum(deg(v) choose 2) + 12*sum(deg(v) choose 3)
