    "The user is asking for the product of a chemical reaction and expects a solution involving code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The reaction is between 1,3-butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a dienophile). This is a classic example of a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n2.  **Determine the product:** The four carbons from butadiene and the two carbons from the ethene derivative will form a cyclohexene ring. I will trace the atoms to determine the exact structure and placement of the substituents (chlorine and fluorine atoms).\n3.  **Name the product:** Based on the structure, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the product molecule. The product's chemical formula is C₆H₆Cl₂F₂ and its name is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.\n4.  **Create a computational task:** A relevant and straightforward calculation for a chemical product is its molar mass. I will write a Python script to calculate this.\n5.  **Write the Python code:** The script will:\n    *   Store the atomic masses of Carbon, Hydrogen, Chlorine, and Fluorine.\n    *   Store the counts of each atom in the product molecule (C₆H₆Cl₂F₂).\n    *   Calculate the total molar mass by summing the mass of all atoms.\n    *   Print the calculation steps clearly, showing how the final number is derived, as requested in the prompt.\n\nThis approach correctly identifies the chemical product and uses a Python script to perform a relevant calculation, fulfilling all aspects of the user's request.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molar_mass():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the product of butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene,\n    and calculates its molar mass.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    # Reactants:\n    # 1,3-butadiene (C4H6)\n    # 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (C2Cl2F2)\n    # The reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n    # Product: 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\n    # Chemical Formula: C6H6Cl2F2\n\n    product_name = \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\"\n    product_formula = \"C6H6Cl2F2\"\n\n    print(f\"The product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is {product_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The chemical formula of the product is {product_formula}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe molar mass of the product is calculated below.\")\n\n    # Standard atomic weights (g/mol)\n    atomic_weights = {\n        'C': 12.011,\n        'H': 1.008,\n        'Cl': 35.453,\n        'F': 18.998\n    }\n\n    # Atom counts in the molecule C6H6Cl2F2\n    molecule_counts = {\n        'C': 6,\n        'H': 6,\n        'Cl': 2,\n        'F': 2\n    }\n\n    total_mass = 0\n    equation_terms = []\n    \n    # Build the equation string parts and calculate total mass\n    # The order is just for display purposes\n    for element in ['C', 'H', 'Cl', 'F']:\n        count = molecule_counts[element]\n        weight = atomic_weights[element]\n        contribution = count * weight\n        total_mass += contribution\n        # Create a string for each part of the equation, e.g., \"(6 * 12.011)\"\n        equation_terms.append(f\"({count} * {weight})\")\n\n    # Print the full equation showing each number\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_terms)\n    print(f\"Molar Mass = {equation_str}\")\n    \n    # Calculate and print the value of each term\n    term_values = []\n    for element in ['C', 'H', 'Cl', 'F']:\n        count = molecule_counts[element]\n        weight = atomic_weights[element]\n        term_values.append(f\"{(count * weight):.3f}\")\n\n    intermediate_str = \" + \".join(term_values)\n    print(f\"Molar Mass = {intermediate_str}\")\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"Molar Mass = {total_mass:.3f} g/mol\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_molar_mass()\n```\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
