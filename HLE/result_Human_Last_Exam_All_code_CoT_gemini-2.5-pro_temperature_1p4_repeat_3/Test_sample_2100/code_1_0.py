    # The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote the libretto for the rock opera "Juno and Avos".
    # The opera is about the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.
    # Rezanov undertook a famous sea voyage, which fits the "sailor" description.
    # He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His grave was lost after the cathedral where he was buried was destroyed.
    # A campaign to find the grave and erect a new monument gained momentum in the late 1980s,
    # leading to the rediscovery of the site. This matches the final clue.
