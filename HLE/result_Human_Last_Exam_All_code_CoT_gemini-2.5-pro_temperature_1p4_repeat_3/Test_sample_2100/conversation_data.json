    "My plan to solve this riddle is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the key clues provided in the user's query: the poet Andrei Voznesensky, the description \"a joy-discovering sailor,\" and the fact that the location of his grave was discovered in the late 1980s.\n2.  I'll connect these clues to a prominent historical figure featured in Voznesensky's work. The most famous work fitting this description is the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n3.  I will identify the protagonist of \"Juno and Avos,\" the Russian explorer and diplomat whose story matches the clues.\n4.  I will confirm that the timeline of the discovery of this figure's grave matches the \"late 1980s\" detail.\n5.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to store and print the last name of this person, fulfilling the request for a coded solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle about the historical figure mentioned by Voznesensky.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n    # The opera is about the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n    # Rezanov undertook a famous sea voyage, which fits the \"sailor\" description.\n    # He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His grave was lost after the cathedral where he was buried was destroyed.\n    # A campaign to find the grave and erect a new monument gained momentum in the late 1980s,\n    # leading to the rediscovery of the site. This matches the final clue.\n    \n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    \n    print(f\"The man Andrei Voznesensky called 'a joy-discovering sailor' is Nikolai {last_name}.\")\n    print(f\"His last name is: {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
