    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\nFirst, I will identify the noble gases and find their typical abundances in Earth's atmosphere, which is their primary reservoir. The rarest noble gas is Radon (Rn), because it is radioactive and quickly decays, resulting in an extremely low equilibrium concentration. Xenon (Xe) is the rarest *stable* noble gas. To definitively answer the question, the code must include Radon.\n\nThe provided year, 2002, does not significantly alter the result, as the atmospheric concentrations of these gases are stable over very long periods.\n\nMy python script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Store the name, atmospheric abundance (in parts per million by volume), and molar mass for each noble gas in a list of dictionaries. I will use an estimated, representative value for Radon's highly variable concentration.\n2.  Define constants for the total mass of the Earth, the mass of the atmosphere, and the average molar mass of air.\n3.  Iterate through each gas, and for each one, calculate its total mass in the atmosphere and then express that mass as a percentage of the total mass of the Earth.\n4.  Keep track of the gas with the minimum calculated percentage.\n5.  Finally, print a concluding statement that identifies the rarest noble gas and shows the numbers used in the final calculation for that gas.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the abundance of noble gases as a percentage of Earth's total mass\n    to determine which one is the rarest.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Constants ---\n    # Mass of Earth in kg\n    MASS_EARTH_KG = 5.972e24\n    # Mass of Earth's atmosphere in kg\n    MASS_ATMOSPHERE_KG = 5.15e18\n    # Average molar mass of dry air in g/mol\n    AVG_MOLAR_MASS_AIR_G_MOL = 28.97\n\n    # Data for noble gases:\n    # Abundance is in parts per million (ppm) by volume in the atmosphere.\n    # Molar mass is in g/mol.\n    # Note: Radon's concentration is extremely low and variable. 6e-14 ppm is a representative value\n    # for the entire atmosphere, corresponding to a total mass of a few kilograms.\n    noble_gases = [\n        {'name': 'Helium (He)', 'abundance_ppm_v': 5.24, 'molar_mass': 4.0026},\n        {'name': 'Neon (Ne)', 'abundance_ppm_v': 18.18, 'molar_mass': 20.180},\n        {'name': 'Argon (Ar)', 'abundance_ppm_v': 9340, 'molar_mass': 39.948},\n        {'name': 'Krypton (Kr)', 'abundance_ppm_v': 1.14, 'molar_mass': 83.798},\n        {'name': 'Xenon (Xe)', 'abundance_ppm_v': 0.087, 'molar_mass': 131.29},\n        {'name': 'Radon (Rn)', 'abundance_ppm_v': 6e-14, 'molar_mass': 222.0} # Extremely rare due to radioactivity\n    ]\n\n    rarest_gas = None\n    min_percentage = float('inf')\n\n    print(\"Calculating the percentage of each noble gas relative to total Earth mass...\\n\")\n\n    for gas in noble_gases:\n        # Step 1: Convert abundance from ppm (by volume) to a direct volume fraction\n        volume_fraction = gas['abundance_ppm_v'] / 1_000_000\n\n        # Step 2: Estimate mass fraction in the atmosphere\n        # Mass fraction â‰ˆ Volume fraction * (Molar Mass of Gas / Molar Mass of Air)\n        mass_fraction_in_atmosphere = volume_fraction * (gas['molar_mass'] / AVG_MOLAR_MASS_AIR_G_MOL)\n\n        # Step 3: Calculate the total mass of the gas in the atmosphere\n        total_mass_of_gas_kg = mass_fraction_in_atmosphere * MASS_ATMOSPHERE_KG\n\n        # Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the gas relative to Earth's total mass\n        percentage_of_earth_mass = (total_mass_of_gas_kg / MASS_EARTH_KG) * 100\n\n        if percentage_of_earth_mass < min_percentage:\n            min_percentage = percentage_of_earth_mass\n            rarest_gas = gas\n\n    # Output the final result and show the calculation for the rarest gas\n    if rarest_gas:\n        print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas['name']}.\")\n        print(\"\\n--- Calculation Breakdown for the Rarest Gas ---\")\n        \n        # Redo calculations for the final print statement\n        rg_vol_frac = rarest_gas['abundance_ppm_v'] / 1_000_000\n        rg_mass_frac_atm = rg_vol_frac * (rarest_gas['molar_mass'] / AVG_MOLAR_MASS_AIR_G_MOL)\n        rg_mass_kg = rg_mass_frac_atm * MASS_ATMOSPHERE_KG\n        rg_perc_earth = (rg_mass_kg / MASS_EARTH_KG) * 100\n\n        print(f\"1.
