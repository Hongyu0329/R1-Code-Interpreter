    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we first need to establish the parameters of the problem and then apply the appropriate formula.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine Parameters:**\n    *   The problem provides the ambient space weights: `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n    *   The problem provides a defining polynomial: `0 = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3`.\n    *   A Calabi-Yau link is the link of an isolated singularity of a weighted-homogeneous polynomial. We must first check if the polynomial is weighted-homogeneous with the given weights. The weighted degree of a monomial `z_1^a_1 ... z_n^a_n` is `a_1*w_1 + ... + a_n*w_n`.\n        *   `deg(z_1^8*z_3)` = 8*22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225\n        *   `deg(z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3)` = 4*22 + 3*29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224\n        *   `deg(z_1*z_2^7)` = 1*22 + 7*29 = 22 + 203 = 225\n        *   All other terms also have a degree of 225.\n    *   Since one term has a different degree (224), the polynomial as written is not weighted-homogeneous. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a weighted projective space, the degree `d` is typically the sum of the weights. Let's verify: `d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`. This matches the degree of most terms. We will proceed assuming the polynomial is weighted-homogeneous with degree `d = 225`.\n\n2.  **Select the Formula:**\n    The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the link of an isolated singularity defined by a weighted-homogeneous polynomial is given by `μ + σ` (Milnor number + signature). A combinatorial formula from Crawley and Nordström allows for its calculation from `d` and `w_i`:\n    Invariant = `Sum_{j≥0} Product_{i=1 to n} C(b_i - j)`\n    where `b_i = w_i / gcd(d, w_i)` and the function `C(k)` is 2 if `k > 0` and 1 if `k = 0`. The sum is over non-negative integers `j` as long as `b_i - j` remains non-negative for all `i`.\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    The following Python script implements this plan. It calculates the `b_i` parameters, determines the range for `j`, computes the contribution for each `j`, and sums them to find the invariant, printing the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define weights and degree\n    # The weights of the ambient space C^5\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    n = len(weights)\n    \n    # The degree 'd' is the sum of the weights for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.\n    # This is consistent with most monomials in the user-provided polynomial.\n    d = sum(weights)\n    \n    print(\"This script calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation assumes a weighted-homogeneous polynomial in C^{n} with:\")\n    print(f\"Weights w = {weights}\")\n    print(f\"Degree  d = sum(w_i) = {d}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the parameters b_i = w_i / gcd(d, w_i)\n    g = [math.gcd(d, w) for w in weights]\n    b = [w // gi for w, gi in zip(weights, g)]\n    \n    print(\"The formula for the invariant requires the following parameters:\")\n    print(f\"g_i = gcd(d, w_i): {g}\")\n    print(f\"b_i = w_i / g_i:   {b}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the invariant using the combinatorial formula.\n    # The invariant is Sum_{j>=0} Product_{i=1..n} C(b_i - j),\n    # where C(k) = 2 if k > 0 and C(0) = 1.\n    # The sum is finite, running for j from 0 up to min(b).\n    try:\n        min_b = min(b)\n    except ValueError:\n        min_b = -1 # Handle empty list case\n\n    total_invariant = 0\n    contributions = []\n    \n    print(\"Calculating contributions for each term in the sum (from j=0 to j=min(b)):\\n\")\n    for j in range(min_b + 1):\n        exponents = [bi - j for bi in b]\n        \n        num_positive = sum(1 for p in exponents if p > 0)\n        num_zero = n - num_positive # Since p cannot be negative in the sum\n        \n        # Contribution is 2^num_positive * 1^num_zero\n        contribution = 2**num_positive\n        contributions.append(contribution)\n        total_invariant += contribution\n        \n        print(f\"Term for j = {j}:\")\n        print(f\"  Exponents (b_i - j): {exponents}\")\n        # The final equation requires each number. 2^{num_positive} shows the components.\n        print(f\"  Contribution = 2^{num_positive} * 1^{num_zero} = {contribution}\")\n        \n    # Step 4: Print the final result and equation\n    print(\"\\n-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is the sum of these contributions.\")\n    \n    equation_parts = [str(c) for c in contributions]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"Final Equation: {equation_str} = {total_invariant}\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    return total_invariant\n\n# Run the calculation and store the final answer\nresult = calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n# The final answer will be enclosed in <<<>>> at the very end.\n```\n<<<48>>>"
