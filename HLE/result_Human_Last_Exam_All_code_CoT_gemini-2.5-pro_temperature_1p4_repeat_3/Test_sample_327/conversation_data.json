    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we can use the canonical construction of game values. The number of pieces for a game with value `x` corresponds to the number of edges in its canonical game graph.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Representation**: A number `x` in Red-Blue Hackenbush is represented by a game `G(x)`. We need to find the number of pieces (edges) in the canonical game `G(13/16)`.\n2.  **Use the Recursive Formula**: The number of pieces for a dyadic rational `x = m / 2^k` can be calculated recursively. Let `N(x)` be the number of pieces for the game `x`.\n    *   If `x` is an integer `n`, `N(n) = |n|`.\n    *   If `x` is a non-integer, `x = floor(x) + {x}`, where `{x}` is the fractional part. Then `N(x) = N(floor(x)) + N({x})`. For `13/16`, `floor(x) = 0`, so we only need to find `N(13/16)`.\n    *   For a fraction `y = m / 2^k` with `0 < y < 1` and `m` being odd, the game is constructed as `G(y) = { G((m-1)/2^k) | G((m+1)/2^k) }`. This construction requires one piece to join the left and right options, so the number of pieces is `N(y) = 1 + N((m-1)/2^k) + N((m+1)/2^k)`. Note that the fractions on the right will simplify because `m-1` and `m+1` are even.\n3.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script that implements this recursive calculation with memoization to avoid re-computing the same values. The script will print out the steps of the calculation to show how the final number is derived.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Memoization cache to store results for fractions we've already calculated\nmemo = {}\n\ndef count_hackenbush_pieces(m, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively calculates the number of pieces for the canonical game\n    representing the fraction m/d in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use a tuple (m, d) as the key for the memoization cache\n    original_m, original_d = m, d\n    \n    # Always simplify the fraction first\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(m, d)\n    m //= common_divisor\n    d //= common_divisor\n\n    if (m, d) in memo:\n        return memo[(m, d)]\n\n    # --- Base Cases ---\n    # Case 1: The fraction is an integer (denominator is 1)\n    if d == 1:\n        # For an integer n, the game is n red pieces.
