    # We are asked to find delta_1 + delta_2 based on the properties of towers
    # in P(omega_1) and the assumption that 2^omega_1 = omega_2.

    # Step 1: Determine delta_2 = inf(X).
    # delta_2 is the tower number for omega_1, t(omega_1).
    # A theorem by Just and Shelah states that t(omega_1) > omega_1.
    # Since delta_2 is the infimum of a set of regular cardinals and must be
    # greater than omega_1, the smallest it can be is the next regular
    # cardinal, which is omega_2.
    # So, delta_2 >= omega_2.

    # Step 2: Determine delta_1 = sup(X).
    # The length of a tower is bounded by the size of the poset P(omega_1)/fin.
    # The size of this poset is 2^omega_1.
    # Given 2^omega_1 = omega_2, the size is omega_2.
    # Thus, any lambda in X must satisfy lambda <= omega_2.
    # This implies delta_1 = sup(X) <= omega_2.

    # Step 3: Combine the bounds.
    # We have omega_2 <= delta_2 <= delta_1 <= omega_2.
    # This forces both delta_1 and delta_2 to be omega_2.
