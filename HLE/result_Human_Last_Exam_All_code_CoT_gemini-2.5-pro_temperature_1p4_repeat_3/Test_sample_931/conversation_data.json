    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will write a Python script that evaluates the given options based on established biological facts about their diet.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish the known dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans from entomological sources. They are primarily predators of small, soft-bodied insects and also supplement their diet with pollen and nectar.\n2.  Analyze each answer choice against these facts.\n3.  Choice A (Nectar) is a known supplementary food source.\n4.  Choice E (Aphids) is a known primary food source.\n5.  Choices B, C, and D are incorrect as snakeflies are not known to eat fungus or leaf tissue, and the specific plant species mentioned are native to New Zealand, where Raphidioptera are not naturally found.\n6.  Since both A and E are correct, the script will conclude that option F, which combines them, is the correct answer.\n7.  The script will print this logical breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef solve_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary options for adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    and prints the logical conclusion.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Known facts about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans\n    fact_1 = \"Adult Raphidiopterans are primarily predaceous.\"\n    fact_2 = \"They feed on small, soft-bodied arthropods, especially aphids and psyllids.\"\n    fact_3 = \"They are also known to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the dietary choices for adult Raphidiopterans based on known facts:\\n\")\n\n    # Evaluating each choice\n    print(\"Choice A: Nectar\")\n    print(\"  - Verdict: Correct.
