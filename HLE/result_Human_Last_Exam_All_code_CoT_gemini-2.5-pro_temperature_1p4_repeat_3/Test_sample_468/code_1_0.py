# The genus "Perdita" is a large group of small, often brightly colored bees,
# found primarily in the arid regions of North and Central America.
# While they were known to entomologists for a long time, they lacked a formal common name.

# In 2011, entomologists Jerome G. Rozen, Jr., and Bryan N. Danforth published a paper
# in the Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society titled:
# "The Common Name of the Genus Perdita (Andrenidae, Panurginae): Perdita, the Fairy Bees."
# In this paper, they formally proposed the name.

# The final answer is constructed by combining the name and the year.
# The number '2011' is part of the final output string as requested.
