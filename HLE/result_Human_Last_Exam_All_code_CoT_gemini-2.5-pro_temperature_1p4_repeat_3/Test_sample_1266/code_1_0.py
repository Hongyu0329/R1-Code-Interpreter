            (2E)-4-Hydroxy-2-nonen-8-ynal (HNY) is a reactive electrophile.
            In cells, electrophiles trigger the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway.
            HNY modifies the Keap1 protein, releasing the transcription factor Nrf2.
            Nrf2 then travels to the nucleus and increases the expression of antioxidant genes, including Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH).
            Therefore, treating cells with HNY causes an INCREASE in the amount of ALDH."""),

        "2. Comparing HNY and 4-OI": textwrap.dedent("""
            4-octyl-itaconate (4-OI) is known as a very potent and specific activator of the Nrf2 pathway.
            It is generally considered a stronger Nrf2 inducer than endogenous electrophiles like HNY.
            A stronger activator will lead to a more robust response.
            Therefore, the increase in ALDH will be MORE with 4-OI compared to HNY."""),

        "3. Identifying the protein": textwrap.dedent("""
            The protein that senses the electrophilic stress from both HNY and 4-OI and regulates Nrf2 is Keap1.
            JAK1 is part of the JAK-STAT pathway, which is primarily involved in cytokine signaling, not this specific antioxidant response.
            Therefore, the protein involved is Keap1."""),

        "Conclusion": "Combining these points: the change is an INCREASE, it is MORE with 4-OI, and the protein is Keap1."
