    "Designing a *provably* and *tightly* secure cryptographic scheme from scratch is a significant research endeavor, typically published in peer-reviewed academic papers. It involves deep mathematical proofs to show its security against various classes of attacks. A well-regarded scheme that fits your requirements of a t-out-of-n threshold signature with a two-round signing protocol is **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)**.\n\nInstead of designing a new one, the most practical approach is to demonstrate the core principles of a scheme like FROST. The following Python code provides a simplified, pedagogical implementation of the FROST protocol. This code is for educational purposes to illustrate the mechanics and is **not secure for production use**.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Setup**: Define the basic cryptographic parameters (n, t, prime field) and parties.\n2.  **Key Generation (Trusted Dealer Model)**: For simplicity, a \"trusted dealer\" will generate a secret polynomial using Shamir's Secret Sharing, compute the secret shares for each of the *n* parties, and derive the single group public key. A full DKG (Distributed Key Generation) protocol would be used in a real-world scenario to avoid a trusted dealer.\n3.  **Signing - Round 1 (Commitment)**: Each of the *t* participating signers generates a secret nonce and broadcasts a public commitment. This is the first round of communication.\n4.  **Signing - Round 2 (Signature Share Generation)**: After receiving all commitments from Round 1, each signer computes a group commitment and a challenge. They then use their secret share and nonce to compute and broadcast their partial signature. This is the second round.\n5.  **Signature Aggregation**: An aggregator (who can be one of the signers) collects the *t* partial signatures and combines them into a single final signature.\n6.  **Verification**: A verifier uses the group public key, the message, and the final signature to confirm its validity. The final output will print the verification equation with all the computed numbers.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\nfrom math import gcd\n\n# --- Helper Functions for Modular Arithmetic ---\n# (These are needed for Shamir's Secret Sharing and Schnorr signatures)\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Returns (gcd, x, y) such that a*x + b*y = gcd.\"\"\"\n    if a == 0:\n        return (b, 0, 1)\n    d, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n    x = y1 - (b // a) * x1\n    y = x1\n    return (d, x, y)\n\ndef mod_inverse(k, p):\n    \"\"\"Returns the modular inverse of k mod p.\"\"\"\n    if gcd(k, p) != 1:\n        return None\n    _, x, _ = extended_gcd(k, p)\n    return x % p\n\ndef lagrange_interpolate(x, points, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the y-value for a given x using Lagrange interpolation over a prime field.\n    'points' is a list of (x, y) coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    x_coords, y_coords = zip(*points)\n    L = 0\n    for i in range(len(points)):\n        num, den = 1, 1\n        for j in range(len(points)):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            num = (num * (x - x_coords[j])) % p\n            den = (den * (x_coords[i] - x_coords[j])) % p\n        term = (y_coords[i] * num * mod_inverse(den, p)) % p\n        L = (L + term) % p\n    return L\n\n# --- Simulation of a 2-Round Threshold Signature Scheme (FROST-inspired) ---\n\ndef run_threshold_signature_demo():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates a simplified 2-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- 1.
