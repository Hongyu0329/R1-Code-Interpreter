    # Step 2: Analyze the relationship
    # An effected object is being created. Its existence is the goal or future result of the action.
    # Let's use an example: The verb 'apo' (to make) and the noun 'óga' (house).
    # When one says "I am making a house" (ajapo óga), the house is an effected object.

    # Step 3: Evaluate compatibility
    # Is the concept of an object being created compatible with the 'past' marker -kue?
    # No. An object that is just coming into existence cannot be a "former" or "ex-" object
    # in the context of the action creating it.
    compatibility_with_kue = False

    # Is the concept of an object being created compatible with the 'future/destined' marker -rã?
    # Yes. The house being built is a "house-to-be" or is "destined" to be a house.
    # In Guarani, this would be expressed as 'ógarã' (house-to-be).
    compatibility_with_ra = True

    # Step 4: Formulate the conclusion
