    Analyzes a quantum logic problem to find the correct logical statement.

    The problem defines three propositions:
    a: The particle has momentum in the interval [0, +1/6].
    b: The particle is in the position interval [-1, 1].
    c: The particle is in the position interval [-1, 3].

    The function determines which of the provided logical expressions is a
    true statement from the viewpoint of quantum logic for this system.
    """

    # Step 1: State the fundamental relationship between the propositions.
    # The position interval for 'b' is [-1, 1].
    # The position interval for 'c' is [-1, 3].
    # Since [-1, 1] is a subset of [-1, 3], proposition 'b' implies 'c'.
    # This is the crucial premise: b -> c.

    # Step 2: Analyze Choice C, which represents the distributive law.
    # Choice C is: (¬(a ∧ b) → (a ∧ c)) ↔ (a ∧ (b ∨ c))
    # We will show this is a true statement for the given system.
    # First, let's simplify the structure of Choice C into the standard distributive law form.
    #
    # The left side of the equivalence in C is: ¬(a ∧ b) → (a ∧ c)
    # Using the logical identity (¬P → Q) ⇔ (P ∨ Q), this becomes:
    # (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)
    # This is the right side of the classic distributive law.
    #
    # The right side of the equivalence in C is: a ∧ (b ∨ c)
    # This is the left side of the classic distributive law.
    #
    # So, Choice C is asking if the following is true:
    # (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c) ↔ a ∧ (b ∨ c)

    # Step 3: Evaluate both sides of the distributive law using the premise b -> c.
    # Let's start with the left side of the law.
    lhs = "(a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)"
    # Because b implies c, the proposition (a ∧ b) is a more specific case of (a ∧ c).
    # Any state satisfying (a ∧ b) must also satisfy (a ∧ c).
    # Therefore, the logical OR (∨) of a specific case and a general case is just the general case.
    lhs_simplified = "(a ∧ c)"

    # Now let's evaluate the right side of the law.
    rhs = "a ∧ (b ∨ c)"
    # Because b implies c, the logical OR (b ∨ c) simplifies to just c.
    # (Being in [-1, 1] OR [-1, 3] is the same as being in [-1, 3]).
    rhs_simplified = "a ∧ c"

    # Step 4: Present the conclusion.
    print("The task is to find a true statement within the given logical framework.")
    print("We analyze Choice C: (¬(a ∧ b) → (a ∧ c)) ↔ (a ∧ (b ∨ c))\n")

    print("This statement is equivalent to the distributive law: (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c) ↔ a ∧ (b ∨ c)\n")

    print("Based on the premise that 'b' implies 'c':")
    print(f"The left-hand side, {lhs}, simplifies to {lhs_simplified}.")
    print(f"The right-hand side, {rhs}, simplifies to {rhs_simplified}.\n")

    print("Since both sides are equivalent to the same proposition, the full statement in Choice C is true.")
    print("The final proven equivalence is:")
    print(f"{lhs_simplified} ↔ {rhs_simplified}")
