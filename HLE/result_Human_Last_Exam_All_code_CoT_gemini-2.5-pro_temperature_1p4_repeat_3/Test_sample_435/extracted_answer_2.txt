I would predict that manufacturing CAR T cells with interleukin-15 would lead to an **increase** in cytokine release upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This is because IL-15 enhances T cell survival, persistence, and overall effector function, leading to a more robust activation response.
