    "Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian liberal politician and historian, was a strong proponent of rationalism and positivism. He was highly critical of the modernist cultural movements of his time, which he viewed as a departure from the civic and social purpose of art. He saw these movements as irrational, mystical, and self-indulgent. The term \"X-Y\" you are looking for refers to the practitioners of two major, often intertwined, artistic and literary movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries that he criticized.\n\nI will write a Python script that prints the full sentence identifying what \"X-Y\" stands for.\n\n```python\ndef solve_milyukov_quote():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the group Pavel Milyukov denounced.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov, a rationalist liberal, was a staunch critic of Modernist art.\n    # He famously referred to the movements of Symbolism and Decadence,\n    # and their practitioners, as a \"stagnant swamp\".\n    x = \"Symbolists\"\n    y = \"Decadents\"\n    \n    print(f\"Pavel Milyukov frequently accused the Western culture of his time and even denounced {x}-{y} as a 'stagnant swamp'.\")\n\nsolve_milyukov_quote()\n```\n<<<Symbolists-Decadents>>>"
