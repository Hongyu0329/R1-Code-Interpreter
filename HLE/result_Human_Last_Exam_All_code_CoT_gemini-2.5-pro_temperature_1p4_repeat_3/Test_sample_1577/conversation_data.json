    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store. The value of `k` is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined, including its genus (`g`, the number of handles) and the number and type of its boundaries (holes).\n\nThere are two types of boundaries for the toric code:\n1.  **Smooth (or magnetic) boundaries:** String operators of Pauli X's can terminate on these boundaries. They are associated with the condensation of magnetic flux (`m`) anyons.\n2.  **Rough (or electric) boundaries:** String operators of Pauli Z's can terminate on these boundaries. They are associated with the condensation of electric charge (`e`) anyons.\n\nThe problem is to find the GSD for a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. The question is slightly ambiguous as it does not specify the genus of the surface or if it's a compact surface (like a sphere) or a non-compact one (like an infinite plane).\n\n**Let's analyze the most common interpretation:** The toric code is implemented on an infinite 2D plane with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes punched out of it. This setup is topologically equivalent to a sphere (`g=0`) with `n` smooth boundaries, `m` rough boundaries, and one additional boundary corresponding to the \"point at infinity\". By convention, this boundary at infinity is treated as a smooth/magnetic boundary.\n\nSo, the equivalent topology is a sphere with:\n*   `n_s = n + 1` smooth boundaries.\n*   `n_r = m` rough boundaries.\n\nThe number of logical qubits `k` for a genus-`g` surface with `n_s` smooth and `n_r` rough boundaries is given by the following well-established formulas:\n*   If only one type of boundary exists (e.g., `n_r=0`), `k = g + n_s - 1`.\n*   If both types of boundaries exist (`n_s > 0` and `n_r > 0`), `k = 2g + n_s + n_r - 1`.\n\nLet's apply these formulas to our plane (`g=0`):\n\n1.  **Case 1: Only smooth holes on the plane (`m=0`)**\n    We have `n_s = n+1` and `n_r = 0`. Since there is only one type of boundary, we use the first formula:\n    `k = g + n_s - 1 = 0 + (n+1) - 1 = n`.\n    This result can also be written as `n+m` since `m=0`.\n\n2.  **Case 2: At least one rough hole on the plane (`m > 0`)**\n    We have `n_s = n+1` and `n_r = m`. Since `n_s > 0` and `n_r > 0`, we have both types of boundaries and must use the second formula:\n    `k = 2g + n_s + n_r - 1 = 2*0 + (n+1) + m - 1 = n+m`.\n\nIn all cases, the number of logical qubits `k` for a plane with `n` smooth and `m` rough holes is `k = n + m`.\n\nTherefore, the ground space degeneracy is `2^k = 2^(n+m)`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value for given `n` and `m` and prints the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_toric_code_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy of the toric code on a plane\n    with a given number of smooth and rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Example values for n (smooth holes) and m (rough holes)\n    # You can change these values to test other scenarios.\n    n = 3\n    m = 2\n\n    # The problem asks for the general formula. Based on the analysis, the\n    # number of logical qubits k on an infinite plane is n + m.\n    # The ground space degeneracy is 2^k.\n\n    print(f\"For a toric code on a plane with n={n} smooth holes and m={m} rough holes:\")\n    print(f\"The number of logical qubits is k = n + m = {n} + {m} = {n+m}.\")\n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy is 2^k.\")\n    \n    # The final answer is the formula itself.\n    # We output the components of the formula as requested.\n    print(f\"Final Equation: 2^({n} + {m})\")\n\nsolve_toric_code_degeneracy()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
