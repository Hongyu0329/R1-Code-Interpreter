    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we will analyze the residues at the core positions of the characteristic heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. The size and hydrophobicity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state due to \"knobs-into-holes\" packing constraints.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Assign the Heptad Register:** We will identify the repeating `(abcdefg)` pattern in the sequence to determine which amino acids fall into the `a` and `d` core positions. The most stable assignment places the bulky, non-polar residues in the core.\n2.  **Analyze Core Residues:** We will examine the types of amino acids found at the `a` and `d` positions. We will classify them by size (e.g., small, large, very large).\n3.  **Apply Packing Rules:** We will use established principles of coiled-coil stability:\n    *   **Dimers (2-helical)** are favored when both `a` and `d` positions are occupied by large hydrophobic residues (e.g., Leucine, Isoleucine, Tryptophan).\n    *   **Trimers (3-helical)** are often formed when the `a` position is occupied by a small residue (e.g., Alanine) and the `d` position by a large one.\n    *   **Tetramers (4-helical)** and higher-order states have more complex sequence requirements.\n4.  **Predict the State:** Based on the analysis, particularly noting any residues with strong predictive power like Tryptophan, we will determine the most likely oligomeric state.\n\nThe following Python script will automate this analysis and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef predict_coiled_coil_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence by analyzing\n    the residues at its core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence (str): The amino acid sequence of the protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Assign the heptad repeat register and extract core residues.\n    # Through manual inspection, the most chemically sensible register is found.\n    # A repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues every 3-4 positions is characteristic.\n    # The register that places the maximum number of hydrophobic residues (I, L, W)\n    # in the core 'a' and 'd' positions is chosen.\n    # In this sequence, this corresponds to the 'd' positions starting at index 2\n    # and 'a' positions starting at index 6 (0-based indexing).\n    \n    a_indices = [6, 13, 20, 28]\n    d_indices = [2, 9, 16, 24]\n\n    residues_a = [sequence[i] for i in a_indices if i < len(sequence)]\n    residues_d = [sequence[i] for i in d_indices if i < len(sequence)]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identified Core Residues\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Residues at 'a' positions: {', '.join(residues_a)}\")\n    print(f\"Residues at 'd' positions: {', '.join(residues_d)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the properties of core residues.\n    # The size of the residue side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions\n    # dictates the packing efficiency and, thus, the oligomeric state.\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of Core Residue Properties\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------\")\n    # 'I' (Isoleucine) and 'L' (Leucine) are large hydrophobic residues.\n    # 'W' (Tryptophan) is a very large hydrophobic residue.\n    # Dimer Rule: Favored by large residues at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    # Trimer Rule: Favored by small residues (e.g., Ala) at 'a' and large at 'd'.\n\n    # Analysis of the specific residues found:\n    # All 'd' positions are Isoleucine (I), which is large.\n    # The 'a' positions are Leucine (L) and Tryptophan (W), which are large and very large.\n    \n    print(\"Observation 1: The 'a' and 'd' positions are exclusively occupied by large hydrophobic residues (I, L, W).\")\n    print(\"Observation 2: A Tryptophan (W) is present at an 'a' position.
