    Solves the problem of finding the Lebesgue measure of the set S.
    """
    
    # The user asks for the Lebesgue measure of the set S, where S is the set of initial points x_0
    # for which the sequence x_{n+1} = f(x_n) has exactly 7 distinct values.
    # The function is f(x) = (2*x + sin(2*pi*x)) / 3.
    
    # 1. The set S consists of points x_0 whose orbit {x_0, x_1, x_2, ...} is a finite set of size 7.
    #    This implies that for each x_0 in S, the sequence must be eventually periodic.
    #    Such points are called pre-periodic points.
    #    Therefore, S is a subset of the set of all pre-periodic points of f.
    
    # 2. The function f(x) is real analytic on [0, 1]. For a real analytic function (which is not identity on an interval),
    #    the set of points satisfying f^k(x) = x for any integer k > 0 is a finite set.
    #    The set of all periodic points is the union of these finite sets for all k, so it is a countable set.
    
    # 3. The set of pre-periodic points consists of all points that eventually map into the set of periodic points.
    #    Let E be the set of periodic points. The set of pre-periodic points is the union of f^{-n}(E) for n >= 0.
    #    The equation f(y) = x can have at most 3 solutions for y for any given x. This means the preimage of any
    #    single point is a finite set.
    #    The preimage of a countable set under f is therefore also countable.
    #    By induction, the set of pre-periodic points is a countable union of countable sets, which is itself countable.
    
    # 4. In Lebesgue measure theory, any countable subset of the real numbers has a measure of zero.
    
    # 5. Since S is a subset of the countable set of pre-periodic points, the Lebesgue measure of S is 0.
    
    lebesgue_measure_of_S = 0
    
    # The question asks for this measure multiplied by 10^6.
