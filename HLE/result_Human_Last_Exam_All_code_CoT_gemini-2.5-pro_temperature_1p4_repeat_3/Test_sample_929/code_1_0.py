# The ethogram defines behaviors with start and end events.
# 1: investigation start, 2: investigation end
# 3: interaction start,   4: interaction end
# 5: feeding start,       6: feeding end

# For the plant, fitness is primarily driven by successful pollination.
# Let's analyze the value of each behavior type for the plant.

# Investigation: Non-contact, zero chance of pollination.
investigation_value = 0

# Interaction: Contact, but not necessarily with flowers. Low chance of pollination.
interaction_value = 1

# Feeding: Contact with flowers to consume nectar. Highest chance of pollination.
feeding_value = 10

# The goal is to find the behavioral pattern that results in the highest "fitness score".
# The choices compare the *duration* of these events.
# Duration is calculated as (end_event_time - start_event_time).

# Let's represent the duration of feeding and interaction symbolically.
# We are looking for the relationship that maximizes plant fitness.
duration_feeding_symbol = "6-5"
duration_interaction_symbol = "4-3"

# Scenario B: 6-5 >> 4-3
# This means the duration of feeding is much greater than the duration of general interaction.
# Example: An insect lands and spends almost all its time feeding.
# This maximizes the time spent in the most valuable state for pollination.
fitness_scenario_B = f"A long duration of feeding ({duration_feeding_symbol}) is much more valuable (fitness_value={feeding_value}) than a long duration of general interaction ({duration_interaction_symbol}, fitness_value={interaction_value})."

# Scenario A: 4-3 >> 6-5
# This means the insect spends a lot of time just walking on the plant, and very little time feeding.
# This is inefficient for pollination.
fitness_scenario_A = f"A long duration of general interaction ({duration_interaction_symbol}) with a low fitness value is not as good as a long duration of feeding ({duration_feeding_symbol})."

# Conclusion: The greatest positive effect on plant fitness comes from maximizing
# the time spent in the behavior most likely to cause pollination, which is feeding.
# Therefore, long feeding bouts are the most desirable pattern.

print("The pattern with the greatest positive effect on plant fitness is when the duration of feeding is much greater than the duration of other interactions.")

# The '6' represents feeding_end, '5' represents feeding_start.
# The '4' represents interaction_end, '3' represents interaction_start.
