    This function explains and prints the derived upper-bound factor.
    The problem asks for an upper-bound for ||B * Q_{0, M}||_inf, expressed as a factor of sqrt(N),
    under the condition that beta > 0.

    Based on the derivation explained in the thinking steps, the upper-bound can be found as:
    ||B * Q_{0, M}||_inf <= (1 - ln(beta)) * sqrt(N)

    The factor of sqrt(N) is therefore (1 - ln(beta)).
