    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$, we can use a formula derived from the classification of tori by Steinberg.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Formula:** The total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group $G$ is given by the sum over its Weyl group $W$:\n    $$ N = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\det(qI - w) $$\n    where $w$ acts on the reflection representation $V$ of dimension $n=\\text{rank}(G)$. For $E_8$, the rank is $n=8$.\n\n2.  **Rewrite the Formula:** This sum can be expressed using the character theory of $W$. Let $a_k = \\dim((\\wedge^k V)^W)$ be the dimension of the invariant subspace of the $k$-th exterior power of the reflection representation. The formula becomes:\n    $$ N = |W| \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k a_k q^{n-k} $$\n\n3.  **Compute Coefficients $a_k$:** We need to find the dimensions $a_k$ for the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This is equivalent to finding the multiplicity of the trivial representation in the character of $\\wedge^k V$. Based on the known character theory of $W(E_8)$:\n    *   For $k=0$, $\\wedge^0 V$ is the one-dimensional trivial representation, so its invariant subspace is the space itself. Thus, $a_0 = 1$.\n    *   For $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 8\\}$, the representations $\\wedge^k V$ of $W(E_8)$ are known to not contain the trivial representation as a constituent. This means for any vector $v \\in \\wedge^k V$, there is some $w \\in W$ such that $w(v) \\neq v$ (unless $v=0$). Therefore, the invariant subspace is {0}, and its dimension is 0. So, $a_k = 0$ for $k=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Number:** Substitute the coefficients $a_k$ into the formula for $N$:\n    $$ N = |W(E_8)| (a_0 q^8 - a_1 q^7 + a_2 q^6 - \\dots + a_8) $$\n    $$ N = |W(E_8)| (1 \\cdot q^8 - 0 \\cdot q^7 + 0 \\cdot q^6 - \\dots + 0) = |W(E_8)| q^8 $$\n\n5.  **Determine the Order of the Weyl Group $|W(E_8)|$:** The order of the Weyl group of type $E_8$ is a well-known value, which we can compute. The formula is:\n    $$ |W(E_8)| = \\frac{8! \\cdot |\\Phi|}{\\det(C)} $$\n    where $\\Phi$ is the root system and $C$ is the Cartan matrix. A more direct formula using the degrees of fundamental invariants ($d_i$) is $|W| = \\prod d_i \\cdot n!/|\\det(C)|...$ Actually the order is just a known number computed as $2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$.\n    $|W(E_8)| = 696,729,600$.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Expression:** The final answer is the product of this number and $q^8$.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to provide the final expression for the number of tori.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact number of Fq-rational maximal tori for a reductive group of type E8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The rank of the E8 group\n    n = 8\n\n    # The order of the Weyl group of E8 is 2^14 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7\n    W_order = (2**14) * (3**5) * (5**2) * 7\n\n    # For E8, the dimension of the invariant subspace of the k-th exterior power\n    # of the reflection representation, a_k, is 1 for k=0 and 0 for k=1,...,8.\n    a = [0] * (n + 1)\n    a[0] = 1\n\n    # The total number of tori is given by the formula:\n    # N = |W| * sum_{k=0 to n} (-1)^k * a_k * q^(n-k)\n    # Since only a[0] is non-zero, this simplifies to |W| * a[0] * q^n.\n\n    # We are asked to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The final equation is N = W_order * (a[0]*q^8 - a[1]*q^7 + ... + a[8])\n    # The term in the parenthesis is (1*q^8 - 0*q^7 + ... + 0) = q^8\n    \n    print(f\"The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is given by the formula: |W(E8)| * (a_0*q^8 - a_1*q^7 + ... + a_8)\")\n    print(f\"The order of the Weyl group W(E8) is {W_order}.\")\n    print(\"The coefficients a_k = dim((wedge^k V)^W) are:\")\n    print(f\"a_0 = {a[0]}\")\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(f\"a_{k} = {a[k]}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstituting these values, the expression simplifies:\")\n    equation = f\"{W_order} * ({a[0]}*q**8)\"\n    print(f\"N = {equation}\")\n\nsolve_tori_number()\n```\n<<<696729600 * q**8>>>"
