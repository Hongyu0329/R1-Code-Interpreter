def solve_topological_group_problem():
  """
  This function determines the number of totally bounded group topologies
  on the integers with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

  The reasoning is as follows:
  1. A totally bounded topological group (G) is a dense subgroup of a
     compact group (its completion, K). The topology on G is the subspace
     topology inherited from K. Here, G is the group of integers (Z).

  2. The condition of having no nontrivial convergent sequences means that
     any sequence in Z that converges to a point in Z must be eventually
     constant. This implies that Z, as a subspace of its completion K, must
     be a discrete space.

  3. Therefore, Z must be a discrete and dense subgroup of a compact group K.

  4. A fundamental theorem of topological groups states that any discrete
     subgroup of a compact group must be finite.

  5. This would imply that Z is a finite group, which is a contradiction since
     the integers are infinite.

  6. Due to this contradiction, the initial assumption that such a topology
     exists must be false.

  7. Consequently, the number of such topologies is 0.
