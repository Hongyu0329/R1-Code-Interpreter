    a. The C program is correct for the two given examples. Answer: Y.

    b. The C program is correct for all inputs. The task is to find the
       value of the `unsigned long long` variable `s` for the input "localization".
       The program stores the first 7 characters ("localiz") and then the last
       character ('n') in the 8-byte variable `s`. We calculate its integer
       value assuming a little-endian architecture.
