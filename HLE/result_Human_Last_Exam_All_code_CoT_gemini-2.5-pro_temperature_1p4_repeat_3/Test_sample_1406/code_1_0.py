The problem asks for the number of positive integers n for which the n-cube [0,1]^n
cannot occur as the set of non-block points of any continuum.

Let's review the definitions:
- A continuum is a compact, connected, non-empty metric space.
- A space S is continuum-connected if for any two points x, y in S, there exists a continuum K such that {x, y} is a subset of K, and K is a subset of S.
- A point p in a continuum X is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a continuum-connected dense subset.

To solve this, we use a powerful result from point-set topology.

    # State the characterization theorem.
    theorem_text = """
A characterization theorem by H. Cook states:
A topological space M is homeomorphic to the set of non-block points of some continuum if and only if M is homeomorphic to a continuum-connected G_delta subset of the Hilbert cube ([0,1]^omega).

    # Analyze the n-cube with respect to the theorem's conditions.
    analysis_text = """
We need to check if the n-cube, M = [0,1]^n, satisfies these two conditions for n = 1, 2, 3, ...

Condition 1: Is [0,1]^n homeomorphic to a G_delta subset of the Hilbert cube?
For any n >= 1, the n-cube [0,1]^n is a compact metric space. Any compact metric space can be embedded as a subspace of the Hilbert cube. The image of a compact set under a continuous map into a Hausdorff space (like the Hilbert cube) is compact. A compact subset of a metric space is closed. Every closed set in a metric space is a G_delta set.
Thus, [0,1]^n satisfies the first condition for all n >= 1.

Condition 2: Is [0,1]^n continuum-connected?
For any n >= 1, let x and y be any two points in [0,1]^n. The set [0,1]^n is convex, which means the straight line segment L connecting x and y is entirely contained within [0,1]^n. This line segment L is the continuous image of the interval [0,1], so it is compact and connected. Therefore, L is a continuum.
Since for any pair of points {x, y}, there is a continuum L with {x, y} subset of L subset of [0,1]^n, the n-cube is continuum-connected.
This is true for all n >= 1.

    # State the conclusion.
    conclusion_text = """
Conclusion:
Since the n-cube [0,1]^n satisfies both conditions of Cook's theorem for all positive integers n (n=1, 2, 3, ...), it means that for any n >= 1, the n-cube *can* be realized as the set of non-block points of some continuum.

The question asks for the number of values of n for which it *fails* to occur. Based on our analysis, there are no such values.
