The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition states that the anomaly of a global symmetry, a robust quantity independent of the energy scale, must be identical in the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) descriptions of a quantum field theory.

The most profound physical implication of this principle is:

Choice C: Constraint on low-energy effective theories.

Here is the reasoning:
1.  **Robustness:** Anomalies of global symmetries are determined by the fundamental fields at high energies (UV) and do not change under continuous deformations of the theory, such as changing mass parameters or the coupling constant.
2.  **Consistency Check:** Any valid low-energy (IR) effective theory, which describes the dynamics in terms of composite particles (like mesons and baryons in QCD), must reproduce the exact same anomaly value as the UV theory (described by quarks and gluons).
3.  **Predictive Power:** This requirement is not trivial. It imposes a powerful, non-perturbative constraint on the spectrum of massless particles (either massless fermions or Goldstone bosons from symmetry breaking) and their interactions in the IR. If a proposed IR theory fails to match the anomaly, it is physically inconsistent and must be discarded.

In essence, the anomaly matching condition acts as a crucial guide, limiting the possible phases and dynamics of strongly coupled theories, which are otherwise intractable. It dictates what a consistent low-energy world can look like.
