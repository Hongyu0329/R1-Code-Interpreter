# The problem asks for the order type of a set of cardinals, X.
# My analysis based on combinatorial set theory leads to the conclusion that
# X = {omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7}.

# The set of indices of the omega cardinals in X is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
# The order type of a finite, well-ordered set is simply its cardinality (the number of elements).

# We can calculate the number of elements in the set of indices.
# Let the lowest index be i_min and the highest index be i_max.
i_min = 0
i_max = 7

# The number of elements in an inclusive range [min, max] is max - min + 1.
number_of_elements = i_max - i_min + 1

# The order type is this number.
order_type = number_of_elements

# Print the numbers used in the final calculation.
print(f"Lowest index: {i_min}")
print(f"Highest index: {i_max}")
print(f"Final equation: {i_max} - {i_min} + 1 = {order_type}")
# Print the final result for the order type.
print(f"The order type of X is: {order_type}")
