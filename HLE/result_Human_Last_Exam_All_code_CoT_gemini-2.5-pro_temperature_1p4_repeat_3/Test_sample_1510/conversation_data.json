    "To determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Represent the Data**: I will create a data structure, specifically a Python dictionary, to store the 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their corresponding point groups (crystal classes).\n2.  **Filter the Data**: I will iterate through this dictionary to identify and collect all the wallpaper groups whose point group order is exactly 2.\n3.  **Count and Display**: I will count the number of groups found in the previous step. Then, I will print the names of these groups, show the summation that leads to the total count (as requested), and state the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of wallpaper groups\n    with a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their respective point groups.\n    # The point group (or crystal class) describes the symmetries (rotations, reflections)\n    # that leave at least one point fixed.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        'p1': 1,\n        'p2': 2,\n        'pm': 2,\n        'pg': 2,\n        'cm': 2,\n        'pmm': 4,\n        'pmg': 4,\n        'pgg': 4,\n        'cmm': 4,\n        'p4': 4,\n        'p4m': 8,\n        'p4g': 8,\n        'p3': 3,\n        'p3m1': 6,\n        'p31m': 6,\n        'p6': 6,\n        'p6m': 12\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    # Find the groups with a point group of the target order\n    matching_groups = []\n    for group_name, order in wallpaper_group_data.items():\n        if order == target_order:\n            matching_groups.append(group_name)\n\n    # Sort the list for consistent output\n    matching_groups.sort()\n\n    count = len(matching_groups)\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are:\")\n    print(\", \".join(matching_groups))\n    \n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(['1'] * count)\n    \n    print(\"\\nEach of these groups contributes 1 to the total count.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n    \ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
