    # --- Step 1: Analyze incorrect options ---
    print(f"Analysis of A ({options['A']}): This mechanism causes homologous gene copies to become more similar, which is the opposite of divergence. This is incorrect.")
    
    print(f"Analysis of B ({options['B']}): This is the process where one copy becomes a non-functional pseudogene. This represents a loss of one functional copy, not the retention of two distinct, functional genes. This is incorrect.")
    
    print(f"Analysis of E ({options['E']}): This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism operating on genes within a genome. This operates at the wrong biological level and is incorrect.")

    # --- Step 2: Analyze correct primary mechanisms ---
    print(f"\nAnalysis of C ({options['C']}): This is a valid model where one gene copy evolves a novel function. This explains both retention (the new function is beneficial) and divergence. It requires rarer gain-of-function mutations.")
    
    print(f"Analysis of D ({options['D']}): This is also a valid model where an ancestral gene's multiple functions are partitioned between the two copies after duplication. Both copies are then required. This explains retention and divergence and relies on more common loss-of-function mutations.")
    
    # --- Step 3: Conclude which is 'most likely' ---
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are the primary models explaining the long-term preservation of duplicate genes.")
    print("However, the Subfunctionalization model provides a powerful explanation for the crucial initial phase of retention. It relies on relatively common degenerative mutations (loss of sub-functions), which can 'rescue' both gene copies from being lost by making them jointly necessary.")
    print("Because it does not require a rare gain-of-function mutation to occur for preservation, it is considered a highly probable, and thus 'most likely,' mechanism for the retention and subsequent divergence of many gene duplicates.")
