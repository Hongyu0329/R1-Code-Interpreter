    "Of the provided options, both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are major accepted mechanisms for the retention of duplicated genes. To determine which is \"most likely,\" we can consider the underlying genetic changes required for each. My plan is to write a Python script that analyzes each option and explains the reasoning for selecting the most probable mechanism.\n\n1.  **Define the Problem**: State the question and the multiple-choice options within the script.\n2.  **Analyze Each Option**: Evaluate each choice based on established principles of molecular evolution.\n    *   **A. Gene conversion**: This process homogenizes genes, working against divergence. It is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization**: This is gene loss, not retention of two functional copies. It is incorrect in this context.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization**: This model proposes one copy gains a new function. It is a valid mechanism but requires relatively rare gain-of-function mutations.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization**: This model proposes that the original functions are partitioned between the two copies. It relies on more common loss-of-function mutations, making it a very probable way to preserve both copies initially.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation**: This is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level. It is incorrect.\n3.  **Compare and Conclude**: Compare the two valid models (C and D). Subfunctionalization provides a passive route for preserving both gene copies through common degenerative mutations, which can \"rescue\" duplicates from being lost. This makes it a very likely, and possibly more frequent, initial mechanism for gene retention than neofunctionalization, which requires a specific beneficial new function to evolve.\n4.  **Final Output**: The script will print the analysis and the final selected answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the mechanisms for duplicate gene retention\n    and selects the most likely one from the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"Analyzing the options step-by-step:\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze incorrect options ---\n    print(f\"Analysis of A ({options['A']}): This mechanism causes homologous gene copies to become more similar, which is the opposite of divergence.

Both copies are then required.
