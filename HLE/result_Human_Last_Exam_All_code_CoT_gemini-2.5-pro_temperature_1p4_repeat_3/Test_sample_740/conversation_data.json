    "My approach is to transform the given integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations and then apply the Fredholm alternative theorem.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The equation `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy K(x,y) u(y)` is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel is `K(x,y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Kernel**: Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the kernel can be written as a finite sum:\n    `K(x,y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n    This shows the kernel is \"degenerate\" or \"separable\".\n\n3.  **Discretize the Equation**: We can express the solution `u(x)` in terms of the kernel's structure. Let `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. The equation becomes a polynomial in `x`:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n    By substituting this form back into the definitions of `c_j`, we obtain a system of `n` linear equations for the coefficients `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`:\n    `c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j+n-k)`.\n    This can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where `A` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `A_{jk} = 1/(j+n-k)` and `b` is a vector with elements `b_j = 1/(j+1)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Fredholm Alternative**: A solution to `(I - λA)c = b` fails to exist if and only if:\n    a) `det(I - λA) = 0`. This means `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. Let's call the eigenvalues of `A` as `μ`. So, `λ = 1/μ`.\n    b) The vector `b` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix `(I - λA)ᵀ`.\n\n5.  **Simplify with a Symmetric Kernel**: The kernel `K(x,y)` is symmetric (`K(x,y) = K(y,x)`). This means the integral operator is self-adjoint. The condition for no solution simplifies: `λ` must be a characteristic value (`λ = 1/μ`), and the forcing function `f(x)=1` must not be orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction `v(x)`. That is, `∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx ≠ 0`.\n\n6.  **Find Eigenvalues and Check the Condition**: The eigenfunctions `v(x)` are polynomials of degree `n-1`, given by `v(x) ∝ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`, where `c` is the eigenvector of `A` corresponding to eigenvalue `μ = 1/λ`. The orthogonality condition `∫v(x)dx ≠ 0` translates to `Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (n-k) ≠ 0`.\n\n7.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script using `numpy` to:\n    a) Construct the matrix `A` for a given `n`.\n    b) Compute its eigenvalues `μ` and eigenvectors `c`.\n    c) For each eigenvalue, calculate the corresponding `λ = 1/μ`.\n    d) Check if the condition `Σ c_k/(n-k) ≠ 0` holds.\n    e) Print the values of `λ` for which no solution exists.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. You can change the value of `n` to find the corresponding values of `λ`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambdas_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution, for a specified integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return []\n\n    # Construct the matrix A, where A[j,k] = 1/(j+n-k)\n    A = np.fromfunction(lambda j, k: 1.0 / (j + n - k), (n, n), dtype=int)\n\n    # The integral operator is self-adjoint with respect to the L2 inner product.\n    # Its eigenvalues are real.
