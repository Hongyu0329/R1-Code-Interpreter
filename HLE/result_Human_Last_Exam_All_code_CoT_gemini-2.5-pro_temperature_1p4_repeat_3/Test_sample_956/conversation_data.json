    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the Group G**: First, I need to identify the group $G$ generated by the given permutations. I will use the `sympy` library in Python to construct this group. By computing its order and checking for simplicity, I can determine its isomorphism type. Given the action on 12 elements, it is likely a known group, such as a Mathieu group.\n2.  **Determine the Schur Multiplier A**: Once $G$ is identified, I will determine its Schur multiplier, denoted as $A$. The Schur multipliers for many common groups, especially the sporadic simple groups, are well-documented mathematical facts.\n3.  **Count Proper Subgroups of A**: Finally, I will analyze the subgroup structure of $A$. A proper subgroup is any subgroup that is not the group itself. I will find all proper subgroups of $A$ and then count how many of them there are up to isomorphism.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan and find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\n\ndef count_proper_subgroups_of_schur_multiplier():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the given permutation group, determines its Schur\n    multiplier, and counts the number of proper subgroups of the multiplier\n    up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the group G from its generators.\n    # The set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z}.
