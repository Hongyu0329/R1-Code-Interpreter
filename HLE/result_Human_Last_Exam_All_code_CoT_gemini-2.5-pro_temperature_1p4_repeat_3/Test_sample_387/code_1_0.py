# Step 1: Define the dimension of the original space P.
# The log point P has a log structure defined by the monoid N^3.
# This corresponds to the 3-dimensional affine space, so its dimension is 3.
dimension_of_P = 3

# Step 2: Apply the property of the blowup operation.
# The blowup of a space along a sub-ideal is a birational morphism,
# which means it preserves the dimension of the original space.
# So, the dimension of the log blowup is the same as the dimension of P.
dimension_of_log_blowup = dimension_of_P

# Step 3: Print the final equation and its result.
# The final equation is: Dimension of the log blowup = 3.
print("The dimension of the log blowup of P in I is:")
