    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then analyze the structures of African flags.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Danish Flag:** I will represent the Danish flag as a numerical matrix. The flag features a red field with a white Nordic cross. This design has variations along both its height and width, created by the horizontal and vertical bars of the cross. I will calculate the rank of this matrix, which represents the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns.\n2.  **Hypothesize Flag Structures:** I'll determine which geometric flag structures typically result in which ranks.\n    *   **Rank 1:** Flags with simple parallel stripes (either horizontal or vertical) can be described by a single basis vector for their rows (for vertical stripes) or columns (for horizontal stripes), making them rank 1.\n    *   **Rank 2:** Structures that introduce a second, linearly independent component often have a rank of 2. Examples include the Danish cross (one horizontal bar + one vertical bar), a field with a distinct canton (corner rectangle), or a striped field with a central emblem that breaks the simple striped pattern.\n3.  **Identify and Analyze African Flags:** I will search for African national flags that match the structural patterns identified for Rank 2.\n4.  **Write Python Code for Verification:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines simplified matrix representations for the Danish flag and the candidate African flags. I will use unique, non-zero numbers for each color to ensure the rank is maximal, as requested.\n    *   Uses the `numpy` library to calculate the matrix rank for each flag.\n    *   Prints the analysis for each flag, showing its matrix and calculated rank.\n    *   Compares the ranks to that of Denmark's flag and prints a final list of the African nations whose flags have the same rank.\n\nThe Danish flag, with its single horizontal and single vertical stripe, can be represented by two linearly independent row vectors: a row with the horizontal stripe `[white, white, white...]` and a row without it `[red, red, white, red...]`. These two vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, so the rank is 2. My task is to find African flags with a similar Rank-2 structure.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_flag_rank(name, matrix):\n    \"\"\"Calculates and prints the rank of a given flag matrix.\"\"\"\n    rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)\n    print(f\"--- {name} ---\")\n    print(\"Matrix representation:\")\n    print(matrix)\n    print(f\"The rank of the flag of {name} is {rank}.\\n\")\n    return rank\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies African nation flags with the same algebraic rank as Denmark's flag.\n    Colors are mapped to distinct integers (e.g., Red=1, White=2, Blue=3, etc.)\n    to ensure maximal rank.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
