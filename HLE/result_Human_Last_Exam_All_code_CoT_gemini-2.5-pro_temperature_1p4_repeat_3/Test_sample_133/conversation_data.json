    "An optimal move is one that leads to a win in the fastest way possible. This involves a two-step process:\n1.  First, check for any moves that result in an immediate win (placing the 4th piece in a line).\n2.  If no immediate wins are found, check for moves that create a \"forced win\" on the next turn. A common forced win is creating a double threat, such as a line of three pieces with open, playable ends on both sides, which the opponent cannot fully block in a single move.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Analyze the board for immediate wins:**\n*   **Horizontal:** The longest line of 'O's is `O O` in row 4 (`d4`, `e4`). To win on this turn, 'O' would need an existing `O O O` line, which is not present.\n*   **Vertical:** The longest vertical line of 'O's is `O O` in column d (`d5`, `d4`). Placing a piece at `d3` would create a line of three `O`'s, but not a winning four. No other column offers a vertical win.\n*   **Diagonal:** There is a line of `O O O` at `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`. To win, 'O' must place a piece at the next spot in the sequence, which is `f3`. However, looking at column `f`, there are already pieces in `f6` and `f5`. The next available space is `f4`. Since `f3` is not immediately playable, this is not an immediate win.\n\nSince there are no immediate wins, we proceed to the next step.\n\n**2. Analyze the board for forced wins:**\nA forced win can be set up by creating two threats simultaneously. Let's analyze the move `f4`.\n*   **Move:** Player 'O' places a token in column 'f'. It lands at `f4`.\n*   **Result:** This move places a third 'O' in row 4, creating the line `O O O` from `d4` to `f4`.\n*   **The Threat:** This `O-O-O` line at `d4-e4-f4` now has two open ends where a winning fourth piece can be placed: `c4` and `g4`.\n*   **Opponent's Dilemma:** It is now 'X's turn. To prevent 'O' from winning, 'X' must play in either column `c` (to block `c4`) or column `g` (to block `g4`). Both `c4` and `g4` are valid, open moves. 'X' can only choose one.\n*   **Guaranteed Win:** If 'X' blocks `c4`, 'O' will play `g4` on the next turn and win. If 'X' blocks `g4`, 'O' will play `c4` and win.\n\nTherefore, the move `f4` creates an unstoppable threat and guarantees a win for 'O' on their next turn. This is the fastest possible path to victory from the given board state.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connect4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given Connect 4 board to find the optimal move for 'O'.\n    The function checks for immediate wins and then for forced wins (next turn).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Board representation: 0,0 is bottom-left\n    # '.' is empty, 'X' and 'O' are players.\n    # The board is represented with rows 0-5 (bottom to top)\n    # and columns 0-6 (left to right).\n    board = [\n      ['X','O','O','X','X','O','X'],  # row 0 (board's row 6)\n      ['O','.','X','O','X','X','X'],  # row 1 (board's row 5)\n      ['.','.','.','O','O','.','.'],  # row 2 (board's row 4)\n      ['.','.','.','.','.','.','.'],  # row 3 (board's row 3)\n      ['.','.','.','.','.','.','.'],  # row 4 (board's row 2)\n      ['.','.','.','.','.','.','.']   # row 5 (board's row 1)\n    ]\n    ROWS = 6\n    COLS = 7\n    PLAYER = 'O'\n    OPPONENT = 'X'\n\n    def get_valid_moves(current_board):\n        \"\"\"Finds the next available row for each non-full column.\"\"\"\n        moves = []\n        for c in range(COLS):\n            for r in range(ROWS):\n                if current_board[r][c] == '.':\n                    moves.append((r, c))\n                    break\n        return moves\n\n    def check_win(current_board, player, r, c):\n        \"\"\"Checks if placing a piece at (r, c) results in a win.\"\"\"\n        # Horizontal\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(COLS):\n            if current_board[r][i] == player:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                count = 0\n            if count >= 4: return True\n        # Vertical\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(ROWS):\n            if current_board[i][c] == player:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                count = 0\n            if count >= 4: return True\n        # Diagonal /\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(-3, 4):\n            if 0 <= r + i < ROWS and 0 <= c + i < COLS:\n                if current_board[r + i][c + i] == player:\n                    count += 1\n                else:\n                    count = 0\n                if count >= 4: return True\n        # Diagonal \\\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(-3, 4):\n            if 0 <= r + i < ROWS and 0 <= c - i < COLS:\n                if current_board[r + i][c - i] == player:\n                    count += 1\n                else:\n                    count = 0\n                if count >= 4: return True\n        return False\n\n    # Step 1: Check for immediate winning moves\n    winning_moves = []\n    valid_moves = get_valid_moves(board)\n    for r, c in valid_moves:\n        temp_board = [row[:] for row in board]\n        temp_board[r][c] = PLAYER\n        if check_win(temp_board, PLAYER, r, c):\n            winning_moves.append((r, c))\n\n    if winning_moves:\n        # Convert to problem's notation (e.g., f4)\n        results = []\n        for r, c in winning_moves:\n            col_char = chr(ord('a') + c)\n            row_num = 6 - r\n            results.append(f\"{col_char}{row_num}\")\n        print(\", \".join(results))\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Check for forced wins on the next turn\n    forced_win_moves = []\n    for r1, c1 in valid_moves: # O's first move\n        board1 = [row[:] for row in board]\n        board1[r1][c1] = PLAYER\n        \n        # Assume this move leads to a win, unless opponent can prevent it\n        can_be_countered = False\n        \n        opponent_moves = get_valid_moves(board1)\n        if not opponent_moves: # Draw\n             continue\n\n        for r2, c2 in opponent_moves: # X's response\n            board2 = [row[:] for row in board1]\n            board2[r2][c2] = OPPONENT\n            \n            # Can O win on the next turn, regardless of X's move?\n            o_can_win_now = False\n            o_winning_responses = get_valid_moves(board2)\n            for r3, c3 in o_winning_responses:\n                board3 = [row[:] for row in board2]\n                board3[r3][c3] = PLAYER\n                if check_win(board3, PLAYER, r3, c3):\n                    o_can_win_now = True\n                    break\n            \n            if not o_can_win_now:\n                # X found a move to stop an immediate win from O\n                can_be_countered = True\n                break\n        \n        if not can_be_countered:\n            forced_win_moves.append((r1, c1))\n\n    if forced_win_moves:\n        results = []\n        for r, c in forced_win_moves:\n            col_char = chr(ord('a') + c)\n            row_num = 6 - r\n            results.append(f\"{col_char}{row_num}\")\n        print(\", \".join(results))\n        return\n\n    print(\"No optimal move to win found.\")\n\nsolve_connect4()\n```\n<<<f4>>>"
