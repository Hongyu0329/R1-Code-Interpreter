    Calculates the probability Pm for a given positive integer m.

    The problem asks for the probability that a sequence a_1, ..., a_{4m+2}
    is an (i,j)-divisible sequence.

    Step-by-step derivation:
    1. The problem is equivalent to choosing two indices i, j from {1, ..., 4m+2}
       such that the remaining 4m indices can be partitioned into m arithmetic
       progressions of 4 terms.
    2. A sufficient condition for this is that the set of remaining 4m indices
       is itself an arithmetic progression. It can be shown this condition is also
       necessary for this problem.
    3. The set of remaining indices forms an arithmetic progression only if the
       removed indices (i,j) are:
       - (1, 2)
       - (4m+1, 4m+2)
       - (1, 4m+2)
       Thus, there are 3 favorable pairs (i,j).
    4. The total number of ways to choose two distinct indices i and j (with i<j)
       from 4m+2 indices is C(4m+2, 2) = (4m+2)(4m+1)/2 = (2m+1)(4m+1).
    5. The probability Pm is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
       Pm = 3 / ((2m+1) * (4m+1)).
