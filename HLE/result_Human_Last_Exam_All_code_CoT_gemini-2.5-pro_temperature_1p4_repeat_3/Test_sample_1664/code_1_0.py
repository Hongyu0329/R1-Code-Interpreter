    print("A. moths behave erratically... - Incorrect. The poem is about dead, preserved moths, not their behavior.")
    print("B. scientific specimen preservation can lead to degradation - Correct. This aligns perfectly with the 'tarnished logic' where the act of preserving results in decay over time.")
