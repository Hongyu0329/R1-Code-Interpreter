Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Treatment with PD-1 Inhibitors:

1.  **Mechanism of Action:** PD-1 inhibitors are immunotherapy drugs that work by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Cancer cells can express a protein called PD-L1, which binds to the PD-1 receptor on immune T-cells, effectively 'switching them off' and preventing them from attacking the tumor. PD-1 inhibitors block this interaction, thus unleashing the T-cells against the cancer.

2.  **Importance of Biomarkers:** Because these drugs target the PD-L1 protein, their effectiveness is logically greatest in tumors that have a significant presence of this protein. Patients are often tested for PD-L1 expression levels to predict their response to this therapy. This is known as a predictive biomarker.

3.  **Clinical Trial Evidence:** Landmark clinical trials, such as KEYNOTE-355, have studied the effect of adding the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab to chemotherapy for metastatic TNBC. The results clearly showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients whose tumors were PD-L1-positive (specifically with a Combined Positive Score [CPS] >= 10).

4.  **Conclusion:** While some benefits might be observed in other groups for different metrics (like progression-free survival), the specific benefit of prolonged *overall survival* compared to chemotherapy alone is consistently and significantly demonstrated in the **PD-L1-positive population**.
