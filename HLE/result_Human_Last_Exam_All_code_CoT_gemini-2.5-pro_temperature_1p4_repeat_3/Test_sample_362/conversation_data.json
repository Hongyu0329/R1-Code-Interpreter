    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** First, I will identify the chemical structures of the two reactants: pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane.\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or ketone) with a phosphorus ylide. The core transformation is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom with the carbon group from the ylide, forming a C=C double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n3.  **Construct the Product:** I will combine the tert-butyl group from pivalaldehyde (`(CH3)3C-CH=`) and the carbon chain from the ylide (`=CH-CH2-(2-chlorophenyl)`) to form the new alkene structure.\n4.  **Determine Stereochemistry:** Wittig reactions with unstabilized ylides (like the one in this problem) predominantly form the Z-isomer (cis) of the alkene. I will analyze the substituents on the new double bond to assign the correct stereochemistry.\n5.  **Name the Product:** Using IUPAC nomenclature rules, I will determine the systematic name of the resulting alkene, including its (Z)- stereochemical descriptor.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that defines the reactants and products by name and prints out the full reaction equation, clearly stating the major organic product.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and displays the product of a specified Wittig reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the reactants based on the problem description.\n    # The Wittig reaction involves an aldehyde and a phosphorus ylide.\n    aldehyde = \"pivalaldehyde\"\n    wittig_reagent = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n\n    # Step 3, 4, & 5: Determine the products of the reaction.\n    # The reaction forms an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n    # The ylide is unstabilized, leading to the (Z)-isomer as the major product.\n    # The IUPAC name is derived from the combined structure: (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(2-chlorophenyl)\n    # The main chain is a pent-2-ene, with substituents at positions 1 and 4.\n    major_product = \"(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n    byproduct = \"triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n\n    # Print the full reaction equation, showing all components.\n    # This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    # by printing the full IUPAC names which contain numbers.\n    print(\"The Wittig reaction occurs as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{aldehyde} + {wittig_reagent} ---> {major_product} + {byproduct}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"The major organic product of the reaction is: {major_product}\")\n\nsolve_wittig_reaction()\n```\n<<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
