    The question asks for the property equivalent to a map f: X -> Y being continuous, expressed in the language of nonstandard analysis.

    1.  **Core Principle:** The fundamental connection between standard topology and nonstandard analysis is that a standard function `f` is continuous at a standard point `x_0` if and only if it maps points infinitesimally close to `x_0` to points infinitesimally close to `f(x_0)`. To say `f` is continuous on its domain `X` means this property must hold for all standard points `x_0` in `X`.

    2.  **Analyzing Option B:** Let's denote "a is infinitesimally close to b" by `a ~ b`. Option B states:
        `forall x_0 in X, forall x_1 in X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ==> f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)`
        This statement perfectly captures the principle described above. The `forall x_0 in X` ensures the condition holds at every standard point, thus defining continuity for the entire map `f`. This is the textbook nonstandard definition of continuity.

    3.  **Why Option C is Incorrect:** Option C states:
        `forall x_0, x_1 in X*: x_0 ~ x_1 ==> f(x_0) ~ f(x_1)`
        This condition is stronger. It demands that `f` preserves infinitesimal closeness for *all* points in the nonstandard extension `X*`, including "infinite" points that are not close to any standard point. This property is known as S-continuity, and it is equivalent to the standard property of **uniform continuity**. Since not all continuous functions are uniformly continuous (e.g., `f(x) = x^2` on the set of real numbers), C is not equivalent to continuity in general.

    4.  **Other Options:**
        -   A is trivial for standard points.
        -   D relates to injectivity, not continuity.
        -   E and F are converses of B and C, respectively, and are false for simple continuous functions like constant maps.

    Therefore, B is the correct choice.
