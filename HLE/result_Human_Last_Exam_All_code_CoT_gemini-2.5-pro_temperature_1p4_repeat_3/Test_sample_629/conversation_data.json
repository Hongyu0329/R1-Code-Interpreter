    "To solve this problem, we need to delve into the mathematical field of knot theory, specifically the representation of knots as grid diagrams.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:**\n    *   A **grid diagram** represents a knot on an n x n grid. The **grid number** is this value 'n'. The minimal grid number for a given knot is the smallest 'n' for which a diagram exists. For the trefoil knot (both left- and right-handed), the minimal grid number is 3.\n    *   A grid diagram on an n x n grid is defined by two permutations, `σ` (sigma) and `τ` (tau), of `{1, 2, ..., n}`. We can represent these permutations as lists. For a 3x3 grid, a permutation like `[2, 3, 1]` means `1->2`, `2->3`, `3->1`.\n    *   The problem asks for the number of unique diagrams for the **left-hand trefoil knot** up to **translation and rotation**.\n\n2.  **Identify Symmetry Operations:**\n    *   **Translation** corresponds to cyclically shifting the rows and columns of the grid. This preserves the knot type.\n    *   **Rotation** of the grid is a geometric operation. A 90-degree rotation transforms a diagram `(σ, τ)` into a new diagram `(σ', τ')`. We need to determine the formula for this transformation. A 90-degree clockwise rotation sends a point `(i, j)` to `(j, n+1-i)`. For permutations, this transforms `(σ, τ)` to `(sτ, σs)`, where `s` is the reversing permutation `s(i) = n+1-i`.\n    *   Crucially, we must recognize that while translation preserves the knot's handedness (left or right), rotation may not.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Let's start with a known minimal grid diagram for the right-hand trefoil, `D_R`. It is given by `σ = [2, 3, 1]` and `τ = [2, 3, 1]`.\n    *   We will apply 90-degree rotations repeatedly and track the resulting diagrams. For `n=3`, the reversing permutation is `s = [3, 2, 1]`.\n    *   We will then identify which of the diagrams in the rotational orbit represent the left-hand trefoil. A known result states that the mirror image of a right-hand trefoil diagram gives a left-hand trefoil diagram. Rotations of 90 and 270 degrees act like reflections and also change the handedness.\n    *   Finally, we count the number of resulting left-hand trefoil diagrams that are not equivalent to each other via the allowed symmetries (translation and rotation). Two diagrams are rotationally equivalent if they are in the same rotation orbit. They are translationally equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by cyclically shifting rows/columns.\n\n4.  **Python Implementation:**\n    *   The code will define the initial diagram and the permutation operations.\n    *   It will then calculate the orbit of the initial diagram under 90-degree rotation.\n    *   It will identify and print the diagrams that correspond to the left-hand trefoil.\n    *   By analyzing the properties of these diagrams, we can determine if they are equivalent, leading to the final count.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compose_perms(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition of two permutations p1 o p2.\"\"\"\n    return tuple(p1[i] for i in p2)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot\n    up to translation and rotation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use 0-based indexing for permutations of {0, 1, 2} for simplicity.\n    # The right-hand trefoil can be represented by the diagram D_R = (sigma, tau).\n    # sigma = 2,3,1 -> (1,2,0)\n    # tau   = 2,3,1 -> (1,2,0)\n    d_r = ((1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 0))\n\n    # The reversing permutation s(i) = n-1-i.
