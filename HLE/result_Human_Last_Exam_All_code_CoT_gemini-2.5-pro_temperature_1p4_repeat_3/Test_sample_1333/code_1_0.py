    Calculates the maximum possible value of Chi(D)/Chi(D_N) for a regular dessin D.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  The ratio of the Euler characteristics Chi(D)/Chi(D_N) is first simplified using the
        definitions of the Euler characteristic for a regular dessin and its quotient dessin.
    2.  This simplification shows the ratio is equal to |N|, the order of the normal subgroup N.
    3.  The problem then becomes finding the maximum possible value of |N|.
    4.  The "smooth covering" condition implies that N acts freely on the surface of D.
    5.  Based on known theorems in the theory of regular maps on surfaces, the maximum
        order for such a freely acting normal subgroup N is 4.

    # Step 1-3: The ratio Chi(D)/Chi(D_N) simplifies to |N|.
    # The problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of |N|.
    # Let max_val be this maximum value.
