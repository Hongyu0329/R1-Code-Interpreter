def solve_pale_fire_riddle():
    """
    This function solves the three-part riddle about Nabokov's "Pale Fire".
    
    Part (A): The allusion is to a trick worthy of Professor Moriarty in "The Final Problem."
    The faking of evidence to mislead the detective is a hallmark of his methods.
    The number for this choice is 3.

    Part (B): The theme underscored by misleading tracks is the "impossibility of reliable inference."
    This is a central theme in Pale Fire, as Kinbote's entire commentary is an exercise in unreliable inference.
    The number for this choice is 6.
    
    Part (C): The work during which Nabokov most pervasively experienced "intricate back-referencing"
    was his massive, multi-volume annotated translation of Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin."
    The number for this choice is 7.

    The sum of these numbers is 3 + 6 + 7 = 16, which is a multiple of 8.
