# Step 1: Define the numbers based on historical facts about Minsk.
# X is the building number of the former exhibition hall at Yanki Kupaly st.
X = 27
# Y is the number of the tram route that passed through Kastryƒçnickaja st.
Y = 7

# Step 2: Calculate X to the power of Y.
result = X ** Y

# Step 3: Print the full equation and the final answer.
print(f"The number of the exhibition hall (X) is {X}.")
print(f"The tram route number (Y) is {Y}.")
print(f"The calculation is {X}^{Y}.")
print(f"The result of {X}^{Y} is: {result}")
