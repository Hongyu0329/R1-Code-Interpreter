    "To find a closed form for the given sum, we will employ the method of generating functions. The overall plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the sum**: The sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$ is a convolution of two sequences, $c_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $a_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ (with $a_{n-k}$ being the second term). The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of the generating functions for these sequences.\n2.  **Define Generating Functions (GFs)**: Let $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k$ and $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k x^k$. The generating function for $S_n$ is $S(x) = C(x)A(x)$, and we need to find $S_n = [x^n]S(x)$.\n3.  **Find the GFs**: The GF for $a_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is a well-known result: $A(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$. To find $C(x)$, we can observe that the term $(2k+1)$ corresponds to applying an operator $\\mathcal{D} = 2x \\frac{d}{dx} + 1$ to the generating function. Specifically, if $F(x) = \\sum f_k x^k$, then $\\mathcal{D}F(x) = \\sum (2k+1)f_k x^k$. We can obtain $C(x)$ by applying this operator five times to $A(x)$, so $C(x) = \\mathcal{D}^5 A(x)$.\n4.  **Compute the result**: We will use a symbolic computation library, `sympy` in Python, to perform the repeated differentiation and algebraic simplifications. The product $S(x) = C(x)A(x)$ will turn out to be a rational function of the form $P(x)(1-4x)^{-6}$, where $P(x)$ is a polynomial.\n5.  **Extract the coefficient**: The coefficient of $x^n$ in $(1-4x)^{-m}$ is $4^n \\binom{n+m-1}{m-1}$. By expanding the expression for $S(x)$, we can find a formula for $S_n$.\n6.  **Simplify and format**: The resulting formula will be a sum of several binomial terms. We will simplify this into a single polynomial expression in terms of $n$, written in the basis of binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan to derive the final closed-form expression for the sum.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a closed form for the sum S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k,k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    using the method of generating functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the symbolic variable x and n\n    x, n = sympy.symbols('x n')\n\n    # The generating function for the central binomial coefficients C(2k, k) is A0.\n    A0 = 1 / sympy.sqrt(1 - 4*x)\n\n    # Define the operator D = 2x * d/dx + 1.
