    - Regulation Check: JPMorgan Chase is a foreign (U.S.) bank, not a Canadian Schedule I or II bank. It does not qualify for the specific bank exemption in the Ontario Securities Act for a broad distribution to the public.

    - Investor Details: Salary = $35,000; Net Assets = $10,000.
    - Regulation Check: The most common exemption for such an investor would be the 'accredited investor' exemption. As of Jan 2020, this required, for example, net financial assets over $1 million or annual income over $200,000. This investor does not qualify. No other common exemption applies.

'Caisse populaire acadienne ltée' is a network based in New Brunswick and regulated under New Brunswick law.
