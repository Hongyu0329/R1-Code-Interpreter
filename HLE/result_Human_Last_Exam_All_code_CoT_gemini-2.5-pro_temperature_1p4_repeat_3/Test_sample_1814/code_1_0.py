    # The problem asks for the largest possible number of distinct topologies
    # generated by iterating the 'dual' operator, let's call it kappa.
    
    # Let T_n = kappa^n(T) be the n-th iteration.
    
    # A key theorem in general topology states that for any topology T,
    # the operator kappa satisfies the following identity:
    # kappa^5(T) = kappa^3(T)
    
    # This identity limits the number of distinct topologies that can be generated.
    # The sequence of potentially distinct topologies is:
    # T_0, T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4

    # T_5 = kappa^5(T) = T_3
    # T_6 = kappa(T_5) = kappa(T_3) = T_4
    # ... and so on.
    
    # The set of distinct topologies is a subset of {T_0, T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4}.
    # Therefore, the maximum possible number of distinct topologies is 5.
