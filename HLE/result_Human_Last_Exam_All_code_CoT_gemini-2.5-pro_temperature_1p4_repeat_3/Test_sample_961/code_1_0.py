# Step 2: Define the known value for the stable commutator length (scl) of a
# single commutator c_i = [a_i, b_i] in a free group F_i.
# scl_Fi(c_i) = 1/2
scl_of_single_commutator = 0.5

# Step 3: Calculate the scl of one powered commutator c_i^30 within its subgroup F_i.
# We use the property scl(g^n) = |n| * scl(g).
scl_of_powered_commutator = power * scl_of_single_commutator

# Step 4: Calculate the total scl in the free product group G.
# Scl is additive over free products, so we sum the scl of each component.
# Since all components are identical, this is equivalent to multiplying by the number of groups.
total_scl = num_groups * scl_of_powered_commutator

# Step 5: Print the final equation showing the calculation.
# We cast the results to integers for a clean output.
