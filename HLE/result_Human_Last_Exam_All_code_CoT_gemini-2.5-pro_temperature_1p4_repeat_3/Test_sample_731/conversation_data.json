    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** A semidihedral group of size `2^n` is denoted `SD_n`. Since the size is 512, and `512 = 2^9`, we are dealing with the group `SD_9`.\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup `H` of a group `G` is a subgroup that can be formed by taking all the `k`-th powers of elements in `G`, i.e., `H = {g^k | g âˆˆ G}` for some integer `k`.\n3.  **Simplify the Problem:** For any finite p-group (a group whose order is a power of a prime `p`), the distinct power subgroups are obtained by taking powers of `p`. In our case, `p=2`, so we only need to analyze the subgroups `G^(2^j)` for `j = 0, 1, 2, ...`.\n4.  **Analyze the Structure of SD_9:** The group `SD_9` has the presentation `<a, b | a^256 = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^127>`.\n    *   It contains a cyclic subgroup `<a>` of order 256.\n    *   The other 256 elements are of the form `ba^i`, which have an order of 2 or 4.\n5.  **Compute and Count the Power Subgroups:** We will systematically compute the subgroups `G^(2^j)` and count how many unique ones we find.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_order} is denoted as SD_{n}, since {group_order} = 2^{n}.\")\n    print(\"A 'power subgroup' is a subgroup formed by the set of k-th powers of all elements in the group.\")\n    print(\"For a 2-group like SD_n, we only need to consider powers of 2 (i.e., k = 2^j) to find all distinct power subgroups.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet the presentation of SD_9 be <a, b | a^256=1, b^2=1, bab=a^127>.\")\n    print(\"The power subgroups are computed as follows:\\n\")\n\n    # j=0, k=1\n    print(\"1.
