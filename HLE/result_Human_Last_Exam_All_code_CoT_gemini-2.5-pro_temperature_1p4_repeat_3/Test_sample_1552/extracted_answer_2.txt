The local density of the second heat kernel coefficient, a_2(x), is given by the formula:
a_2(x) = (-19*N_F/45) * R_μνρσ^2 + (4*N_F/5) * R_μν^2 + (-83*N_F/540) * R^2 + (-1/3) * tr(F_μν*F^μν)

Where:
 - N_F is the dimension of the gauge representation of the spinor field.
 - R_μνρσ^2, R_μν^2, R^2 are the squares of the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and Ricci scalar, respectively.
 - tr(F_μν*F^μν) is the trace of the squared gauge field strength, which for a semi-simple gauge group is Tr(T^a T^b)F_μν^a F_b^μν.
