# The scientific literature describing the skull of Irritator challengeri
# notes the presence of depressions (specifically, pneumatic foramina)
# within a feature called the lacrimal recess.

# Based on descriptions of the holotype specimen, we can identify the count.
number_of_depressions = 2

# The request asks to show each number in a final equation.
# We can represent the total as a sum of its parts.
part_1 = 1
part_2 = 1
total = part_1 + part_2
