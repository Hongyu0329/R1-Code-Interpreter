    "To determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*, I will retrieve this specific anatomical detail from my knowledge base, which is informed by paleontological research papers describing the species' skull.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the specific anatomical feature in question: the lacrimal recess of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  Access my internal knowledge based on the scientific literature, primarily the detailed description of the skull.\n3.  The scientific description states there are two large pneumatic foramina (depressions) within this recess.\n4.  I will write a Python script to present this finding. The script will state the number of depressions and, as requested, show a simple equation that results in the final number.\n\n```python\n# The scientific literature describing the skull of Irritator challengeri\n# notes the presence of depressions (specifically, pneumatic foramina)\n# within a feature called the lacrimal recess.\n\n# Based on descriptions of the holotype specimen, we can identify the count.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# The request asks to show each number in a final equation.\n# We can represent the total as a sum of its parts.\npart_1 = 1\npart_2 = 1\ntotal = part_1 + part_2\n\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions (pneumatic foramina).\")\nprint(f\"This can be represented as: {part_1} + {part_2} = {total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
