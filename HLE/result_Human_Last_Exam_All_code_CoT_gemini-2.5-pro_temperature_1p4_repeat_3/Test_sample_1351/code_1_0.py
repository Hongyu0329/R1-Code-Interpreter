    Solves the theoretical problem about (3,2)-stingray duos in GL_5(4).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    Let V be the vector space F_q^d.
    d=5, q=4, e1=3, e2=2.
    g1 is a 3-stingray: dim(U1)=3, dim(F1)=2, where U1=im(g1-1), F1=ker(g1-1).
    g2 is a 2-stingray: dim(U2)=2, dim(F2)=3, where U2=im(g2-1), F2=ker(g2-1).
    (g1, g2) is a (3,2)-stingray duo, so U1 intersect U2 = {0}.
    Since dim(U1) + dim(U2) = 3 + 2 = 5 = d, we have V = U1 (+) U2.

    (a) Is the pair irreducible?
    The answer is No. Any such pair is reducible. A proof sketch:
    1. Assume H = <g1, g2> is irreducible. By Scott's theorem, an irreducible primitive subgroup of GL(d,q)
       cannot contain elements with a fixed space larger than d/2 (with few exceptions that do not apply).
       Here, dim(F2) = 3 > d/2 = 2.5. So H cannot be primitive.
    2. Thus, if H is irreducible, it must be imprimitive. Since d=5 is prime, this means H must be a monomial group,
       preserving a decomposition V = W1 (+) ... (+) W5 with dim(Wi)=1.
    3. The action of g1 and g2 on {W1,...,W5} are permutations pi1, pi2 in S5. For H to be irreducible,
       the group <pi1, pi2> must be transitive.
    4. The dimension of the fixed space of gi is bounded by the number of fixed points of pi_i.
       So, 2 = dim(F1) <= |Fix(pi1)| and 3 = dim(F2) <= |Fix(pi2)|.
    5. A permutation in S5 with >=3 fixed points must be a transposition (or id). A permutation with >=2 fixed points
       must be a 3-cycle or transposition (or id).
    6. No pair of such permutations can generate a transitive subgroup of S5. This is a contradiction.
    7. Therefore, the initial assumption is false, and H = <g1, g2> must be reducible.

    (b) Which conditions cause reducibility?
    The argument in (a) shows that any such pair must be reducible. The question implies this reducibility is
    always caused by one of the listed conditions. Each of the conditions is a sufficient reason for reducibility:
    (1) F1 intersect F2 != {0}: This intersection is a subspace fixed by both g1 and g2.
    (2) U1 = F2: g2 acts as identity on U1. Since U1 is g1-invariant, U1 is a common invariant subspace.
    (3) U2 = F1: g1 acts as identity on U2. Since U2 is g2-invariant, U2 is a common invariant subspace.
    Without a proof that one of these must always hold, we rely on the problem's framing that these are the reasons.
    Given the certainty of reducibility, it's implied at least one must hold.

    (c) What is the proportion of irreducible duos?
    From (a), the number of irreducible duos is 0. So the proportion is 0.
