    "This problem can be solved by understanding the fundamental constraints of the N-Queens problem. Here is the step-by-step plan to find the maximum number `m`.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Constraint:** The problem requires placing queens on a 16x16 chessboard such that no queen attacks another. The rules of attack for a queen (same row, same column, or same diagonal) are independent of the queen's color. Therefore, we can treat all queens as being of the same type for placement purposes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Maximum Total Queens:** For any N x N chessboard, the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed is N. This is due to the Pigeonhole Principle: if you try to place N+1 queens, at least two must share the same row, causing them to attack each other. For a 16x16 board, the maximum total number of non-attacking queens is 16.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equation:** The problem states there are `m` white queens and `m` black queens. This means the total number of queens on the board is `m + m`, which simplifies to `2 * m`.\n\n4.  **Solve for `m`:** Since the maximum total number of queens is 16, we can set up the equation: `2 * m = 16`. Solving this equation for `m` will give us the maximum number of queens of each color.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this logic and print the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m of white/black queens on a 16x16 board.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Size of the chessboard\n    N = 16\n\n    # On an N x N board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is N.\n    max_total_queens = N\n\n    # The total number of queens is m (white) + m (black) = 2 * m.\n    # We set this equal to the maximum possible number of queens.\n    # Equation: 2 * m = max_total_queens\n    # We solve for m.\n    m = max_total_queens // 2\n    \n    # --- Output the reasoning and the final answer ---\n    print(f\"The size of the chessboard is {N}x{N}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum total number of non-attacking queens on this board is {max_total_queens}.\")\n    print(\"We have 'm' white queens and 'm' black queens, for a total of 2 * m queens.\")\n    print(\"To find the maximum value for 'm', we set up the following equation:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with each number, as requested.\n    num_queen_colors = 2\n    print(f\"{num_queen_colors} * m = {max_total_queens}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSolving for m:\")\n    print(f\"m = {max_total_queens} / {num_queen_colors}\")\n    print(f\"m = {m}\")\n\nsolve_queen_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
