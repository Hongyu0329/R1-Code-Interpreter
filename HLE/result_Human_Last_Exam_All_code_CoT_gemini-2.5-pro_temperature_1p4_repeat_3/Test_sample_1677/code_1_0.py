    C. Increased demand for re-learning by working adults: This is a correct contributing factor.
    D. Diversification of higher education... acting as prep schools: This is an inappropriate
       characterization of the role of these institutions and not a primary driver.
    E. Government policies: This is a correct explanation for the increased supply of university places.
