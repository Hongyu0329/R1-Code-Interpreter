    "Based on StarCraft lore, the Second Great War begins in the year 2504 with the start of the Wings of Liberty campaign and concludes in 2508 with the end of the Legacy of the Void epilogue.\n\nTo calculate the duration, we subtract the start year from the end year.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore started in 2504.\nstart_year = 2504\n\n# The war concluded with the defeat of Amon in the epilogue of Legacy of the Void in 2508.\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration in years.\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The problem asks to round up the result.\n# Since the result is a whole number, rounding it up does not change the value.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The duration of the Second Great War is calculated as: {end_year} - {start_year} = {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
