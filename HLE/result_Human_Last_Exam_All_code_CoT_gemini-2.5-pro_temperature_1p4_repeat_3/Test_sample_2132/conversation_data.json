    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction**: The starting material is 2-chlorocyclohexanone, and the reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement.\n2.  **Determine the Product**: The Favorskii rearrangement of a cyclic alpha-halo ketone results in a ring contraction. In this case, 2-chlorocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n3.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity**: This is a topological index calculated from the molecular graph (which only considers non-hydrogen atoms). The formula is:\n    BC = (N_b² - Σ(δᵢ²)) / N_b²\n    where:\n    *   `N_b` is the total number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms (treating multiple bonds as single edges).\n    *   `δᵢ` (delta) is the degree of a non-hydrogen atom `i` (i.e., the number of other non-hydrogen atoms it is bonded to).\n    *   `Σ(δᵢ²)` is the sum of the squares of the degrees of all non-hydrogen atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the Index**:\n    *   I will represent the product, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, as a graph of its non-hydrogen atoms.\n    *   I will count the number of bonds (`N_b`) and determine the degree (`δᵢ`) for each of the 8 non-hydrogen atoms (6 carbons and 2 oxygens).\n    *   Finally, I will plug these values into the formula to calculate the complexity index.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step of the process.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bottcher_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the product of the\n    Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the product and represent its molecular graph.\n    # The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.
