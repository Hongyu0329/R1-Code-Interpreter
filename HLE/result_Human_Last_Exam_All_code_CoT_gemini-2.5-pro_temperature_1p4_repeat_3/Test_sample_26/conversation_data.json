    "This problem requires concepts from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry to solve. I will outline the logical steps to determine the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the setup:** Identify the properties of $X$, a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n2.  **Use topological tools:** The key is the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. This relates the homotopy groups of $X$ to those of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ and the relative homotopy groups of the pair.\n3.  **Relate homotopy to homology:** The Relative Hurewicz Theorem will be used to connect the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ to the relative homology groups $H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. This is crucial because homology groups are often easier to compute.\n4.  **Compute relative homology:** The long exact sequence of homology for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ will allow us to compute the necessary relative homology group, $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n5.  **Synthesize and conclude:** By combining the results from the previous steps, we can deduce the structure of $\\pi_3(X)$ and find its rank.\n\nThe python code below will walk through these steps to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a smooth\n    quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\n\n    The method follows these steps:\n    1.  The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair (CP^3, X) shows\n        that pi_3(X) is a quotient group of pi_4(CP^3, X). This implies\n        rank(pi_3(X)) <= rank(pi_4(CP^3, X)).\n    2.  The Hurewicz Theorem for pairs is used to relate the homotopy group\n        pi_4(CP^3, X) to the homology group H_4(CP^3, X).\n    3.  The long exact sequence of homology for the pair (CP^3, X) is used\n        to compute H_4(CP^3, X).\n    4.  Putting these facts together allows us to determine the rank.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    d = 5  # Degree of the hypersurface\n    n = 3  # Dimension of the ambient projective space CP^n\n\n    print(\"Let X be a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of the hypersurface is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The ambient space is CP^n where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the rank of the third homotopy group, pi_3(X).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair (CP^3, X)\")\n    print(\"The relevant part of this sequence is:\")\n    print(\"... -> pi_4(CP^3, X) --d--> pi_3(X) --i_*--> pi_3(CP^3) -> ...\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of the sequence\")\n    print(\"It is a standard result that pi_3(CP^3) is the trivial group, {0}.\")\n    print(\"This is because the fibration S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3 gives an isomorphism pi_3(CP^3) = pi_3(S^7), and pi_k(S^m) = 0 for k < m.\")\n    print(\"Since the map i_* goes to the zero group, it must be the zero map.\")\n    print(\"By the exactness of the sequence, the image of the map 'd' must equal the kernel of the map 'i_*'.\")\n    print(\"The kernel of the zero map is its entire domain, so ker(i_*) = pi_3(X).\")\n    print(\"Thus, the map d: pi_4(CP^3, X) -> pi_3(X) is surjective (onto).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Relating the ranks\")\n    print(\"Because there is a surjection from pi_4(CP^3, X) to pi_3(X), the rank of pi_3(X) is at most the rank of pi_4(CP^3, X).\")\n    print(\"rank(pi_3(X)) <= rank(pi_4(CP^3, X))\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Using the Relative Hurewicz Theorem\")\n    print(\"The pair (CP^3, X) is 2-connected.
