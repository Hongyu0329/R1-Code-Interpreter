    Analyzes the properties of the set S based on mathematical reasoning.

    The problem defines a function f and a set S. Based on the analysis:
    - S is always Open. For any x in S, there is a ball B(x, e) on which f is an
      isometry. Any y in B(x, e) is also in S because a smaller ball around y can
      be found inside B(x, e).
    - S is always Dense. This can be shown by proving that its complement cannot
      contain any open set. This relies on theorems stating that if a function
      preserves distances from a single point in a neighborhood, it must be a
      full isometry on that neighborhood (for n>=2), or on properties of
      functions of bounded variation (for n=1).

    The other properties are not always true, as demonstrated by counterexamples:
    - Not always Closed: f(x)=|x| on R gives S = R\{0}.
    - Not always Connected: f(x)=|x| on R gives S = R\{0}.
    - Not always Compact: If f(x)=x, S=R^n, which is not bounded.
    - Not always Connected complement: f(x)=dist(x, Z) gives a non-connected complement.
    - Not always Trivial first singular homology group: f(x)=|x| on R, S is not connected.
      To have non-trivial H1 for a connected S, one could consider S = R^2\{0},
      but it turns out that for n>=2, S must be R^n. However, we need properties
      that are *always* true, for *any* n.
