    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is Mount Athos.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the answer:\n1.  First, compile a list of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus. These include Mount Ida (the one near Troy, now Kaz Dağı), Mount Samothrace (now Fengari), Mount Athos, Mount Pelion, and Mount Ossa.\n2.  Next, find the modern-day elevations of these mountains.\n3.  Finally, compare their elevations to identify the highest peak among them.\n\nThe Python code below will store these mountains and their elevations, then iterate through them to find and print the tallest one.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, besides Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of historical mountains from the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Mount Olympus is excluded as per the prompt.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace (Fengari)\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Ossa\": 1978,\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of mountains mentioned in the Iliad (other than Olympus):\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the tallest mountain found so far\n    tallest_mountain_name = \"\"\n    max_elevation = 0\n\n    # Print each mountain and its elevation, and find the maximum\n    for name, elevation in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"{name}: {elevation} meters\")\n        if elevation > max_elevation:\n            max_elevation = elevation\n            tallest_mountain_name = name\n\n    print(f\"\\nAfter comparing the heights, the tallest mountain is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {max_elevation} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
