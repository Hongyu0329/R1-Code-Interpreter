    "To find the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3, we need to understand the definitions and then check groups for this property.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   A **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset where for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including `a=b`), their product `a*b` is not in `S`. In other words, `S * S` and `S` are disjoint.\n    *   A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` in `G` that is not in `S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n2.  **Formulate a computational check:**\n    For a given finite group `G`, we can determine if it has such a set by following these steps:\n    a. Iterate through all possible subsets `S` of `G` of size 3.\n    b. For each subset `S`, first verify if it is product-free. If not, discard it.\n    c. If `S` is product-free, then check if it is maximal. To do this, iterate through every element `g` in `G \\ S` (the elements of `G` not in `S`). For each `g`, form the set `S' = S ∪ {g}` and check if `S'` is product-free. If we find even one `g` for which `S'` remains product-free, then `S` is not maximal, and we discard it.\n    d. If a product-free set `S` survives this maximality test (i.e., for all `g` in `G \\ S`, `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free), then we have found a maximal product-free set of size 3 in group `G`.\n\n3.  **Execute the plan:**\n    This problem has been studied in combinatorial group theory. Based on published results, there is a finite number of such groups. I will write a Python script to implement the computational check described above on the groups identified by research in this area to verify the result. The script will be self-contained and will construct the necessary groups and their multiplication (Cayley) tables before performing the check. The groups checked will be `S_3`, `C_9`, `C_3 x C_3`, `A_4`, and the dicyclic group of order 12, `Q_12`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nclass Group:\n    \"\"\"A class to represent a finite group using its Cayley table.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name, order, table):\n        self.name = name\n        self.order = order\n        self.elements = list(range(order))\n        self.table = table\n\n    def multiply(self, a, b):\n        \"\"\"Computes the product of two elements using the Cayley table.\"\"\"\n        return self.table[a][b]\n\n    def has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_3(self):\n        \"\"\"Checks if the group has a maximal product-free set of size 3.\"\"\"\n        if self.order < 3:\n            return False\n\n        # Iterate through all subsets of size 3\n        for s_tuple in itertools.combinations(self.elements, 3):\n            s = set(s_tuple)\n\n            # 1.
