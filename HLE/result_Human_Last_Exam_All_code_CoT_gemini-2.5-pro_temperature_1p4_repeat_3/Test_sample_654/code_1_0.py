    This function is a placeholder for the user to input p, k, and n.
    For the purpose of this response, we'll use example values
    and compute the final expression based on the derivation.

    Let p be an odd prime.
    Let k, m be positive integers. The problem states m>=1, but it is denoted n in the formula.
    We are asked to compute the number of coefficients not divisible by p^k.
    The final expression derived from number theory is 2 * p**n.
