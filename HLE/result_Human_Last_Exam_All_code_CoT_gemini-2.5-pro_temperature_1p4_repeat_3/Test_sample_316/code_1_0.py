# The problem is to find a critical exponent for a restriction estimate
# related to the cone in the 3-dimensional real space R^3.

# According to the theory of Fourier restriction estimates, the critical exponents
# are values of 'p' where the geometric nature of the extremizing functions changes.
# The problem states one critical exponent is 4.

# The other critical exponent was determined by Larry Guth in his work on the
# restriction conjecture. The formula for the critical exponent in d-dimensional
# space is given by p_c = 2*(d+2)/d.

# For our problem, the ambient space is R^3, so we set the dimension d = 3.
d = 3

# Now, we can write down the equation for the critical exponent p.
# The equation is: p * d = 2 * (d + 2)
p_numerator = 2 * (d + 2)
p_denominator = d

# Calculate the value of the critical exponent.
p_critical = p_numerator / p_denominator

# Print the final equation and the result.

print("The final equation is:")
print(f"p * {d} = {p_numerator}")
print(f"p = {p_numerator} / {p_denominator}")
print(f"The other critical exponent is: {p_critical}")
