    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry to identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring. At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are three identical, large, and chiral substituents. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry, passing through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry makes the three large \"arms\" of the molecule chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in one of these arms and on the central core.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:**\n    *   **Mesitylene Methyls (-CH3):** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 of the benzene ring are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Linker Methylenes (-CH2-):** The three methylene groups linking the benzene ring to the substituents are also equivalent by symmetry. However, each -CH2- group is adjacent to a chiral center (the substituent). This makes the two protons within each methylene group diastereotopic, meaning they are non-equivalent. Thus, the methylene groups will give rise to two distinct signals.\n\n3.  **Count Signals from one Chiral Substituent:** The substituent is `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`. This is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system derived from camphor. Due to its chirality and lack of internal symmetry, all its protons are expected to be chemically non-equivalent, except for protons within the same methyl group.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups in the camphor-like skeleton. They are all in unique chemical environments and will produce three separate signals.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole system. This gives one signal.\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton:** There is one proton at a bridgehead of the bicyclic system. This gives one signal.\n    *   **Ring Methylene Protons:** There are two CH2 groups in the six-membered ring of the bicyclic system. In this rigid, chiral environment, all four protons of these two CH2 groups are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent, giving four distinct signals.\n\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of peaks is the sum of the signals from each distinct part of the molecule.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the total number of peaks based on this step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n    The molecule is: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry:\n    # The molecule has a C3 axis of symmetry, making the three large substituents equivalent.\n    # We count the unique proton signals from the central core and one of the substituents.\n\n    # 1.
