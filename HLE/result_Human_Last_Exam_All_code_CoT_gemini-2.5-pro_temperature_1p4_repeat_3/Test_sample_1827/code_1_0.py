    Calculates the number of Goldstone bosons for the specified QCD phase transition.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1.  Determine the symmetry group G of the gas phase and its number of generators.
    2.  Determine the residual symmetry group H of the condensed phase based on the problem's description.
    3.  The number of Goldstone bosons is the number of broken generators, dim(G) - dim(H).
