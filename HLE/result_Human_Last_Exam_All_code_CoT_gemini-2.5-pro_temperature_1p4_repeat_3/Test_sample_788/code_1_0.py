    Calculates the number of equivalence classes for the peg game on Z x Z.

    The method involves linear algebra over the finite field F_2 (integers modulo 2).
    1. The infinite grid is colored with 9 colors based on coordinates (x mod 3, y mod 3).
    2. A configuration is represented by a 9-dim vector of peg count parities for each color.
    3. Moves correspond to adding one of 6 generator vectors to this parity vector.
    4. The number of equivalence classes is 2^(9 - rank), where rank is the dimension
       of the subspace spanned by the 6 generator vectors.
