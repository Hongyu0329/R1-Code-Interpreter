    This problem is a theoretical question about the recurrence of controlled random walks.
    The reasoning, as outlined in the steps above, demonstrates that for any finite number k
    of genuinely d-dimensional, mean-zero probability measures in Z^d (d>=3),
    any control strategy will result in a transient walk.

    This means that one can never guarantee a return to the origin. The property holds
    for k=1, k=2, and so on, for all positive integers k.
    The question asks for the maximal integer k for which this property holds.
    Since it holds for all integers k, there is no maximum.
