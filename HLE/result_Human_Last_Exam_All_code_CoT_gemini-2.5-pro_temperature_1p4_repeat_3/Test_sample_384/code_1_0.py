            'summary': "After compiling the Bansenshukai, Fujibayashi deliberately removed this section to discredit the importance of female ninja techniques and/or female ninja.",
            'analysis': "This option is the least plausible. The primary purpose of the Bansenshukai, as compiled by Fujibayashi Yasutake, was to preserve and consolidate ninja knowledge for posterity. For the author to meticulously document techniques only to immediately erase them to discredit them is a fundamentally illogical and self-defeating act. It runs contrary to the entire goal of the project. A more logical way to express disapproval would have been to omit the section entirely or to add a critical commentary."
        },
        'B': {
            'summary': "The feudal transcribers considered the kunoichi techniques to be socially inappropriate or morally questionable and chose to leave this section blank.",
            'analysis': "This is a plausible explanation. The social and moral codes of feudal Japan were rigid. It is conceivable that scribes, often operating under religious or official patronage, would self-censor content they viewed as immoral, particularly techniques involving seduction or subterfuge that contradicted contemporary ideals of female modesty."
        },
        'C': {
            'summary': "Lady Saigō may have employed those covert female ninja techniques and had evidence destroyed to protect the Tokugawa lineage's legitimacy.",
            'analysis': "This is plausible as a type of explanation. While the direct link to Lady Saigō is speculative, the core idea—that a powerful political figure or family would redact sensitive information to protect their reputation and maintain stability—is a well-established historical practice."
        },
        'D': {
            'summary': "The Oniwaban, the Shogunate’s elite intelligence service, may have redacted these techniques to protect methods still actively used.",
            'analysis': "This is highly plausible. Governments and intelligence agencies throughout history have redacted or classified sensitive 'sources and methods' to prevent them from becoming public knowledge. If these kunoichi techniques were considered state secrets still in active use, the Shogunate's own security apparatus would have a strong motive to remove them from any transcribed copies."
        },
        'E': {
            'summary': "The blank circles might indicate hidden text written in invisible ink (aburidashi).",
            'analysis': "This is plausible. Aburidashi was a known ninjutsu technique for secret communication. If the original scroll used this method, scribes who were not initiated into the art would have been unable to see the text, and thus would have copied the section with blank spaces, leading to the consistent pattern in all surviving copies."
        },
        'F': {
            'summary': "The circles are mnemonic devices for techniques transmitted orally.",
            'analysis': "This is highly plausible. Many esoteric traditions, including martial arts, rely on an oral tradition where written texts serve only as memory aids for initiated practitioners. The circles would be meaningless to an outsider scribe, who would simply copy them as they appeared."
        },
        'G': {
            'summary': "The section containing the missing kanji might have been heavily read and referenced, leading to deterioration through manual overhandling.",
            'analysis': "This is a plausible explanation. If the single original scroll that all other copies were based on had become damaged or worn in a specific area, all subsequent transcriptions would faithfully reproduce that gap. Scribes would use placeholders like circles to indicate where illegible text once existed."
        },
        'H': {
            'summary': "The circles originated from a flawed transcription of the Kujiho, symbolizing Taoist energy rituals.",
            'analysis': "This is plausible, though highly speculative. The mechanism of a scribe misinterpreting esoteric symbols they don't understand is logical. While the specific explanation combining Kujiho, chakras, and erotic rituals seems convoluted, the underlying premise of a transcription error based on misunderstood symbols is a valid possibility."
