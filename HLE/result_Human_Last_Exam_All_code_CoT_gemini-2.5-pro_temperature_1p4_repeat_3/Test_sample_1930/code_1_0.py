    This function determines the dimension of the vector space of digitary functions.

    Plan:
    1.  A digitary function is determined by a sequence of functions (T_n), where each T_n maps D^3 to R.
    2.  The space of such parameter sequences (T_n) has a countably infinite basis (one basis vector for each n and each triplet (a,b,c) from D^3).
    3.  The condition that the function f is well-defined on numbers with two decimal representations imposes a countable set of linear constraints on these parameters.
    4.  The space of digitary functions is the solution space to this infinite system of linear equations.
    5.  The dimension of this space can be finite or countably infinite. It cannot be uncountably infinite because any function is defined by a countable number of parameters.
    6.  We can show the existence of an infinite set of linearly independent digitary functions.
        - For example, f(x) = 1 and f(x) = x are two digitary functions.
        - One can construct a family of functions f_m, for m = 0, 1, 2, ..., where f_m is "active" at digit position m (e.g., depends on A_m, A_{m+1}, ...) and is constructed to be well-defined. These functions can be made linearly independent.
    7.  For instance, we can construct functions based on T_n maps that are zero for n >= N for any N. The space of such functions is non-trivial and its dimension grows with N. This implies the total dimension is infinite.
    8.  Therefore, the dimension is countably infinite, which is denoted by 'N'.
