# The problem asks for the minimal number of new edges. Our derived formula for the
# number of edges, ceil(d + 1 + d/4), is an increasing function of d.
# Therefore, the minimum is achieved at the smallest possible value for d.
#
# Constraints on d:
# 1. d is even (given).
# 2. The edge connectivity of G is 2. The cut separating v1 from the rest of the
#    graph has size d(v1) = d. Thus, we must have d >= 2.
#
# The minimal valid value for d is 2.
d = 2

# We calculate the number of edges for this minimal d.
# The formula is N = ceil(d + 1 + d/4).
val1 = d + 1
val2 = d / 4.0
total = val1 + val2
result = math.ceil(total)
