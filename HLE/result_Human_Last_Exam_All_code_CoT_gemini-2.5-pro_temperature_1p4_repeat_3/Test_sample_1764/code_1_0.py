    This function determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings
    of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The "number of embeddings" is interpreted as the number of unique embeddings
       when disregarding translations. This is equivalent to counting "normalized"
       embeddings where a specific point in X is mapped to the origin of B.

    2. We seek the minimum number of such embeddings over all possible choices of X and B.

    3. We consider the simplest finite ultrametric space: a space with a single point, X = {p1}.
       The only distance is d(p1, p1) = 0.

    4. A normalized embedding f must map p1 to the origin of the Banach space. So, f(p1) = 0.

    5. We must verify if this single mapping is indeed an isometric embedding. The condition is:
       ||f(p1) - f(p1)|| = d(p1, p1)
       ||0 - 0|| = 0
       0 = 0
       This is true.

    6. Since there is only one possible function that satisfies the normalization condition (f(p1) = 0),
       and this function is a valid isometric embedding, the number of normalized embeddings for this space is 1.

    7. For any space with more than one point, we can show there are at least two such embeddings (f and -f).
       Therefore, the smallest possible number is 1.
