# Step 1: Define the initial number of curves from the problem statement.
initial_total_curves = 360

# Step 2: Calculate the number of curves that are removed ("lose their original form").
# The fraction of curves removed is 3/8 of the initial total.
curves_removed = (3 / 8) * initial_total_curves

# Step 3: Calculate the number of curves that were not disturbed and remained in the pattern.
unchanged_curves = initial_total_curves - curves_removed

# Step 4: Calculate the number of new curves the master must draw ("find new pathways").
# The fraction for new curves is 1/4 of the initial total.
# This is the number of curves the master must place to restore the pattern.
new_curves_added = (1 / 4) * initial_total_curves

# Step 5: (Verification) The problem states the new curves are broken into types based on
# fractions 1/5 and 2/9. The number of new curves (90) is divisible by both 5 and 9,
# so this interpretation is mathematically consistent.

# Step 6: The question asks for the total number of curves in the final, restored pattern.
# This is the sum of the original curves that were untouched and the new curves that were added.
final_total_curves = unchanged_curves + new_curves_added

# Step 7: Print the components of the calculation and the final answer.
# The problem asks for the numbers in the final equation to be output.
