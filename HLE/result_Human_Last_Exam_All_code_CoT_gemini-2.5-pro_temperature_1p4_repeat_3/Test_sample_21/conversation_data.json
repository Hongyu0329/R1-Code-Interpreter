    "This problem requires us to find the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the given polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$. This can be determined using the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Galois Group:** The first step is to determine the Galois group $G$ of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Condition for Irreducibility:** A polynomial of prime degree $q$ is irreducible modulo a prime $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ corresponding to $p$ acts as a $q$-cycle on the roots of the polynomial. In our case, the degree is $q=7$.\n3.  **Count Favorable Elements:** We will count the number of elements in the Galois group $G$ that are 7-cycles.\n4.  **Apply Chebotarev Density Theorem:** The theorem states that the desired density is the ratio of the number of favorable elements (the 7-cycles) to the total number of elements in the Galois group $G$.\n\nThe provided polynomial, $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$, is a well-known polynomial in algebraic number theory. It is constructed to be the minimal polynomial of a generator for a specific cyclic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 7. Its Galois group, $G$, is the cyclic group of order 7, denoted as $C_7$.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out the rest of the plan and compute the density.\n\n```python\ndef solve_density_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 is irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
