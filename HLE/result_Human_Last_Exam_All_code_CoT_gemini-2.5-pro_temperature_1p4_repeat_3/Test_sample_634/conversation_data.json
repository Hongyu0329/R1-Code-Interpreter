    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is equivalent to performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix to reduce it to a simpler form.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Construct a stacked matrix:** Create a single matrix M by stacking P1 on top of P2.\n    M = [P1; P2]\n2.  **Apply elementary row operations:** Use polynomial row operations to transform M into an upper triangular form `[D; 0]`, where D is a square matrix and 0 is a zero matrix. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Identify the GCRD:** The resulting non-zero matrix D at the top will be a greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution\n\nFirst, let's write down our initial matrices:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M**\n\nLet's denote the rows as R1, R2, R3, and R4.\nM =\n[s^2 + s,  -s]     (R1)\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]     (R2)\n[s,        0]        (R3)\n[-s - 1,   1]        (R4)\n\n**Step 2: Perform elementary row operations**\n\nThe element `1` in R4, column 2, is an excellent pivot to eliminate the other elements in that column.\n\n*   Perform `R1_new <- R1 + s * R4`:\n    [s^2 + s, -s] + s*[-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = **[0, 0]**\n*   Perform `R2_new <- R2 - s^2 * R4`:\n    [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2*[-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, s^2 - s^2] = **[s^3 - 1, 0]**\n\nAfter these operations, our set of rows is `{[0, 0], [s^3 - 1, 0], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]}`. Let's rewrite the matrix, ignoring the zero row for now:\nM' =\n[s^3 - 1,  0]      (R2_new)\n[s,        0]      (R3)\n[-s - 1,   1]      (R4)\n\nNow, we can simplify the first two rows. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor of the polynomials `s^3 - 1` and `s`.\nUsing polynomial division: `(s^3 - 1) = s^2 * (s) - 1`. The remainder is -1. The GCD is 1.\nWe can achieve this with a row operation:\n\n*   Perform `R2_newnew <- R2_new - s^2 * R3`:\n    [s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2*[s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = **[-1, 0]**\n\nOur set of rows is now `{[0, 0], [-1, 0], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]}`.\nThe row `[s, 0]` can be eliminated by the new row `[-1, 0]`.\n\n*   Perform `R3_new <- R3 + s * [-1, 0]`:\n    [s, 0] + s*[-1, 0] = [s - s, 0] = **[0, 0]**\n\nSo now we are left with just two non-zero rows: `[-1, 0]` and `[-s - 1, 1]`. Let's form our final matrix to reduce:\nM'' =\n[-1,     0]\n[-s-1, 1]\n\nWe can use the ` -1` in the first row to eliminate the `-s-1` in the second row.\n\n*   Perform `Row2_new <- Row2 - (s+1) * Row1`:\n    [-s - 1, 1] - (s+1)*[-1, 0] = [-s - 1 - (-s - 1), 1 - 0] = **[0, 1]**\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nM''' =\n[-1, 0]\n[0,  1]\n\nFinally, we multiply the first row by -1 to normalize the leading coefficient.\n\n*   Perform `Row1_new <- -1 * Row1`:\n    -1 * [-1, 0] = **[1, 0]**\n\nThe final reduced matrix is:\nD =\n[1, 0]\n[0, 1]\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe resulting matrix is the identity matrix. Therefore, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem is to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n# Based on the step-by-step derivation using the Euclidean algorithm (via row reduction),\n# the GCRD is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n# The final equation is GCRD = D, where D is the resulting matrix.\n# Here we define and print the matrix D.\nGCRD = np.array([\n    [1, 0],\n    [0, 1]\n])\n\nprint(\"The greatest common right divisor matrix is:\")\n# We output each number in the final resulting matrix\nprint(f\"[{GCRD[0, 0]}, {GCRD[0, 1]}]\")\nprint(f\"[{GCRD[1, 0]}, {GCRD[1, 1]}]\")\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
