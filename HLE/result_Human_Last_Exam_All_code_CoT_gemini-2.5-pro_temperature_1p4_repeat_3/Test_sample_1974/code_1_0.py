    # 1. Interpret the question in the context of mathematical logic (Gödel, MRDP Theorem).
    # 2. Show that the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of new Pi_1^0 sentences
    #    provable by adding an independent axiom psi to ZFC.
    # 3. Construct an infinite set of such sentences by choosing a powerful axiom psi,
    #    specifically one that implies a hierarchy of consistency statements.
    # 4. Conclude that the maximum cardinality is countably infinite (Aleph_0).
    # 5. Present the final answer in the requested "equation" format.

    print("This construction proves that the set S can contain a countably infinite number of equations.")
