    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$, which describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle, has a very specific and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe relationship is typically expressed in the frequency-momentum domain. The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ for a particle with momentum $k$ and frequency $\\omega$ is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n*   $\\epsilon_k$: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state with momentum $k$.\n*   $\\omega$: The frequency variable (which is the Fourier conjugate of time).\n*   $\\mu$: The chemical potential, which defines the Fermi level (the boundary between occupied and unoccupied states at zero temperature).\n*   $i\\delta$: An infinitesimal imaginary part that enforces causality (i.e., the time-ordering of events). The term $\\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$ ensures the imaginary part has the correct sign depending on whether the state is an unoccupied \"particle\" state ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$) or an occupied \"hole\" state ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$).\n\nIn essence, the functional dependence is an inverse relationship. $G_0$ has a simple pole in the complex frequency plane, and the real part of this pole's location is precisely the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates this by calculating the value of $G_0$ for a given set of parameters, showing how each number fits into the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and demonstrates the bare Green's function G_0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define example parameters ---\n    omega = 2.5       # Frequency\n    epsilon_k = 2.0   # Single-particle energy eigenvalue for state k\n    mu = 0.5          # Chemical potential\n    delta = 1e-9      # A small positive infinitesimal for causality\n\n    # --- Print explanations ---\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle\")\n    print(\"energy eigenvalue (epsilon_k) is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"\\n  G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta*sgn(epsilon_k - mu))\\n\")\n    print(\"This shows G_0 has a simple pole where the real part is determined by epsilon_k.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculation for the example case ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating for an example case ---\")\n    print(f\"Frequency (omega)                  = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"Single-particle energy (epsilon_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"Chemical Potential (mu)            = {mu}\")\n    print(f\"Infinitesimal (delta)              = {delta}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the sign term\n    # This determines if we are dealing with a particle (positive) or hole (negative)\n    sign_term = np.sign(epsilon_k - mu)\n\n    # --- Display the final equation with all numbers plugged in ---\n    print(\"Substituting these values into the formula step-by-step:\")\n\n    # Format the imaginary part's sign for clear output\n    imaginary_part_sign_str = \"+\" if sign_term >= 0 else \"-\"\n    \n    # Calculate the final denominator and the Green's function\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * delta * sign_term\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Print the equation with all the variables from the problem statement\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( omega - epsilon_k + i * delta * sgn(epsilon_k - mu) )\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {omega} - {epsilon_k} + i * {delta} * sgn({epsilon_k} - {mu}) )\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {omega} - {epsilon_k} + i * {delta} * ({int(sign_term)}) )\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {omega - epsilon_k} {imaginary_part_sign_str} i * {delta} )\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {denominator} )\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Result: G_0 = {G0}\")\n\n# Run the calculation and print the results\ncalculate_bare_greens_function()\n\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.
