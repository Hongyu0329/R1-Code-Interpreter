The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The precise functional form is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta \cdot \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu)}$, which describes a simple pole structure in the complex frequency plane.
