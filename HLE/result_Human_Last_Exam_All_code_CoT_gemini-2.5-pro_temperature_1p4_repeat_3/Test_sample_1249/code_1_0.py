def solve_hopf_ore_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the Hopf-Ore extension problem based on formal algebraic manipulation.

    The solution is derived under the following interpretations and standard assumptions:
    1. The potential contradiction arising from the given `g . 1_R = 0` (which may imply R={0}) is set aside in favor of a symbolic manipulation approach, which seems to be the intent of the problem.
    2. The action of x on any element r in R is derived as `x . r = w * r`, where `w = x . 1_R`.
    3. The action of x^k on r is then `x^k . r = w^k * r`.
    4. The automorphism sigma is assumed to be the standard one for this context, `sigma(a) = g*a*g^(-1)`, which simplifies `sigma^d(a)` to `a` given `g^d=1`.
    5. Potentially extraneous information (`q in G'_M` and the redundant `w^M in Z(R)`) is considered non-essential for the derivation.
