def solve_scale_cardinalities():
    """
    This script calculates the cardinalities based on the mathematical reasoning outlined above.

    1. Cardinality of S/A:
       - A is the initial object (id: Z -> Z), so G_A = Z.
       - S is the scale (inc: Z -> *R), so G_S = *R (the hyperreals).
       - The quotient S/A corresponds to *R / Z.
       - The cardinality of *R is 2^c = 2^(2^Beth_0) = Beth_2.
       - The cardinality of *R / Z is Beth_2.
    
    2. Cardinality of B/S:
       - B is the terminal object (zero: Z -> {0}), so G_B = {0}.
       - The quotient B/S corresponds to G_B / im(h_SB), where h_SB: *R -> {0} is the zero map.
       - The quotient is {0} / {0} = {0}.
       - The cardinality is 1.

    3. Cardinality of H_1(B/A, Q):
       - The group B/A is G_B / im(h_AB), where h_AB: Z -> {0} is the zero map.
       - The quotient group B/A is {0} / {0} = {0}.
       - The first homology group of the trivial group {0} is trivial, H_1({0}, Q) = {0}.
       - The cardinality is 1.
