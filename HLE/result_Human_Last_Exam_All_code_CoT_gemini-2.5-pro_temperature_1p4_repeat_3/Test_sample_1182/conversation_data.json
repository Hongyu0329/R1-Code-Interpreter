    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will follow a plan based on the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Simplify the Model**: The given equation for the curve is not in an optimal form for analysis. We will perform a change of variables to obtain a new model where the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side have non-negative 2-adic valuations.\n2.  **Determine Root Valuations**: For the new model's polynomial, we'll determine the 2-adic valuations of its roots. A powerful tool for this is the Newton polygon method.\n3.  **Cluster the Roots**: The roots are grouped into \"clusters\" based on their 2-adic distances. Two roots, $e_i$ and $e_j$, belong to the same cluster if their 2-adic distance $v_2(e_i - e_j)$ is positive.\n4.  **Analyze the Stable Reduction**: The structure of the stable reduction's special fiber is determined by these clusters. Each cluster corresponds to an irreducible component in the special fiber. The number of double points is the number of intersections between these components. For a tree-like configuration of rational curves (which is the case here), the number of double points is one less than the number of components.\n5.  **Calculate the Result**: By counting the number of clusters, we can find the number of components and thus the number of double points.\n\nThe following Python code implements the computational part of this plan (steps 2 and 5) and prints the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    v = 0\n    while n % p == 0:\n        v += 1\n        n //= p\n    return v\n\ndef newton_polygon_valuations(coeffs, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the p-adic valuations of the roots of a polynomial\n    using its Newton polygon.\n    The polynomial is defined by its list of coefficients, from constant term to leading term.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not coeffs:\n        return []\n    \n    valuations = [get_valuation(c, p) for c in coeffs]\n    points = [(i, val) for i, val in enumerate(valuations) if val != float('inf')]\n    \n    if not points:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the lower convex hull vertices\n    hull_vertices = [points[0]]\n    current_point_idx = 0\n    while current_point_idx < len(points) - 1:\n        min_slope = float('inf')\n        next_point_idx = -1\n        # Find the point that forms the next segment of the hull\n        for i in range(current_point_idx + 1, len(points)):\n            slope = (points[i][1] - points[current_point_idx][1]) / (points[i][0] - points[current_point_idx][0])\n            if slope < min_slope:\n                min_slope = slope\n                next_point_idx = i\n        hull_vertices.append(points[next_point_idx])\n        current_point_idx = next_point_idx\n\n    # Calculate root valuations from the hull segments\n    root_valuations = []\n    for i in range(len(hull_vertices) - 1):\n        p1 = hull_vertices[i]\n        p2 = hull_vertices[i+1]\n        slope = (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n        length = p2[0] - p1[0]\n        root_valuation = -slope\n        root_valuations.extend([root_valuation] * length)\n    \n    return root_valuations\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The curve is C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x.\")\n    print(\"We analyze its stable reduction above the prime p=2.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Simplify the model.\")\n    print(\"The roots of the polynomial have 2-adic valuations {inf, 3, -1, -1, -1}.\")\n    print(\"The negative valuations suggest a change of variables x = X/2.\")\n    print(\"The new model is Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X.\")\n    print(\"Let P(X) = X(X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16).\")\n    print(\"The roots of P(X) are 0 and the roots of h(X) = X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine root valuations of h(X) using its Newton polygon.\")\n    # Coefficients of h(X) from constant to leading term\n    h_coeffs = [16, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n    p = 2\n    h_root_valuations = newton_polygon_valuations(h_coeffs, p)\n    \n    print(f\"The 2-adic valuations of the roots of h(X) are: {h_root_valuations}\")\n    print(\"So, the 2-adic valuations of the roots of P(X) are {inf (for root 0), 4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Cluster the roots.\")\n    print(\"Two roots e_i, e_j are in the same cluster if v_2(e_i - e_j) > 0.\")\n    print(\"Let the roots of P(X) be e_0=0, and e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4 be the roots of h(X).\")\n    print(\" - The root e_1 with v_2(e_1) = 4 clusters with e_0=0, since v_2(e_1 - e_0) = 4 > 0.
