    """
    Analyzes and prints the consequences of a relativity theory based on a
    Euclidean spacetime metric (s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2).

    The transformations that preserve this metric are 4D rotations. For a boost
    with velocity v along the x-axis (in c=1 units), the transformations are:
    x' = (x - v*t) / sqrt(1 + v^2)
    t' = (t + v*x) / sqrt(1 + v^2)

    This code evaluates 8 questions based on these transformation laws.
