    "This is a fascinating and deep question that bridges the fields of metaphysics, formal logic, and theoretical physics. To provide a clear answer, we must first understand the distinct nature of Gödel's ontological proof and the mathematics of quantum mechanics.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Gödel's Ontological Proof:** I will explain that this is a proof within the system of modal logic. It is not about physical reality but about the logical consequences of a specific set of axioms and definitions concerning \"positive properties.\" Its validity rests on the acceptance of its axioms and the rules of modal logic.\n2.  **Analyze the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics (QM):** I will describe the mathematical toolkit of QM, which includes linear algebra on Hilbert spaces, complex numbers, differential equations (like the Schrödinger equation), and probability theory. This mathematics is designed to model the behavior of observable, physical systems (particles, fields, energy).\n3.  **Identify the Conceptual Mismatch:** The core of the problem is a fundamental \"category error.\" QM's mathematics describes *physical* reality. Gödel's proof describes an *abstract, logical* structure. There is no concept in QM that corresponds to Gödel's notion of a \"positive property,\" nor is there a way to represent a \"god-like entity\" as a wavefunction or an operator in a Hilbert space. The tools of QM are built to answer questions about position, momentum, and energy, not about metaphysical existence.\n4.  **Create a Demonstrative Script:** Since a direct proof is impossible, I will write a Python script that programmatically outlines this conceptual separation. The script will define the domains and tools of each field and explain why they are incompatible for this task. To satisfy the prompt's unusual constraint of \"outputting numbers in a final equation,\" I will create a symbolic equation representing this incompatibility, where the result is zero.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_proof_compatibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically explains why the mathematics of quantum mechanics\n    cannot be used to prove or disprove Gödel's ontological proof.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Gödel's Ontological Proof\n    godel_proof = {\n        \"name\": \"Gödel's Ontological Proof\",\n        \"domain\": \"Metaphysics and Formal Logic\",\n        \"mathematical_system\": \"Modal Logic S5\",\n        \"core_concepts\": [\"Axioms\", \"Positive Properties\", \"Necessary Existence\"]\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics\n    quantum_mechanics = {\n        \"name\": \"Quantum Mechanics\",\n        \"domain\": \"Physics (The study of physical reality)\",\n        \"mathematical_system\": \"Linear Algebra, Probability, and Analysis\",\n        \"core_concepts\": [\"Hilbert Spaces\", \"Wavefunctions\", \"Operators\", \"Observables\"]\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the fundamental mismatch (the \"Category Error\")\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Two Systems ---\")\n    print(f\"System 1 Name: {godel_proof['name']}\")\n    print(f\"System 1 Domain: {godel_proof['domain']}\")\n    print(f\"System 1 Tools: {godel_proof['mathematical_system']} based on {godel_proof['core_concepts']}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"System 2 Name: {quantum_mechanics['name']}\")\n    print(f\"System 2 Domain: {quantum_mechanics['domain']}\")\n    print(f\"System 2 Tools: {quantum_mechanics['mathematical_system']} based on {quantum_mechanics['core_concepts']}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Conclusion on Compatibility ---\")\n    print(\"The tools of Quantum Mechanics are designed to model physical phenomena.\")\n    print(\"Gödel's proof is an argument within an abstract logical system.\")\n    print(\"There is no known way to map the abstract concept of a 'positive property' onto a physical quantity like position, spin, or momentum.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is not applicable to the domain of Gödel's proof.\")\n    print(\"Proving one with the other is like trying to measure the temperature of a triangle; the concepts do not align.\")\n\n    # Step 4: A symbolic equation to demonstrate the incompatibility, satisfying the prompt's format.\n    # This equation states that the conceptual overlap between the two systems for this task is zero.\n    print(\"\\n--- Symbolic Final Equation ---\")\n    print(\"The conceptual applicability of QM's math to Gödel's proof can be symbolically represented as:\")\n    \n    # We create a simple equation: Overlap = 0\n    # The final equation is \"Overlap = 0\".
