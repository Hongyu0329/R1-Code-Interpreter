    "This is a knowledge-based question about ballet training methodologies. My plan is to encode the known characteristics of each ballet school into a Python data structure. Then, I will write a script to search this data structure for the school that matches the specific training style described in the questionâ€”extensive use of pointe shoes at the barre. The script will then print the explanation and the correct answer.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Create a dictionary where each key is an answer choice (A, B, C, D, E) and the value is another dictionary containing the school's name and a note about its training method.\n2.  The note for the correct school will specifically mention the practice of using pointe shoes for barre work.\n3.  The program will iterate through the schools and identify the one whose training note matches the query.\n4.  Finally, it will print a detailed explanation of why that school is the correct answer and state the corresponding letter.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_school():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet school training methods to find which one\n    is known for female dancers training on pointe at the barre.\n    \"\"\"\n    schools = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'La Scala Theatre Ballet School',\n            'method_note': 'Primarily follows the Italian Cecchetti method, focusing on clean lines and anatomical principles.
