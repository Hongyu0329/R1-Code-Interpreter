In toroidal grid generation, the primary goal for resolution consistency is to make the grid cells have roughly uniform size or aspect ratio in physical space. A torus has a shorter circumference on its inner side (the 'inboard' side, near the hole) and a longer circumference on its outer side (the 'outboard' side).

A simple grid with uniform angular spacing would result in grid cells that are much smaller and more crowded on the inboard side than on the outboard side. To counteract this geometric effect, a mapping function is used to stretch the grid.

This function takes a uniform coordinate from a simple computational grid and maps it to a non-uniform coordinate in the physical toroidal space. The ideal function for this is one that can smoothly cluster points in one region and spread them out in another.

From the options provided:
- Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine) are essential for defining the toroidal shape itself but do not inherently manage the grid spacing for resolution.
- Other options like "Grid spacing function" or "Radial Scaling Function" are descriptive categories, not the name of a specific mathematical function.

The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is widely used for this purpose. Its characteristic 'S'-curve shape provides a smooth transition that can be easily controlled to pack grid lines on the outboard side and space them out on the inboard side, achieving a more uniform grid cell size across the entire domain.
