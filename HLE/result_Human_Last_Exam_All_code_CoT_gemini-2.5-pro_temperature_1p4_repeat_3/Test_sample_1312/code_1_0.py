        'C': "Transposable elements are generally considered parasitic DNA. Their accumulation is often a *result* of ineffective purifying selection in low-recombination regions, not a compensatory mechanism.",
        'D': "Multigene families, which arise from gene duplication, provide functional redundancy. If one gene copy is inactivated by a deleterious mutation, other functional copies can persist, maintaining the organism's fitness. This directly counteracts Muller's Ratchet and is considered a key compensatory mechanism, especially on degenerating Y chromosomes.",
