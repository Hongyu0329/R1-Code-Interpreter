    "An ampule is a single-dose container that, once broken open, cannot be resealed. This means its contents are immediately exposed to the surrounding environment and are susceptible to contamination. According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> on sterile compounding, a single-dose ampule is intended for immediate use only once opened, regardless of the environment's sterility. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately.\n\nTherefore, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is immediate. There is no allowable storage time. The following Python code will state this conclusion clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    after it is opened in a sterile environment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the scenario\n    container_type = \"single-dose ampule\"\n    action = \"opened/punctured\"\n    environment = \"sterile environment (e.g., ISO Class 5)\"\n\n    # According to USP <797>, ampules are for immediate use only.\n    # The effective time for storage is zero.\n    bud_in_hours = 0\n\n    # Print the explanation\n    print(f\"Scenario: Determining the BUD for a {container_type} {action} in a {environment}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Guideline: According to USP <797>, an ampule is a glass container that cannot be resealed once opened.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: Because it cannot be sealed, its contents must be used immediately to prevent contamination.\")\n    print(\"Any unused portion of the medication must be discarded right away.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Print the final answer based on the \"equation\" of time\n    # Final Equation: Start Time + BUD = Discard Time\n    # In this case, BUD is 0 hours.\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is effectively immediate.\")\n    print(f\"The number of hours for storage after opening is: {bud_in_hours}\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the ampule contents must be used immediately, and the remainder discarded.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nget_ampule_bud_info()\n```\n<<<Immediate use>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
