    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can follow a systematic approach using programming.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the properties:**\n    *   A **simple graph** has no loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n    *   **Nonisomorphic graphs** are graphs with distinct structures.\n    *   A **2-vertex-connected graph** (or biconnected graph) is a connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points (cut vertices). For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, it must have at least 3 vertices and a minimum degree of 2.\n\n2.  **Enumeration and Verification:**\n    *   The most reliable way to solve this is to generate all simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and then test each one for the 2-vertex-connectivity property.\n    *   There are 34 such nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    *   We will use the Python library `networkx`, which provides a comprehensive graph atlas and robust functions to check graph properties.\n\n3.  **Execution with Python:**\n    *   We will load the list of all small nonisomorphic graphs from `networkx.graph_atlas_g()`.\n    *   We will filter this list to keep only the graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n    *   For each of these 34 graphs, we will use `networkx.node_connectivity()` to determine its vertex connectivity. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is 2 or greater.\n    *   We will count the number of graphs that meet this criterion.\n    *   To provide a detailed answer and satisfy the request to show numbers in an equation, we will group the results by the number of edges (`m`) in the graphs and present the total as a sum.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of 2-vertex-connected simple\n    nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices using the networkx library.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The networkx graph atlas contains all non-isomorphic simple graphs up to 7 vertices.\n    all_small_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # Filter the atlas to get only the graphs with 5 vertices.\n    graphs_n5 = [g for g in all_small_graphs if g.number_of_nodes() == 5]\n\n    # Identify the graphs that are 2-vertex-connected.\n    # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is at least 2.\n    biconnected_graphs = [g for g in graphs_n5 if nx.node_connectivity(g) >= 2]\n\n    # Group the biconnected graphs by their number of edges to show a breakdown.\n    count_by_edges = {}\n    for g in biconnected_graphs:\n        num_edges = g.number_of_edges()\n        count_by_edges[num_edges] = count_by_edges.get(num_edges, 0) + 1\n\n    print(\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is found by summing the counts for each possible number of edges (m).\\n\")\n    print(\"Number of such graphs for each edge count:\")\n\n    equation_parts = []\n    # Sort keys (number of edges) for an ordered printout.\n    sorted_edge_counts = sorted(count_by_edges.keys())\n\n    for m in sorted_edge_counts:\n        count = count_by_edges[m]\n        print(f\"m = {m}: {count} graph(s)\")\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n\n    total_count = len(biconnected_graphs)\n\n    # Print the final count as a sum, as requested.\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(\"\\nThe final count is the sum of these numbers:\")\n    print(f\"{final_equation} = {total_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_biconnected_graphs()\n```\n<<<21>>>"
