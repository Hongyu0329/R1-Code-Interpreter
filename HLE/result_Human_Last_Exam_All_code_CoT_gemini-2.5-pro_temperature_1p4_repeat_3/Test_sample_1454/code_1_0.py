# The problem defines a set F with a self-similar property.
# F is a closed set in the unit square [0,1]^2 satisfying:
# F = Union_{d in D} (F+d)/4
# where D = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),(0,3),(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),(3,3)}.

# Let T(S) be the operator T(S) = Union_{d in D} (S+d)/4.
# The set F is a fixed point of this operator, i.e., F = T(F).

# The operator T is a contraction mapping on the space of all compact subsets
# of the plane, with the Hausdorff metric. The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem
# guarantees a unique non-empty fixed point, which is the attractor of the IFS.

# As analyzed in the thinking steps, this unique non-empty attractor is F = C x I,
# where C is the middle-half Cantor set on the x-axis and I is the interval [0,1]
# on the y-axis.
# The connected components of this set are vertical line segments {x} x [0,1]
# for each x in the Cantor set C.
# Each of these components is non-degenerate (it's a line segment, not a point)
# and locally connected.
# The number of points in a Cantor set is uncountably infinite.
# So, for the non-empty attractor, there is an infinite number of components
# satisfying the properties.

# However, the question asks for the "smallest possible number".
# This phrasing suggests that there might be more than one set F satisfying the
# condition.
# Let's consider the empty set, F = {}.
# T({}) = Union_{d in D} ({}+d)/4 = Union_{d in D} {}/4 = {}.
# So, the empty set is also a fixed point of the operator T.
# The empty set is a closed set in the unit square.

# Now, we must find the number of components of the empty set that are
# non-degenerate and locally connected.
# The empty set has 0 connected components.
# The condition that these components must be non-degenerate and locally
# connected is vacuously true because there are no components to test.
# Therefore, for the case F = {}, the number of such components is 0.

# Comparing the two possible solutions for F:
# 1. The non-empty attractor, which gives an infinite number of components.
# 2. The empty set, which gives 0 components.

# The smallest possible number is therefore 0.
result = 0
