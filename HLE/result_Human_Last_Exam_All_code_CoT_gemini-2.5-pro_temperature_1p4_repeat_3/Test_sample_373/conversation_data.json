    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the specified graph and the mechanics of the gossiping algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically formed by connecting two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (`K_5`) with a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Understand Uniform Gossiping**: The process for sampling an edge is as follows:\n    a. A node is selected from all 10 nodes with uniform probability (`1/10`).\n    b. The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors, also with uniform probability.\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees**: We need the degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. Let's call these nodes `u` and `v`.\n    *   Node `u` is in the first `K_5`. It is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique and to node `v` via the bottleneck. So, `degree(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, node `v` is in the second `K_5` and is connected to 4 nodes in its clique and to `u`. So, `degree(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if either of two mutually exclusive events happens:\n    a. Node `u` is selected, and it chooses to gossip with `v`.\n    b. Node `v` is selected, and it chooses to gossip with `u`.\n    *   The probability is `P(sampling edge) = P(u is chosen) * P(u chooses v) + P(v is chosen) * P(v chooses u)`.\n    *   Plugging in the values: `P = (1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5)`.\n5.  **Implement in Python**: Write a script to formalize and execute this calculation, printing the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph using uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A 10-node barbell graph consists of two K_5 (5-node complete graphs)\n    # connected by a single edge (the bottleneck).\n    clique_size = 5\n\n    # The bottleneck edge connects one node from each clique. Let's call them u and v.\n    # The degree of these nodes is the number of connections within their clique (clique_size - 1)\n    # plus the single connection via the bottleneck edge.\n    degree_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # In uniform gossiping, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u, v) is the sum\n    # of two probabilities:\n    # 1. Selecting node u and u choosing v: P(select u) * P(u chooses v)\n    # 2. Selecting node v and v choosing u: P(select v) * P(v chooses u)\n    #\n    # P(select node) = 1 / total_nodes\n    # P(node chooses neighbor) = 1 / degree(node)\n\n    prob_select_u = f\"1/{total_nodes}\"\n    prob_u_chooses_v = f\"1/{degree_bottleneck_node}\"\n    \n    prob_select_v = f\"1/{total_nodes}\"\n    prob_v_chooses_u = f\"1/{degree_bottleneck_node}\"\n    \n    final_prob = (1/total_nodes) * (1/degree_bottleneck_node) + (1/total_nodes) * (1/degree_bottleneck_node)\n    \n    print(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is calculated as:\")\n    print(\"P(edge) = P(select u) * P(u chooses v) + P(select v) * P(v chooses u)\")\n    print(f\"P(edge) = ({prob_select_u}) * ({prob_u_chooses_v}) + ({prob_select_v}) * ({prob_v_chooses_u})\")\n    print(f\"P(edge) = (1/{total_nodes*degree_bottleneck_node}) + (1/{total_nodes*degree_bottleneck_node})\")\n    print(f\"P(edge) = {2}/{total_nodes*degree_bottleneck_node} = {final_prob}\")\n\nsolve_gossip_probability()\n<<<0.04>>>\n```"
