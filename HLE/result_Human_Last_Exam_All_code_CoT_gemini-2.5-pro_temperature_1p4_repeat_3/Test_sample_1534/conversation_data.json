    "This is a biological question that cannot be answered with a script. I will provide the answer based on cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the subesophageal mass and is one of the most posterior lobes in the central brain of a cuttlefish. The structures lying immediately adjacent posteriorly are the **posterior chromatophore lobes**. These lobes are responsible for the fine control of the chromatophores (color-changing skin cells) on the posterior parts of the body and are often considered to be a functional part of the greater palliovisceral lobe complex. Additionally, the large **stellar nerves**, containing the giant axons that control the muscles for jet propulsion, emerge from this posterior region of the brain.\n\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes and the stellar nerves.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
