    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish the mathematical representation of the object in question. The \"double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil\" is a 4-dimensional manifold, and its properties are captured by its fundamental group, let's call it $\\Pi$. I will state the standard presentation of this group using generators and relations.\n2.  Next, I will determine a lower bound for the minimal number of generators of $\\Pi$. A fundamental theorem in group theory states that the number of generators of a group must be at least as large as the number of generators of its abelianization. I will compute the abelianization of $\\Pi$ and find its number of generators. I will also use another method, finding a surjective homomorphism to a known group ($S_3$), to confirm this lower bound.\n3.  Then, I will establish an upper bound. I'll show that the group $\\Pi$ can be generated by just two elements. To do this, I will define a new set of two generators and demonstrate that all the original generators of the group can be expressed in terms of this new set.\n4.  Finally, by showing that the minimal number of generators is both greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2, I can conclude that the number is exactly 2. I will write a Python script to print out these steps and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script details the step-by-step derivation of the minimal number of\n    generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S^4\n    over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the fundamental group Pi.\")\n    print(\"The manifold is the double branched cover of the 4-sphere S^4 over a knotted 2-sphere K.\")\n    print(\"The knot K is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\")\n    print(\"Let the trefoil knot group be G_T = <x, y | xyx = yxy>.\")\n    print(\"The fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil, pi_1(S^4 - K), is given by:\")\n    print(\"G_K = <x, y, t | xyx = yxy, xt = tx, yt = t * x^5 * y * x^(-5)>\")\n    print(\"The fundamental group of the double branched cover, Pi, is obtained by adding the relation t^2 = 1.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the presentation for our group is:\")\n    print(\"Pi = <x, y, t | xyx = yxy, xt = tx, yt = t * x^5 * y * x^(-5), t^2 = 1>\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Find a lower bound for the number of generators.\")\n    print(\"A lower bound for the number of generators of a group can be found by examining its quotients.\")\n    print(\"We can define a surjective homomorphism (a map that preserves group structure) from Pi to the symmetric group S_3.\")\n    print(\"Let phi: Pi -> S_3 be defined by:\")\n    print(\"phi(x) = (1 2)\")\n    print(\"phi(y) = (2 3)\")\n    print(\"phi(t) = (1 2)\")\n    print(\"We can verify that this mapping is consistent with the relations in Pi:\")\n    print(\"- phi(xyx) = (12)(23)(12) = (13) and phi(yxy) = (23)(12)(23) = (13).
