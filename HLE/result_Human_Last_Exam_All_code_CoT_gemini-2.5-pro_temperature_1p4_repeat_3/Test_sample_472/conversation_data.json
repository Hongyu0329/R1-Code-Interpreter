    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to scan the provided Latin line, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Meter:** The line `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male` is from the Roman playwright Plautus. Its structure is a **trochaic septenarius**, a common meter in Roman comedy. This meter consists of seven trochaic feet (`L S`) followed by a final, incomplete (catalectic) eighth foot.\n2.  **Handle Elision:** In Latin poetry, when a word ending in a vowel (or vowel + 'm') is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, elision occurs. Here, `bene esse` is phonetically merged into `ben'esse`, reducing the syllable count.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Quantities:** I will analyze the line syllable by syllable to determine its quantity (length). A syllable is **Long (L)** if it contains a long vowel or diphthong, or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it is **Short (S)**.\n    *   The quantities are: `et(L) ti(S) bi(S) ben'(S) es(L) se(S) so(L) li(L) quom(L) si(S) bi(S) sit(L) ma(S) le(S)`\n4.  **Group into Feet:** I will group this sequence of long and short syllables into the seven and a half feet of a trochaic septenarius. The standard trochaic foot (`L S`) can be replaced by valid substitutions like a pyrrhic (`S S`), a spondee (`L L`), or a dactyl (`L S S`).\n5.  **Generate Output:** The final code will assemble the feet into a single string, with each foot separated by a space, and print the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the scansion:\n\n```python\n# The line to be scanned:\n# \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n# This line is identified as a trochaic septenarius.\n# A trochaic foot is Long-Short (L S). Common substitutions are allowed.\n# The elision \"bene esse\" -> \"ben'esse\" is applied.\n\n# Based on analysis, the line is broken down into the following metrical feet.\n# Each variable represents one foot in the line.\nfoot_1 = \"L S\"    # Corresponds to \"et ti\"\nfoot_2 = \"S S\"    # Corresponds to \"bi ben'\" (from elided bene)\nfoot_3 = \"L S\"    # Corresponds to \"esse\"\nfoot_4 = \"L L\"    # Corresponds to \"soli\"\nfoot_5 = \"L S S\"  # Corresponds to \"quom sibi\"\nfoot_6 = \"L S\"    # Corresponds to \"sit ma\"\nfoot_7 = \"S\"      # Corresponds to the final syllable \"-le\"\n\n# The list of feet is joined into a single string with spaces separating each foot.\nfinal_scansion = \"  \".join([foot_1, foot_2, foot_3, foot_4, foot_5, foot_6, foot_7])\n\n# The final result is printed.\nprint(final_scansion)\n```\n<<<L S  S S  L S  L L  L S S  L S  S>>>"
