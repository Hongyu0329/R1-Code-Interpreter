def solve_dispersion_point_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem of finding the maximum number of dispersion points
    in a compact connected metric space.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Assume for contradiction that there are two distinct dispersion points, p1 and p2.
    2.  Let X be the compact connected metric space.
    3.  By definition of a dispersion point, X \ {p1} and X \ {p2} are totally disconnected.
    4.  A key implication is that any non-degenerate connected subset of X must contain both p1 and p2.
    5.  However, we can construct a non-degenerate connected subset that does not contain p2.
        - Since X \ {p1} is totally disconnected, we can separate p2 from any other point q.
        - This means X \ {p1} = U U V, where U and V are disjoint open sets, p2 is in U, and q is in V.
        - A theorem states that the set K = {p1} U V is connected.
        - K is non-degenerate because it contains p1 and q.
        - Therefore, K must contain p2.
        - But p2 is in U, which is disjoint from V and {p1}. So p2 is not in K.
    6.  This is a contradiction. The assumption of two dispersion points is false.
    7.  Therefore, there can be at most one dispersion point.
    8.  An example of a space with one dispersion point (the cone over the Cantor set) exists.
