    "The value you are looking for is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. In the context of HRV analysis, this is most commonly referred to as the R-R interval, named after the R wave peak in an electrocardiogram (ECG) QRS complex. Even when using PPG, which measures pulse waves, the underlying term from which HRV metrics are derived is often still called the R-R interval, or sometimes the more general term, inter-beat interval (IBI).\n\nHere is a simple python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\n# The value computed as the time between heartbeats for HRV is known as the R-R interval.\n# This script prints the name of that value.\n\nvalue_name = \"R-R interval\"\nprint(f\"The value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis is called the: {value_name}\")\n\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
