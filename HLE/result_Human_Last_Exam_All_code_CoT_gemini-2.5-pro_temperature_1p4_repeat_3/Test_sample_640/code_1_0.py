    This function identifies and prints the numbers of the correct statements
    about two-channel quantum scattering based on the analysis that the
    property of being trivially or nontrivially coupled is equivalent for the
    potential V(r), the Jost matrix F(E), and the S-matrix S(E).

    The analysis concluded:
    1. Correct: S_nontrivial => V_nontrivial
    2. Incorrect: S_diagonal => V_diagonal
    3. Correct: V_nontrivial => F_nontrivial
    4. Correct: F_nontrivial => S_nontrivial
    5. Incorrect: Existence of V_nontrivial with F_diagonal (F_trivial)
