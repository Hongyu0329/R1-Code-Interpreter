    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will address the primary task of solving the lexicographical string comparison problem. A Python script is a clean and straightforward way to achieve this. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Read the two input strings.\n2.  Convert both strings to the same case (e.g., lowercase) to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n3.  Perform a direct lexicographical comparison on the normalized strings.\n4.  Print \"-1\" if the first string is smaller, \"1\" if it's larger, and \"0\" if they are identical.\n\nSecond, I will address the specific question about the memory efficiency of a C program for this task. To find the most memory-efficient solution in C, I'll design a program that avoids creating extra copies of strings and uses the smallest possible data types for its variables.\n1.  The program will need two character arrays to store the input strings. Since the maximum length is 100, we need buffers of size 101 to accommodate the null terminator (`\\0`). `char s1[101];` and `char s2[101];`.\n2.  The program will iterate through the strings character by character, comparing them on the fly after converting each character to lowercase using `tolower()`.\n3.  A loop counter is needed. The maximum value for the index is 99. The `char` data type, which is 1 byte, can store values from 0 to 127 (or more, depending on if it's signed/unsigned) and is sufficient for this purpose, making it more memory-efficient than an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n4.  The total memory `m` will be the sum of the memory used by these variables: `sizeof(s1) + sizeof(s2) + sizeof(loop_counter)`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the total memory usage will be `101 bytes` (for the first string) + `101 bytes` (for the second string) + `1 byte` (for the char loop counter) = `203 bytes`.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Petya and Strings problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the two strings from standard input\n        s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        s1_lower = s1.lower()\n        s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n        # Compare the two lowercase strings lexicographically\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle potential errors, though problem constraints suggest valid input\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<203>>>"
