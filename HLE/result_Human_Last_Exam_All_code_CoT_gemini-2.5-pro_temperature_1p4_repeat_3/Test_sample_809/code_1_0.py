    # Step 1: Determine h.
    # The traversal probability of f, P(f), follows the equation: P(f) = x + (1-x) * P(f)^2.
    # We want the smallest x for which traversal is guaranteed, i.e., P(f) = 1.
    # Substituting P(f)=1 gives 1 = x + (1-x)*1^2, which is 1=1.
    # The actual condition is that the iterative solution converges to 1. The fixed points of the
    # recurrence are 1 and x/(1-x). For the system to converge to 1, the fixed point at 1 must be
    # stable, which occurs when x >= 0.5. The smallest such value is 0.5.
    h = 0.5

    # Step 2: Determine the traversal probability of g (q).
    # g has 3 paths. Path 1 prob = h = 0.5. Path 2 prob = 2 * Path 3 prob.
    # P1 + P2 + P3 = 1 => 0.5 + 2*P3 + P3 = 1 => 3*P3 = 0.5 => P3 = 1/6.
    # The traversal probability of g, let's call it q, follows the equation:
    # q = (prob Path 1) * (success of Path 1) + (prob Path 3) * (success of Path 3)
    # q = 0.5 * 1 + (1/6) * q^6
    # This gives the polynomial equation q^6 - 6q + 3 = 0.
    # We need to find the root of this equation between 0 and 1.
    
    # We use a numerical bisection method to find q.

    # k is a chain of 4 instances of g.
    p_k = q**4

    # Step 4: Calculate the expected value of the bet.
    # The number of successes N in 100 trials follows a binomial distribution B(n=100, p=p_k).
