    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\n### Plan:\nTo find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of space, time, velocity, and pressure that leave the equations unchanged. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters required to specify these transformations.\n\nThe finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is composed of the following transformations:\n\n1.  **Time translations:** Shifting the time origin ($t' = t + a_0$). This transformation has **1** parameter.\n2.  **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial origin ($\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$). In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this transformation has **3** parameters.\n3.  **Spatial rotations:** Rotating the coordinate system ($\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$). The group of rotations in 3D, SO(3), has a dimension of **3**.\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity ($\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$). The velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ has **3** parameters.\n5.  **Scaling transformations:** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure ($t' = \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$). This is a single-parameter family of transformations, so it contributes **1** to the dimension.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetry subgroups. The following Python code will calculate this sum and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n#\n# Calculate the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n# 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n#\n# The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the individual\n# symmetry subgroups.\n#\n\n# Dimension from time translations (t' = t + a)\ndim_time_translation = 1\n\n# Dimension from space translations (x' = x + a) in R^3\ndim_space_translation = 3\n\n# Dimension from spatial rotations (x' = Rx) in R^3\ndim_rotation = 3\n\n# Dimension from Galilean boosts (x' = x + vt) in R^3\ndim_galilean_boost = 3\n\n# Dimension from scaling transformations\ndim_scaling = 1\n\n# Calculate the total dimension of the Lie group\ntotal_dimension = (\n    dim_time_translation +\n    dim_space_translation +\n    dim_rotation +\n    dim_galilean_boost +\n    dim_scaling\n)\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.\n# The final equation shows each number being added.\nprint(\"The dimension is the sum of dimensions from:\")\nprint(\"- Time Translations:   \", dim_time_translation)\nprint(\"- Space Translations:  \", dim_space_translation)\nprint(\"- Spatial Rotations:   \", dim_rotation)\nprint(\"- Galilean Boosts:     \", dim_galilean_boost)\nprint(\"- Scaling:             \", dim_scaling)\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{dim_time_translation} + {dim_space_translation} + {dim_rotation} + {dim_galilean_boost} + {dim_scaling} = {total_dimension}\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
