    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. This space is a compact, smooth manifold of dimension $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$. It is diffeomorphic to $Gr_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\n2.  **Understand the question:** We need to find the \"rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\" $H^*(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The integral cohomology groups $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ can be written as a sum of a free part and a torsion part. The torsion part of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each group $H^i$. For real Grassmannians, all torsion is 2-torsion, meaning the torsion subgroups are direct sums of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The \"rank\" in this context refers to the total number of these $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands, which is the dimension of the torsion subgroup as a vector space over the field with two elements, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Use the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT):** The UCT for cohomology provides a relationship between integral cohomology and integral homology. Specifically, the torsion subgroup of the $i$-th cohomology group is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of the $(i-1)$-th homology group:\n    $Tors(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})) \\cong Tors(H_{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n    Therefore, the total rank we are looking for is the sum of the ranks of the torsion subgroups of the homology groups $H_j(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, 5$.\n\n4.  **Find the integral homology groups:** The integral homology groups of real Grassmannians are well-known results in algebraic topology. For $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5) \\cong Gr_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the homology groups are:\n    *   $H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_2 = 0$\n    *   $H_3 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H_5 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$\n    *   $H_6 = 0$ (The manifold is non-orientable).\n\n5.  **Calculate the final sum:** From the list of homology groups, we determine the rank of the torsion part for each dimension and sum them up. This final calculation will be performed by the Python script below.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n    of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5, which is the Grassmannian Gr_3(R^5).\n\n    The rank of the torsion subgroup of the cohomology ring H*(X; Z) is the sum\n    of the ranks of the torsion parts of each cohomology group H^i(X; Z).\n    All torsion in the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian is 2-torsion.\n    The rank of Tors(H^i) is its dimension as a Z/2Z vector space.\n\n    By the Universal Coefficient Theorem, Tors(H^i(X; Z)) is isomorphic to Tors(H_{i-1}(X; Z)).\n    So we need to sum the ranks of the torsion parts of the homology groups H_j(X; Z).\n\n    The integral homology groups of Gr_3(R^5) are known:\n    H_0 = Z                  -> Tors(H_0) = 0,             rank = 0\n    H_1 = Z/2Z               -> Tors(H_1) = Z/2Z,          rank = 1\n    H_2 = 0                  -> Tors(H_2) = 0,             rank = 0\n    H_3 = Z + Z/2Z           -> Tors(H_3) = Z/2Z,          rank = 1\n    H_4 = Z/2Z               -> Tors(H_4) = Z/2Z,          rank = 1\n    H_5 = Z + (Z/2Z)^2       -> Tors(H_5) = (Z/2Z)^2,      rank = 2\n    The manifold has dimension 6, so we sum the ranks for j=0 to 5.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Ranks of the torsion subgroups of the homology groups H_j for j = 0 to 5.\n    homology_torsion_ranks = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    # The total rank is the sum of these individual ranks.\n    total_rank = sum(homology_torsion_ranks)\n\n    print(\"The rank of the torsion subgroup of H^*(Gr_3(R^5); Z) is the sum of the ranks of Tors(H_j(Gr_3(R^5); Z)) for j=0..5.\")\n    print(\"The individual ranks are based on the known homology groups.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    \n    # Building the equation string with each number\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, homology_torsion_ranks))\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_rank}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is {total_rank}.\")\n\nsolve_torsion_rank()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
