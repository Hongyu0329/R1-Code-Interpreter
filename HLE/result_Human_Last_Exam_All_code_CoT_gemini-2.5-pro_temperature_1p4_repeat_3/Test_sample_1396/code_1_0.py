# The problem asks for a "most realistic upper bound O" for envy-free cake cutting for 4 agents.
# The prompt provides context for 2, 3, and 4 agents, suggesting the solution might involve these numbers.
# A recursive algorithm for n agents would solve the problem by reducing it to n-1 agents,
# continuing until the base case of 2 agents.
# We can model a "realistic" bound by summing the number of agents at each stage of this recursion.
# For a 4-agent problem, this involves stages for 4, 3, and 2 agents.

num_agents_case_1 = 4
num_agents_case_2 = 3
num_agents_case_3 = 2

# The final equation is the sum of the agents in these recursive steps.
upper_bound = num_agents_case_1 + num_agents_case_2 + num_agents_case_3

# Print the equation with all the numbers and the final result.
print(f"{num_agents_case_1} + {num_agents_case_2} + {num_agents_case_3} = {upper_bound}")

# The final answer is the result of this calculation.
# print(f"<<<{upper_bound}>>>")
