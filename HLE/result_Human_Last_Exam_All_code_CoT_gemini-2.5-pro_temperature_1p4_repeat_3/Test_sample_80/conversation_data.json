    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard and then subtract this number from the total number of edge squares.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares.** An 8x8 board has 4 sides, each with 8 squares. Since the 4 corner squares are counted twice, the total is (8 * 4) - 4 = 28.\n2.  **Determine the maximum number of bishops.** A key property of bishops is that they always stay on the same color square. Therefore, we can analyze the white edge squares and black edge squares separately.\n3.  **Analyze the edge squares by color.** The 28 edge squares are perfectly split into 14 white squares and 14 black squares.\n4.  **Find the placement limit.** On an 8x8 board, every edge square of a given color is diagonally aligned with exactly one other edge square of the same color. For example, the white corner square h1 attacks the white corner square a8. This means the 14 white edge squares form 7 attacking pairs. Similarly, the 14 black edge squares form 7 attacking pairs.\n5.  **Calculate the maximum bishops.** Since we can only place one bishop per attacking pair, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place is 7 on the white squares and 7 on the black squares, for a total of 14 bishops.\n6.  **Calculate the empty squares.** The number of edge squares that lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the maximum number of bishops placed.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the size of the chessboard.\nboard_size = 8\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number of edge squares on the board.\n# Formula: (squares per side * 4 sides) - 4 corners (to avoid double-counting).\ntotal_edge_squares = (board_size * 4) - 4\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge.\n# On an N x N board (where N is even), the edge squares of each color can be formed into pairs\n# where the squares in each pair attack each other. Therefore, you can only place one bishop\n# per pair. The maximum number of bishops is half the total number of edge squares.\nmax_bishops = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of edge squares that will remain empty.\nempty_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops\n\n# Step 5: Print the final equation and the answer.\nprint(\"This problem can be solved by first finding the total number of edge squares,\")\nprint(\"then finding the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them.\")\nprint(\"The number of empty squares is the difference between these two values.\")\nprint(\"\\nEquation:\")\nprint(f\"Total Edge Squares ({total_edge_squares}) - Max Bishops ({max_bishops}) = Empty Squares ({empty_squares})\")\nprint(f\"\\nSo, {empty_squares} edge squares would lack bishops.\")\n\n```\n<<<14>>>"
