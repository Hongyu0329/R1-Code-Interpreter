For n = 0, the number of 0-simplices is C(0 + 200 + 13 + 1, 0 + 1) = C(214, 1) = 214
For n = 1, the number of 1-simplices is C(1 + 200 + 13 + 1, 1 + 1) = C(215, 2) = 23005
For n = 2, the number of 2-simplices is C(2 + 200 + 13 + 1, 2 + 1) = C(216, 3) = 1656360
For n = 3, the number of 3-simplices is C(3 + 200 + 13 + 1, 3 + 1) = C(217, 4) = 89255490
For n = 4, the number of 4-simplices is C(4 + 200 + 13 + 1, 4 + 1) = C(218, 5) = 3848585252
For n = 5, the number of 5-simplices is C(5 + 200 + 13 + 1, 5 + 1) = C(219, 6) = 139369383184
