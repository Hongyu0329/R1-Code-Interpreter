    Calculates the number of n-simplices for the given problem parameters.
    
    The problem asks for the number of n-simplices in the over infinity-category
    N(Z_N)_{k/}. An n-simplex in this category corresponds to a sequence of
    integers j_0, j_1, ..., j_n such that -N <= j_0 <= j_1 <= ... <= j_n <= k.
    
    This is a combinatorial problem of choosing n+1 numbers from the set
    {-N, -N+1, ..., k} with replacement. The size of this set is M = k - (-N) + 1.
    The number of items to choose is K = n+1.
    
    Using the stars and bars formula, the number of ways is given by the
    binomial coefficient C(K + M - 1, K), which simplifies to
    C((n+1) + (k+N+1) - 1, n+1) = C(n + N + k + 1, n + 1).
