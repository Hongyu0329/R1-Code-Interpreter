    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Structure of Dirichlet Characters:**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with a composite conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ can be uniquely represented as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi_i$, where each $\\chi_i$ has the conductor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$.\n\n**2. State the Problem's Conditions:**\nWe are given $N = 36036$ and we need to find the number of primitive characters with conductor $N$ and order 6.\n\n*   First, we find the prime factorization of $N$: $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n*   For a character $\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ to have order 6, two conditions must be met:\n    1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must divide 6.\n    2.  The lcm of their orders must be exactly 6. This means the set of prime factors of the orders must include both 2 and 3.\n\n**3. Count Valid Component Characters for Each Factor:**\nFor each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we need to count how many primitive characters modulo $p^a$ have an order that divides 6. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ is $\\phi(d)$ if $d|m$, and 0 otherwise.\n\n*   **For conductor 4 ($2^2$):** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It has one primitive character of order 2. Since 2 divides 6, there is **1** choice.\n*   **For conductor 9 ($3^2$):** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The primitive characters are those with orders 3 and 6. Both orders divide 6. The number of choices is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$.\n*   **For conductor 7:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. The primitive characters are those with orders 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6. The number of choices is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n*   **For conductor 11:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need primitive characters whose order divides both 10 and 6. The only such order greater than 1 is 2. The number of choices is $\\phi(2) = \\mathbf{1}$.\n*   **For conductor 13:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need primitive characters whose order divides both 12 and 6. These orders are 2, 3, and 6. The number of choices is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n**4. Combine the Results:**\nWe need to form a character $\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ by choosing one valid component character for each conductor. Let's check the lcm condition:\n*   Any choice for conductor 9 will have an order divisible by 3.\n*   Any choice for conductor 4 (or 7, 11, 13) will have an order divisible by 2.\n*   Therefore, the lcm of the orders of any combination of these chosen characters will be divisible by both 2 and 3, making it 6.\n\nSo, the total number of characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nTotal = (choices for 4) × (choices for 9) × (choices for 7) × (choices for 11) × (choices for 13)\nTotal = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_character_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    # Prime factorization of N is 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13\n\n    print(f\"To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order 6,\")\n    print(\"we first find the prime factorization of N: 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13.\")\n    print(\"We then count the number of available primitive characters for each prime power factor whose order divides 6.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Number of choices for each prime power factor, based on number theoretic calculations.\n    # phi(2)=1, phi(3)=2, phi(6)=2\n\n    # Conductor 4 = 2^2: 1 primitive character of order 2. 2 divides 6.\n    count_4 = 1\n    print(f\"For conductor 4 (2^2), there is {count_4} choice.\")\n\n    # Conductor 9 = 3^2: primitive characters have orders 3 and 6.\n    # Choices = (num of order 3) + (num of order 6) = phi(3) + phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4\n    count_9 = 2 + 2\n    print(f\"For conductor 9 (3^2), there are {count_9} choices.\")\n\n    # Conductor 7: primitive characters have orders 2, 3, 6.\n    # Choices = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n    count_7 = 1 + 2 + 2\n    print(f\"For conductor 7, there are {count_7} choices.\")\n\n    # Conductor 11: primitive characters with order dividing 6 can only have order 2.\n    # Choices = phi(2) = 1\n    count_11 = 1\n    print(f\"For conductor 11, there is {count_11} choice.\")\n\n    # Conductor 13: primitive characters with order dividing 6 can have orders 2, 3, 6.\n    # Choices = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n    count_13 = 1 + 2 + 2\n    print(f\"For conductor 13, there are {count_13} choices.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # The total number is the product of these counts.\n    total_count = count_4 * count_9 * count_7 * count_11 * count_13\n\n    print(\"The total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each factor:\")\n    print(f\"Total = {count_4} * {count_9} * {count_7} * {count_11} * {count_13} = {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_character_count()\n```\n<<<100>>>"
