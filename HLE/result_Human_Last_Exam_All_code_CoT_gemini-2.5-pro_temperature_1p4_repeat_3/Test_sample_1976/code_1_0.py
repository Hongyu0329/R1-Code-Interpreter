    Calculates and prints the 1-norm of the correlation matrix T for J_n for given odd n.

    The problem asks for the 1-norm of the correlation matrix T for a bipartite quantum state J_n,
    where n is an odd integer. The state is constructed from n+1 copies of 2-qubit projectors.
    Through a detailed derivation involving decomposition into Pauli operators and summation over all
    correlation terms, the 1-norm is found to follow a concise formula dependent on n.

    The derived formula is: ||T||_1 = 4**(n+1) - 2**(n+1).

    This function takes a list of integers, checks if they are odd, and then calculates the norm
    for each valid n, printing the steps of the calculation.
