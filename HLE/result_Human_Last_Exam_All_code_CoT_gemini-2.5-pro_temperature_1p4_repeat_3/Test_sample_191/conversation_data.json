    "The user is asking a biological question but wants the answer delivered through a script. I will create a Python script that stores the answer in a variable and then prints an explanation of the biological process.\n\nThe protein in question is part of the complement system, a component of the innate immune system. When this system is activated by the presence of amyloid plaques, a key protein called Complement C3 is cleaved, or \"broken down\". One of its fragments, C3b, coats the surface of the amyloid. This coating, known as opsonization, acts as a tag that macrophages can recognize, leading to the engulfment (phagocytosis) of the amyloid.\n\nThe script will define this protein and explain its role.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the role of a key protein\n    that, when broken down, facilitates the macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein = \"Complement C3\"\n    active_fragment = \"C3b\"\n    process = \"opsonization\"\n\n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is {protein}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(f\"The {protein} protein is a key part of the complement system.\")\n    print(f\"When this system is activated, {protein} is cleaved (broken down) into fragments, including {active_fragment}.\")\n    print(f\"The {active_fragment} fragment then coats the amyloid plaque.
