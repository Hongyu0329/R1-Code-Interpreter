def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the indices of insect tribes whose
    immatures are unlikely to be collected using a beat-sheet method.

    The analysis is as follows:
    - 1) Apis: Immatures are in hives, not on foliage. Unlikely.
    - 2) Melipotini: Immatures are foliage-feeding caterpillars. Likely.
    - 3) Eupholini: Immatures are internal-boring weevil grubs. Unlikely.
    - 4) Acritini: Immatures live in dung, carrion, or leaf litter. Unlikely.
    - 5) Oxyptilini: Immatures are foliage-feeding caterpillars. Likely.
    - 6) Dictyophorini: Immatures are sap-sucking nymphs on plants. Likely.
    - 7) Acanthocerini: Immatures live in rotting wood or with social insects. Unlikely.
