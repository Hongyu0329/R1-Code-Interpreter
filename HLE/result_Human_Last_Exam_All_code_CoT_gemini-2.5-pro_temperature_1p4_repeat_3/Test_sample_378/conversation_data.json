    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a factual inaccuracy. Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. He has never publicly used or identified with the name \"Azikiwe\". Nnamdi Azikiwe was a separate, prominent Nigerian statesman and the first President of Nigeria.\n\nTherefore, the event the user is asking about never occurred.\n\nI will provide a Python script that clarifies this information. The script will check if \"Azikiwe\" is in Goodluck Jonathan's known name and print an explanatory statement.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's query about Goodluck Jonathan and the name 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    full_name_jonathan = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_in_question = \"Azikiwe\"\n\n    # The premise of the question is that \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n    # We will check if this is true and provide an explanation.\n    if name_in_question.lower() not in full_name_jonathan.lower():\n        print(\"Based on available records, there is no year when Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified as 'Azikiwe'.\")\n        print(f\"His full name is {full_name_jonathan}.\")\n        print(\"The name 'Azikiwe' is associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\")\n        print(\"Therefore, the event described in the question did not happen.\")\n    else:\n        # This part of the code is unlikely to execute\n        print(f\"Found '{name_in_question}' in the name '{full_name_jonathan}'.\")\n\ncheck_name_and_explain()\n```\n<<<Goodluck Ebele Jonathan never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe, as that is not part of his name.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
