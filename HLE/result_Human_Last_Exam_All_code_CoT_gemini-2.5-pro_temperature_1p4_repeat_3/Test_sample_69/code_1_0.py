    # Step 1: Analyze clues for the word "көк".
    print("1. Analyze the context of the word 'көк' from the examples:")
    print("   - In sentences 0 ('Көктемнен...') and 1 ('Көктем...'), 'көк' is the root of the word for 'spring'. Spring is a natural season known for its green grass and leaves.")
    print("   - In sentences 4 ('Көкке...') and 5 ('...көктің...'), 'көк' refers to the 'sky' or 'heavens', which is also a natural element.")
    print("   - Conclusion: The examples link 'көк' directly to natural things.")
    print()

    # Step 2: Analyze clues related to "жасыл".
    print("2. Analyze contrasting clues:")
    print("   - In sentence 3, the word 'Жасанды' translates to 'Artificial'. This word implies a connection to things that are man-made.")
    print("   - This suggests 'жасыл', a phonetically similar word, is used for non-natural, or man-made, green objects, contrasting with the natural context of 'көк'.")
    print()

    # Step 3: Synthesize the findings and evaluate the options.
    print("3. Synthesize the findings and choose the best option:")
    print("   - The evidence points to a rule based on a 'natural vs. non-natural' distinction.")
    print("   - Let's evaluate Choice H: '\"Көк\" can be used only for something natural like grass or tree leafs.'")
    print("   - This rule perfectly aligns with our analysis. It correctly identifies the specific, limited scope of 'көк' when it means green.")
    print("   - By knowing that 'көк' is for natural things, you know to use 'жасыл' for artificial things (like a green car) and as the general, all-purpose word for green.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Final Answer
    print("The final answer is H.")
    print("<<<H>>>")
