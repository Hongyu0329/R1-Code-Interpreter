# Step 1: Set up the problem based on the poem's initial statements.
# Let T be the total number of pipes.
# The number of pipes in tune (IT) is given. Let's assume it's a variable for now.
# The out-of-tune pipes (OOT) are given as fractions of the total.
# OOT = (1/3)T + (2/5)T = (5/15)T + (6/15)T = (11/15)T
# The total pipes T = IT + OOT => T = IT + (11/15)T => IT = (4/15)T

# Step 2: The poem states IT = 200, but this leads to a mathematical contradiction later.
# The group of 'lost' pipes (L) is T/3, and it must be divisible by lcm(7, 4) = 28.
# If IT=200, T = (15/4)*200 = 750. L = 750/3 = 250. 250 is not divisible by 28.
# We infer the intended numbers that make the riddle solvable.
# Let's find a total T that works. T must be a multiple of 15 (from the OOT fraction).
# The 'lost' pipes, L = T/3, must be a multiple of 28.
# So, T/3 = 28 * k for some integer k. This means T must be a multiple of 3 * 28 = 84.
# We need T to be a multiple of both 15 and 84.
# lcm(15, 84) = lcm(3*5, 3*4*7) = 3*4*5*7 = 420.
# Let's test the smallest possible valid Total, T=420.
# OOT = (11/15)*420 = 11*28 = 308. IT = 420 - 308 = 112.
# Let's test the next multiple, T = 840.
# OOT = (11/15)*840 = 11*56 = 616. IT = 840 - 616 = 224.
# 224 is very close to the 200 mentioned in the poem, making this the most likely intended scenario.

# Step 3: Perform the calculation using the consistent numbers.
total_pipes_T = 840
in_tune_pipes_IT = 224
out_of_tune_pipes_OOT = total_pipes_T - in_tune_pipes_IT

# The group that "lost their perfect pitch" (L) is the group that "fell out of tune".
lost_pipes_L = total_pipes_T // 3

# The final question asks for half of the 'lost' pipes.
tuner_finds = lost_pipes_L // 2

# Output the reasoning and the final calculation.
print("To solve the riddle consistently, we infer the total number of pipes.")
print(f"Let the total number of pipes be T = {total_pipes_T}.")
print(f"The number of pipes in tune would be ({4}/{15})*T = {in_tune_pipes_IT}, which is close to the 200 in the poem.")
print(f"The number of pipes that 'lost their perfect pitch' is L = T/3.")
print(f"L = {total_pipes_T} / 3 = {lost_pipes_L}")
print("This number is divisible by 28, making the rest of the poem's fractions work.")
print("\nThe final question is how many pipes the tuner must find if half the lost are realigned.")
print(f"The calculation is: {lost_pipes_L} / 2 = {tuner_finds}")
