def solve_closepact_sets():
    """
    This function determines which of the given sets are necessarily "closepact".

    The reasoning is based on the following logical steps:
    1. The definition of "closepact" provided is equivalent to the topological property of being H-closed.
    2. All the spaces in question are subspaces of R or C, which are regular spaces.
    3. For regular spaces, being H-closed is equivalent to being compact.
    4. By the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of R or C is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
    5. Therefore, we identify which of the sets are necessarily closed and bounded.

    - A. R: Not bounded.
    - B. Z: Not bounded.
    - C. Finite subset of C: Closed and bounded. (Yes)
    - D. {1/n | n != 0}: Bounded but not closed.
    - E. Cauchy sequence in Q: Not necessarily closed.
    - F. Bounded monotonic sequence: Not necessarily closed.
    - G. Bounded monotonic sequence + limit: Closed and bounded. (Yes)
    - H. Positive sequence + limit: Closed and bounded. (Yes)
    - I. Open interval: Not closed.
    - J. Closed interval: Closed and bounded. (Yes)
    - K. Bounded measurable set: Not necessarily closed.
    - L. Bounded non-measurable set: Not necessarily closed.
    - M. Cantor Set: Closed and bounded. (Yes)

    The correct choices are C, G, H, J, and M.
