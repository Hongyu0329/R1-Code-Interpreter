    This function determines the largest number of components X \ C can have.
    
    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c (the continuum).
    Let A be a connected subset of X.
    Let C be a component of X \ A.
    
    The question is the maximum number of components of X \ C.
    
    1. A lower bound can be established with an example in R^2 yielding a countably
       infinite (Aleph_0) number of components.
    
    2. An upper bound is the cardinality of the space itself, which is c.
    
    3. It is possible to construct a valid (though non-metrizable) topological
       space X that satisfies all the conditions and for which the number of
       components of X \ C is exactly c.
       
    Therefore, the largest possible number of components is c, the cardinality
    of the continuum.
