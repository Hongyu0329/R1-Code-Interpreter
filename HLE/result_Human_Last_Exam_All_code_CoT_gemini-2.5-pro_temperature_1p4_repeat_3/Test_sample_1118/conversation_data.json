    "My plan is to first research the 1933 self-portrait by the German artist Curt Querner. I will identify the specific painting created after his escape from the Gestapo and determine the object he is depicted holding. This object is widely interpreted as a symbol of his resistance. I will then present this information in a simple Python script that prints the answer, as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the object held by Curt Querner in his 1933 self-portrait\n    as a symbol of resistance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # After being arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo in March 1933,\n    # Curt Querner painted a self-portrait titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\"\n    # (Self-Portrait with Pipe).\n    \n    # In this painting, he holds a pipe in his hand.\n    held_object = \"a pipe\"\n    \n    # His direct, defiant gaze combined with the simple, everyday act of holding a pipe\n    # is interpreted as a symbol of his unbroken spirit and quiet resistance to the Nazi regime.\n    \n    print(\"In his 1933 self-portrait painted after his ordeal with the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds the following object in his hand as a symbol of resistance:\")\n    print(held_object)\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a pipe>>>"
