    "Of course, I can help you with that. This is a problem in algebraic geometry, specifically concerning the properties of symmetric powers of curves. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the variety:** The variety in question is $X = C^{(15)}$, the 15th symmetric power of a genus $g=3$ curve $C$.\n2.  **Relate the Néron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C:** The symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is closely related to the Jacobian variety of the curve, $\\mathrm{Jac}(C)$. For a sufficiently large degree $d$, there is a simple relationship between the ranks of their Néron-Severi groups (also known as their Picard numbers, $\\rho$). The specific relation, valid for $d \\ge 2g-1$, is $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(\\mathrm{Jac}(C)) + 1$.\n3.  **Check the condition:** For our problem, $g=3$ and $d=15$. We must verify that $15 \\ge 2(3)-1 = 5$. Since the condition holds, we can use the formula.\n4.  **Find the range of ranks for the Jacobian:** The problem now reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(\\mathrm{Jac}(C))$ for a genus 3 curve.\n    *   **Minimum Rank:** For a *generic* genus 3 curve, its Jacobian has the minimal number of algebraic cycles. In this case, the endomorphism ring is just the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, and the Néron-Severi rank is 1, generated by the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n    *   **Maximum Rank:** The rank is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(\\mathrm{Jac}(C))$, which for an abelian variety of dimension $g$ is $g^2$. For $g=3$, this is $3^2=9$. This maximum value is achieved for very special curves, such as the Fermat quartic curve ($x^4+y^4=z^4=0$), whose Jacobian has complex multiplication and its Néron-Severi rank is 9.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:** Using the formula from step 2 and the minimum/maximum values from step 4, we can compute the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\mathrm{NS}(X)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements the final calculation based on this plan.\n\n```python\n# Let C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X its 15th symmetric power.\n# This script calculates the smallest and the largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n# Define the parameters based on the problem statement\ng = 3  # genus of the curve C\nd = 15 # degree of the symmetric power X\n\n# The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, rho(X), is related to the rank\n# of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(Jac(C)).\n# The condition d >= 2g - 1 is met (15 >= 5), so we can use the formula:\n# rho(X) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1\n\n# --- Smallest Rank Calculation ---\n# The smallest possible rank for rho(Jac(C)) of a genus g=3 curve is 1.\nmin_rho_jac = 1\nsmallest_rank_X = min_rho_jac + 1\n\nprint(\"Smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X:\")\nprint(\"rho_min(X) = rho_min(Jac(C)) + 1 = {} + 1 = {}\".format(min_rho_jac, smallest_rank_X))\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# --- Largest Rank Calculation ---\n# The largest possible rank for rho(Jac(C)) of a genus g=3 curve is g^2.\nmax_rho_jac = g**2\nlargest_rank_X = max_rho_jac + 1\n\nprint(\"Largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X:\")\nprint(\"rho_max(X) = rho_max(Jac(C)) + 1 = {} + 1 = {}\".format(max_rho_jac, largest_rank_X))\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.\")\n```\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n<<<(2, 10)>>>"
