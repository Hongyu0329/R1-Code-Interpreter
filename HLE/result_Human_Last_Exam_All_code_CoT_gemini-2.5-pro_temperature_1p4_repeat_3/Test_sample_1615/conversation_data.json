    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Let $n$ be the number of vertices, so $n = 12345$.\n2.  The chromatic number of a graph, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring. The question asks for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ under the given constraints.\n3.  I will first establish an upper bound for $\\chi(G)$. For any graph with $n$ vertices, it is known that $\\chi(G) \\le n$. Furthermore, $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$.\n4.  Since the problem states that $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This gives us the upper bound $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n5.  Next, I need to show that this upper bound can be achieved. I will construct a graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $n-1$. A simple example is a graph consisting of a complete subgraph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and one additional isolated vertex. This graph is not complete, and its chromatic number is $n-1$.\n6.  This proves that the maximum number of colors required is exactly $n-1$.\n7.  Finally, I will write a Python script to perform the calculation and print the result along with the reasoning. The script will output the numbers involved in the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph with\n    12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the problem.\")\n    print(f\"We have a graph G with n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is not a complete graph (K_n), where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the maximum possible number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring, which is the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, chi(G).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Find an upper bound for the number of colors.\")\n    print(f\"For any graph with n vertices, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n.\")\n    print(f\"A graph needs n colors (i.e., chi(G) = n) if and only if it is the complete graph K_n.\")\n    print(f\"Since G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than n.\")\n    print(f\"So, chi(G) <= n - 1.
