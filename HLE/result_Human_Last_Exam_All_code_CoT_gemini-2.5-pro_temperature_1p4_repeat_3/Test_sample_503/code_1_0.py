# Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem statement.
# We are looking for adjunctions from [m] to [n].
m = 23
n = 37

# Step 2: According to the combinatorial analysis, the number of such
# adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(m+n, n).
# We define the parameters for this calculation.
N = m + n
K = n

# Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient using the math.comb function.
result = math.comb(N, K)

# Step 4: Print the final equation and its result, showing all the numbers involved.
