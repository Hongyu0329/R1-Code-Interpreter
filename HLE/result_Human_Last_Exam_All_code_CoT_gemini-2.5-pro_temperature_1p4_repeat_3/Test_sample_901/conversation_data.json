    "The user wants to identify the major product of an organic chemistry reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemical Requirements:** The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an *anti-periplanar* orientation. In a cyclohexane ring, this means both groups must be in axial positions.\n3.  **Determine Reactive Conformation:** The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *cis* isomer. For the E2 reaction to occur, it must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is axial. In this conformation, the methyl group will be equatorial.\n4.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways (Regiochemistry):** With the bromine in an axial position, there are two different beta-hydrogens available for elimination that are also in an axial position:\n    *   **Path A (Zaitsev):** The axial hydrogen on carbon-2. Removing this hydrogen would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (thermodynamically more stable) alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Path B (Hofmann):** The axial hydrogen on carbon-6. Removing this hydrogen would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n5.  **Apply the Bulky Base Rule:** Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, sterically hindered base. Due to its size, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically crowded beta-hydrogen on carbon-2 (which is adjacent to the methyl group). It will preferentially attack the more accessible, less hindered beta-hydrogen on carbon-6.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The reaction will favor the Hofmann elimination pathway, making **3-methylcyclohexene** the major product. I will create a Python script to explain these steps and print the final product name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the product of the reaction between\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Reaction Analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.
