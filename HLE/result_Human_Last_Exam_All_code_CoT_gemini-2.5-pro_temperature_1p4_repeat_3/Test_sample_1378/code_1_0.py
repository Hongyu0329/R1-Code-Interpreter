    Analyzes the local sentiment following the 1907 Kingston earthquake diplomatic incident.

    explanation = """
Historical analysis of the 1907 Kingston earthquake aftermath reveals the following:

1.  The Incident: A major earthquake devastated Kingston, Jamaica. The United States sent naval ships with humanitarian aid. The British Governor of Jamaica, Sir Alexander Swettenham, rudely rejected the American aid, causing a diplomatic crisis.

2.  Local Reaction: The response of the local Jamaican elite and press, as documented in newspapers like *The Gleaner*, was crucial. They initially praised Governor Swettenham's firm stance. This support was rooted in a sense of national/colonial pride and loyalty to the British Empire.

3.  Underlying Sentiment: The American presence was viewed with suspicion. At the time, U.S. interventionism in the Caribbean (e.g., the Platt Amendment in Cuba, the Panama Canal Zone) made many wary of American intentions. The local population, particularly the influential classes, saw the uninvited landing of American sailors as an affront to British sovereignty. They preferred to handle the crisis within the framework of the British Empire, demonstrating a loyalty to the existing colonial administration over perceived American overreach.

4.  Conclusion: Based on this, the view of the local population is best represented as that of loyal British subjects who were resistant to American intervention.

Therefore, the best answer is C.
