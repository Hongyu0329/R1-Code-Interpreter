    Calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for a specified Lagrangian.

    The problem asks for the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks in CP^4 with
    boundary on the iterated monotone Biran circle bundle lift of a Chekanov torus
    from CP^2.

    The calculation proceeds as follows:
    1. The Chekanov torus in CP^2 has 2 Maslov 2 disks. This is our starting point.
    2. The first Biran lift, from CP^2 to CP^3, adds 1 disk.
    3. The second Biran lift, from CP^3 to CP^4, adds another 1 disk.
