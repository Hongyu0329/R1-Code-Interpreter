    Solves the theoretical questions about dessins d'enfants and group theory.
    
    (a) True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, then N must act semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    (b) State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering of D_N where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G').
    (c) Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
