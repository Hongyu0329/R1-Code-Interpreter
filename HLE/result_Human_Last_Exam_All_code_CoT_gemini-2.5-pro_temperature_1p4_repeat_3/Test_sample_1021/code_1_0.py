    print("  - C (Use Nitrogen Atmosphere): This directly addresses the critical issue of oxidation. By removing oxygen, the hydroquinone anion is protected, allowing it to react as intended.")
    print("  - D (Use K2CO3): This is a weaker base. It would be less effective at deprotonation, likely worsening the problem.")
