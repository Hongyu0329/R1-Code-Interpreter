# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the dissolution of the USSR.
# A graph of countries on a map is a planar graph. By the Four Color Theorem, the chromatic number is at most 4.
# Given the high complexity of the borders in Asia, the graph is not 3-colorable.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution (X_before) is {chromatic_number_before}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution.
# The dissolution added new countries but did not change the graph's planar nature.
# The complexity did not decrease, so the graph still requires 4 colors.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph after the Soviet dissolution (X_after) is {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the change in the chromatic number (delta_soviet).
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is X_after - X_before = {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine the change in planarity (beta).
# A map of contiguous countries is a planar graph. Subdividing a region does not change planarity.
# As the planarity did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, so beta = {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")

# Final answer in specified format
print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
