    "To solve this problem, we need to use the topological rules for Feynman diagrams in a specific field theory.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** The problem specifies an \"interacting scalar field theory.\" The simplest and most common interaction for such a theory is a quartic interaction (often called $\\phi^4$ theory), where each vertex connects exactly four lines (propagators).\n2.  **Use Topological Formulas:** We will use two key formulas that relate the properties of a Feynman diagram:\n    *   The formula for the number of loops (L): `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   A formula connecting the number of lines at each vertex to the total lines: `4 * V = 2 * I + E`\n    *   Where:\n        *   `V` is the number of vertices.\n        *   `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators).\n        *   `E` is the number of external lines (incoming/outgoing particles).\n        *   `L` is the number of loops.\n3.  **Solve for V:** We are given that `L=2`. We will combine the two equations to create a single relationship between the number of vertices (`V`) and external lines (`E`).\n4.  **Minimize V:** To find the minimum possible number of vertices, we must consider the minimum possible number of external lines (`E`). The smallest number of external lines a diagram can have is zero (`E=0`), which represents a vacuum diagram. By substituting `L=2` and `E=0`, we can solve for the minimum `V`.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a scalar phi^4 theory by applying topological rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script determines the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"The theory is an interacting scalar field theory, which we'll assume is phi^4 theory.\")\n    print(\"In phi^4 theory, every vertex connects to exactly 4 lines.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the fundamental equations\n    print(\"Step 1: State the fundamental topological equations for a diagram.\")\n    print(\"  a) Loop formula: L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(\"  b) Vertex line-counting formula: 4 * V = 2 * I + E\")\n    print(\"  (L=loops, I=internal lines, V=vertices, E=external lines)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Set the given number of loops\n    L = 2\n    print(f\"Step 2: We are given that the diagram has two loops, so L = {L}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the equations to relate V and E\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the equations to find a direct relationship between V and E.\")\n    print(\"From the loop formula, we can express the number of internal lines (I) as:\")\n    print(\"  I = L + V - 1\")\n    print(\"Substitute this into the vertex formula:\")\n    print(\"  4 * V = 2 * (L + V - 1) + E\")\n    print(\"Now, substitute L = 2 into this combined equation:\")\n    print(f\"  4 * V = 2 * ({L} + V - 1) + E\")\n    print(f\"  4 * V = 2 * ({L-1} + V) + E\")\n    print(f\"  4 * V = {2*(L-1)} + 2 * V + E\")\n    print(\"Rearranging the terms to solve for V gives:\")\n    print(f\"  2 * V = {2*(L-1)} + E\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Minimize V by minimizing E\n    print(\"Step 4: To find the minimum V, we must use the minimum possible E.\")\n    print(\"The minimum number of external lines a diagram can have is 0 (a 'vacuum bubble').\")\n    E_min = 0\n    print(f\"We set E = {E_min}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the final value for V\n    print(\"Step 5: Calculate the minimum number of vertices (V).\")\n    # Equation from above: 2 * V = 2 * (L - 1) + E\n    # With L=2 and E=0:\n    target_value = 2 * (L - 1) + E_min\n    min_V = target_value / 2\n\n    print(f\"  2 * V = {2*(L-1)} + {E_min}\")\n    print(f\"  2 * V = {int(target_value)}\")\n    print(f\"  V = {int(min_V)}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis calculation shows that a two-loop diagram can exist with just one vertex.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a 'figure-eight' vacuum diagram, where two loops start and end at the same single vertex, satisfying the 4-line connection rule.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices is 1.\")\n\nsolve_feynman_vertices()\n<<<1>>>"
