    "The correct answer is the European Tango. I will write a Python script to explain the reasoning.\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the fundamental techniques that differentiate the dance styles. The swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) use body swing, sway, rise, and fall to generate momentum, which can be used to overturn figures. The European Tango, however, is built on a \"no swing\" technique. It's characterized by staccato actions, keeping the feet in contact with the floor, and having no rise and fall. Attempting to add extra rotation (overturn) to a reverse turn would force the dancers to use momentum and swing, which fundamentally violates and disregards the core technique of the Tango.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the technical requirements of different ballroom dances\n    to determine which one makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without\n    violating its core technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrot',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    # Analysis of dance techniques\n    analysis = \"\"\"\n    1. Swing Dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep): These dances are defined by their use of 'swing,' which involves momentum, body sway, and rise & fall. This flowing quality allows for figures to be modified and overturned, as the core technique supports momentum-based rotation.\n\n    2. Tango: The European Tango is fundamentally a 'no swing' dance. Its technique is characterized by sharp, staccato movements, a level body position with no rise and fall, and a 'walking' action where feet remain close to the floor.\n\n    3. The Reverse Turn: In a Tango Reverse Turn, the rotation is executed with precision and control, without the aid of swing or momentum. Attempting to 'overturn' this figure would require introducing swing, which is a direct violation of the foundational Tango technique. It would cease to be a correct Tango figure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    correct_choice = 'C'\n    final_answer = options[correct_choice]\n\n    print(\"The Question:\")\n    print(question)\n    print(\"\\nOptions:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- REASONING ---\")\n    print(analysis)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- CONCLUSION ---\")\n    print(f\"In the European Tango, the lack of swing and momentum as part of its core technique makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn correctly.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\")\n    # Fulfilling the requirement to output the 'equation' or final selection\n    print(f\"Answer Choice = {correct_choice}\")\n    print(f\"Dance = {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_dance_question()\n<<<C>>>"
