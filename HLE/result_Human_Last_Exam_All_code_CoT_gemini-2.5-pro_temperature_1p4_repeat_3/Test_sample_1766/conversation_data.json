    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculations.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`. As it's an electron, its spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, results from the coupling of orbital and spin angular momenta. The possible values of `j` are determined by the rule: `j` ranges from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues of J²:** The operator for the square of the total angular momentum, $J^2$, has eigenvalues given by the formula `ħ² * j * (j + 1)`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant. We will calculate this for each possible value of `j`.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues of Jz:** The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum, $J_z$, has eigenvalues given by the formula `ħ * m_j`. The quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. For each `j`, we will find all possible `m_j` values and their corresponding eigenvalues.\n5.  **Present the Results:** The code will iterate through each possible `j` value, calculate the single $J^2$ eigenvalue for that `j` multiplet, and then calculate and list all corresponding $J_z$ eigenvalues.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # orbital angular momentum quantum number\n    s = 0.5  # spin angular momentum quantum number\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, the quantum numbers are l = {l} and s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 55)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers, j\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are:\")\n    for j_val in j_values:\n        print(f\"j = {j_val}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 55)\n\n    print(\"The common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z are found for each j-multiplet:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 55)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Calculate and print the eigenvalues for each multiplet\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the J^2 eigenvalue\n        j_squared_eigenvalue_num = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the j = {j} multiplet:\")\n        \n        # Format the J^2 eigenvalue as a fraction for clean output\n        j2_frac = Fraction(j_squared_eigenvalue_num).limit_denominator()\n        j2_str = f\"({j2_frac.numerator}/{j2_frac.denominator})ħ²\"\n        \n        # Output the J^2 eigenvalue including the calculation\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ² = {j}({j}+1.0)ħ² = {j2_str}\")\n        \n        # Calculate the corresponding J_z eigenvalues\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"  The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz (m_j * ħ) are:\")\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # Format the J_z eigenvalue as a fraction\n            mj_frac = Fraction(mj).limit_denominator()\n            jz_str = f\"({mj_frac.numerator}/{mj_frac.denominator})ħ\"\n            \n            # Output the J_z eigenvalue for each m_j\n            print(f\"    For m_j = {mj: >4.1f}, the eigenvalue is {jz_str}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 55)\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```"
