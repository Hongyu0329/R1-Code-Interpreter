    Identifies and prints the two nouns from Chomsky's examples.

    In Chapter 2 of "Syntactic Structures" (1957), after introducing
    "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" (correct syntax, no meaning) and
    "Furiously sleep ideas green colorless" (incorrect syntax), Chomsky
    provides another example to support his argument.

    He presents a pair of sentences which are nonsensical but syntactically correct:
    - "sincerity may frighten the boy."
    - "the boy may be frightened by sincerity."

    The last syntactically *correct* example he gives in this argument is this pair.
    The last syntactically *incorrect* example is "Furiously sleep ideas green colorless."

    The two nouns used in the final syntactically correct example pair are "sincerity" and "boy".
    The noun in the incorrect sentence is "ideas".

    The question asks for two nouns. The clearest answer is the two nouns from the final
    grammatical example Chomsky uses in this section.
