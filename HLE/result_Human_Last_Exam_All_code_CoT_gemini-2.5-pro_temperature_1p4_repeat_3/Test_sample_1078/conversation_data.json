    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider how such groups can be constructed.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Decomposition Principle:** Any finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of the product group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n2.  **Counting Irreducible Groups:** We first need to find the number of non-isomorphic *irreducible* finite Weyl groups for each relevant rank. These are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams:\n    *   **Rank 1:** A₁ (1 group)\n    *   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂ (which is isomorphic to C₂), G₂ (3 groups)\n    *   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (isomorphic to C₃) (2 groups)\n    *   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄ (isomorphic to C₄), D₄, F₄ (4 groups)\n3.  **Partitions of Rank 4:** Our problem reduces to finding all the ways to combine irreducible groups such that their ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the integer partitions of 4.\n    *   4\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n4.  **Calculate Combinations:** For each partition, we will calculate the number of distinct Weyl groups that can be formed.\n    *   For a partition with distinct ranks (e.g., 3 + 1), we multiply the number of available groups for each rank.\n    *   For a partition with repeated ranks (e.g., 2 + 2), we use the \"combinations with repetition\" formula: `C(n + k - 1, k)`, where `n` is the number of types of groups and `k` is the number of times we choose from them.\n5.  **Sum the Totals:** The final answer is the sum of the counts from each partition.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, calculating the number of groups for each partition and summing them to find the total.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_repetition(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates C(n + k - 1, k), the number of ways to choose k items from n types with repetition.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0 and k > 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\n# Step 1: Define the number of non-isomorphic IRREDUCIBLE Weyl groups for each rank\nirreducible_counts = {\n    1: 1,  # A_1\n    2: 3,  # A_2, B_2, G_2\n    3: 2,  # A_3, B_3\n    4: 4   # A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n}\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of groups for each partition of 4\ntotal_groups = 0\nprint(\"Calculating the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\\n\")\n\n# Partition 4\ncount_p4 = irreducible_counts[4]\ntotal_groups += count_p4\nprint(f\"Partition 4 (irreducible groups):\")\nprint(f\"There are {count_p4} irreducible groups of rank 4.\")\nprint(f\"Subtotal = {total_groups}\\n\")\n\n# Partition 3 + 1\n# This is a product of one rank-3 group and one rank-1 group.\ncount_p3_1 = irreducible_counts[3] * irreducible_counts[1]\ntotal_groups += count_p3_1\nprint(f\"Partition 3 + 1:\")\nprint(f\"Number of groups = (choices for rank 3) * (choices for rank 1)\")\nprint(f\"                 = {irreducible_counts[3]} * {irreducible_counts[1]} = {count_p3_1}\")\nprint(f\"Subtotal = {total_groups}\\n\")\n\n# Partition 2 + 2\n# This is a product of two rank-2 groups.
