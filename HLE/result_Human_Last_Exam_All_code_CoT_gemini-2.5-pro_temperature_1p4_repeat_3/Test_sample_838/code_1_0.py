    # Step 1
    print("--- Step 1: Elimination Reaction ---")
    print("1. Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, which is systematically named (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane.")
    print("2. Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically bulky base.")
    print("3. Reaction: The reaction of a secondary alkyl halide with a bulky base favors an E2 elimination.")
    print("4. Regioselectivity: The bulky base removes a proton from the least sterically hindered position, which is the terminal methyl group (C4). This is known as Hofmann's rule and it produces the less substituted alkene.")
    print("5. Product A: The product is 4-phenylbut-1-ene. The double bond is formed between carbons 1 and 2 of the 'but-1-ene' portion. The original chiral center at carbon 3 is destroyed.")
    print("   Equation: C6H5-CH2-CH2-CH(Br)-CH3  -->  C6H5-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2\n")

    # Step 2
    print("--- Step 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation ---")
    print("1. Starting Material: Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene).")
    print("2. Reagents: Borane in THF (BH3/THF) followed by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).")
    print("3. Reaction: This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which effectively adds water (H-OH) across a double bond.")
    print("4. Regioselectivity: The reaction follows anti-Markovnikov selectivity. The hydroxyl group (-OH) adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond (carbon 1 of the butene chain, which becomes carbon 4 of the final butanol chain).")
    print("5. Product B: The resulting product is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol. This molecule is achiral.")
    print("   Equation: C6H5-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2  -->  C6H5-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2OH\n")

    # Step 3
    print("--- Step 3: Bromination ---")
    print("1. Starting Material: Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol).")
    print("2. Reagent: Phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).")
    print("3. Reaction: PBr3 is a classic reagent used to convert primary alcohols into primary alkyl bromides via an SN2 substitution mechanism.")
    print("4. Product C: The hydroxyl group on carbon 1 of the butanol chain is replaced by a bromine atom.")
    print("   Equation: C6H5-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2OH  -->  C6H5-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Br\n")

    # Final Product Identity
    print("--- Final Product C: Identity and Chirality ---")
    print("The final product, C, is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.")
    print("Chirality Explanation: The final molecule, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is achiral. It does not contain any stereocenters (i.e., a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). The original chirality of the starting material, (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane, was lost in the first elimination step. The subsequent reactions did not create any new chiral centers.")
