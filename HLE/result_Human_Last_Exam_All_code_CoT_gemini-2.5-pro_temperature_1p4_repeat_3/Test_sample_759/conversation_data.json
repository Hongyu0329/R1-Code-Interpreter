    "Answering this question requires us to find the smallest simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ for which the size of its automorphism group, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|$, is exactly 3.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the condition**: An automorphism group of order 3 implies the existence of an automorphism $\\phi$ of order 3. Such a permutation $\\phi$ on the graph's vertices must be composed of one or more disjoint 3-cycles.\n2.  **Search for a minimal graph**: We will start by considering graphs with a small number of vertices ($n$) and edges ($e$).\n    *   An automorphism of order 3 requires the number of vertices to be at least 3.\n    *   We can show that no such graph exists for $n < 6$. For $n=3, 4, 5$, all possible connected graphs have automorphism groups with orders other than 3 (e.g., for $n=3$, the path $P_3$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=2$ and the triangle $K_3$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$).\n    *   Let's consider $n=6$. The order-3 automorphism must have the cycle structure $(v_1 v_2 v_3)(v_4 v_5 v_6)$. This partitions the vertices into two orbits of size 3. The sum of degrees in the graph is $2e$. Since all vertices in an orbit must have the same degree, we have $2e = 3 \\times (\\text{degree of orbit 1}) + 3 \\times (\\text{degree of orbit 2})$. This implies that $2e$ must be a multiple of 3, and therefore, $e$ must be a multiple of 3.\n3.  **Test small edge counts for n=6**:\n    *   $e=3$: A connected graph with 6 vertices needs at least $n-1=5$ edges. So $e=3$ is not possible.\n    *   $e=6$: We can construct candidate graphs, but they all turn out to have larger automorphism groups (e.g., of order 6 or 12).\n    *   $e=9$: This is the next possibility. We can construct a graph with 9 edges that is \"chiral\" (lacks reflectional symmetry) but has 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n4.  **Construct and Verify**: We will construct this graph with $n=6$ and $e=9$. The python code below will define this graph, verify its properties, and demonstrate programmatically that it has the desired rotational symmetry but lacks a specific reflectional symmetry, which supports the conclusion that its automorphism group is of size 3.\n\nThe constructed graph has two sets of vertices, $\\{u_0, u_1, u_2\\}$ and $\\{v_0, v_1, v_2\\}$.\n*   The vertices $\\{u_0, u_1, u_2\\}$ form a triangle.\n*   The vertices $\\{v_0, v_1, v_2\\}$ are independent (no edges between them).\n*   Each vertex $u_i$ is connected to $v_i$ and $v_{i+1 \\pmod 3}$. This \"twisted\" connection breaks the reflectional symmetries.\n\nThis construction results in a graph with 9 edges. Based on the reasoning that smaller values of `e` are not possible, this will be our answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef check_graph_properties(edges, num_vertices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a graph is connected.\n    \n    Args:\n        edges (list of tuples): The list of edges in the graph.\n        num_vertices (int): The total number of vertices.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the graph is connected, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not edges and num_vertices > 1:\n        return False\n        \n    adj = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    for u, v in edges:\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    q = collections.deque([0])\n    visited = {0}\n    \n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if v not in visited:\n                visited.add(v)\n                q.append(v)\n                \n    return len(visited) == num_vertices\n\ndef is_automorphism(edges, perm_map):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given permutation of vertices is an automorphism of the graph.\n    \n    An automorphism preserves adjacency.
