    "The user is asking for the title of an Oscar-nominated film based on a specific scene. I will identify the movie and then use a Python script with a `print` statement to display the answer, as requested.\n\n1.  **Analyze the query:** The key elements are:\n    *   Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   A character says \"Thank you.\"\n    *   This happens while boarding a bus (or in a related context).\n    *   This action \"seals his fate.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the film:** This specific clue points to the 1995 film *The Usual Suspects*. In the film, the character Verbal Kint (who is actually the master criminal Keyser Söze) concludes his elaborate, fabricated story to U.S. Customs Agent Dave Kujan. After being released, he says \"Thank you\" to one of the officers. Agent Kujan later has a moment of realization when he hears a fax coming through describing Keyser Söze and simultaneously notices that all the details from Kint's story were taken from items on the office bulletin board. Kint's successful deception is sealed, and he escapes.\n\n3.  **Verify Oscar nomination:** *The Usual Suspects* was nominated for and won two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor for Kevin Spacey and Best Original Screenplay for Christopher McQuarrie.\n\n4.  **Plan the code:** I will write a simple Python script that prints the name of the movie.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the film that matches the description.\nmovie_title = \"The Usual Suspects\"\nprint(f\"The film is: {movie_title}\")\n```\n<<<'The Usual Suspects'>>>"
