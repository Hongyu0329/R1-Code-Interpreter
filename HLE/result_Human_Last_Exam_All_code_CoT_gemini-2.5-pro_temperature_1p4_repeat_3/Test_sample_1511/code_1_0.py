    # Part (a): Can F and G contain multisets with disjoint supports?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # Let F be a multiset in the family F and G be a multiset in the family G.
    # The condition for the families to be cross 1-intersecting is |F \u2229 G| >= 1.
    # The support of a multiset S, denoted supp(S), is the set of distinct elements in S.
    # If supp(F) and supp(G) are disjoint, it means they share no common elements.
    # The multiset intersection F \u2229 G is defined by taking the minimum multiplicity of each element.
    # If the supports are disjoint, this minimum multiplicity is 0 for all elements.
    # Therefore, the multiset intersection F \u2229 G is the empty set, and its size is |F \u2229 G| = 0.
    # This contradicts the cross 1-intersecting condition.
    # Thus, it is not possible for any F in F and G in G to have disjoint supports.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): If k=2 and m=5, what is |F| + |G|?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # For non-empty cross 1-intersecting families F and G, a variant of the Erd\u0151s-Ko-Rado theorem
    # states that the sum |F| + |G| is maximized when F = G = F_i, where F_i is the family of
    # all k-multisets from [m] that contain a fixed element i.
    # The size of F_i can be calculated as C(m+k-2, k-1).
    m, k = 5, 2
    size_Fi = math.comb(m + k - 2, k - 1)
    # The maximal sum is |F_i| + |F_i|.
    max_sum = size_Fi + size_Fi

    # The prompt requires showing the equation.

    # Part (c): Must F necessarily contain all k-multisets that include a fixed element?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # This questions the uniqueness of the extremal structure. We test a small case.
    # Let k=2, m=3. The condition m >= k+1 holds (3 >= 3).
    # The standard maximal family is F = G = F_1 = {{1,1}, {1,2}, {1,3}}.
    # The sum is |F| + |G| = 3 + 3 = 6. F contains all 2-multisets with element 1.
    #
    # Consider an alternative family: F' = {{1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}}.
    # Let G' = F'. This is a cross-intersecting pair.
    # |F'| + |G'| = 3 + 3 = 6, which is also maximal.
    # However, F' is not of the form F_i. For instance, it doesn't contain {1,1}, so it's not
    # the family of all multisets containing 1.
    # This counterexample shows that maximality can be achieved by other structures.
