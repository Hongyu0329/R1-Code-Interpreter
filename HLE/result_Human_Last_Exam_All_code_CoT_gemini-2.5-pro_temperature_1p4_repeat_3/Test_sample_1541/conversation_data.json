  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters \"+\". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. String s is at most 1000 characters long.\n\nOutput\nPrint the new sum that Xenia can count.\n\nTask:\n\nWrite the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem. Answer m as the total memory in bytes used for variables of this problem. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here is my plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\nMy plan to solve this is to rearrange the numbers in the given sum into non-decreasing order.\n\n1.  First, I will read the input string, which looks like \"3+2+1+4\".\n2.  Next, I will remove the \"+\" signs to get a list of the numbers.\n3.  Then, I will sort this list of numbers.\n4.  Finally, I will combine the sorted numbers back into a string, separated by \"+\" signs, and print the result. This will be the sum that Xenia can easily calculate.\n\nFor the second part of your request, to find the memory usage 'm' of the most memory-efficient C program, I will analyze a C program that uses a more optimal strategy. Instead of storing the entire input string, it can process it character by character.\n\n1.  This C program would use an array of 4 integers to count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4' without storing the numbers themselves.\n2.  It would read the input one character at a time. If the character is a digit, it would increment the corresponding counter. It would also count the total number of summands to handle the '+' signs correctly.\n3.  After counting, it would print the final sorted sum by iterating through its counts, printing the required number of '1's, then '2's, and so on, joined by '+'.\n\nHere is the calculation for the memory used by the variables in such a C program (assuming `int` is 4 bytes and `char` is 1 byte):\n*   `int counts[4]`: An array to store the counts of the four numbers. Memory: `4 * sizeof(int) = 4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n*   `int total_numbers`: A counter for the total summands. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n*   `char c`: A variable to hold one character from the input at a time. Memory: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n*   `int numbers_printed`: A helper counter for printing '+' correctly. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n*   Loop variables (`i`, `j`): Two integers for the loops. Memory: `2 * sizeof(int) = 2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n\nThe total memory `m` for variables would be the sum of these: 16 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 33 bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the rearrangement logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Read the sum from the input line.\n# Example input: \"3+2+1+4\"\ninput_sum = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# The numbers are separated by '+'. We can split the string by '+'\n# to get a list of the number strings.\n# Example: ['3', '2', '1', '4']\nnumbers = input_sum.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers. Since they are single digits,\n# a standard string sort will correctly order them non-decreasingly.\n# Example: ['1', '2', '3', '4']\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted list of numbers back into a single string,\n# with '+' as the separator between them.\n# Example: \"1+2+3+4\"\nsorted_sum = '+'.join(numbers)\n\n# Print the final rearranged sum. Each number and the '+' signs\n# are part of the final equation string.\nprint(sorted_sum)\n```\n<<<33>>>"
