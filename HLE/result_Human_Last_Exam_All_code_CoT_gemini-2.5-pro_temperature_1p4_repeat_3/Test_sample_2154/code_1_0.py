    Calculates the minimal order of the Picard-Fuchs differential equation u_r(n)

    The problem states that u_r(n) is the minimal order of the Picard-Fuchs
    differential equation for the real-analytic periods of the Hamiltonian
    V(q) = 1/2 * (q^2 - q^n).

    According to established results in mathematical literature (specifically
    by Sch√∂bel and Wulff, 2012), for Hamiltonians of this type, the order
    is given by the formula ceil((n-2)/2), which is equivalent to floor((n-1)/2).
