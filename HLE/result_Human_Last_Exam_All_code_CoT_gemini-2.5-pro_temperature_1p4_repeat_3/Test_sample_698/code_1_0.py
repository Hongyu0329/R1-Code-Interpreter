# Define the problem components
description = "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

# Analyze the syllable pattern of the base word and the answer

# Print the step-by-step reasoning

print("Step 2: Analyze the structure of the correct answer.")
print(f"The chosen sentence is: '{answer_choice_b}'")
print(f"The base word '{base_word}' sets the syllable pattern: {base_word_syllables[0]}-{base_word_syllables[1]}-{base_word_syllables[2]}")
print(f"The punny phrase 'Come poo, tern!' repeats this pattern phonetically: {pun_syllables[0]}-{pun_syllables[1]}-{pun_syllables[2]}")
print("\nDemonstrating the syllable repetition (as per the avalanche definition):")
print(f"  - First syllable:  '{base_word_syllables[0]}' is repeated as '{pun_syllables[0]}'")
print(f"  - Second syllable: '{base_word_syllables[1]}' is repeated as '{pun_syllables[1]}'")
print(f"  - Third syllable:  '{base_word_syllables[2]}' is repeated as '{pun_syllables[2]}'")
print("-" * 40)

print("Step 3: Verify the thematic match.")
print("The phrase 'Come poo, tern!' is a command from the 'Computer' (the software) to a 'tern' (a bird) telling it when and where to 'poo' (relieve itself).")
print("This perfectly matches the description.")
print("-" * 40)

print("Conclusion: Choice B is the correct answer because it satisfies both the structural rules of a True Avalanche and the thematic requirements of the description.")
