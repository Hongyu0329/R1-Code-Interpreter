    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of higher-dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$ on the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that do not simplicially collapse onto their root set $R$. This number can be determined using a result from combinatorial algebraic topology known as the Forest Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **State the relevant theorem:** The number of non-collapsing rooted forests on a simplicial complex $K$ is a topological invariant. The Forest Theorem, developed by Jakob Jonsson and others, states that this number is equal to the product of the orders of the torsion subgroups of the reduced integral homology groups of the complex.\n2.  **Identify the simplicial complex:** The problem specifies the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". Let's call this complex $K$. Since homology is a topological invariant, any valid triangulation of the Möbius band will yield the same result. The dimension of this complex is 2.\n3.  **Apply the Forest Theorem formula:** For a $d-1$ dimensional complex $K$, the number of non-collapsing rooted forests is given by the formula:\n    $N = \\prod_{i=0}^{d-2} |Tors(\\tilde{H}_i(K, \\mathbb{Z}))|$\n    For our 2-dimensional complex $K$, we have $d-1=2$, so $d=3$. The product runs from $i=0$ to $d-2=1$.\n    $N = |Tors(\\tilde{H}_0(K, \\mathbb{Z}))| \\times |Tors(\\tilde{H}_1(K, \\mathbb{Z}))|$\n4.  **Compute the homology groups of the Möbius band:**\n    *   The Möbius band is path-connected, so its 0-th homology group $H_0(K, \\mathbb{Z})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$. The reduced 0-th homology $\\tilde{H}_0(K, \\mathbb{Z})$ is therefore the trivial group, $\\{0\\}$.\n    *   The Möbius band deformation retracts onto its core, which is a circle ($S^1$). Therefore, they have the same homology groups. The first homology group of a circle is $H_1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $H_1(K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since the complex is connected, this is also the reduced homology group, $\\tilde{H}_1(K, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n5.  **Find the orders of the torsion subgroups:**\n    *   For $\\tilde{H}_0(K, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\{0\\}$, the torsion subgroup is $\\{0\\}$ itself. The order of this group is 1.\n    *   For $\\tilde{H}_1(K, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, the torsion subgroup consists of elements of finite order. In the group of integers, only 0 has finite order. So, the torsion subgroup is $\\{0\\}$. The order of this group is also 1.\n6.  **Calculate the final number:** Multiply the orders of the torsion subgroups to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements the final step of this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Determine the orders of the torsion subgroups of the reduced homology groups.\n\n# The simplicial complex K is a triangulation of the Möbius band.\n# It is 2-dimensional.\n# The number of non-collapsing forests is given by the product of the orders of\n# the torsion subgroups of its reduced integral homology groups, from H_0 to H_{dim-1}.\n\n# For the 0-th reduced homology group, H_0(K), K is path-connected, so H_0(K) is the trivial group {0}.\n# The torsion subgroup of {0} is {0}, which has order 1.\norder_tors_h0 = 1\n\n# For the 1st reduced homology group, H_1(K), the Möbius band deformation retracts\n# to a circle, so H_1(K) is isomorphic to the integers, Z.\n# The torsion subgroup of Z is {0}, which has order 1.\norder_tors_h1 = 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number by multiplying these orders.\n# The formula is N = |Tors(H_0(K))| * |Tors(H_1(K))|\ntotal_non_collapsing_forests = order_tors_h0 * order_tors_h1\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(\"The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is the product of the orders of the torsion subgroups of its homology groups.\")\nprint(f\"Order of Torsion(H_0): {order_tors_h0}\")\nprint(f\"Order of Torsion(H_1): {order_tors_h1}\")\nprint(\"Final Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{order_tors_h0} * {order_tors_h1} = {total_non_collapsing_forests}\")\n```\n<<<1>>>"
