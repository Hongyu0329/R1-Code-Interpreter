# Step 1: Determine the orders of the torsion subgroups of the reduced homology groups.

# The simplicial complex K is a triangulation of the Möbius band.
# It is 2-dimensional.
# The number of non-collapsing forests is given by the product of the orders of
# the torsion subgroups of its reduced integral homology groups, from H_0 to H_{dim-1}.

# For the 0-th reduced homology group, H_0(K), K is path-connected, so H_0(K) is the trivial group {0}.
# The torsion subgroup of {0} is {0}, which has order 1.
order_tors_h0 = 1

# For the 1st reduced homology group, H_1(K), the Möbius band deformation retracts
# to a circle, so H_1(K) is isomorphic to the integers, Z.
# The torsion subgroup of Z is {0}, which has order 1.
order_tors_h1 = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the total number by multiplying these orders.
# The formula is N = |Tors(H_0(K))| * |Tors(H_1(K))|
total_non_collapsing_forests = order_tors_h0 * order_tors_h1

# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.
