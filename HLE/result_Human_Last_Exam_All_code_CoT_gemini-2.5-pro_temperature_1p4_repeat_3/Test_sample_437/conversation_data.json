    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan and the Python code to evaluate the integral.\n\n### Plan\n\nI will evaluate the quantum mechanical integral $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$, which represents the expectation value of the electron-nucleus potential energy for an electron in a 1s Slater-type orbital (STO). For this case, the bra $\\langle \\phi_i |$ and the ket $| \\phi_j \\rangle$ are the same 1s orbital, so we write $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi_{1s}$.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish the mathematical expression for a normalized 1s Slater orbital, which depends on a parameter $\\zeta$ called the orbital exponent. The formula is $\\phi_{1s}(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r}$.\n2.  Next, I will set up the three-dimensional integral over all space in spherical coordinates: $\\int \\phi_{1s}^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$.\n3.  The integral conveniently separates into an angular part and a radial part, which I will evaluate.\n4.  I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform these integrations rigorously. The script will derive the general result in terms of $\\zeta$.\n5.  The script will display the breakdown of the calculation, including the values for the normalization constant, the angular integral, and the radial integral, to show how they combine into the final result.\n6.  Finally, to provide a specific numerical answer, I will consider the case of a hydrogen atom, where it is standard to set the orbital exponent $\\zeta=1$.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater orbital\n    and prints the step-by-step derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols\n    # zeta is the orbital exponent, a positive real number.\n    # r is the radial distance, a positive real number.\n    zeta = sp.Symbol('zeta', positive=True)\n    r = sp.Symbol('r', positive=True)\n    theta, phi = sp.symbols('theta phi')\n\n    print(\"Evaluating the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater orbital.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # 1.
