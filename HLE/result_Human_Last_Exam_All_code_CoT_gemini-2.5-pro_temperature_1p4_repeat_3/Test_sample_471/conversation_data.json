    "To determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we can use Morse theory, which connects the topology of a manifold to the critical points of functions defined on it.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Manifold and its Topological Invariants:** The manifold is the 2-torus, $T^2$. Its topology is characterized by its Betti numbers, which count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions.\n    *   $b_0$: number of connected components.\n    *   $b_1$: number of 1-dimensional \"circular\" holes.\n    *   $b_2$: number of 2-dimensional \"voids\".\n    For the 2-torus $T^2$, these are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$.\n\n2.  **Use the Morse Inequalities:** For a special class of \"nice\" functions called Morse functions, the number of critical points of each type (index) is related to the Betti numbers by the Morse inequalities. Let $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$.\n    *   Index 0 corresponds to a local minimum.\n    *   Index 1 corresponds to a saddle point.\n    *   Index 2 corresponds to a local maximum.\n\n    The Morse inequalities state:\n    *   $c_0 \\ge b_0$\n    *   $c_1 - c_0 \\ge b_1 - b_0$\n    *   $c_2 - c_1 + c_0 = b_2 - b_1 + b_0$ (This last one is always an equality, representing the Euler characteristic).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimum Number of Critical Points:** We can use these inequalities to find the minimum required number of each type of critical point.\n    *   From $c_0 \\ge b_0$, we need at least $c_0 \\ge 1$ minimum. Let's assume the minimum possible, $c_0 = 1$.\n    *   A function on a compact space like a torus must have a maximum, which is a critical point of index 2. So we must have at least one maximum, $c_2 \\ge 1$. This also follows from the first Morse inequality applied to the function $-f$, which gives $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$. Let's assume the minimum possible, $c_2=1$.\n    *   Now, we use the second inequality to find the minimum number of saddle points ($c_1$):\n        $c_1 \\ge (b_1 - b_0) + c_0$\n        $c_1 \\ge (2 - 1) + 1 = 2$.\n        So, we need at least 2 saddle points.\n\n4.  **Sum the Results:** The minimal total number of critical points for a Morse function is the sum of the minimums for each type:\n    Minimal total = (min $c_0$) + (min $c_1$) + (min $c_2$) = $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\nWhile this derivation is for Morse functions, it can be shown that this lower bound holds for any smooth function on the torus. It is also possible to construct a function on the torus with exactly 4 critical points (one minimum, one maximum, and two saddles), confirming that 4 is indeed the minimum.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal number based on the Betti numbers of the torus.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse inequalities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2)\n    # b0: number of connected components\n    # b1: number of 1-dimensional holes\n    # b2: number of 2-dimensional holes\n    b0 = 1\n    b1 = 2\n    b2 = 1\n\n    print(f\"The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are:\")\n    print(f\"b0 = {b0}\")\n    print(f\"b1 = {b1}\")\n    print(f\"b2 = {b2}\\n\")\n\n    # According to Morse theory, any compact manifold must have at least one\n    # minimum and one maximum. For a Morse function, the number of critical points\n    # of index k (c_k) is bounded by the Betti numbers (b_k).\n\n    # Minimal number of minima (index 0)\n    # c0 >= b0\n    c0_min = b0\n\n    # Minimal number of maxima (index 2)\n    # This is equivalent to minima for the function -f.\n    # c2 >= b2\n    c2_min = b2\n\n    # Minimal number of saddle points (index 1) from the second Morse inequality:\n    # c1 - c0 >= b1 - b0  =>  c1 >= (b1 - b0) + c0\n    # To find the absolute minimum c1, we use the minimum c0.\n    c1_min = (b1 - b0) + c0_min\n    \n    print(\"From the Morse inequalities, we can derive the minimum number of critical points of each type:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal minima (c0) >= b0 = {c0_min}\")\n    print(f\"Minimal maxima (c2) >= b2 = {c2_min}\")\n    print(f\"Minimal saddles (c1) >= (b1 - b0) + c0 = ({b1} - {b0}) + {c0_min} = {c1_min}\\n\")\n\n    # The minimal total number of critical points is the sum of these minimums.\n    total_min = c0_min + c1_min + c2_min\n\n    print(\"The minimal total number of critical points is the sum of these minimums:\")\n    print(f\"{c0_min} (minima) + {c1_min} (saddles) + {c2_min} (maxima) = {total_min}\")\n\nsolve_minimal_critical_points()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
