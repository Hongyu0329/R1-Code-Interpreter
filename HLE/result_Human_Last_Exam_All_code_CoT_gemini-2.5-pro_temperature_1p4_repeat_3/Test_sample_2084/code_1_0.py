def get_product_smiles():
    """
    This function returns the SMILES string for the deduced hydrolysis product.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The provided SMILES string for the reactant is invalid but suggests a spiroketal structure.
    2. The reaction is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which opens the spiroketal rings.
    3. The product is a dihydroxy-ketone, which has a higher molar mass due to the addition of a water molecule.
    4. Based on the fragments suggested by the original SMILES (phenyl group, methyl group) and chemical stability principles (favoring the formation of stable 5-membered rings), the most plausible product structure is 1,5-dihydroxy-2-methyl-4-phenyl-3-pentanone.
