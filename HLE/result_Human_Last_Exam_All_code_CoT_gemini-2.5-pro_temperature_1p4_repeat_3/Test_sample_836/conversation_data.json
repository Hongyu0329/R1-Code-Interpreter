    "The quantity you are asking about is fundamental in the field of nuclear reactor noise analysis. The generalized pair correlation function, `G(r, t)`, describes the correlation in neutron detections separated by a vector `r` in space and an interval `t` in time.\n\nThe double Fourier transform of this function, with respect to both space and time, converts the function from the `(r, t)` domain to the `(k, ω)` domain, where `k` is the wavenumber and `ω` is the angular frequency.\n\nThis resulting function is most commonly called the **Power Spectral Density** (PSD) of the neutron noise, often denoted as `S(k, ω)`. It describes the variance (or \"power\") of the neutron population fluctuations as a function of spatial and temporal frequency.\n\nI will provide a Python script to display the common name for this quantity and its mathematical formula as derived from one-group neutron diffusion theory. This theory provides a simplified yet insightful model of neutron behavior in a reactor. The code will symbolically construct and print the equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script answers a conceptual question from nuclear reactor physics\n# by displaying the name and formula for a specific quantity.\n\ndef display_power_spectral_density_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and prints the name and symbolic formula for the\n    Power Spectral Density (PSD) of neutron noise based on one-group\n    diffusion theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables as strings for building the formula\n    S_kw = \"S(k, ω)\"  # The Power Spectral Density\n    C = \"C\"           # A constant representing the noise source strength\n    D = \"D\"           # Neutron diffusion coefficient\n    k_sq = \"k^2\"      # Wavenumber squared\n    Sigma_a = \"Σa\"    # Macroscopic absorption cross section\n    nu = \"ν\"          # Average neutrons per fission\n    Sigma_f = \"Σf\"    # Macroscopic fission cross section\n    i = \"i\"           # Imaginary unit\n    omega = \"ω\"       # Angular frequency\n    v = \"v\"           # Neutron speed\n\n    # The formula for the PSD is proportional to the squared modulus of the\n    # reactor transfer function.
