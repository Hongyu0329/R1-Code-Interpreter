    # Part (a): Analysis of symmetry.
    # The term "symmetric" is interpreted as being an element of the center Z(R).
    # The given conditions are not sufficient to prove that x^j * r is central for j >= 2.
    # A counterexample can be constructed using matrix algebras where an element w can be
    # non-central while w^2 is central (e.g., a nilpotent matrix). The action of g can
    # be chosen such that the overall expression for x^j * r is not a scalar matrix.
    # Therefore, the implication is false.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): Calculation for q = -1.
    # We evaluate the formula for j=2, a, r=1_R, and q=-1. Let w = x * 1_R.
    # The q-binomial coefficient C(2, 1, q^-1) for q^-1 = -1 is 0, which makes the k=1 term disappear.
    # The k=0 term is: (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 * C(2,0,-1) * w^2 * (g^0 a . 1_R) = w^2(a . 1_R).
    # The k=2 term is: (-1)^2 * (-1)^(-2*(1)/2) * C(2,2,-1) * (g^2 a . 1_R) * w^2 = -(g^2 a . 1_R)w^2.
    # Summing these gives the final expression.

    # Part (c): Expression for x^3 a * 1_R.
    # We evaluate the formula for j=3, a, r=1_R.
    # Given w = x * 1_R is in Z(R), w commutes with all elements.
    # The term w^(3-k) * (g^k a . 1_R) * w^k simplifies to w^3 * (g^k a . 1_R).
    # We can factor w^3 out of the sum.
    # The expression is w^3 multiplied by the sum of C_k * (g^k a . 1_R), where C_k are the coefficients.
    # C_0 = 1
    # C_1 = -(1+q^{-1}+q^{-2})
    # C_2 = q^{-1}(1+q^{-1}+q^{-2})
