    "To find the value of a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n, I will follow these steps.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the specific mathematical sequence for `a(n)`. The term \"number of Feynman diagrams\" can be ambiguous, as the count depends on the specific physical process (e.g., for an electron or a photon) and the class of diagrams being counted. However, in the context of a well-defined computational problem, this often refers to a known combinatorial sequence that can be generated with a straightforward recurrence relation.\n\nThe most appropriate sequence, listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS A000031) as the \"number of Feynman diagrams of order 2n in quantum electrodynamics\", is defined by the following recurrence relation:\n`a(n) = a(n-1) + (n-1) * a(n-2)`\n\nThe initial values for this sequence are `a(0) = 1` and `a(1) = 1`.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that implements this recurrence to calculate `a(3)`. The script will compute the necessary terms of the sequence (`a(0)`, `a(1)`, `a(2)`) and then use them to find `a(3)`. As requested, the final output will display the full calculation for `a(3)`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_sequence(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n,\n    using the recurrence a(n) = a(n-1) + (n-1)*a(n-2).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(target_n, int) or target_n < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the sequence values, starting with a(0) and a(1)\n    # a[i] will store the value of a(i)\n    a = [0] * (target_n + 1)\n    if target_n >= 0:\n        a[0] = 1\n    if target_n >= 1:\n        a[1] = 1\n\n    # Iteratively compute the sequence up to the target number\n    for i in range(2, target_n + 1):\n        a[i] = a[i-1] + (i-1) * a[i-2]\n\n    # If the target is a(3), display the specific calculation as requested\n    if target_n == 3:\n        val_a2 = a[2]\n        val_a1 = a[1]\n        val_a3 = a[3]\n        \n        print(f\"To find a(3), we use the recurrence relation a(n) = a(n-1) + (n-1)*a(n-2).\")\n        print(f\"For n=3, the formula is: a(3) = a(2) + (3-1)*a(3-2) = a(2) + 2*a(1).\")\n        print(f\"We have previously calculated a(1) = {val_a1} and a(2) = {val_a2}.\")\n        print(f\"Substituting these values into the equation for a(3):\")\n        # Output each number in the final equation\n        print(f\"{val_a2} + 2 * {val_a1} = {val_a3}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The value of a({target_n}) is: {a[target_n]}\")\n\n# The user asks for a(3)\nsolve_feynman_sequence(3)\n```\n<<<4>>>"
