# Based on the analysis, we have three cases for solutions for n.
# We find the smallest candidate for n from each case and then take the minimum.

# Case A: n is coprime to 10.
# The smallest n must be of the form 1 + k * 10^9, with k not a multiple of 10.
# The smallest positive k is 1.
n_A = 10**9 + 1

# Case B: n is even, not a multiple of 5.
# n = 1 + k * 5^9, with k odd and not a multiple of 5.
# The smallest positive k is 1.
n_B = 1 * (5**9) + 1

# Case C: n is odd, is a multiple of 5.
# n = 1 + k * 2^9, with k odd and k = 2 (mod 5).
# The smallest positive k is 7.
p2_9 = 2**9
n_C = 7 * p2_9 + 1

# The result is the minimum of the candidates.
result = min(n_A, n_B, n_C)

# The final equation is the one that produces the minimum value.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is n = 7 * 2^9 + 1, which equals 3585.
# The numbers are 7, 2, 9, 1 and the result 3585.
