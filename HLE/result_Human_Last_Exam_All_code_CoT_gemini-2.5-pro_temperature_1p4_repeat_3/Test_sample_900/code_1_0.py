# The task is to count the number of "pas de Balanchine" steps in Svetlana Gileva's
# performance of the Jete Woman solo from Forsythe's "In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated".

# Based on choreographic analysis, while the style is Balanchine-esque,
# the piece does not contain the specific, countable step named "pas de Balanchine".
# The solo's vocabulary is built around other movements like piqués and jetés.
pas_de_balanchine_count = 0

# The final equation is the assignment of this value.
# We will now print the result in a full sentence.
print(f"The total number of pas de Balanchines performed is {pas_de_balanchine_count}.")
