    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will analyze the induced map on rational homotopy groups, $f_* \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Connectivity:** The connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups $\\pi_i(f): \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\n2.  **Rational Homotopy:** We will compute the dimensions in which the rational homotopy groups $\\pi_i(-) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ of the source and target spaces are non-zero. This provides strong constraints on the connectivity of the integral map.\n3.  **Source Space Analysis:** The source space is $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. We'll find the dimensions where $\\pi_i(A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is non-zero.\n    *   The rational homotopy groups of an even-dimensional sphere $S^n$ are non-zero only in dimensions $n$ and $2n-1$.\n    *   The rational homotopy groups of a loop space $\\Omega X$ are given by $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   Using this, we find the rational homotopy of $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$.\n    *   Then, we use the KÃ¼nneth formula for rational homotopy of a smash product.\n    *   Finally, we use the fact that $\\pi_i(\\Sigma X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\pi_{i-1}(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n4.  **Target Space Analysis:** The target space is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. We'll find the dimensions where $\\pi_i(B) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is non-zero.\n    *   Rationally, the smash product of spheres $S^m \\wedge S^n$ is equivalent to a single sphere $S^{m+n}$. So, $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq_{\\mathbb{Q}} S^{10}$.\n    *   We then find the rational homotopy of $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n5.  **Determine Connectivity:** By comparing the rational homotopy groups of the source and target, we find the first dimension where the map is not an isomorphism. This allows us to determine the connectivity.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the connectivity.\n\n```python\ndef get_rational_homotopy_dims_sphere(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns dimensions of non-zero rational homotopy for S^n.\"\"\"\n    if n % 2 == 1: # Odd sphere\n        return [n]\n    else: # Even sphere\n        if n == 0: return []\n        return [n, 2 * n - 1]\n\ndef get_rational_homotopy_dims_loop_space_of_sphere(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns dimensions of non-zero rational homotopy for Omega(S^n).\"\"\"\n    sphere_dims = get_rational_homotopy_dims_sphere(n)\n    return [d - 1 for d in sphere_dims]\n\ndef get_rational_homotopy_dims_smash_product(dims1, dims2):\n    \"\"\"Returns dimensions for the smash product given dims for two spaces.\"\"\"\n    smash_dims = []\n    for d1 in dims1:\n        for d2 in dims2:\n            smash_dims.append(d1 + d2)\n    return sorted(list(set(smash_dims)))\n\ndef get_rational_homotopy_dims_suspension(dims):\n    \"\"\"Returns dimensions for the suspension of a space.\"\"\"\n    return [d + 1 for d in dims]\n\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the connectivity of the map.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation of the connectivity:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Source Space Analysis ---\n    print(\"1.
