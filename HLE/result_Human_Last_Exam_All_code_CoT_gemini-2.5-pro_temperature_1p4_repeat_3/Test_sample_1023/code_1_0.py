# Plan:
# 1. Define symbolic rates for speciation (λ_e), extinction (μ_e), and anagenetic splitting (σ).
# 2. Assume all rates are equal based on the problem's context (e.g., set to a base value of 1).
# 3. Calculate the total extinction rate for a morphospecies (μ_m) by summing the rates of all events that cause extinction.
# 4. Calculate the ratio of the morphospecies extinction rate to the evolutionary species extinction rate.

# Step 1: Define the fundamental rates.
# The problem states "all the processes that affect them occur at the same rates".
# This means the rate of true speciation (λ_e), true extinction (μ_e), and
# anagenetic splitting (σ) are equal. We can use a base rate 'r' of 1.0 for the calculation.
r = 1.0
lambda_e = r  # True speciation rate
mu_e = r     # True extinction rate
sigma = r    # Anagenetic splitting rate (causes pseudo-extinction)

# Step 2: Determine the total extinction rate for a morphospecies (μ_m).
# This rate is the sum of three distinct events that lead to the termination of a morphospecies:
# 1. True extinction of the entire lineage (rate: μ_e)
# 2. Pseudo-extinction from anagenesis (rate: σ)
# 3. Pseudo-extinction from bifurcating speciation (rate: 0.5 * λ_e)
