    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes (15*15*15 / 9*1*1 = 375) gives an upper limit but doesn't account for the physical constraints of packing.\n\nMy plan is to use a \"greedy\" packing strategy. I will calculate the number of blocks that can be placed in a single orientation, and then I'll calculate how many more blocks can be fit into the remaining empty space by changing their orientation. This process is repeated until no more blocks can fit. The Python code below will walk through these steps, showing the calculation for each layer of blocks and the resulting empty space, ultimately summing the blocks from each step to find the total.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    cube_edge = 15\n    block_l, block_w, block_h = 9, 1, 1\n\n    print(\"To find the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks in a 15x15x15 cube, we pack them in stages.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Stage 1 ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Fill the cube with blocks in the first orientation.\")\n    # Align the 9-unit side with an edge of the cube\n    n1_x = math.floor(cube_edge / block_l)\n    n1_y = math.floor(cube_edge / block_w)\n    n1_z = math.floor(cube_edge / block_h)\n    blocks_1 = n1_x * n1_y * n1_z\n    \n    print(f\"We align the 9-unit side of the blocks along one 15-unit edge.\")\n    print(f\"Number of blocks fitting: floor({cube_edge}/{block_l}) * floor({cube_edge}/{block_w}) * floor({cube_edge}/{block_h}) = {n1_x} * {n1_y} * {n1_z} = {blocks_1}\")\n    \n    # Calculate remaining space\n    rem_dim1 = cube_edge - (n1_x * block_l)\n    print(f\"This occupies a {n1_x * block_l}x{cube_edge}x{cube_edge} volume, leaving a {rem_dim1}x{cube_edge}x{cube_edge} space empty.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Stage 2 ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Fill the remaining space with a different orientation.\")\n    # The remaining space is 6x15x15.\n    space_dims_2 = [rem_dim1, cube_edge, cube_edge]\n    print(f\"Now we pack the {space_dims_2[0]}x{space_dims_2[1]}x{space_dims_2[2]} empty space.\")\n    print(\"We must orient the 9-unit side of the blocks along one of the 15-unit edges.\")\n    \n    n2_x = math.floor(space_dims_2[0] / block_w)\n    n2_y = math.floor(space_dims_2[1] / block_l)\n    n2_z = math.floor(space_dims_2[2] / block_h)\n    blocks_2 = n2_x * n2_y * n2_z\n    print(f\"Number of blocks fitting: floor({space_dims_2[0]}/{block_w}) * floor({space_dims_2[1]}/{block_l}) * floor({space_dims_2[2]}/{block_h}) = {n2_x} * {n2_y} * {n2_z} = {blocks_2}\")\n\n    # Calculate new remaining space\n    rem_dim2 = space_dims_2[1] - (n2_y * block_l)\n    print(f\"This leaves a new empty space of {space_dims_2[0]}x{rem_dim2}x{space_dims_2[2]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Stage 3 ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Fill the new remaining space.\")\n    # The remaining space is 6x6x15\n    space_dims_3 = [space_dims_2[0], rem_dim2, space_dims_2[2]]\n    print(f\"Now we pack the {space_dims_3[0]}x{space_dims_3[1]}x{space_dims_3[2]} empty space.\")\n    print(\"We orient the 9-unit side of the blocks along the final 15-unit edge.\")\n    \n    n3_x = math.floor(space_dims_3[0] / block_w)\n    n3_y = math.floor(space_dims_3[1] / block_h)\n    n3_z = math.floor(space_dims_3[2] / block_l)\n    blocks_3 = n3_x * n3_y * n3_z\n    print(f\"Number of blocks fitting: floor({space_dims_3[0]}/{block_w}) * floor({space_dims_3[1]}/{block_h}) * floor({space_dims_3[2]}/{block_l}) = {n3_x} * {n3_y} * {n3_z} = {blocks_3}\")\n\n    # Calculate final remaining space\n    rem_dim3 = space_dims_3[2] - (n3_z * block_l)\n    print(f\"The final remaining empty space is {space_dims_3[0]}x{space_dims_3[1]}x{rem_dim3}.\")\n    print(\"No more 9x1x1 blocks can fit into this 6x6x6 space.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Final Calculation ---\n    total_blocks = blocks_1 + blocks_2 + blocks_3\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(\"The total number of blocks is the sum from all steps:\")\n    print(f\"{blocks_1} + {blocks_2} + {blocks_3} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing_problem()\n```\n<<<351>>>"
