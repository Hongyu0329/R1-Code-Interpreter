    "This is a fun movie trivia question! The scene you're describing is one of the most iconic moments from a major 2000s teen comedy. Here is my plan to identify the film and present it as requested.\n\n1.  **Analyze the query:** The key elements are: a major Hollywood film, a teenager, a pink bike, and an oncoming car.\n2.  **Recall the scene:** This description strongly points to the movie *Mean Girls* (2004), produced by Paramount Pictures.\n3.  **Verify the details:** In the movie, the character Regina George (a teenager) is on a pink motor scooter (often remembered as a bike) and is struck by a school bus (often remembered as a car). Despite these minor differences in memory, the core visual is a perfect match and famously iconic.\n4.  **Construct the code:** I will create a simple Python script that assigns the movie title to a variable and then uses the `print()` function to display the answer.\n\n```python\n# Identify the movie based on the user's description.\n# The scene involves a teenager (Regina George) and a pink vehicle.\n# While the description mentions a \"pink bike\" and a \"car\", the actual movie scene\n# features a pink motor scooter and a school bus.\n# This iconic scene is from the film \"Mean Girls\".\n\nmovie_title = \"Mean Girls\"\nrelease_year = 2004\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"The Hollywood feature film with this scene is: {movie_title} ({release_year})\")\n```\n<<<Mean Girls>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
