    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will explain the fundamental principles of symmetry required for optical activity. A material can be optically active only if its crystal structure is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of crystallographic point groups (crystal classes), this means the class must not contain any improper rotation operations, which are mirror planes (m) and centers of inversion (Ä«).\n\nSecond, I will address the terms in your question. You are asking for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: This means the crystal class *does* contain a mirror plane or a center of inversion.\n2.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: As explained above, this requires the crystal class to be *chiral*.\n\nThese two conditions are mutually exclusive. A crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. Therefore, there are no achiral crystal classes that exhibit optical activity.\n\nTo demonstrate this formally using code, I will write a Python script. The script will:\n1.  Define the set of all 32 crystal classes.\n2.  Define the subset of these classes that are chiral (and thus, capable of optical activity).\n3.  Define the subset of classes that are achiral (all classes that are not chiral).\n4.  Find the intersection of the \"achiral\" set and the \"optically active\" set.\n5.  Print the logic and the result, which will be an empty set.\n\n```python\ndef find_optically_active_achiral_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal classes to find which are achiral, non-polar,\n    and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 11 chiral (and thus optically active) crystal classes.\n    # Optical activity is possible ONLY in these classes.\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes).\n    all_crystal_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-62m', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Achiral classes are all classes that are NOT chiral (optically active).\n    # They contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n    achiral_classes = all_crystal_classes - optically_active_classes\n\n    # The question asks for crystal classes that are BOTH achiral AND optically active.\n    # We find the intersection of these two sets.\n    result_set = achiral_classes.intersection(optically_active_classes)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the condition for optical activity.\")\n    print(\"A crystal class must be CHIRAL to be optically active.\")\n    print(\"The 11 chiral (optically active) classes are:\")\n    print(sorted(list(optically_active_classes)))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Define the condition for being achiral.\")\n    print(\"An achiral class is any class that is NOT chiral.\")\n    print(\"The 21 achiral classes are:\")\n    print(sorted(list(achiral_classes)))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the crystal classes that satisfy BOTH conditions.\")\n    print(\"We are looking for classes in the intersection of the 'achiral' set and the 'optically active' set.\")\n    print(f\"Intersection of Achiral and Optically Active sets: {list(result_set)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"There is a fundamental contradiction in the request.
