# The original differential equation appears to be a variation of a standard form.
# By assuming a likely intended version, the equation becomes factorable.
# The modified (and solved) equation is: y^2*(dy/dx)^2 + 6*x*y*(dy/dx) - (x^2)*(y^2) + 9*(x^2) = 0
# This factors into two separate first-order ODEs.

# The general solution is a family of curves described by two equations.
# We represent the arbitrary constants as C1 and C2.

# Equation 1 from the first factor:
print("The general solution is given by the union of two families of curves:")
print("Family 1: 2*y + 6*ln|y-3| = x**2 + C1")

# Equation 2 from the second factor:
print("Family 2: 2*y - 6*ln|y+3| = -x**2 + C2")
