def solve_agent_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the final answer based on the analytical derivation of the problem.

    The derivation involves these key stages:
    1.  A's winning condition for given r, F, D, θ: cos(θ) > (D^2 - F^2 + 2Fr) / (2Dr).
    2.  A's optimal move D for a given r and F: D = sqrt(F(2r-F)) for r >= F/2.
        - If r < F/2, A wins with probability 1.
    3.  The overall probability of A winning, P(F), is found by integrating over r from 0 to 1:
        P(F) = ∫[0, F/2] 1 dr + ∫[F/2, 1] (1/π) * arccos(sqrt(F(2r-F))/r) dr.
    4.  This integral evaluates to:
        P(F) = F/4 + 2F/π + (1/π) * [arccos(sqrt(2F-F^2)) - sqrt(F(2-F))].
    5.  Minimizing P(F) by setting its derivative dP/dF = 0 gives the condition:
        sqrt((2-F)/F) = π/4 + 2. Let K = π/4 + 2.
    6.  Solving for the minimized probability P_min at the optimal F gives the expression:
        P_min = (2/π) * arctan(K) - 1/2.
    """

    # The constant K is derived from optimizing the probability function P(F).
    K = math.pi / 4.0 + 2.0

    # The minimized probability of A winning, P_min.
    p_a_wins = (2.0 / math.pi) * math.atan(K) - 0.5

    # The final result as requested by the problem.
    final_answer = math.floor(1.0 / p_a_wins)
