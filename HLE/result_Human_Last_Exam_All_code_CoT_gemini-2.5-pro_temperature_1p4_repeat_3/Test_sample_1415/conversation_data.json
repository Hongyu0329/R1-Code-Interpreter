    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand:** The expression to be integrated is `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)`. This is a standard calculus form. The integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|f(x)| + C`. In our case, `f(x)` is `F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This gives the value `V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Determine F₃(x):**\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0):**\n    *   For x = 1: `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   For x = 0: `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n5.  **Calculate the Value V:** We will substitute the values from the previous step into the integral expression. Since `F₃(x)` is always positive for x in [0, 1], the absolute value bars are not necessary.\n    *   `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n    *   `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n6.  **Compute the Final Result:** A Python script will be used to calculate the numerical value of `V`, multiply it by 10000, and round to the nearest integer as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\ndef f3(x):\n    return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n# The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n\n# Step 2: Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0)\nval_f3_1 = f3(1)\nval_f3_0 = f3(0) # This simplifies to math.log(2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral V\n# V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = math.log(val_f3_1) - math.log(val_f3_0)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final result required by the user\nresult = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(result)\n\n# Step 5: Print the outputs showing the equation and numbers\nprint(\"The value of the definite integral is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we evaluate the terms in the equation:\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {val_f3_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) = {val_f3_0}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nPlugging these into the equation for V:\")\n# We use the equation V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nprint(f\"V = ln({val_f3_1}) - ln({val_f3_0})\")\nprint(f\"The numerical value is V ≈ {V}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinally, we calculate the requested value:\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V ≈ 10000 * {V} = {result}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {closest_integer}\")\n```\n<<<5488>>>"
