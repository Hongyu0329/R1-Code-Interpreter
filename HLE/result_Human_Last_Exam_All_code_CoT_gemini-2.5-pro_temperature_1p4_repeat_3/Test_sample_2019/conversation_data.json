    "To solve this problem, we need to find all the combinations of placing 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. A toroidal board means it wraps around on the edges.\n\nMy plan is to use a backtracking algorithm, which is a classic approach for solving N-queens type problems.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Define the Board and Queens:** The board is 5x5 (`N=5`) and we need to place 4 queens (`K=4`).\n2.  **Toroidal Attack Rules:** A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks another at `(r2, c2)` if any of the following conditions are met (with `% N` indicating the modulo operation for the wrap-around effect):\n    *   Same row: `r1 == r2`\n    *   Same column: `c1 == c2`\n    *   Same main diagonal: `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`\n    *   Same anti-diagonal: `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`\n3.  **Backtracking Search:** I will write a recursive function that tries to place one queen at a time on the board's 25 squares.\n    *   The function will keep track of the number of queens left to place and the positions of queens already on the board.\n    *   To find unique combinations (and not permutations), the search for the next queen's position will only consider squares that come after the previously placed queen's square.\n    *   At each step, before placing a new queen, we check if the potential square is \"safe\" (i.e., not attacked by any queens already on the board).\n    *   If a queen is placed successfully, the function calls itself to place the next queen. If it fails or returns, it \"backtracks\" by removing the queen and trying the next square.\n4.  **Count Solutions:** When the function successfully places all 4 queens, it means we've found a valid arrangement, and we increment a solution counter.\n5.  **Final Output:** The script will execute the search and print the total count found.\n\nThis method will systematically explore all possibilities and guarantee finding the correct total number of ways.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queens_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens\n    on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n    This solution uses a backtracking algorithm to explore all valid\n    placements systematically.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # The size of the chessboard (N x N)\n    K = 4  # The number of queens to place\n\n    # Use a list for the counter so it's mutable and can be updated by the nested function.\n    solution_count = [0]\n    \n    # Create a list of all 25 square coordinates on the board.\n    all_squares = [(r, c) for r in range(N) for c in range(N)]\n\n    def is_safe(pos, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a queen at a new position `pos` is attacked by any queen\n        in the `placements` list on the toroidal board.\n        \"\"\"\n        r1, c1 = pos\n        for r2, c2 in placements:\n            # Check for attacks on rows, columns, and both types of toroidal diagonals.\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2 or \\\n               (r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N or \\\n               (r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def find_placements_recursive(queens_to_place, start_index, current_placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        A recursive function to find all valid placements using backtracking.\n        \n        Args:\n            queens_to_place: The number of queens remaining to be placed.\n            start_index: The board square index to start searching from.
