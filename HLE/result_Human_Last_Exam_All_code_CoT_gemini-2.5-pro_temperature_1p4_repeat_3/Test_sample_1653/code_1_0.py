# Define k as a symbol
k = sympy.Symbol('k', positive=True, real=True)

# From the theoretical analysis, we found that ln(h_k) has the asymptotic behavior:
# ln(h_k) ~ -4 * ln(k)
# We want to calculate the limit of ln(h_k) / ln(k) as k -> infinity.

# Define the expression for ln(h_k)
ln_hk = -4 * sympy.log(k)

# Define the expression whose limit we want to compute
expression = ln_hk / sympy.log(k)

# Calculate the limit as k approaches infinity
limit_result = sympy.limit(expression, k, sympy.oo)

# We are asked to output the final calculation.
# The calculation is based on the derived asymptotic relationship.
# Let's present the logic.
# Step 1: Theoretical analysis leads to the relation ln(h_k) = -4 * ln(k) + o(ln(k)).
# Step 2: We need to compute lim_{k->inf} (ln(h_k) / ln(k)).
# Step 3: Substitute the asymptotic relation into the limit expression:
# lim_{k->inf} ((-4 * ln(k) + o(ln(k))) / ln(k))
# Step 4: Simplify the expression:
# lim_{k->inf} (-4 + o(ln(k))/ln(k))
# Step 5: The term o(ln(k))/ln(k) goes to 0 as k->inf.
# Step 6: The limit is -4.

# We print the final answer derived from the steps above.
