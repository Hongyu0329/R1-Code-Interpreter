    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship Isaac Newton proposed between the visible color spectrum and the musical diatonic scale.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** The query specifies a range. The start of the range is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue,\" which is **Green**. The end of the range is **Blue**.\n2.  **Consult Newton's Mapping:** Newton, in his work *Opticks*, created a color wheel where he mapped the seven colors of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) to the seven notes of a musical scale. Crucially, he placed the notes at the divisions or boundaries between the colors.\n3.  **Find the Specific Note:** We need to find the note that lies at the boundary between Green and Blue.\n    *   The note at the boundary of Yellow and Green is F.\n    *   The note at the boundary of **Green** and **Blue** is **G**.\n    *   The note at the boundary of Blue and Indigo is A.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** We will write a Python script that defines this mapping in a dictionary, identifies the required boundary, and prints the corresponding note.\n\n```python\ndef find_newtonian_note():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the musical note corresponding to a specific color range\n    on Isaac Newton's color circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to Isaac Newton's Opticks, he mapped the notes of the\n    # diatonic scale to the boundaries between the seven colors of the spectrum.\n    newton_color_boundaries_to_notes = {\n        ('Red', 'Orange'): 'D',\n        ('Orange', 'Yellow'): 'E',\n        ('Yellow', 'Green'): 'F',\n        ('Green', 'Blue'): 'G',\n        ('Blue', 'Indigo'): 'A',\n        ('Indigo', 'Violet'): 'B',\n        ('Violet', 'Red'): 'C'\n    }\n\n    # The problem asks for the note in the range between the combination\n    # of yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself.\n    start_color_of_range = \"Green\"\n    end_color_of_range = \"Blue\"\n\n    # We look for the note at the boundary between Green and Blue.\n    boundary_key = (start_color_of_range, end_color_of_range)\n\n    # Retrieve the note from the mapping.\n    musical_note = newton_color_boundaries_to_notes[boundary_key]\n\n    print(\"Newton's Color Circle maps colors to musical notes.\")\n    print(\"The starting color of the range is the combination of Yellow and Blue, which is Green.\")\n    print(\"The ending color of the range is Blue.\")\n    print(f\"The musical note at the boundary between {start_color_of_range} and {end_color_of_range} is:\")\n    print(musical_note)\n\nfind_newtonian_note()\n```\n<<<G>>>"
