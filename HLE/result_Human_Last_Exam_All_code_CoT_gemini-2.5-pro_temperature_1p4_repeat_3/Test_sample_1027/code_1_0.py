    Computes the dimension of the homology of G with trivial real coefficients in degree 31.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The group G fits into a short exact sequence 1 -> K -> G -> Z^2 -> 1,
       where K is the commutator subgroup [G,G] and Z^2 is the free abelian group of rank 2.
    2. The Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for this extension relates the homology of G
       to the homology of K and Z^2.
    3. Under the reasonable assumption that the commutator subgroup K (a group of compactly
       supported homeomorphisms related to Thompson's groups) is acyclic over the real numbers
       (i.e., H_q(K, R) = 0 for q >= 1), the spectral sequence collapses.
    4. This collapse implies that the homology of G is isomorphic to the homology of Z^2,
       i.e., H_n(G, R) ~= H_n(Z^2, R) for all n.
    5. The homology of Z^2 is the homology of the 2-torus T^2. The dimension of the k-th
       homology group is given by the Betti number b_k = C(2, k), the binomial coefficient.
    6. We need to compute the dimension for degree k=31.
