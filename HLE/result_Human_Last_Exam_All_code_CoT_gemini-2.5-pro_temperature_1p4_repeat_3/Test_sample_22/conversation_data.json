    "This statement is True.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This represents the *theoretical upper limit* of the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by all the genetic variants (SNPs) included in a given analysis. It's a population parameter that assumes we could build a perfect predictive model using the true effect sizes of all SNPs.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a *practical, real-world model* created to predict a phenotype. The score is built using effect sizes estimated from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n3.  **The Gap:** A PGS's predictive ability (measured as R²) is *necessarily* lower than the SNP heritability for two main reasons:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The effect sizes used to build the PGS are *estimates* from a GWAS with a finite number of participants. These estimates contain statistical noise (sampling error) and are not the true effect sizes.\n    *   **Imperfect Model:** The PGS model itself might not perfectly match the true genetic architecture (e.g., due to assumptions about linkage disequilibrium or effect size distributions).\n\nBecause the PGS is built with imperfect information, its ability to explain variance will always be less than the theoretical maximum defined by the SNP heritability. The predictive accuracy of a PGS approaches the SNP heritability only as the sample size of the discovery GWAS approaches infinity.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this concept using a well-known formula that predicts the expected R² of a PGS based on SNP heritability (h²_SNP), GWAS sample size (N), and the effective number of independent SNPs (M). As you will see, the calculated R² from the PGS is lower than the starting SNP heritability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Parameters ---\n# SNP heritability (the theoretical maximum variance explained by SNPs)\nh_snp_sq = 0.50\n\n# Sample size of the GWAS used to derive the PGS weights\ngwas_sample_size_N = 100000\n\n# The effective number of independent SNPs contributing to the trait.\n# This is often estimated to be around 60,000 for European ancestry.\neffective_snps_M = 60000\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# This formula predicts the expected R-squared of a polygenic score.\n# R_sq_pgs = h_snp_sq / (1 + (M / (N * h_snp_sq)))\n\n# Calculate the term in the denominator\ndenominator_term = gwas_sample_size_N * h_snp_sq\nfull_denominator = 1 + (effective_snps_M / denominator_term)\n\n# Calculate the expected R-squared of the PGS\nr_sq_pgs = h_snp_sq / full_denominator\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(f\"This script calculates the expected predictive ability (R²) of a Polygenic Score (PGS).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(f\"Inputs:\")\nprint(f\"SNP Heritability (h²_SNP): {h_snp_sq}\")\nprint(f\"GWAS Sample Size (N): {gwas_sample_size_N}\")\nprint(f\"Effective Number of SNPs (M): {effective_snps_M}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\nprint(f\"The calculation is based on the formula:\")\nprint(f\"Expected R² = h²_SNP / (1 + M / (N * h²_SNP))\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the numbers into the formula:\")\n# Here we print each number in the final equation\nprint(f\"Expected R² = {h_snp_sq} / (1 + {effective_snps_M} / ({gwas_sample_size_N} * {h_snp_sq}))\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\nprint(f\"Result:\")\nprint(f\"The calculated predictive ability of the PGS (R²) is: {r_sq_pgs:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"\\nComparison:\")\nprint(f\"The PGS R² ({r_sq_pgs:.4f}) is lower than the SNP Heritability ({h_snp_sq:.4f}).\")\n\n```\n<<<True>>>"
