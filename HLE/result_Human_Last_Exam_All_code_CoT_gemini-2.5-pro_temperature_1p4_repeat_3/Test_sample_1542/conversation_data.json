    "My plan is to solve this problem by computationally enumerating all possible quadratic forms and then partitioning them into equivalence classes.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is defined by a homogeneous polynomial $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R$. The total number of such forms is $8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear transformation of the variables. An invertible linear transformation is represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $P$ with entries in $R$, whose determinant is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are the odd numbers $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. The group of all such matrices is denoted $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe action of a matrix $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{21} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ on a quadratic form $Q(x,y)$ produces a new form $Q_{new}(x,y) = Q(p_{11}x + p_{12}y, p_{21}x + p_{22}y)$. By expanding this expression, we can find the new coefficients $(a', b', c')$ in terms of the old coefficients $(a, b, c)$ and the matrix entries.\n\nMy computational strategy is as follows:\n1.  Generate all 512 possible quadratic forms, represented by tuples $(a, b, c)$.\n2.  Generate all invertible matrices in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  Implement a function that applies the transformation rule to a form given a matrix.\n4.  Use a standard algorithm for finding equivalence classes (orbits):\n    a. Start with the set of all 512 forms.\n    b. Repeatedly pick a form from the set, find all forms equivalent to it (its orbit), and remove them from the set.\n    c. Count how many times we have to do this until the set is empty. This count gives the number of equivalence classes.\n\nThis brute-force approach is feasible because the total number of forms and transformations is relatively small for a computer. It will accurately determine the total number of distinct equivalence classes, including any degenerate cases and the zero form.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Over the finite ring R=Z/8Z, how many equivalence classes of quadratic forms\n    in two variables up to invertible linear transforms are there?\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 8\n    # The units in Z/8Z are the odd numbers.\n    units = {n for n in range(R) if n % 2 != 0}\n\n    # 1.
