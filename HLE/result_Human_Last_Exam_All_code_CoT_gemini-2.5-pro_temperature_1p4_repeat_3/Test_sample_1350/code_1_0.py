    The character in question is the chieftain of the Wolfings, Thiodolf.
    In Chapter VI, "Thiodolf telleth of the Roof of the Wolfings," he recounts
    his time as a young hostage in a Roman city. He tells his children of the
    Romans' city-founding myth, describing how they worshipped "twin brethren"
    who were suckled by a "She-wolf," a clear reference to Romulus and Remus.
