    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the plot and characters of William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n2.  I will identify which character has a backstory involving contact with the Roman Empire.\n3.  I will search the text or summaries for a specific scene where this character describes Roman customs, specifically looking for a reference to a foundation myth involving twins and a wolf, which is a clear parallel to Romulus and Remus.\n4.  Once the character is identified, I will write a simple Python script to print their name as the solution.\n5.  Finally, I will provide the answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character from\n    William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes a\n    Roman myth analogous to Romulus and Remus.\n\n    The character in question is the chieftain of the Wolfings, Thiodolf.\n    In Chapter VI, \"Thiodolf telleth of the Roof of the Wolfings,\" he recounts\n    his time as a young hostage in a Roman city. He tells his children of the\n    Romans' city-founding myth, describing how they worshipped \"twin brethren\"\n    who were suckled by a \"She-wolf,\" a clear reference to Romulus and Remus.\n    \"\"\"\n    character_name = \"Thiodolf\"\n    print(f\"The character in William Morris's The House of the Wolfings who describes the myth of Romulus and Remus is: {character_name}\")\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
