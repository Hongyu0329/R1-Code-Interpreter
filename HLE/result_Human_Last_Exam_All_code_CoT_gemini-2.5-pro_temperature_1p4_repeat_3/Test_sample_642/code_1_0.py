    # The problem asks for the limit of f(k+1) - f(k) as k -> infinity, where f(k)
    # is the minimum number of states for a Turing Machine to recognize the language
    # L = {w in {0,1}* : number of 1s in w is divisible by k}.

    # A simple DFA-like machine would require k states, leading to f(k) = k.
    # The limit of (k+1) - k would be 1.

    # However, the problem states the TM can use its tape for "state optimization".
    # This implies using the tape to store the count of '1's, for example in binary.
    # The TM's states are then used to implement an algorithm for counting and division.
    # The number of states for such a machine is dominated by the logic needed to
    # perform division by k. This logic must have k encoded in its structure.
    # The most compact representation of k is binary, which has a length of O(log k).
    # Therefore, the minimum state complexity f(k) is of the order O(log k).
    # We can model this for large k as: f(k) = c * log2(k) for some constant c.

    # Now, we compute the limit based on this model.
    # limit = lim_{k->inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)]
    # limit = lim_{k->inf} [c*log2(k+1) - c*log2(k)]
    # Using log properties: log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b)
    # limit = lim_{k->inf} c*log2((k+1)/k)
    # limit = lim_{k->inf} c*log2(1 + 1/k)

    # As k -> infinity, 1/k -> 0.
    # limit = c * log2(1 + 0)
    # limit = c * log2(1)
    
    # Since log2(1) = 0
