# Define the coefficient from the term (3/2) * (dR/dt)^2
# This term is a source of nonlinearity in the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.
# In the expansion R = 1 + y, this term becomes (3/2) * (dy/dt)^2.
# We are asked for a specific term of the nonlinear correction. Given the ambiguity
# of the question, and the fact that other nonlinear coefficients depend on the
# unspecified parameter gamma, the constant coefficient of this kinetic term
# is a strong candidate for the intended answer.

coefficient = sp.Rational(3, 2)

print("The equation is $R\\ddot{R}+\\frac{3}{2}\\dot{R}^2=R^{-3\\gamma}-1-\\frac{4}{Re}\\frac{\\dot{R}}{R}$")
