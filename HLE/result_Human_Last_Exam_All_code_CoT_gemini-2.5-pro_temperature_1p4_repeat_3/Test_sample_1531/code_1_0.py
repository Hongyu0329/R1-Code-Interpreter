    print("Result: The lines lack a consistent, repeating rhythm (like da-DUM da-DUM). The lack of regular meter and rhyme is the defining characteristic of free verse.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices ---")
    print(f"A. {choices['A']}: This is a strong possibility, as the lines lack regular meter and rhyme.")
    print(f"B. {choices['B']}: Incorrect. A ballad is a narrative form, typically with a strict rhyme scheme (like ABCB) and meter.")
    print(f"C. {choices['C']}: This is a more specific category of free verse. The concise, image-focused style and the use of an ampersand ('&') are hallmarks of the Modernist literary movement (early 20th century). This is a very precise and fitting description.")
    print(f"D. {choices['D']}: Incorrect. Iambic pentameter requires five feet of unstressed followed by stressed syllables. These lines do not fit that pattern.")
    print(f"E. {choices['E']}: While the lines do have three stresses (making them technically a form of trimeter), this term usually implies a regular rhythm, which is absent here. 'Free verse' is a more accurate description of the overall style.\n")
    
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Both 'free verse' and 'modernist free verse' are technically correct. However, 'modernist free verse' is the most specific and accurate answer because the style of the lines strongly reflects the characteristics of the Modernist poetic era. Therefore, it is the best choice.")
