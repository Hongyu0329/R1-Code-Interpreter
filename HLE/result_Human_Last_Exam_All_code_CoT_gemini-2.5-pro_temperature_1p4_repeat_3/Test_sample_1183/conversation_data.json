    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Parse SMILES to 3D Structure**: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule. I will use the `rdkit` cheminformatics library in Python to parse this string and create a molecular object.\n2.  **Generate a 3D Conformation**: Symmetry is a property of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. I will generate an initial 3D conformation of the molecule. Crucially, I will add hydrogen atoms, as they are part of the structure, and then use the MMFF94 force field to optimize the geometry. This optimization finds a stable, low-energy structure, which is essential for accurate symmetry determination. The molecule is a large, planar aromatic system, and the force field will correctly relax it into its symmetric, planar form.\n3.  **Determine the Point Group**: With an optimized 3D structure, I will use the `pymatgen` library, a powerful tool for materials analysis that includes robust symmetry-finding algorithms. I will convert the `rdkit` molecule into a `pymatgen` molecule object and then use its `PointGroupAnalyzer` to identify the Schoenflies symbol of the molecule's point group.\n4.  **Final Output**: The script will print the resulting point group symbol.\n\nThis computational approach provides a reliable way to determine the symmetry of complex molecules from their SMILES representation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit not found.
