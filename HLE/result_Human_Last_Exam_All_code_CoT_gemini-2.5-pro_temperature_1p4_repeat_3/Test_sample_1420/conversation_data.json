    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory**: The problem requires using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a key technique in the renormalization group theory of critical phenomena.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (ϵ)**: The expansion is performed around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. The parameter `ϵ` is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d` is the spatial dimension of the system. For the class of models including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, the upper critical dimension `d_c` is 4.\n3.  **Identify the System**: The problem doesn't specify the universality class (e.g., Ising, XY, Heisenberg). The most common case studied is the Ising model, which corresponds to a single-component order parameter (`n=1`). We will proceed with this standard assumption.\n4.  **Find the Formula**: To the first order in `ϵ`, the scaling exponent for the specific heat, `α`, is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n5.  **Calculate the Value**: We will substitute the values `d=3`, `d_c=4` (so `ϵ=1`), and `n=1` into the formula to calculate `α`.\n6.  **Generate the Code**: A Python script will be written to perform these calculations and print the entire process, showing how the final value is derived step-by-step, including the formula and the substitution of each number.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n\n    This calculation is for a system with spatial dimension d=3, near the\n    upper critical dimension d_c=4. It assumes the Ising universality class,\n    where the order parameter has n=1 component. The result is the first-order\n    term in the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Spatial dimension\n    d = 3\n    # Upper critical dimension\n    d_c = 4\n    # Number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for Ising model)\n    n = 1\n\n    # Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Numerator and denominator of the formula for alpha\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n\n    # Calculate alpha as a fraction and as a float\n    alpha_fraction = sympy.Rational(numerator * epsilon, denominator)\n    alpha_float = float(alpha_fraction)\n\n    # Print the explanation and step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"Calculating the specific heat scaling exponent α using the ϵ-expansion.\")\n    print(f\"The system has spatial dimension d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension for this universality class is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(f\"Assuming the Ising model, the number of order parameter components is n = {n}.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"First, we calculate ϵ = d_c - d:\")\n    print(f\"ϵ = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Next, we use the first-order formula for α:\")\n    print(\"α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Substituting the values n=1 and ϵ=1:\")\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / ({2} * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / ({2} * {n + 8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The final result is:\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha_fraction} ≈ {alpha_float}\")\n\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>\n```"
