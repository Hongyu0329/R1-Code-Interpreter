    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, we need to understand the properties of the given conductor $d=53599$. We will find its prime factorization.\n2.  The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d$ is related to the structure of the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes, say $d=p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$, the character group is a product of character groups for each prime: $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\cong \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/p_1\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\dots \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/p_r\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$.\n3.  A character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if its component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-trivial for each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$. A non-trivial character is any character that is not the principal character (which has order 1).\n4.  The order of a character $\\chi = (\\chi_{p_1}, \\dots, \\chi_{p_r})$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1}), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_r}))$.\n5.  We need this order to be 6. This means the order of each component, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_i})$, must be a divisor of 6, and for the lcm to be exactly 6, at least one component must have order divisible by 2, and at least one must have order divisible by 3.\n6.  We can solve this by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters whose order divides $k$. The number of characters of order exactly 6 is given by the formula:\n    $N_{=6} = N(\\text{dividing } 6) - N(\\text{dividing } 3) - N(\\text{dividing } 2) + N(\\text{dividing } 1)$.\n7.  We will calculate each of these terms. $N(\\text{dividing } m)$ is the product, over all prime factors $p$ of $d$, of the number of non-trivial characters modulo $p$ whose order divides $m$.\n\nNow, let's execute this plan with a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef main():\n    d = 53599\n    order_k = 6\n    \n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order {order_k}.\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Factor the conductor d\n    prime_factors_d = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(prime_factors_d.keys())\n    num_prime_factors = len(primes)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Find the prime factorization of d.\")\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {d} is {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}.\")\n    \n    is_square_free = all(v == 1 for v in prime_factors_d.values())\n    if not is_square_free:\n        print(\"The conductor d is not square-free.
