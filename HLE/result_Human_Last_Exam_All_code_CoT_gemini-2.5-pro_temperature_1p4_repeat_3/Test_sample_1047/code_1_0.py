    # The core legal principles at play are the duty of confidentiality to a former client

    # 1. Duty of Confidentiality: NC LLP represented Advanced Tech Inc. (ATI) and gained
    #    access to highly sensitive information (financials, contracts, etc.). This duty
    #    to keep information confidential is permanent and does not end when the client leaves.
    duty_of_confidentiality = True

    # 2. Relevance of Information: The information NC LLP holds is directly relevant to
    #    the proposed acquisition of ATI by Six Wings Inc. (SWI). This information could
    #    be used to the disadvantage of the former client, ATI.
    information_is_relevant = True

    # 3. Direct Adversity: Representing SWI in its acquisition of ATI places NC LLP in a
    #    position directly adverse to its former client, ATI.
    is_directly_adverse = True

    # 4. Conflict of Interest: The combination of these factors (possessing relevant confidential
    #    information while acting in a directly adverse matter) creates a clear conflict of interest.
    conflict_exists = duty_of_confidentiality and information_is_relevant and is_directly_adverse

    # 5. Consent: Such a conflict can sometimes be waived with the informed consent of the
    #    affected party. The problem explicitly states that ATI will NOT consent.
    consent_given = False

    # Conclusion: Because a conflict exists and the prejudiced former client has not given
    # consent, NC LLP is disqualified from representing Six Wings Inc. This matches choice D.

    Step-by-Step Reasoning:
    1.  A law firm's duty to protect a former client's confidential information is permanent. NC LLP possesses highly sensitive information about Advanced Tech Inc. from their previous work together.
    2.  This confidential information (financials, contracts, etc.) is directly relevant to the new matter, the proposed acquisition of Advanced Tech Inc. by Six Wings Inc. There is a clear risk this information could be used to Advanced Tech Inc.'s detriment.
    3.  This situation creates a disqualifying conflict of interest. The firm is acting directly against a former client in a matter where the former client's confidential information is at risk.
    4.  While an "ethical wall" (like the one between the litigation and commercial groups) can sometimes resolve a conflict, it is generally insufficient in a case of such direct adversity without the former client's agreement.
    5.  The key mechanism to overcome such a conflict is receiving informed consent from the party that would be prejudiced (Advanced Tech Inc.).
    6.  The scenario explicitly states that Advanced Tech Inc. will not provide consent.
    7.  Therefore, because a conflict exists and consent from the prejudiced former client is not given, NC LLP cannot continue to represent Six Wings Inc. This aligns perfectly with answer choice D.
