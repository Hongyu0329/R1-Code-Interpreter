    This script calculates the smallest natural number N with the specified property for quadratic forms.

    The problem asks for the smallest natural number N such that for every anisotropic
    quadratic form Q in N variables over a field K, the map defined by Q is surjective.

    The field K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2,
    with a residue field k that is a local field of characteristic 2.

    # The u-invariant of the residue field k (a local field of char 2) is 4.
    # This is the maximum dimension of an anisotropic quadratic form over k.
    u_k = 4

    # By an analogue of Springer's Theorem, the u-invariant of K is determined by that of k.
    # An anisotropic form Q over K decomposes as q1 + pi*q2, where the residue forms
    # q1_bar and q2_bar are anisotropic over k.
    # The maximum dimension for Q to be anisotropic is u(K) = u(k) + u(k).

    # If N = u(K) + 1 = 9, there are no anisotropic forms, so the condition is vacuously true.
    # We must check if a smaller N works.

    # For N=7, we can construct a non-surjective anisotropic form.
    # This form is built from a 4-dim and a 3-dim anisotropic form over k.
    # A 3-dim anisotropic form over k is NOT surjective. This prevents the 7-dim form over K
    # from being surjective. Thus, N must be greater than 7.
    
    # For N=8, any anisotropic form Q must be built from two 4-dim anisotropic forms over k.
    # A 4-dim anisotropic form over k IS surjective. This property can be lifted to K
    # to show that Q is surjective over K.

    # Therefore, the smallest N is 8.
