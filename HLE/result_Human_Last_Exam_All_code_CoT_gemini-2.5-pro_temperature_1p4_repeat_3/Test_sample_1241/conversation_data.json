    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, as time $t$ approaches infinity ($t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nWhen the system reaches a steady state, the rate of change of each probability is zero, meaning $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. This transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nHere is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Set derivatives to zero**: We will set $P_i'(t) = 0$ in the given system of equations.\n2.  **Formulate linear equations**: This gives us a system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$, along with the normalization condition $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$.\n3.  **Solve the system**: We will solve this system of equations. The most straightforward way is to express $p_0, p_2,$ and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n4.  **Use the normalization condition**: Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation to find the numerical value of $p_1$.\n5.  **Calculate p0**: Once $p_1$ is known, we can calculate $p_0$.\n6.  **Calculate the final sum**: Finally, we compute the required sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nThe steady-state equations are:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_{0} + 0.65 p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.4 p_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) p_{2}$\n3.  $0 = 0.008 p_{2} - 0.008 p_{3}$\n4.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$. Then we'll use the normalization condition to find their values. The following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# These are the transition rates given in the problem\nlambda01 = 0.019\nlambda10 = 0.65\nlambda12 = 0.4\nlambda21 = 0.392\nlambda23 = 0.008\nlambda31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), the derivatives P_i'(t) are 0.\n# This gives a system of linear equations. Let p_i be the steady-state probabilities P_i(+inf).\n#\n# 0 = -lambda01*p0 + lambda10*p1  => p0 = (lambda10 / lambda01) * p1\n# 0 = lambda12*p1 - (lambda21 + lambda23)*p2 => p2 = (lambda12 / (lambda21 + lambda23)) * p1\n# 0 = lambda23*p2 - lambda31*p3 => p3 = (lambda23 / lambda31) * p2\n# And the normalization condition: p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n#\n# Let's express p0, p2, and p3 as multiples of p1.\n# Let p0 = c0*p1, p2 = c2*p1, p3 = c3*p2 = c3*c2*p1\n\nc0 = lambda10 / lambda01\nc2 = lambda12 / (lambda21 + lambda23)\nc3 = lambda23 / lambda31\n\n# Now substitute these into the normalization equation:\n# c0*p1 + p1 + c2*p1 + c3*c2*p1 = 1\n# p1 * (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3*c2) = 1\n# p1 = 1 / (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3*c2)\n\ndenominator = c0 + 1 + c2 + c3 * c2\n\n# Now we can calculate the values for p1 and then p0\np1 = 1 / denominator\np0 = c0 * p1\n\n# The value we need to find is p0 + p1\nresult = p0 + p1\n\n# As requested, we print the components of the final sum.\nprint(f\"The steady-state probability P0(+inf) is: {p0}\")\nprint(f\"The steady-state probability P1(+inf) is: {p1}\")\nprint(f\"The final sum P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) is: {p0} + {p1} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
