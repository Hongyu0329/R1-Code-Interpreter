# Part A: What is the dimension of pi's fibers?
# The physical state of the crystal is described by a field C.
# The problem states C is a "vector bundle connection on TR^3" and that "dC is the Burgers' Vector".
# This implies the field C describes local distortions including dislocations (torsion).
# In modern continuum mechanics, such a field is modeled in several equivalent ways:
# 1. As a metric-compatible connection: This imposes a physical constraint that preserves local lengths and angles.
#    The connection is specified by 3 matrices in the Lie Algebra so(3). Each matrix has 3 independent components.
#    Total components = 3 * 3 = 9.
# 2. As the distortion tensor C_ij: A general rank-2 tensor describing the deformation of the lattice vectors.
#    This has 3x3 = 9 components. The dislocation density is then curl(C).
# These physical interpretations consistently point to a field with 9 independent components.
# Therefore, the dimension of the fiber space is 9.
fiber_dimension = 9

# Part B: How many coefficients specify E?
# The energy density E must be a scalar invariant under the cubic symmetry group.
# The constraints (linear dynamics, homogeneous polynomial, detecting dislocations) imply that E is a quadratic
# form of the dislocation density tensor alpha, which is derived from the derivatives of C (alpha ~ dC).
# alpha is a general rank-2 tensor field with 9 components.
# The problem reduces to finding the number of independent quadratic invariants of a general rank-2 tensor
# under the cubic symmetry group O_h.
# Using group theory, the 9-dimensional space of rank-2 tensors decomposes into 4 irreducible representations
# for the cubic group:
# 1. A_1g (from the trace part, dimension 1)
# 2. T_1g (from the anti-symmetric part, dimension 3)
# 3. E_g   (from the symmetric-traceless part, dimension 2)
# 4. T_2g  (from the symmetric-traceless part, dimension 3)
# (Check: 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 9)
# Each irreducible representation corresponds to one independent quadratic invariant.
# Therefore, there are 4 independent coefficients that specify the energy E.
energy_coefficients = 4

# Print the final answer in the specified format.
print(f"{fiber_dimension} {energy_coefficients}")
# Expected output format is just the numbers, so the above printout is correct.
# Final Answer: 9 4
# The final equation would be of the form E = c1*I1 + c2*I2 + c3*I3 + c4*I4, where I_k are the four invariants.
# Number 1 in the final equation: 9
# Number 2 in the final equation: 4
