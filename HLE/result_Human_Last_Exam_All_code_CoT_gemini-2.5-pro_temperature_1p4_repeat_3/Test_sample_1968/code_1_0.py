    print("This problem deals with a question in combinatorial set theory, specifically about partition relations for cardinals.")
    print("The existence of the function f depends on the properties of the infinite cardinal kappa.\n")
    
    # Step-by-step reasoning
    print("Step 1: Rephrasing the question into the language of partition calculus.")
    print("The problem asks whether there exists a function f: [kappa^+]^2 -> kappa such that for every subset x of kappa^+ of order type kappa+1, the image size |f''[x]^2| is kappa.")
    print("The negation of this would be: for any function f, there exists some set x of type kappa+1 where the image size is less than kappa.")
    print("In the notation of partition calculus, the property that such a function *exists* is written as:")
    print("    kappa^+  --|>  [kappa+1]^2_{<kappa}")
    print("This notation means that there exists a coloring of pairs from kappa^+ with kappa colors, such that no set of type kappa+1 has its pairs colored by a set of fewer than kappa colors.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyzing the case where kappa is a regular cardinal.")
    print("A foundational result in this area, proved by AndrÃ¡s Hajnal, states that for any regular cardinal kappa, the following positive partition relation holds:")
    print("    kappa^+  -->  (kappa+1)^2_{kappa}")
    print("This theorem means that for *any* function f mapping pairs from kappa^+ to kappa, there must exist a 'monochromatic' subset H of kappa^+ with order type kappa+1.")
    print("A monochromatic set H is one where f is constant for all pairs taken from H. This means the image f''[H]^2 has a size of just 1.")
    print("Since kappa is an infinite cardinal, 1 is strictly less than kappa.")
    print("Therefore, for any regular cardinal kappa, no function can satisfy the required property, because we can always find a set x for which |f''[x]^2| = 1, not kappa.")
    print("This rules out the existence of such a function for regular cardinals like omega, omega_1, etc.\n")

    print("Step 3: Analyzing the case where kappa is a singular cardinal.")
    print("For singular cardinals, the situation is completely different. The celebrated work of Saharon Shelah showed that the previous partition relation fails for singulars.")
    print("Shelah proved that if kappa is a singular cardinal, the following negative partition relation holds:")
    print("    kappa^+  --|>  [kappa+1]^2_{<kappa}")
    print("This is precisely the property the question is asking about. It asserts the existence of a function f: [kappa^+]^2 -> kappa such that for *every* subset x of kappa^+ with order type kappa+1, the size of the image |f''[x]^2| is not less than kappa.")
    print("Since the codomain of f is kappa, the image size cannot exceed kappa. Thus, for every such x, we must have |f''[x]^2| = kappa.")
    print("Therefore, if kappa is a singular cardinal, such a function is guaranteed to exist.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclusion.")
    print("By combining these two results, we conclude that the function described in the problem exists if and only if the infinite cardinal kappa is singular.")
