    1. High temperature causes an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress.
    2. The cell's primary and most rapid response to a sudden increase in ROS is to increase the activity of specific enzymes designed to neutralize them.
    3. Enzymes like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) are the first line of defense. SOD converts superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide, and CAT breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
    4. This system is known collectively as 'enzymatic antioxidants'. Their activation (i.e., increased catalytic rate) is the most immediate countermeasure.
    5. Other antioxidants (liposoluble, hydrosoluble) are also crucial but are either part of a standing defense or act in concert with the enzymatic system, which is the prime mover in the initial response.
