    Calculates the maximal probability p for Alice's guessing game.

    The optimal strategy for Alice is to:
    1. Choose to open 19 out of the 20 boxes, leaving one box closed at random.
    2. Observe the minimum (y_min) and maximum (y_max) of the 19 numbers.
    3. Guess that the number in the closed box is in the interval (y_min, y_max).

    This guess fails only if the number in the closed box is the global minimum or
