    "To find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, we can use a computational approach. A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Algorithmic Approach**: I will use a recursive backtracking algorithm (a form of depth-first search) to count all possible self-avoiding walks of a given length. The function will explore paths step-by-step from the origin (0,0).\n2.  **State Representation**: The state of our recursive search at any point will be defined by the number of steps remaining, the current position on the lattice, and the set of all positions visited so far.\n3.  **Self-avoidance**: At each step of the walk, we will check if the next potential position has already been visited. If it has, that path is discarded. If not, the search continues from the new position.\n4.  **Symmetry Optimization**: A square lattice is highly symmetric. The number of walks starting with a move to the right is the same as starting with a move up, down, or left. I will calculate the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., right, from (0,0) to (1,0)) and then multiply the result by 4 to get the total number of walks. This significantly reduces the computation time.\n5.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script that implements this recursive search. The script will calculate the number of 9-step walks starting from (1,0) (with (0,0) also marked as visited), multiply this by 4, and print the final equation and result for `a(10)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 10\n    \n    # It's good practice to have a higher recursion limit for deep recursion,\n    # though for N=10, the default limit is typically sufficient.\n    # We increase it to be safe.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(max(sys.getrecursionlimit(), N + 5))\n\n    def count_walks_recursive(steps_left, current_pos, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of valid walk extensions from a given state.\n        \n        Args:\n            steps_left: Number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            current_pos: The current (x, y) coordinate tuple.\n            visited: A set of visited (x, y) coordinate tuples.\n        \n        Returns:\n            The number of unique self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: if no steps are left, we have found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        x, y = current_pos\n        # The four possible moves on a Manhattan (square) lattice.\n        moves = [(x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)]\n\n        for next_pos in moves:\n            # If the next position is not already in our path, explore it.\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                # Add the new position to the path.\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                # Recursively call to continue the walk.\n                count += count_walks_recursive(steps_left - 1, next_pos, visited)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to explore other paths from the current position.\n                visited.remove(next_pos)\n        \n        return count\n\n    # Due to the grid's symmetry, we can calculate the number of walks for one\n    # starting direction (e.g., right) and multiply the result by 4.\n    # The walk starts at (0,0). We fix the first step to be to (1,0).\n    # This leaves us needing to count the number of (N-1)-step walks from (1,0).\n    start_pos = (1, 0)\n    \n    # The visited set must initially contain both the origin and the first step's position.\n    initial_visited = {(0, 0), start_pos}\n    \n    # Calculate the number of valid walks for this one starting direction.\n    count_one_direction = count_walks_recursive(N - 1, start_pos, initial_visited)\n\n    # The total number of walks is 4 times this count.\n    total_walks = 4 * count_one_direction\n    \n    # Print the final equation with all its numeric components as requested.\n    print(f\"a({N}) = 4 * {count_one_direction} = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
