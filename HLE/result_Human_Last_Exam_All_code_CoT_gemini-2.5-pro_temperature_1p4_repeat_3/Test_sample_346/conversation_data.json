    "To solve this problem, we need to find the integer value `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression and then calculate its base-2 logarithm.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent SKI Combinators**: The combinators S, K, and I will be represented as higher-order functions (lambda functions) in Python.\n    *   `S f g x = f(x)(g(x))`\n    *   `K f g = f`\n    *   `I f = f`\n2.  **Construct the Expression**: The complex SKI expression will be built by composing these lambda functions according to the structure of the given expression.\n3.  **Evaluate the Church Numeral**: A Church numeral `n` is a function that applies another function `f` to an argument `x`, `n` times. To find the integer value of our expression, we will apply it to a successor function ( `f = lambda i: i + 1` ) and a starting value ( `x = 0` ). The result of this application will be the integer `n`.\n4.  **Calculate the Logarithm**: Once the integer `n` is found, we will use Python's `math` library to compute `log_2(n)`.\n5.  **Output the Result**: The final result will be printed in the format `log_2(n) = result`.\n\nDue to the nature of combinator evaluation, this process can involve very deep recursion. The Python script will increase the recursion limit to handle this.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\n# To handle the deep recursion that can occur when evaluating combinator expressions,\n# we increase Python's default recursion limit to a sufficiently large value.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(300000)\n\n# Step 1: Define the fundamental SKI combinators as higher-order functions (lambdas).\nS = lambda x: lambda y: lambda z: x(z)(y(z))\nK = lambda x: lambda y: x\nI = lambda x: x\n\n# Step 2: Construct the complex SKI expression given in the problem.\n# The expression is: S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\n# We build this function by applying the combinators to each other, following the rules of application.\n\n# Let's define the recurring sub-expression for clarity: A = S(S(K(S))(K))\nA = S(S(K(S))(K))\n\n# Another recurring part is the Church numeral for 2: C2 = S(I)(I)\nC2 = S(I)(I)\n\n# Now, we build the main expression from the inside out.\n# The expression's structure is: S(I)(Y)(Z)\n# where Y = S(I)(S(I)(K(A(I))))\n# and   Z = A(C2)\n\n# Build the Y part:\npart_A_I = A(I)\npart_K_A_I = K(part_A_I)\npart_S_I_K_A_I = S(I)(part_K_A_I)\nY = S(I)(part_S_I_K_A_I)\n\n# Build the Z part:\nZ = A(C2)\n\n# Assemble the final expression, which corresponds to our Church numeral 'n'.\nchurch_n_func = S(I)(Y)(Z)\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the Church numeral to get its integer value.\n# A Church numeral 'n' represents the function `lambda f: lambda x: f(f(...f(x)...))` (f applied n times).\n# To find the integer value, we provide a successor function for 'f' and zero for 'x'.\nsuccessor = lambda i: i + 1\nzero = 0\n\n# The application church_n_func(successor)(zero) will compute the integer n.\nn = church_n_func(successor)(zero)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate log_2(n).\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# Step 5: Print the final answer in the requested format, showing the calculated values.\nprint(f\"log_2({n}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<8.0>>>"
