def solve_inscribed_square():
    """
    This function determines and prints the shortest sequence of commands
    to construct a square inscribed in a circle.

    The allowed commands are:
    - C: Draw a circle using an existing point for the center and another for the radius.
    - L: Draw a straight line connecting two existing points.

    The construction logic is as follows:
    1. L: Draw a line through the center (O) and the given point on the circumference (A)
       to define the first diameter and find the opposite vertex (B).
    2. C: Draw a circle centered at A with radius AO.
    3. C: Draw a circle centered at B with radius BO. These two circles create the
       intersection points needed for a perpendicular bisector.
    4. L: Draw a line between the two new intersection points. This line is the
       second diameter, defining the last two vertices (C and D).
    5. L: Draw the first side of the square by connecting two adjacent vertices.
    6. L: Draw the second side.
    7. L: Draw the third side.
    8. L: Draw the final side to complete the square.
