    print("Let's analyze choice C: 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for Zma1. Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site on Zma1. Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.'")
    
    print("\n- Part 1: 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for Zma1.'")
    print(f"  This is correct. Al1 is an activator (kcat increases from {kcat['control']} to {kcat['al1']}), and Al2 is an inhibitor (kcat decreases from {kcat['control']} to {kcat['al2']}).")
    
    print("\n- Part 2: 'Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site on Zma1.'")
    print(f"  This is supported by the data. The kcat with Al2 alone is {kcat['al2']}/second. When the powerful activator Al1 is added with Al2, the kcat remains at {kcat['al1_al2']}/second.")
    print("  This indicates that Al1 and Al2 are competing for the same site, and the inhibitor Al2's effect is dominant.")

    print("\n- Part 3: 'Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.'")
    print(f"  This is correct, as explained in Step 2. Unlike a reversible inhibitor, its effect is not overcome by high substrate concentration (kcat remains at {kcat['rga1_high_substrate']}).")
