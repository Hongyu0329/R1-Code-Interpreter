    "The task is to compute the Hopf charge for a given 3D vector field. The Hopf charge, a topological invariant, can be determined by calculating the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target sphere S². I will follow this topological approach, which is more robust than attempting a direct, and often complicated, integration of the Whitehead formula.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the vector field `n=(nx, ny, nz)` in the Python code to represent the problem mathematically.\n2.  Choose two antipodal points on the sphere S², the North Pole `(0,0,1)` and the South Pole `(0,0,-1)`.\n3.  Analytically find the sets of points in 3D space `(x,y,z)` that map to these two poles. These sets are the preimages.\n4.  The preimages will turn out to be simple geometric curves in 3D space.\n5.  Determine the linking number of these two curves based on their geometry. This linking number is the Hopf charge.\n6.  The Python script will encapsulate this reasoning in comments and print the final integer result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The vector field (nx, ny, nz) is a map from R^3 to the unit sphere S^2.\n# Its components are defined as follows:\nPI = np.pi\n\ndef define_field_parameters(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the intermediate parameters G and f\n    based on the space coordinates (x,y,z).\n    \"\"\"\n    # f is the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane.\n    f = np.arctan2(y, x)\n    \n    # r2 is a toroidal radius, centered on a circle of radius sqrt(0.5).\n    r_squared = x*x + y*y\n    r2 = np.sqrt((r_squared - 0.5)**2 + z*z)\n    \n    # G is the polar angle on the sphere, determined by r2.\n    G = PI * np.exp(-10 * r2)\n    \n    return G, f\n\n# The Hopf charge of this vector field can be computed using a topological method.\n# It is defined as the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values\n# on the target sphere. We choose the North Pole (0,0,1) and the South Pole (0,0,-1)\n# as our two points.\n\n# Analysis Step 1: Find the preimage of the South Pole n=(0,0,-1)\n# The condition for the South Pole is nz = -1.\n# Given nz = cos(G), this means cos(G) = -1.\n# This equality holds if G = (2k + 1) * PI for any integer k.\n# From the definition of G, we have PI * exp(-10*r2) = (2k+1)*PI.\n# => exp(-10*r2) = 2k + 1.\n# Since r2 is real and non-negative, exp(-10*r2) must be in the interval (0, 1].\n# The only integer k that satisfies this is k=0, which gives exp(-10*r2) = 1.\n# This implies -10*r2 = 0, so r2 = 0.\n# For r2 to be zero, both terms in its definition must be zero:\n# 1) z*z = 0  => z = 0\n# 2) (x*x + y*y - 0.5)**2 = 0  => x*x + y*y = 0.5\n# So, the preimage of the South Pole is a circle in the z=0 plane with radius sqrt(0.5).\n\n# Analysis Step 2: Find the preimage of the North Pole n=(0,0,1)\n# The condition for the North Pole is nz = 1.\n# cos(G) = 1, which holds if G = 2k*PI for any integer k.\n# PI * exp(-10*r2) = 2k*PI => exp(-10*r2) = 2k.\n# For exp(-10*r2) to be in (0, 1], the only integer solution is k=0.\n# This gives G = 0.\n# This equality holds only in the limit r2 -> infinity.\n# The preimage of the North Pole is the set of points at infinity. Topologically,\n# this can be represented as a line passing through the origin, such as the z-axis,\n# which is considered a loop closed at the point at infinity.\n\n# Analysis Step 3: Calculate the Linking Number\n# The Hopf charge is the linking number of the two preimages found above:\n# Curve 1 (preimage of South Pole): The circle x^2+y^2=0.5 in the z=0 plane.\n# Curve 2 (preimage of North Pole): The z-axis (x=0, y=0).\n# A straight line (the z-axis) passing through the center of a circle has a\n# linking number of 1 with the circle.\n\n# Conclusion: The Hopf charge is 1.\nhopf_charge = 1\n\n# Final Equation: Hopf Charge = 1\nprint(\"The Hopf charge is calculated via a topological analysis:\")\nprint(\"1. The preimage of the South Pole is the circle x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0.\")\nprint(\"2. The preimage of the North Pole is topologically equivalent to the z-axis.\")\nprint(\"3. The linking number of this circle and the z-axis is 1.\")\nprint(\"Final result of the calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Hopf Charge = {hopf_charge}\")\n<<<1>>>\n```"
