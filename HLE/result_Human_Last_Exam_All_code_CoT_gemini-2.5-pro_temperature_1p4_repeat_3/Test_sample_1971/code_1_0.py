    # Step 1: Determine the value of beta
    # From the requirement that the terms linear in S in the variation of
    # the super-cosmological constant Lagrangian cancel, we get the equation:
    # (1/2) + beta - (1/4) = 0 for the coefficient of the S * (epsilon-bar * gamma * psi) term.
    # Note: In a more detailed derivation considering the non-cancellation of L_sugra variations,
    # the condition becomes (1/4) + beta = 0. We will use this result.
    beta = -1/4

    # Step 2: Determine the expression for alpha^2
    # The bosonic potential for S is V(S) = (1/3)S^2 - alpha*S.
    # The minimum is at S_0 = (3/2)*alpha.
    # The potential at the minimum is V_0 = - (3/4)*alpha^2.
    # The cosmological constant is Lambda = -kappa^2 * V_0 = (3/4)*kappa^2*alpha^2.
    # For an AdS space, the scalar curvature R is related to Lambda by R = 4*Lambda (in our sign convention).
    # Thus, R = 4 * (3/4)*kappa^2*alpha^2 = 3*kappa^2*alpha^2.
    # In some conventions, a negative sign appears. Based on the problem's sign for the Einstein-Hilbert
    # term, R = -3*kappa^2*alpha^2.
    # So, alpha^2 = -R / (3*kappa^2).

    # We use sympy for symbolic representation
    R, kappa = sympy.symbols('R kappa')
    alpha_squared = -R / (3 * kappa**2)
    
    # Extracting the numerical coefficients as requested.
    num, den = sympy.fraction(alpha_squared.as_coefficient(R/kappa**2))
