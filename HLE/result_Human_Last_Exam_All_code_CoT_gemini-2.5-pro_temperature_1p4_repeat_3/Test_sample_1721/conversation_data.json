    "This problem asks for the largest possible density `c` of a set of integers `A` from `{1, ..., N}` such that the sum of any two elements from `A` (the sumset `A+A`) is never a perfect square. This is a well-known and difficult problem in additive number theory.\n\nMy plan to find the value of `c` is as follows:\n1.  I will first explore simple constructions using modular arithmetic to find a good lower bound for `c`. This involves finding a modulus `m` and a set of residues `S` such that for any two elements `s1, s2` in `S`, their sum `s1+s2` is not a quadratic residue modulo `m`.\n2.  A straightforward example is using modulus `m=3`. The quadratic residues modulo 3 are `{0, 1}`. If we construct our set `A` from numbers congruent to `1` modulo `3`, any sum of two elements will be congruent to `1+1=2` modulo `3`. Since 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 3, no sum can be a perfect square. This construction gives a density `c = 1/3`.\n3.  For a long time, `c=1/3` was conjectured to be the maximum possible density. However, this conjecture was disproven. I will refer to the mathematical literature to find the current record for the value of `c`.\n4.  The current record was established by I. Ruzsa, C. Trujillo, and J. Cilleruelo, who found a more intricate construction. They demonstrated the existence of a set with a density of `c = 23/68`.\n5.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that outlines these findings and presents the calculation for the largest known `c`, fulfilling the request to output the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# The task is to determine the largest possible density 'c' for a set A\n# of integers within {1, ..., N} such that A+A contains no perfect squares.\n# This means for any a_1, a_2 in A, a_1 + a_2 is not a square number.\n\n# A common method to construct such a set is using modular arithmetic.\n# We can find a modulus 'm' and a subset of residues 'S' such that the\n# sumset S+S does not overlap with the set of quadratic residues modulo m.\n\n# Step 1: A simple construction with modulus 3\n# The squares modulo 3 are {0^2 % 3, 1^2 % 3, 2^2 % 3} = {0, 1, 1} = {0, 1}.\n# If we choose our set A to only contain numbers congruent to 1 (mod 3),\n# then for any a_1, a_2 in A, their sum is a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 (mod 3).\n# Since 2 is not a square modulo 3, no sum a_1 + a_2 can be a square number.\n# This gives a density c = 1/3.\nc_simple_numerator = 1\nc_simple_denominator = 3\nc_simple_value = c_simple_numerator / c_simple_denominator\n\nprint(\"A simple construction based on modulo 3 yields a density 'c':\")\nprint(f\"c = {c_simple_numerator} / {c_simple_denominator} ≈ {c_simple_value:.5f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n\n# Step 2: The largest known density from mathematical research\n# For many years, it was conjectured that c=1/3 was the maximum possible density.\n# This was disproven by I. Ruzsa, C. Trujillo, and J. Cilleruelo, who found\n# a denser construction using modulus m=68.
