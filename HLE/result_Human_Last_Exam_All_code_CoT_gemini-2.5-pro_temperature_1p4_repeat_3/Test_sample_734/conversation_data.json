    "The user is asking a historical/theological question but has requested the answer be delivered within a code block. I will first identify the theologian based on the specific criteria provided and then present this finding in a simple Python script as requested.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The key requirements are a Christian theologian who developed \"specialized terminology\" for \"changes in the laws of nature\" that could explain both the \"virgin birth of Jesus\" (a miracle) and \"alterations in natural laws at the Fall\" (a systemic change).\n2.  **Identify the Theologian and Terminology:** The theologian who fits this description most precisely is **Augustine of Hippo**. He developed the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (in Latin), which can be translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons.\"\n3.  **Explain the Concept:** Augustine argued that in the initial act of creation, God embedded all the potentialities of what would later come to exist into the world in these *rationes seminales*.\n    *   **Normal Natural Law:** The regular, predictable functioning of the world is the ordinary unfolding of these embedded potentialities.\n    *   **Miracles (e.g., Virgin Birth):** A miracle is not a violation of God's created order. Instead, it is God directly activating a potentiality (*ratio seminalis*) that was embedded in creation from the beginning but lies outside the *usual* course of nature.\n    *   **The Fall:** The negative changes to the natural world after the Fall (e.g., the ground producing thorns and thistles) can be understood as the activation of latent, negative potentialities that came into effect as a consequence of sin.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will create a Python script that uses a `print()` function to output the name of the theologian who developed this framework.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Christian theologian\n    who developed the concept of \"rationes seminales\" (seminal reasons)\n    to explain changes in the natural order.\n\n    This framework accounts for miracles like the virgin birth and systemic\n    alterations to nature, such as those believed to have occurred at the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(f\"The theologian who developed this terminology was: {theologian_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
