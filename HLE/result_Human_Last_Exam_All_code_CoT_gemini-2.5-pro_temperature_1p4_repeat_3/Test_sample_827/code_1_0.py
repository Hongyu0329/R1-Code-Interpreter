    print("δ 8.69 (t, J = 5.7 Hz, 1H): This triplet corresponds to an N-H proton coupled to an adjacent CH2 group. This signal is from the benzylamino (-NH-CH2-Ph) moiety.")
    print("δ 8.24 (s, 1H): A singlet in the aromatic region, indicating a lone proton on the central heteroaromatic ring.")
    print("δ 8.11 (s, 1H): Another singlet, likely an N-H proton. This can be assigned to the N-H from the hydrazinyl group (-NH-NH-tBu) attached to the ring.")
    print("δ 7.37 – 7.22 (m, 5H): This multiplet integrating to 5 protons is the classic pattern for a monosubstituted phenyl group, which comes from the benzylamine reactant.")
    print("δ 4.73 (d, J = 6.0 Hz, 2H): This doublet is the CH2 group of the benzylamino moiety, coupled to the N-H proton at 8.69 ppm.")
    print("δ 1.70 (s, 9H): A sharp singlet integrating to 9 protons is the unmistakable signal of a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), which comes from the tert-butyl hydrazine reactant.")
