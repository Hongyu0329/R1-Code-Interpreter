# The problem is to find the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval [0,1]
# and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric.

# As explained in the plan, this problem simplifies to finding the distance
# between two simpler intervals derived from the original spaces.
# The length of the first interval is L1.
L1 = 1 / 2

# The length of the second interval is L2.
L2 = math.pi

# The Gromov-Hausdorff distance 'D' between two intervals [0, L1] and [0, L2]
# is calculated using the formula: D = (1/2) * |L1 - L2|.
distance = 0.5 * abs(L1 - L2)
