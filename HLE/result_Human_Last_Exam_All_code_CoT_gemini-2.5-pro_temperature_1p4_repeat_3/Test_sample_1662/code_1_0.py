    The question asks to identify which pair of renowned ballet institutions uses an 'allongé' (elongated/stretched) arm position with bent knees as a preparation for pirouettes starting from the fourth position.

    Here's a breakdown of the typical styles:

    1.  **Vaganova (Russian), Royal Ballet (English), La Scala (Italian/Cecchetti):** These influential methods traditionally emphasize a rounded arm position for pirouette preparations from the fourth position. This helps dancers find and maintain their center of balance. Therefore, options including these schools (A, C, D, E) are unlikely to be the correct answer.

    2.  **Paris Opera Ballet School (French School):** The French style is characterized by its elegance, precision, and often more open, elongated arm lines ('port de bras'). An 'allongé' arm position in preparation for pirouettes is a feature of this technique.

    3.  **School of American Ballet (Balanchine Method):** The Balanchine style, developed by George Balanchine, is famous for its speed, musicality, and distinct aesthetic. A key characteristic of the Balanchine pirouette preparation from fourth position is the use of sharp, open, 'allongé' arms, often with palms facing down.

    Conclusion: Both the French school (represented by the Paris Opera Ballet School) and the Balanchine method (represented by the School of American Ballet) are known for this specific preparation. Therefore, the correct pair is the Paris Opera Ballet School and the School of American Ballet.
