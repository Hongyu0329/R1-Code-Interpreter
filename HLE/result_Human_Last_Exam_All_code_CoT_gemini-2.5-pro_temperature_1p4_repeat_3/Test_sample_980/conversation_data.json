    "To find the next number in the sequence, I will first analyze the structure of the sequence itself rather than looking for an external source. The sequence features many repeating numbers, which suggests that the pattern might be based on groups of identical consecutive numbers.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Group the Sequence**: I'll parse the sequence into groups of identical consecutive numbers, noting the value and the count for each group. For example, `(67, 67, 67)` becomes a group with value `67` and count `3`.\n2.  **Analyze Group Patterns**: I will create a new sequence of these (value, count) pairs and look for a pattern, especially towards the end of the sequence.\n3.  **Identify the Sub-pattern**: The tail end of the sequence is `..., 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`. When grouped, this becomes `(10, 1), (36, 3), (124, 3), (36, 1), (124, 1)`.\n4.  **Extrapolate the Pattern**:\n    *   The sequence of *values* is `..., 10, 36, 124, 36, 124`. The last four values establish a clear alternating pattern of `36, 124`. The next value in this pattern would be `36`.\n    *   The sequence of *counts* is `..., 1, 3, 3, 1, 1`. This pattern `(3,3), (1,1)` could suggest the next pattern would be a repeat of `(3,3)`, meaning the next count would be 3.\n5.  **Determine the Next Number**: Based on this analysis, the next group is likely to have a value of `36` and a count of `3`. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is `36`.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this logic, showing the final reasoning as a printed equation-like statement.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_next_number(seq):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the sequence by grouping identical consecutive numbers\n    and extrapolating the pattern to find the next number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Group the sequence and create a list of (value, count) pairs.\n    groups = [(key, len(list(group))) for key, group in itertools.groupby(seq)]\n\n    print(\"Original sequence:\", seq)\n    print(\"Groups of (value, count):\", groups)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze the pattern at the end of the sequence.\n    # The pattern of the last four values is (36, 124, 36, 124).\n    last_four_values = [g[0] for g in groups[-4:]]\n    \n    # The logic is based on pattern continuation.\n    # Pattern: ..., value_A, value_B, value_A, value_B, ...\n    # The next value is predicted to be value_A.\n    predicted_next_value = last_four_values[-2]\n\n    # The final step is to formulate the \"equation\" as requested.\n    # The equation is a statement of the pattern logic.\n    val1 = last_four_values[0]\n    val2 = last_four_values[1]\n    val3 = last_four_values[2]\n    val4 = last_four_values[3]\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the reasoning and the final answer.\n    print(\"The last four unique values in the sequence are {}, {}, {}, {}.\".format(val1, val2, val3, val4))\n    print(\"This reveals an alternating pattern.\")\n    print(\"The equation to find the next number is based on continuing this pattern:\")\n    print(\"{} (value from 2 steps back) -> {} (predicted next value)\".format(val3, predicted_next_value))\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is:\")\n    print(predicted_next_value)\n\n\n# The given sequence\nsequence = [\n    111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, \n    49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n]\n\nfind_next_number(sequence)\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
