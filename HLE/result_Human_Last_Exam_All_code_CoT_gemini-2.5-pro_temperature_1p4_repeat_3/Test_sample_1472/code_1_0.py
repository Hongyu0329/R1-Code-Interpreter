    print("Step 1: Analyzing the molecular structure.")
    print(" - Central Atom: Cu (Copper)")
    print(" - Ligand (L): 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3), which is a bidentate ligand.")
    print(" - Complex: Cu(L)2, with a coordination number of 4.")
    print(" - Plausible Geometries: Tetrahedral or cis-Square Planar.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Step 2: Following the symmetry determination flowchart.")
    print("\nQ1: Is the molecule of high symmetry (e.g., Td, Oh) or linear?")
    print("A1: No. The molecule has complex ligands and is not linear. Proceed.")

    print("\nQ2: Is there a principal rotation axis (Cn)?")
    print("A2: Yes. Whether tetrahedral or cis-square planar, the two identical ligands can be interchanged by a 180-degree rotation. This axis passes through the Cu atom.")
    print("--> A C2 axis exists. This is the principal axis.")

    print("\nQ3: Are there 2 C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C2 axis?")
    print("A3: No. The chelate rings (Cu-S-CH2-CH2-S) are puckered (not flat), and the methyl groups break the symmetry required for perpendicular C2 axes.")
    print("--> The point group is not in the D family.")

    print("\nQ4: Is there a horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h) perpendicular to the C2 axis?")
    print("A4: No. The carbon atoms of the chelate rings and the methyl groups are located out of any potential horizontal plane, breaking this symmetry.")
    print("--> The point group is not in the C_nh family.")

    print("\nQ5: Is there a vertical or dihedral mirror plane (sigma_v/sigma_d) containing the C2 axis?")
    print("A5: No. A mirror plane would have to bisect the puckered ligands. Due to the gauche conformation of the -CH2-CH2- bridge, one side is not the mirror image of the other.")
    print("--> The point group is not in the C_nv family.")

    print("\nQ6: Is there an improper rotation axis (S_2n, i.e., S4) collinear with the C2 axis?")
    print("A6: No. A 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection does not map the molecule onto itself.")
    print("--> A center of inversion (i = S2) is also absent.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Step 3: Conclusion.")
    print("The only symmetry element found (besides the identity element E) is a single C2 rotation axis.")
    print("A group containing only the elements E and C2 is the C2 point group.")
