def solve_fixed_points_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the problem about the smallest possible
    nonzero number of fixed points of the Stone-Cech lift of a continuous function.
    
    The problem is a known result in point-set topology. The smallest possible
    nonzero number of fixed points is 1. This can be achieved, for example, by
    functions like f(x) = ln(e^x + 1), which has a fixed point at +infinity in the
    Stone-Cech remainder, but not at -infinity. Proving uniqueness is advanced.
    
    There is no calculation to be performed. The code directly prints the answer.
