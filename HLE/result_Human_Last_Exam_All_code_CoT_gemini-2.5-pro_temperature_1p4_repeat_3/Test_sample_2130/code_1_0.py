    This function calculates the minimum ratio of (Surface Area)^3 / (Volume)^2
    for the region traversed by particles from an emitter.

    The derivation proceeds as follows:
    1. The region is a segment of a paraboloid of revolution.
       Let h be the emitter height and E = v^2/(2g) be the kinetic energy head.
       The paraboloid has its focus at the emitter.
    2. The volume V is given by V = 2 * pi * E * (h + E)^2.
    3. The total surface area A consists of a flat base and a curved top:
       A_base = 4 * pi * E * (h + E)
       A_lateral = (8*pi*E^2/3) * [((h + 2*E)/E)**1.5 - 1]
       A = A_base + A_lateral
    4. The ratio R = A^3 / V^2 is a function of the dimensionless variable x = E/h.
       R(x) = (16*pi/27) * F(x), where F(x) is the function to be minimized numerically.
