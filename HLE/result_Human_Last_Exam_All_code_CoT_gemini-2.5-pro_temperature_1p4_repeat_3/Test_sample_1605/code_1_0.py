# The problem is a theoretical question from topology.
# Based on the reasoning, the number of homeomorphism classes of compact metric spaces
# with a disconnection number of four is 1. The representative of this class
# is the "theta-4" space (4 arcs connecting two common points).

# The final result is an integer.
number_of_classes = 1

# Print the final answer.
