def solve_poem_swap():
    """
    Analyzes the poem to find two swapped lines.

    The analysis reveals that the sestina's end-word pattern is correct,
    meaning the swapped lines must share the same end-word. The error is
    found by checking for grammatical and logical breaks in the poem's sense.

    Stanza 6, by Klaius, reads:
    31 Long since the happy dwellers of these valleys
    32 Have prayed me leave my strange exclaiming music,
    
    The final lines include Klaius saying:
    74 Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music

    Lines 32 and 74 both end in 'music'. Swapping them fixes a grammatical
    break in Stanza 6, where line 31 is left without a proper verb if line 74
    is present. The swap also improves the logical consistency of the final lines.
