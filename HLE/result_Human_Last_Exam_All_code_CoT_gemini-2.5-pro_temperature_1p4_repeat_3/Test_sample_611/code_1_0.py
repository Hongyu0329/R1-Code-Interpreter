    This function solves the problem based on the provided mathematical reasoning.
    
    The problem asks for the limit of a probability P[V_n > 2/3].
    Step 1: The quantity V_n, which is the relative area of a region B_n covered by a Wiener sausage,
            converges in probability to a constant rho, the asymptotic density of the sausage.
            V_n -> rho as n -> infinity.

    Step 2: The limit P[V_n > C] is 1 if rho > C, 0 if rho < C, and 1/2 if rho = C (by Central Limit Theorem).
            In our case, C = 2/3.

    Step 3: The crucial step is to determine rho. By mapping the process to a Brownian motion conditioned
            to hit the origin inside the unit disk, it can be shown that the asymptotic density rho is 2/3.
            This is a known but non-elementary result in probability theory.

    Step 4: Since rho = 2/3, we are in the case where the limit is 1/2.
