    """
    Solves the geology quiz by providing the consensus/debated status of each statement.

    The statements are evaluated as follows:
    (1) The Morrison formation represents a foredeep deposit. -> C (Consensus)
    (2) Metamorphic core complexes formed in response to a slab window. -> D (Debated)
    (3) An orogenic plateau ("Nevadaplano") existed in present-day Nevada by the end of the Cretaceous. -> C (Consensus)
    (4) An orogenic plateau in the Arizona portion of the Cordillera ("Arizonaplano") was constructed via magmatic thickening... -> D (Debated)
    (5) Laramide-style structures are generally inboard of Sevier-style structures. -> C (Consensus)
    (6) The Sierra Nevada batholith and Idaho Batholith were formed by the ancestral Cordilleran arc. -> C (Consensus)
    (7) A series of large-magnitude ignimbrite eruptions began in Idaho and Montana in the Eocene and propagated generally to the southwest. -> C (Consensus)
    (8) The Colorado Plateau reached modern elevations by the late Cretaceous... -> D (Debated)
    (9) The Cascades arc reached modern elevation by the late Oligocene... -> D (Debated)
    (10) Laramide-style deformation was caused by subduction of the Shatsky conjugate. -> D (Debated)
