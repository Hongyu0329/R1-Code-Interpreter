Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Understanding the Definitions**
    *   **Continuum**: A compact, connected metric space (e.g., a closed interval, a disk, a sphere).
    *   **Decomposable Continuum**: A continuum `X` that can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, `X = A U B`, where `A != X` and `B != X`.
    *   **Proper Subcontinuum**: A subset of `X` that is a continuum but is not equal to `X`.
    *   **Regular Subcontinuum**: A subcontinuum `S` that is equal to the closure of its interior, i.e., `S = cl(int(S))`.

2.  **Establishing a Lower Bound (The cardinality is at least 2)**
    Let `X` be a nondegenerate decomposable continuum, so `X = A U B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua.

    *   First, we must show that `A` has a non-empty interior in `X`. Assume, for contradiction, that `int(A)` is empty. The boundary of `A`, `bd(A)`, is `cl(A) \\ int(A) = A \\ {} = A`. A set with an empty interior is a boundary set. This means `X = cl(X \\ A)`. Since `X = A U B`, `X \\ A = B \\ A`. So, `X = cl(B \\ A)`. As `B` is a closed set, `cl(B \\ A)` is a subset of `B`. This implies `X` is a subset of `B`, so `X = B`. This contradicts the fact that `B` is a *proper* subcontinuum. Therefore, `int(A)` must be non-empty.
    *   A symmetric argument shows that `int(B)` is also non-empty.
    *   Let `U` be any connected component of `int(A)`. The closure, `S_A = cl(U)`, is a subcontinuum of `X`. It can be shown that such a set `S_A` is regular. Since `S_A` is contained in `A`, it is a proper subcontinuum.
    *   Similarly, we can find a regular proper subcontinuum `S_B` contained in `B`.
    *   These two subcontinua, `S_A` and `S_B`, must be distinct. We can choose a component `U` of `int(A)` that contains points from `A \\ B`. Then `S_A = cl(U)` contains points not in `B`. Likewise, we can find `S_B` containing points not in `A`. Since `S_A` is not a subset of `B` and `S_B` is not a subset of `A`, they must be different.
    *   Therefore, any such continuum `X` must have at least two regular proper subcontinua.

3.  **Constructing an Example with Exactly 2 Regular Proper Subcontinua**
    To show that 2 is the smallest possible number, we need to construct an example.

    *   Let `K_1` and `K_2` be two *indecomposable* continua. An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be decomposed. A key property is that any proper subcontinuum of an indecomposable continuum has an empty interior within that space. A standard example is the Knaster continuum (buckethandle).
    *   Construct `X` by taking the wedge sum of `K_1` and `K_2`, which means gluing them together at a single point, `p`. Let the image of `K_1` in `X` be `A` and the image of `K_2` be `B`.
    *   `X = A U B` is a decomposable continuum.
    *   The subcontinuum `A` is regular in `X`. Its interior in `X` is `A \\ {p}`, and the closure of `A \\ {p}` in `X` is `A`. So `A = cl(int(A))`.
    *   Similarly, `B` is a regular subcontinuum of `X`.
    *   Now, we must show there are no others. Let `C` be any other proper subcontinuum of `X`.
        - If `C` is a proper subcontinuum of `A`, its interior in `A` is empty (by indecomposability). This can be used to show its interior in `X` is also empty, so `C` is not regular.
        - The same holds if `C` is a proper subcontinuum of `B`.
        - If `C` contains parts of both `A` and `B`, a similar argument shows that `int(C)` is empty.
    *   Thus, this constructed space `X` has exactly two regular proper subcontinua: `A` and `B`.

4.  **Conclusion**
    Since the number of regular proper subcontinua must be at least 2, and we have constructed an example with exactly 2, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
