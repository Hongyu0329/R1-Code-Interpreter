    "To find the separatrix of the system, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the System**: I'll start by examining the given system of differential equations and identifying its properties.\n2.  **Find Equilibrium Points**: I will locate the equilibrium points (where `d'` and `u'` are both zero) as they are crucial for understanding the phase portrait. The behavior of trajectories near these points determines the overall dynamics.\n3.  **Identify Saddle Points**: Separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. I will classify the equilibrium points by analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system at each point to find which one is a saddle.\n4.  **Determine the Separatrix Equation**: After identifying the saddle point, I will look for the equation of a trajectory that either approaches or emanates from it. In many cases, these special trajectories (separatrices) have a relatively simple algebraic form. I will test a candidate equation by substituting it back into the system of differential equations.\n5.  **Code for Verification and Output**: I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to symbolically verify that the discovered equation is indeed a valid trajectory (and thus a separatrix). The script will also clearly print the steps of the verification and the final equation of the separatrix, formatted as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the process of finding and verifying the separatrix\n    for the given system of differential equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
