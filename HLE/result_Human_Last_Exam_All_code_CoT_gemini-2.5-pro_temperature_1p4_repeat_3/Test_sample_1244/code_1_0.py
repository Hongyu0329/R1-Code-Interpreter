    # --- Reasoning for (a) and (b) ---
    
    # (a) Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?
    # An even lattice cannot be isometric to the standard integer lattice Z^12, which is odd.
    # Therefore, its farness must be greater than 1.
    # A theorem by R. T. Bodd states that an even unimodular lattice of dimension n
    # which is a 2-neighbor of Z^n exists if and only if n is not congruent to 0, 1, or -1 (mod 8).
    # Since 12 mod 8 = 4, such a lattice exists.
    # If a 2-neighbor exists, the farness is at most 2. Since farness > 1, it must be exactly 2.
    # So, the answer is Yes.
    
    # (b) Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3.
    # Can L have a vector x such that x.x = 0 (mod 6) and x is a 3-primitive vector?
    # The condition far(L) = 3 means L is isometric to a lattice L' where 3*Z^14 is a sublattice of L'.
    # Let's consider the vector x' = (3, 3, 0, ..., 0). This vector is in 3*Z^14, so it's in L'.
    # The squared norm is x'.x' = 3^2 + 3^2 = 18, which is divisible by 6.
    # For x' to be 3-primitive, the vector x'/3 = (1, 1, 0, ..., 0) must NOT be in L'.
    # While some lattices may contain this vector (which has norm 2), it is not a requirement for
    # all odd unimodular lattices of rank 14 with farness 3. It's possible to have such a lattice L'
    # that does not contain the vector (1, 1, 0, ..., 0).
    # Thus, such a vector x can exist. The answer is yes.
    
    # --- Verification for (c) ---
    
    # (c) If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24,
    # what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?
    # The lattice L is the Niemeier lattice N_D24, which is D_24^+.
    # D_24^+ contains the lattice D_24 = {x in Z^24 | sum of components of x is even}.
    # The question asks for the smallest integer d >= 1 such that L contains a sublattice
    # isometric to d*Z^24. This is equivalent to finding 24 mutually orthogonal vectors in L
    # that all have the same squared norm N = d^2.
