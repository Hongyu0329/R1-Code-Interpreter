    # of the total number of a certain hat type.
    # To maximize the guaranteed number of correct guesses (the minimum outcome),
    # the teams must be as close in size as possible.
    # For 9 people, the sizes are 4 and 5. The minimum is 4.

    # This allows the remaining 8 people to deduce their own hat color with certainty.
