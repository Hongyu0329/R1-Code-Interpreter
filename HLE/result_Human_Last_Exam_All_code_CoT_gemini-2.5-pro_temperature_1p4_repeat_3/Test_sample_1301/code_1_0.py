def generate_molecule_smiles():
    """
    This function generates and prints the SMILES string for a molecule
    that satisfies all the complex user-defined constraints.

    The molecule is designed based on the following logic:
    1.  Formula Derivation: From the constraints (MW, atom counts), the formula is C12H18O6.
    2.  Skeleton Design: A 17-atom skeleton (12C, 5O-ether) is needed to accommodate the exocyclic carbonyl oxygen.
        A spiro[bicyclo[5.5.0]dodecane, 6-membered-heterocycle] skeleton is chosen. It has 17 atoms (12+6-1), is tricyclic,
        contains a bicyclic component, and has no rotatable bonds.
    3.  Atom Placement:
        - The spiro ring is a 6-membered heterocycle containing a ketone and two ethers: -O-C-C(=O)-C-O-C-.
        - The bicyclo[5.5.0]dodecane part contains the remaining 3 ether oxygens.
    4.  SMILES Construction: The final SMILES string is constructed by representing the bicyclo[5.5.0] core,
        attaching the spiro ring at a bridgehead carbon, and placing the heteroatoms.
    """

    # SMILES for the bicyclo[5.5.0]dodecane core is C1CCCCC2CCCCC12
    # The spiro center will be the bridgehead carbon C1.
    # The spiro-fused ring is 6-membered: 4 carbons (one is C=O) and 2 ether oxygens.
    # A valid, non-ester ring is C-O-C-C(=O)-C-O-. Its SMILES as a spiro branch is (OCC(=O)OC1).
    # The remaining 3 ether oxygens are placed in the bicyclo part.
