    "For the given integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$, we want to find an approximation for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** Let $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.0} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)} dx$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand becomes very large where $f(x)$ is small. On the integration interval $[0, 15.0]$, the minimum of $f(x)$ occurs at $x=0$, where $f(0)=0$. Therefore, the dominant contribution to the integral comes from a small neighborhood around $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the function `f(x)`:** For small values of $x$, the function $f(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$. In this case, the dominant term is $9.0 x^{5.0}$. So, we have $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for $x \\to 0$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the integral:** We can replace $f(x)$ with its approximation. Also, because the integrand's value is concentrated near $x=0$ and decays rapidly for larger $x$, we can extend the upper integration limit from $15.0$ to $\\infty$ without introducing significant error for small $\\epsilon$.\n    $$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the approximate integral:** This integral can be solved analytically using a substitution. Let's use the general form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + c x^k} dx$, with $c=9.0$ and $k=5.0$.\n    We perform the change of variables $u = (c/\\epsilon)^{1/k} x$. This implies $x = (\\epsilon/c)^{1/k} u$ and $dx = (\\epsilon/c)^{1/k} du$.\n    Substituting these into the integral gives:\n    $$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + c ((\\epsilon/c)^{1/k} u)^k} (\\epsilon/c)^{1/k} du = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^k} (\\epsilon/c)^{1/k} du$$\n    $$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} (\\frac{\\epsilon}{c})^{1/k} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^k} du = c^{-1/k} \\epsilon^{(1-k)/k} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^k} du$$\n\n5.  **Use a standard integral formula:** The remaining integral is a known result related to the Gamma or Beta function: $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^k} du = \\frac{\\pi/k}{\\sin(\\pi/k)}$.\n\n6.  **Final Formula:** Combining the results, we get the analytical approximation:\n    $$I(\\epsilon) \\approx c^{-1/k} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/k}{\\sin(\\pi/k)} \\right) \\epsilon^{(1-k)/k}$$\n    Substituting $c=9.0$ and $k=5.0$:\n    $$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9.0^{-1/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right) \\epsilon^{-4/5}$$\n    This can be written as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^p$. The following Python code calculates the numerical values for the coefficient $C$ and the exponent $p$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the constants for the analytical approximation of the integral I(epsilon).\n    The approximation has the form I(epsilon) approx C * epsilon^p.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # From the analysis, the dominant term in the denominator for small x is 9.0 * x^5.0.\n    # We denote this as c * x^k.\n    c = 9.0\n    k = 5.0\n\n    # The exponent p is given by the formula (1-k)/k.\n    p = (1.0 - k) / k\n\n    # The coefficient C is given by the formula c^(-1/k) * integral(1/(1+u^k)du).\n    # The value of the integral is (pi/k) / sin(pi/k).\n    integral_part = (math.pi / k) / math.sin(math.pi / k)\n    C = math.pow(c, -1.0/k) * integral_part\n\n    # Print the derived formula and the calculated numerical values.\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon^p\")\n    print(f\"\\nBased on the leading term {c}*x^{k}, the constants are derived as:\")\n    print(f\"p = (1 - {k}) / {k}\")\n    print(f\"C = {c}^(-1/{k}) * (pi/{k}) / sin(pi/{k})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nNumerically, these values are:\")\n    print(f\"p = {p}\")\n    print(f\"C = {C}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThus, the final approximate formula is:\")\n    # The final equation with all numbers included, as requested.\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ≈ {C} * epsilon^({p})\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) approx 9.0**(-1.0/5.0) * (pi/5.0) / sin(pi/5.0) * epsilon**(-4.0/5.0)>>>"
