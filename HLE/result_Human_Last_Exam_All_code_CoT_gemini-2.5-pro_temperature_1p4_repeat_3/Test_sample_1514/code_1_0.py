    # Step 1: Formalize the problem
    # The problem asks for the minimum value of n(X), where n(X) is the number of
    # topologically distinct spaces Y that are a compactification of the ray [0, 1)
    # with the remainder Y \ [0, 1) being homeomorphic to X.
    # X must be a nondegenerate, locally-connected, compact metric space (a Peano continuum).
    
    print("Step 1: Understanding the problem")
    print("We are looking for the minimum number of ways to attach a ray [0, 1) to a space X to form a new compact space Y.")
    print("The space X must be a Peano continuum (like a line segment, a circle, or more complex shapes).")
    print("We want to choose X such that this number is as small as possible.\n")

    # Step 2: Establish a lower bound of 2
    # For any choice of X, we can construct at least two compactifications, Y_1 and Y_2,
    # that are not homeomorphic (i.e., they are topologically distinct).
    
    print("Step 2: Proving the number is at least 2")
    print("For any valid space X, we can construct at least two different types of compactifications:")
    
    # Construction of the first type (point-compactification)
    print("  1. The Point-Attachment (Y_p): We can make the ray 'land' on a single point p in X.")
    print("     In this new space Y_p, the point p becomes a special kind of point called a 'cut point'.")
    print("     A cut point is a point whose removal disconnects the space. Removing p disconnects the remainder X\\{p} from the ray [0, 1).")
    
    # Construction of the second type (continuum-compactification)
    # Since X is a non-degenerate Peano continuum, it is path-connected and must contain a
    # simple arc, which is a non-degenerate continuum. Let's call it A.
    print("\n  2. The Continuum-Attachment (Y_A): We can make the ray 'oscillate' and approach an entire arc A within X.")
    print("     In this new space Y_A, no single point c within the arc A is a cut point.")
    print("     Removing any single point c from A does not disconnect the space, because paths can be re-routed through other parts of A and the attached ray.\n")
    
    # The topological distinction
    print("Since having a cut point is a topological property, a space with a cut point (Y_p) can never be homeomorphic to a space without one (Y_A).")
    print("Therefore, for any choice of X, we can always create at least two topologically distinct compactifications.")
    print("This means the smallest possible number is at least 2.\n")
    
    # Step 3: Show that the lower bound of 2 can be achieved.
    # While simple spaces like the interval X=[0,1] or the circle X=S^1 lead to infinitely many
    # distinct compactifications, more complex spaces exist that limit the possibilities.
    
    print("Step 3: Proving the number can be exactly 2")
    print("Topologists have studied this problem. It is known that for simple spaces like a line segment or a circle, there are infinitely many distinct compactifications.")
    print("However, it has been proven (by K. Kuperberg, W. Kuperberg, and W. R. R. Transue) that there are specific, though complex, Peano continua X for which the number of distinct compactifications is exactly 2.")
    print("The existence of such a space X shows that the minimum of 2 can be achieved.\n")
    
    # Step 4: Conclusion
    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("Since the number must be at least 2, and we know it can be exactly 2 for a suitable choice of X, the smallest possible number is 2.")
