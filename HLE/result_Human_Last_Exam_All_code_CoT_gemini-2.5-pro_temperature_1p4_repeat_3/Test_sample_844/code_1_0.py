    # A. CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.
    print("A: This is TRUE. The CA biotype's ability to thrive on a raffinose-rich diet, unlike the MA biotype, directly implies a superior ability to metabolize RFOs.")

    # B. CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
    print("B: This is TRUE. The text states they 'did well' on these respective diets, which indicates an adaptation or preference.")

    # C. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.
    print("C: This is TRUE. CA moves from high-raffinose watermelon to low-raffinose cotton. It is a common biological principle (substrate-dependent regulation) that enzyme activity (galactosidase) decreases when its substrate (raffinose) is less available.")

    # D. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.
    print("D: This is NOT TRUE. While galactosidase activity likely decreases (as stated in C), the reason provided is incorrect. The text provides no information about glucose levels in cotton. The most direct cause for a change in galactosidase activity is the change in the level of its specific substrate, raffinose, not glucose.")

    # E. Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.
    print("E: This is TRUE. MA moves from low-raffinose cotton to high-raffinose watermelon. The presence of a new, abundant substrate (raffinose) would likely induce increased activity of the corresponding enzyme (galactosidase) for metabolism.")
