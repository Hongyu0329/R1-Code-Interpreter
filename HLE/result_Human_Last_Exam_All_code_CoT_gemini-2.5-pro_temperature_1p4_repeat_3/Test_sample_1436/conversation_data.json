    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to calculate the symmetry factor for the described Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagram's Structure**: The problem describes a Feynman diagram with 2 vertices and 4 field contractions (which act as propagators) connecting them. This topology corresponds to a vacuum diagram in a theory with a four-field interaction, such as $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Symmetry Factor**: The symmetry factor, denoted as 'S', for a Feynman diagram counts the number of ways its internal components (vertices and propagators) can be interchanged without altering the diagram's overall connectivity.\n\n3.  **Calculate Vertex Symmetry**: The diagram has 2 vertices that are structurally identicalâ€”they are both endpoints for the same four propagators. Therefore, these two vertices can be swapped, contributing a factor of $2!$ to the total symmetry.\n\n4.  **Calculate Propagator Symmetry**: There are 4 identical propagators connecting the two vertices. These can be permuted among themselves in any order without changing the diagram. This contributes a factor of $4!$ to the total symmetry.\n\n5.  **Compute the Total Symmetry Factor**: The total symmetry factor 'S' is the product of the symmetries from the vertices and the propagators.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will use the `math.factorial` function, multiply the results, and print a clear explanation of the calculation, showing each number in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_feynman_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of interchangeable vertices\n    num_vertices = 2\n    # Number of identical propagators connecting the vertices\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # The symmetry factor from permuting identical vertices is n!\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # The symmetry factor from permuting identical propagators is m!\n    propagator_symmetry = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of the individual factors\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * propagator_symmetry\n\n    # Print the explanation and step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factor (S) for a Feynman diagram with 2 vertices and 4 propagators:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    print(f\"1.
