    "In a surface code, each hole (or inner boundary) introduced into a patch can be used to encode one logical qubit. The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from all independent patches.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the number of patches, which is 2.\n2.  Define the number of holes in each patch, which is also 2.\n3.  Calculate the number of logical qubits per patch. This is equal to the number of holes.\n4.  Calculate the total number of logical qubits by multiplying the number of patches by the logical qubits per patch.\n5.  Print the full calculation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubit_calculation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given surface code configuration.\n    \n    The number of logical qubits in a single patch of surface code is equal to the number of holes.\n    For multiple, independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits\n    from each patch.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the parameters of the problem\n    num_patches = 2\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n    \n    # Calculate logical qubits per patch\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of logical qubits\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(\"The total number of logical qubits is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Total Qubits = (Number of Patches) * (Number of Holes per Patch)\")\n    print(f\"Total Qubits = {num_patches} * {num_holes_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_qubit_calculation()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
