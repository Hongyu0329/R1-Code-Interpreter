    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the number sequence puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms** in the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119. I'll check for a pattern based on multiplication and addition, like `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k`.\n2.  **Determine the value of `k`** for each step:\n    *   From 11 to 23: `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`. So, `k=1`.\n    *   From 23 to 51: `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`. So, `k=5`.\n    *   From 51 to 119: `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`. So, `k=17`.\n3.  **Identify the pattern in the sequence of `k`**: The sequence for `k` is 1, 5, 17.\n4.  **Analyze the differences** in the `k` sequence:\n    *   `5 - 1 = 4`\n    *   `17 - 5 = 12`\n    *   The differences are 4, 12. This is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 (since `12 = 4 * 3`).\n5.  **Predict the next terms**:\n    *   The next difference in the `k` sequence will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   The next value of `k` will be `17 + 36 = 53`.\n6.  **Calculate the final term** in the original sequence using the pattern found: `Next Term = 2 * (last term) + (next k)`.\n    *   `Next Term = 2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying the underlying pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence starts with 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n    # The pattern, starting from the second term, is x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k_n\n    # Let's find the sequence of k.\n    # k1 = 23 - (2 * 11) = 1\n    # k2 = 51 - (2 * 23) = 5\n    # k3 = 119 - (2 * 51) = 17\n    k_sequence = [1, 5, 17]\n\n    # Now, let's find the pattern in the k_sequence.\n    # The differences are: 5 - 1 = 4, 17 - 5 = 12.\n    # The differences [4, 12] form a geometric progression with a ratio of 3.\n    last_k_diff = 12\n    ratio = 3\n    next_k_diff = last_k_diff * ratio\n\n    # The next k is the last k plus the next difference.\n    last_k = 17\n    next_k = last_k + next_k_diff\n\n    # The last term of the original sequence is 119.\n    last_term = 119\n    next_term = 2 * last_term + next_k\n\n    # Print the final equation with all its components.\n    print(f\"The pattern is that each number is twice the previous number plus a value 'k'.\")\n    print(f\"The sequence of 'k' is 1, 5, 17, ...\")\n    print(f\"The differences in 'k' are 4, 12, ... which shows a multiplicative factor of 3.\")\n    print(f\"The next difference in 'k' is {last_k_diff} * {ratio} = {next_k_diff}.\")\n    print(f\"The next 'k' is {last_k} + {next_k_diff} = {next_k}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{last_term} * 2 + {next_k} = {next_term}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
