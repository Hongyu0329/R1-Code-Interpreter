    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to analyze the symmetries imposed by the Kähler structure.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **General Riemann Tensor**: On a generic $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Riemann tensor $R_{ijkl}$ has symmetries that reduce the number of its independent components to $\\frac{d^2(d^2-1)}{12}$.\n\n2.  **Kähler Manifold Properties**: A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric. If its complex dimension is $n$, its real dimension is $d=2n$. This special structure introduces additional symmetries.\n\n3.  **Symmetries in Complex Coordinates**: In local complex coordinates $(z^1, ..., z^n)$, the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor are of the form $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$. These components have the following key symmetries:\n    *   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}}$ (Pair symmetry)\n    *   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}}$ (A consequence of the first Bianchi identity on a Kähler manifold)\n\n4.  **Counting the Components**:\n    *   These symmetries imply that the tensor is symmetric in its holomorphic indices $(\\alpha, \\gamma)$ and also in its anti-holomorphic indices $(\\bar{\\beta}, \\bar{\\delta})$.\n    *   We can therefore think of the tensor as being determined by a matrix whose rows are indexed by the symmetric pair $(\\alpha, \\gamma)$ and columns by the symmetric pair $(\\beta, \\delta)$.\n    *   The number of ways to choose a symmetric pair of indices from a set of $n$ elements is $N = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n    *   The reality of the Riemann tensor implies that this $N \\times N$ matrix is Hermitian.\n    *   An $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix is defined by $N^2$ independent real numbers ($N$ real diagonal elements and $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ complex off-diagonal elements).\n\n5.  **Final Formula**: Substituting the expression for $N$, we find that the number of independent real components is:\n    Number of components = $N^2 = \\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$.\n\nThe Python code below implements this formula, taking the complex dimension `n` as input and showing the steps of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_riemann_components_kahler():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of independent components of the Riemann\n    tensor on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Prompt the user for the complex dimension n\n        n_str = input(\"Enter the complex dimension 'n' of the Kähler manifold: \")\n        n = int(n_str)\n        if n < 0:\n            print(\"Dimension cannot be negative.\", file=sys.stderr)\n            return\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input.
