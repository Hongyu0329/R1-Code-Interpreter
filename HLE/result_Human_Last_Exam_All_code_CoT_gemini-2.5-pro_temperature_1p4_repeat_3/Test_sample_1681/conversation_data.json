    "In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the dominant strategy for both players is to \"Defect,\" leading to a Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect) with a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1). However, by introducing quantum mechanics, specifically entanglement and quantum strategies, the game's structure changes.\n\nHere is my plan to find the equilibrium in the quantum version of the game:\n1.  I will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, a standard framework for quantum games.\n2.  I will set the initial state of the players' qubits to be maximally entangled. This is the crucial step that allows for a new type of equilibrium.\n3.  In this quantum game, players can choose from a wider range of strategies than just \"Cooperate\" or \"Defect.\" A new, purely quantum strategy, often denoted as `Q`, becomes available.\n4.  I will demonstrate that when both players choose this quantum strategy `Q`, it forms a new Nash Equilibrium.\n5.  I will write a Python script to simulate this `(Q, Q)` strategy pair. The script will calculate the final probabilities of the classical outcomes (Cooperate, Cooperate), (Cooperate, Defect), etc.\n6.  Finally, using these probabilities and the provided payoff matrix, the script will calculate the expected payoff for each player at this new equilibrium point. The code will print out each step of the final payoff calculation.\n\nThe script below will show that this new quantum equilibrium results in the payoff (5, 5), effectively resolving the dilemma by making mutual cooperation the stable and optimal strategy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol with maximal entanglement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
