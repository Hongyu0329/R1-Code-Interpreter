    "My plan is to solve this problem by first calculating the uncertainty in the electron's momentum and then calculating its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$):** I will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. For the minimum uncertainty, the equation is $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $\\Delta x$ is the given uncertainty in position (10 pm, which I will convert to meters).\n\n2.  **Calculate the momentum in the first Bohr orbit ($p_1$):** According to the Bohr model, the momentum of an electron in the n-th orbit is $p_n = \\frac{n \\hbar}{r_n}$, where $r_n$ is the radius of the orbit. For the first orbit (n=1), the radius $r_1$ is equal to the Bohr radius, $a_0$. Therefore, the momentum is $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio:** Finally, I will compute the required ratio, which is $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1}$.\n\nI will use Python with the `scipy.constants` library to get precise values for the physical constants involved. The code will print out the intermediate values and the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given uncertainty in position in picometers\n    delta_x_pm = 10.0\n\n    # Convert picometers to meters\n    delta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12\n\n    # Physical constants from scipy\n    hbar = scipy.constants.hbar  # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\n    a0 = scipy.constants.physical_constants['Bohr radius'][0]  # Bohr radius in m\n\n    # 1.
