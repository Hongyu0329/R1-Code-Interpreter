# Step 1: Define the optimal values based on the mathematical derivation.
# The maximum of |b|+|c| is found when b = 2/sqrt(5) and c = (1 + 1/sqrt(5))/2.
# We are calculating b+c for these values.
sqrt_5 = math.sqrt(5)

# Step 2: Calculate the optimal values for |b| and |c|.
# As per the derivation, we can analyze the case where b>=0 and c>=0.
b_optimal = 2 / sqrt_5

# Step 3: Calculate the maximum value of |b| + |c|.
max_value = b_optimal + c_optimal

# Step 4: Print the results, showing each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is b_optimal + c_optimal = max_value
