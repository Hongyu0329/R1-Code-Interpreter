    print(f"   - In mice lacking the 'xy' gene (-xyL), removing both A and B (ΔAΔB) has no effect on the bacterial count ({data['xyL_wt_pathogen']} vs {data['xyL_dAdB_pathogen']}).")

    print("     This strongly implies that the combined action of virulence factors A and B is to deactivate or inhibit the protective effect of the host's 'xy' gene product.\n")

    print("C. Virulence factor A and virulence factor C deactivate the product of gene xy. Virulence factor C does not influence the infection process.")

    print("D. Virulence factor A and virulence factor B deactivate the product of gene xy, and virulence factor C targets the same host proteins as virulence factor B.")
    print("   - Incorrect. While the first part is true, the second is not. B targets the 'xy' pathway, while C targets a different pathway.\n")
