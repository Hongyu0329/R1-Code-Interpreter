    # The problem describes a type theory with a non-standard, powerful recursion principle.
    # The subterm rule is key: "a lambda (Î» x. f) is a subterm of X...".
    # This means `lambda x: f(x)` is considered "smaller" than any term `X`.
    
    # This rule makes recursion sensitive to the syntactic form of a term (if it's a lambda or not).
    # This is an "intensional" view of functions, where the definition matters.
    
    # We must find an axiom that conflicts with this intensional viewpoint.
    # Functional Extensionality is the prime candidate.
    
    # Functional Extensionality: If `f(x) = g(x)` for all `x`, then `f = g`.
    # This axiom enforces an "extensional" view of functions, where only the input/output behavior matters.
    
    # The Conflict:
    # 1. Let `f` be a function. Let `g` be its eta-expansion, e.g., `g = lambda x: f(x)`.
    # 2. Syntactically, `g` is a lambda, but `f` might be a variable. They look different.
    # 3. The recursion principle can distinguish them. A recursive function `rec` could potentially be defined such that `rec(f)` and `rec(g)` are different.
    # 4. Semantically, `f` and `g` are identical in behavior. Functional Extensionality forces the equality `f = g`.
    # 5. If `f = g`, it must be that `rec(f) = rec(g)`. This creates a contradiction with a `rec` that was defined to distinguish them.
    
    # Therefore, adding Functional Extensionality to this specific system leads to an inconsistency.
