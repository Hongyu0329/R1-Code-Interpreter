    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting R, G, or B values fall outside the range of [0, 1], the color is considered \"out of gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the `colour-science` library in Python, which is the industry standard for accurate color space conversions. It correctly handles the complex math involving different gamma curves and chromatic adaptation between the color spaces' white points.\n2.  I will iterate through each of the five given ROMM RGB colors.\n3.  For each color, I will use the `colour.RGB_to_RGB` function to convert it. This function returns the ideal sRGB values, which may be below 0 or above 1 for out-of-gamut colors.\n4.  I will check if any component of the converted sRGB value is less than 0 or greater than 1.\n5.  I will collect the numbers of the colors that fail this check.\n6.  Finally, I will print the numbers of the out-of-gamut colors in ascending order.\n\n```python\n# The user may need to install the required library first.\n# In your shell, run: pip install colour-science\nimport numpy as np\n\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the 'colour-science' library.\")\n    print(\"Please install it by running: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef find_out_of_gamut_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the ROMM RGB colors from the problem statement\n    # The keys (1-5) correspond to the question numbers\n    romm_colors = {\n        1: np.array([0., 0., 1.]),\n        2: np.array([0., 1., 0.]),\n        3: np.array([0., 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1., 1., 1.])\n    }\n\n    # Define the input and output color spaces using the library\n    romm_cs = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_PROPHOTO_RGB\n    srgb_cs = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_sRGB\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"--- Checking for Out-of-Gamut Colors ---\")\n    print(f\"{'ID':<4}{'ROMM RGB':<18}{'Converted sRGB':<30}{'In sRGB Gamut?'}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Iterate through each color, perform conversion, and check the gamut\n    for i, romm_val in romm_colors.items():\n        # Convert from ROMM RGB to sRGB.\n        # The library returns the unclipped values, which is what we need.\n        srgb_val = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_val, romm_cs, srgb_cs)\n\n        # Check if any value is outside the [0, 1] range.\n        # We use a small tolerance for floating point inaccuracies near 0 and 1.\n        tolerance = 1e-9\n        is_out_of_gamut = np.any((srgb_val < 0 - tolerance) | (srgb_val > 1 + tolerance))\n\n        # Prepare strings for printing\n        romm_str = f\"RGB({romm_val[0]}, {romm_val[1]}, {romm_val[2]})\"\n        srgb_str = f\"RGB({srgb_val[0]:.4f}, {srgb_val[1]:.4f}, {srgb_val[2]:.4f})\"\n        gamut_status = \"No (Out of Gamut)\" if is_out_of_gamut else \"Yes\"\n\n        print(f\"{i:<4}{romm_str:<18}{srgb_str:<30}{gamut_status}\")\n\n        if is_out_of_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(str(i))\n\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Format the final result\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        # Sort the indices in ascending order\n        out_of_gamut_indices.sort(key=int)\n        final_answer = \", \".join(out_of_gamut_indices)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are: {final_answer}\")\n    return final_answer\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    result = find_out_of_gamut_colors()\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{result}>>>\")\n```"
