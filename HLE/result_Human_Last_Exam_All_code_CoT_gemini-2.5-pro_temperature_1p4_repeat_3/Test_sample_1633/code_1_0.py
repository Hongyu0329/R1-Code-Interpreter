    print("   - A Watts-Strogatz small-world network achieves L ~ log(n) by adding a number of 'shortcut' edges proportional to n (specifically, β|E| shortcuts, where |E| is Θ(n)) that are placed uniformly at random.")
    print("   - An ultra-small-world network with L ~ log(log(n)) requires a more efficient, non-uniform global structure. The shortcuts cannot be random; they must be strategically placed, for example, in a hierarchical manner or to form a 'rich-club' core.")

    # Step 2: Determine the order of magnitude for m(n).
    print("\n2. This fundamental change in the scaling law of the average path length implies a global restructuring of the graph's edges.")

    print("     Removing lattice edges is the primary way to destroy this clustering.")
    print("     An optimal strategy would therefore seek to *minimize* the removal of lattice edges, likely by repurposing the existing non-lattice 'shortcut' edges first.")
