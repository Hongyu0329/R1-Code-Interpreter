    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish an upper bound for the chromatic number of the graph \\(G\\). This is done by finding the maximum possible degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\), of any vertex in \\(G\\) and using the well-known inequality \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\). The graph \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles, and each cycle contributes 2 to the degree of a vertex.\n2.  Next, I will demonstrate that this upper bound is achievable. I will show that for a specific \\( n \\), it's possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) that is a complete graph and whose chromatic number is equal to this upper bound.\n3.  Finally, by showing that the chromatic number is at most a certain value and that this value can be achieved, I can conclude the maximal chromatic number. The Python code below will walk through this reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_graph_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the derivation of the maximal chromatic number for a graph\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem and find the maximum degree Δ(G).\n    # The graph G is the union of three cycles (C_n) on the same n vertices.\n    # The degree of a vertex in a single cycle is 2.\n    # The maximum possible degree of a vertex in G, Δ(G), occurs if the cycles are edge-disjoint.\n    degree_per_cycle = 2\n    num_cycles = 3\n    max_possible_degree = degree_per_cycle * num_cycles\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the maximum possible degree Δ(G).\")\n    print(f\"A graph G is the sum of {num_cycles} cycles of length n.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of a vertex in one cycle is {degree_per_cycle}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum degree Δ(G) is therefore at most the sum of the degrees from each cycle.\")\n    print(f\"Δ(G) <= {degree_per_cycle} + {degree_per_cycle} + {degree_per_cycle} = {max_possible_degree}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the upper bound for the chromatic number χ(G).\n    # A general bound for the chromatic number is χ(G) <= Δ(G) + 1.\n    chromatic_upper_bound = max_possible_degree + 1\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the chromatic number χ(G).\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number is bounded by the maximum degree: χ(G) <= Δ(G) + 1.\")\n    print(f\"Applying this bound, we find: χ(G) <= {max_possible_degree} + 1 = {chromatic_upper_bound}\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the maximal chromatic number is no greater than {chromatic_upper_bound}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Show that this upper bound is achievable.\n    # We can do this by constructing a graph G that is the complete graph K_7.\n    # The chromatic number of K_7 is 7.\n    n_for_construction = 7\n    k = (n_for_construction - 1) // 2\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Show that the upper bound is achievable.\")\n    print(f\"We need to show that a chromatic number of {chromatic_upper_bound} is possible for some n.\")\n    print(f\"Consider the case where G is the complete graph K_{chromatic_upper_bound}, which is K_7.\")\n    print(f\"To form a K_7, we must set n = {n_for_construction}.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of every vertex in K_7 is {n_for_construction - 1}, which is {max_possible_degree}.
