    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms. This is a problem of systematically enumerating all possible structures while accounting for equivalences (isomorphisms).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Fixed Structure:** A category with two objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have an identity morphism for each object. These are `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. This accounts for 2 of the 4 total morphisms.\n2.  **Distribute Remaining Morphisms:** The two remaining non-identity morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`, must be distributed among the four possible `hom-sets`: `hom(A,A)`, `hom(A,B)`, `hom(B,A)`, and `hom(B,B)`.\n3.  **Case Analysis:** We can break down the problem into cases based on where `f` and `g` are placed.\n    *   `f` and `g` are both in `hom(A,A)`.\n    *   `f` and `g` are both in `hom(A,B)`.\n    *   `f` is in `hom(A,A)` and `g` is in `hom(A,B)`.\n    *   `f` is in `hom(A,A)` and `g` is in `hom(B,B)`.\n    *   `f` is in `hom(A,B)` and `g` is in `hom(B,A)`.\n4.  **Impose Category Axioms:** For each case, we determine how many valid composition structures exist that satisfy the category axioms (associativity and identity). This often reduces to counting known algebraic structures, like monoids.\n5.  **Account for Isomorphisms:** We must check for isomorphisms between the categories constructed. For example, a structure with morphisms concentrated on object `A` is isomorphic to one with the same structure on object `B` by simply relabeling the objects.\n6.  **Sum the Results:** The total count is the sum of the non-isomorphic categories found in each case.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan by calculating the number of categories for each case and summing the results.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n    The logic proceeds with a case analysis based on the distribution of the two\n    non-identity morphisms, after accounting for the two mandatory identity morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Finding the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\\n\")\n    print(\"Let the objects be A and B.
