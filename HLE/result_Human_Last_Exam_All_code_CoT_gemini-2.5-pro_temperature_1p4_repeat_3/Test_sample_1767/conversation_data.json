    "When two topological systems, like Chern insulators, are joined together, the Chern number of the resulting combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components. This is a fundamental property of topological invariants.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1. When they are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system. The Chern number of this new system is calculated by adding the Chern numbers of the two initial insulators.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs this calculation and displays the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern number for each insulator\nchern_number_1 = 1\nchern_number_2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\ntotal_chern_number = chern_number_1 + chern_number_2\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"The Chern number of a composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its parts.\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the first insulator: C1 = {chern_number_1}\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the second insulator: C2 = {chern_number_2}\")\nprint(\"The total Chern number of the junction is C_total = C1 + C2.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {chern_number_1} + {chern_number_2} = {total_chern_number}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
