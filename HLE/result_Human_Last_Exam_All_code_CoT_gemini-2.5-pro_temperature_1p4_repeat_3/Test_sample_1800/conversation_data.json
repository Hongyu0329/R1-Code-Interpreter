    "Of course. Finding the ideal catalyst composition is a key challenge in materials science. Instead of a direct calculation, I will provide a Python script that reviews and presents the findings from scientific literature on this topic.\n\nHere is my plan to address your question:\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to know the ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions. This requires information from experimental scientific studies, not a direct calculation.\n2.  **Format the Response:** The request specifies the answer should be in a Python code block. Therefore, I will write a script that uses `print()` statements to explain the findings from the literature. This fulfills the formatting requirement while delivering a correct, evidence-based answer.\n3.  **Synthesize Information:** I will synthesize information from various catalysis studies. The \"ideal\" ratio is not a single number but often a range that depends on reaction conditions and synthesis methods. The script will explain this nuance.\n4.  **Structure the Code:** The Python script will define key variables representing the optimal ratios found in research. It will then print a clear, structured explanation covering the roles of Ni and Ceria, the optimal ratios for WGS, the optimal ratios for WS, and a concluding summary.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts\n    based on findings from scientific literature for the Water Gas Shift (WGS)\n    and Water Splitting (WS) reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- General Principles ---\n    print(\"--- Understanding Ni-Ceria Catalysts ---\")\n    print(\"The effectiveness of Ni-Ceria catalysts depends on the synergy between Nickel (Ni) and Ceria (CeO2).\")\n    print(\" - Ni: Provides the active sites for the chemical reaction.\")\n    print(\" - Ceria (CeO2): Acts as a support that enhances activity.
