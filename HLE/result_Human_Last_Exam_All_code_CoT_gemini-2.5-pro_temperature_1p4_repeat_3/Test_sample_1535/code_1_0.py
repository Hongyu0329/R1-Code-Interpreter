# Analysis of the clinical case to determine the expected location of a rash.

# Step 1: Identify key information from the vignette.
patient_findings = {
    "symptoms": ["muscle weakness", "myalgia", "arthralgia", "fatigue"],
    "physical_exam": "periorbital erythema (redness around the eyes)"

print(f"- Symptoms suggesting systemic inflammation: {patient_findings['symptoms']}")
print(f"- Key physical exam finding: {patient_findings['physical_exam']}")

# Step 2: Formulate a probable diagnosis based on the classic signs.
# The combination of muscle weakness and periorbital erythema (Heliotrope rash) is classic for Dermatomyositis.
diagnosis = "Dermatomyositis"
print(f"\nThe combination of these findings points to a diagnosis of: {diagnosis}")

# Step 3: Identify other characteristic signs of the suspected diagnosis.
# A second pathognomonic (highly specific) skin finding in Dermatomyositis is Gottron's papules/sign.

# Step 4: Determine the anatomical location of this secondary sign.
location_of_secondary_sign = "Dorsum of the hands"
print(f"The typical location for {secondary_sign} is the {location_of_secondary_sign}.")

# Step 5: Match the location with the given answer choices.
# Choice A is "Dorsum of the hands".
