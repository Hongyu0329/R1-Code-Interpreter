    This function encapsulates the reasoning to select the correct model.
    1. The response `y` can be negative because of the `rnorm(..., continent, .1)` term. This rules out all Gamma and Poisson models. Only Models 1 and 6, which use a Normal distribution, remain.
    2. The data has a nested structure: `country` is nested within `continent`. The slope of the `x` variable depends on `country`.
    3. Model 6 models the slope (`beta.2[country[i]]`) as a random effect of `country`, but its prior `dnorm(beta.1, tau_b.1)` does not depend on the continent. This fails to capture the nesting.
    4. Model 1 models the slope (`beta.3[continent[i], country[i]]`) with a correctly specified nested prior: `beta.3[j,k] ~ dnorm(beta.2[j], ...)`. The slope for a country `k` depends on its continent `j`.
    5. Therefore, Model 1 is the most correctly specified model.

print("1. Distribution: The term `rnorm(..., continent, .1)` can be negative, which means 'y' can be negative. This eliminates all models using Gamma or Poisson distributions, leaving only Models 1 and 6 which correctly use a Normal distribution.")
print("2. Hierarchy: The `country` effect is nested within the `continent` effect. The slope of 'x' in the model for E[y] depends on `country`, so the model must correctly represent this nested structure.")
