    "To find a left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ for the given transfer function $H(s)$, we will follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Initial Factorization**: We'll start by expressing the transfer function matrix $H(s)$ with a common denominator. This gives an initial, but not necessarily coprime, left factorization of the form $H(s) = [d(s)I]^{-1} N_0(s)$, where $d(s)$ is the least common denominator and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\n2.  **Coprimeness Check**: A factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is left coprime if and only if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. We will check for this condition. The rank can typically drop at the values of $s$ that are poles of the system (i.e., roots of the determinant of $D(s)$).\n\n3.  **Extraction of Common Factors**: If the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ drops for some $s_0$, it indicates the presence of a common left divisor, $G(s)$, such that $\\det(G(s_0)) = 0$. We will use polynomial matrix operations to find and extract these common divisors. This process is repeated until no more common factors can be found.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial Factorization**\n    The given transfer function is:\n    \\[\n    H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The least common multiple of the denominators is $d(s) = s^2-1$. We rewrite $H(s)$ as:\n    \\[\n    H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    This gives an initial factorization with $D_0(s) = (s^2-1)I = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N_0(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n2.  **Coprimeness Check and Simplification at s=1**\n    We check the rank of $[D_0(s) \\quad N_0(s)]$ at the roots of $\\det(D_0(s))=(s^2-1)^2=0$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    At $s=1$, the matrix $[D_0(1) \\quad N_0(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ has rank 1, so the factorization is not coprime. The first row of $[D_0(s) \\quad N_0(s)]$ is divisible by $(s-1)$. Extracting this factor leads to a new factorization $(D_1(s), N_1(s))$:\n    \\[\n    D_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n3.  **Coprimeness Check and Simplification at s=-1**\n    We check the new pair $(D_1(s), N_1(s))$. At $s=-1$, the matrix $[D_1(-1) \\quad N_1(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ has rank 1. This is not coprime.\n    The rows are linearly dependent at $s=-1$ (row 1 + row 2 = 0). This suggests a common factor can be revealed by adding the rows. We apply a unimodular transformation that adds row 2 to row 1. This gives a matrix $[D'(s) \\quad N'(s)]$ where the first row is:\n    $[s+1, s^2-1, s+1, s+1]$. Every element is divisible by $(s+1)$.\n    We extract this factor $(s+1)$ from the first row, resulting in our final matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n4.  **Final Coprime Factorization**\n    After extracting all common left divisors, we obtain the following left coprime factorization:\n    \\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    \\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    The composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ has full rank (rank 2) for all complex $s$, confirming that this factorization is indeed left coprime.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to define and display the resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the matrices for the left coprime factorization\n    H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) for the given transfer function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the denominator matrix D(s)\n    D_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Define the numerator matrix N(s)\n    N_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n\n    # Print the results in a structured format\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) where:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D_s)\n    \n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N_s)\n    \n    print(\"\\nIn equation form, H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s):\")\n    \n    # Printing D(s) element-wise\n    print(f\"D(s) = [[{D_s[0,0]}, {D_s[0,1]}],\")\n    print(f\"        [{D_s[1,0]}, {D_s[1,1]}]]\")\n    \n    # Printing N(s) element-wise\n    print(f\"N(s) = [[{N_s[0,0]}, {N_s[0,1]}],\")\n    print(f\"        [{N_s[1,0]}, {N_s[1,1]}]]\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_coprime_factorization()\n```\n<<<\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the matrices for the left coprime factorization\n    H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) for the given transfer function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the denominator matrix D(s)\n    D_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Define the numerator matrix N(s)\n    N_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n\n    # Print the results in a structured format\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) where:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D_s)\n    \n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N_s)\n    \n    print(\"\\nIn equation form, H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s):\")\n    \n    # Printing D(s) element-wise\n    print(f\"D(s) = [[{D_s[0,0]}, {D_s[0,1]}],\")\n    print(f\"        [{D_s[1,0]}, {D_s[1,1]}]]\")\n    \n    # Printing N(s) element-wise\n    print(f\"N(s) = [[{N_s[0,0]}, {N_s[0,1]}],\")\n    print(f\"        [{N_s[1,0]}, {N_s[1,1]}]]\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_coprime_factorization()\n```>>>"
