    "### The Three Longest Rivers Mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid\n\nThe epic Roman poem, the *Aeneid*, by Virgil, mentions both real and mythological rivers. When considering the longest among them, it is essential to distinguish between the two, as mythological rivers of the underworld do not have a measurable length. The three longest real-world rivers mentioned in the epic are the Tiber, the Aufidus (modern-day Ofanto), and the Acheron.\n\n**1. The Tiber River**\n\nThe most prominent river in the latter half of the *Aeneid* is the Tiber, which flows through the heart of Latium, the region where the Trojans finally settle. The city of Rome itself was founded on its banks. The Tiber is the third-longest river in Italy, with a length of approximately 406 kilometers (252 miles).\n\n**2. The Aufidus River**\n\nThe Aufidus river, now known as the Ofanto, is also mentioned in the *Aeneid*. This river flows through the region of Apulia in southern Italy. Depending on the source, its length is cited as being between 134 and 170 kilometers (83 to 106 miles).\n\n**3. The Acheron River**\n\nWhile the Acheron is a significant river in Greek mythology, marking the boundary of the underworld, it is also a real river in the Epirus region of northwestern Greece. Virgil incorporates both its mythological and geographical identity in the *Aeneid*. The real Acheron river is 52 kilometers (32 miles) long.\n\n**Mythological Rivers of the Underworld**\n\nThe *Aeneid* also famously describes the rivers of the Greek underworld, which Aeneas encounters in Book VI. These include:\n\n*   **The Styx:** The river of hatred which the gods swore oaths upon.\n*   **The Phlegethon:** The river of fire.\n*   **The Cocytus:** The river of wailing.\n*   **The Lethe:** The river of forgetfulness.\n\nWhile these rivers are central to the narrative of Aeneas's descent into the underworld, they are mythological constructs and thus do not have a defined physical length. There are several real-world rivers named Styx and Lethe, but these are modern namesakes and not the rivers of antiquity mentioned in the *Aeneid*.\n\nAnother real river mentioned is the Sarnus (modern Sarno), which is approximately 24 kilometers long and thus shorter than the Acheron.\n\n<<<The three longest real rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Tiber, the Aufidus, and the Acheron.>>>"
