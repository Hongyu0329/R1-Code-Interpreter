    "Large deviation theory, particularly through the lens of Boltzmann's work which preceded and inspired Sanov's theorem, provides a framework for understanding equilibrium in statistical mechanics. The core principle is that the equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the most probable macroscopic configuration, which is the one that can be realized by the greatest number of microscopic arrangements. This is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy subject to macroscopic constraints.\n\nFor the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas in thermal equilibrium, such as black-body radiation), the particles are bosons, and their total number is not conserved, which implies a chemical potential of zero. The single macroscopic constraint is the total mean energy of the gas.\n\nThe application of the maximum entropy principle, which is the physical manifestation of the large deviation theorems, yields the equilibrium distribution and consequently the equilibrium values for thermodynamic quantities.\n\n### 1. The Equilibrium Distribution\n\nFollowing the principle of maximum entropy for a gas of bosons with zero chemical potential, constrained by a fixed mean energy `U`, we find the equilibrium occupation number for a quantum state with energy ε. This maximization procedure yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\n\n<center>\n    `f(ε) = 1 / (exp(ε/kT) - 1)`\n</center>\n\nHere, `f(ε)` is the average number of photons in a state of energy `ε`, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe total mean energy, `U`, of the photon gas is found by integrating the energy of each state multiplied by its occupation number and the density of states over all possible energies. The density of states, `g(ε)`, for photons in a volume `V` is given by `g(ε) = (8πV / (h³c³))ε²`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe total mean energy is then:\n<center>\n    `U = ∫₀^∞ ε * f(ε) * g(ε) dε = ∫₀^∞ ε * (1 / (exp(ε/kT) - 1)) * ((8πV / (h³c³))ε²) dε`\n</center>\n\nSolving this integral leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of a photon gas:\n\n<center>\n    `U(V, T) = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n</center>\n\nThis is the equilibrium value of the mean energy for a photon gas. It is proportional to the volume `V` and the fourth power of the temperature `T`. The average energy per photon is approximately `2.701kT`.\n\n### 3. Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy, `S`, of the photon gas at equilibrium can be calculated from the Bose-Einstein distribution. The entropy for a system of bosons is given by:\n\n<center>\n    `S/k = ∫₀^∞ g(ε) * [ (f(ε) + 1)ln(f(ε) + 1) - f(ε)ln(f(ε)) ] dε`\n</center>\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium distribution `f(ε)` and integrating yields the equilibrium entropy for the photon gas:\n\n<center>\n    `S(V, T) = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³`\n</center>\n\nThis is the equilibrium value of the entropy, which is proportional to the volume `V` and the third power of the temperature `T`. This result is also consistent with the thermodynamic relation for a photon gas, `S = (4/3)U/T`.\n\nIn summary, by applying the large deviation principle of maximizing entropy for a constrained system, we derive the fundamental equilibrium properties of a photon gas.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\nThe equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`U(V, T) = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nThe equilibrium entropy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is:\n`S(V, T) = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³`\n>>>"
