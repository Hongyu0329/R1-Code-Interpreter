**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**
The equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
`U(V, T) = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴`

**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**
The equilibrium entropy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is:
`S(V, T) = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³`
