    "The island town that is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name is Hanga Roa.\n\nHanga Roa is the main town and capital of Easter Island, a Chilean territory in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, with its nearest inhabited neighbor, Pitcairn Island, located over 2,000 kilometers away.\n\nThe name \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"wide bay\" or \"long bay\" in the native Rapa Nui language. The town is situated on the island's west coast in a lowland area between two extinct volcanoes, Maunga Terevaka and Rano Kau.\n\nThe bay on which the town is located is known as Hanga Roa Bay. This bay is part of the larger volcanic landscape of the island and is proximate to the significant caldera of the Rano Kau volcano. The Rano Kau volcano, which is adjacent to Hanga Roa, has a large, circular, water-filled crater that is a prominent feature of the island.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
