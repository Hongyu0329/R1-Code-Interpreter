    "An isometric embedding of a metric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ may not always exist. The existence depends on whether the distances in $X$ can be realized as norms of vectors in $B$. This leads to the possibility that for a given pair $(X, B)$, the number of isometric embeddings is zero. As the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a simple example:\n\n1.  **Choose a finite ultrametric space $X$**: Let $X = \\{a, b\\}$ be a two-point space. All two-point metric spaces are trivially ultrametric. Let the distance be $d(a, b) = 2$.\n\n2.  **Choose a Banach space $B$**: Consider the field of 3-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_3$. This field is a complete metric space with respect to the 3-adic norm, $|\\cdot|_3$, and can be considered a Banach space over itself. The non-zero values of the 3-adic norm are integer powers of 3, i.e., $\\{3^n : n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{\\dots, 9, 3, 1, 1/3, 1/9, \\dots\\}$.\n\n3.  **Check for an isometric embedding**: An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ must satisfy $\\|f(a) - f(b)\\|_B = d(a, b)$. In our case, this means we need to find two points $x_a, x_b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_3$ such that $|x_a - x_b|_3 = 2$. Let $v = x_a - x_b$. The condition becomes $|v|_3 = 2$.\n\nHowever, the set of possible non-zero values for the 3-adic norm does not include the number 2. Therefore, no such vector $v$ exists in $\\mathbb{Q}_3$, and consequently, no isometric embedding of this specific space $X$ into $\\mathbb{Q}_3$ is possible.\n\nSince we have found a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which there are no isometric embeddings, the number of such embeddings is 0.\n\nA simpler example involves the trivial Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$. Its cardinality is $K=1$. If we take any finite ultrametric space $X$ with at least two distinct points $a$ and $b$ (so $d(a,b) > 0$), an isometric embedding $f$ would need to satisfy $\\|f(a)-f(b)\\| = d(a,b) > 0$. But in $B=\\{0\\}$, the only available element is 0, so $f(a)=f(b)=0$, and thus $\\|f(a)-f(b)\\| = \\|0-0\\| = 0$. This contradicts the condition that the embedding must preserve the positive distance $d(a,b)$. Thus, no isometric embedding exists, and their number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
