    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal. The total welfare is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus at this equilibrium point.\n\nThe given functions are:\n*   **Supply:** `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n*   **Demand:** `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\n**1. Market Equilibrium**\n\nTo find the equilibrium quantity (Qe), we set the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n`ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q))`\n\nSolving this equation analytically is not feasible. Using numerical methods, we find the approximate equilibrium quantity to be:\n`Qe ≈ 4.709`\n\nWe can then find the equilibrium price (Pe) by substituting Qe into either the supply or demand function. Using the supply function:\n`Pe = ln((4.709)^3 - 2) ≈ ln(104.42 - 2) = ln(102.42) ≈ 4.629`\n\nThus, the market equilibrium is approximately at (Qe, Pe) = (4.709, 4.629).\n\n**2. Total Welfare Calculation**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price.\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Qe] (D(Q) - Pe) dQ = ∫[0 to 4.709] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (4.629 * 4.709)`\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The supply function is defined for `Q > ∛2`.\n    `PS = ∫[∛2 to Qe] (Pe - S(Q)) dQ = (4.629 * 4.709) - ∫[∛2 to 4.709] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\nThe total welfare is `TW = CS + PS`, which simplifies to:\n`TW = ∫[0 to 4.709] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[∛2 to 4.709] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\nThese integrals do not have elementary antiderivatives and must be solved numerically.\n\n*   The value of the integral for the area under the demand curve is:\n    `∫[0 to 4.709] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ ≈ 37.16`\n*   The value of the integral for the area under the supply curve is:\n    `∫[∛2 to 4.709] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ ≈ 9.04` (where `∛2 ≈ 1.26`)\n\nThe total welfare is the difference between these two values:\n`TW ≈ 37.16 - 9.04 = 28.12`\n\n<<<28.12>>>"
