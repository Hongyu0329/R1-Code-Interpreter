    "In Kurt Vonnegut's novel *Slaughterhouse-Five*, the character of Billy Pilgrim's mother has a picture of Saint Sebastian. Vonnegut describes the image of the saint as a \"human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\"\n\nSaint Sebastian was an early Christian who was martyred for his faith. He was a Roman soldier, and descriptions of him and other saints who were soldiers sometimes use the term \"saintly soldier.\"\n\n<<<Saintly Soldier>>>"
