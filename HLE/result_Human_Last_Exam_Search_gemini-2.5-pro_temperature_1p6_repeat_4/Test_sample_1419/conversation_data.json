    "In the framework of the $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as $u^*$, is a cornerstone of the renormalization group analysis of critical phenomena. This fixed point describes the non-trivial, scale-invariant behavior of the system at a critical point. Its value, to the leading order in $\\epsilon = 4-d$ (where $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions), can be determined from the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant $u$.\n\nThe beta function, $\\beta(u)$, dictates the running of the coupling constant with the energy scale. At the one-loop level, it is given by:\n\n$\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$\n\nA fixed point of the renormalization group flow is a value of the coupling $u^*$ for which the beta function vanishes, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$. This condition signifies that the coupling constant no longer changes with the energy scale, leading to scale invariance.\n\nSetting the beta function to zero yields the equation:\n\n$-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n\nThis equation has two solutions. One is the trivial or Gaussian fixed point at $u^*=0$. The other is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Assuming $u^* \\neq 0$, we can solve for it:\n\n$\\epsilon u^* = \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2}$\n\nDividing by $u^*$, we obtain the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}{3}$>>>"
