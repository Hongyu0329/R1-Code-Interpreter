Given that your headache could be a side effect of your new medications and the smell of the sea water may be a rare side effect of fluoxetine, it is important to discuss these symptoms with your doctor. Most critically, the Excedrin you took contains aspirin, which can interact with your fluoxetine and increase your risk of bleeding. For future headaches, it would be safer to use a product containing only acetaminophen, as long as you don't have any liver problems and don't exceed the maximum daily dose. Please consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking any new over-the-counter medications.
