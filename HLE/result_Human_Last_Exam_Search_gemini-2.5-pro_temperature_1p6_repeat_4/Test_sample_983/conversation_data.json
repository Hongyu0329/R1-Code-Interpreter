    "The sequence provided is a list of four-digit numbers. A close inspection reveals that all the numbers in the sequence are divisible by 6. This is a significant clue to understanding the pattern. The list is a subsequence of all four-digit numbers divisible by 6, ordered from smallest to largest.\n\nTo determine the next number, we must identify the rule that dictates which numbers divisible by 6 are included in the sequence. Let's analyze the sum of the digits of each number in the sequence:\n\n*   1014 → 1+0+1+4 = 6\n*   1020 → 1+0+2+0 = 3\n*   1032 → 1+0+3+2 = 6\n*   1050 → 1+0+5+0 = 6\n*   1104 → 1+1+0+4 = 6\n*   1224 → 1+2+2+4 = 9\n*   1230 → 1+2+3+0 = 6\n*   1290 → 1+2+9+0 = 12\n*   1410 → 1+4+1+0 = 6\n*   1440 → 1+4+4+0 = 9\n*   1452 → 1+4+5+2 = 12\n*   1482 → 1+4+8+2 = 15\n*   1500 → 1+5+0+0 = 6\n*   1512 → 1+5+1+2 = 9\n*   1560 → 1+5+6+0 = 12\n*   1584 → 1+5+8+4 = 18\n*   1602 → 1+6+0+2 = 9\n*   1734 → 1+7+3+4 = 15\n*   1812 → 1+8+1+2 = 12\n*   1890 → 1+8+9+0 = 18\n*   1902 → 1+9+0+2 = 12\n*   1932 → 1+9+3+2 = 15\n*   1974 → 1+9+7+4 = 21\n*   2004 → 2+0+0+4 = 6\n*   2040 → 2+0+4+0 = 6\n*   2064 → 2+0+6+4 = 12\n*   2070 → 2+0+7+0 = 9\n*   2130 → 2+1+3+0 = 6\n*   2142 → 2+1+4+2 = 9\n*   2274 → 2+2+7+4 = 15\n*   2340 → 2+3+4+0 = 9\n*   2352 → 2+3+5+2 = 12\n\nThe sequence of the sums of the digits is: 6, 3, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 12, 6, 9, 12, 15, 6, 9, 12, 18, 9, 15, 12, 18, 12, 15, 21, 6, 6, 12, 9, 6, 9, 15, 9, 12.\n\nLooking at the end of this sequence of sums, we have (...9, 12). We can look for a similar pattern earlier in the sequence. We find the subsequence (...6, 9, 12, 15...). Following this pattern, the number after a sum of 12 (which was preceded by a 9) should have a sum of digits of 15.\n\nThe last number in the given sequence is 2352. We need to find the next number after 2352 that is divisible by 6 and has a sum of digits equal to 15.\nLet's check the numbers divisible by 6 after 2352:\n*   The next number divisible by 6 is 2358. The sum of its digits is 2+3+5+8 = 18.\n*   The number after that is 2364. The sum of its digits is 2+3+6+4 = 15.\n\nThis matches our derived pattern. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 2364.\n\n<<<2364>>>"
