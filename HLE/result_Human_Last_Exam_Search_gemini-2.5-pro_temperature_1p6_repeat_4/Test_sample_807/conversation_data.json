    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Hot Magenta**.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is the IUPAC name for Rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye known for its vibrant pink and red hues. Crayola introduced a line of fluorescent crayons in 1972, which included the color \"Hot Magenta\".\n\nThe bright, fluorescent quality of Rhodamine B aligns with the appearance of Crayola's neon and fluorescent color collections. These crayons are known to glow under black light, a characteristic of fluorescent compounds like Rhodamine B. While Crayola does not publicly disclose the specific pigment formulations for their crayons, citing proprietary information, the visual and functional properties of Rhodamine B strongly suggest its use in their brightest pink crayons.\n\nAdditionally, the color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" introduced in 1990, was originally named \"Hot Magenta\" from its creation in 1972 until its renaming. Both \"Hot Magenta\" and \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" are listed among Crayola's fluorescent crayon colors.\n\n<<<Hot Magenta>>>"
