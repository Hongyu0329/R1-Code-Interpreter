    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is through the direct chemical reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas. This process involves heating the two elements in a sealed nickel vessel. Nickel is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel fluoride on its surface, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nTo achieve an efficient yield of XeF₄, the reaction conditions must be carefully controlled. The synthesis is typically performed by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, generally in a 1:5 molar ratio, to a temperature of 400°C (752°F). The reaction is exothermic, releasing 251 kJ/mol of energy. The pressure is usually maintained at around 6 atmospheres.\n\nWhile the temperature for the reaction can range between 350°C and 450°C, 400°C is the most frequently cited optimal temperature. Varying the temperature can affect the product distribution; lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂), whereas higher temperatures can lead to the production of xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Therefore, maintaining a temperature of 400°C is crucial for the efficient and specific production of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\nOther synthesis methods exist, such as using an electric discharge or photochemical activation, but these often result in a mixture of products, including significant contamination with XeF₂, making them less efficient for producing pure XeF₄.\n\nBased on the available methods, 400°C is the lowest temperature among the choices that allows for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
