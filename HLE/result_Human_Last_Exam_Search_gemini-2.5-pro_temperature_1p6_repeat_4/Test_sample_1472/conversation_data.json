    "The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The two most common forms are the copper(I) and copper(II) complexes, and they exhibit different molecular geometries and therefore different point group symmetries.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)\n\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation, [Cu(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>S<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, typically adopts a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. The specific arrangement of the two bidentate ligands around the central copper ion results in a structure that possesses a 4-fold improper rotation axis (S<sub>4</sub>). The point group for this molecule is therefore **S<sub>4</sub>**. This S<sub>4</sub> symmetry arises from a specific folding of the ligands, creating a compact, nearly spherical shape for the cation.\n\n### Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)\n\nIn the case of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, such as [Cu(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>S<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>](BF<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, the copper ion is in a +2 oxidation state. The coordination geometry is described as a distorted octahedron. The two dithiahexane ligands coordinate to the copper through their sulfur atoms, occupying the four equatorial positions. The two axial positions are occupied by fluorine atoms from the tetrafluoroborate counter-ions. The crystal structure of this complex reveals that the [Cu(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>S<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> cation is located on a crystallographic inversion center. This means the cation possesses a center of inversion and its point group is **C<sub>i</sub>**.\n\nIn summary, the point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) is S<sub>4</sub>, while the point group for the cation in the common crystalline form of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) is C<sub>i</sub>. As the copper(I) complex is frequently used as a textbook example of S<sub>4</sub> symmetry, this is a particularly notable feature of this system.\n\n<<<The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper. For the copper(I) complex, the point group is S4. For the copper(II) complex cation, it is Ci.>>>"
