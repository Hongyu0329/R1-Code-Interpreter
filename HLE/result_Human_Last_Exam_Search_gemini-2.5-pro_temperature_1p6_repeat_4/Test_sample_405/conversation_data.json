    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least four distinct colors: white, red, violet, and black.\n\nThe primary and most well-known allotropes of phosphorus are named for their characteristic colors. These different forms of the same element exhibit not only varied coloration but also distinct physical and chemical properties.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form, white phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid. However, it frequently appears yellow or brownish due to the presence of impurities or as it begins to transform into the more stable red allotrope, a process accelerated by light and heat. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is more stable than white phosphorus and is commonly known for its use on the striking surface of matchboxes. Its color is not a single shade but can vary, ranging from orange-red to a dark red-purple. Some sources describe it as having an iron-grey luster.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form of phosphorus. As its name suggests, it has a violet or purple hue. It has been described as appearing as yellowish-red translucent plates or having a steely blue lustre. When finely powdered, it can appear red.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most thermodynamically stable allotrope of phosphorus, black phosphorus is similar in appearance to graphite. It is a black, flaky solid and is a conductor of electricity.\n\nWhile other forms like \"blue phosphorus\" have been studied, they are typically two-dimensional materials synthesized under specific laboratory conditions, and their bulk, observable color is not as well-established as the four primary allotropes. Another form, diphosphorus, exists as a gas under normal conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the well-characterized, pure allotropes of phosphorus, one can observe four principal colors.\n\n<<<Four>>>"
