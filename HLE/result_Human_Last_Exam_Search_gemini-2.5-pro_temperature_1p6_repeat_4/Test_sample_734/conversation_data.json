    "While Christian thinkers since the early church have grappled with the nature of miracles and their relationship to the natural order, it was **Thomas Aquinas** (c. 1225–1274) who first developed a highly specialized and systematic terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature. This framework is applicable to understanding both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in the natural world as a consequence of the Fall.\n\nAugustine of Hippo, a predecessor to Aquinas, had laid significant groundwork. He argued that miracles are not \"contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as nature.\" In his view, God created the world with \"seminal reasons\" (rationes seminales), which are hidden potentialities within nature that God can activate at any time to produce events we perceive as miraculous. This meant that miracles were part of a deeper, pre-ordained natural order established by God.\n\nBuilding on this, Thomas Aquinas developed a more granular and technical vocabulary for categorizing and explaining events that occur outside the normal course of nature. He defined a miracle as something \"done by divine power apart from the order usually followed in things.\"\n\nAquinas's specialized terminology includes:\n\n*   **Three Ranks of Miracles**: He classified miracles into a hierarchy based on their relationship to natural capacities:\n    1.  **Events God can do that nature cannot**: For instance, the sun reversing its course.\n    2.  **Events God can do that nature can also do, but not in that order or sequence**: Such as the instant healing of a terminal illness that might otherwise heal over a long time, if at all.\n    3.  **Events God can do without the principles of nature that nature normally uses**: For example, a person being cured of a fever instantly by divine power, without the natural processes of recovery.\n\n*   **Obediential Potency (potentia obedientialis)**: This is Aquinas's most crucial and specialized term for this topic. He posited that every created thing has a passive \"obediential potency,\" which is its inherent capacity to be subject to God's direct power and to receive an effect beyond the limits of its own nature. This is not a natural power but a potentiality to \"obey\" a direct command from God to act in a way that transcends its natural laws. As one source explains, \"in the whole creature there is a certain obediential potency, by which the whole creature obeys God in order to receive in itself whatever God wills.\"\n\nThis framework is directly applicable to the specific examples in the question:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth**: Aquinas explicitly uses this logic to explain the virgin birth. He affirms that God made a virgin give birth while remaining a virgin, which is a miracle possible because everything has an \"obediential potentiality to God.\" The virgin birth, therefore, is an event where the natural laws of human reproduction are transcended by God's direct action upon the obediential potency of Mary's body.\n\n*   **The Fall**: Aquinas taught that before the Fall, humanity existed in a state of \"original justice,\" where reason, will, and passions were in harmony and subject to God. The Fall resulted in the loss of this supernatural gift and a wounding of human nature, creating a disordering and a diminished inclination to good. This represents a change in the operative laws of human nature. While the focus here is often on moral and spiritual \"laws,\" Aquinas's concept of God being able to alter the state of his creation through direct power (acting on its obediential potency) provides the vocabulary to describe this fundamental shift in the state of humanity and its environment.\n\nThus, Thomas Aquinas was the first to create this kind of systematic and specialized theological language—particularly the concept of obediential potency and the hierarchical classification of miracles—that could be consistently applied to describe divine interventions that alter the regular course of nature, whether in the unique miracle of the virgin birth or in the foundational change in the state of human nature at the Fall.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
