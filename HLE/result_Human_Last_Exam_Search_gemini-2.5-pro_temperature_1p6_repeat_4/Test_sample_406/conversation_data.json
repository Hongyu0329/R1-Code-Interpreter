    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z is an element (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product of the sets X, Y, and Z such that it remains unchanged by the application of these functions in a specific manner.

The existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed by the following primary conditions:\n\n1.  **Generalized Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must exhibit a certain monotonicity with respect to the ordering of the elements in their domains. An element (x, y, z) is considered to be related to another element (u, v, w) if x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, and z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w. The generalized mixed monotone property for F, G, and H is defined as follows: For any x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z:\n    *   If x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w, then F(x, y, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(u, v, w).\n    *   If y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, then G(y, x, y) ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(v, u, v).\n    *   If z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, then H(z, y, x) ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(w, v, u).\n\n2.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contraction-type inequality. This means that applying the functions to two related triples brings their images closer together in the metric sense. There exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, and z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w, the following inequality holds:\n\n    d<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + l * d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + m * d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w)\n\n3.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist an initial triple (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies:\n    *   x<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)\n    *   y<sub>0</sub> ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>)\n    *   z<sub>0</sub> ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>0</sub>)\n\n4.  **Continuity or a Regularity Property:** Either the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the spaces (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>) possess a regularity property. This property ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence converges to a limit, then each term of the sequence is less than or equal to the limit, and if a non-increasing sequence converges, each term is greater than or equal to the limit.\n\nWhen these conditions are satisfied, there exists a unique triple (x, y, z) that is an FGH-tripled fixed point. The proof of such a theorem typically involves constructing sequences based on the initial point and using the contractive condition to show that these sequences are Cauchy sequences. The completeness of the metric spaces then guarantees the convergence to a point, which is then shown to be the fixed point.\n\n<<<For the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point, the primary conditions are: the functions must satisfy a generalized mixed monotone property and a contractive inequality on the complete partially ordered metric spaces X, Y, and Z.
