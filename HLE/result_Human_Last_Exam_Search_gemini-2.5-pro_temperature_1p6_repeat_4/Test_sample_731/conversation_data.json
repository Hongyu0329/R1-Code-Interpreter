    "A **power subgroup** of a group G is a subgroup that can be generated by the k-th powers of all elements of G, for some positive integer k. To determine the number of distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512, a detailed analysis of its structure and the powers of its elements is required.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD_512, is a non-abelian group with a specific presentation. It can be defined by two generators, 'r' and 's', with the relations:\n*   r^256 = 1\n*   s^2 = 1\n*   srs = r^127\n\nThe elements of SD_512 consist of the 256 powers of 'r' (forming a cyclic subgroup) and another 256 elements obtained by multiplying these powers of 'r' by 's'.\n\nThe power subgroups are of the form G^k, which is the subgroup generated by all elements g^k where g is an element of G. The nature of these subgroups depends on whether the exponent 'k' is odd or even.\n\nWhen 'k' is an odd integer, the resulting power subgroup G^k is the group G itself. This is because the generators 'r' and 's' can both be formed from the k-th powers of the elements of G, thus regenerating the entire group.\n\nWhen 'k' is an even integer, the k-th power of any element in SD_512 will be a power of 'r'. This means that for any even 'k', the power subgroup G^k will be a subgroup of the cyclic subgroup generated by 'r'. Specifically, for an even 'k', the power subgroup G^k is equivalent to the subgroup generated by r^d, where 'd' is the greatest common divisor of 'k' and 256.\n\nSince 'k' is even, 'd' must also be an even divisor of 256. The divisors of 256 are powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. The even divisors are therefore:\n*   2\n*   4\n*   8\n*   16\n*   32\n*   64\n*   128\n*   256\n\nEach of these eight even divisors gives rise to a distinct cyclic subgroup of the subgroup generated by 'r'. These are: <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, and <r^256> (which is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element).\n\nIn total, there is one power subgroup for all odd values of 'k' (which is the group SD_512 itself), and eight distinct power subgroups for all even values of 'k'. Therefore, the total number of distinct power subgroups is 1 + 8 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
