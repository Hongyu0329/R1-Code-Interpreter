    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museums in Berlin) in 1967. The acquisition was a purchase from the artist's widow, Maria Günther. The painting is part of the collection of the Nationalgalerie (National Gallery), which is one of the museums within the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n\n\"The Radionist,\" also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petty Bourgeois at the Radio), was created in the same year that the German radio broadcast began to gain significant societal influence. The artwork is considered a significant piece of the New Objectivity movement. The painting depicts a man, identified as a Mr. Schreck who was a lodger in Günther's house, listening to the radio with headphones. A preparatory graphite study for the painting is housed in the Kunstgalerie Gera.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
