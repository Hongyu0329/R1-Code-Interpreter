    "Based on the provided information, the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau link is calculated to be -5851.\n\nHere is a summary of the calculation process:\n\nFirst, a critical observation is made about the defining polynomial:\n$0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n\nFor the given weights of the ambient space, $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$, almost all monomial terms in the polynomial have a weighted degree of 225. The exception is the second term, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, which has a weighted degree of 224. In the context of Calabi-Yau links derived from such singularities, the polynomial must be weighted-homogeneous. The fact that the degree $d=225$ satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition ($d = \\sum w_i = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$) strongly implies that the non-homogeneous term is a typographical error and the intended degree is 225. The specific form of the polynomial is not required for the invariant's calculation, only its degree and the weights are needed.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is determined by an algorithm developed by Martelli, Sparks, and Yau to find the optimal Reeb vector field that determines the Sasaki-Einstein metric on the link. This iterative algorithm partitions the set of weights.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Step 1:** Calculate an initial parameter $\\lambda_1 = (d/n)^2 = (225/5)^2 = 2025$. The weights whose squares are less than this value form the first set: $\\{22, 29\\}$.\n2.  **Step 2:** Recalculate the parameter with the remaining weights, yielding $\\lambda_2 = ((225 - (22+29))/3)^2 = 58^2 = 3364$. The weights (among the remainder) whose squares are less than this value are added: $\\{49, 50\\}$. The set of excluded weights is now $\\{22, 29, 49, 50\\}$.\n3.  **Step 3:** The process is repeated. The next parameter is $\\lambda_3 = ((225 - (22+29+49+50))/1)^2 = 75^2 = 5625$. The square of the final weight, $75^2$, is not strictly less than this value, so the algorithm terminates.\n\nThe final partition of weights is $S = \\{22, 29, 49, 50\\}$ and $T = \\{75\\}$.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, $\\mathcal{I}$, is calculated using a formula derived from this partitioning:\n$\\mathcal{I} = \\frac{d^2 - (\\sum_{s \\in S} w_s)^2}{\\lambda} - \\sum_{s \\in S} w_s^2$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\frac{d - \\sum_{s \\in S} w_s}{|T|}$.\n\nUsing the values:\n*   $d = 225$\n*   $\\sum_{s \\in S} w_s = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 = 150$\n*   $\\sum_{s \\in S} w_s^2 = 22^2 + 29^2 + 49^2 + 50^2 = 484 + 841 + 2401 + 2500 = 6226$\n*   $\\lambda = (225 - 150) / 1 = 75$\n\nThe invariant is:\n$\\mathcal{I} = \\frac{225^2 - 150^2}{75} - 6226 = \\frac{50625 - 22500}{75} - 6226 = \\frac{28125}{75} - 6226 = 375 - 6226 = -5851$.\n\nA necessary condition for the existence of a Sasaki-Einstein metric on the link is that this invariant be a positive integer. The negative result indicates that this link does not admit such a metric for the canonical Reeb vector choice derived from this procedure.\n\n<<<**-5851**>>>"
