    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is Nikolai Rezanov. The question of his final resting place, which Voznesensky pondered, was a subject of mystery for decades.\n\nNikolai Rezanov was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer who was a central figure in the Russian-American Company and co-led Russia's first circumnavigation of the globe. His story gained widespread fame through Andrei Voznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" (also known as \"Story Under Full Sail\") and the subsequent iconic rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which fictionalized Rezanov's tragic real-life romance with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish governor of California.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while on his way back to St. Petersburg. A monument was erected on his grave in 1831, but it was destroyed in the 1930s, and his grave was lost.\n\nThe answer to Voznesensky's question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\", began to emerge in the late 20th century. Following speculation that his remains had been moved to the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk, a new memorial was eventually dedicated at the presumed burial site. This renewed interest culminated in a ceremony on October 28, 2000, establishing a definitive marker for the long-lost grave.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
