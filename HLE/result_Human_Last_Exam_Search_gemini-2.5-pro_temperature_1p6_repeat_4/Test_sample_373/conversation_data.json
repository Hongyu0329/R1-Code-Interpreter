    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by taking two complete graphs and connecting them with a single edge. To have a total of 10 nodes, these would be two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5). The edge connecting these two K5 components is known as the bottleneck edge.\n\nThe number of edges in a complete graph with 'n' vertices is given by the formula n * (n-1) / 2. For a K5, the number of edges is:\n5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10 edges.\n\nSince the barbell graph in question consists of two K5 graphs, the total number of edges within these two components is:\n2 * 10 = 20 edges.\n\nIn addition to these, there is the single bottleneck edge that connects the two K5 graphs. Therefore, the total number of edges in the 10-node barbell graph is:\n20 (from the two K5s) + 1 (the bottleneck edge) = 21 edges.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, when considering the sampling of edges, it is implied that each edge has an equal probability of being selected.\n\nThe probability of sampling any specific edge is 1 divided by the total number of edges. Since there is only one bottleneck edge, the probability of sampling it is:\n\nProbability = 1 / 21\n\nThis simplifies to approximately 0.0476.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
