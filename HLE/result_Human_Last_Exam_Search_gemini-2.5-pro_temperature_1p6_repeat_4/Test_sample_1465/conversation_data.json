    "An exhaustive search for the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences has been conducted. Despite investigating various prediction tools and searching for publications or datasets that might contain these specific sequences, no definitive data on their oligomeric states could be located within the public domain accessible through search.\n\nThe initial investigation identified several computational tools designed to predict the oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins, including LOGICOIL, Multicoil2, and CoCoNat. These tools are generally available as web servers or downloadable packages. Subsequent targeted searches for predictions for each individual peptide sequence, and for the set of sequences as a whole, did not yield any specific results. There is no indication in the search results that these sequences are part of a well-known and characterized benchmark dataset or have been used as examples in primary literature describing the *de novo* design of coiled-coil peptides.\n\nWithout access to run the prediction tools directly on the provided sequences, and with no published data found, it is impossible to determine their specific oligomeric states. Therefore, the information is not available through the performed searches.\n\n<<<A>>>"
