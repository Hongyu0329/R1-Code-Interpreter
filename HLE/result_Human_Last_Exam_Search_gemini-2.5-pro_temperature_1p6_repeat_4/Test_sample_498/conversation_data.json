    "This is a classic letter puzzle based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nThe sequence of letters corresponds to the bottom row of a keyboard, moving from left to right.\n\n*   **Z**\n*   **X**\n*   **X** (This is a repetition, likely a \"typo\" in the puzzle to make it more challenging)\n*   **C**\n*   **V**\n*   **Y** (This is another \"typo\"; the typist's finger went to the row above. The intended key was likely B)\n*   **B**\n*   **N**\n\nIf you trace these letters on a QWERTY keyboard, you will see they follow the bottom row. The next letter in this sequence, moving one position to the right from N, is M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
