    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms. This is based on the molecular structure of the original nanocar designed by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University in 2005.\n\nThe term \"nanocar\" can refer to a variety of molecular structures with different chemical formulas developed for various purposes, including the Nanocar Race. However, the original 2005 design is the most foundational. Its full chemical structure, including its sidechains, has a molecular formula of **C430H274O12**.\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" in organic chemistry indicates that all hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon framework of the molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a \"perfluoronanocar,\" one must count the number of hydrogen atoms in the original molecule.\n\nBased on the molecular formula of the original nanocar, there are 274 hydrogen atoms. In a hypothetical perfluorinated version, each of these 274 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by a fluorine atom.\n\n<<<274>>>"
