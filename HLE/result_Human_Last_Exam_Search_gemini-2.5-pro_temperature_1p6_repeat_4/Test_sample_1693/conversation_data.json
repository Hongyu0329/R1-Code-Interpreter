    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the submarine **Doris (Q135)**.\n\nThe *Doris*, a *Circ√©*-class coastal submarine, was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-9 on the night of May 8-9, 1940, while on patrol in the North Sea off the coast of the Netherlands. The submarine had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons and a submerged displacement of 776 tons. All 45 men on board, including her French crew and three Royal Navy liaison personnel, were killed in the sinking.\n\nWhile several larger French warships, primarily destroyers, were lost in the period leading up to the armistice, their sinkings were attributed to other causes such as air attacks, mines, or torpedoes from surface vessels, not from U-boats. For instance, the destroyer *Grafton* was sunk by U-62 on May 29, 1940, during the Dunkirk evacuation, but it was a British Royal Navy vessel. Therefore, the *Doris* stands as the largest French naval loss to a German U-boat before the French surrender.\n\n<<<Doris>>>"
