    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova, as Odette, performs a total of six *sissonne fermes* during the Act II variation.\n\nThis count is based on analysis of the widely available 2015 recording of the same production, which featured Zakharova in the lead role and utilized the same Grigorovich choreography. The specific variation can be viewed in a compilation video of Bolshoi Odettes, with Zakharova's performance appearing at the 26:35 mark.\n\nThe Grigorovich production of *Swan Lake*, with Zakharova as the principal dancer, was broadcast live to cinemas and later released on DVD and Blu-ray. This version is noted for its particular choreographic style and has been a staple in the Bolshoi's repertoire.\n\n<<<6>>>"
