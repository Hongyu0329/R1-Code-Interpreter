    "There is only one wallpaper group with a point group of order 2. This is the wallpaper group designated as **p2**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** There are 17 distinct wallpaper groups, which are mathematical classifications of two-dimensional repetitive patterns based on their symmetries.\n*   **Point Groups:** For each wallpaper group, the \"point group\" is the set of symmetry operations (like rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed.\n*   **Point Group of Order 2:** A point group of order 2 has exactly two symmetry operations: the identity operation and one other operation. The point group designated as C₂ (or just \"2\" in Hermann-Mauguin notation) is of order 2 and consists of the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n\nAmong the 17 wallpaper groups, only the **p2** group has the point group C₂. While other wallpaper groups such as pmm, pmg, and pgg also contain 180-degree rotations, they also include reflection or glide reflection symmetries. This results in them having a more complex point group, specifically D₂, which has an order of 4.\n\nTherefore, the only wallpaper group whose point group has an order of 2 is **p2**.\n\n<<<1>>>"
