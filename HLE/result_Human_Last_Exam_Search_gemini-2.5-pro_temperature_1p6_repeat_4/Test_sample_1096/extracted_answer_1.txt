The best choice for the pair of learning rates $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is given by the set:
$$ \left\{ \frac{1}{\frac{\kappa+1}{2} - \frac{\kappa-1}{2\sqrt{2}}}, \frac{1}{\frac{\kappa+1}{2} + \frac{\kappa-1}{2\sqrt{2}}} \right\} $$
These can also be written in the following form:
$$ \left\{ \frac{4(\kappa+1) + 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1}, \frac{4(\kappa+1) - 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1} \right\} $$
The notation $S:=\sqrt{M^2+(M-1)^2}$ is not standard for this problem and does not appear in the final expressions derived from the Chebyshev analysis.
