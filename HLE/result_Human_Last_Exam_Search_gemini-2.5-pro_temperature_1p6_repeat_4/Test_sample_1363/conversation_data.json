    "In the **Viennese Waltz**, it is considered technically impractical and almost impossible to overturn a reverse turn, especially for the purpose of navigating a corner, without disregarding the fundamental technique of the dance.\n\nThe Viennese Waltz is characterized by its fast, continuous, and flowing rotational movement around the dance floor. The reverse turn, a left-turning figure, has a specific technique that includes a crossing of the feet. To navigate a corner of the ballroom, a significant amount of extra turn would be required in the reverse turn. Attempting to add this much rotation at the high speed of the Viennese Waltz is \"very very difficult\" and \"extremely hard\" for the dancers, particularly for the partner moving forward.\n\nAs a result, it is standard technique to avoid overturning the reverse turn at a corner. Dancers will instead typically dance the reverse turns along the long sides of the ballroom and switch to natural (right-turning) turns, which can be easily under-turned, to navigate the corners. For this reason, some experts even state that \"nobody turns the corner in a reverse turn.\" While a slight overturn might be technically possible on a straight line, the amount needed for a corner would disrupt the continuous, smooth, and rapid nature that is the core of the Viennese Waltz technique.\n\nIn contrast, the other dances listed have variations that explicitly involve overturning turns or connecting figures.\n*   **English Waltz** and **Slow Foxtrot** have \"overturned\" versions of figures like the spin turn. While perhaps challenging, these are recognized variations. In Slow Foxtrot, an \"overturned\" Natural Weave is also a recognized figure.\n*   In **Quickstep**, there are several figures that can be overturned, such as the \"Overturned Progressive Chasse\" or \"Overturned V6\" which can then lead into a reverse turn. This indicates that overturning is an accepted, albeit advanced, part of the dance's technique.\n*   While there is less specific information about overturning the **European Tango** reverse turn in the search results, the staccato nature and the absence of continuous swing would likely make directional changes more manageable than in a Viennese Waltz, though the characteristic walk and connection would still need to be maintained.\n\nTherefore, the Viennese Waltz is the dance where overturning a reverse turn fundamentally conflicts with its core technical principles.\n\n<<<A>>>"
