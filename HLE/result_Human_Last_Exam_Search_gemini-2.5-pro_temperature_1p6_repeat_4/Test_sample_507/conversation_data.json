    "An example of two languages from distinct Asian cultures with no direct contact—where the words for \"broom,\" \"mom,\" and \"dad\" show remarkable similarity—are **Korean** and **Hindi**.\n\nThese languages belong to entirely different language families (Koreanic and Indo-Aryan, respectively) and are separated geographically by China. While historical records show indirect cultural contact, primarily through the transmission of Buddhism, this did not extend to the borrowing of core household and family vocabulary. Therefore, the similarities in these basic words are considered a linguistic coincidence.\n\nHere is a comparison of the words:\n\n| Word | Korean | Hindi | Similarity Analysis |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Broom** | **빗자루 (bitjaru)** | **झाड़ू (jhāṛū)** | The second part of the Korean word, `jaru` (자루), is phonetically very similar to the Hindi word `jhāṛū`. Interestingly, this is a coincidence in meaning; the Korean `jaru` component means \"handle,\" while the Hindi word derives from a root for \"sweeping.\" |\n| **Mom** | **엄마 (eomma)** | **माँ (mā)** | Both words are nearly identical, built around the `m` sound and an open vowel. This type of \"mama\" sound is a common cross-linguistic phenomenon for maternal words. |\n| **Dad** | **아빠 (appa)** | **पापा (pāpā)** | These words are also highly similar. The use of a `p` or `b` sound for paternal words is, like \"mama,\" a widespread global occurrence. |\n\nDespite structural similarities in grammar, such as sentence order, the vocabulary of Korean and Hindi are entirely different. The alignment of these three specific words is a notable coincidence.\n\n<<<Korean and Hindi>>>"
