    "The A($\\alpha$)-stability of a numerical method refers to its stability region containing a wedge symmetric about the negative real axis with a half-angle $\\alpha$. For a linear multistep method, the stability region is determined by the roots of its stability polynomial. A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region $S$ contains the wedge $W_{\\alpha} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. The maximum angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangent from the origin to the boundary of the stability region.\n\nThe Backward Differentiation Formula of order 4 (BDF4) is a four-step implicit method used for solving stiff ordinary differential equations. It is not A-stable, but it is A($\\alpha$)-stable for a specific angle $\\alpha$. The boundary of the stability region for BDF methods is described by the set of complex numbers $z$ for which the characteristic polynomial $\\rho(\\zeta) - z\\sigma(\\zeta) = 0$ has roots on the unit circle, i.e., $|\\zeta|=1$. This boundary can be expressed as $z(\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j}(1-e^{-i\\theta})^j$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nTo find the angle $\\alpha$, one must find the point on this boundary curve in the upper-left quadrant where a line from the origin is tangent to the curve. The angle this tangent line makes with the negative real axis is $\\alpha$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum value of the argument of $z(\\theta)$ in the upper half-plane, let's call it $\\theta_{max}$, and then $\\alpha = \\pi - \\theta_{max}$. Thus, $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\tan(\\pi - \\theta_{max}) = -\\tan(\\theta_{max})$. If $z_0 = u_0 + iv_0$ is the point of tangency, then $\\tan(\\theta_{max}) = v_0/u_0$, and so $\\tan(\\alpha) = -v_0/u_0$.\n\nWhile the calculation is extensive, involving finding the extrema of the argument of the complex function $z(\\theta)$, the exact value has been derived in the literature. Notably, a paper by Gander and Wanner provides exact expressions for the stability angles of BDF methods. For BDF4, the exact value for the square of the tangent of the stability angle is given as:\n\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{9380+25\\sqrt{2033}}{1083}$.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is given by the arctangent of the square root of this expression.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9380+25\\sqrt{2033}}{1083}}\\right)$>>>The A($\\alpha$)-stability of a numerical method refers to its stability region containing a wedge symmetric about the negative real axis with a half-angle $\\alpha$.
