The value of the critical exponent ν is not fixed for a "G₄-theoretical framework", as this term is not standard. Assuming it refers to the widely studied φ⁴ theory, the value of ν depends on the spatial dimension *d* and the number of components of the order parameter *n*. For d ≥ 4, ν = 1/2. For the plausible interpretation of an O(4) model in d=3, the value is ν ≈ 0.748.
