In the CCSD method, in addition to the singly and doubly excited Slater determinants for which the matrix elements are zeroed by definition, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are also inherently zero for all quintuply, sextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the electronic Hamiltonian containing only one- and two-body interactions, which limits the connectivity in the diagrammatic expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}$. As a result, when $\bar{H}$ acts on the reference determinant $|\Phi\rangle$, it can only generate excitations up to quadruples. Therefore, the projection of $\bar{H}|\Phi\rangle$ onto any determinant with an excitation level of five or greater is identically zero.
