    "While a precise, direct equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" in modern French is not officially documented, an analysis of its components allows for a reasoned interpretation. The name is composed of two elements: \"Odo-\" and \"-beccus.\"\n\nThe second part, \"-beccus,\" is of known Gaulish origin, signifying \"beak.\" This word has survived in the French language as \"bec,\" which also means \"beak.\"\n\nThe first element, \"Odo-,\" is more ambiguous in a purely Gaulish context. It is widely recognized as a Germanic root meaning \"wealth,\" \"property,\" or \"riches.\" This root is found in historical Germanic names like *Audawakrs* (Odoacer) and is the origin of the name *Odo* or *Otto*. The French form of this Germanic name is *Eudes*. It is plausible that the \"Odo-\" in \"Odobeccus\" is a borrowing from a Germanic language, which was not uncommon at the time. Therefore, the name could be interpreted as a hybrid, meaning \"beak of wealth\" or \"rich beak\".\n\nThere is no scholarly consensus on a direct modern French equivalent for \"Odobeccus.\" One unsubstantiated suggestion of \"Sent-du-Bec,\" with an unlikely and unsupported meaning of \"bad breath,\" has been found, but this cannot be verified. The French word \"sent\" or \"sente\" derives from the Latin \"semita,\" meaning \"path,\" and has no clear connection to the meaning of \"Odo-\".\n\nGiven the components, the most faithful modern French rendering based on the etymological roots would be a compound name. Combining the French evolution of the two parts, one could theoretically construct a name like **Odebec** or **Eudes-Bec**. However, it is important to note that these are not established French names.\n\nIn conclusion, while the \"-beccus\" part of \"Odobeccus\" directly corresponds to the modern French \"bec,\" the \"Odo-\" part is likely of Germanic origin. A direct and historically attested French equivalent for \"Odobeccus\" does not appear to exist. The French form of the name *Odo* is *Eudes*.\n\n<<<There is no direct and confirmed French equivalent for the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\". However, based on the etymology of its parts, a hypothetical construction could be Odebec or Eudes-Bec.>>>"
