    "The maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, which is not a complete graph, is $12344$. This is determined by applying Brooks' Theorem and analyzing the properties of such a graph.\n\nA proper vertex coloring of a graph requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The minimum number of colors needed for a proper coloring is called the chromatic number, denoted as $\\chi(G)$.\n\nAccording to a fundamental result in graph theory known as Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$. In other words, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. The only exceptions are complete graphs and odd-length cycles, for which $\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nThe given graph $G$ has $12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. A graph with $12345$ vertices cannot be an odd cycle. Therefore, Brooks' Theorem applies, and the number of colors needed is at most the maximum degree of the graph, $\\Delta(G)$.\n\nTo find the maximum possible chromatic number, we must consider the highest possible maximum degree for a non-complete graph with $12345$ vertices. A complete graph on $n$ vertices, $K_n$, has a maximum degree of $n-1$. For our graph, if it were complete ($K_{12345}$), every vertex would have a degree of $12344$. Since $G$ is not a complete graph, at least one pair of vertices is not connected. However, a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices can still have a maximum degree of $n-1$.\n\nConsider a graph created by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge. Let's call this new graph $G'$.\n*   The original complete graph $K_{12345}$ has $\\Delta(K_{12345}) = 12344$.\n*   In the graph $G'$, the two vertices from the removed edge now have a degree of $12342$, but all other $12343$ vertices still have a degree of $12344$.\n*   Thus, the maximum degree of $G'$ is $\\Delta(G') = 12344$.\n\nSince $G'$ is not a complete graph and not an odd cycle, by Brooks' Theorem, $\\chi(G') \\le \\Delta(G') = 12344$.\n\nFurthermore, this specific graph $G'$ contains a complete subgraph (a clique) of size $12344$ (for instance, the set of all vertices excluding one of the two that had their degree reduced). A clique of size $k$ requires $k$ colors for a proper coloring. Therefore, the chromatic number of $G'$ must be at least $12344$.\n\nCombining these two facts, we have $\\chi(G') = 12344$. Since we have found a non-complete graph with $12345$ vertices that requires $12344$ colors, and we have shown that no such graph can require more than $12344$ colors, this is the maximum possible number of colors.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
