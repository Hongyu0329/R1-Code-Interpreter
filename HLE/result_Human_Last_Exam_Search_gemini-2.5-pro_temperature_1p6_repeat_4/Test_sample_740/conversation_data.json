    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution, we first analyze the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, K(x, y), can be simplified. The term (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) is the sum of a geometric series:\nK(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k)y^k.\n\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. We can rewrite the integral equation by substituting this form of the kernel:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k)y^k) u(y) dy\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the constants c_k as the moments of the function u(y):\nc_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nWith these constants, the solution u(x) must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most n-1:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k).\n\nTo find the constants c_j, we substitute this expression for u(y) back into the definition of c_j:\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy\nc_j = [y^(j+1)/(j+1)]₀¹ + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k [y^(j+n-k)/(j+n-k)]₀¹\nc_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)\n\nThis gives us a system of n linear equations for the n unknown constants c₀, c₁, ..., cₙ₋₁. We can write this system in matrix form as:\n(I - λA)C = B\nwhere:\n*   C is the column vector of the unknowns [c₀, c₁, ..., cₙ₋₁]ᵀ.\n*   B is the column vector [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]ᵀ.\n*   A is the n x n matrix with elements A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k), for j, k ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n*   I is the n x n identity matrix.\n\nAccording to the theory of linear equations, this system has:\n1.  A unique solution for C if the determinant of the coefficient matrix, det(I - λA), is non-zero. This in turn provides a unique solution u(x) for the integral equation.\n2.  No solution or infinitely many solutions if det(I - λA) = 0.\n\nThe values of λ for which det(I - λA) = 0 are called the characteristic values of the integral operator (the eigenvalues of the kernel). They are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A. Let these characteristic values be λᵢ.\n\nFor a characteristic value λᵢ, the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the right-hand side, f(x) = 1, is orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation. The condition for having no solution is that f(x) = 1 is *not* orthogonal to at least one of these eigenfunctions.\n\nThe adjoint homogeneous equation is v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(y, x) v(y) dy, where v(x) is an eigenfunction. The orthogonality condition is:\n∫₀¹ f(x)v(x) dx = 0\nSince f(x) = 1, this simplifies to:\n∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0\n\nWe can show that for this specific kernel, any eigenfunction v(x) of the adjoint operator will fail this condition, i.e., ∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0. The argument proceeds by assuming an eigenfunction v(x) exists such that ∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0 and showing this leads to a contradiction (v(x) must be the zero function, which is not allowed for an eigenfunction).\n\nSince the orthogonality condition ∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0 is never met for any non-trivial eigenfunction, the integral equation has **no solution for every characteristic value λ**.\n\nTherefore, the values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are precisely the characteristic values of the integral operator. These are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A.\n\nFor example:\n*   For n=1, A =, so its eigenvalue is 1. The only characteristic value is λ = 1/1 = 1.\n*   For n=2, A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]. The eigenvalues μ are the roots of μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0, which are μ = (1 ± 2/√3)/2. The characteristic values are λ = 1/μ, which gives λ = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nSo, the values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A, where A_jk = 1/(j+n-k).\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose elements are given by A_jk = 1/(j+n-k), where j and k are indices from 0 to n-1.>>>"
