    "After a thorough analysis, it appears there is no valid solution for the intermediate step under the standard interpretation of elementary cellular automata (ECA) with periodic (wraparound) boundaries. A brute-force search across all 256 possible ECA rules does not yield a result where applying the same rule to the initial sequence and then to the intermediate sequence produces the final sequence.\n\nA similar search using fixed-zero boundaries, another common convention, also fails to produce a valid solution.\n\nThis suggests a likely error in the problem statement itself, specifically with the provided initial or final sequences. Without a valid rule that connects the two given states over two generations, it is impossible to determine the intermediate step. Any attempt to provide a sequence would be speculative.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and standard ECA conventions, a valid intermediate step cannot be determined.\n\n<<<No valid solution exists under standard elementary cellular automaton rules.>>>"
