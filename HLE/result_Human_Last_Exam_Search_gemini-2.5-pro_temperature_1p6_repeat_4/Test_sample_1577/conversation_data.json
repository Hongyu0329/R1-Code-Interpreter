    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is a fundamental property that depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a closed, orientable surface of genus *g* (like a torus with *g* handles), the GSD is 4<sup>g</sup>, which is equivalent to 2<sup>2g</sup>. This degeneracy arises from the existence of non-trivial loops (logical operators) that can wrap around the handles of the surface.\n\nWhen boundaries or \"holes\" are introduced, the situation changes. The toric code can support different types of gapped boundaries, with the two most common being \"smooth\" (also called closed or e-condensed) and \"rough\" (also called open or m-condensed). At a smooth boundary, electric charge (e-anyon) excitations can condense and be annihilated, while at a rough boundary, magnetic flux (m-anyon) excitations can condense.\n\nThe introduction of holes provides additional non-trivial cycles around which logical operators can be defined, thus increasing the ground state degeneracy. In the context of the surface code, which is a version of the toric code on a planar surface (genus *g*=0) with boundaries, each hole that is \"punched\" into the surface effectively adds one logical qubit to the system.\n\nLet's consider a surface with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes. Each of these *n+m* holes introduces a new, independent way to store quantum information. A logical qubit requires two anti-commuting logical operators (like X and Z). For each hole, one can define a logical operator that loops around the hole and another that runs from the hole to an outer boundary of the appropriate type.\n\nThe total number of logical qubits, *k*, that can be encoded in a system with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes is the sum of the qubits from each hole, so *k = n + m*.\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is given by 2<sup>k</sup>. Therefore, for a system with *n* smooth and *m* rough holes, the GSD is 2<sup>(n+m)</sup>.\n\nThis can also be derived more formally. The number of logical qubits *k* on a surface of genus *g* with a total of *b* boundaries is given by *k = 2g + b - 1*. For a plane (genus 0) into which we introduce *n* smooth and *m* rough holes, we create *n+m* inner boundaries. There is also an implicit outer boundary for the plane. This gives a total of *b = n + m + 1* boundaries. However, this simple formula doesn't account for the different boundary types. A more careful analysis considering the types of boundaries and the logical operators they support shows that the number of logical qubits is *k = 2g + n + m* when there is an outer boundary that can terminate strings from all inner boundaries. For a plane (*g*=0), this yields *k=n+m*.\n\nThus, the ground space degeneracy is 2<sup>(n+m)</sup>.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA. 2^(m+n) - This matches our derivation.\nB. 2^(m+n-2) - Incorrect.\nC. 2^(m+n+2) - Incorrect.\nD. 2^(2m) - Incorrect.\nE. 2^(2n) - Incorrect.\nF. 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n) - This gives 2^(m+n) only when both m and n are non-zero, and is incorrect otherwise.\n\n<<<A>>>"
