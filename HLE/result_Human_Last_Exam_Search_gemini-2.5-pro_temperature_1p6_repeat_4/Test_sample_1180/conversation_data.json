    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, we first need to find a suitable model of the curve and analyze its reduction. The given valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$, which is the standard 2-adic valuation.\n\nLet the curve be $C$. The equation is defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and we are interested in its reduction over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The equation is $z^2 - (2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1) = 0$.\nThe reduction of this equation modulo 2 gives $z^2 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, which is $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This shows that the special fiber of this model is a non-reduced scheme.\n\nTo analyze the stable reduction, it is often helpful to transform the curve into a standard Weierstrass form. We can homogenize the equation and look at the point at infinity. Let $x = u/w$ and $z = v/w^3$. This is a standard transformation for a curve of genus 2.\nSubstituting these into the equation gives:\n$(\\frac{v}{w^3})^2 = 2(\\frac{u}{w})^5 + 2(\\frac{u}{w})^3 + 1$\nMultiplying by $w^6$ to clear denominators, we get:\n$v^2 = 2uw^5 + 2u^3w^3 + w^6$\nBy setting $w=1$, we get an affine model $v^2 = 2u + 2u^3 + u^6$.\nLet's rewrite this in a more standard form by renaming variables, say $y^2 = x^6 + 2x^3 + 2x$. Let $f(x) = x^6 + 2x^3 + 2x$. This is the equation of a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor(6-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2=f(x)$ is determined by the clustering of the roots of $f(x)$ under the 2-adic valuation.\nLet's find the roots of $f(x) = x(x^5 + 2x^2 + 2) = 0$.\nOne root is $x_1 = 0$.\nThe other five roots are the roots of the polynomial $g(x) = x^5 + 2x^2 + 2$. To find the 2-adic valuations of these roots, we can use the Newton polygon method for the prime $p=2$.\nThe vertices of the Newton polygon of $g(x)$ are determined by the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$. The coefficients are $a_5=1, a_2=2, a_0=2$. The points are:\n*   $(5, v(1)) = (5, 0)$\n*   $(2, v(2)) = (2, 1)$\n*   $(0, v(2)) = (0, 1)$\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of a single segment connecting $(0, 1)$ and $(5, 0)$. The slope of this segment is $\\frac{0-1}{5-0} = -1/5$.\nThe length of the projection of this segment onto the x-axis is 5. This means there are 5 roots, and the valuation of each of these roots is $-(\\text{slope}) = 1/5$.\n\nSo, the roots of $f(x)$ are partitioned into two clusters based on their valuation:\n*   Cluster 1: $S_1 = \\{0\\}$.\n*   Cluster 2: $S_2 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6\\}$, the five roots of $g(x)=0$, each with valuation $v(x_i) = 1/5$.\n\nThe special fiber of the stable model will have components corresponding to these clusters. Since there are two clusters, they will intersect at a double point. The thickness of this double point is a measure of the arithmetic complexity of the singularity. For hyperelliptic curves, this thickness is often related to the resultant of the polynomials defining the clusters of roots.\n\nThe polynomial for the first cluster is $f_1(x) = x$.\nThe polynomial for the second cluster is $f_2(x) = x^5 + 2x^2 + 2$.\nThe resultant of these two polynomials is given by $\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2) = f_2(0)$.\n$\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2) = 0^5 + 2(0)^2 + 2 = 2$.\n\nThe valuation of the resultant is $v(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2)) = v(2)$. Since the valuation is normalized to $v(2)=1$, we have $v(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2)) = 1$.\nIn many contexts, particularly for odd residue characteristic, the thickness of the double point is exactly the valuation of this resultant. While the theory for residue characteristic 2 is more complex, this value provides a strong and plausible candidate. The thickness is, by definition, an integer.\n\nThe thickness of the double point corresponds to $v(c)$ where the local ring at the singularity is of the form $R[[x,y]]/(xy-c)$. The valuation $v(\\text{Res}(f_1,f_2))$ represents the \"arithmetic distance\" between the two sets of roots and directly relates to this value $c$. A thickness of 1 implies that the components of the stable model intersect transversally.\n\nTherefore, the thickness of the double point is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
