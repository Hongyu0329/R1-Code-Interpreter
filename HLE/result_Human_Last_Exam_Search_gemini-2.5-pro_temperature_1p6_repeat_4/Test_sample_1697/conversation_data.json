    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**\n\nThe substrate is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs) on the benzene ring:\n*   A tertiary amide group (-CONEt2) at position 1.\n*   A tertiary amine group (-NMe2) at position 3.\n\nBoth of these groups are capable of directing the deprotonation of an adjacent (ortho) proton by a strong base. The reagent used is sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), a very strong organolithium base, in the presence of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). TMEDA complexes with the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the sec-BuLi and facilitating the deprotonation.\n\nThe regioselectivity of the deprotonation is determined by the directing ability of the two groups.\n*   The N,N-diethylamide group is one of the most powerful DMGs. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions (C-2 and C-6).\n*   The N,N-dimethylamino group is also a strong DMG, directing deprotonation to its ortho positions (C-2 and C-4).\n\nThe proton at the C-2 position is ortho to both the amide and the amino group. This phenomenon is known as cooperative metalation, where 1,3-related DMGs promote lithiation at their common ortho position (C-2). The synergistic effect of both groups makes the proton at C-2 the most acidic and therefore the most likely to be removed by the sec-BuLi. The deprotonation thus occurs regioselectively at this position, forming a lithiated intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n\nThe resulting aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. It reacts with methyl iodide (CH3I), which is an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbanion at C-2 attacks the methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n**Product**\n\nThe final product obtained after these two steps is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
