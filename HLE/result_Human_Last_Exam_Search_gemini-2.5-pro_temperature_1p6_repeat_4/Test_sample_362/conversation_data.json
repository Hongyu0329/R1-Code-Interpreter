    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a phosphonium ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. In this specific case, the reactants are pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane.\n\n**Reactants:**\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde** (2,2-dimethylpropanal): This is an aldehyde with a bulky tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane:** This is the Wittig reagent (ylide). The \"ethylidene\" part indicates a two-carbon chain double-bonded to the triphenylphosphine group (P(Ph₃)). A 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to the second carbon of this chain. Its structure is (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\n**Reaction Mechanism:**\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group and the triphenylphosphine group of the ylide are exchanged. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon double bond at the location of the original carbonyl group, producing an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide ((C₆H₅)₃P=O) as a byproduct.\n\nThe reaction proceeds through a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to yield the final products.\n\n**Product:**\n\nThe reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane results in the formation of **5-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dimethylpent-3-ene**.\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n\n```\n      Cl\n     /\n  (C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=CH-C(CH₃)₃\n```\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting double bond (whether it is E or Z) depends on the nature of the ylide.\n\n*   **Unstabilized ylides** (where the carbon of the ylide is attached to alkyl groups) generally favor the formation of the *Z*-alkene (cis).\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (where the ylide carbon is attached to electron-withdrawing groups like esters or ketones) typically lead to the *E*-alkene (trans).\n\nThe ylide in this question, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, is considered an unstabilized ylide because the carbon double-bonded to phosphorus is attached to an alkyl chain. Therefore, the reaction would be expected to predominantly yield the *Z*-isomer, although a mixture of *E* and *Z* isomers is common. The bulky pivalaldehyde could also influence the stereochemical outcome.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{5-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dimethylpent-3-ene}}$."
