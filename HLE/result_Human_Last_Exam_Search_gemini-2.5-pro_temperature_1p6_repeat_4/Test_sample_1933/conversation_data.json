    "The VC dimension of the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with a schema $S$ containing 4 unary predicates is 4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Logic and Concepts\nThe logic in question, $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, allows for formulas built from 4 unary predicates (let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$) using existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the logical constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). We are interested in the complexity of the sets definable by formulas in this logic that have one free variable, say $x$. These definable sets are the \"concepts\" in our concept class.\n\n### 2. Characterizing the Definable Sets\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic with one free variable $x$ can be shown to be equivalent to a simpler form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv C(x) \\land \\Psi$\nHere, $C(x)$ is a conjunction of the atomic predicates applied to the free variable $x$ (e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$), and $\\Psi$ is a sentence, which is a formula with no free variables.\n\nFor any given model (or database instance) $M$, the sentence $\\Psi$ is either true or false.\n*   If $\\Psi$ is true in $M$, the set of elements satisfying $\\phi(x)$ is the same as the set satisfying $C(x)$.\n*   If $\\Psi$ is false in $M$, then $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, and it defines the empty set.\n\nThe set of concepts defined purely by the conjunctions $C(x)$ forms a base class. These are intersections of the extensions of the four predicates. Let's call the set of concepts defined by these conjunctions in a model $M$ as $\\mathcal{C}_0^M$. The full class of concepts definable in $M$, denoted $\\mathcal{H}_M$, is a subset of $\\mathcal{C}_0^M \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$. Since the empty set can be defined (e.g., using a formula with $\\bot$), $\\mathcal{H}_M$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{C}_0^M$. In fact, it can be shown that $\\mathcal{H}_M = \\mathcal{C}_0^M$.\n\n### 3. The VC Dimension of Intersections of Sets\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the supremum of the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_0^M$ over all possible models $M$. The class $\\mathcal{C}_0^M$ consists of all possible intersections of the four base sets (the extensions of $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ in the model $M$).\n\nIt is a standard result in computational learning theory that a concept class formed by the intersections of $k$ base sets has a VC dimension of at most $k$. In our case, $k=4$. This can be shown by noting that there are at most $2^k$ distinct concepts of this form. To shatter a set of size $d$, one needs to realize all $2^d$ of its subsets. This implies that $2^d \\le 2^k$, and therefore $d \\le k$. For our problem, this means the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### 4. Establishing the Lower Bound\nTo show that the VC dimension is exactly 4, we must demonstrate that a VC dimension of 4 is achievable. This requires constructing a model $M$ and a set of 4 points that can be shattered by the concept class.\n\nLet the set of points be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We define the extensions of the four predicates on these points as follows:\n*   $P_1 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_2 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_3 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nWith this construction, for any subset of points from $X$, we can find a corresponding concept (an intersection of some of the $P_i$) that isolates exactly that subset. For instance:\n*   To get the singleton set $\\{x_1\\}$, we can take the intersection $P_2 \\cap P_3 \\cap P_4$.\n*   To get the set $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$, we can take the intersection $P_3 \\cap P_4$.\n*   To get the empty set, we can take the intersection $P_1 \\cap P_2 \\cap P_3 \\cap P_4$.\n\nThis demonstrates that the set $X$ is shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension for this specific model is at least 4.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nSince the VC dimension is at most 4 for any model, and we have constructed a model where the VC dimension is at least 4, the supremum of the VC dimension over all models is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
