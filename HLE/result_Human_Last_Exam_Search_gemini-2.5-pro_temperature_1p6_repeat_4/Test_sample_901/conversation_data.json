    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The product of this reaction is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\nFirst, it is necessary to identify the stereoisomer of the starting material. The (1S,2R) designation refers to the *trans* isomer, where the bromine atom and the methyl group are on opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe E2 elimination mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the hydrogen atom to be removed and the leaving group (in this case, bromine) must be in an anti-periplanar, or trans-diaxial, position. This means both the hydrogen and the bromine must be in axial positions, on opposite faces of the ring.\n\nFor the *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane molecule, the most stable chair conformation has both the bulky bromine and methyl groups in equatorial positions. However, for the E2 reaction to occur, the bromine must be in an axial position. This requires the molecule to adopt a less stable chair conformation, where both the bromine and the methyl group are in axial positions.\n\nIn this reactive, diaxial conformation:\n*   The bromine atom is axial at carbon 1.\n*   The methyl group is axial at carbon 2, which means the hydrogen atom on carbon 2 is in an equatorial position.\n*   The hydrogen atoms on carbon 6 are in axial and equatorial positions.\n\nThe reaction can proceed by removing a beta-hydrogen from either carbon 2 or carbon 6.\n*   **Elimination at Carbon 2:** This would lead to the more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene. However, this requires the removal of the hydrogen on carbon 2. Since this hydrogen is in an equatorial position, it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination to form the Zaitsev product cannot occur.\n*   **Elimination at Carbon 6:** This would lead to the less substituted Hofmann product, 3-methylcyclohexene. The axial hydrogen on carbon 6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, can abstract this proton.\n\nDue to these stereochemical constraints, the reaction is forced to follow the path that is geometrically possible, even though it leads to the thermodynamically less stable alkene. The major product of the reaction is therefore determined by the required anti-periplanar arrangement for the E2 mechanism.\n\nThus, the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide yields 3-methylcyclohexene as the major product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
