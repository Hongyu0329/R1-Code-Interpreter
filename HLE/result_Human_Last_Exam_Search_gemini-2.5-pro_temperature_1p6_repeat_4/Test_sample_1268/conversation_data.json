    "An upper bound for the maximum norm of certain automorphic forms in relation to the covolume of the underlying space has been a subject of significant research in number theory. When considering a squarefree natural number $N$, this typically refers to the level of a congruence subgroup, and the automorphic forms are often Hecke-Maass cusp forms on the quotient space.\n\nAssuming that the \"maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\" refers to the sup-norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm) of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$, denoted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, and \"$V$\" is the covolume of the modular curve $X_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, we can establish a relationship.\n\nThe covolume $V$ of $X_0(N)$ is given by the formula:\n$V = \\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}) = [\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] \\cdot \\text{vol}(\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})\\backslash\\mathbb{H})$\nThe index of $\\Gamma_0(N)$ in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is $N \\prod_{p|N}(1+1/p)$. With the volume of the fundamental domain for $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ being $\\pi/3$, the covolume is $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N}(1 + \\frac{1}{p})$. For a squarefree number $N$, the covolume $V$ is directly proportional to $N$, i.e., $V \\asymp N$.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on establishing upper bounds for the sup-norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ for a Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of level $N$ with a fixed Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and normalized so that $\\|f\\|_2=1$. For the specific case where the level $N$ is a squarefree integer, researchers have achieved bounds that show the maximum norm decreases as the covolume (and thus the level $N$) increases.\n\nAccording to research by Gergely Harcos and Nicolas Templier, a notable upper bound for the sup-norm of such a form is:\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$\nfor any $\\epsilon > 0$, where the implied constant depends on the Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$. This bound was an improvement on previous results in this area.\n\nBy substituting the relationship $V \\asymp N$, this upper bound can be expressed in terms of the covolume $V$:\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis inequality demonstrates that as the volume of the space grows, the maximum value that the automorphic form can attain is bounded and, in fact, tends to decrease. This phenomenon is a key result in the field of quantum chaos and the analytic theory of automorphic forms.\n\n<<<For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ with a fixed eigenvalue, the upper bound for its maximum norm, denoted here as $k_{k,\\infty}$ (interpreted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$), in relation to the covolume $V$ for a squarefree level $N$, is given by $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$.>>>"
