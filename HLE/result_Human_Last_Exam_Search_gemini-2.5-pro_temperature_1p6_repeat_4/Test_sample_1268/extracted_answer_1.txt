For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ with a fixed eigenvalue, the upper bound for its maximum norm, denoted here as $k_{k,\infty}$ (interpreted as $\|f\|_\infty$), in relation to the covolume $V$ for a squarefree level $N$, is given by $\|f\|_\infty \ll_{\lambda, \epsilon} V^{-1/6+\epsilon}$.
