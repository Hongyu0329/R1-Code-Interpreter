    "Determining the absolute \"worst\" suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game with a 2.5x raise is a matter of consulting Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening ranges. While the most precise GTO strategies involve mixed frequencies (i.e., opening a hand a certain percentage of the time), simplified or \"implementable\" GTO charts provide a solid baseline for which hands are considered standard opens and which are folds.\n\nIn a rake-free environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is higher, leading to wider opening ranges compared to raked games. The button is the most profitable position to open from, allowing for the widest range of hands.\n\nBased on commonly accepted GTO-based charts for 100bb cash games, the weakest suited jacks are opened with decreasing frequency. A baseline recommendation for a button opening range often includes hands down to J6s. This means that hands like J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s are typically considered folds, even from this advantageous position.\n\nTherefore, the worst or weakest suited jack that should be opened as part of a standard, simplified GTO strategy is J6s. Any suited jack weaker than this would generally be considered a fold.\n\n<<<J6s>>>"
