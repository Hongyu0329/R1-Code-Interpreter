    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Battle of Huj**, which took place on **November 8, 1917**.\n\nThe painting is titled ***The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj***. This engagement was one of the last great cavalry charges in the history of the British Army and occurred during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. The charge was made against Turkish artillery positions.\n\nOther late historical battles painted by Lady Butler include:\n*   ***The Retreat from Mons***, depicting the battle on August 23, 1914.\n*   A watercolour of the London Irish Rifles at the **Battle of Loos** in September 1915.\n*   ***The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia***, showing the battle on February 26, 1916.\n*   A work depicting the **Action at Rafa** on January 9, 1917, which involved the Imperial Camel Corps.\n\nHowever, the Battle of Huj in November 1917 remains the latest of these depicted events. Her more famous works often portray earlier conflicts such as the Napoleonic Wars (e.g., *Scotland Forever!* depicting the Battle of Waterloo in 1815), the Crimean War (e.g., *The Roll Call* and *Balaclava* from 1854), and the Anglo-Zulu War (e.g., *The Defence of Rorke's Drift* in 1879).\n\n<<<The Battle of Huj>>>"
