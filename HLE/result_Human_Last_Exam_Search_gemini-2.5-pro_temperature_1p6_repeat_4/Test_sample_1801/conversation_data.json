    "Two Nobel laureates were associated with Enron, the energy-trading company that launched an infamous \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign in 2000 before its collapse. While their connections to the company are documented, there is no definitive evidence they were featured in the television commercials.\n\nThe two Nobel laureates linked to Enron are:\n\n*   **Paul Krugman**, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. Krugman served on an advisory board for Enron in 1999. He has stated that he was paid for his role on this panel.\n\n*   **Merton Miller**, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990. Miller's work on financial economics and corporate finance, particularly his theories on derivatives, was frequently referenced in the context of Enron's business model.\n\nWhile these two laureates had connections to Enron, searches for their appearance in the \"Ask Why\" commercials have not yielded any direct evidence. One uncorroborated source suggests that Nobel laureate and physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** was featured in one of the commercials.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign itself was a major marketing effort by Enron in the period leading up to its eventual bankruptcy in 2001.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
