    "## The Quantity of Negative Fundamental Discriminants with Class Number 48 Revealed\n\nIn the realm of number theory, specifically concerning the Gauss class number problem, it has been determined that there are **154** negative fundamental discriminants that possess a class number of 48. This result is a component of the broader effort to classify imaginary quadratic fields by their class numbers.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in essence, seeks to provide a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for each class number. A fundamental discriminant is an integer that is the discriminant of a quadratic number field. For negative fundamental discriminants, this problem is equivalent to finding all such discriminants corresponding to a given class number.\n\nThe comprehensive classification for class numbers up to 100 was notably completed by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" published in *Mathematics of Computation*. This work stands as a significant computational achievement in the field. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) sequence A046125, which catalogues the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number, confirms this count, citing Watkins' paper as a primary source.\n\nThe determination of this number is part of a long-standing mathematical endeavor that has seen contributions from many mathematicians over the decades. While the problem for small class numbers was resolved earlier, Watkins' work provided a complete list for all class numbers up to 100, including the 154 instances for class number 48.\n\n<<<154>>>"
