    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself, is **G**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how this is determined:\n\n1.  **The Color Combination:** The color produced by combining yellow and blue is green. Therefore, the question is asking for the musical note that corresponds to the range between green and blue.\n\n2.  **Newton's Musical Scale:** Isaac Newton associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the notes of a musical scale. He specifically used the Dorian mode starting on the note D. The notes in the D Dorian scale are D, E, F, G, A, B, C.\n\n3.  **Color and Note Correspondence:** Newton aligned the colors of the spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—with the notes of the D Dorian scale. While different interpretations exist, a consistent mapping arises from Newton's own writings in *Opticks*. The primary colors of red, yellow, and blue are aligned with the notes that form the primary triad of the D scale: D, F, and A, respectively.\n\n    This establishes the following correspondence:\n    *   **Red** corresponds to **D**\n    *   Orange corresponds to E\n    *   **Yellow** corresponds to **F**\n    *   **Green** corresponds to **G**\n    *   **Blue** corresponds to **A**\n    *   Indigo corresponds to B\n    *   Violet corresponds to C\n\n4.  **Identifying the Note:** The range in question is between green and blue. Based on the established correspondence, the color green is associated with the musical note G.\n\nTherefore, the musical note corresponding to the beginning of the specified range on Newton's color circle is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
