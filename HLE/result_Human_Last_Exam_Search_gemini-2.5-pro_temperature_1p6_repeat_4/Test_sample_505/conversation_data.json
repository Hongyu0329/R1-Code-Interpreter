    "In a surface code architecture, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface, specifically the number of holes or boundaries. Since the two patches of surface code are independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each patch.\n\nFor a single planar patch of surface code, introducing holes allows for the encoding of more logical qubits. A single patch with *n* holes can encode *n* logical qubits. Therefore, one patch of surface code with two holes can encode two logical qubits.\n\nGiven that there are two such identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is calculated as follows:\n*   **Logical qubits per patch:** A single patch with two \"closed\" holes can encode two logical qubits.\n*   **Total logical qubits:** With two independent patches, the total capacity is the sum of the qubits from each, which is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, a maximum of four logical qubits can be encoded in two patches of surface code, with each patch having two holes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
