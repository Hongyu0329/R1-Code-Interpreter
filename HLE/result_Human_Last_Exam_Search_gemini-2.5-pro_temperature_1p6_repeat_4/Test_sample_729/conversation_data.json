    "A power subgroup is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by the powers of a single element. The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, is a non-abelian group with a specific structure. To determine the number of its power subgroups, we need to find the number of its distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe structure of Q_128 is defined by the presentation:\n⟨a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹⟩.\n\nThe elements of Q_128 can be divided into two categories:\n1.  Powers of the element 'a'.\n2.  Elements of the form aⁱx.\n\nFirst, consider the cyclic subgroup generated by 'a', which is `<a>`. This subgroup is cyclic of order 64. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order 'n' is equal to the number of divisors of 'n' (τ(n)). For `<a>`, with an order of 64 (or 2⁶), the number of divisors is 6 + 1 = 7. These seven subgroups are all cyclic.\n\nNext, consider the elements of the form aⁱx, where 'i' ranges from 0 to 63. There are 64 such elements. The order of any of these elements is 4. This is because (aⁱx)² = aⁱxaⁱx = aⁱ(xaⁱx⁻¹)x² = aⁱ(a⁻¹)x² = x² = a³², and therefore (aⁱx)⁴ = (a³²)² = a⁶⁴ = 1.\n\nEach of these 64 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators (φ(4) = 2). The two generators of the subgroup `<aⁱx>` are aⁱx and (aⁱx)³ = a³²⁺ⁱx. This means that the elements aⁱx and a³²⁺ⁱx generate the same cyclic subgroup. Consequently, the 64 elements of this form generate 64 / 2 = 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from the subgroups of `<a>` because they contain elements not found in `<a>`. Therefore, to find the total number of power subgroups, we sum the number of cyclic subgroups from both categories.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = (Subgroups from `<a>`) + (Subgroups from elements of the form aⁱx)\nTotal = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nThus, the generalized quaternion group of size 128 has 39 power subgroups.\n\n<<<39>>>"
