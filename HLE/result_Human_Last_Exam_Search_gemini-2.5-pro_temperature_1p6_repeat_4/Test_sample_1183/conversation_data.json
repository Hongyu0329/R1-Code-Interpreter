    "The molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is known as 1,6,11-triethynyl-tribenzo[a,c,e]cyclononatriene. Visualizing the 3D structure of this molecule reveals its symmetry elements.\n\nThe molecule has a three-fold rotational symmetry axis (C₃) that passes through the center of the central nine-membered ring. This is the principal axis of rotation. When the molecule is rotated by 120 degrees around this axis, it remains unchanged.\n\nThe molecule also possesses three two-fold rotational axes (C₂) that are perpendicular to the principal C₃ axis. These C₂ axes pass through the central ring and bisect the bonds connecting the benzene rings.\n\nBecause the molecule has a principal C₃ axis and three perpendicular C₂ axes, its point group is D₃. The D₃ point group does not contain a horizontal mirror plane (σh), vertical mirror planes (σv), or an inversion center (i). The molecule's propeller-like shape is chiral due to the twist of the benzene rings, which is consistent with the D₃ point group.\n\n<<<D₃>>>"
