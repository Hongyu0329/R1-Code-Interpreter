Based on the available research, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes catalytic performance for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, a lower nickel content in the range of 7-12.5 wt% is generally preferred. For water splitting, a much higher nickel content, in the range of a 50-75% atomic ratio of Ni, appears to be optimal.
