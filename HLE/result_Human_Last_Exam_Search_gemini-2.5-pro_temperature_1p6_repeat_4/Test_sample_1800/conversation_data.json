    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is crucial for maximizing their catalytic performance. However, research indicates that the optimal ratio is not the same for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS), but rather is specific to each application.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction: A Lower Nickel Content is Preferred\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which is essential for producing high-purity hydrogen, studies suggest that a lower concentration of nickel is more effective. Research on the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction has identified an optimal nickel proportion of approximately 7% molar. In high-temperature WGS reactions, catalyst performance has been shown to increase with nickel loading in the range of 1% to 8% by weight.\n\nFurther investigations into Ni/CeO2 catalysts with nickel content varying from 5 to 12.5 wt% revealed that catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% nickel loading achieved higher CO conversion. Additionally, maintaining a low coverage of nickel on the ceria support is advantageous as it helps to suppress the undesired side reaction of CO methanation.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS): A Higher Nickel Ratio Shows More Promise\n\nIn contrast to the WGS reaction, a significantly higher nickel content appears to be beneficial for water splitting, particularly for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), which is a key step in the process.\n\nA computational study has indicated that Ni-Ceria nanoparticles with a 3Ni/1Ce ratio, corresponding to a 75% atomic concentration of nickel, exhibit favorable properties for the water-splitting reaction. This is supported by experimental work on a series of Ni_yCe_{100âˆ’y}O_x electrocatalysts, which found that catalysts with Ni:Ce atomic ratios of 75:25 and 50:50 (Ni75Ce25Ox and Ni50Ce50Ox) demonstrated superior OER activities. Another study involving co-doping with iron and nickel showed that a (10 + 10) mol% Ni + Fe co-doped CeO2 catalyst had excellent performance in both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for both the Water Gas Shift reaction and water splitting.\n\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, a lower nickel content, in the range of **7-12.5 wt%**, is generally favored to enhance CO conversion while minimizing methane by-production.\n\n*   For **water splitting**, a much higher nickel content, around a **3:1 to 1:1 atomic ratio of Ni to Ce (50-75 at% Ni)**, is ideal for maximizing the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction.\n\nTherefore, the choice of the Ni/Ce ratio must be tailored to the specific catalytic application.\n\n<<<Based on the available research, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes catalytic performance for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, a lower nickel content in the range of 7-12.5 wt% is generally preferred. For water splitting, a much higher nickel content, in the range of a 50-75% atomic ratio of Ni, appears to be optimal.>>>"
