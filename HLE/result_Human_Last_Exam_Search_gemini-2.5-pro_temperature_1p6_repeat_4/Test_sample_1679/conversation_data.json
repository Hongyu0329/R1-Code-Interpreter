    "**An American in Paris (1951)** is the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film, which won the top prize at the 24th Academy Awards, includes a famous and lengthy ballet sequence that depicts stylized versions of Parisian landmarks.\n\nThe one in Paris is one of two ancient Egyptian obelisks that were originally erected at the Luxor Temple. The second remains in Egypt, while the other was transported to the Place de la Concorde in Paris in the 1830s.\n\nThe film's celebrated 17-minute ballet finale, inspired by the works of French painters, features a scene set in a recreation of the Place de la Concorde. This sequence showcases the fountains of the square, and analysis of the film's production and artistic choices confirms that the setting is indeed the Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is the central monument. One description of the ballet explicitly notes that in the recreation of the square, the obelisk was installed in the place of the guillotine. Though the film was shot almost entirely on Hollywood soundstages, a model of the Place de la Concorde fountain was created for the production, which was designed in the style of French Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy. A still from the film shows Gene Kelly on a set that strongly suggests the Place de la Concorde.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) and *Gigi* (1958), are also set in Paris, there is no evidence that the earlier film depicts the landmark. *Gigi* does feature the Place de la Concorde but was released seven years after *An American in Paris*. The 1956 Best Picture winner, *Around the World in 80 Days*, begins its journey in Paris, but the scenes were filmed on a studio backlot with no indication of the Place de la Concorde being shown.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
