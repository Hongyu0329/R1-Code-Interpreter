To address the autoinhibitory effect of the negatively charged patch (S-E-E-D) at positions 47-50, the best replacement strategy is to mutate all four residues to Alanine. This would involve creating a quadruple mutant: S47A, E48A, E49A, and D50A. This approach eliminates the negative charges from the Glutamate and Aspartate residues and removes the phosphorylation potential of the Serine residue, thereby neutralizing the entire patch with minimal structural disruption.
