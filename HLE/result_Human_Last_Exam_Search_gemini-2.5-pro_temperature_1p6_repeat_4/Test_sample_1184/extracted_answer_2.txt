The interaction between the human voltage-gated calcium channel 2.3's alpha-1 and beta-1 subunits is a multifaceted process involving distinct domains of the beta-1 subunit. The primary site of physical interaction is the Alpha Binding Pocket (ABP), a hydrophobic groove within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit, which binds to the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit. While a specific list of hotspot residues for the human beta-1 subunit is not exhaustively defined, it is understood that the hydrophobic nature of this pocket is key, with critical residues likely being homologous to those identified in other beta-subunits, such as four key leucine residues in the highly similar CavÎ²3 subunit. The fine-tuning of the alpha-1 subunit's gating properties, however, is more complex and involves several regions of the beta-1 subunit. The GK domain is the minimal unit necessary for this modulation, exerting its effect upon binding to the AID. In addition, the N-terminus of the beta-1 subunit plays a crucial role in determining the rate of voltage-dependent inactivation, with its length being a critical factor. The HOOK domain, a flexible linker region, also contributes significantly to the modulation of inactivation. A specific mutation in the human beta-1a subunit's HOOK domain, V156A, has been shown to cause calcium dysregulation, underscoring its functional importance. Finally, the intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains is essential for the full modulatory capacity of the beta-1 subunit. Consequently, hotspots for the fine-tuning of gating are not confined to a single location but are distributed throughout the N-terminus, SH3, HOOK, and GK domains of the human beta-1 subunit.
