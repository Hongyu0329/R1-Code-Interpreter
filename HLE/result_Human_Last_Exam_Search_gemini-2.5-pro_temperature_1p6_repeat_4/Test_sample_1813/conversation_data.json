    "The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is associated with the rational number (or slope) `p/q`. The computation of \\( m_{p/q} \\) and its associated continued fraction is deeply connected to the continued fraction of `p/q` itself, as well as to constructs known as Christoffel words and snake graphs.\n\nThe procedure to find the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{p/q} \\) involves several steps.\n\n1.  **Compute the continued fraction of the rational number `p/q`**.\n    For the given rational number `4/7`, we use the Euclidean algorithm to find its continued fraction expansion:\n    \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n    \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n    \\( \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\)\n    So, \\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\). This is represented as `[0; 1, 1, 3]`.\n    For the formulas that relate to the structure of the Markov continued fractions, it is often necessary to have a continued fraction representation of even length. Any finite continued fraction ending with an integer `a_n > 1` can be rewritten as one ending in `a_n - 1, 1`.\n    So, `[0; 1, 1, 3]` can be written as `[0; 1, 1, 2, 1]`. Let the coefficients be \\( a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=2, a_4=1 \\). The length of this expansion is `n=4` (even).\n\n2.  **Construct the continued fraction for the Markov number**.\n    There are rules described in the literature (e.g., in works by Aigner, Cohn, Perrine, and more recently by Button) that construct the palindromic continued fraction whose numerator is the Markov number `m_{p/q}`. One such rule, for a rational `p/q` with an even length continued fraction `[0; a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`, constructs the new continued fraction as `[2, W_1, 2, W_2, ..., 2, W_{n-1}, 2]`, where each `W_i` is a sequence of ones of length `a_i - 1`.\n\n    Applying this rule to `4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 2, 1]`:\n    *   For `a_1 = 1`, the sequence of ones is empty (`1-1=0`).\n    *   For `a_2 = 1`, the sequence of ones is empty (`1-1=0`).\n    *   For `a_3 = 2`, the sequence of ones is `1` (`2-1=1`).\n    *   For `a_4 = 1`, the sequence of ones is empty (`1-1=0`).\n\n    Inserting these sequences of ones between twos, we get:\n    `[2, (empty), 2, (empty), 2, (1), 2, (empty), 2]`\n    When a sequence is empty, the flanking twos become adjacent. This gives the final continued fraction:\n    ****\n\nThis is the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\nFor completeness, we can calculate the numerator of this continued fraction (which is the Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)) using the continuant polynomial `K(a_1, ..., a_n)`:\n*   `K()` = 1\n*   `K(2)` = 2\n*   `K(2, 2)` = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5\n*   `K(2, 2, 2)` = 2 * 5 + 2 = 12\n*   `K(2, 2, 2, 1)` = 1 * 12 + 5 = 17\n*   `K(2, 2, 2, 1, 2)` = 2 * 17 + 12 = 34 + 12 = 46\n*   `K(2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2)` = 2 * 46 + 17 = 92 + 17 = 109\n\nSo, the Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is 109.\n\n<<<>>>"
