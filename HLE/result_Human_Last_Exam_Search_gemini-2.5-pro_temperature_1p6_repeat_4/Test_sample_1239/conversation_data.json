    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ describes the transformations that map a solution of the equations to another solution. The dimension of this group corresponds to the number of independent parameters that define these continuous transformations. The maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is generated by the following transformations:\n\n*   **Time translation:** The equations are invariant under a shift in time, $t \\to t + \\tau$. This is a one-parameter group, contributing **1** to the dimension.\n*   **Space translations:** The equations are invariant under a spatial shift, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$, where $\\mathbf{a}$ is a constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a three-parameter group, contributing **3** to the dimension.\n*   **Space rotations:** The equations are invariant under a rotation of the spatial coordinates, $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix in the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$. The group $SO(3)$ is three-dimensional, contributing **3** to the dimension.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, with the velocity field transforming as $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$, where $\\mathbf{v}$ is a constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a three-parameter group, contributing **3** to the dimension.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** The equations possess a scaling symmetry. If $(\\mathbf{x}, t, \\mathbf{u}, p)$ is a solution, then so is $(\\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\lambda^2 t, \\lambda^{-1}\\mathbf{u}, \\lambda^{-2} p)$ for any scaling factor $\\lambda > 0$. This is a one-parameter group, contributing **1** to the dimension.\n*   **Pressure shift:** Since only the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$, appears in the equations, they are invariant under a constant shift in pressure, $p \\to p + c$. This one-parameter group contributes **1** to the dimension. While allowing the pressure shift to be a function of time leads to an infinite-dimensional group, for the maximal finite-dimensional algebra, it is taken as a constant shift.\n\nSumming the dimensions from each of these independent symmetry groups gives the total dimension of the Lie group.\n\nTotal dimension = 1 (time translation) + 3 (space translations) + 3 (space rotations) + 3 (Galilean boosts) + 1 (scaling) + 1 (pressure shift) = 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
