    "The symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C1 in Schoenflies notation. This is based on the data provided by Eckard Specht's comprehensive online resource, \"Packomania\".\n\nThe website provides a graphical and data-rich repository of the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle. For the specific case of 1135 circles, the corresponding data page does not explicitly state a symmetry group. According to the website's own legend, if the symmetry group field is left empty, it signifies a C1 symmetry.\n\nC1 symmetry, in Schoenflies notation, represents the lowest order of symmetry where the only symmetry operation is the identity (no rotation or reflection).\n\n<<<C1>>>"
