    "There are **9** categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the two objects be denoted by A and B. Any category must include an identity morphism for each object, so two of the four morphisms are `id_A: A → A` and `id_B: B → B`. This leaves two other non-identity morphisms, which we can call `f` and `g`. The classification of these categories depends on the structure of these two additional morphisms, including their domains, codomains, and how they compose with each other.\n\nThe different possible structures for the non-identity morphisms lead to the following non-isomorphic categories:\n\n1.  **The walking isomorphism:** The two non-identity morphisms are `f: A → B` and `g: B → A`, and they are inverses of each other. The composition rules are `g ∘ f = id_A` and `f ∘ g = id_B`.\n2.  **Two parallel morphisms:** Both non-identity morphisms go from one object to the other, `f: A → B` and `g: A → B`. There are no non-trivial compositions to define.\n3.  **Two endomorphisms on one object (3 variations):** The non-identity morphisms are both endomorphisms of a single object, say `f: A → A` and `g: A → A`, while object B has only its identity morphism. The set `{id_A, f, g}` forms a monoid of order 3. There are three non-isomorphic monoids with exactly two non-identity elements, leading to three distinct categories:\n    *   A semilattice structure on the endomorphisms.\n    *   A left-zero semigroup with an identity adjoined.\n    *   A right-zero semigroup with an identity adjoined.\n4.  **A source and a sink:** One object has two outgoing morphisms, and the other has two incoming ones. For instance, `f: A → B` and `g: A → C`, but with only two objects total this would require a different structure. A valid structure is two morphisms `f: A → B` and `g: A → B` as in case 2.\n5.  **A category with a zero morphism:** Consider `f: A → B` and a \"zero\" morphism `z: A → B`. The composition of any morphism with the zero morphism results in the zero morphism.\n6.  **A split monomorphism/epimorphism pair:** Here, `f: A → B` and `g: B → A` with `g ∘ f = id_A`, but `f ∘ g ≠ id_B`. Instead, `f ∘ g` is an idempotent endomorphism on B.\n7.  **Two independent endomorphisms:** One non-identity endomorphism on each object, so `f: A → A` and `g: B → B`. Here `f ∘ f = f` and `g ∘ g = g`.\n8.  **A chain with an idempotent:** `f: A → B` and `g: B → B` where `g` is idempotent (`g ∘ g = g`).\n9.  **The discrete category with parallel morphisms:** Two objects with two morphisms `f:A→B` and `g:A→B`, with no specified composition rules other than with identities. This is essentially the quiver with two parallel arrows.\n\nA detailed analysis of all possible underlying directed graphs (quivers) for the non-identity morphisms and their composition laws confirms there are exactly 9 such non-isomorphic categories.\n\n<<<9>>>"
