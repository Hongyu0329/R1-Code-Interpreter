    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p).**\n    According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in a given orbit is quantized and is given by the formula L = nħ, where 'n' is the principal quantum number and 'ħ' is the reduced Planck constant. For the first Bohr orbit, n=1, so the angular momentum is L = ħ. The angular momentum is also related to the linear momentum (p) and the radius of the orbit (r) by the equation L = pr.\n\n    Therefore, the linear momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit is p = L/r = ħ/r. The radius of the first Bohr orbit is known as the Bohr radius (a₀), which is approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ meters.\n\n2.  **Calculate the uncertainty in the electron's momentum (Δp).**\n    The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in an object's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to half of the reduced Planck constant. The formula is expressed as:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\n    To find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n    Given that the uncertainty of the electron's position is Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n\n3.  **Find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum (Δp/p).**\n    We can now set up the ratio:\n\n    Ratio = Δp / p = [ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)] / [ħ / a₀]\n\n    By simplifying this expression, the reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out:\n\n    Ratio = a₀ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n    Now, we substitute the known values:\n    *   Bohr radius (a₀) ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n\n    Ratio = (5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\n    Ratio = (5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (20 x 10⁻¹² m)\n    Ratio ≈ 2.646\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
