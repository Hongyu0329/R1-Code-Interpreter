    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is determined by the structure of its Weyl group. Specifically, for a split reductive group over a finite field, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is in a one-to-one correspondence with the number of conjugacy classes of the associated Weyl group.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. This is a fixed integer, independent of the field size $q$. The conjugacy classes of the Weyl groups for exceptional types, including $E_8$, were famously classified by R. W. Carter in 1972.\n\nAccording to this classification, the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly 112 conjugacy classes.\n\n<<<112>>>"
