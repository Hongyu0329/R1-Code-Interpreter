    "A total of 13 finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for all elements *a*, *b*, *c* in *S* (not necessarily distinct), the relation *ab* = *c* does not hold. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (also referred to as locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart. They proved that if a finite group *G* has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3, its order, denoted |*G*|, must be less than or equal to 24.\n\nThe finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3 are:\n*   **C_5 x C_2** (Cyclic group of order 10)\n*   **D_10** (Dihedral group of order 10)\n*   **C_7** (Cyclic group of order 7)\n*   **C_9** (Cyclic group of order 9)\n*   **C_3 x C_3** (Elementary abelian group of order 9)\n*   **C_12** (Cyclic group of order 12)\n*   **D_12** (Dihedral group of order 12)\n*   **A_4** (Alternating group on 4 elements)\n*   **Q_12** (Dicyclic group of order 12)\n*   **D_14** (Dihedral group of order 14)\n*   **Q_16** (Quaternion group of order 16)\n*   **C_2 x A_4**\n*   **SL(2,3)** (Special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field of 3 elements)\n\nThis exhaustive list comes from the complete classification provided in the work of Anabanti and Hart.\n\n<<<13>>>"
