    "The film you are looking for is likely the 2001 independent film \"Nowhere\" directed by Gregg Araki.\n\nIn a pivotal and visually striking scene, the character Dark Smith, portrayed by James Duval, rides a pink bicycle directly into the path of an oncoming car. This act of defiance is a memorable moment in the film, which is known for its surreal and often confrontational imagery.\n\n\"Nowhere\" was produced by a collaboration of production companies, including Desperate Pictures and Union Générale Cinématographique (UGC), and was distributed by Fine Line Features, a former division of New Line Cinema, which was a major independent film studio that later became a unit of Warner Bros. While not a large-budget blockbuster, it is a significant work of 1990s independent cinema and fits the description of a feature film produced by a notable studio within that context.\n\n<<<Nowhere>>>"
