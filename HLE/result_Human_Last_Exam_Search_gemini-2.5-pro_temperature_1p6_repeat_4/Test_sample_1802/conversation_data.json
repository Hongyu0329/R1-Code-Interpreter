    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix is $d^2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the qudit.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators**: A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is described by the following operation on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k P_k \\rho P_k^\\dagger$\n    Here, $\\{P_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which are unitary and form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $\\{p_k\\}$ are probabilities, meaning they are non-negative ($p_k \\ge 0$) and sum to one ($\\sum_k p_k = 1$). The operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} P_k$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank**: Any quantum channel can be viewed as the result of a system interacting with an environment. The complementary channel describes the resulting state of the environment. The rank of the complementary channel is determined by the number of linearly independent Kraus operators of the original channel. Specifically, the rank is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ formed by the Kraus operators, with entries $G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(A_i^\\dagger A_j)$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Gram Matrix**: For the Pauli channel, the entries of the Gram matrix are:\n    $G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_i} P_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} P_j)) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(P_i^\\dagger P_j)$\n\n4.  **Orthogonality of Pauli Operators**: The generalized Pauli operators have the property of being orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product:\n    $\\text{Tr}(P_i^\\dagger P_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$\n    where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta (it is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 otherwise).\n\n5.  **Rank of the Gram Matrix**: Substituting the orthogonality relation into the Gram matrix equation gives:\n    $G_{ij} = d \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\delta_{ij}$\n    This shows that the Gram matrix is a diagonal matrix. The rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. The diagonal entries are $d \\cdot p_i$. As long as $p_i > 0$, these entries are non-zero. Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ in the definition of the Pauli channel.\n\n6.  **Maximizing the Rank**: To find the maximal possible rank, we need to find the maximum number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ that can define a valid Pauli channel. Since there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, there can be up to $d^2$ non-zero probabilities $p_k$. A valid channel can be constructed by choosing all $p_k$ to be non-zero, for instance, by setting $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k=0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$. This specific choice corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel, which maps any quantum state to the maximally mixed state.\n\nSince it is possible to have a Pauli channel with $d^2$ non-zero coefficients, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d**2>>>"
