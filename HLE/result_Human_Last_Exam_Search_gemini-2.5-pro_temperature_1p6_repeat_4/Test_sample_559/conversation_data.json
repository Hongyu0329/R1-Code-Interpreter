    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides trajectories with different long-term behaviors, and these are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n$u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t)-1)$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe find the equilibrium points by setting $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we have $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, or $2d^2 + 2d = 0$. This gives $2d(d+1)=0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. Thus, **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)** are also equilibrium points.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo classify these points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an **unstable node (source)**.\n*   **At (-1, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. With one positive and one negative eigenvalue, (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Identifying the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds associated with the saddle point at (-1, 1). An invariant manifold is a curve or surface that is a union of trajectories. We look for an invariant curve that passes through the saddle point.\n\nLet's test if the parabola $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system. An invariant manifold has the property that if a trajectory starts on it, it stays on it. To verify this, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the system of differential equations.\n\nTaking the derivative of $d = -u^2$ with respect to $t$, we get:\n$d' = -2u \\cdot u'$\n\nSince we know $u' = u^2(u-1) = u^3 - u^2$, we have:\n$d' = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\n$2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3+u^4$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$= (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nSince both expressions for $d'$ are identical, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold.\n\nLet's check if this manifold passes through the saddle point (-1, 1). If $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through (-1, 1). Therefore, this curve is one of the manifolds of the saddle point.\n\nThe tangent to the curve $d = -u^2$ at the saddle point (-1, 1) has a slope in the (d,u) plane given by $\\frac{du}{dd} = \\frac{du}{du} / \\frac{dd}{du} = 1 / (-2u)$. At u=1, this is -1/2. The direction vector is $(1, -1/2)$ or $(-2, 1)$. The unstable eigenvector for the saddle point has the direction $(-2, 1)$, confirming that $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions of differing trajectory behavior. Trajectories on either side of this curve will follow different paths as time progresses.\n\n<<<The separatrix of the system is the curve given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
