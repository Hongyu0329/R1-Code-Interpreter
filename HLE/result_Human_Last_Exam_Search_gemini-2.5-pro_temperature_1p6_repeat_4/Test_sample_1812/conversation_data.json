    "The user has provided a matrix and asked for its determinant. The context provided is \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n\nFirst, I will calculate the determinant of the given matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n`det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n\nSubstituting the values from matrix A:\n`det(A) = 2(2*2 - (-1)*(-1)) - (-1)((-1)*2 - (-1)*(-1)) + (-1)((-1)*(-1) - 2*(-1))`\n`det(A) = 2(4 - 1) - (-1)(-2 - 1) + (-1)(1 + 2)`\n`det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)`\n`det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3`\n`det(A) = 0`\n\nThe determinant is 0.\n\nNow, I will address the context of the \"Markov quiver\". A quiver is a directed graph. Its adjacency matrix, in the context of cluster algebras, is often a skew-symmetric matrix. The provided matrix A is symmetric, not skew-symmetric. However, the term \"adjacency matrix\" can have different meanings in different mathematical fields. For a simple graph (undirected), the adjacency matrix is symmetric.\n\nThe search results indicate that the Markov quiver is related to the Markov Diophantine equation x² + y² + z² = 3xyz. The search also mentions that there are three quivers with properties similar to the Markov quiver, all having 3 nodes.\n\nIt seems the provided matrix A is related to the Laplacian matrix of a complete graph K3, which would be:\n\\[\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis is exactly the matrix given by the user. The determinant of the Laplacian matrix of any undirected graph is always 0. The context about the Markov quiver and the specific value of \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) appears to be extraneous information, as the request is to compute the determinant of a specifically provided matrix.\n\nRegardless of the context of the \"Markov quiver,\" the determinant of the given matrix is a straightforward calculation.\n\nFinal calculation check:\n`2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 - (-2))`\n`2 * 3 - 3 - 3 = 0`\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThe determinant of the matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis computed as follows:\n`det(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))`\n`det(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)`\n`det(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3`\n`det(A) = 0`\n\n<<<0>>>"
