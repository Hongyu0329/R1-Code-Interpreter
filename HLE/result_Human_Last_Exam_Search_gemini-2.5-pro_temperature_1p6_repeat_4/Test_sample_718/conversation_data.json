    "In the context of the representation theory of posets, particularly within the framework of persistence theory and homological algebra, an \"$n$-resolvable\" functor refers to one that admits a projective resolution of length $n$. For a tame functor defined on an upper semilattice, its homological properties are particularly well-behaved.\n\nLet $J$ be an upper semilattice and $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ be a tame functor. The category of such tame functors, denoted $\\text{tame}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, is an abelian category in which every object has a minimal free resolution. This is due to the property that functors indexed by upper semilattices admit discretisations with transfers.\n\nAccording to established results in the homological algebra of tame functors, every such functor $f$ in $\\text{tame}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ admits a resolution of length 1. This means that for any tame functor $f$, there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n\n$0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n\nwhere $P_0$ and $P_1$ are projective functors in the category $\\text{tame}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. Consequently, the projective dimension of any such functor is at most 1.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
