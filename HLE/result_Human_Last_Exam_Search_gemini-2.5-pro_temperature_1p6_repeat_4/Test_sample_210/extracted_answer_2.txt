Between 1803 and 1823, the number of settlers on the Talbot grant grew to just under 20,000 by 1826, although the exact number considered "destitute" is not recorded. By 1821, Colonel Talbot had claimed over 65,000 acres, making his holdings at least 60,000 acres larger than his original 5,000-acre grant.
