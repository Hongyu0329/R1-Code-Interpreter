The approximate number of physical qubit-cycles for a non-Clifford gate on a distance-3 code is around 4,212. For a distance-5 code with a 1% physical error rate, it is not practical to build a universal quantum computer, as this error rate is at or above the fault-tolerance threshold, making the resource cost to achieve a sufficiently low logical error rate prohibitively high.
