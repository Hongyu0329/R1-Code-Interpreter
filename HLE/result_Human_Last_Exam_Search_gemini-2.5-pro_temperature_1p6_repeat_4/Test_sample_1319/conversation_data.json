    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* is Mount Athos. The ancient epic poem references several terrestrial mountains in its narrative of the Trojan War.\n\nBesides the mythical abode of the gods, Mount Olympus (2,918 meters), the *Iliad* makes note of the following peaks:\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located in northeastern Greece, Homer mentions Athos in the *Iliad*. This mountain, which rises to a height of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet), is the most prominent of the historical mountains in the epic, aside from Olympus.\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** The *Iliad* frequently refers to a Mount Ida from which the gods, particularly Zeus, observed the Trojan War. This is the Mount Ida located in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), near the site of Troy, with an elevation of 1,770 meters (5,820 feet). Another Mount Ida exists on Crete and is the island's highest point at 2,456 meters, but the one central to the *Iliad's* narrative is the Anatolian peak.\n\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly, Greece, is mentioned as the source of the wood for Achilles' formidable spear. Its highest point is 1,624 meters.\n\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Saos/Fengari):** In the *Iliad*, the sea god Poseidon is famously depicted watching the conflict from the highest peak of Samothrace. The summit of this island mountain is approximately 1,609 meters (about a mile) high.\n\nComparing their elevations, Mount Athos stands as the tallest of these historical mountains mentioned in the epic poem after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
