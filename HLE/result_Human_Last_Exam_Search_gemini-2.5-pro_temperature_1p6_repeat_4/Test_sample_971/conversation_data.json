In the Act I variation of this performance, she executed a sequence of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\nBased on analysis of the available video footage from this 2008 performance, Natalia Osipova performed **eight** single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in the Act I variation. Following the pirouettes, she concluded the sequence with a series of fouett√© turns.\n\nIt is worth noting that various performances by the same dancer can have slight differences in choreography and execution. There are also recordings of her performing the same role with the Bolshoi Ballet in other years, such as 2011, which may vary. However, in the specific 2008 guest performance video, the count of eight single pirouettes is consistent.\n\n<<<8>>>"
