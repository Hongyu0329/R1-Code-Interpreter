    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, often denoted as G(r,t) and also known as the Van Hove correlation function, describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at a time **t**, given that there was a particle at the origin at t=0. This function is fundamental in describing the microscopic structure and dynamics of a system of particles.\n\nWhen performing inelastic neutron scattering experiments, which are crucial for understanding neutron behavior in nuclear reactors, the measured quantity is directly related to the double Fourier transform of this correlation function. The Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable **r** yields the momentum transfer (or wave vector) **k** (or **q**), and the Fourier transform with respect to the time variable **t** yields the energy transfer ω.\n\nThis resulting function, S(k,ω), is known as the dynamic structure factor. It contains information about the collective motions and inter-particle correlations within the material, which are essential for accurately modeling neutron thermalization and scattering in nuclear systems. The accurate calculation of criticality safety parameters, such as the effective multiplication factor (k<sub>eff</sub>), relies on precise thermal scattering data, which is directly related to the dynamic structure factor. The data is often represented in a related form, S(α,β), in nuclear data libraries used for criticality calculations.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
