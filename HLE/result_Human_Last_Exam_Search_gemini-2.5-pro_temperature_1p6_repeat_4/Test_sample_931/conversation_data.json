    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predators of soft-bodied insects. Multiple sources confirm that their diet includes aphids and mites. In addition to being carnivorous, adults of some species have also been observed feeding on nectar and pollen.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the provided answer choices reveals the following:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Some non-predatory species of adult snakeflies are known to feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While snakeflies do consume pollen, Raphidioptera are not naturally found in the Southern Hemisphere, including New Zealand where the Māhoe tree is native. An attempt was made to introduce an American snakefly species to New Zealand in the early 20th century, but it failed to establish a population. Therefore, there is no record of them feeding on Māhoe pollen.\n*   **C. Fungus:** The diet of adult snakeflies consists of other insects, nectar, and pollen, not fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Snakeflies are not herbivorous and do not eat leaf tissue. Furthermore, like the Māhoe, the Karamū plant is native to New Zealand, where snakeflies are not established.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are known predators of aphids. While the Totara aphid is specific to New Zealand, where snakeflies do not naturally occur, aphids are a major component of their diet.\n\nBased on available feeding records, adult Raphidiopterans consume both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
