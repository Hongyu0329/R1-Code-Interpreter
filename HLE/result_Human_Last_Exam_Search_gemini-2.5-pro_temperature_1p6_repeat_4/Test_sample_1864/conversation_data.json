    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with detection in the AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 channels, you should prepare a minimum of **8 essential controls**. For more complex or sensitive experiments, an additional set of up to 5 highly recommended controls should be included, bringing the total to 13.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n### **Essential Controls (Minimum of 8 Samples)**\n\nThese controls are critical for the proper setup of the flow cytometer, accurate data interpretation, and successful sorting.\n\n1.  **Unstained Cells (1 control):** This sample consists of only your cells without any fluorescent labels. It is crucial for:\n    *   Assessing the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population.\n    *   Setting the initial forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) voltages to visualize your cells.\n\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 controls):** These are required to correct for spectral overlap, which is the spillover of a fluorochrome's emission into a detector intended for another color. For accurate compensation, you need a single-stained control for each fluorochrome in your panel. Each compensation control must include both a positive and a negative population.\n    *   **AF350 control:** Cells or beads stained only with the AF350-conjugated antibody.\n    *   **GFP control:** A sample of cells expressing GFP.\n    *   **PE control:** Cells or beads stained only with the PE-conjugated antibody. This will also account for the streptavidin-PE conjugate if that is what's being used.\n    *   **AF647 control:** Cells or beads stained only with the AF647-conjugated antibody.\n    *   **AF750 control:** Cells or beads stained only with the AF750-conjugated antibody.\n    *   **Note:** Compensation beads are often preferred as they provide a bright, consistent signal.\n\n3.  **Viability Dye Control (1 control):** In sorting experiments, it is essential to exclude dead cells, which can non-specifically bind antibodies and have high autofluorescence. This requires:\n    *   A single-color compensation control for the viability dye (e.g., DAPI, Propidium Iodide, or a fixable viability dye).\n    *   A method to set the gate for dead cells, often using a sample of heat-killed or otherwise compromised cells stained with the viability dye.\n\n4.  **Streptavidin Bead Negative Control (1 control):** This control is necessary to determine the level of non-specific binding from the streptavidin bead complex. This could be:\n    *   Cells incubated with the fluorescently-labeled streptavidin beads but without the biotinylated targeting molecule.\n    *   If using a biotinylated primary antibody, an isotype control is recommended. This would be a non-specific antibody of the same isotype and with the same biotin modification, used at the same concentration as the primary antibody.\n\n---\n\n### **Highly Recommended Controls (Up to 5 Additional Samples)**\n\nFor the most accurate gating and publication-quality data, especially when sorting dim or rare populations, the following controls are strongly advised.\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (up to 5 controls):** FMO controls are samples stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel, except for one. These are invaluable for accurately identifying the boundary between positive and negative populations by revealing the spread of fluorescence from other channels into the one being measured. For a five-color panel, you could prepare up to five FMO controls, one for each channel. FMO controls are particularly important for a sorting experiment to ensure the purity of the sorted populations.\n\n### **Summary of Controls**\n\n| Control Type | Number of Samples | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Essential Controls** | | |\n| Unstained Cells | 1 | To measure autofluorescence and set initial parameters. |\n| Single-Color Compensation | 5 | To correct for spectral overlap between the five channels. |\n| Viability Dye | 1 | To exclude dead cells from the analysis and sort. |\n| Bead Negative Control | 1 | To assess non-specific binding of the streptavidin beads. |\n| **Subtotal (Essential)** | **8** | |\n| **Highly Recommended**| | |\n| FMO Controls | Up to 5 | To accurately set gates for positive populations, especially for dim signals. |\n| **Total (Comprehensive)** | **Up to 13** | |\n\nBy preparing these controls, you will ensure your flow cytometry sorting experiment is accurate, reproducible, and yields high-purity sorted populations.\n\n<<<For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with the specified detection channels, you should prepare a minimum of 8 essential controls. Including highly recommended controls for the most robust results would bring the total to 13 control samples.>>>"
