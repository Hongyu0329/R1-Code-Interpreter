    "The protein that, when broken down or reduced, enhances the ability of macrophages to engulf amyloid is **Glia Maturation Factor-gamma (GMFG)**.\n\nGMFG is a protein involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton of immune cells. Scientific studies have demonstrated that when the levels of GMFG are reduced or \"knocked down\" in macrophages, their capacity to phagocytose, or ingest, amyloid-beta (Aβ) is significantly increased. Conversely, overexpressing GMFG in these cells leads to a reduction in their ability to clear Aβ.\n\nThe mechanism behind this is linked to GMFG's role in controlling cell-surface receptors. The reduction of GMFG leads to an increase in the expression of Scavenger Receptor Class A Type I (SR-AI). This receptor is crucial for binding and taking up amyloid-beta. Therefore, the breakdown of GMFG essentially equips macrophages with more of the necessary machinery to clear amyloid deposits. This finding suggests that GMFG could be a potential therapeutic target for diseases characterized by amyloid accumulation, such as Alzheimer's disease.\n\n<<<Glia Maturation Factor-gamma>>>"
