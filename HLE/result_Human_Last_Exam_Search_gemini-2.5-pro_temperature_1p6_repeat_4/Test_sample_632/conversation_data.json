    "**No Record of Architectural Feature Removal from Piazza della Rotonda in 1950**\n\nExtensive research has found no evidence of a unique architectural feature being removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome in the year 1950, as suggested by the user's query. Historical records and architectural chronicles of the famous square fronting the Pantheon do not mention any such demolition or removal by the city administration during that specific year.\n\nThe most notable architectural alteration to the Pantheon, which is the dominant structure of the piazza, was the removal of two bell towers in 1883. These towers, often pejoratively called the \"ass's ears,\" were added in the 17th century and their demolition was a significant change to the building's silhouette.\n\nInvestigations into architectural modifications in Rome during the mid-20th century, including the post-war and Fascist eras, also did not reveal any specific projects involving the removal of a feature from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. While demolitions and constructions occurred in other parts of Rome during this period, the Piazza della Rotonda appears to have been unaffected in the manner described. For example, the construction of the Via della Conciliazione was completed in 1950, but this was a major project focused on the approach to St. Peter's Basilica, not the Piazza della Rotonda.\n\nA search for a \"Madonnella,\" a shrine to Mary, confirmed its presence in the piazza, but there is no indication it was removed in 1950. The other significant features of the square, the central fountain by Giacomo della Porta and the Egyptian obelisk, were added in 1575 and 1711, respectively, and remain in place today.\n\nBased on available historical and architectural records, the premise that a unique architectural feature was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 is not supported by factual evidence.\n\n<<<Based on the research, there is no evidence that a unique architectural feature was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. A notable architectural change to the Pantheon itself, the removal of its twin bell towers, occurred in 1883.>>>"
