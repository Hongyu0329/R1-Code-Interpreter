    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n### 2. Decomposition of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters with conductors that are the prime power factors of $N$.\nIn this case, a primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\cdot \\chi_9 \\cdot \\chi_7 \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each $\\chi_q$ is a primitive character with conductor $q$.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. Thus, we need:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nThis implies two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_q$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders of the component characters must contain at least one order that is a multiple of 2 and at least one that is a multiple of 3.\n\n### 4. Number of Primitive Characters for Each Conductor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power conductor $q$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=4$:** The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice. The number of such characters is 1.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=9$:** The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. A character is primitive if its order is not 1 or 2. The possible orders for primitive characters are 3 and 6. Both 3 and 6 divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_9$ is $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=7$:** The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6, all of which divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=11$:** The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$. The orders of primitive characters are 2, 5, and 10. The only one that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$ is 1.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=13$:** The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nNow, let's verify the lcm condition.\nLet the orders of the chosen components be $(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$.\n*   The choice for $\\chi_4$ has order $k_4 = 2$. This ensures the lcm is a multiple of 2.\n*   The choices for $\\chi_9$ have orders $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. In either case, the order is a multiple of 3. This ensures the lcm is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders must be a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. As all component orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Therefore, the lcm is exactly 6 for any combination of the selected characters.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
