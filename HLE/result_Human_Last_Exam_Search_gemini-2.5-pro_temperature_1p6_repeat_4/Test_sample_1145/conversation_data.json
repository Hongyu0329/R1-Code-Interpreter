    "The probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a given interval is calculated by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval. For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wave function is given by:\n\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the quantum state n = 2, the wave function is:\n\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, |ψ₂(x)|², is therefore:\n\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a, we must compute the following definite integral:\n\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. Here, θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\n\nP = (2/a) ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/2) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nEvaluating at the limits:\n\nP = (1/a) * [(0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π * 0.505a / a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π * 0.495a / a))]\nP = (1/a) * [0.01a - (a/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π))\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)))\nP = 0.01 - (2sin(0.02π))/(4π)\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)\n\nUsing a calculator (ensuring calculations are in radians), we can find the numerical value:\n\nP ≈ 0.01 - sin(0.0628318) / (6.28318)\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.0628174 / 6.28318\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999737\nP ≈ 0.00000263\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 2.63 x 10⁻⁶. It's important to note that for the n=2 state, the wave function has a node (zero probability) at the exact center of the box (x = 0.5a). The requested interval is very small and centered around this node, which is why the resulting probability is very low but not exactly zero.\n\n<<<2.63e-6>>>"
