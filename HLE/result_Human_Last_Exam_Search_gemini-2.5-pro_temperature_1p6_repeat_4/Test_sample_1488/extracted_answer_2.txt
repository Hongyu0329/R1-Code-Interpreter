Based on the provided XRD data, the material is crystalline, likely with a cubic unit cell structure. To determine the precise chemical phase and lattice constants, further analysis using a crystallographic database is necessary. The most prominent peaks are located at 2-theta angles of approximately 33.02°, 35.96°, 39.18°, 46.56°, and 49.26°.
