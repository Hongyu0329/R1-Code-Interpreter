    "To solve the equation Ⅳ/ⅩⅩⅩ-ⅩⅩⅠⅩ, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numbers.\n\n*   **Ⅳ** is 4.\n*   **ⅩⅩⅩ** is 30.\n*   **ⅩⅩⅠⅩ** is 29.\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n4 / 30 - 29\n\nFollowing the order of operations (division before subtraction):\n\n1.  **Divide 4 by 30:**\n    4 ÷ 30 ≈ 0.1333...\n\n2.  **Subtract 29 from the result:**\n    0.1333... - 29 = -28.8667...\n\nThe precise answer can also be expressed as a fraction:\n\n4/30 - 29 = 2/15 - 435/15 = -433/15\n\nAs a decimal, -433 divided by 15 is approximately -28.8667.\n\n<<<-28.8666666667>>>"
