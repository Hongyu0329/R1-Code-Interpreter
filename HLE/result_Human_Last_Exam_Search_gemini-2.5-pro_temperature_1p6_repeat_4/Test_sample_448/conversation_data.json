    "### Radon Identified as Earth's Rarest Noble Gas in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was unequivocally radon (Rn). Its extreme scarcity is a direct consequence of its radioactive nature, as it possesses no stable isotopes and its longest-lived isotope has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n\nRadon is continually formed through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium within the Earth's crust. However, its rapid decay prevents it from accumulating in any significant quantities in any of the Earth's major reservoirs, including the crust, mantle, atmosphere, or core.\n\nThe abundance of radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be a minuscule 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. This transient existence starkly contrasts with the stable noble gases, which have amassed over geological timescales.\n\nFor perspective, a comparison with xenon (Xe), the rarest stable noble gas, highlights radon's ephemeral nature. The Earth's atmosphere alone, which constitutes a tiny fraction of the planet's total mass, contains vastly more xenon than the total amount of radon present across the entire planet. The mass of xenon in the atmosphere is approximately 2.03 x 10¹² kg, while the total estimated mass of radon in the Earth's crust at any given moment is roughly 1.08 x 10⁴ kg. This makes the atmospheric inventory of xenon about 200 million times greater than the entire planet's inventory of radon.\n\nWhile there is a \"missing xenon problem\" in Earth's atmosphere, suggesting a significant portion may be trapped in the crust and mantle, this would only further increase xenon's total terrestrial abundance, making the gap between it and radon even wider. The concentrations of all other stable noble gases—helium, neon, argon, and krypton—are substantially higher than that of xenon. Therefore, due to its inherent instability and short half-life, radon stands out as the noble gas with the lowest abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
