    "In the problem of spin-orbit coupling for a p-electron, we are interested in the eigenvalues of the total angular momentum operators, $J^2$ and $J_z$. The total angular momentum, **J**, is the sum of the orbital angular momentum, **L**, and the spin angular momentum, **S**.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1. An electron is a spin-1/2 particle, so its spin quantum number is *s* = 1/2.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are determined by the rule of angular momentum addition, which ranges from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\nFor a p-electron:\n*   *j* can take the values |1 - 1/2| and 1 + 1/2.\n*   Thus, the possible values for *j* are 1/2 and 3/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ and $J_z$ operators are given by:\n*   Eigenvalues of $J^2$ = ħ² *j*(*j* + 1)\n*   Eigenvalues of $J_z$ = ħ *m_j*\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and *m_j* can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nWe can now find the common eigenvalues for each possible value of *j*:\n\n### For the state with j = 3/2:\n\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\n    ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n*   The possible values for *m_j* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues for $J_z$ are:\n    **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (3/2)ħ**\n\n### For the state with j = 1/2:\n\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\n    ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n*   The possible values for *m_j* are -1/2 and 1/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues for $J_z$ are:\n    **(-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ**\n\nIn summary, the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron are:\n\n*   For j = 3/2, the $J^2$ eigenvalue is (15/4)ħ², and the $J_z$ eigenvalues are (-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ.\n*   For j = 1/2, the $J^2$ eigenvalue is (3/4)ħ², and the $J_z$ eigenvalues are (-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ.\n\n<<<\nThe common eigenvalues are determined for the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers, j = 3/2 and j = 1/2.\n\nFor **j = 3/2**:\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   The eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **(3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ**.\n\nFor **j = 1/2**:\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   The eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **(1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ**.\n>>>"
