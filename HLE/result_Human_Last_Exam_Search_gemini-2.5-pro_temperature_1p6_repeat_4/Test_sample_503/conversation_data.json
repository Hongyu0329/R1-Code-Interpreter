    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory, between two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps (1-morphisms) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ and two inequalities (2-morphisms): the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. These two inequalities are the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$. This is equivalent to the condition that for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, $L(i) \\le j$ if and only if $i \\le R(j)$.\n\nFor such an adjunction to exist, the map $L$ must be a left adjoint functor and $R$ must be a right adjoint functor in the category of posets.\nA map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). For the posets $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, which are complete lattices, this means preserving the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element. Therefore, an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves the bottom element, i.e., $L(0) = 0$.\n\nDually, a map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). This includes preserving the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element. Therefore, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves the top element, i.e., $R(n) = m$.\n\nIf an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ satisfies $L(0)=0$, it has a unique right adjoint $R$, and this $R$ will satisfy $R(n)=m$. Conversely, if an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ satisfies $R(n)=m$, it has a unique left adjoint $L$, and this $L$ will satisfy $L(0)=0$.\n\nThus, counting the number of internal adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nIn this problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ with $L(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$ of length 23, with values taken from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThe values in the sequence are $0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. We can map this to a \"stars and bars\" problem. Let $y_k = L(k)$ for $k=1, \\dots, 23$. We have the sequence $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$.\nLet's define a new set of variables:\n$x_1 = y_1$\n$x_2 = y_2 - y_1$\n...\n$x_{23} = y_{23} - y_{22}$\n$x_{24} = 37 - y_{23}$\n\nEach $x_i$ must be a non-negative integer. Their sum is:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{24} x_i = y_1 + (y_2 - y_1) + \\dots + (y_{23} - y_{22}) + (37 - y_{23}) = 37$.\nSo, we are looking for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_{24} = 37$.\nUsing the stars and bars formula, the number of solutions is given by:\n$\\binom{S+k-1}{k-1} = \\binom{37+24-1}{24-1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, we could count the number of right adjoints $R: \\to$, which are order-preserving maps satisfying $R(37)=23$. This corresponds to counting non-decreasing sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ where values are from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. This would give $\\binom{23+38-1}{38-1} = \\binom{60}{37}$, which is equal to $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nNow we compute the value:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$\nCalculating this value gives:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = 46,487,339,363,402,400$.\n\n<<<46487339363402400>>>"
