    "After a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, it has several potential fates. The key aspects of the question are \"retention\" (keeping both copies) and \"divergence\" (the two copies becoming different over time). Let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that tends to make sequences between duplicated genes more similar. Therefore, it actively works *against* divergence and promotes homogenization, making this choice incorrect.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene, where one copy accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. This mechanism involves the *loss* of a functional copy, not the retention of two divergent, functional genes.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this process, one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a new, beneficial function. This mechanism explains both retention (the original function is preserved and a new, advantageous one is gained) and divergence (the second copy must change to acquire the new function).\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns (subfunctions). After duplication, degenerative mutations can occur in each copy, such that each gene now only performs a subset of the original functions. Consequently, both genes are required to be retained to perform the complete ancestral function. This explains retention and also leads to divergence as the genes specialize.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This refers to the rapid diversification of a single lineage into many new species. While gene duplication is thought to provide the raw genetic material that can fuel adaptive radiation, it is a large-scale evolutionary pattern, not the specific molecular mechanism responsible for the fate of an individual duplicated gene.\n\n**Comparing Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. The key difference lies in the process. Neofunctionalization requires the evolution of a brand-new, beneficial function, which is considered a relatively rare adaptive event.\n\nSubfunctionalization, under the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, provides a pathway for retention through a neutral process. It relies on the accumulation of more common, slightly deleterious mutations that knock out different subfunctions in each copy. Because both copies are then needed to fulfill the original function, natural selection preserves them both. This provides a compelling explanation for the initial retention of many duplicate genes without requiring a rare beneficial mutation. This initial retention then provides a longer timeframe during which the genes can diverge further, potentially even leading to neofunctionalization later on.\n\nBecause subfunctionalization provides a more common, neutral pathway for the initial and necessary step of retention, allowing for subsequent divergence, it is considered a highly likely and fundamental mechanism for the preservation of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
