    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (let's denote it as L) reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, a substitution reaction occurs, forming the complex `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`.\n\nTo determine the number of isomers formed, we need to consider the stereochemistry of both the reactants and the products.\n\n*   **Reactant:** `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` is an octahedral complex. Because the two chloride ligands are adjacent (cis), the complex lacks a mirror plane and is therefore chiral. This means it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, known as enantiomers. These are designated as Δ (delta) and Λ (lambda).\n\n*   **Ligand:** 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (L) and 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) are both symmetric bidentate ligands.\n\n*   **Product:** The resulting complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`, is a tris(bidentate) octahedral complex. Complexes of this type, `[M(A-A)2(B-B)]`, where A-A and B-B are two different symmetric chelating ligands, are also chiral. They exist as a pair of enantiomers (Δ and Λ).\n\nThe reaction involves the ligand L replacing the two chloride ligands. Typically, this type of substitution reaction on a chiral ruthenium center proceeds with retention of the original configuration. Therefore, starting with a standard racemic mixture of Δ- and Λ-`cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` will produce a racemic mixture of the product:\n*   Δ-`[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` will form Δ-`[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`\n*   Λ-`[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` will form Λ-`[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`\n\nThus, two isomers, which are a pair of enantiomers (the racemic mixture), are formed.\n\n<<<2>>>"
