    "The \"rule activation level,\" also known as the firing strength, in a fuzzy system measures the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of a rule is satisfied. When a rule's antecedent consists of multiple conditions connected by a logical `AND`, their individual degrees of truth are combined using a mathematical operator called a t-norm.\n\nThe problem provides two values, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. While `Phi_k(x')` typically represents the firing strength of an antecedent and `μG_k_j(y_j)` represents a membership in the consequent (the \"THEN\" part), the question asks for the \"rule activation level\" *given both values*. This implies the most probable interpretation is to calculate the combined firing strength of a rule with two antecedent parts whose individual membership degrees are 0.7 and 0.9.\n\nThe presence of \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" indicates the advanced context from which these values originate, designed to handle high levels of uncertainty. However, as the provided inputs are crisp numbers, the problem simplifies to applying a standard fuzzy logic operation.\n\nSince the specific t-norm is not defined, the activation level will differ based on which t-norm is used. The three most common t-norms are the Minimum, Product, and Lukasiewicz t-norms. The calculation for each is as follows:\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm (Gödel t-norm):** This is the most frequently used t-norm. It takes the minimum of the values.\n    *   Calculation: `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Product t-norm:** This t-norm multiplies the values.\n    *   Calculation: `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n*   **Lukasiewicz t-norm:** This t-norm is calculated as `max(0, a + b - 1)`.\n    *   Calculation: `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nEach of these results represents a valid rule activation level depending on the t-norm chosen for the fuzzy system's design.\n\n<<<\nThe rule activation level depends on the specific t-norm operation used. The results for the most common t-norms are:\n*   Using the **Minimum t-norm**: 0.7\n*   Using the **Product t-norm**: 0.63\n*   Using the **Lukasiewicz t-norm**: 0.6\n>>>"
