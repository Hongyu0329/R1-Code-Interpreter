    "I have been unable to identify the specific individual who held the position of judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461.\n\nHistorical records confirm that the city of Bártfa had a judge and a town council during this period. For instance, documents from 1461 mention correspondence addressed to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa\". Archival records from the Bártfa city archives (now in the State Archives in Prešov, Bardejov Branch) for the year 1461 exist, including a document issued by the city of Bártfa on July 13, 1461. However, the available search results do not specify the name of the judge who was in office at that time.\n\nWhile the administrative structure of Bártfa in the 15th century is documented, the name of the judge for the specific year of 1461 is not readily available in the searched online sources. Finding this information would likely require direct consultation of the aforementioned city archives.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 based on the available information.>>>"
