    "## The Dawn of Timekeeping: Americas' Oldest Recorded Date Found in Mexico\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using a native writing system is \"1 Earthquake,\" inscribed on Monument 3 at San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico. This monument, attributed to the Zapotec civilization, is dated to approximately 600-500 BCE. The inscription is considered one of the first instances of writing in Mesoamerica and features a calendrical day-name. The monument depicts a carved figure of a captive, with the glyphs for \"1 Earthquake\" located between his legs.\n\nWhile the Zapotec inscription at San José Mogote holds the title for the earliest specific date, other discoveries mark significant milestones in the development of writing and timekeeping in the ancient Americas.\n\nThe Olmec civilization is credited with what is potentially the oldest writing system in the Western Hemisphere, found on the Cascajal Block, dating to around 900 BCE. However, the inscriptions on this artifact do not contain a discernible calendrical date. Later Olmec artifacts, such as a ceramic cylinder seal from around 650 BCE, show symbols that may be related to the 260-day calendar, with one glyph interpreted as \"3 Ajaw,\" a day name.\n\nIn the Maya world, the earliest known calendrical notation is the date \"7 Deer,\" found on mural fragments at San Bartolo, Guatemala, dated between 300 and 200 BCE. These murals, discovered within the Las Pinturas pyramid complex, indicate a well-established artistic and scribal tradition by the third century BCE.\n\nA more complex and precise system of dating, the Long Count calendar, appears later. The earliest known inscription using the Long Count is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico. This monument, associated with the Epi-Olmec culture, bears the date of December 36 BCE. Another very early Long Count date, 32 BCE, was discovered on Stela C from Tres Zapotes, an Olmec site.\n\nTherefore, while the Olmecs were pioneers in developing writing systems, and the Maya developed a sophisticated calendrical and writing tradition, the earliest currently known recorded date belongs to the Zapotecs of San José Mogote.\n\n<<<\"1 Earthquake\" on San José Mogote Monument 3 (c. 600-500 BCE)>>>"
