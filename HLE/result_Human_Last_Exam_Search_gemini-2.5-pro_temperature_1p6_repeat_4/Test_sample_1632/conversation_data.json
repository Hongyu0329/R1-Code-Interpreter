    "A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice is another term for the square lattice, which resembles a grid of city streets. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), is a sequence that has been calculated for various values of n.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, the value of a(10) is 44,100. A list of these values for different step lengths has been compiled through computational methods.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
