In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) in the frequency-momentum domain is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. The specific functional form is G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη), where iη is an infinitesimal term that ensures causality.
