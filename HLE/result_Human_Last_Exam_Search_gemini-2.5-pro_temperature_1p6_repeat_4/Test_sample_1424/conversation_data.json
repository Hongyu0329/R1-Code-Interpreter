    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀, also known as the non-interacting Green's function, describes the propagation of a single particle without the influence of interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ, is most transparently expressed in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\nThe path integral formulation provides a method for calculating quantum-mechanical propagators by summing over all possible paths. For a non-interacting system, the action in the path integral is quadratic in the fields, allowing for exact calculation. When Fourier transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain, the bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) for a particle with momentum **k** and frequency ω reveals its direct dependence on the energy eigenvalues ϵₖ.\n\nThe functional dependence is given by:\n***\n<font size=\"4\"> G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη) </font>\n***\n\nHere:\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum representation.\n*   **ω** represents the frequency.\n*   **ϵₖ** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum **k**.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimally small imaginary number. This term is crucial for ensuring causality; it dictates how the poles of the Green's function are treated in contour integrals. The sign of `iη` can vary depending on the specific type of Green's function (retarded, advanced, or time-ordered). For instance, the retarded Green's function has `+iη`, while the advanced has `-iη`.\n\nEssentially, the bare Green's function is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency `ω` and the single-particle energy `ϵₖ`. A key consequence of this relationship is that the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This feature makes the Green's function a powerful tool for identifying the energy spectrum of a system. The general form `(ω - H₀(k))⁻¹`, where H₀ is the non-interacting Hamiltonian matrix, simplifies to the expression above when the Hamiltonian is diagonal with eigenvalues ϵₖ.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) in the frequency-momentum domain is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. The specific functional form is G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη), where iη is an infinitesimal term that ensures causality.>>>"
