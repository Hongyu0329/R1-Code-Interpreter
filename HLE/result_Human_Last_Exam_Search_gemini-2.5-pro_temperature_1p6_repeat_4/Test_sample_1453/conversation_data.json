    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern and the residues at the core positions.\n\n### Understanding Coiled-Coil Structure\n\nCoiled-coil structures are formed by two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their stability and oligomeric state (i.e., the number of helices in the bundle) are largely determined by the packing of amino acid side chains at their interface. This packing follows a principle known as \"knobs-into-holes\".\n\nCoiled coils feature a repeating seven-amino-acid sequence called a heptad repeat, with positions labeled `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The residues at positions **`a`** and **`d`** are typically hydrophobic and form the buried core of the structure, providing the main driving force for oligomerization. The identity of the amino acids at these core positions is a key determinant of the number of helices that will assemble.\n\n### Determining Oligomerization State from Sequence\n\nA seminal study by Harbury et al., and subsequent research, established predictive rules based on the residues found at the `a` and `d` positions, particularly for the hydrophobic amino acids Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L):\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored when Isoleucine is at the `a` position and Leucine is at the `d` position.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored when Isoleucine is present at both the `a` and `d` positions.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored when Leucine is at the `a` position and Isoleucine is at the `d` position.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Sequence\n\nThe provided sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nTo apply the rules, we must first determine the correct \"phase\" or register of the heptad repeat. We need to identify which amino acids occupy the `a` and `d` positions. We can do this by looking for a repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues are consistently found at positions `i` and `i+3`.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that Leucine (L) is at the `a` positions and Isoleucine (I) is at the `d` positions:\n1.  The first Leucine (L) is at position 7. If this is an `a` position, the corresponding `d` position should be at `7 + 3 = 10`.\n2.  Position 10 in the sequence is an Isoleucine (I). This fits the proposed `a=L, d=I` pattern.\n3.  Let's see if this pattern continues. The next `a` position should be seven residues after the first, at `7 + 7 = 14`. Position 14 is indeed a Leucine (L).\n4.  The corresponding `d` position should be at `14 + 3 = 17`. Position 17 is an Isoleucine (I). The pattern holds.\n5.  Continuing this analysis:\n    *   The next `a` position is at `14 + 7 = 21`, which is a Leucine (L).\n    *   The next `d` position is at `21 + 3 = 24`, which is an Isoleucine (I).\n    *   The final `a` position is at `21 + 7 = 28`, which is a Leucine (L).\n\nThis phasing is consistent throughout the entire length of the coiled-coil domain. Therefore, we can confidently assign:\n*   **`a` positions:** Occupied exclusively by Leucine (L).\n*   **`d` positions:** Occupied exclusively by Isoleucine (I).\n\nBased on the established rules of knobs-into-holes packing, a coiled-coil with Leucine at the `a` positions and Isoleucine at the `d` positions is known to preferentially form a **tetramer**. This is due to the specific geometric requirements of packing the larger Leucine and the Î²-branched Isoleucine side chains, which is most efficient in a four-helix bundle.\n\nThus, the predicted oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
