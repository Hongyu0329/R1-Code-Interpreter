    "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the value of `S` from `S = SNYWR`. A search for the ticker \"SNYWR\" does not yield a direct result. However, \"SNY\" is the ticker symbol for Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company. It is highly probable that `S` is the stock price of SNY. The search results show recent prices for Sanofi (SNY) ranging from $48.43 to $49.34. Let's take the most recent closing price found, $48.83. Thus, we set `S = 48.83`.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of integer values of the side `AC` in a triangle `ABC` for which there are two possible values for the side `AB`. We are given `BC = S = 48.83` and `m∠B = 30°`.\n\nThis is the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines (SSA). For a given angle `B` and sides `b = AC` and `a = BC`, two distinct triangles can be formed if and only if the following condition is met:\n\n`a * sin(B) < b < a`\n\nLet's substitute the given values into this inequality:\n*   `a = BC = S = 48.83`\n*   `b = AC`\n*   `∠B = 30°`, so `sin(B) = sin(30°) = 0.5`\n\nThe condition becomes:\n`48.83 * 0.5 < AC < 48.83`\n`24.415 < AC < 48.83`\n\nWe need to find the number of integers that `AC` can take within this interval. The integers must be greater than 24.415 and less than 48.83.\nThe smallest integer value for `AC` is 25.\nThe largest integer value for `AC` is 48.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this range, we calculate:\n`Number of integers = Last Integer - First Integer + 1`\n`Number of integers = 48 - 25 + 1 = 24`\n\nTherefore, there are 24 possible integer values for the side length `AC`.\n\n<<<24>>>"
