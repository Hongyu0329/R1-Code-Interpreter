The total displacement field through the transistor, representing the combined influence of both gates, is given by the expression $D = C_{tg}V_{tg} + C_{bg}V_{bg}$. This value corresponds to the total surface charge density induced in the grounded channel due to the applied gate voltages. It is the sum of the displacement field in the top dielectric, $D_{tg} = C_{tg}V_{tg}$, and the displacement field in the bottom dielectric, $D_{bg} = C_{bg}V_{bg}$.
