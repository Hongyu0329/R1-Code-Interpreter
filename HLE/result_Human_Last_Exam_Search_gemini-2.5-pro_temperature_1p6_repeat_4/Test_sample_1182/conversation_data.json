    "The stable reduction of an algebraic curve is a simplified version of the curve that preserves its essential arithmetic information. The singularities in this reduced form are restricted to be ordinary double points, also known as nodes. To determine the number of these nodes for the given curve, one must analyze the 2-adic properties of the branch points of the curve.\n\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. The process to find the number of double points involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the branch points:** The branch points of the curve are the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side, including the point at infinity. The polynomial can be factored as $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x + 8)$. One root is clearly $x=0$. Let the other four roots, which are the roots of $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$, be denoted by $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$. The set of six branch points is $B = \\{0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots:** By analyzing the Newton polygon of the polynomial $g(x)$ for the prime $p=2$, we can determine the 2-adic valuations of its roots. The analysis shows that one root, say $\\alpha_1$, has a 2-adic valuation of $v_2(\\alpha_1) = 3$. The other three roots, $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, each have a 2-adic valuation of $v_2(\\alpha_j) = -1$.\n\n3.  **Group branch points into clusters:** The structure of the stable reduction is determined by how the branch points cluster together. Two branch points, `a` and `b`, belong to the same cluster if their 2-adic \"distance\" is positive. For finite points, this distance is $v_2(a-b)$. The point at infinity requires special handling. The analysis leads to the formation of two clusters:\n    *   **Cluster 1 ($C_1$):** This cluster contains $\\{0, \\alpha_1\\}$, as $v_2(\\alpha_1 - 0) = 3 > 0$.\n    *   **Cluster 2 ($C_2$):** This cluster contains $\\{\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$. The points $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ are clustered with infinity because $v_2(\\alpha_j) = -1 < 0$ for each, which makes them \"close\" to infinity in a p-adic sense.\n\n4.  **Determine the components of the stable reduction:** Each cluster of branch points corresponds to an irreducible component in the special fiber of the stable reduction. Since there are two clusters, the stable reduction consists of two components, let's call them $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n\n5.  **Count the nodes:** The total number of double points is the sum of the nodes internal to each component and the nodes formed by the intersections of different components.\n    *   **Intersection nodes:** Since the dual graph of a stable reduction is a tree, the two components $V_1$ and $V_2$ must intersect at one point, creating one node.\n    *   **Internal nodes of $V_1$:** This component is associated with the 2 branch points in $C_1$. A curve defined by 2 branch points is rational (genus 0) and its reduction is a smooth projective line, which has no nodes.\n    *   **Internal nodes of $V_2$:** This component is associated with the 4 branch points in $C_2$. A curve with 4 branch points is an elliptic curve (genus 1). A detailed analysis of its j-invariant reveals that its 2-adic valuation is greater than 0. This implies that the reduction of this elliptic curve is singular, specifically a nodal cubic curve. A nodal cubic has one double point.\n\nSumming these up, the stable reduction has one node from the intersection of its two components and one internal node from one of the components. Therefore, the total number of double points is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
