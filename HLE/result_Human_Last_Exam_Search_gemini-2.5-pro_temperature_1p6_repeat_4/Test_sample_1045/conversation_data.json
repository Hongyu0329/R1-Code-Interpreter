    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation, the number of contracted Gaussian functions is determined for each atom and then summed up for the entire molecule.\n\n*   **Toluene (C₇H₈):** The molecule consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **6-31G Basis Set for Carbon:** Carbon is a second-row \"heavy\" atom. The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set.\n    *   **Core orbital (1s):** This is described by a single contracted Gaussian function.\n    *   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** These are \"split\" into two parts.\n        *   An inner part, which consists of one s-function and three p-functions (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂). This accounts for 4 contracted functions.\n        *   An outer part, which also consists of one s-function and three p-functions. This adds another 4 contracted functions.\n    *   Total for one carbon atom: 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for inner 2s and 2p) + 4 (for outer 2s and 2p) = 9 contracted functions.\n\n*   **6-31G Basis Set for Hydrogen:** Hydrogen only has a valence 1s orbital.\n    *   **Valence orbital (1s):** This is split into two parts.\n        *   An inner part, represented by one contracted s-function.\n        *   An outer part, also represented by one contracted s-function.\n    *   Total for one hydrogen atom: 1 (inner 1s) + 1 (outer 1s) = 2 contracted functions.\n\n**Calculation for Toluene (C₇H₈):**\n\n*   **From the 7 carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 contracted functions.\n*   **From the 8 hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 contracted functions.\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
