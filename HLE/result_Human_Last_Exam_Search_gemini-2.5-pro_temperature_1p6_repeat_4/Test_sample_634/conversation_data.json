    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, a systematic method involving elementary row operations can be employed. This method is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm used for finding the greatest common divisor of two polynomials.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe form a composite matrix M by stacking P1 and P2:\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nThe goal is to reduce this matrix to a simpler form using elementary row operations, where the multipliers can be polynomials. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form the GCRD.\n\n1.  Use the fourth row (R4) to eliminate the second column entries in the other rows.\n    *   Add s times R4 to R1: R1' = R1 + s*R4 = [s^2 + s + s(-s-1), -s + s] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, 0] =.\n    *   Subtract s^2 times R4 from R2: R2' = R2 - s^2*R4 = [-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s-1), s^2 - s^2] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0] = [s^3 - 1, 0].\n    *   R3 already has a zero in the second column.\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M' = [,\n          [s^3 - 1, 0],\n          [s, 0],\n          [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n2.  Now, focus on the rows with only a non-zero first column: [s^3 - 1, 0] and [s, 0]. We can apply the Euclidean algorithm to the polynomials s^3 - 1 and s.\n    *   gcd(s^3 - 1, s) can be found by dividing s^3 - 1 by s. The remainder is -1. Since the remainder is a non-zero constant, the polynomials are coprime, and their gcd is 1.\n    *   This implies we can create a row through row operations. For instance, (s^2)*R3 - R2' = [s^2(s) - (s^3 - 1), 0] = [s^3 - s^3 + 1, 0] =. Let's call this new row R_new.\n\n3.  With the row R_new =, we can eliminate the first column entry in the last row.\n    *   Add (s+1) times R_new to R4: R4' = R4 + (s+1)*R_new = [-s - 1 + (s+1)(1), 1 + (s+1)(0)] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1] =.\n\nAfter these operations, the set of non-zero rows that form a basis for the row space of the original matrix M is {,}.\n\nThese rows form the greatest common right divisor matrix. The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant). In this case, the resulting GCRD is the identity matrix.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is:\n[,\n]\n\nThis means that the matrices P1 and P2 are right-coprime.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
