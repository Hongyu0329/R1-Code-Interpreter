    "The sequence provided does not follow a discernible mathematical pattern. Analysis of the differences between the numbers, their prime factors, and their repetitions does not yield a consistent rule.\n\nThe numbers in the sequence bear a strong resemblance to the numbered pieces used in 3D sculpture puzzles, such as the Hasbro King Tut puzzle mentioned in search results. These puzzles require stacking the pieces in a specific, non-mathematical order to create a sculpture. The provided sequence is very likely the stacking order for one such puzzle. Without the official solution guide for that specific puzzle, it is impossible to determine the next number with accuracy.\n\n<<<124>>>"
