    "I am unable to determine the exact number of pas de Balanchine Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo scene of the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nMy research confirmed that Svetlana Gileva did perform this role with the Semperoper Ballett during that period. However, all efforts to locate a video of this specific performance have been unsuccessful. The official YouTube links to the \"Jete Woman solo\" from the 2015 production are no longer active, and extensive searches on other video platforms and with various search terms did not yield a viewable copy of the performance.\n\nA \"pas de Balanchine\" is a specific ballet step involving a leap from one leg to the other, creating a diamond shape in the air, often accompanied by a specific arm movement. Without a visual record of the choreography as performed by Ms. Gileva, a precise count of this step is impossible. While reviews and articles confirm her performance, they do not provide the granular detail required to answer your question.\n\nTherefore, due to the unavailability of the necessary video evidence, I cannot provide a definitive number.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question because the video of the performance is not available.>>>"
