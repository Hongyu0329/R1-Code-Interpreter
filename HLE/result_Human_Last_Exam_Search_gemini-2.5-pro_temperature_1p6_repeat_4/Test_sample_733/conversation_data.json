    "A definitive classification by mathematicians Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart reveals that there are exactly **eight** finite groups which contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. A subset *S* of a group *G* is defined as product-free if the product of any two elements in *S* (including an element with itself) is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in that group.\n\nThe eight finite groups that satisfy this condition are:\n\n*   **C₂ × C₂**: The Klein four-group.\n*   **C₄**: The cyclic group of order 4.\n*   **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n*   **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n*   **C₇**: The cyclic group of order 7.\n*   **C₈**: The cyclic group of order 8.\n*   **D₆**: The dihedral group of order 6, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃.\n*   **Q₁₂**: The dicyclic group of order 12.\n\nThe classification is detailed in the paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\" published in the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics. The paper systematically identifies the groups based on the properties of the size 2 product-free set, such as whether it contains elements of order 2 (involutions) and whether the set generates the entire group. For instance, in some cyclic groups, sets of the form `{a, a⁻¹}` are maximal product-free sets of size 2. The analysis in the paper also covers cases where the product-free set does not generate the group, leading to the inclusion of all eight specified groups.\n\n<<<8>>>"
