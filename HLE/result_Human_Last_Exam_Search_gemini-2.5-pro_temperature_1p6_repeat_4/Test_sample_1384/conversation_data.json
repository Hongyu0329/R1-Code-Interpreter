    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we can follow these steps:\n\nFirst, let the number be $x = e^{-7^{13}}$. To find the first digits of this very small number, it is useful to work with logarithms to the base 10. The logarithm of x to base 10 is:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can be written as:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nThe next step is to calculate the values of $7^{13}$ and $\\log_{10}(e)$.\n$7^{13} = 96,889,010,407$\nThe value of $\\log_{10}(e)$ is approximately 0.4342944819.\n\nNow, we multiply these two numbers:\n$96,889,010,407 \\cdot 0.4342944819 \\approx 42,078,028,733.9918$\n\nSo, we have:\n$\\log_{10}(x) \\approx -42,078,028,733.9918$\n\nAny number can be expressed in scientific notation as $N \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le N < 10$ and $k$ is an integer. In our case, $x = 10^{\\log_{10}(x)}$. We can rewrite the exponent as the sum of its integer and fractional parts.\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -42,078,028,734 + 0.0082$\n\nThus, $x = 10^{-42,078,028,734 + 0.0082} = 10^{0.0082} \\times 10^{-42,078,028,734}$.\n\nThe leading non-zero digits of $x$ are determined by the value of $10^{0.0082}$. Using a calculator, we find:\n$10^{0.0082} \\approx 1.01905$\n\nTherefore, the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$ begins with a large number of zeros, followed by the digits of 1.01905...\n$x \\approx 0.00...00101905...$\n\nThe first non-zero digit is 1.\nThe second digit is 0.\nThe third digit is 1, which is the second non-zero digit.\n\nThus, the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are 1 and 1.\n\n<<<11>>>"
