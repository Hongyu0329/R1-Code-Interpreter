    "**Analysis of the Question:**\n\nThe user is asking for the key technical difference between a cambré derrière (a backward bend) as performed in the Vaganova (Russian) ballet method and the Balanchine (American) ballet method.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define Cambré Derrière:** A cambré is a bend of the body from the waist. \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\" So, a cambré derrière is a backbend. This is a fundamental movement taught in all major ballet methods.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Core Principle:** The Vaganova method emphasizes core strength, stability, and control.\n    *   **Execution:** The bend originates from the upper back, lifting up and out of the waist before arching backward.\n    *   **Key Point:** The hips must remain square and stable, directly over the supporting legs/feet. They do not push forward. The movement is controlled from the back muscles, and the alignment of the lower body is strictly maintained to ensure stability and prevent injury. The line created is a clean, controlled arch of the upper spine.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Core Principle:** The Balanchine style emphasizes speed, musicality, and extended, often off-balance, lines.\n    *   **Execution:** The movement is often larger, faster, and more dynamic.\n    *   **Key Point:** To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine method allows and often encourages the hips to press forward as the upper body bends back. This creates a counterbalance, allowing for a greater range of motion and a more extreme visual line. This technique is sometimes referred to as creating an \"arabesque penché in reverse.\" The line is intentionally \"broken\" at the hip to create a dynamic shape.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there may be stylistic nuances in how the arms (port de bras) are presented in each method, this is not the fundamental, defining difference in the technique of the backbend itself.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and widely recognized difference. Vaganova keeps the hips stable and aligned over the feet. Balanchine pushes the hips forward. This single change fundamentally alters the mechanics, alignment, and aesthetic of the movement.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is known for its speed, the tempo of a cambré can vary in either style depending on the exercise or musical phrasing. Speed is a quality of the performance, not the core technical difference in *how* the step is formed.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used. The Balanchine method's forward hip placement often *allows* for a deeper backbend, but the cause of this difference is the hip placement itself. Therefore, hip placement is the more fundamental point of distinction.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the line of the spine. While the Balanchine version might be more dramatic, the head placement is secondary to the action of the torso and hips.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most critical technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the stabilization versus the dynamic use of the hips. Vaganova stabilizes the hips, while Balanchine pushes them forward.\n\n<<<B>>>"
