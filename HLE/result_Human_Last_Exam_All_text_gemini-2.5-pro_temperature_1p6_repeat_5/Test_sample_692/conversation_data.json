    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  **An early date:** The record must represent a point in time.\n2.  **Recorded:** The date must be physically written or inscribed, not just inferred from archaeological context.\n3.  **Pre-Columbian civilization:** The creators must be a native civilization of the Americas before 1492.\n4.  **Aboriginal writing system:** The script used must be indigenous to the Americas.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Candidate Civilizations and Systems\nThe most developed writing and calendrical systems in the pre-Columbian Americas were located in Mesoamerica. Key civilizations to consider are:\n*   **Maya:** Famous for their complex hieroglyphic script and the Long Count calendar.\n*   **Olmec/Epi-Olmec:** Precursors to the Maya who developed early forms of writing and calendar systems.\n*   **Zapotec:** A civilization in the Oaxaca Valley known for very early hieroglyphic writing.\n\nTwo main types of dates were recorded:\n*   **Cyclical Dates:** These are dates from the 260-day sacred calendar (known as the *tzolk'in* to the Maya). A date like \"7 Deer\" is a specific day in this 260-day cycle, but the cycle repeats continuously. It is analogous to saying \"Tuesday\" without specifying the week, month, or year.\n*   **Linear Dates (Long Count):** This system records the number of days elapsed since a mythical starting point (August 11, 3114 BCE in the most common correlation). This allows for the recording of specific, unique historical dates.\n\n### Step 3: Examining the Evidence Chronologically\n\n1.  **Oldest, but Cyclical (and debated):** The earliest potential calendrical inscription is on **Monumento 3 at San José Mogote**, an early Zapotec center in Oaxaca. It features a glyph interpreted as **\"1 Earthquake\"**, a day name from the 260-day calendar. The monument's archaeological context is dated to approximately **600 BCE**. While very old, the interpretation as a date is not universally accepted, and it is a cyclical date.\n\n2.  **Oldest Long Count Date:** For a long time, the earliest *securely identified and specific historical date* was found on **Stela C from Tres Zapotes**, an Epi-Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico. The monument is inscribed with a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**. Using the standard GMT correlation, this translates to **September 3, 32 BCE**. This is a linear date that fixes a unique day in history.\n\n3.  **Current Earliest Secure Date (Cyclical):** In 2022, a major discovery was announced from the site of **San Bartolo, Guatemala**. Archaeologists found painted plaster fragments from the Las Pinturas pyramid. One fragment clearly depicts the Maya glyph for the date **\"7 Deer\"**, a day in the 260-day sacred calendar. The charcoal found in the same layer as the fragment was securely radiocarbon-dated to between **300 and 200 BCE**.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Candidates and Drawing a Conclusion\n*   The \"7 Deer\" fragment from San Bartolo (~250 BCE) is now the earliest *securely confirmed* and *unambiguous* example of a written date in the Americas.\n*   It is older than the Tres Zapotes Long Count date (32 BCE).\n*   Although the San José Mogote glyph (\"1 Earthquake\") is potentially older (~600 BCE), its interpretation is less certain than the San Bartolo finding.\n*   Therefore, the scientific consensus points to the San Bartolo \"7 Deer\" fragment as the definitive earliest known recorded date.\n\nThe date that was physically written down is \"7 Deer.\" The record itself was created between 300 and 200 BCE, making it the earliest known instance of such a record.\n\n<<<The earliest known date recorded is the glyph for \"7 Deer\" (a day in the 260-day ritual calendar), found on a painted fragment at the Maya site of San Bartolo, Guatemala. The creation of this record has been radiocarbon-dated to between 300 and 200 BCE.>>>"
