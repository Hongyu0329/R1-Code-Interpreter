    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\" using \"computed tomography\" principles.\n\n*   **Spectral Volume:** This is a 3D dataset, often called a hyperspectral data cube. It has two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). For every pixel (x, y) in a scene, it contains the full spectrum of light intensity.\n*   **Single Image:** The entire dataset must be captured in a single snapshot on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor). This means it's a \"snapshot\" hyperspectral imaging technique, without scanning in space or wavelength.\n*   **Computed Tomography (CT):** This is a mathematical technique for reconstructing a multi-dimensional object from its projections. For example, a 3D object can be reconstructed from a series of 2D X-ray projections taken at different angles. The key principle is that you need projections from multiple angles to solve the reconstruction problem.\n\n### Step 2: How Diffraction Gratings and CT are Combined (CTIS)\nThe technique described is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n1.  **Light Path:** Light from a scene passes through an imaging lens system. A special disperser (the diffraction grating/s) is placed in the optical path before the light hits the 2D detector.\n2.  **Dispersion:** A diffraction grating disperses light. A single point of light, which would normally be focused to a single point on the detector, is spread out into a line or pattern of its constituent colors (its spectrum).\n3.  **Projection:** Each dispersed pattern on the detector is a \"projection\" of the 3D (x, y, λ) data cube onto the 2D detector plane. The entire 2D image captured by the sensor is a complex, overlapping superposition of these projections from every point in the scene.\n4.  **Reconstruction:** A computed tomography algorithm takes this single complex 2D image and uses knowledge of the grating's properties to mathematically \"unscramble\" or \"invert\" the projections, reconstructing the original 3D spectral volume.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Case of a Single 1D Grating\nLet's consider using only one standard (1D) diffraction grating.\n\n*   A 1D grating disperses light along a single axis. For instance, if the grating lines are vertical, the light will be spread out horizontally.\n*   Consider two points in the scene that lie on the same horizontal line, say (x₁, y₀) and (x₂, y₀).\n*   The spectrum of the point at (x₁, y₀) will be spread horizontally on the detector.\n*   The spectrum of the point at (x₂, y₀) will also be spread horizontally on the detector, at the same vertical position.\n*   These two spectral patterns will overlap on the detector. It becomes mathematically impossible to uniquely determine which spectral component came from which original point.\n*   **Analogy to CT:** This situation is analogous to trying to reconstruct a 2D object from a single 1D projection. If you only view an object from one side, you can't know its internal structure. This is a fundamentally ill-posed problem often referred to as the \"missing cone\" problem in Fourier space.\n*   **Conclusion:** One 1D diffraction grating is insufficient.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Case of Two Gratings\nTo solve the ambiguity problem, we need projections from a different \"angle.\"\n\n*   This can be achieved by adding a second 1D grating, oriented at an angle to the first one (typically perpendicularly).\n*   The first grating disperses light horizontally (providing a projection along the x-λ plane).\n*   The second grating disperses light vertically (providing a projection along the y-λ plane).\n*   In practice, these two gratings are usually combined into a single optical element called a **2D crossed-grating**. This single component produces a grid of dispersed images on the detector corresponding to different diffraction orders (e.g., horizontal, vertical, and diagonal dispersions).\n*   Having these multiple projections along different axes provides enough information for the computed tomography algorithm to solve the system of equations and reconstruct the 3D data cube.\n*   **Analogy to CT:** This is like having projections from two different angles (e.g., 0 degrees and 90 degrees), which is the minimum required to begin resolving a 2D structure.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion on the Minimum Number\n*   A single 1D grating is insufficient due to fundamental information loss (ambiguity).\n*   The minimum requirement to make the problem solvable is to have dispersion along at least two different (non-parallel) axes.\n*   This requires the functionality of two 1D diffraction gratings.\n*   Whether these are implemented as two separate physical components or as a single combined 2D grating, the minimum number of fundamental grating structures necessary for the principle to work is two.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
