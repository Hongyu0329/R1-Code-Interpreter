    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System and Goal:**\n    The question asks for the scaling exponent α for the specific heat ($C \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$) in a system with spatial dimension $d=3$. The method to be used is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, which is a core technique in the renormalization group (RG) theory of critical phenomena.\n\n2.  **Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):**\n    The $\\epsilon$ expansion is a perturbative method performed around the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. This is the dimension above which the critical exponents take their simpler, classical mean-field theory values. For a very broad class of models with a continuous symmetry, including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (collectively known as O(n) vector models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n\n3.  **Define and Calculate the Expansion Parameter, $\\epsilon$:**\n    The expansion is carried out in powers of the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n    *   Upper critical dimension: $d_c = 4$\n    *   Spatial dimension of interest: $d = 3$\n    *   Therefore, the expansion parameter is: $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n4.  **Recall the Epsilon Expansion Formula for α:**\n    Within the RG framework for the O(n) vector model (where 'n' is the number of components of the order parameter), the specific heat exponent α can be expressed as a power series in $\\epsilon$. The result to the first order in $\\epsilon$ is:\n    $α = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Universality Class (Value of n):**\n    The question does not specify the model (e.g., Ising, XY). The value of the exponent α depends on 'n'. In the absence of specific information, the standard and most common case to consider is the Ising universality class, which describes systems with a one-component order parameter (e.g., liquid-gas transition, uniaxial magnets).\n    *   For the Ising model: $n=1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Exponent α:**\n    Substitute the values of $n$ and $\\epsilon$ into the first-order formula:\n    *   $n = 1$ (Ising model)\n    *   $\\epsilon = 1$\n    *   $α = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n    Thus, the first-order $\\epsilon$ expansion predicts that the specific heat exponent for a 3D Ising-like system is $1/6$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Universality Class:** The result is specific to the universality class. If the system was an XY model ($n=2$) or a Heisenberg model ($n=3$), the value would be different. For $n=2$, $\\alpha = \\frac{2}{20}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{10}\\epsilon$. For $n=3$, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{22}\\epsilon$. Since the problem is posed generally, the Ising model ($n=1$) is the most standard assumption.\n\n2.  **Nature of the Epsilon Expansion:** The $\\epsilon$ expansion is formally valid only for infinitesimally small $\\epsilon$. Applying it to a real physical dimension like $d=3$ requires setting $\\epsilon=1$, which is an extrapolation far from the perturbative limit ($\\epsilon \\to 0$). While this procedure is standard, its numerical accuracy is not guaranteed. For instance, more precise methods give $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$ for the 3D Ising model, which is close to but not identical to $1/6 \\approx 0.167$. However, the question specifically asks for the result *from the epsilon expansion*.\n\n3.  **Order of the Expansion:** The calculation was performed to the *first order* in $\\epsilon$. Higher-order terms ($O(\\epsilon^2)$, etc.) exist and would provide a more refined (and more complex) estimate. Unless specified otherwise, \"the epsilon expansion result\" typically refers to the leading-order term.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe goal is to find the scaling exponent α for the specific heat at $d=3$ using the $\\epsilon$ expansion.\n\n*   **Framework:** O(n) vector model with $d_c=4$.\n*   **Expansion Parameter:** $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n*   **Formula:** The first-order result for α is $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$.\n*   **Assumption:** We assume the Ising universality class, so $n=1$.\n*   **Calculation:** Substituting $n=1$ and $\\epsilon=1$ gives:\n    $α = \\frac{4 - 1}{2(1 + 8)} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThe final answer, as derived from the standard first-order epsilon expansion, is $1/6$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
