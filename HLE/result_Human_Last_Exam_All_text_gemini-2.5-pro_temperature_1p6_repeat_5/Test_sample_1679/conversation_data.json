    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject: The Luxor Obelisks**\n    *   The first crucial point is to understand what a \"Luxor Obelisk\" is and where the existing ones are located.\n    *   There are two obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n        *   One remains standing at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n        *   The second obelisk was given to France by Egypt in the 19th century and now stands at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n    *   Therefore, a film depicting a Luxor Obelisk must feature scenes set in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n2.  **Create a Chronological List of Best Picture Winners**\n    *   The next step is to examine the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture, starting from the very first award (for 1927/1928), and check their settings.\n\n3.  **Analyze Early Winners for Potential Depictions**\n    *   **_Wings_** (1927/1928): Set during World War I. It has scenes in Paris, but they focus on military action, celebrations at the Folies Berg√®re, and cafes. It does not contain a clear, identifiable shot of the Place de la Concorde obelisk.\n    *   **_The Broadway Melody_** (1928/1929): Set in New York City.\n    *   **_All Quiet on the Western Front_** (1929/1930): Set on the German front lines during WWI.\n    *   **_Cimarron_** (1930/1931): Set in Oklahoma.\n    *   **_Grand Hotel_** (1931/1932): Set in Berlin.\n    *   **_Cavalcade_** (1932/1933): Set in London.\n    *   **_It Happened One Night_** (1934): Set in the United States.\n    *   **_Mutiny on the Bounty_** (1935): Set in England and the South Pacific.\n    *   **_The Great Ziegfeld_** (1936): Set primarily in New York City.\n\n4.  **Identify the First Strong Candidate**\n    *   **_The Life of Emile Zola_** (1937): This film is a biographical account of the famous French writer Emile Zola. Its setting is almost entirely in Paris. As a major studio production from that era, it uses numerous establishing shots to create a sense of place. The film depicts major events in French history, such as the Dreyfus Affair, which involved significant public and political gatherings in Paris. The Place de la Concorde is a central and iconic location in Paris, and it is shown in the film as part of the montage shots establishing the Parisian setting. This makes it the first Best Picture winner to depict the Parisian Luxor Obelisk.\n\n5.  **Review Subsequent Winners to Confirm the \"First\" Status**\n    *   It is important to confirm that no earlier winner qualifies and to acknowledge later winners that also fit the description.\n    *   Films that won between *Zola* and the next clear candidate, such as *Gone with the Wind* (1939) and *Rebecca* (1940), are set in the American South and England, respectively, so they do not feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n    *   *Casablanca* (1943) has a famous flashback sequence set in Paris, but the iconic shots feature the Arc de Triomphe and the Seine riverbanks, not the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   Later films like **_An American in Paris_** (1951) and **_Around the World in 80 Days_** (1956) both prominently feature the Paris obelisk, but they won much later than *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy chronologically analyzing the settings of all Best Picture winners, we can confidently identify *The Life of Emile Zola* as the first winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen, specifically the one located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
