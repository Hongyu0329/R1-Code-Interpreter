    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Properties of the Space X\n\n*   **Object Definition:** $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means $X$ is the zero set of a smooth homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in four variables.\n*   **Dimensions:** $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex manifold of dimension 3 (real dimension 6). As a hypersurface, $X$ is a complex submanifold of complex dimension $3-1=2$. This means $X$ is a complex surface, or equivalently, a real manifold of dimension 4.\n*   **Topological Properties:** As a closed subset of the compact space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, $X$ is a compact manifold. As a complex manifold, it has a natural orientation. Thus, $X$ is a compact, oriented, smooth 4-manifold.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Rank of a Homotopy Group to the Rank of a Homology Group\n\nThe rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the rank of its free part. We want to find $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X))$.\n\n*   **Hurewicz Theorem:** For a path-connected space $Y$, the Hurewicz map $h_n: \\pi_n(Y) \\to H_n(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ relates homotopy and homology groups.\n*   **Simple Connectivity:** First, we need to determine the first homotopy group $\\pi_1(X)$.\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem:** For a smooth complex hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for all $k < n-1$.\n*   **Application to X:** In our case, $n=3$. The theorem implies that $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2$. For $k=1$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n*   **Homotopy of Projective Space:** Complex projective spaces are simply connected, so $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\n*   **Conclusion on $\\pi_1(X)$:** It follows that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. So, $X$ is simply connected.\n\nNow we can relate $\\pi_3(X)$ to $H_3(X)$.\n*   **Rational Hurewicz Theorem:** For any simply connected topological space $Y$, the Hurewicz map induces an isomorphism between the rationalized homotopy and homology groups: $\\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Q})$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n*   The rank of an abelian group $G$ is the dimension of the vector space $G \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, for our simply connected space $X$, we have:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim(\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = \\dim(H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})) = \\text{rank}(H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n*   The rank of the homology group $H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k(X)$. So we need to compute $b_3(X)$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Betti Number $b_3(X)$\n\nWe can compute $b_3(X)$ by relating it to other, more accessible Betti numbers.\n\n*   **Poincaré Duality:** For any compact, oriented $m$-manifold $M$, there is an isomorphism between homology and cohomology groups $H_k(M) \\cong H^{m-k}(M)$. This implies that the Betti numbers satisfy the relation $b_k(M) = b_{m-k}(M)$.\n*   **Application to X:** Since $X$ is a compact, oriented 4-manifold (i.e., $m=4$), we have $b_3(X) = b_{4-3}(X) = b_1(X)$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the first Betti number, $b_1(X)$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Betti Number $b_1(X)$\n\n*   **Hurewicz Theorem (again):** For any path-connected space $Y$, the first homology group $H_1(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(Y)$.\n    $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X)_{ab}$.\n*   **Calculation:** As established in Step 2, $\\pi_1(X)=0$. The abelianization of the trivial group is the trivial group. So, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   **Conclusion on $b_1(X)$:** The rank of the trivial group is 0, so $b_1(X) = 0$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the results from the previous steps, we can find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n1.  $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$ (from Rational Hurewicz theorem as $X$ is simply connected).\n2.  $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$ (from Poincaré Duality on the 4-manifold $X$).\n3.  $b_1(X) = 0$ (from Hurewicz theorem and the fact that $\\pi_1(X)=0$).\n\nTherefore, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 0$.\n\n**Careful points and summary of the logic:**\n*   The argument relies on several powerful theorems in algebraic topology: Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, Hurewicz Theorem, and Poincaré Duality.\n*   The validity of applying each theorem was checked: $X$ is a smooth hypersurface for Lefschetz, simply connected for Rational Hurewicz, and a compact oriented manifold for Poincaré Duality.\n*   The fact that $X$ is a *quintic* (degree 5) hypersurface is not used in the main line of reasoning. The result holds for any smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The degree would be necessary to compute other invariants like the Euler characteristic or the second Betti number, but not for the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nThe final answer is that the rank of the third homotopy group of $X$ is 0. This means that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a torsion group.\n\n<<<0>>>"
