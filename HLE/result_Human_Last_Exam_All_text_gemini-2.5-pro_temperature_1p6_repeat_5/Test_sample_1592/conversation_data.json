    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place refers to the Cree community of Waskaganish, located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. Geographically, it sits on the southeast shore of James Bay at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nWe need to look at the map of Canada to see which provinces or territories are near Waskaganish, keeping in mind the exclusion of Quebec.\n*   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario forms the western and southern coastline of James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, such as the large Akimiski Island.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** The border with Labrador is located far to the east of Waskaganish.\n*   **Manitoba:** The border with Manitoba is to the west of Ontario and does not directly border James Bay.\n\nBased on this, the two closest candidates are Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity to Ontario**\nWaskaganish is on the eastern shore of James Bay. The Ontario border runs down the approximate center of James Bay, with the entire western landmass of the bay belonging to Ontario. The shortest distance from Waskaganish to a non-Quebec landmass would be a relatively straight line across the open water of the bay to the west. This line would land on the coast of Ontario.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Proximity to Nunavut**\nThe territory of Nunavut consists of the islands within James Bay. The most significant and nearest island to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island. This island is located to the northwest of Waskaganish, out in the bay.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances**\nBy visually inspecting a map, we can compare the distances:\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The shortest path from Waskaganish is directly west across the water to the Ontario mainland. The distance is approximately 130-150 kilometers.\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The path to the nearest part of Nunavut (the southeastern tip of Akimiski Island) is to the northwest. This path is longer than the direct east-to-west path across the bay to the Ontario coast.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe mainland coast of Ontario is geographically closer to Waskaganish than any of the islands belonging to Nunavut. Therefore, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Precisely locating Waskaganish on the southeast shore of James Bay is critical.\n*   Understanding that the islands in James Bay are part of Nunavut, while the western shore is part of Ontario, is the key geographical distinction.\n*   Comparing the shortest possible distance, which is a straight line, reveals that the path to the Ontario mainland is shorter than the path to any of the islands of Nunavut.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
