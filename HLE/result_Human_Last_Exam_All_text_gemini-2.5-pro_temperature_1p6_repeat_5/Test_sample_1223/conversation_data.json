    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x$ is a point in $X$.\n\nLet's break down the key terms:\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable.\n*   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** The space $X$ with a single point removed. This is a locally compact, non-compact, sigma-compact metric space.\n*   **Stone-Cech compactification of $Y$ ($\\beta Y$):** The \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space that contains a Tychonoff space $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The set of points added to complete the space, i.e., $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. Let's call this remainder $R$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of $p$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $K$ that contain $p$.\n*   **Maximum possible number:** This phrasing suggests that the number of composants might vary depending on the choice of the continuum $X$ or the point $x$.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the possible types of hereditary indecomposable metric continua\nA crucial point is that the definition of a continuum does not require the space to have more than one point. We must consider two cases:\n1.  **Degenerate case:** The continuum $X$ is a single point.\n2.  **Non-degenerate case:** The continuum $X$ contains more than one point.\n\nThis distinction is key to understanding why the question asks for the \"maximum possible\" number.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the degenerate case\nLet $X = \\{p\\}$ be a single-point space.\n*   **Is it a metric continuum?** Yes, it is compact, connected, and metrizable.\n*   **Is it hereditary indecomposable?** A space is indecomposable if it's not the union of two of its proper subcontinua. The only subcontinuum of $\\{p\\}$ is $\\{p\\}$ itself. There are no proper subcontinua. Thus, the condition for indecomposability holds vacuously. It is therefore hereditary indecomposable.\n*   In this case, we must choose $x=p$. The space we need to consider is $X \\setminus \\{x\\} = \\{p\\} \\setminus \\{p\\} = \\emptyset$ (the empty set).\n*   The Stone-Cech compactification of the empty set is the empty set itself: $\\beta\\emptyset = \\emptyset$.\n*   The Stone-Cech remainder is $\\beta\\emptyset \\setminus \\emptyset = \\emptyset$.\n*   The empty set has no subsets, so it has 0 components and therefore 0 composants.\n*   So, in the degenerate case, the number of composants is **0**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the non-degenerate case\nLet $X$ be a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable metric continuum (e.g., the pseudo-arc). Let $x$ be any point in $X$. Let $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ be the remainder.\n\n1.  **The remainder $R$ is a continuum.** It is a standard result in continuum theory that for any metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the remainder $R$ is a continuum (a compact, connected, Hausdorff space). It is non-trivial because $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not pseudocompact.\n\n2.  **The remainder $R$ is indecomposable.** A key theorem states that the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum if and only if the original space $X$ is not locally connected at the point $x$.\n    We must check if a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum can be locally connected at any point. Assume $X$ is locally connected at some point $x_0$. Then, there exists a connected open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that $U \\neq X$. The closure, $\\bar{U}$, is a subcontinuum of $X$. Since $X$ is hereditary indecomposable, $\\bar{U}$ must be an indecomposable continuum. However, a non-trivial indecomposable continuum cannot contain any proper non-empty connected open subsets. $U$ is a proper non-empty connected open subset of $\\bar{U}$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $X$ is nowhere locally connected.\n    Since $X$ is not locally connected at any of its points, including our chosen point $x$, the remainder $R$ must be an indecomposable continuum.\n\n3.  **The number of composants of $R$.** A fundamental theorem of continuum theory states that any non-trivial indecomposable continuum has exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, also denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$) composants.\n    Since $R$ is a non-trivial indecomposable continuum, it has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize the results and find the maximum\nFrom our analysis, we have found two possible values for the number of composants of the remainder:\n*   **0**, if $X$ is a degenerate continuum (a single point).\n*   **$2^{\\aleph_0}$**, if $X$ is a non-degenerate continuum.\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum possible** number of composants. Comparing the two possible outcomes, the maximum is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe number of a composants of the Stone-Cech remainder can be 0 (in the degenerate case of a single-point continuum) or $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (in the non-degenerate case). The maximum of these two values is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<2^{\\aleph_0}>>>"
