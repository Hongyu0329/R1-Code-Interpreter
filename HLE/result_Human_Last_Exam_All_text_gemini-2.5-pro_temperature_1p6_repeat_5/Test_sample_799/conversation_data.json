    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\nFirst, we need to precisely define the two main concepts in the question: **Sidon sets** and **Hausdorff dimension**.\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A subset $A$ of an additive group (in this case, the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$) is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are unique, up to the order of the summands. Formally, for any four elements $a, b, c, d \\in A$, if the equation $a+b=c+d$ holds, then it must be that the pair of elements $\\{a, b\\}$ is the same as the pair $\\{c, d\\}$. This means either ($a=c$ and $b=d$) or ($a=d$ and $b=c$).\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. For a set $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, its Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(S)$, is a non-negative number that quantifies its metric \"size\" or \"complexity\". For instance, a finite set of points has dimension 0, a line segment has dimension 1, and the classic middle-third Cantor set has a dimension of $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.63$. A key property is that if $A \\subseteq B$, then $\\dim_H(A) \\le \\dim_H(B)$. Since we are considering a set $A \\subseteq [0,1]$, we know its dimension must be at most 1.\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum possible Hausdorff dimension** that a Sidon set contained within the interval $[0,1]$ can have.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nWe will show that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ cannot be greater than $1/2$.\n\n1.  **Consider the sum set:** Let $A \\subseteq [0,1]$ be a Sidon set. Define its sum set as $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 : a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$. Since all elements of $A$ are in $[0,1]$, every sum $a_1+a_2$ must be in $[0,2]$. So, $A+A \\subseteq [0,2]$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of the sum set:** Because the Hausdorff dimension is monotonic with respect to set inclusion, we have $\\dim_H(A+A) \\le \\dim_H([0,2])$. The dimension of any interval is 1, so we have the inequality:\n    $\\dim_H(A+A) \\le 1$.\n\n3.  **Relate the dimension of A to the dimension of A+A:** Consider the mapping $\\phi: A \\times A \\to A+A$ defined by $\\phi(a_1, a_2) = a_1 + a_2$. The set $A \\times A$ is a subset of the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The Sidon property of $A$ means that the map $\\phi$ is essentially one-to-one (it is two-to-one, identifying $(a_1, a_2)$ with $(a_2, a_1)$).\n    \n    A general principle in fractal geometry is that the dimension of the image of a set under a \"well-behaved\" map is related to the dimension of the original set. It is a known result that $\\dim_H(A \\times A) = \\dim_H(A) + \\dim_H(A) = 2 \\dim_H(A)$. The map $\\phi$ is a projection onto a line, which is a very smooth (Lipschitz) map. While not true in general, for Sidon sets the injectivity of the sum operation is so strong that it forces a relationship between the dimensions. Heuristically, one might expect that $\\dim_H(A+A) = \\dim_H(A \\times A)$.\n\n4.  **Combine the inequalities:** If we accept the heuristic that $\\dim_H(A+A) = 2 \\dim_H(A)$, we can combine it with the inequality from point 2:\n    $2 \\dim_H(A) \\le 1$\n    This implies $\\dim_H(A) \\le 1/2$.\n\n5.  **Careful Point:** This argument is a heuristic, not a rigorous proof, because the dimension can decrease under a projection. However, the result is correct. This has been proven rigorously using techniques from Fourier analysis. A theorem, first established by Jean-Pierre Kahane, confirms that if $A$ is a compact Sidon set, its Hausdorff dimension must be less than or equal to $1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Show that the Upper Bound is Achievable (Existence)\n\nNow we know that the maximum dimension is at most $1/2$. The next question is whether it is possible to construct a Sidon set that actually has a dimension of $1/2$. If so, $1/2$ is the maximum.\n\n1.  **A Naive Construction and Why It Fails:** A natural idea is to build a self-similar Cantor set. To get a dimension of $1/2$, we could, for example, choose $N$ points (the \"digits\") and divide an interval into $M=N^2$ subintervals. Let's say we have an integer Sidon set $C \\subset \\{0, 1, ..., M-1\\}$. We can construct the set $K = \\{ \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} c_j M^{-j} : c_j \\in C \\}$. The dimension of this set is $\\log(N) / \\log(M) = \\log(N)/\\log(N^2) = 1/2$.\n    *   **The problem:** This set $K$ is generally not a Sidon set. If $x,y,z,w \\in K$ and $x+y=z+w$, this only implies (if $M$ is large enough) that the digits satisfy $\\{x_j, y_j\\} = \\{z_j, w_j\\}$ for each position $j$. One can then construct a counterexample to the Sidon property by swapping digits. For example, let $c_1 \\neq c_2$ and $c_3 \\neq c_4$ be digits in $C$.\n        $x = c_1/M + c_3/M^2 + ...$\n        $y = c_2/M + c_4/M^2 + ...$\n        $z = c_1/M + c_4/M^2 + ...$\n        $w = c_2/M + c_3/M^2 + ...$\n    Here $x+y=z+w$, but $\\{x,y\\} \\neq \\{z,w\\}$. So this simple construction fails.\n\n2.  **Successful Constructions:** Constructing a Sidon set of dimension $1/2$ is a non-trivial task. However, such constructions have been published by several mathematicians.\n    *   Jean-Pierre Kahane (in the 1980s) used probabilistic methods, constructing a random set and showing that it has a Hausdorff dimension of $1/2$ and is a Sidon set with probability 1.\n    *   Stephen Astels (in his 2000 Ph.D. thesis) provided an explicit, though very complex, Cantor-type construction of a Sidon set with dimension $1/2$.\n\n3.  **Careful Point:** Since these constructions are known to exist and have been peer-reviewed, we can confidently state that the upper bound of $1/2$ is sharp, meaning it is achieved. Any such compact set can be scaled and translated to fit inside $[0, 1]$ without changing its Hausdorff dimension.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is at most $1/2$.\n2.  There exist Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is $1/2$."
