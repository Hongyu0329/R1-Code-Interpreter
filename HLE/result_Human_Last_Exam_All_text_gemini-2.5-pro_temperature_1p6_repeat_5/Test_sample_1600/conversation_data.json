    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(3).\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n\n*   **`a(n)`**: This is a function that gives the number of certain types of Feynman diagrams.\n*   **Feynman diagrams in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: These are graphical representations of interactions between electrons (solid lines) and photons (wavy lines). The fundamental interaction is a vertex where two electron lines meet one photon line.\n*   **Electron or photon propagators**: We are interested in diagrams that represent corrections to the propagation of a single electron or a single photon. These diagrams are called \"self-energy\" diagrams (for electrons) or \"vacuum polarization\" diagrams (for photons). They characteristically have two external lines of the same particle type (two external electron lines or two external photon lines).\n*   **Order `2n`**: In perturbation theory, \"order\" refers to the power of the coupling constant. In QED, the coupling constant is the elementary charge `e`. Each vertex in a diagram contributes one factor of `e`. So, a diagram with `V` vertices is of order `e^V`. However, calculations are typically organized in powers of the fine-structure constant `α ~ e^2`. Therefore, a diagram with `V` vertices is of order `α^(V/2)`. The question's \"order 2n\" corresponds to diagrams with `V = 2n` vertices.\n*   **Relationship between vertices and loops**: For self-energy diagrams in QED (with 2 external lines), the number of loops `L` is related to the number of vertices `V` by the formula `L = V/2`. So, a diagram of order `2n` (i.e., `V=2n` vertices) has `n` loops.\n*   **\"non-vanishing Feynman diagrams\"**: This refers to topologically distinct, connected diagrams that give a non-zero contribution to the physical quantity. In the context of propagator corrections, this is generally understood to mean \"one-particle irreducible\" (1PI) diagrams, which are diagrams that cannot be cut into two separate pieces by severing a single internal line.\n*   **The goal**: We need to find `a(3)`. Based on the above analysis, this means we need to find the number of 3-loop (since n=3) connected, 1PI Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon self-energy. These diagrams will have `V = 2*3 = 6` vertices.\n\n**Step 2: List the number of diagrams for the first few orders**\n\nThe number of such diagrams is a well-known result in quantum field theory literature. Let's list the values of `a(n)` for `n=1, 2, 3`.\n\n*   **For n=1 (`a(1)`):**\n    *   This corresponds to **1-loop** diagrams (`V = 2*1 = 2` vertices).\n    *   For the electron self-energy, there is only one diagram: an electron emits and reabsorbs a photon.\n    *   For the photon self-energy, there is also only one diagram: a photon creates an electron-positron pair which then annihilates back into a photon (a simple fermion loop).\n    *   Therefore, **a(1) = 1**.\n\n*   **For n=2 (`a(2)`):**\n    *   This corresponds to **2-loop** diagrams (`V = 2*2 = 4` vertices).\n    *   By drawing all topologically distinct possibilities for inserting another pair of vertices into the 1-loop diagram, it has been established that there are exactly two such diagrams.\n    *   This holds for both the electron and photon self-energy.\n    *   Therefore, **a(2) = 2**.\n\n*   **For n=3 (`a(3)`):**\n    *   We need the number of **3-loop** diagrams (`V = 2*3 = 6` vertices).\n    *   This is a more complex combinatorial problem. The enumeration has been performed by physicists working on high-order QED corrections. The result is a standard, cited number in the field.\n    *   The systematic construction of these diagrams reveals that there are exactly seven distinct 1PI topologies for the 3-loop self-energy in QED.\n    *   Therefore, **a(3) = 7**.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe function `a(n)` describes the number of `n`-loop 1PI self-energy diagrams in QED. Following the known sequence from QED calculations:\n*   `a(1) = 1`\n*   `a(2) = 2`\n*   `a(3) = 7`\n\nThe question asks for `a(3)`.\n\nThe final answer is **7**.\n\n<<<7>>>"
