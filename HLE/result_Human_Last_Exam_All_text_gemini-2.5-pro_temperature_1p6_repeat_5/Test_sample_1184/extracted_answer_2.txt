**1. Hotspots for Interaction with the alpha-1 subunit (AID-Binding Pocket):**
These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and are essential for the physical binding of the alpha-1 subunit. All positions refer to the human beta-1b isoform sequence (UniProt P54289-1).
*   **Y370 (Tyrosine at position 370):** Forms a critical hydrogen bond with the AID.
*   **W391 (Tryptophan at position 391):** Forms a major part of the hydrophobic binding pocket.
*   **I425 (Isoleucine at position 425):** Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket for AID docking.
*   **Y427 (Tyrosine at position 427):** Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket.
*   **M474 (Methionine at position 474):** Forms the floor of the binding pocket.

**2. Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**
These residues are critical for altering the channel's functional behavior, such as activation and inactivation kinetics, without necessarily being the primary points of binding affinity.
*   **Residues in the N-Terminus (for inactivation modulation):**
    *   **K32 (Lysine at position 32)**
    *   **K33 (Lysine at position 33)**
    *   This pair of positively charged residues in the N-terminus of the Î²1b isoform is a key determinant for its ability to induce strong voltage-dependent inactivation.
*   **Residues in the GK "Hook" Region (for allosteric modulation):**
    *   **D451 (Aspartic Acid at position 451)**
    *   **R453 (Arginine at position 453)**
    *   These residues are located in a loop adjacent to the AID-binding pocket and are crucial for transducing the binding event into a change in the channel's gating properties (both activation and inactivation).
