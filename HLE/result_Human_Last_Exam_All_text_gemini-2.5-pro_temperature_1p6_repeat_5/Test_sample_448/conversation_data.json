    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases and the Scope of the Question**\n\nFirst, we must list the naturally occurring noble gases, which are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n*(Note: Oganesson is also in Group 18, but it is a synthetic element that was first created in 2006 and does not exist naturally on Earth. Therefore, it is not a candidate for the year 2002.)*\n\nThe question asks for the rarest gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This is a crucial point. We must consider the total amount of each gas in the entire Earth (atmosphere, crust, mantle, oceans), not just its concentration in the atmosphere. The specified year, 2002, does not meaningfully change the outcome, as the abundances of these gases are governed by very long-term geological and nuclear processes.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate the More Abundant Noble Gases**\n\nWe can quickly eliminate the most common noble gases by comparing their abundances.\n*   **Argon (Ar)** is by far the most abundant noble gas, comprising nearly 1% of Earth's atmosphere. It is also constantly produced in the crust from the radioactive decay of potassium-40.\n*   **Neon (Ne)** is the second most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere.\n*   **Helium (He)** is the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere. While it is light and escapes to space, it is continuously generated in large amounts within the Earth's crust by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium.\n*   **Krypton (Kr)** is significantly more abundant than Xenon in the atmosphere (about 1.1 parts per million for Krypton vs. 0.09 parts per million for Xenon).\n\nThis process of elimination leaves two candidates for the rarest noble gas: **Xenon** and **Radon**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare Xenon and Radon**\n\nTo determine which is rarer, we must compare their total mass on Earth.\n\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Xenon is a stable element. The vast majority of it that exists on Earth today is primordial, meaning it was trapped during the planet's formation. Its total mass is dominated by the amount present in the atmosphere, which is calculated to be approximately 2 x 10¹³ kg (20 trillion kilograms). While this makes it extremely rare relative to the Earth's total mass, it is a stable and fixed quantity.\n\n*   **Radon (Rn):** Radon is fundamentally different because it is radioactive and all its isotopes have very short half-lives. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This means that any primordial Radon would have decayed away billions of years ago. The only reason Radon exists on Earth at all is that it is constantly being produced as an intermediate step in the radioactive decay chains of uranium and thorium, which are found in rocks and soil. However, because Radon itself decays so quickly, it never accumulates. It exists in a very low-level steady state, where its rate of production is balanced by its rate of decay. The total amount of Radon present across the entire planet (in the soil, groundwater, and atmosphere) at any single moment is estimated to be extremely small, on the order of just hundreds of thousands of kilograms.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWhen we compare the total terrestrial mass of the two rarest candidates:\n*   Total mass of Xenon: ~20,000,000,000,000 kg\n*   Total mass of Radon: ~500,000 kg\n\nRadon is millions of times less abundant by mass than Xenon. Therefore, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
