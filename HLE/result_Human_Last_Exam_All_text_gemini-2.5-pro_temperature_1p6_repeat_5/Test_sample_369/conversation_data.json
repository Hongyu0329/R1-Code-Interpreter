    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**The Line:**\nverum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\n\n**Careful Points & Rules of Scansion:**\n1.  **Feet:** A hexameter line has six feet. Feet 1-4 can be a dactyl (long-short-short, — U U) or a spondee (long-long, — —). Foot 5 is almost always a dactyl. Foot 6 is a spondee (or a trochee, but always scanned as a spondee).\n2.  **Syllable Length:**\n    *   **Long by nature:** Contains a long vowel (e.g., ā, ē) or a diphthong (e.g., ae, au).\n    *   **Long by position:** A short vowel is followed by two or more consonants (e.g., x, z, or a consonant at the end of a word plus another at the start of the next word).\n    *   **Short:** A short vowel not made long by position.\n3.  **Elision:** A syllable ending in a vowel, a vowel + m, or a diphthong is usually dropped (elided) before a word starting with a vowel or 'h'.\n4.  **Ictus:** In poetry, the metrical stress (ictus) can sometimes lengthen a naturally short syllable, particularly at the beginning of a foot.\n5.  **Caesura:** A pause or break within a foot, usually near the middle of the line.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Scansion:**\n\nWe will scan the line from both ends, as the beginning and end of a hexameter line often have more predictable patterns.\n\n**Feet 5 and 6 (The End of the Line):**\n*   \"... convenit imago.\"\n*   Foot 6 must be a spondee (— —). The last two syllables are `-ma-go`. The `ā` in `imāgō` is long by nature. The final `-o` is anceps (can be long or short) and is treated as long at the end of a hexameter line. So, `māgō` is `— —`. This is our **Spondee (S)** for Foot 6.\n*   Foot 5 is nearly always a dactyl (— U U). Let's look at the syllables preceding `-māgō`: `...convenit i-`. The verb is `convenit`. The context (\"an image *has come together*\") implies the perfect tense, which is `cōnvēnit` (with a long `ē`). The syllables are `cōn-vē-nĭt`.\n*   Let's form the dactyl: `vē` is long by nature (—). The `ĭ` in `nĭt` is short, and since it precedes the vowel `i-` of `imāgō`, the syllable `nit` remains short (U). The `ĭ` of `ĭmāgō` is short (U).\n*   Thus, Foot 5 is `vēnit i-`, which scans as **— U U**. This is a **Dactyl (D)**. The foot break (caesura) occurs within the word `imago`.\n\nSo far, we have: **... | ... | ... | ... | D | S**\n\n**Foot 1 (The Beginning of the Line):**\n*   \"verum ubi ...\"\n*   The word `verum` comes from `vērus`, so the `ē` is long. The final `-um` is elided before the `u-` of `ubi`.\n*   The line is scanned as `vēr(um) ubi`. The syllables are `vē-`, `u-`, `bi`.\n*   `vē-` is long by nature (—). The vowels in `ŭbĭ` are both short by nature, so `u-` is short (U) and `bi-` is short (U).\n*   Thus, Foot 1 is `vē-ru(m) u-bi`, which scans as **— U U**. This is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\nSo far: **D | ... | ... | ... | D | S**\n\n**Feet 2, 3, and 4 (The Middle of the Line):**\nThis is the most complex part of the line.\n*   The remaining phrase is `equi atque hominis casu cōn-` (the `cōn-` is left over from `cōnvēnit`).\n*   **Foot 2:** The foot starts with `equi`. The `e` in `ĕqui` is naturally short. A foot cannot begin with a short syllable. This requires an exception: **ictus**. The metrical stress lengthens the `e`, making it `ē-` (—). The next word `atque` begins with a long `ā`. The short `-i` of `equi` is elided.\n*   So, Foot 2 is scanned as `ēqu(i) āt-`, which is **— —**. This is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\nSo far: **D | S | ... | ... | D | S**\n\n*   **Feet 3 and 4:** We have `-que hominis casu cōn-` left to scan. The `-e` of `-que` elides before `hominis`. The phrase is effectively `qu'hominis cāsū cōn-`.\n    *   The syllables of `hominis` are all short (`hŏ-mĭ-nĭs`). The word `casu` (ablative) is two long syllables (`cā-sū`).\n    *   This section presents a well-known difficulty. A simple reading of `qu'ho-mi-nis` gives three short syllables, which cannot start a foot. A common solution for this difficult line involves reading `hominis` with **syncope** (omission of a vowel), as `hōmnis`. The `ō` is then lengthened by ictus, and the syllable becomes long by position before `-mn-`.\n    *   **Foot 3:** With syncope, `qu(e) hōmnis` can be scanned as two syllables. `-que ho-` is elided and the first part of the foot (`hōm-`) becomes long (—). The second part (`-nis`) is made long by position before the `c` of `casu`. So Foot 3 is `hōm-nis`, which scans as **— —**. This is a **Spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 4:** What remains is `casu` and the syllable `cōn-`. The word `cāsū` is composed of two long syllables (`cā-` and `sū-`). This forms a complete foot. So Foot 4 is `cāsū`, which scans as **— —**. This is a **Spondee (S)**. The remaining `cōn-` syllable correctly begins the next foot (`cōn-vēnit...`).\n\n**Final Scansion:**\n*   Foot 1: `ver(um) ubi` -> Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 2: `equ(i) atque` -> Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 3: `hominis` -> Spondee (S) (scanned with syncope as `hōmnis`)\n*   Foot 4: `casu` -> Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 5: `convenit i-` -> Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 6: `-mago` -> Spondee (S)\n\nThe full pattern is **D-S-S-S-D-S**.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
