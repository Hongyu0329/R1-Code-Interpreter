    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient C implementation and then calculating the total memory used by its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe goal is to reorder the numbers in a given sum string (e.g., \"3+1+2\") into non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+2+3\").\n\n*   **Input**: A string `s` containing single-digit numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} separated by '+' signs. The string length is at most 1000 characters.\n*   **Output**: The rearranged sum string.\n*   **Constraint**: The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". We need to find the total memory `m` in bytes used for the variables.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing an Algorithm\nThe numbers are limited to a very small set {1, 2, 3, 4}. This makes **Counting Sort** the ideal algorithm. It is highly efficient in both time and memory for this scenario.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read the input string `s`.\n2.  Iterate through the string, focusing on the numbers at indices 0, 2, 4, etc.\n3.  Count the occurrences of '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n4.  Construct the output string by printing the numbers in sorted order based on the counts, separated by '+'.\n\n### Step 3: Designing the Memory-Efficient C Program\nTo minimize memory, we should:\n1.  Avoid creating a new large array to store the numbers or the output string. We can print the result directly to standard output.\n2.  Use the smallest possible data types for our variables based on the range of values they need to hold. We'll assume standard data type sizes: `sizeof(char) = 1` byte, `sizeof(short) = 2` bytes, and `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Variables and Calculating Memory\nLet's list the variables required for a minimal C program implementing this algorithm and calculate their memory usage.\n\n1.  **Input String Buffer (`s`)**:\n    *   The input string `s` can have a maximum length of 1000.\n    *   To store this string, including the null terminator (`\\0`), we need a character array of size 1001.\n    *   Variable: `char s[1001];`\n    *   Memory: `1001 * sizeof(char)` = `1001 * 1` = **1001 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Counts Array (`counts`)**:\n    *   We need to store the counts for four different numbers (1, 2, 3, 4).\n    *   The maximum number of terms in the sum is `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 500.5`, which rounds up to 501. So, any count can go up to 501.\n    *   A `char` (max value 255) is not sufficient. A `short` (max value 32,767) is the smallest standard type that can hold this value.\n    *   Variable: `short counts[4];`\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Loop Counters (`i`, `j`)**:\n    *   We need a loop counter `i` to iterate through the input string `s`. Its value can go up to 998 (for a string of length 999). A `char` is not sufficient; a `short` is required.\n    *   We need another loop counter `j` for the printing loops. Its value can go up to the maximum count of any number, which is 501. A `short` is required here as well.\n    *   Variables: `short i, j;`\n    *   Memory: `2 * sizeof(short)` = `2 * 2` = **4 bytes**.\n\n4.  **Printing Flag (`first`)**:\n    *   To correctly print the `+` signs (i.e., not before the first number), we can use a simple flag. This flag only needs to store a boolean value (e.g., 1 or 0).\n    *   A `char` is the smallest data type suitable for a flag.\n    *   Variable: `char first;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char)` = `1 * 1` = **1 byte**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nBy summing the memory usage of all necessary variables, we get the total memory `m`.\n\n*   `s`: 1001 bytes\n*   `counts`: 8 bytes\n*   `i` and `j`: 4 bytes\n*   `first`: 1 byte\n\nTotal memory `m` = `1001 + 8 + 4 + 1` = **1014 bytes**.\n\nThis represents the memory allocated on the stack for the variables in a highly optimized C program for this problem.\n\n<<<1014>>>"
