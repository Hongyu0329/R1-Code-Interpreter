**Metal:** Hafnium (Hf)
**Ligand:** A Constrained-Geometry Catalyst (CGC) ligand (e.g., a silicon-bridged cyclopentadienyl-amido framework).
**Support:** A mesoporous gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) support.

This combination is optimal because:
1.  **Hafnium** provides the highest thermal stability among Group IV metals, crucial for the high-temperature hydrogenolysis step.
2.  The **CGC ligand** offers a unique combination of exceptional thermal robustness (due to the chelate effect) and a sterically open active site, which is necessary to accommodate the bulky polymer chain for cleavage while also being highly active for polymerization.
3.  The **γ-Al2O3 support** provides essential site isolation to prevent catalyst deactivation at high temperatures and contributes synergistic Lewis acidity that assists in weakening C-C bonds without destroying the organometallic complex.
