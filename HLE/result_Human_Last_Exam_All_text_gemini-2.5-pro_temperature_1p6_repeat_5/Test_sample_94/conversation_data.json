    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **\"Which physicist...\"**: The answer is the name of a person who was a physicist.\n2.  **\"...better known for work in the microscopy field...\"**: This is a major clue. The physicist's primary contribution or fame is in the area of microscopy. This helps narrow down the list of potential candidates from all of physics.\n3.  **\"...discovered an optical effect in real imagery...\"**: The discovery is a specific physical phenomenon related to optics. \"Real imagery\" refers to images formed by the actual convergence of light rays, which can be projected onto a screen. Concave mirrors, mentioned later, are capable of forming real images.\n4.  **\"...after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker...\"**: This points to a specific and well-known anecdote about the discovery. The physicist was not the first person to see the effect, but the one who understood and explained it.\n5.  **\"...cleaning concave mirrors?\"**: This provides the specific context and equipment involved in the accidental observation.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The question links a famous discovery anecdote (the custodial worker) with a specific field (microscopy). The correct answer must satisfy both conditions.\n*   The physicist is *better known* for microscopy, which implies their discovery might have broader applications but is most famously used in that field.\n*   The terms \"optical effect\" and \"concave mirrors\" are crucial technical details that must match the physicist's work.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Recall the Anecdote**: The story of an optical effect being noticed by a worker polishing mirrors is a famous one in the history of optics. The worker noticed that surface imperfections, dust, and even the heat shimmer from their own hand became starkly visible under certain viewing conditions.\n2.  **Connect the Anecdote to a Principle**: This observation is a classic example of a phase-contrast or schlieren-like effect, where minute variations in optical path length (caused by imperfections, dust, or changes in air refractive index) are converted into visible changes in brightness.\n3.  **Identify Physicists in the Field**: We need to look for a physicist known for developing a microscopy technique based on this principle.\n    *   **Frits Zernike** won the Nobel Prize for inventing the phase-contrast microscope. While he worked with similar principles, the specific anecdote about the custodian and concave mirrors is not typically associated with him.\n    *   **August Toepler** developed the schlieren photography method, which is very closely related to the observed effect. However, he is not primarily known for microscopy.\n    *   **Georges Nomarski** was a Polish-French physicist who is famous for his contributions to microscopy. He invented a type of differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy that is now named after him: **Nomarski microscopy**.\n4.  **Verify the Connection**: The anecdote is widely attributed to Georges Nomarski. The story goes that while he was working at the Institut d'Optique in France, a cleaner pointed out the strange visibility of flaws on concave telescope mirrors they were polishing. Nomarski recognized the phenomenon as an interference effect and was inspired by it, leading to his development of the Nomarski prism, the key component for DIC microscopy.\n5.  **Final Check**:\n    *   Was Georges Nomarski a physicist? Yes.\n    *   Is he better known for microscopy? Yes, for Nomarski (DIC) microscopy.\n    *   Did he discover an optical effect (DIC) related to observations on concave mirrors made by a worker? Yes, this matches the well-known story of his discovery.\n\nTherefore, the physicist described in the question is Georges Nomarski.\n\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"
