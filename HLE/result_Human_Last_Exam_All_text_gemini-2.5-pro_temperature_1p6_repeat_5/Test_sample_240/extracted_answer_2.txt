The most common reason a functional MRI coil shows no resonance on a VNA is that it is being tested in its default, actively detuned state. MRI coils contain safety circuits (using PIN diodes) that make them non-resonant when not actively powered by the scanner with the correct DC bias for receive mode. Other significant possibilities include poor magnetic coupling due to incorrect probe orientation, an intrinsically low unloaded Q-factor creating a very shallow resonance dip, or interference from decoupling networks in phased array coils.
