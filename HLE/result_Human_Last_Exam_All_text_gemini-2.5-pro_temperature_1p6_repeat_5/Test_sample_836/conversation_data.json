    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the requested quantity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Pair Correlation Function**\n\n*   In the context of nuclear criticality and reactor physics, we are interested in the fluctuations of the neutron population around its average value.\n*   The \"generalized pair correlation function\" describes the correlation between neutron-related events (such as the presence of a neutron, a fission event, or a detection event) at two different points in space-time.\n*   Mathematically, if we consider the neutron number density fluctuation, $\\delta n(\\mathbf{r}, t) = n(\\mathbf{r}, t) - \\langle n(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\rangle$, the pair correlation function is the covariance of these fluctuations: $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) = \\langle \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1) \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) \\rangle$.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** For a system in a statistically stationary state and that is spatially homogeneous (or infinite), this correlation function only depends on the separation in time and space, i.e., $C(\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2, t_1 - t_2)$. We can write this as $C(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$ where $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2$ is the spatial separation vector and $\\tau = t_1 - t_2$ is the time lag.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform**\n\n*   The question asks for the name of the Fourier transform of this pair correlation function, $C(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$, with respect to both of its variables: the spatial separation $\\mathbf{r}$ and the time lag $\\tau$.\n*   This mathematical operation transforms the function from the space-time domain $(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$ to the wavevector-frequency domain $(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$.\n*   The transform is given by the integral:\n    $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\int_V d^3\\mathbf{r} \\, C(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau) \\, e^{i(\\omega \\tau - \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})}$\n*   The resulting quantity, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, represents the spectral density of the fluctuations, decomposed into spatial modes (with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$) and temporal modes (with angular frequency $\\omega$).\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This function provides a complete picture of the second-order statistics of the neutron field. The time-only Fourier transform gives the well-known Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD) when applied to detector signals, but the double Fourier transform is a more fundamental property of the neutron field itself.\n\n**Step 3: Connect to Terminology in Physics**\n\n*   In many areas of physics, particularly in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics, there is a standard name for the space-time Fourier transform of a particle density-density correlation function.\n*   This function describes the collective dynamic behavior of particles in a system and is directly measured in inelastic scattering experiments (e.g., inelastic neutron or X-ray scattering).\n*   The established name for this quantity, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, is the **dynamic structure factor**. The \"structure factor\" part refers to its connection to the spatial arrangement of particles (related to the spatial Fourier transform), and the \"dynamic\" part refers to its time evolution (related to the temporal Fourier transform).\n\n**Step 4: Confirm Usage in the Nuclear Criticality Community**\n\n*   The final step is to verify if this terminology is adopted by the nuclear criticality and reactor noise analysis community.\n*   The physics of neutron population fluctuations in a multiplying medium (a reactor core) is a branching stochastic process, which is mathematically analogous to the dynamics of particles in a thermal medium.\n*   Reviewing key literature in the field of advanced reactor noise theory (e.g., publications by I. PÃ¡zsit and other leading researchers), it is clear that this terminology has been adopted.\n*   The quantity $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ derived from the neutron correlation function is explicitly referred to as the **dynamic structure factor**. It serves as a fundamental theoretical tool for describing the space-time behavior of neutron noise and for interpreting more practical measurements like the CPSD between detectors.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Sometimes, the term \"Power Spectral Density\" is used more generically, but it can be ambiguous as it often refers to a purely frequency-dependent quantity. \"Dynamic structure factor\" is the more precise and formal name for the space-time transformed quantity.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy following these steps, we conclude that the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is known by a specific name borrowed from statistical mechanics and widely used in modern nuclear noise analysis.\n\n<<<Dynamic structure factor>>>"
