    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nThe question provides several key pieces of information about a specific individual (\"HE\") and his work.\n\n*   **Interpreter:** The interpretation is attributed to \"Veronika Campan\". This suggests the answer lies within the academic field of theology, religious studies, or philosophy, where Campan is a known scholar. Her work focuses on the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments).\n*   **Location in the work:** The specific action takes place \"at the end of HIS work\". In the context of the Ten Commandments, \"the end\" refers to the final commandments.\n*   **The Action:** The individual \"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\". The Ten Commandments address this in the prohibitions against theft (Eighth) and coveting (Tenth). The word \"separately\" is crucial, implying a unique division or treatment of this topic.\n*   **The Method:** The most telling clue is that \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" The \"prohibition against representation\" is a clear reference to the Second Commandment in the Jewish and Reformed Christian traditions, which forbids the creation of graven images or idols. \"Ignoring\" it means that in his specific ordering or interpretation of the Commandments, this prohibition loses its status as a distinct, separate commandment.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the Clues and Formulate a Hypothesis**\n\nWe are looking for a famous theologian whose system for organizing the Ten Commandments involves two key changes from the original Hebrew Bible structure (as found in Exodus 20):\n\n1.  He combines the prohibition against other gods and the prohibition against making idols into a single commandment. This action constitutes \"ignoring the prohibition against representation\" as a separate rule.\n2.  To maintain the total number of commandments at ten, he must split another commandment into two. He does this \"at the end\" by dividing the commandment against coveting. This division allows him to \"separately address the issue of another's material possessions\".\n\nThis specific arrangement of the Decalogue is famously attributed to one major figure in the history of Christian theology.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Individual**\n\nThe theologian who proposed this structure is **Augustine of Hippo** (also known as Saint Augustine).\n\n*   **Augustine's Reordering of the Decalogue:** Augustine argued that the prohibitions against worshipping other gods and making graven images were two parts of the same core idea: to worship the one true God alone. He therefore combined them into the First Commandment.\n*   **Consequence of the Reordering:** To preserve the count of ten commandments, Augustine split the final commandment. He designated the prohibition against coveting a neighbor's wife as the Ninth Commandment, and the prohibition against coveting a neighbor's house and other **material possessions** as a separate Tenth Commandment.\n*   **Meeting All Criteria:** This system perfectly matches the clues. At the \"end\" of his list, Augustine \"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\" (the 10th Commandment). He was able to do this because he made room at the start of the list by merging the first two, thereby \"ignoring\" or subsuming the standalone \"prohibition against representation.\" This theological restructuring became the standard for the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions.\n\nTherefore, the full name of the individual described is Augustine of Hippo.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
