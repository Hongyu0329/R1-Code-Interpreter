    "This is a letter sequence puzzle. To solve it, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence and look for obvious patterns.**\nThe sequence is `Z X X C V Y B N _`.\nThe letters are not in alphabetical order, nor do their numerical positions in the alphabet follow a simple mathematical rule.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a less obvious pattern, possibly related to external knowledge.**\nA common source for patterns in such puzzles is the QWERTY keyboard layout.\nLet's examine the positions of the letters on a standard keyboard:\n*   Top row: `Q W E R T Y U I O P`\n*   Middle row: `A S D F G H J K L`\n*   Bottom row: `Z X C V B N M`\n\nWe can observe that most of the letters in the sequence (`Z, X, C, V, B, N`) come from the bottom row of the keyboard, and they appear in the same order as on the keyboard.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis based on this observation.**\nThe sequence appears to be constructed from the letters of the bottom row of the keyboard, with some other letters inserted into the sequence.\nLet's break the sequence down based on this idea. The base sequence is `Z, X, C, V, B, N, ...`\nThe given sequence is `Z X X C V Y B N _`.\n\nWe can group the sequence into threes:\n*   Group 1: `Z X X`\n*   Group 2: `C V Y`\n*   Group 3: `B N _`\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the structure of the groups.**\nEach group seems to consist of two consecutive letters from the keyboard's bottom row, followed by a third, \"inserted\" letter.\n*   Group 1: `(Z, X)` are the first two letters of the bottom row. The inserted letter is `X`.\n*   Group 2: `(C, V)` are the next two letters of the bottom row. The inserted letter is `Y`.\n*   Group 3: `(B, N)` are the next two letters of the bottom row. We need to find the inserted letter `_`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the rule for the inserted letter.**\nLet's analyze the insertion rule for the first two groups to predict the third.\n*   **Insertion 1:** For the pair `(Z, X)`, the inserted letter is `X`. This is a repeat of the second letter in the pair. Let's call this the \"repeat rule\".\n*   **Insertion 2:** For the pair `(C, V)`, the inserted letter is `Y`. This does not follow the \"repeat rule\" (which would have given `V`). This is a different, special rule.\n*   **Insertion 3:** For the pair `(B, N)`, we need to determine which rule applies.\n\nA common feature in sequence puzzles is an alternating pattern. It's plausible that the insertion rule alternates between the \"repeat rule\" and the \"special rule\".\n*   Group 1 uses the **repeat rule**.\n*   Group 2 uses the **special rule**.\n*   Group 3 should therefore use the **repeat rule** again.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the determined rule to find the next letter.**\nThe third group is `(B, N)`. We need to apply the \"repeat rule\". This rule states that we should repeat the second letter of the pair. The second letter is `N`.\nTherefore, the letter that should appear next is `N`.\n\nThe full sequence would be `Z X X C V Y B N N`.\n\n<<<N>>>"
