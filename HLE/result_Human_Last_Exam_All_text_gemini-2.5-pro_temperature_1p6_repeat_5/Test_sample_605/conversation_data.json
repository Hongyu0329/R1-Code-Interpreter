    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Inputs\n\nWe are given a Calabi-Yau threefold defined by a polynomial equation in a weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n*   **Polynomial:** $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$\n*   **Weights:** $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$\n\nOur goal is to compute the Crawley-Nordström invariant, denoted $c_X$.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition and Check for Inconsistencies\n\nA hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, \\dots, w_5)$ is Calabi-Yau if its weighted degree, $d$, equals the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$.\nThe sum of weights is $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\nFor the polynomial to define such a hypersurface, it must be weighted homogeneous of degree $d=225$. Let's check the degree of each monomial:\n*   `deg`(z₁⁸z₃) = 8 * w₁ + w₃ = 8 * 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225.\n*   `deg`(z₁⁴z₂³z₃) = 4 * w₁ + 3 * w₂ + w₃ = 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224. **(Inconsistent)**\n*   `deg`(z₁z₂⁷) = 1 * w₁ + 7 * w₂ = 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = 225.\n*   `deg`(z₁z₂z₃z₄z₅) = w₁ + w₂ + w₃ + w₄ + w₅ = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225.\n*   `deg`(z₂z₃⁴) = 1 * w₂ + 4 * w₃ = 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = 225.\n*   `deg`(z₄³z₅) = 3 * w₄ + w₅ = 3 * 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225.\n*   `deg`(z₅³) = 3 * w₅ = 3 * 75 = 225.\n\n**Careful Point:** The term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a weighted degree of 224, not 225. This means the given polynomial is not weighted homogeneous and the problem statement has a typo. However, we will proceed with the calculation, as this term's presence or absence does not affect the final set of weights we will use for the invariant.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Crawley-Nordström Invariant\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, $c_X$, is the least common multiple (lcm) of the weights of all variables that appear in any of the \"singular monomials\" of the defining polynomial $F$.\n\nA monomial $m$ is considered a **singular monomial** if, after setting all variables present in $m$ to zero, the polynomial $F$ does not vanish identically.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Singular Monomials and Collect Their Weights\n\nWe will test each monomial in the given polynomial $F$.\n\n1.  **Monomial $m_1 = z_1^8z_3$**:\n    *   Variables: $z_1, z_3$. Set $z_1=0, z_3=0$.\n    *   $F|_{z_1=0, z_3=0} = z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3$. This is not the zero polynomial.\n    *   Therefore, $m_1$ is a singular monomial. The weights of its variables are $\\{w_1, w_3\\} = \\{22, 49\\}$.\n\n2.  **Monomial $m_2 = z_1^4z_2^3z_3$** (the inconsistent term):\n    *   Variables: $z_1, z_2, z_3$. Set $z_1=0, z_2=0, z_3=0$.\n    *   $F|_{z_1=0, z_2=0, z_3=0} = z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3$. This is not zero.\n    *   Therefore, $m_2$ is a singular monomial. The weights are $\\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\} = \\{22, 29, 49\\}$.\n\n3.  **Monomial $m_3 = z_1z_2^7$**:\n    *   Variables: $z_1, z_2$. Set $z_1=0, z_2=0$.\n    *   $F|_{z_1=0, z_2=0} = z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3$. This is not zero.\n    *   Therefore, $m_3$ is a singular monomial. The weights are $\\{w_1, w_2\\} = \\{22, 29\\}$.\n\n4.  **Monomial $m_4 = z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$**:\n    *   Variables: $z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5$. Setting all variables to zero.\n    *   $F|_{z_1=z_2=z_3=z_4=z_5=0} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $m_4$ is **not** a singular monomial.\n\n5.  **Monomial $m_5 = z_2z_3^4$**:\n    *   Variables: $z_2, z_3$. Set $z_2=0, z_3=0$.\n    *   $F|_{z_2=0, z_3=0} = z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3$. This is not zero.\n    *   Therefore, $m_5$ is a singular monomial. The weights are $\\{w_2, w_3\\} = \\{29, 49\\}$.\n\n6.  **Monomial $m_6 = z_4^3z_5$**:\n    *   Variables: $z_4, z_5$. Set $z_4=0, z_5=0$.\n    *   $F|_{z_4=0, z_5=0} = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_2z_3^4$. This is not zero.\n    *   Therefore, $m_6$ is a singular monomial. The weights are $\\{w_4, w_5\\} = \\{50, 75\\}$.\n\n7.  **Monomial $m_7 = z_5^3$**:\n    *   Variable: $z_5$. Set $z_5=0$.\n    *   $F|_{z_5=0} = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_2z_3^4$. This is not zero.\n    *   Therefore, $m_7$ is a singular monomial. The weight is $\\{w_5\\} = \\{75\\}$.\n\nNow, we collect all the weights from the variables of the singular monomials:\n$S_w = \\{22, 49\\} \\cup \\{22, 29, 49\\} \\cup \\{22, 29\\} \\cup \\{29, 49\\} \\cup \\{50, 75\\} \\cup \\{75\\}$\n$S_w = \\{22, 29, 49, 50, 75\\}$.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Least Common Multiple (lcm)\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is $c_X = \\text{lcm}(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\nTo compute the lcm, we first find the prime factorization of each number in the set:\n*   $22 = 2 \\times 11$\n*   $29 = 29$ (prime number)\n*   $49 = 7^2$\n*   $50 = 2 \\times 5^2$\n*   $75 = 3 \\times 5^2$\n\nThe lcm is the product of the highest power of each prime factor present in these factorizations.\n*   Highest power of 2: $2^1$\n*   Highest power of 3: $3^1$\n*   Highest power of 5: $5^2$\n*   Highest power of 7: $7^2$\n*   Highest power of 11: $11^1$\n*   Highest power of 29: $29^1$\n\n$c_X = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2 \\times 11^1 \\times 29^1$\n$c_X = 2 \\times 3 \\times 25 \\times 49 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n$c_X = 6 \\times 25 \\times 49 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n$c_X = 150 \\times 49 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n$c_X = 7350 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n$c_X = 80850 \\times 29$\n$c_X = 2,344,650$\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is 2,344,650.\n\n<<<2344650>>>"
