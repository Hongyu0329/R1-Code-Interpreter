    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Statement**\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nThe key conditions are that their first derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\n\n**2. Translate the Problem into a Polynomial Equation**\nA fixed point of $f(g(x))$ is a solution to the equation:\n$f(g(x)) = x$\n\nTo find the number of fixed points, we need to find the number of real roots of the polynomial equation:\n$P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$\n\n**3. Analyze the Properties of f(x) and g(x)**\n*   **Degree:** Both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are degree 3 polynomials. Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ and $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with $a \\neq 0$ and $p \\neq 0$.\n*   **Derivatives:**\n    *   $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.\n    *   $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$.\n*   **Condition $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$:**\n    *   For a quadratic polynomial $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, it must open upwards ($A>0$) and have no real roots (discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$).\n    *   For $f'(x) > 0$: We must have $3a > 0$, which implies $a > 0$. Also, the discriminant $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0$.\n    *   For $g'(x) > 0$: We must have $3p > 0$, which implies $p > 0$. Also, the discriminant $(2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0$.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The conditions imply that the leading coefficients of both polynomials, $a$ and $p$, must be positive. This also means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**4. Determine the Degree of the Equation $P(x)=0$**\n*   The function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a composition of two polynomials. Its degree is the product of their degrees: $\\text{deg}(h) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The leading term of $g(x)$ is $px^3$.\n*   The leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a(px^3)^3 = a p^3 x^9$.\n*   Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is non-zero.\n*   Therefore, the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = ap^3x^9 + ... - x$ is of degree 9.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. This gives us an initial upper bound for the number of fixed points.\n\n**5. Use Rolle's Theorem to Refine the Bound (or Confirm it)**\nRolle's Theorem states that between any two real roots of a differentiable function, there must be at least one real root of its derivative. This implies that if the $k$-th derivative of a function has at most $m$ real roots, the function itself can have at most $m+k$ real roots. We will apply this to $P(x)$.\n\nLet's find the second derivative of $P(x)$.\n*   $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n*   $P''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x)) = f''(g(x)) \\cdot [g'(x)]^2 + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$.\n\n**6. Determine the Degree of $P''(x)$**\nLet's find the degrees of the components of $P''(x)$:\n*   $f(x)$ is degree 3 $\\implies f'(x)$ is degree 2 $\\implies f''(x)$ is degree 1.\n*   $g(x)$ is degree 3 $\\implies g'(x)$ is degree 2 $\\implies g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two terms in the expression for $P''(x)$:\n*   **Term 1: $f''(g(x)) \\cdot [g'(x)]^2$**\n    *   $\\text{deg}(f''(g(x)))$ = $\\text{deg}(f'') \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}([g'(x)]^2)$ = $2 \\times \\text{deg}(g') = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(\\text{Term 1}) = 3 + 4 = 7$.\n    *   The leading term of Term 1 is $(6a g(x)) \\cdot (3px^2)^2 \\approx (6apx^3)(9p^2x^4) = 54ap^3x^7$.\n\n*   **Term 2: $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$**\n    *   $\\text{deg}(f'(g(x)))$ = $\\text{deg}(f') \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(g''(x)) = 1$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(\\text{Term 2}) = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   The leading term of Term 2 is $(3a (g(x))^2) \\cdot (6px) \\approx (3a(px^3)^2)(6px) = (3ap^2x^6)(6px) = 18ap^3x^7$.\n\n*   **Degree of $P''(x)$:** Since both terms have the same degree (7), the leading term of $P''(x)$ is the sum of their leading terms:\n    $54ap^3x^7 + 18ap^3x^7 = 72ap^3x^7$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $72ap^3$ is not zero. Therefore, $P''(x)$ is a polynomial of exactly degree 7.\n\n**7. Final Application of Rolle's Theorem**\n1.  Since $P''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, it can have at most 7 real roots.\n2.  According to Rolle's Theorem, $P'(x)$ can have at most $7 + 1 = 8$ real roots.\n3.  Applying Rolle's Theorem again, $P(x)$ can have at most $8 + 1 = 9$ real roots.\n\n**8. Conclusion**\nOur analysis, using the degree of the second derivative, confirms that the number of fixed points cannot exceed 9. Since this matches the maximum number of roots possible for a degree-9 polynomial, and we have found no further constraints that would reduce this number, the maximum number of fixed points is 9. It is generally possible to construct polynomials with coefficients chosen to place the roots of their derivatives in such a way as to maximize the number of roots of the original polynomial, reaching the algebraic limit.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is the maximum number of real roots of the degree-9 polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$, which is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
