    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nFirst, we must determine the linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark when viewed as a matrix. The problem states that we should choose the values in the matrix to maximize the rank.\n\n1.  **Structure of the Danish Flag:** The flag of Denmark has a red field with a white Nordic cross. This means it is composed of two colors: red and white.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** We can represent the flag as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a point on the flag. Let the red color be represented by a scalar value `r` and the white color by a scalar value `w`. To maximize the rank, we must choose `r` and `w` such that they are linearly independent (e.g., `r=1`, `w=2`, or more generally, `r ≠ w` and `r, w ≠ 0`).\n3.  **Identifying Row Types:** A row in this matrix can have one of two structures:\n    *   A row that does not intersect the horizontal bar of the cross will be a mix of red and white, following the pattern of the vertical bar of the cross (e.g., `[r, r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r, r]`).\n    *   A row that corresponds to the horizontal bar of the cross will be entirely white (e.g., `[w, w, w, ..., w, w]`).\n4.  **Calculating the Rank:** Let's denote the \"all-white\" row vector as `V_w` and the \"mixed red/white\" row vector as `V_rw`.\n    *   `V_w` is a vector where every element is `w`. It can be written as `w * u`, where `u` is a vector of all ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`).\n    *   `V_rw` is a vector with mostly `r`'s and some `w`'s. For example, `[r, r, w, r, r]`.\n    *   The row space of the matrix is spanned by these two types of vectors. Are they linearly independent? We need to check if `c1 * V_rw + c2 * V_w = 0` implies `c1=c2=0`. If we choose `r=1, w=2`, the vectors might look like `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` and `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. These two vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent.\n    *   Therefore, the basis for the row space has two vectors. The maximal rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify African Flags with a Maximal Rank of 2\n\nWe are looking for flags of African nations that, when analyzed in the same way, also have a maximal rank of 2. This means their structure must generate exactly two linearly independent row types.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags composed solely of horizontal or vertical bands of solid color will have a rank of 1. This is because every row (for horizontal bands) or column (for vertical bands) will be a scalar multiple of the vector of all ones `u`. Examples: Nigeria (vertical green-white-green), Mauritius (horizontal multi-color stripes), Gabon (horizontal stripes).\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:** Flags with complex geometric patterns involving three or more colors, or complex two-color patterns like stars on a solid field, will often generate three or more linearly independent row types, resulting in a rank of 3 or higher. Examples: Somalia (blue field, white star), Morocco (red field, green star), Democratic Republic of the Congo (diagonal stripes).\n\nBased on this, we search for flags whose structure is more complex than simple stripes but not so complex as to generate more than two independent row types. This typically involves flags with horizontal stripes plus one additional feature.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Candidate Flags\n\n1.  **Angola:** The flag has a horizontal bicolor of red and black. In the center is a yellow emblem (a machete and cogwheel) that straddles the red and black areas.\n    *   Row types: All-red (`r*u`), all-black (`k*u`), red with yellow emblem (`V_ry`), black with yellow emblem (`V_ky`).\n    *   The `r*u` and `k*u` vectors are linearly dependent (multiples of `u`). The set `{u, V_ry, V_ky}` can be shown to span a 2D space. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Burkina Faso:** The flag has a horizontal bicolor of red and green with a yellow star in the center, straddling the two bands.\n    *   The structure is identical to Angola's. By the same logic, the rank is 2.\n\n3.  **Egypt:** The flag has horizontal stripes of red, white, and black. In the center of the white stripe is the golden Eagle of Saladin.\n    *   Row types: All-red (`r*u`), all-black (`k*u`), and white with the gold eagle (`V_we`).\n    *   The all-red and all-black rows are dependent (multiples of `u`). The row space is spanned by `{u, V_we}`, which are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n4.  **Libya:** The flag has horizontal stripes of red, black, and green. In the center of the wider black stripe is a white crescent and star.\n    *   The structure is analogous to Egypt's flag. By the same logic, the rank is 2.\n\n5.  **Malawi:** The flag has horizontal stripes of black, red, and green. In the top black stripe is a red rising sun.\n    *   Row types: Black with a red emblem (`V_kr`), all-red (`r*u`), all-green (`g*u`). The all-black rows are also present.\n    *   The rows with solid colors (`k*u`, `r*u`, `g*u`) are all multiples of `u`. The space is spanned by `{u, V_kr}`. The rank is 2.\n\n6.  **Rwanda:** The flag has three horizontal bands of blue, yellow, and green. In the upper right of the blue band is a yellow sun.\n    *   Row types: Blue with a yellow sun (`V_by`), all-yellow (`y*u`), all-green (`g*u`).\n    *   The all-yellow and all-green rows are multiples of `u`. The row space is spanned by `{u, V_by}`. The rank is 2.\n\n7.  **Sudan:** The flag has horizontal stripes of red, white, and black, with a green triangle at the hoist.\n    *   Row types: Rows with only a single color (`r*u`, `w*u`, `k*u`) and rows that are a mix of green (from the triangle) and another color (`V_gr`, `V_gw`, `V_gk`).\n    -   The set of all these row types can be shown to span a 2-dimensional space. The basis can be formed by `{u, V_gr}`, for example. The rank is 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe African nations whose flags have the same linear algebraic rank (rank 2) as the flag of Denmark are those with a structure that generates exactly two linearly independent row types. Following the analysis, these nations are:\n\n**Angola, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Libya, Malawi, Rwanda, and Sudan.**\n\n<<<Angola, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Libya, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan>>>"
