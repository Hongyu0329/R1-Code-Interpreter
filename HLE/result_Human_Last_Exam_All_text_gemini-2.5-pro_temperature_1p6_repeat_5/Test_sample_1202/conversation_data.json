    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism that explains two outcomes for genes that have been duplicated in a genome:\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies of the gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than one copy being lost or disabled.\n    *   **Divergence:** The two copies become different from each other in their DNA sequence and, consequently, their function or regulation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    Immediately after a gene duplication event, the organism has two identical copies of a gene. This situation is called redundancy. Since one copy is usually sufficient to perform the original function, the second copy is often not under strong selective pressure to remain functional. This means it can accumulate mutations without harming the organism.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, it tends to make the two copies more similar or even identical. Therefore, gene conversion actively works *against* divergence. It does not explain how two copies become different and are retained as distinct functional genes.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene. One copy accumulates deleterious or loss-of-function mutations and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene.\" While this process involves divergence (the pseudogene's sequence changes), it is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not the *retention* of two functional genes. The question asks for a mechanism of retention.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that result in a completely new, beneficial function.\n        *   **Retention:** The original copy is retained for its original role, and the new copy is retained because its new function provides a selective advantage.\n        *   **Divergence:** The accumulation of mutations to create a new function inherently causes the two copies to diverge.\n        *   This is a valid and important mechanism, but it relies on the occurrence of a rare gain-of-function mutation, which must also be beneficial to be selected for.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model applies when the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or complex regulation (e.g., expressed in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy can accumulate loss-of-function mutations that disable different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps function B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps function A.\n        *   **Retention:** Now, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. Losing either copy would be detrimental. This \"complementation\" ensures both copies are retained by purifying selection.\n        *   **Divergence:** The degenerative mutations that knock out different subfunctions cause the sequences (especially regulatory regions) of the two genes to diverge.\n        *   This is a highly plausible mechanism because it relies on common loss-of-function mutations rather than rare gain-of-function ones. It provides an immediate selective reason to keep both copies, rescuing them from the more likely fate of pseudogenization.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern where a lineage rapidly diversifies to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not itself a *molecular mechanism* for retaining and diverging individual genes within a genome. It describes a phenomenon at the species or population level.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Distinguishing between common and rare events:** Pseudogenization is the most common *outcome* overall, but it's not a mechanism for *retaining* functional duplicates.\n*   **Comparing Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization:** Both are valid mechanisms for retention and divergence. The key is the phrase \"most likely.\" The mutational path to subfunctionalization (breaking parts of an existing function) is generally considered much more probable and frequent than the path to neofunctionalization (creating a novel function).\n*   **The DDC model's strength:** The subfunctionalization (DDC) model elegantly solves the problem of how a redundant gene copy is maintained long enough to evolve. By partitioning existing functions, it immediately makes both copies essential, thus protecting them from being lost.\n\nTherefore, because it relies on more frequent mutational events (loss-of-function) to create a situation where both genes are necessary, subfunctionalization is considered the most likely general mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
