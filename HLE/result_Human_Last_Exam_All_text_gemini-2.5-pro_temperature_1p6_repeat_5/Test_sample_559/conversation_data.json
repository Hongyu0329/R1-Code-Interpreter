    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points:**\n    The system of differential equations is:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n    $u' = u^2(u - 1)$\n\n    Equilibrium points $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{d})$ are found by setting $u' = 0$ and $d' = 0$.\n    From $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $\\bar{u} = 0$ or $\\bar{u} = 1$.\n\n    *   If $\\bar{u} = 0$: Substitute into $d' = 0$.\n        $2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies \\bar{d} = 0$.\n        So, $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{d}) = (0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n    *   If $\\bar{u} = 1$: Substitute into $d' = 0$.\n        $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n        This gives $\\bar{d} = 0$ or $\\bar{d} = -1$.\n        So, $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{d}) = (1, 0)$ and $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{d}) = (1, -1)$ are two more equilibrium points.\n\n    We have three equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$: $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points:**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix of the system $\\mathbf{f}(u, d) = (u', d')^T$:\n    $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Since the Jacobian is a lower triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries:\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n\n    Now, we evaluate the eigenvalues at each equilibrium point:\n    *   At $(0, 0)$: $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$. This is a degenerate point (non-hyperbolic), so linearization is not conclusive.\n    *   At $(1, 0)$: $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = 2$. Both eigenvalues are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (source).\n    *   At $(1, -1)$: $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = -4 + 5 - 3 = -2$. The eigenvalues have opposite signs, so $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n3.  **Identify separatrices:**\n    Separatrices are trajectories that separate regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. We have a saddle point at $(1, -1)$.\n\n4.  **Find the manifolds of the saddle point $(1, -1)$:**\n    The stable and unstable manifolds are curves that are tangent to the eigenvectors of the Jacobian at the saddle point.\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) + 4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   **Unstable manifold ($\\lambda_1 = 1$):** The eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_1$ is found by $(J - 1 \\cdot I)\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{0} \\implies -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$.\n        The eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -2)^T$. The slope of the unstable manifold at $(1, -1)$ is $-2/1 = -2$.\n    *   **Stable manifold ($\\lambda_2 = -2$):** The eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_2$ is found by $(J - (-2) \\cdot I)\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{0} \\implies 3v_u = 0 \\implies v_u = 0$.\n        The eigenvector is proportional to $(0, 1)^T$. The stable manifold is tangent to the vertical line $u=1$ at $(1, -1)$. In fact, by analyzing the flow on the line $u=1$ (where $u'=0$), one can see the stable manifold is the line segment and ray $\\{ (u,d) | u=1, d<0 \\}$.\n\n5.  **Search for an invariant algebraic curve for the unstable manifold:**\n    We look for a curve $d=f(u)$ that is a trajectory of the system. Let's test a simple polynomial form, $d=au^2+bu+c$. By checking the equilibrium points the curve might pass through, like $(0,0)$ and $(1,-1)$, we can deduce likely candidates for the coefficients. Let's test the curve $d = -u^2$.\n    If $d = -u^2$, then $d' = -2u u'$.\n    Substitute this into the first differential equation:\n    $-2u u' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1 - u)$\n    Substitute $u' = u^2(u - 1) = u^3 - u^2$:\n    $-2u(u^3 - u^2) = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n    $-2u^4 + 2u^3 = (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3$\n    $-2u^4 + 2u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n    This is an identity, so $d = -u^2$ is an invariant curve (a trajectory).\n\n6.  **Verify that $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle:**\n    *   The curve passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$ since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n    *   The derivative of the curve is $\\frac{d(d)}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$. This matches the slope of the unstable eigenvector at $(1,-1)$.\n    *   Therefore, the parabola $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$. As the unstable manifold of a saddle, it is a key separatrix of the system.\n\n    It is worth noting that there is another separatrix, $d=u-u^2$, which emanates from the unstable node $(1,0)$. However, the manifolds associated with saddle points are generally considered the primary separatrices as they form the boundaries of the basins of attraction (or regions of qualitatively different flows). Given the singular \"the separatrix\", the unstable manifold of the saddle is the most appropriate answer.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution trajectory of the system. It is the unstable manifold of the only saddle point in the specified domain. Therefore, it is the primary separatrix.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
