    "This problem requires us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length and create the most memory-efficient C program to solve it. We need to calculate the total memory `m` in bytes used by the variables in this optimal program.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Task**: The primary goal is to compare two strings, let's call them `s1` and `s2`. The comparison must be case-insensitive, meaning 'a' is equal to 'A', 'b' to 'B', and so on. We need to output -1 if `s1 < s2`, 1 if `s1 > s2`, and 0 if `s1 == s2`.\n\n2.  **Developing a Comparison Strategy**:\n    *   Lexicographical comparison involves checking characters from left to right.\n    *   The loop should proceed character by character for both strings simultaneously.\n    *   At each position `i`, we compare the character `s1[i]` with `s2[i]`.\n    *   To handle case-insensitivity, we must convert both characters to a common case (either lowercase or uppercase) before comparing them. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for this.\n    *   The first position `i` where `tolower(s1[i])` and `tolower(s2[i])` differ determines the result. If `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])`, the first string is smaller. If `tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2[i])`, the first string is larger.\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding any differences, the strings are considered equal. Since the problem guarantees the strings are of the same length, we don't need to worry about one being a prefix of the other.\n\n3.  **Designing for Memory Efficiency**: The main challenge is to minimize the memory used by variables.\n    *   **Standard Approach**: A straightforward method would be to declare two character arrays, one for each string. Given the maximum length of 100, this would look like:\n        ```c\n        char s1[101]; // 100 chars + 1 for null terminator\n        char s2[101]; // 100 chars + 1 for null terminator\n        ```\n        This uses `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the string buffers, which is not optimal.\n\n    *   **Memory-Optimal Strategy**: We need to see if we can avoid storing both strings. Standard input is a sequential stream. We must read the first string before the program can access the second string. This means we *must* store the first string in a buffer to have it available for comparison while we process the second one. However, we do *not* need to store the entire second string. We can read the second string one character at a time and perform the comparison on-the-fly against the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n\n    *   **Implementation of the Optimal Strategy**:\n        1.  Declare a buffer `s1` to store the first string. Its size must be `100 + 1 = 101` bytes.\n        2.  Read the first string from input into `s1`.\n        3.  Iterate from the beginning of `s1` using an index `i`.\n        4.  In each iteration, read just *one* character from the input stream. This character will belong to the second string. Store it in a temporary character variable, say `c2`.\n        5.  Compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(c2)`. If a difference is found, print the result (`-1` or `1`) and terminate the program.\n        6.  If the loop completes, it means all characters were equal, so we print `0`.\n\n4.  **Minimizing Variable Sizes**: To further reduce memory, we must choose the smallest possible data types for our variables.\n    *   **String Buffer (`s1`)**: This requires `char s1[101];`, which is `101 * sizeof(char) = 101 * 1 = 101` bytes. This is unavoidable.\n    *   **Loop Index (`i`)**: The string length is between 1 and 100. A standard `int` (typically 4 bytes) is not necessary. A `char` variable (1 byte) can hold values from 0 up to 127 (or 255 if unsigned), which is sufficient for our index `i`.\n    *   **Second String Character (`c2`)**: We only need to hold one character at a time from the second string, so a `char` variable (1 byte) is perfect.\n    *   **Intermediate Comparison Variables**: We can avoid using extra variables to store the lowercase versions of the characters by performing the `tolower()` conversion directly inside the `if` conditions.\n\n5.  **Final Memory Calculation**:\n    Based on the most memory-efficient design, the variables required are:\n    *   A character array for the first string: `char s1[101];` -> **101 bytes**\n    *   A character variable for the loop index: `char i;` -> **1 byte**\n    *   A character variable for the current character of the second string: `char c2;` -> **1 byte**\n\n    Total memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = **103 bytes**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis concludes that the most memory-efficient C program for this problem requires one buffer of 101 bytes to store the first string, a 1-byte character variable for the loop index, and another 1-byte character variable to read the second string character by character.\n\nm = 101 (for the first string buffer) + 1 (for the loop index) + 1 (for the second string's character) = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
