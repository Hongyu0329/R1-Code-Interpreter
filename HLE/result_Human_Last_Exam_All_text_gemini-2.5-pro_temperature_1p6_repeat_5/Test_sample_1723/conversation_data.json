    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the scientific name of a **single genus** of mushroom. The defining characteristic of this genus is that it produces a **distinctly blue spore print**.\n\n2.  **Understand Spore Prints:** A spore print is a fundamental tool in mycology (the study of fungi) for identifying mushrooms. It is created by placing the cap of a mushroom, gills-down, on a surface (often white or black paper to provide contrast) and allowing its microscopic spores to fall and accumulate. The resulting color of this spore deposit is a key taxonomic feature.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Spore Print Colors:** Common spore print colors include white, cream, pink, salmon, yellow, rusty-orange, various shades of brown, purple-brown, and black. A blue spore print is exceptionally rare, which is why the question specifies a \"single genus.\"\n\n4.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** We must search for a mushroom genus known for this unique trait. General knowledge in mycology points towards a specific, large genus that contains a small subgroup with this characteristic.\n\n5.  **Isolate the Correct Genus:** The genus known for having species that produce a blue or blue-green spore print is ***Entoloma***. While the majority of species within the vast *Entoloma* genus have a characteristic pinkish or salmon-colored spore print (the \"entolomatoid\" pink), a specific sub-group (subgenus *Leptonia*) contains species with this rare blue coloration. Examples include *Entoloma nitidum* and *Entoloma indigoferum*.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Mushroom Color vs. Spore Print Color:** This is the most critical distinction. Many mushrooms have blue coloration on their caps, stems, or flesh, but this does not mean their spore print is blue. A famous example is the Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*), which is a striking blue mushroom but produces a cream to yellowish spore print. The question is specifically about the color of the spores, not the mushroom itself.\n2.  **The \"Single Genus\" Qualification:** While science is always evolving, *Entoloma* is currently recognized by mycologists as the only genus containing species that produce a truly blue spore print.\n3.  **Variation within the Genus:** It is important to remember that not all mushrooms in the genus *Entoloma* have blue spores. In fact, most do not. The trait is confined to a particular lineage within this large and diverse genus.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy following the steps and considering the careful points, we can confidently identify the single genus known to produce a blue spore print. The rarity of this trait makes it a well-known exception in the world of mycology.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
