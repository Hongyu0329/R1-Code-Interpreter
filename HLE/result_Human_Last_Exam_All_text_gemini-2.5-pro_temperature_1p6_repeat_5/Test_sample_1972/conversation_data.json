    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues\nThe question provides three key pieces of information, all attributed to the writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  **The Author:** Described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n2.  **The Novel's Quality 1:** It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger.\"\n3.  **The Novel's Quality 2:** It has \"the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\nOur goal is to find the author and novel that fit all three of these descriptions according to Borges.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" Clue\n*   **Continuator of Faulkner:** William Faulkner was a highly influential American modernist known for his complex narrative structures, non-linear timelines, stream-of-consciousness style, and creation of a detailed fictional county (Yoknapatawpha). A \"continuator\" would be a writer who worked with similar themes and techniques. This strongly points towards a 20th-century author from the Americas, particularly Latin America, where Faulkner's influence was profound.\n*   **Simplifier of Faulkner:** Faulkner's prose is famously dense, long-winded, and \"baroque.\" A \"simplifier\" would be an author who took Faulkner's structural complexity but applied it with a more concise, sparse, or laconic style. This contrast is a very specific and helpful clue.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Novel's Description\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This metaphor suggests something visceral, fierce, powerful, and potentially violent or predatory. It speaks to the novel's emotional impact and tone—it is not a gentle or placid book.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This metaphor points to intellectual complexity and intricate structure. A chess game is governed by strict rules but allows for nearly infinite variation in strategy and outcomes. It implies the novel is meticulously constructed, with a plot that unfolds like a strategic game, requiring the reader's careful attention to understand its moves and ultimate design.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Connect them to Borges\nWe are looking for a novel that Borges admired, written by a Latin American author influenced by Faulkner but with a sparser style. The novel must be both intensely powerful and structurally complex.\n\nThis specific combination of praise points directly to one of Borges's most famous pieces of literary criticism: his prologue to the 1961 edition of the novel **Pedro Páramo** by the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**.\n\n### Step 5: Verify with the Source\nLet's check if Borges's prologue for *Pedro Páramo* matches the clues:\n*   **On Faulkner:** Borges explicitly addresses the comparison between Rulfo and Faulkner, noting that while the influence is there, Rulfo's work is profoundly different. He describes Rulfo's style as laconic and less \"baroque\" than Faulkner's, which perfectly aligns with the \"simplifier\" description.\n*   **On the Novel's Structure:** Borges praises the book's construction. While the exact wording might vary in translation, he uses the specific metaphor of a chess game. He writes that the novel possesses *\"la variedad que puede alcanzar una partida de ajedrez\"* (\"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\").\n*   **On the Novel's Tone:** *Pedro Páramo* is a dark, haunting, and often brutal story about a man searching for his father in a town populated by the whispering ghosts of its dead inhabitants. The atmosphere is oppressive and the underlying story is one of tyranny and decay, fitting the metaphor of the \"intensity of a tiger.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** All clues point conclusively to Juan Rulfo's novel *Pedro Páramo*.\n\n<<<The novel is *Pedro Páramo* by Juan Rulfo.>>>"
