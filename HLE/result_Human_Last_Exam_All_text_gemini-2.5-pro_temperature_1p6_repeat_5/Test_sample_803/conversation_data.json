    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find all nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set (A):** A subset `A` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `A` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `A`. This can be written as `A \\cap (A \\cdot A) = \\emptyset`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (A):** A product-free set `A` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, for any element `g \\in G \\setminus A`, the set `A \\cup \\{g\\}` is not product-free.\n*   **A Fills G:** A set `A` fills `G` if the subgroup generated by `A`, denoted `<A>`, is the entire group `G`.\n*   **Filled Group (G):** A finite group `G` is filled if *every* maximal by inclusion product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Group G**\n\nThe order of `G` is `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime. We use the Sylow Theorems to determine the structure of `G`.\n\n1.  Let `P` be a Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`. Its order is `|P| = q^m`.\n2.  Let `K` be a Sylow `2`-subgroup of `G`. Its order is `|K| = 2`.\n3.  The number of Sylow `q`-subgroups, `n_q`, must divide `|G|/|P| = 2` and satisfy `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`.\n4.  Since `q` is an odd prime, `q \\ge 3`. The congruence `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q` means `n_q` could be `1, 1+q, 1+2q, ...`.\n5.  The only number that satisfies both `n_q | 2` (so `n_q \\in \\{1, 2\\}`) and `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q` (with `q \\ge 3`) is `n_q = 1`.\n6.  Since `n_q = 1`, the Sylow `q`-subgroup `P` is unique, and therefore **`P` is a normal subgroup of `G`**.\n7.  Since `P` is a normal subgroup, `G` is a **semidirect product** of `P` and `K`. We can write `G = P \\rtimes K`.\n8.  `G` is nonabelian, so the semidirect product cannot be a direct product. This means the homomorphism `\\phi: K \\to Aut(P)` that defines the action of `K` on `P` must be non-trivial. Since `K \\cong C_2` (the cyclic group of order 2), the image of the non-identity element of `K` must be an automorphism of `P` of order 2. Let this automorphism be `\\sigma`.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Characterization of Filled Groups**\n\nA crucial theorem from the study of filled groups provides a structural characterization:\n**Theorem:** A nonabelian finite group `G` is a filled group if and only if `G` has a **unique normal maximal subgroup**.\n\nWe will use this theorem to identify which of the groups `G = P \\rtimes K` are filled.\n\n**Step 4: Identify a Normal Maximal Subgroup**\n\nThe subgroup `P` is normal in `G`. Its index is `|G:P| = |G|/|P| = (2q^m) / q^m = 2`. Since the index is a prime number (2), there can be no proper subgroup `H` such that `P < H < G`. Therefore, **`P` is a maximal subgroup of `G`**.\n\nSo, we have established that `P` is a normal maximal subgroup of `G`. For `G` to be filled, `P` must be the *unique* such subgroup.\n\n**Step 5: Determine When Other Normal Maximal Subgroups Exist**\n\nLet `M` be a normal maximal subgroup of `G` such that `M \\neq P`.\n1.  Since `M` is a maximal subgroup, `G/M` must be a cyclic group of prime order, say `p`. So `|G| = |M| \\cdot p`.\n2.  `p` must be a prime divisor of `|G| = 2q^m`, so `p` can only be `2` or `q`.\n3.  If `p=2`, then `|M| = q^m`. Since `M` is a subgroup of order `q^m`, it must be a Sylow `q`-subgroup. As `P` is the unique Sylow `q`-subgroup, we must have `M=P`, which contradicts our assumption `M \\neq P`.\n4.  Therefore, if another normal maximal subgroup `M` exists, it must have `p=q`. This means its index is `|G:M| = q`, and its order is `|M| = 2q^{m-1}`.\n\nSo, `G` is filled if and only if `G` has **no normal subgroup of index q**.\n\n**Step 6: Relate Normal Subgroups of G to Subgroups of P**\n\nA normal subgroup `M` of `G` with index `q` would have to contain a Sylow 2-subgroup (by Sylow's theorems, since `|M|` is not divisible by `q` to a higher power than any other element of its conjugacy class, this reasoning is tricky, let's use a simpler argument). Let `M` be a normal subgroup of index `q`. Then `K=<k>` embeds into `G/M` of order `q`, impossible. Therefore `K` must be in the kernel of `G -> G/M`, i.e., `K \\le M`. So `M` must contain `K`.\n\nLet `M` be a normal subgroup of `G` of index `q`. `M` contains `K`. Let `Q = M \\cap P`. Then `M = QK`. Since `M` and `P` are normal, `Q = M \\cap P` is normal in `G`. Also, by the second isomorphism theorem, `G/M = (PK)/M \\cong P/(P \\cap M) = P/Q`.\nThus, `|P/Q| = q`, which means `Q` is a subgroup of `P` of index `q`. A subgroup of a `p`-group with index `p` is a maximal subgroup.\n\nSo, a normal subgroup `M` of index `q` exists in `G` if and only if there is a **maximal subgroup `Q` of `P` that is normal in `G`**.\nA subgroup `Q` of `P` is normal in `G = P \\rtimes K` if and only if it is invariant under the action of `K`. That is, `kQk^{-1} = Q`, or `\\sigma(Q)=Q` where `\\sigma` is the automorphism of order 2 defining the action.\n\nThe condition for `G` to be filled is now: **`P` has no `\\sigma`-invariant maximal subgroups.**\n\n**Step 7: Final Analysis Split by the value of m**\n\n*   **Case 1: m = 1**\n    In this case, `|P| = q`, so `P \\cong C_q`. `P` is a simple group. It has no proper non-trivial subgroups, and therefore **no maximal subgroups**. Since there are no maximal subgroups in `P`, there cannot be any `\\sigma`-invariant maximal subgroups.\n    Thus, `P` is the unique normal maximal subgroup. The group `G` is the nonabelian group of order `2q`, which is the **dihedral group `D_{2q}`**.\n    Conclusion: `D_{2q}` is a filled group.\n\n*   **Case 2: m > 1**\n    In this case, `P` is a `q`-group of order `q^m > q`, so it is not simple and has maximal subgroups. Let `d = d(P)` be the minimum number of generators for `P`. The number of maximal subgroups of `P` is given by the formula `(q^d - 1) / (q-1) = 1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^{d-1}`.\n    The automorphism `\\sigma` has order 2. It acts on the set of maximal subgroups of `P`. For `P` to have no `\\sigma`-invariant maximal subgroup, the action of `\\sigma` must have no fixed points.\n    If an element of order 2 acts on a set with no fixed points, it must partition the set into pairs. This implies that the size of the set must be an **even number**.\n    So, we need the number of maximal subgroups, `1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^{d-1}`, to be even.\n    Since `q` is an odd prime, `q^k` is odd for any `k \\ge 0`. The sum is a sum of `d` terms, all of which are odd.\n    - If `d` is odd, the sum of an odd number of odd terms is odd.\n    - If `d` is even, the sum of an even number of odd terms is even.\n    Therefore, for `G` to be filled when `m>1`, the minimum number of generators for its Sylow `q`-subgroup `P`, `d(P)`, must be **even**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The argument relies heavily on the Sylow theorems to establish the semidirect product structure `G = P \\rtimes K`.\n*   The key is using the known characterization of nonabelian filled groups as those with a unique normal maximal subgroup.\n*   The analysis must be split into two cases: `m=1` (where `P` is simple) and `m>1` (where `P` has maximal subgroups).\n*   For `m>1`, the connection between \"no `\\sigma`-invariant maximal subgroup in `P`\" and the number of generators `d(P)` being even is critical. It comes from a combinatorial argument about a permutation of order 2 having no fixed points.\n*   `d(P)` is the dimension of `P/Φ(P)` as a vector space over `F_q`, where `Φ(P)` is the Frattini subgroup of `P`.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups `G` of order `2q^m` are the semidirect products `G = P \\rtimes C_2`, where `P` is a `q`-group of order `q^m` and the action of `C_2` on `P` is non-trivial (via an automorphism `\\sigma` of `P` of order 2), satisfying one of the following conditions:\n\n1.  If `m=1`, `G` is the dihedral group `D_{2q}`.\n2.  If `m>1`, `G = P \\rtimes_\\sigma C_2` where `P` is any `q`-group of order `q^m` for which the minimum number of generators, `d(P)`, is an even number. The automorphism `\\sigma` must be of order 2 and chosen such that it has no fixed points on the set of maximal subgroups of `P` (a condition that can always be met if `d(P)` is even)."
