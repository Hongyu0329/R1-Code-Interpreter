The nonabelian filled groups `G` of order `2q^m` are the semidirect products `G = P \rtimes C_2`, where `P` is a `q`-group of order `q^m` and the action of `C_2` on `P` is non-trivial (via an automorphism `\sigma` of `P` of order 2), satisfying one of the following conditions:

1.  If `m=1`, `G` is the dihedral group `D_{2q}`.
2.  If `m>1`, `G = P \rtimes_\sigma C_2` where `P` is any `q`-group of order `q^m` for which the minimum number of generators, `d(P)`, is an even number. The automorphism `\sigma` must be of order 2 and chosen such that it has no fixed points on the set of maximal subgroups of `P` (a condition that can always be met if `d(P)` is even).
