    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Premise**\n\n*   The puzzle is presented as a haiku with a title.\n*   The title, \"The Bays\", is identified as the question.\n*   The haiku itself provides the clues to the answer.\n*   The final answer must be presented in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Question (The Title)**\n\n*   The title \"The Bays\" is not a question in its literal form. This points to a pun or wordplay.\n*   Phonetically, \"The Bays\" sounds identical to \"The Bs\".\n*   Therefore, the question being asked is: \"What are the Bs?\" The haiku must contain clues to identify a list of words that start with the letter 'B'.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Haiku Line by Line for \"B\" Words**\n\nThe goal is to find one \"B\" word that is clued by each of the three lines. The question asks \"what is the answer?\", implying the answer is a set of things (nouns).\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm.\n    *   A strong gale of wind is also known as a \"blow\". This is a noun that perfectly describes a tempest and starts with 'B'.\n    *   *Careful Point:* We are looking for a noun that represents the concept, not just any related word. \"Blow\" is an excellent candidate.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. This number seems designed to meet the seven-syllable requirement of the haiku's second line, rather than being a direct clue itself.\n    *   The core of the clue is \"winds of change\".\n    *   A gentle wind is called a \"breeze\". The phrase is often used metaphorically as a \"breeze of change\", which directly matches the clue. \"Breeze\" is a noun that fits perfectly.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The word \"brings\" is literally in the line, but riddles often require interpretation rather than just picking a word out. \"Breeze\" is a more satisfying and clever answer for \"winds of change\".\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This line refers to something a deity or holy figure produces or delivers.\n    *   A classic example is Jesus (\"a divine one\") delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which \"yields\" a series of blessings.\n    *   These specific blessings are known as the \"Beatitudes\". The singular form is \"Beatitude\", which is a noun meaning supreme blessedness. This is a very elegant and fitting 'B' word for the clue.\n    *   *Careful Point:* While a simpler word like \"Blessing\" also fits, \"Beatitude\" is more specific to something that is \"yielded\" (spoken/delivered) and carries a poetic weight that matches the tone of the haiku.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize and Format the Final Answer**\n\n*   We have identified three nouns starting with 'B' from the haiku: **Blow, Breeze, Beatitude**.\n*   The instructions require the answer to be in alphabetical order.\n*   Arranging these words alphabetically gives: Beatitude, Blow, Breeze.\n\n<<<Beatitude, Blow, Breeze>>>"
