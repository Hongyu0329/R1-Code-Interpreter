    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of edge squares on a chessboard.**\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has four edges:\n*   The top row (rank 8) has 8 squares.\n*   The bottom row (rank 1) has 8 squares.\n*   The left column (file 'a') has 8 squares.\n*   The right column (file 'h') has 8 squares.\nTo find the total number of unique edge squares, we must avoid double-counting the four corner squares (a1, h1, a8, h8).\nTotal edge squares = (Squares in rank 1 + Squares in rank 8) + (Squares in file 'a' + Squares in file 'h') - 4 corners\nTotal edge squares = (8 + 8) + (8 + 8) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28.\nAlternatively, we can count it as 8 squares on the top row, 8 on the bottom row, and 6 squares each on the left and right sides (excluding the already-counted corners). So, 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly count the total number of squares we are working with. A common mistake is to simply add 8+8+8+8=32, forgetting that the corner squares are part of two edges.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the placement constraints for bishops.**\nBishops attack along diagonals. A key rule is that a bishop placed on a white square can only attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other pieces on black squares. This allows us to consider the placement on white squares and black squares as two separate, independent problems.\n\n**Careful Point:** Realizing that the problem can be split by color simplifies the analysis significantly.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the placement of bishops on the white edge squares.**\nFirst, let's count the number of white edge squares. The edges have an equal number of white and black squares.\nTotal edge squares = 28\nNumber of white edge squares = 28 / 2 = 14.\nNumber of black edge squares = 28 / 2 = 14.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares. A bishop on an edge square can only attack at most one other edge square along a diagonal. We can identify these pairs:\n*   a2 attacks g8\n*   a4 attacks e8\n*   a6 attacks c8\n*   a8 attacks h1\n*   b1 attacks h7\n*   d1 attacks h5\n*   f1 attacks h3\nWe have identified 7 pairs of white edge squares that attack each other. To place the maximum number of bishops, we can place exactly one bishop from each pair.\nTherefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the white edge squares is 7.\n\n**Careful Point:** The core insight here is that the white edge squares can be grouped into 7 mutually exclusive pairs based on diagonal attacks.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the placement of bishops on the black edge squares.**\nThe situation for black squares is perfectly symmetrical to the white squares. There are 14 black edge squares. We can again form 7 pairs of squares that attack each other diagonally:\n*   a1 attacks h8\n*   a3 attacks f8\n*   a5 attacks d8\n*   a7 attacks b8\n*   c1 attacks h6\n*   e1 attacks h4\n*   g1 attacks h2\nFrom each of these 7 pairs, we can only place one bishop.\nTherefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the black edge squares is also 7.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of bishops and the number of empty squares.**\n*   Maximum bishops on white squares = 7\n*   Maximum bishops on black squares = 7\n*   Total maximum bishops that can be placed on all edge squares = 7 + 7 = 14.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28\n*   Total number of placed bishops = 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Total placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of the chessboard, 14 edge squares will be occupied by bishops, and the remaining squares will be empty.\n\nNumber of empty edge squares = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
