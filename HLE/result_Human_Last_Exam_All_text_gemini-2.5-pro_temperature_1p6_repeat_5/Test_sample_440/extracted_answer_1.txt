The density profile `\(\rho(z)\)` is given by the expression `\(\rho(z) = m_A n_A(z) + m_B n_B(z)\)`. The number density profiles `\(n_A(z)\)` and `\(n_B(z)\)` are the solutions to the system of two coupled equations derived from the principle of constant total chemical potential (`\(\mu_i^{chem} + m_i g z = \text{const}\)`) for each species `\(i\)` in a van der Waals mixture. The explicit equations are:
1. `\( k_B T \ln\left(\frac{n_A(z)}{1 - n_A(z)b'_{AA} - n_B(z)b'_{BB}}\right) + \frac{k_B T b'_{AA} (n_A(z) + n_B(z))}{1 - n_A(z)b'_{AA} - n_B(z)b'_{BB}} - 2(n_A(z)a'_{AA} + n_B(z)a'_{AB}) + m_A g z = C_1 \)`
2. `\( k_B T \ln\left(\frac{n_B(z)}{1 - n_A(z)b'_{AA} - n_B(z)b'_{BB}}\right) + \frac{k_B T b'_{BB} (n_A(z) + n_B(z))}{1 - n_A(z)b'_{AA} - n_B(z)b'_{BB}} - 2(n_A(z)a'_{AB} + n_B(z)a'_{BB}) + m_B g z = C_2 \)`
These equations, subject to the integral constraints `\(N_A = A \int_0^H n_A(z) dz\)` and `\(N_B = A \int_0^H n_B(z) dz\)`, implicitly define the density profiles. An analytical solution is not feasible.
