    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the spaces and their connectivity\n\nFirst, let's identify the source and target spaces and determine their connectivity.\n\n*   **Source Space:** $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected. This is because $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(S^n)$, and $\\pi_{k+1}(S^n)=0$ for $k+1 < n$, which means $k < n-1$. The first non-vanishing homotopy group is for $k=n-1$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   And $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product of a $p$-connected space and a $q$-connected space is $(p+q+1)$-connected.\n    *   So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of the suspension $\\Sigma X$ is one greater than the connectivity of $X$.\n    *   Therefore, the source space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n*   **Target Space:** $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   The smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to $S^{4+6} = S^{10}$.\n    *   So, the target space is $B = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   The space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected. Oh wait, it is $(10-1)$-connected. The first non-zero homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10})=\\pi_{10}(S^{10})=\\mathbb{Z}$. The connectivity is $10-1 = 9$.\n    *   So, the target space $B = \\Omega S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n\nWe are considering a map $\\phi: A \\to B$ from an 8-connected space to a 9-connected space.\n\n### Step 2: Propose a construction for the map\n\nThe phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" hints at a natural construction involving canonical maps in homotopy theory. A likely candidate for $\\phi$ is the composition of two standard maps arising from the suspension-loop space adjunction ($\\Sigma \\dashv \\Omega$).\n\nLet's define the map $\\phi$ as the following composition:\n$\\phi: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} \\Omega\\Sigma(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\xrightarrow{\\Omega(ev_4 \\wedge ev_6)} \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the maps involved:\n1.  **The map $\\alpha$**: This is the unit of the adjunction, $\\alpha: X \\to \\Omega\\Sigma X$. In our case, $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, so the target space of $\\alpha$ is $\\Omega\\Sigma(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) = \\Omega\\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n2.  **The map $ev_n$**: This is the evaluation map $ev_n: \\Sigma \\Omega S^n \\to S^n$, which is the counit of the adjunction.\n3.  **The map $ev_4 \\wedge ev_6$**: This is the smash product of the two evaluation maps:\n    $ev_4 \\wedge ev_6: (\\Sigma \\Omega S^4) \\wedge (\\Sigma \\Omega S^6) \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n    The domain simplifies to $\\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, and the codomain is $S^{10}$.\n4.  **The map $\\Omega(ev_4 \\wedge ev_6)$**: This is the looping of the smash product map, which maps $\\Omega\\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ to $\\Omega(S^{10})$.\n\nThis provides a well-defined map from our source space $A$ to our target space $B$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the connectivity of the constituent maps\n\nThe connectivity of a composition of maps $g \\circ f$ is at least $\\min(\\text{conn}(f), \\text{conn}(g))$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of $\\alpha$**:\n    The map $\\alpha: X \\to \\Omega\\Sigma X$ is the adjoint of the identity map on $\\Sigma X$. Its connectivity is given by the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem. The suspension map $E: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_{i+1}(\\Sigma X)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(X) + 1$. The map on homotopy induced by $\\alpha$ is essentially this suspension map.\n    Our space $X = A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is 8-connected.\n    Thus, $\\alpha$ is an isomorphism on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < 2(8) + 1 = 17$.\n    So, the connectivity of $\\alpha$ is 17.\n\n*   **Connectivity of $\\Omega(ev_4 \\wedge ev_6)$**:\n    The connectivity of a looped map $\\Omega f$ is the same as the connectivity of $f$. So we need to find the connectivity of $ev_4 \\wedge ev_6$.\n    We use two standard results:\n    1.  The connectivity of the evaluation map $ev_n: \\Sigma\\Omega S^n \\to S^n$ is $2n-3$.\n        *   For $n=4$, $conn(ev_4) = 2(4) - 3 = 5$.\n        *   For $n=6$, $conn(ev_6) = 2(6) - 3 = 9$.\n    2.  For maps between suspensions, $f_1: \\Sigma A_1 \\to \\Sigma B_1$ and $f_2: \\Sigma A_2 \\to \\Sigma B_2$, where $A_i, B_i$ are path-connected, the connectivity of their smash product $f_1 \\wedge f_2$ is given by the formula:\n        $\\text{conn}(f_1 \\wedge f_2) = \\text{conn}(f_1) + \\text{conn}(f_2) + 1$.\n        Our maps fit this pattern:\n        *   $ev_4: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4) \\to S^4 = \\Sigma S^3$. The spaces $\\Omega S^4$ and $S^3$ are path-connected.\n        *   $ev_6: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^6) \\to S^6 = \\Sigma S^5$. The spaces $\\Omega S^6$ and $S^5$ are path-connected.\n        Applying the formula, we get:\n        $\\text{conn}(ev_4 \\wedge ev_6) = 5 + 9 + 1 = 15$.\n    Therefore, the connectivity of $\\Omega(ev_4 \\wedge ev_6)$ is also 15.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe connectivity of the composite map $\\phi = \\Omega(ev_4 \\wedge ev_6) \\circ \\alpha$ is the minimum of the connectivities of its parts.\n$\\text{conn}(\\phi) = \\min(\\text{conn}(\\alpha), \\text{conn}(\\Omega(ev_4 \\wedge ev_6)))$\n$\\text{conn}(\\phi) = \\min(17, 15) = 15$.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 15.\n\n>>>15"
