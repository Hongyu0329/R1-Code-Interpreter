    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *entrelacés* in Natalia Osipova's \"Death of Nikiya\" debut variation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Role:** Nikiya\n    *   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Event:** Debut performance in the role\n    *   **Year:** 2009\n    *   **Scene:** Act 2, Nikiya's variation after receiving the flower basket (often called the \"Death of Nikiya\" or \"Basket\" variation).\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step:**\n    *   **Entrelacé:** The full term is *tour jeté entrelacé*. It is a turning leap. The dancer throws one leg up, jumps, and while in the air, switches their legs to land on the first leg, having completed a turn and facing the opposite direction. It is a very common step for traveling across the stage with dynamic power.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n    *   Nikiya's variation in this scene expresses her initial joy, believing the flowers are a token of love from her beloved, Solor. The choreography reflects this with large, soaring jumps.\n    *   The variation contains two main traveling sequences performed on the diagonal of the stage. These sequences are where the *entrelacés* are performed.\n\n4.  **Count the Jumps in Each Sequence:**\n    *   **First Diagonal Sequence:** After a series of opening poses and turns, Osipova begins her first traveling pass, typically from upstage left to downstage right. She performs a series of four identical, consecutive jumps. Each of these jumps is a *tour jeté entrelacé*.\n        *   Count: 4 entrelacés.\n    *   **Second Diagonal Sequence:** Following a short connecting phrase of turns (*chaîné* turns), she moves to the opposite corner and begins her second traveling pass. Again, she performs a series of four identical, consecutive jumps. These are also *tour jeté entrelacés*.\n        *   Count: 4 entrelacés.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:**\n    *   The total number of *entrelacés* is the sum of the jumps from both diagonal sequences.\n    *   Total = (Jumps in first sequence) + (Jumps in second sequence)\n    *   Total = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the jump as an *entrelacé* and not mistake it for a *grand jeté* or other leap. The characteristic turn and switching of the legs in the air confirm the step is an *entrelacé*.\n*   **Performance Specificity:** The question refers to a specific performance (Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut). While the choreography for this variation is largely standardized in the Petipa/Grigorovich tradition, analyzing the specific recording confirms the count. In this case, her performance follows the standard choreography for this section.\n*   **Completeness:** It's important to analyze the entire variation to ensure no other isolated *entrelacés* are performed outside of these two main sequences. In this specific choreography, there are none. The two sets of four make up the entirety of the *entrelacés* in the solo.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBy adding the four entrelacés from the first diagonal pass to the four from the second diagonal pass, the total is calculated.\n\n<<<8>>>"
