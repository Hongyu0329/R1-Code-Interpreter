    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who satisfies four criteria:\n    a.  They must be a Christian theologian.\n    b.  They must have developed **specialized terminology**. This is a key constraint, meaning we are looking for specific, defined terms, not just general ideas.\n    c.  This terminology must be able to describe **changes in the laws of nature**.\n    d.  This framework must be applicable to two specific examples: the **virgin birth of Jesus** and potential **alterations in natural law at the Fall**.\n\n2.  **Initial Theological Survey & Elimination:**\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas:** A major figure who wrote on miracles and natural law. He differentiated between primary (God) and secondary (natural) causes. For Aquinas, a miracle is when God acts outside the order of secondary causes. While he distinguished acts as *supra naturam* (above nature), *praeter naturam* (beside nature), and *contra naturam* (against nature), his framework is more about God *bypassing* or *overriding* the laws, rather than a terminology for the laws *themselves changing* from an embedded potential.\n    *   **John Calvin:** Focused on God's absolute sovereignty and providence. Miracles are direct expressions of God's will. His key term, \"accommodation,\" refers to God adapting His revelation to human understanding, not to a change in physical laws.\n    *   **Modern Theologians (e.g., C.S. Lewis, Alvin Plantinga):** While they have written extensively on this topic, the question implies finding the originator or a foundational figure who *first* developed such terminology. These later figures are building on an established tradition.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the Most Likely Candidate: Augustine of Hippo**\n    *   **Criterion (a) Christian Theologian:** Augustine (354-430 AD) is one of the most influential theologians in Western Christianity.\n    *   **Criterion (b) Specialized Terminology:** Augustine developed the key concept of ***rationes seminales***, a Latin term that can be translated as \"seminal reasons,\" \"causal principles,\" or \"seed-like principles.\"\n    *   **Criterion (c) Describing Changes in Laws of Nature:** The theory of *rationes seminales* posits that God, in the original act of creation, embedded latent potentials or causal principles for all things that would ever come into being. The everyday, observable \"laws of nature\" represent the normal unfolding of some of these principles. However, other principles remain dormant until God wills them to become active. A miracle, therefore, is not God changing His mind or violating the nature He created. Instead, it is the activation of a pre-ordained potential that lies outside the *usual course* of nature. This provides a vocabulary to describe a \"change\" not as a breaking of law, but as the emergence of a different, pre-programmed natural order.\n    *   **Criterion (d) Applicability to Key Examples:**\n        *   **Virgin Birth:** According to Augustine's framework, the virgin birth was not *contra naturam* (against nature), because God is the author of nature. Rather, it was *praeter cursum naturae* (beyond the usual course of nature). God had embedded the *ratio seminalis* for a human to be conceived without a male seed in the fabric of creation from the very beginning. The Incarnation was the moment God chose to activate this unique potential.\n        *   **The Fall:** The changes to the world after the Fall (e.g., the ground producing thorns and thistles, the introduction of decay and the inevitability of death for humans) can be explained using the same logic. These were not arbitrary punishments but the activation of other latent causal principles in nature, contingent upon human sin. Before the Fall, humanity existed in a state where it was *posse non mori* (able not to die). After the Fall, the \"law\" governing human existence changed, and humanity became *non posse non mori* (not able not to die). This change was an outcome of dormant principles being brought into effect by the event of the Fall.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Originality:** Augustine adapted this idea from Stoic philosophy (the Greek *logoi spermatikoi*), but he Christianized it and was the first to integrate it systematically into Christian theology to explain creation, providence, and miracles.\n*   **Terminology is Key:** The specificity of the term *rationes seminales* is what makes Augustine the correct answer. It's a precise philosophical and theological term designed specifically for this purpose.\n*   **Distinction:** It's crucial to distinguish Augustine's view from Deism (where God sets the world in motion and leaves it alone) and Occasionalism (where God is the direct cause of every single event, and there are no real natural laws). Augustine's view preserves both God's continuous providential action and the reality of a stable, ordered natural world with its own causal regularities.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specialized terminological framework, centered on the concept of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons), to explain how events that appear to alter the laws of nature, such as the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall, are possible within God's created and providential order.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
