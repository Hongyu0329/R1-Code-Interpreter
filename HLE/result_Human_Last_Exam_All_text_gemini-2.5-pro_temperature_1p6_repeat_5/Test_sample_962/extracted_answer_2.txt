The proposed design is a t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme based on the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature primitive. The design consists of three protocols: a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol, a two-round signing protocol, and a public verification algorithm.

**1. System Parameters:**
- Groups `G₁`, `G₂`, `G_T` of prime order `p` with a generator `g` of `G₁` and a bilinear map `e: G₁ × G₂ → G_T`.
- A hash function `H: {0,1}* → G₂` modeled as a random oracle.

**2. Distributed Key Generation (DKG):**
A robust Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme (e.g., Feldman's or Pedersen's) is used by the `n` parties to jointly create a master secret key `x` without a trusted dealer.
- **Output:** A master public key `PK = g^x` known to all. Each party `P_i` obtains a secret share `sk_i` of `x` and a public verification key `pk_i = g^{sk_i}`.

**3. Two-Round Signing Protocol (for `t` parties in set `S`):**
- **Round 1 (Commitment):** A coordinator announces the message `m` and the signing set `S`. Each participant `P_i ∈ S` confirms they are online and willing to sign by broadcasting an "ack" message. This establishes the active `t`-sized signer set.
- **Round 2 (Partial Signature Generation):**
    1. Each participant `P_i ∈ S` computes its partial signature `σ_i = H(m)^{sk_i}`.
    2. Each participant broadcasts `σ_i`.
    3. **Crucially, all parties (or an aggregator) must verify each received partial signature `σ_j` by checking if `e(g, σ_j) == e(pk_j, H(m))`. This prevents attacks from malicious participants.**

- **Signature Aggregation (Local Computation):**
    1. An aggregator collects `t` valid partial signatures.
    2. The aggregator computes the Lagrange coefficient `λ_i` for each signer `i ∈ S`.
    3. The final signature is computed as `σ = Π_{i∈S} (σ_i)^{λ_i}`.

**4. Verification:**
Anyone can verify the signature `σ` on message `m` against the public key `PK` by checking if `e(PK, H(m)) == e(g, σ)`.

**Why this design meets the requirements:**
- **t-out-of-n:** Guaranteed by the use of `(t-1)`-degree polynomial secret sharing.
- **Two Rounds:** The signing protocol has two explicit communication rounds.
- **Tightly Secure:** The scheme's security is based on the BLS signature construction by Boldyreva, which has a tight security reduction to the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem in the rando
