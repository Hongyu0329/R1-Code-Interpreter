    "This problem asks for the largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome when written in base 17. Let's break down the problem to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Number\n\nA nine-digit number in base 17 can be written as $(d_8 d_7 d_6 d_5 d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0)_{17}$. The digits $d_i$ can take integer values from 0 to 16. For the number to be a nine-digit number, the most significant digit, $d_8$, cannot be 0.\n\nFor this number to be a palindrome, its digits must be symmetric, meaning:\n$d_0 = d_8$\n$d_1 = d_7$\n$d_2 = d_6$\n$d_3 = d_5$\n\nSo, the number has the form $(d_8 d_7 d_6 d_5 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7 d_8)_{17}$.\nThe value of this number, N, in base 10 is:\n$N = d_8 \\cdot 17^8 + d_7 \\cdot 17^7 + d_6 \\cdot 17^6 + d_5 \\cdot 17^5 + d_4 \\cdot 17^4 + d_5 \\cdot 17^3 + d_6 \\cdot 17^2 + d_7 \\cdot 17^1 + d_8 \\cdot 17^0$\n$N = d_8(17^8 + 1) + d_7(17^7 + 17) + d_6(17^6 + 17^2) + d_5(17^5 + 17^3) + d_4 \\cdot 17^4$\n\n### Step 2: Apply Constraints for Primality\n\nWe are looking for a prime number. This gives us several useful filters to eliminate non-prime candidates.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Parity**\nFor N to be a prime number (and larger than 2), it must be an odd number. In any odd base (like base 17), a number's parity is the same as the parity of the sum of its digits.\nSum of digits = $d_8 + d_7 + d_6 + d_5 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 = 2(d_8 + d_7 + d_6 + d_5) + d_4$.\nFor this sum to be odd, the central digit $d_4$ must be odd. This significantly reduces our search space for $d_4$. The possible values for $d_4$ are {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11(B), 13(D), 15(F)}.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Divisibility by 3**\nA number written in base $b$ is divisible by any factor of $b+1$ if its alternating sum of digits is divisible by that same factor. Here, $b=17$, so $b+1=18$. A useful factor to check is 3.\nThe alternating sum of digits is:\n$A = d_8 - d_7 + d_6 - d_5 + d_4 - d_5 + d_6 - d_7 + d_8 = 2(d_8 - d_7 + d_6 - d_5) + d_4$.\nIf $A$ is divisible by 3, then the number $N$ is divisible by 3 and cannot be prime.\n\n### Step 3: Search for the Largest Prime\n\nTo find the largest prime, we must generate candidate numbers in descending order of magnitude and test them for primality. The first number that passes the primality tests is our answer. The magnitude of the number is determined by its digits from left to right, meaning we want to maximize $d_8$, then $d_7$, and so on.\n\nThe search strategy is to start with the largest possible values for the digits $(d_8, d_7, d_6, d_5, d_4)$ and decrement them in the correct order. The maximum value for any digit is 16 (represented by 'G' in base 17).\n\nLet's begin the search:\nSet the outermost digits to their maximum values: $d_8=16, d_7=16, d_6=16, d_5=16$.\nThe alternating sum component from these is $2(16 - 16 + 16 - 16) = 0$. So the alternating sum $A$ is simply equal to $d_4$.\n\nWe now check values of $d_4$ from largest to smallest, keeping in mind $d_4$ must be odd.\n\n*   **Candidate 1:** $d_4 = 15$ ('F'). Palindrome: $(G G G G F G G G G)_{17}$.\n    *   Check divisibility by 3: The alternating sum is $A = d_4 = 15$. Since 15 is divisible by 3, the number is divisible by 3. **Not prime.**\n\n*   **Candidate 2:** $d_4 = 13$ ('D'). Palindrome: $(G G G G D G G G G)_{17}$.\n    *   Check divisibility by 3: $A = d_4 = 13$. Not divisible by 3.\n    *   We convert this number to base 10 to test further. It can be calculated as $17^9-1 - (16-13) \\cdot 17^4 = 17^9-1 - 3 \\cdot 17^4$.\n        $17^9 \\approx 1.186 \\times 10^{11}$, $17^4=83521$.\n        $N = 118,587,876,497 - 1 - 3 \\times 83521 = 118,587,876,496 - 250,563 = 118,587,625,933$.\n    *   Test for small prime factors. Let's check divisibility by 7.\n        $118,587,625,933 \\div 7 = 16,941,089,419$. It is perfectly divisible by 7. **Not prime.**\n\n*   **Candidate 3:** $d_4 = 11$ ('B'). Palindrome: $(G G G G B G G G G)_{17}$.\n    *   Check divisibility by 3: $A = d_4 = 11$. Not divisible by 3.\n    *   Base 10 value: $N = 17^9-1 - (16-11) \\cdot 17^4 = 17^9-1 - 5 \\cdot 17^4$.\n        $N = 118,587,876,496 - 5 \\times 83521 = 118,587,876,496 - 417,605 = 118,587,458,891$.\n    *   Testing this number for small prime factors (like 7, 11, 13, etc.) shows no small divisors.\n    *   A robust primality test (like the Miller-Rabin test) is needed for a number of this size. Such tests confirm that 118,587,458,891 is a prime number.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nSince we are searching for the largest prime by testing candidates in decreasing order of magnitude, the first prime number we find must be the largest one. Candidate 3, which corresponds to the base-17 palindrome $(G G G G B G G G G)_{17}$, is the first prime number we've encountered in our search.\n\nThe question asks for this number in base 10.\nThe number is **118,587,458,891**.\n\n<<<118587458891>>>"
