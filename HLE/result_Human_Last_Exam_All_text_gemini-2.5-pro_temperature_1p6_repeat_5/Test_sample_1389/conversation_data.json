    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the key terms:**\n    *   **All-or-nothing vaccine:** This is a type of vaccine that confers perfect immunity to a certain proportion of the vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection at all to the remaining proportion. Let's say a proportion `p` are fully protected (their susceptibility becomes 0), and the remaining proportion `1-p` are not protected at all (their susceptibility remains the same as an unvaccinated person).\n    *   **Per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_PE):** This measures the reduction in the probability of infection *given a single exposure* to the pathogen. It is defined as:\n        VE_PE = 1 - (Risk of infection per exposure in a vaccinated person) / (Risk of infection per exposure in an unvaccinated person). This is fundamentally a measure of the reduction in biological susceptibility.\n    *   **Incidence rate ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`I_v`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`I_u`).\n        IRR = `I_v / I_u`.\n    *   **1 - incidence rate ratio (1 - IRR):** This is a common formula used to calculate vaccine effectiveness from clinical trial data. It represents the proportional reduction in the incidence rate observed in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group.\n\n2.  **Relate the terms mathematically.**\n    *   Our goal is to compare `VE_PE` with `1 - IRR` for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Assumption of Equal Exposure:** A critical assumption when comparing incidence rates is that both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups have the same behavior and thus the same rate of exposure to the pathogen. In a randomized controlled trial, this assumption is generally considered valid.\n*   **Defining Susceptibility:** Let `S_u` be the susceptibility of an unvaccinated person. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, a proportion `p` of vaccinated individuals have susceptibility `0`, and a proportion `1-p` have susceptibility `S_u`.\n*   **Incidence Rate Formula:** The incidence rate in a population is proportional to the force of infection (the rate of exposure to the pathogen) and the average susceptibility of that population.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_PE)**\n\n*   The risk of infection per exposure is proportional to susceptibility.\n*   Risk per exposure in an unvaccinated person is proportional to `S_u`.\n*   In the vaccinated group, we must consider the *average* susceptibility (`S_v_avg`).\n    *   `S_v_avg` = (proportion protected * susceptibility of protected) + (proportion not protected * susceptibility of not protected)\n    *   `S_v_avg` = (`p` * 0) + (`1-p` * `S_u`) = `(1-p) * S_u`\n*   Now, we can calculate `VE_PE` using its definition:\n    *   `VE_PE` = 1 - (Average susceptibility in vaccinated) / (Susceptibility in unvaccinated)\n    *   `VE_PE` = 1 - (`S_v_avg` / `S_u`)\n    *   `VE_PE` = 1 - (`(1-p) * S_u` / `S_u`)\n    *   `VE_PE` = 1 - (1-p) = `p`\n*   So, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the per-exposure efficacy is exactly equal to `p`, the proportion of individuals who are fully protected.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the value of `1 - IRR`**\n\n*   The incidence rate (`I`) is the product of the force of infection (`λ`) and the average susceptibility (`S`).\n*   Incidence rate in the unvaccinated group: `I_u` = `λ` * `S_u`.\n*   Incidence rate in the vaccinated group: `I_v` = `λ` * `S_v_avg`. We use the average susceptibility because the population is a mix of protected and unprotected individuals.\n*   Substitute the value of `S_v_avg` from Step 1: `I_v` = `λ` * (`(1-p) * S_u`).\n*   Now, calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):\n    *   IRR = `I_v` / `I_u`\n    *   IRR = (`λ` * (`(1-p) * S_u`)) / (`λ` * `S_u`)\n    *   The `λ` and `S_u` terms cancel out.\n    *   IRR = `1-p`\n*   Finally, calculate the measure `1 - IRR`:\n    *   `1 - IRR` = 1 - (`1-p`) = `p`\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Results**\n\n*   From Step 1, we found that `VE_PE = p`.\n*   From Step 2, we found that `1 - IRR = p`.\n*   Therefore, `VE_PE = 1 - IRR`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor an all-or-nothing vaccine, under the standard assumption of equal exposure between groups, the measure `1 - IRR` is mathematically identical to the per-exposure vaccine efficacy. Thus, it **correctly estimates** the per-exposure efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
