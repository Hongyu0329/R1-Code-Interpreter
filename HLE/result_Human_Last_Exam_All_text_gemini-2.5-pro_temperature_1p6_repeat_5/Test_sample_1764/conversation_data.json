    "An analysis of the question step by step.\n\n**1. Understand the components of the question:**\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** This is a set $X$ with a finite number of points, equipped with a distance function $d(x,y)$ that satisfies the standard metric axioms plus the strong triangle inequality (or ultrametric inequality): $d(x,z) \\le \\max(d(x,y), d(y,z))$ for all $x,y,z \\in X$.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** This is a complete normed vector space. The norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$ induces a metric $d_B(u,v) = \\|u-v\\|$. Standard examples are $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with any norm, or spaces of functions like $C[0,1]$. A Banach space must be defined over the field $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   **Cardinality K:** The Banach space $B$ has $K$ elements. If $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, its cardinality $K$ is at least that of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding if it preserves distances. That is, for every pair of points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the distance between their images in $B$ is equal to their original distance in $X$: $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n*   **The Goal:** The question asks for the \"smallest possible number\" of such isometric embeddings. This means we should consider all possible pairs of $(X, B)$ that fit the description (where $X$ is any finite ultrametric space and $B$ is any Banach space) and find the minimum number of embeddings that can occur, assuming at least one embedding exists.\n\n**2. Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze a general, non-trivial case.**\n    Let's assume we have a finite ultrametric space $X$ with at least two points (so not all distances are zero), and a non-trivial Banach space $B$ (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$). Let's also assume that at least one isometric embedding $f_0: X \\to B$ exists. (Such embeddings are known to exist, for example, into $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the max-norm, which is a non-trivial Banach space).\n\n*   **Step 2: Use isometries of the Banach space to generate more embeddings.**\n    The group of isometries of a Banach space $B$ includes translations. For any vector $b \\in B$, the translation map $T_b: B \\to B$ defined by $T_b(v) = v + b$ is an isometry of $B$. This is because for any $u, v \\in B$, the distance is preserved: $\\|T_b(u) - T_b(v)\\| = \\|(u+b) - (v+b)\\| = \\|u-v\\|$.\n    If $f_0: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding, then composing it with an isometry of $B$ will yield a new isometric embedding. Let's define a new function $f_b: X \\to B$ by $f_b(x) = f_0(x) + b$.\n    Let's check if $f_b$ is an isometric embedding:\n    $\\|f_b(x_1) - f_b(x_2)\\| = \\|(f_0(x_1) + b) - (f_0(x_2) + b)\\| = \\|f_0(x_1) - f_0(x_2)\\| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n    The condition is satisfied. So, for every vector $b \\in B$, we get a new isometric embedding $f_b$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Count the number of generated embeddings.**\n    The functions $f_b$ are all distinct. If $b_1 \\neq b_2$, then $f_{b_1}$ and $f_{b_2}$ are different functions, because for any $x \\in X$, $f_{b_1}(x) = f_0(x) + b_1 \\neq f_0(x) + b_2 = f_{b_2}(x)$.\n    This means there are at least as many isometric embeddings as there are elements in $B$. The number of embeddings is at least $|B| = K$.\n    Since we assumed $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, its cardinality $K$ is infinite (at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$). So, in any non-trivial case, the number of embeddings is infinite.\n\n*   **Step 4: Search for a minimal case.**\n    The analysis above suggests that to find a finite number of embeddings, we must look at \"trivial\" cases which were excluded in the reasoning above. The question asks for the smallest possible number, so we must consider all valid choices for $X$ and $B$.\n    The potential \"loopholes\" in the argument for an infinite number of embeddings are:\n    1.  What if the Banach space $B$ is trivial?\n    2.  What if the finite ultrametric space $X$ is trivial?\n\n*   **Step 5: Analyze the trivial Banach space case.**\n    Let's consider the trivial Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   Is it a vector space? Yes, the zero vector space.\n    *   Is it normed? Yes, with $\\|0\\|=0$.\n    *   Is it complete? Yes, any Cauchy sequence must be constant (0, 0, ...) and converges to 0.\n    So, $B=\\{0\\}$ is a valid Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n\n*   **Step 6: Analyze embedding into the trivial Banach space.**\n    Let's try to embed a finite ultrametric space $X$ into $B=\\{0\\}$.\n    An embedding would be a function $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$, which means $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in X$.\n    The isometry condition is $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n    Substituting our function and space, this becomes $\\|0-0\\| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$, which simplifies to $0 = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n    This equation must hold for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$. This implies that the distance between any two points in $X$ must be zero. By the metric axioms, this is only possible if $X$ contains a single point.\n    So, an embedding into $B=\\{0\\}$ is only possible if $X$ is a one-point space.\n\n*   **Step 7: Find a specific case yielding the minimum number.**\n    Let's combine these findings.\n    *   Choose the simplest possible finite ultrametric space: $X = \\{x_0\\}$, a space with a single point. The only distance is $d(x_0, x_0)=0$. This satisfies the ultrametric axioms trivially.\n    *   Choose the simplest possible Banach space: $B = \\{0\\}$, with cardinality $K=1$.\n    Now, let's count the number of isometric embeddings from this $X$ to this $B$.\n    *   A function $f: \\{x_0\\} \\to \\{0\\}$ must map $x_0$ to $0$. There is only one such function.\n    *   We must check if this single function is an isometric embedding. The condition is $\\|f(x_0)-f(x_0)\\| = d(x_0,x_0)$, which is $\\|0-0\\| = 0$. This is true.\n    *   Therefore, for this specific choice of $X$ and $B$, there exists exactly one isometric embedding.\n\n*   **Step 8: Final Conclusion.**\n    We have found a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 1. Since the number of embeddings must be a positive integer (assuming embeddings exist), the smallest possible number cannot be less than 1.\n    Thus, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The set of all possible numbers of embeddings (for which embeddings exist) is a set of cardinal numbers. We have shown that this set contains 1 (for the trivial case) and various infinite cardinals (for non-trivial cases). The minimum element of this set is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
