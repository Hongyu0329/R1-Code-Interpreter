    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and context.**\nThe question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the UK during World War II. The other party involved is British counterintelligence (specifically MI5). The central issue is that Vernault was wrongly suspected of being a German spy.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reason for the suspicion.**\nThe text explicitly states that the suspicion arose because he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\" In the high-stakes environment of wartime counterintelligence, any form of deception, evasion, or concealment from a subject under interrogation is a major red flag. Interrogators are trained to look for such behavior as a potential sign of a trained agent protecting their cover story.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the core of the problem.**\nThe problem is a misunderstanding. Vernault's reason for concealment was not related to espionage. Instead, it stemmed from a personal, non-criminal motivation. We need to find what this profession was and why he would feel the need to hide it.\n\n**Step 4: Research the historical case of Andre Vernault.**\nHistorical records from MI5 and accounts from intelligence historians (like those by Ben Macintyre) document this case. Andre Vernault arrived in Britain in 1941. During his debriefing and interrogation by MI5 officers, he was evasive when asked about his past employment. This secrecy immediately put him under suspicion as a potential plant by the German intelligence service, the Abwehr.\n\n**Step 5: Uncover the true profession and the motivation for secrecy.**\nFurther investigation by MI5 eventually revealed the truth. Vernault's profession was not something illegal or treasonous, but something he personally found embarrassing, especially when talking to military and intelligence officers. He was a professional **embalmer and cosmetician for the dead**. He feared that revealing this would subject him to ridicule and disgust, and that the interrogators would not take him seriously. His fear of social stigma, not his allegiance to a foreign power, was the reason for his secrecy. The case became a classic lesson within MI5 about how an individual's personal secrets can mimic the signs of espionage.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the final answer.**\nBased on the historical facts, Andre Vernault's true profession was that of an embalmer.\n\n***\n\nHe was an embalmer."
