    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hurwitz number.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the problem and relevant concepts**\n\nThe problem asks for a Hurwitz number, which counts the number of ramified covers between two Riemann spheres, $f: \\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$, with specific properties.\n\n*   **Degree of the cover (d):** The degree is $d=7$. This means that for a generic point in the target $\\mathbb{P}^1$, its preimage under $f$ consists of 7 points.\n*   **Branch points and ramification profiles ($\\mu_i$):** There are $k=4$ branch points. The ramification profiles over these points are given as partitions of the degree $d=7$:\n    *   $\\mu_1 = (4,3)$\n    *   $\\mu_2 = (5,2)$\n    *   $\\mu_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$\n    *   $\\mu_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$\n    The use of \"respectively\" implies that the branch points are distinguishable (labelled).\n\nThe Hurwitz number can be computed combinatorially by counting factorizations in the symmetric group $S_d$. A cover corresponds to a tuple of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in $S_7$ such that:\n1.  $\\sigma_i$ has a cycle type corresponding to the partition $\\mu_i$.\n2.  The product of the permutations is the identity: $\\sigma_4 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\text{id}$.\n3.  The group generated by these permutations, $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$, acts transitively on the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. This corresponds to the cover being connected.\n\nThe Hurwitz number, in this context, is the number of such tuples of permutations, possibly weighted by the inverse of the size of the cover's automorphism group.\n\n### **Step 2: Check the genus of the cover using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula**\n\nThe Riemann-Hurwitz formula relates the genus of the cover ($g$), the genus of the base ($g_0$), the degree ($d$), and the ramification data:\n$2g - 2 = d(2g_0 - 2) + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (d - l(\\mu_i))$\nwhere $l(\\mu_i)$ is the number of parts in the partition $\\mu_i$.\n\n*   Base space is $\\mathbb{P}^1$, so its genus $g_0 = 0$.\n*   Degree $d=7$.\n*   $l(\\mu_1) = l(4,3) = 2$\n*   $l(\\mu_2) = l(5,2) = 2$\n*   $l(\\mu_3) = l(2,1^5) = 6$\n*   $l(\\mu_4) = l(2,1^5) = 6$\n\nThe sum of ramification indices is:\n$\\sum (d - l(\\mu_i)) = (7-2) + (7-2) + (7-6) + (7-6) = 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$2g - 2 = 7(2(0) - 2) + 12$\n$2g - 2 = -14 + 12 = -2$\n$2g = 0 \\implies g = 0$.\n\nThe cover has genus 0, meaning it is also a Riemann sphere ($\\mathbb{P}^1$). A crucial theorem states that for genus 0 covers, the transitivity condition is automatically satisfied. Thus, we only need to count all valid factorizations of the identity.\n\n### **Step 3: Use the character formula to count factorizations**\n\nThe number of tuples $(\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_k)$ where $\\sigma_i$ is in conjugacy class $C_i$ and their product is the identity is given by the Frobenius-Schur formula:\n$N = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k |C_i|}{|S_d|} \\sum_{\\chi} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k \\chi(\\sigma_i)}{\\chi(\\text{id})^{k-2}}$\nwhere the sum is over all irreducible characters $\\chi$ of $S_d$. For this problem, $d=7$ and $k=4$.\n\n**a) Calculate the sizes of the conjugacy classes in $S_7$:**\n*   $|C_1| = |C_{(4,3)}| = \\frac{7!}{4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{5040}{12} = 420$.\n*   $|C_2| = |C_{(5,2)}| = \\frac{7!}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5040}{10} = 504$.\n*   $|C_3| = |C_{(2,1^5)}| = \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 21$.\n*   $|C_4| = |C_{(2,1^5)}| = 21$.\n\n**b) Compute the sum over characters of $S_7$:**\nThe formula requires character values for the specified conjugacy classes. We only need to consider characters that are non-zero for all the specified classes.\nLet $\\chi^\\lambda(\\mu)$ be the character of the representation corresponding to partition $\\lambda$ on the class of cycle type $\\mu$. We need the term $\\frac{\\chi(\\mu_1)\\chi(\\mu_2)\\chi(\\mu_3)\\chi(\\mu_4)}{\\chi(\\text{id})^2}$.\n\nUsing a standard character table for $S_7$, the non-zero contributions to the sum come from the following irreducible representations (partitions $\\lambda$ of 7):\n\n| $\\lambda$ | $\\chi^{\\lambda}(\\text{id})$ | $\\chi^{\\lambda}(2,1^5)$ | $\\chi^{\\lambda}(4,3)$ | $\\chi^{\\lambda}(5,2)$ | Contribution to sum $\\left(\\frac{\\chi(4,3)\\chi(5,2)(\\chi(2,1^5))^2}{(\\chi(\\text{id}))^2}\\right)$ |\n|:----------|:-------------------------|:------------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| $(7)$     | 1                        | 1                       | 1                     | 1                     | $\\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1^2}{1^2} = 1$                                                                    |\n| $(5,2)$   | 14                       | 6                       | -1                    | -1                    | $\\frac{(-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 6^2}{14^2} = \\frac{36}{196} = \\frac{9}{49}$                                    |\n| $(4,3)$   | 14                       | -2                      | 1                     | -1                    | $\\frac{1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-2)^2}{14^2} = \\frac{-4}{196} = -\\frac{1}{49}$                                   |\n| $(3,2,2)$ | 21                       | 3                       | -1                    | -1                    | $\\frac{(-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 3^2}{21^2} = \\frac{9}{441} = \\frac{1}{49}$                                     |\n| $(2^3,1)$ | 14                       | 2                       | 1                     | 1                     | $\\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2^2}{14^2} = \\frac{4}{196} = \\frac{1}{49}$                                         |\n| $(1^7)$   | 1                        | -1                      | -1                    | -1                    | $\\frac{(-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)^2}{1^2} = 1$                                                           |\n\nSumming these contributions:\n$\\sum = 1 + \\frac{9}{49} - \\frac{1}{49} + \\frac{1}{49} + \\frac{1}{49} + 1 = 2 + \\frac{9-1+1+1}{49} = 2 + \\frac{10}{49} = \\frac{98+10}{49} = \\frac{108}{49}$.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the final Hurwitz number**\n\nThe Hurwitz number $H$ we are looking for is the number of such factorization tuples. For genus 0, all factorizations are transitive, and it can be shown that the automorphism group of such a generic cover is trivial. Thus, the character formula directly gives the integer number of covers.\n$H = N = \\frac{|C_1||C_2||C_3||C_4|}{|S_7|} \\times (\\text{sum from character table})$\n$H = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 21}{5040} \\cdot \\frac{108}{49}$\n\nLet's compute this value:\n$H = \\frac{420}{5040} \\cdot 504 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 21 \\cdot \\frac{108}{49}$\n$H = \\frac{1}{12} \\cdot 504 \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{108}{49}$\nSince $504 / 12 = 42$ and $441 / 49 = 9$:\n$H = 42 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 108$\n$H = 378 \\cdot 108$\n$H = 40824$.\n\nThe Hurwitz number is 40824."
