    "**1. Understanding the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graphs in question have a set of 5 distinct vertices.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than 2 vertices and it remains connected even after removing any single vertex. A vertex whose removal disconnects a connected graph is called a \"cut vertex\" or an \"articulation point\". Therefore, a graph is 2-vertex-connected if and only if it is connected and has no cut vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are looking for graphs with distinct structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if one can be turned into the other by simply relabeling the vertices. We want to count each unique structure only once.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nTo find the number of such graphs, we will analyze the possibilities based on the number of edges, `m`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Minimum Degree Condition**\nA necessary condition for a graph to be 2-vertex-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex, denoted `δ(G)`, must be at least 2. If a graph had a vertex `v` with degree 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex (unless the graph is simply K2, which only has 2 vertices). For a graph with 5 vertices, this means `δ(G) ≥ 2`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Minimum Number of Edges**\nThe sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (`2m`). If every one of the 5 vertices has a degree of at least 2, the sum of degrees must be at least `5 * 2 = 10`. Therefore, `2m ≥ 10`, which implies `m ≥ 5`. This significantly narrows our search, as we only need to consider graphs with 5 or more edges. The maximum possible number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is `C(5,2) = 10`.\n\nWe will now count the number of 2-vertex-connected nonisomorphic graphs for each possible number of edges from `m=5` to `m=10`.\n\n*   **Case m = 5:**\n    For the sum of degrees to be `2 * 5 = 10`, and with the condition that `δ(G) ≥ 2`, every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2. The only nonisomorphic simple graph on 5 vertices where every vertex has degree 2 is the 5-cycle (C5). A cycle graph C_n (for n≥3) is always 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n*   **Case m = 6:**\n    The sum of degrees is 12. We need to find all 2-connected nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. There are three such graphs:\n    1.  The complete bipartite graph K(2,3).\n    2.  The \"House graph\" (a C4 with a C3 sharing one of its edges).\n    3.  The 5-cycle with one chord (an edge connecting two non-adjacent vertices).\n    All three can be verified to be 2-connected (they lack any cut vertices).\n    *   **Count for m=6: 3**\n\n*   **Case m = 7:**\n    Analysis of all nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 7 edges shows that there are three that are 2-connected. These can be constructed by adding an edge in all non-isomorphic ways to the 2-connected graphs with 6 edges. The resulting graphs are:\n    1.  One graph with degree sequence (3,3,3,3,2).\n    2.  Two non-isomorphic graphs with degree sequence (4,3,3,2,2).\n    All three are 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=7: 3**\n\n*   **Case m = 8:**\n    **Careful Point 3: Using Complements for Dense Graphs.** For dense graphs, it's easier to analyze their complements. The number of nonisomorphic graphs with `m` edges is the same as the number with `C(5,2) - m` edges. Here, the complement has `10 - 8 = 2` edges. There are two nonisomorphic graphs with 2 edges: a) two disjoint edges, and b) a path of length 2 (two edges sharing a vertex). The complements of these are the two nonisomorphic graphs with 8 edges. Both of these graphs, being very dense, are 2-connected.\n    1.  K5 minus two disjoint edges (this is the Wheel Graph, W5).\n    2.  K5 minus two adjacent edges.\n    *   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n*   **Case m = 9:**\n    The complement has `10 - 9 = 1` edge. There is only one graph with 1 edge. Its complement is K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). This graph is 3-connected, and therefore also 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n*   **Case m = 10:**\n    The complement has `10 - 10 = 0` edges (the empty graph). Its complement is the complete graph K5. K5 is 4-connected, and therefore also 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n**3. Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1 graph\n*   m=6: 3 graphs\n*   m=7: 3 graphs\n*   m=8: 2 graphs\n*   m=9: 1 graph\n*   m=10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 such graphs.\n\n<<<11>>>"
