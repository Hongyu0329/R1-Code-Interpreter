    "This question requires a deep understanding of the specific techniques of the five standard ballroom dances. Let's break down the concepts involved.\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n\n1.  **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left.\n2.  **Overturning:** To rotate more than the amount prescribed by the official technique for a given figure. For example, if a step should have 3/8 of a turn, turning 1/2 would be overturning.\n3.  **\"Without disregarding the technique\":** This is the crucial part of the question. It means we must consider the fundamental principles and defining characteristics of each dance. An action is considered \"impossible\" if performing it requires violating the core rules of that dance's technique.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Dance:**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:**\n    *   These four dances are known as \"swing dances.\" A primary characteristic of swing dances is the continuous, flowing movement generated by body swing, which is a pendulum-like motion of the body.\n    *   Turns in these dances are created through a combination of footwork, body swing, sway, and Contrary Body Movement (CBM).\n    *   Because the turn is a product of continuous, flowing motion (swing), the amount of turn is not rigidly fixed. A dancer can use more or less swing and body rotation to slightly alter the amount of turn.\n    *   While the syllabus prescribes a standard amount of turn for a figure like the Reverse Turn, it is technically possible for a dancer to \"overturn\" it by applying more rotational energy. This might be done for floorcraft (to avoid other couples) or for stylistic reasons. Although it might be considered poor technique if done excessively or incorrectly, the action of adding more rotation does not violate the fundamental principle of \"swing.\" It's just a variation in the amount of swing. Therefore, overturning is not impossible.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:**\n    *   Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its core technique is characterized by sharp, staccato actions, no rise and fall, and a very specific use of CBM that is different from the swing dances. Most importantly, Tango has **no swing**.\n    *   Turns in Tango are not generated by a flowing, pendulum-like motion. Instead, they are executed as sharp, controlled pivots or swivels, often happening *between* steps rather than throughout a step.\n    *   Let's consider the classic Tango Reverse Turn (specifically, the Reverse Turn with Lady Outside). The amount of turn is precisely defined by the foot placements and the sharp pivoting action on the standing foot. For the Leader, the turn is a very specific 1/4 between steps 1 and 2, and another 1/8 between steps 2 and 3.\n    *   To overturn this figure—that is, to get significantly more rotation—a dancer would have to introduce a swinging or continuous rotational action.\n    *   However, introducing swing is a direct violation of the fundamental technique of Tango. The moment you add a swing action to a Tango turn, you are no longer dancing Tango technique; you are importing a technique from a different dance.\n    *   Therefore, within the strict rules and character of Tango, it is impossible to overturn the Reverse Turn *without disregarding the technique* itself. The action required to overturn it is forbidden by the dance's core principles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, etc.), overturning is possible because you can simply apply more of the same type of action (swing) that creates the turn. In Tango, the turn is created by a non-swing, pivoting action. To overturn it, you would have to add swing, which fundamentally breaks the rules of Tango technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
