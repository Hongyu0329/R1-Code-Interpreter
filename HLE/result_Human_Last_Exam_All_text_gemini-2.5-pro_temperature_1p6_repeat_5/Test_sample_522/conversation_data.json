    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle's transformation rule.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of Inputs and Outputs\nThe inputs and outputs are strings representing 2D grids of numbers ('0', '1', '2'), with rows separated by commas. The transformation involves changing the positions of some numbers within the grid. In each case, a single '2' moves to a new position, and its old position becomes a '0'.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Transformation in `Input_A` to `Output_A`\n*   **Input_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The '2' at position (1, 1) has moved to position (0, 0). The original position (1, 1) has become '0', and the destination (0, 0), which was originally '0', has become '2'. Essentially, `Grid[1][1]` and `Grid[0][0]` have swapped values. The question is: why did the '2' move to (0, 0)?\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Transformation in `Input_B` to `Output_B`\n*   **Input_B Grid (relevant part):**\n    ```\n    ...0 0 0... (row 2)\n    ...0 2 1... (row 3, '2' is at index 6, so (3,6))\n    ...1 1 1... (row 4)\n    ```\n*   **Output_B Grid (relevant part):**\n    ```\n    ...0 2 1... (row 2, '2' is at index 7, so (2,7))\n    ...0 0 1... (row 3)\n    ...1 1 1... (row 4)\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The '2' at position (3, 6) moved to position (2, 7). The original position (3, 6) became '0', and the destination (2, 7), originally '0', became '2'.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis for the Movement Rule\nIn both cases, the '2' moves to one of its eight neighboring cells that contains a '0'. The core of the puzzle is to determine the selection criteria when multiple neighboring '0's exist.\n\nLet's test a hypothesis based on prioritizing diagonal moves.\n\n**Hypothesis:** The '2' prefers to move to a diagonal neighbor containing a '0'. If there are multiple such diagonal '0's, a tie-breaking rule is applied.\n\nLet's find the specific rule.\n*   **Case A:** The '2' is at (1,1).\n    *   Diagonal neighbors: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2).\n    *   Values: '0', '1', '1', '1'.\n    *   There is only one diagonal neighbor with a '0', which is at (0,0). The '2' moves there. This fits.\n\n*   **Case B:** The '2' is at (3,6).\n    *   Diagonal neighbors: (2,5), (2,7), (4,5), (4,7).\n    *   Values: '0', '0', '1', '1'.\n    *   There are two diagonal neighbors with a '0': (2,5) and (2,7). The '2' moved to (2,7). We need a tie-breaker.\n    *   Let's try a coordinate-based rule: \"select the cell with the minimum row index, then the maximum column index\".\n    *   Candidates: (2,5) and (2,7).\n    *   Both have the same minimum row index (2).\n    *   Comparing their column indices (5 and 7), the maximum is 7.\n    *   This selects (2,7), which matches the output.\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\n1.  Find all diagonal neighbors of the '2' that contain a '0'.\n2.  If any exist, select one using a tie-breaking rule: choose the one with the minimum row index. If there's still a tie, choose the one with the maximum column index.\n3.  The '2' swaps places with the selected '0'.\n4.  If no diagonal '0's exist, a different rule for cardinal neighbors might apply (though not needed for the given examples).\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Rule to `Input_C` to Find `MISSING`\n*   **Input_C Grid:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   The '2' is at position (1, 4).\n\n1.  **Find diagonal '0' neighbors:**\n    *   Up-Left (0,3): The value is '0'. This is a candidate.\n    *   Up-Right (0,5): The value is '0'. This is a candidate.\n    *   Down-Left (2,3): The value is '1'.\n    *   Down-Right (2,5): The value is '1'.\n    *   The candidate positions are (0,3) and (0,5).\n\n2.  **Apply the tie-breaking rule:** \"minimum row, then maximum column\".\n    *   Both candidates are in row 0, which is the minimum row.\n    *   We compare their column indices: 3 and 5. The maximum is 5.\n    *   The chosen destination for the '2' is (0,5).\n\n3.  **Perform the transformation:**\n    *   The '2' at (1,4) moves to (0,5).\n    *   The value at (1,4) becomes '0'.\n    *   The value at (0,5) becomes '2'.\n\n4.  **Construct the final grid:**\n    *   The first row `000000` becomes `000002`.\n    *   The second row `011120` becomes `011100`.\n    *   The third row `111111` remains unchanged.\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** Combining the new rows gives the string `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
