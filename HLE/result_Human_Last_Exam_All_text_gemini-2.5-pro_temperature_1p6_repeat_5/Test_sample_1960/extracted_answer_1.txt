**Function f:**
Let `K` and `U` be two distinct, literal-free formulas (e.g., `K = (1 ⊸ ⊥)` and `U = ⊥`). For a natural number `w`, the function `f` is defined as:
$f(w) = K \multimap (K \otimes U^{\otimes w})$
where `A^{\otimes n}` denotes the formula `A` tensored with itself `n` times.

**Formula C:**
The formula `C`, which depends on the natural numbers `m` and `b`, is defined as:
$C(W, m, b) = K^{\otimes m} \multimap (K \otimes U^{\otimes b})^{\otimes m}$
