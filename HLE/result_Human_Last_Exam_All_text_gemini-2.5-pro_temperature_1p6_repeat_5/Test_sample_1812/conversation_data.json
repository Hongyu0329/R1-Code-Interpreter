    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe problem asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix, which is provided in the question.\nThe matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the contextual information.**\nThe question refers to this matrix as \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n*   **\"Adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver\"**: This is a term from a specialized area of mathematics (likely related to graph theory, representation theory, or cluster algebras). It serves to identify the matrix A in its specific context.\n*   **\"for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\"**: This seems to be a parameter value that specifies the particular instance of the problem.\n*   **Careful Point**: The crucial part is that the problem explicitly provides the matrix \\(A\\). It does not ask us to construct the matrix from the contextual information. The formula for matrix A is given with constant numerical entries. There are no variables like 'm' in the matrix definition. Therefore, the contextual information serves as a name or identifier for the matrix, but the calculation only requires the matrix itself. The core task is to compute the determinant of the given matrix \\(A\\).\n\n**Step 3: Choose a method for calculating the determinant.**\nFor a 3x3 matrix, we can use several methods:\n1.  The Sarrus rule.\n2.  Cofactor expansion.\n3.  Row/column operations to simplify the matrix into a form (like upper/lower triangular) where the determinant is easy to compute.\n4.  Observing properties of the matrix (like linear dependence of rows/columns).\n\nLet's use method 4 as it is often the quickest if a property can be spotted.\n\n**Step 4: Execute the calculation.**\n**Method 4: Using properties of the matrix**\nObserve the sum of the elements in each row:\n*   Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n\nSince the sum of the elements in each row is 0, the columns are linearly dependent. Specifically, if we add the second and third columns to the first column, we get a column of zeros.\nA property of determinants is that if the columns (or rows) of a matrix are linearly dependent, the determinant is 0.\nThis can also be seen by the fact that the vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0, because \\( A\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\). Since 0 is an eigenvalue, the determinant (which is the product of all eigenvalues) must be 0.\n\n**Alternative Method 3: Using Row Operations**\nLet's add Row 1 and Row 2 to Row 3. This operation does not change the value of the determinant.\nLet \\(R_1, R_2, R_3\\) be the rows of the matrix. The new third row \\(R_3'\\) will be \\(R_1 + R_2 + R_3\\).\n\\( R_3' = [ (2) + (-1) + (-1), \\quad (-1) + (2) + (-1), \\quad (-1) + (-1) + (2) ] \\)\n\\( R_3' = [ 0, \\quad 0, \\quad 0 ] \\)\nThe new matrix becomes:\n\\[\nA' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant of a matrix with a row of zeros is 0. Therefore, \\(\\det(A) = \\det(A') = 0\\).\n\n**Alternative Method 1: Sarrus' Rule**\n\\(\\det(A) = (2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2) + (-1 \\cdot -1 \\cdot -1) + (-1 \\cdot -1 \\cdot -1) - ((-1) \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-1)) - (2 \\cdot -1 \\cdot -1) - ((-1) \\cdot -1 \\cdot 2)\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 8 + (-1) + (-1) - (2) - (2) - (2)\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 8 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 2\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 8 - 8 = 0\\)\n\nAll methods consistently yield the same result.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formulation**\nThe step-by-step analysis has shown that despite the complex-sounding terminology, the problem boils down to a straightforward determinant calculation of a given matrix. All reliable methods of calculation confirm that the determinant is 0.\n\nFinal Answer: The determinant of the matrix \\(A\\) is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
