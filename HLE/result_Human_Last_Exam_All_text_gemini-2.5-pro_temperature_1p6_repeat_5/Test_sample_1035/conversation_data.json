    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement**:\n    *   **Complete Graph \\(K_n\\)**: A graph on \\(n\\) vertices where every distinct pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Here, \\(n=35\\).\n    *   **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, U and V, such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.\n    *   **Family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges**: This means we have a collection of bipartite graphs, say \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\), and the union of their edge sets is equal to the edge set of \\(K_n\\). Formally, \\(\\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(B_i) = E(K_n)\\).\n    *   **Minimum number of vertices in a family**: This phrase is ambiguous and is the most critical part of the question to analyze.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Ambiguous Phrase**:\n    The phrase \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" could have several meanings. Let's consider the plausible interpretations:\n    *   **Interpretation A: The number of graphs in the family.** This would mean the question asks for the minimum value of \\(k\\). In mathematical language, this is the size or cardinality of the family (which is a set of graphs). This phrasing, while slightly unconventional, points to a well-known problem in graph theory.\n    *   **Interpretation B: The total number of vertices involved.** This would mean finding the minimum size of the union of the vertex sets of the graphs in the family, i.e., \\(\\min |\\bigcup_{i=1}^k V(B_i)|\\). Since the bipartite graphs must cover all edges of \\(K_{35}\\), and every vertex in \\(K_{35}\\) is part of at least one edge (its degree is 34), every vertex must be included in at least one of the bipartite graphs. Therefore, the union of the vertex sets must be the vertex set of \\(K_{35}\\), which has 35 vertices. This interpretation makes the problem trivial, with an answer of 35.\n    *   **Interpretation C: The sum of the number of vertices in each graph.** This would mean minimizing \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|\\). This is a highly complex optimization problem that goes beyond the standard theorems and would likely not have a simple integer answer.\n\n3.  **Selecting the Most Likely Interpretation**:\n    Interpretation A aligns with a classic result in extremal graph theory. Problems in mathematics contests and assignments are usually designed to test knowledge of significant theorems. Interpretations B and C make the problem either trivial or exceedingly difficult. Therefore, it is most probable that the question is asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover \\(K_n\\), and the wording \"number of vertices in a family\" is a slight misstatement for \"number of graphs in a family\".\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Phrasing**: The primary challenge is correctly interpreting \"number of vertices in a family\". As reasoned above, this most likely means the number of graphs in the family.\n2.  **Covering vs. Partitioning**: The question asks for a \"covering\" of edges, which means edges can be in more than one bipartite graph. The relevant theorem, the Graham-Pollak theorem, is often stated for \"partitioning\" (where each edge belongs to exactly one graph). However, the lower bound of the theorem holds for covering as well. If you can cover \\(K_n\\) with \\(k\\) graphs, you can also partition it into at most \\(k\\) graphs. Thus, the minimum number is the same for both problems.\n3.  **Bipartite vs. Complete Bipartite**: The theorem is often stated for decomposition into *complete* bipartite graphs. The question allows for any *bipartite* graphs. Since any bipartite graph is a subgraph of a complete bipartite graph, a covering by \\(k\\) bipartite graphs implies a covering by \\(k\\) complete bipartite graphs. Therefore, the minimum number is the same.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nFollowing Interpretation A, we proceed with the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Formalize the problem.**\nWe need to find the minimum integer \\(k\\) such that the edge set of \\(K_{35}\\) can be expressed as the union of the edge sets of \\(k\\) bipartite subgraphs.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Graham-Pollak Theorem.**\nThe Graham-Pollak theorem (1971) states that the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs whose edges partition the edges of a complete graph \\(K_n\\) is exactly \\(n-1\\). As discussed in the \"Careful Points\", this result directly applies to our problem of covering with general bipartite graphs.\n\n**Step 3: Construct an upper bound (proof of existence).**\nWe can show that \\(n-1\\) bipartite graphs are sufficient. Let the vertices of \\(K_n\\) be \\(v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\).\nWe can construct \\(n-1\\) star graphs (which are a type of complete bipartite graph, \\(K_{1,m}\\)).\n*   \\(B_1\\): The star graph with center \\(v_1\\) and leaves \\(v_2, v_3, \\ldots, v_n\\). This covers all edges incident to \\(v_1\\).\n*   \\(B_2\\): The star graph with center \\(v_2\\) and leaves \\(v_3, v_4, \\ldots, v_n\\). This covers all remaining edges incident to \\(v_2\\).\n*   ...\n*   \\(B_{n-1}\\): The star graph with center \\(v_{n-1}\\) and leaf \\(v_n\\). This covers the final remaining edge \\((v_{n-1}, v_n)\\).\nThis family of \\(n-1\\) star graphs partitions (and therefore covers) all edges of \\(K_n\\). This shows that the minimum number is at most \\(n-1\\).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the lower bound from the theorem.**\nThe Graham-Pollak theorem provides the lower bound, stating that it is impossible to cover the edges of \\(K_n\\) with fewer than \\(n-1\\) bipartite graphs.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and calculate.**\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover \\(K_n\\) is exactly \\(n-1\\).\nFor the given problem, \\(n = 35\\).\nMinimum number of graphs = \\(35 - 1 = 34\\).\n\n<<<34>>>"
