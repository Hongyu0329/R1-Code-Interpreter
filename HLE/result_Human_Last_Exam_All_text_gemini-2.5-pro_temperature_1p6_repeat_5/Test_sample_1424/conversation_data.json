    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, a list of careful points, and the final derivation of the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral Formalism**: This is a formulation of quantum mechanics where the probability amplitude for a process is the sum (or functional integral) over all possible histories or \"paths\" of the system between the initial and final states. Each path is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where S is the classical action for that path.\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**: Also known as the non-interacting Green's function or free propagator. It describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle from one spacetime point to another. It is a fundamental building block in quantum field theory and many-body physics, from which the effects of interactions can be calculated perturbatively.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)**: These are the allowed energy levels for a single particle in the absence of interactions. They are the eigenvalues of the non-interacting Hamiltonian, $H_0$. The index `k` represents the set of quantum numbers (e.g., momentum, spin) that specify the single-particle state.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Green's Function via the Path Integral**\n\nThe Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of a time-ordered product of field operators. For a non-interacting theory of fermions, it is:\n$G_0(x', t'; x, t) = -i \\langle \\text{vac} | T[\\psi(x', t') \\psi^\\dagger(x, t)] | \\text{vac} \\rangle$\n\nIn the path integral formalism, this is calculated as:\n$G_0(x', t'; x, t) = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x', t') \\psi^\\dagger(x, t) \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]/\\hbar}}$\n\nwhere $S_0$ is the action for the non-interacting system:\n$S_0[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^3x \\, \\psi^\\dagger(x, t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\psi(x, t)$\n\nThe key insight is that the Green's function is the inverse of the operator found in the quadratic part of the action. Let's call this operator $\\mathcal{K}_0 = (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0)$. Then, symbolically, $G_0 = \\mathcal{K}_0^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Work in the Energy-Momentum Representation**\n\nTo find the explicit dependence on $\\epsilon_k$, it is most convenient to work in a basis where the Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal. For a system with translational invariance, this is the momentum basis. Let $|k\\rangle$ be the eigenstates of $H_0$ such that $H_0|k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k|k\\rangle$.\n\nWe perform a Fourier transform from the position-time basis $(x,t)$ to the momentum-frequency basis $(k, \\omega)$.\n*   The time derivative becomes: $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega$\n*   The Hamiltonian operator becomes its eigenvalue: $H_0 \\rightarrow \\epsilon_k$\n\nApplying this transform to the operator $\\mathcal{K}_0$, we get its representation in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis:\n$\\mathcal{K}_0(k, \\omega) = \\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k$\n\n**Step 4: Invert the Operator to Find G₀**\n\nSince the Green's function is the inverse of this operator, we can find its form in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis by simple algebraic inversion:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = [\\mathcal{K}_0(k, \\omega)]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 5: Introduce the Causal Propagator (Feynman's $i\\eta$ prescription)**\n\nThe expression above has a singularity (a pole) when $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. The path integral formalism provides a specific prescription for handling this pole, which ensures causality (effects cannot precede their causes). This is done by adding a small imaginary infinitesimal, $i\\eta$ (with $\\eta \\rightarrow 0^+$), to the denominator. This shifts the pole slightly off the real energy axis. The precise form for the Feynman propagator is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential (or Fermi energy). For states above the Fermi energy (unoccupied), the term is $+i\\eta$. For states below the Fermi energy (occupied), it is $-i\\eta$. For a simple single-particle propagation problem (no Fermi sea), the prescription is simply:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the Final Functional Dependence**\n\nLooking at the final expression, we can clearly see the relationship:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is that **the value of $\\epsilon_k$ determines the location of a simple pole of $G_0$ in the complex energy plane.** For each state $k$, there is a corresponding pole at the complex energy $E = \\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k - i\\eta$. The set of all single-particle energies $\\{\\epsilon_k\\}$ defines the entire pole structure of the non-interacting Green's function.\n\n---\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Time vs. Frequency Domain**: The relationship between $G_0$ and $\\epsilon_k$ is simplest and most direct in the frequency (or energy) domain. In the time domain, $\\epsilon_k$ appears as the frequency of oscillation in the expression $e^{-i\\epsilon_k t/\\hbar}$.\n2.  **Bare vs. Interacting**: This analysis is for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$), which corresponds to a non-interacting system ($H_0$). When interactions are included, the poles of the full Green's function ($G$) are shifted away from $\\epsilon_k$ and may acquire a finite imaginary part, corresponding to the energy shift and finite lifetime of the quasiparticle.\n3.  **The Role of $i\\eta$**: The infinitesimal imaginary part $i\\eta$ is not just a mathematical convenience; it is physically crucial. It is automatically generated by the boundary conditions of the Feynman path integral and ensures that the propagator has the correct causal structure. Its sign determines whether the Green's function is retarded, advanced, or the Feynman propagator.\n4.  **Inverse Relationship**: The Green's function is the *inverse* of the operator in the action ($i\\hbar\\partial_t - H_0$). This means the poles of the Green's function correspond to the zeros of its inverse. The energies $\\epsilon_k$ are where the inverse propagator, $\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k$, is zero.\n5.  **Spectral Representation**: The final result, when transformed back to the position basis, is $G_0(x', x; \\omega) = \\sum_k \\frac{\\phi_k(x')\\phi_k^*(x)}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, where $\\phi_k(x)$ are the single-particle eigenfunctions. This shows that the full propagator is a sum over the contributions from all single-particle modes, each with its characteristic pole at $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function in the energy-momentum representation, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the inverse of the operator in the quadratic part of the non-interacting action. This leads to the expression:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nThe functional dependence is therefore that **the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ determine the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the complex energy axis.** Specifically, for each single-particle state indexed by $k$, its energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ creates a simple pole in $G_0$ at the complex energy $E = \\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k - i\\eta$.\n\n<<<The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are the real parts of the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function $G_0$ in the complex energy (or frequency) plane. The relationship is of the form $G_0 \\propto (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.>>>"
