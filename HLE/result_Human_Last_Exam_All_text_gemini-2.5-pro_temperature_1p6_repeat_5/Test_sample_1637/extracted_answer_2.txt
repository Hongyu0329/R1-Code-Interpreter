Yes, it is highly likely that changing the linker to incorporate a longer Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) chain will solve the precipitation problem. The observed precipitation is a direct result of the probe's low aqueous solubility, caused by its large hydrophobic thioxanthenone core and hexyl chain. PEG chains are extremely hydrophilic and are a standard, well-established tool in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry to increase the water solubility of hydrophobic molecules. By adding a sufficiently long PEG chain, the overall hydrophilicity of the probe will increase, which should prevent it from precipitating out of the aqueous cell culture medium at the desired concentration.
