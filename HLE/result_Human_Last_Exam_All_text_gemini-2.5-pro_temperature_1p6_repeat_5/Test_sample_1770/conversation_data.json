    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism and the Product:** The organism is *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, and the desired product to accumulate is p-coumaric acid (also known as 4-hydroxycinnamic acid).\n2.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The engineered strain produces p-coumaric acid, but a native metabolic pathway in *C. glutamicum* degrades it. To prevent this, we must identify and disable the first dedicated step in this degradation pathway.\n3.  **Research the Catabolic Pathway of p-Coumaric Acid in *C. glutamicum*:** In many bacteria, including *C. glutamicum*, aromatic compounds like p-coumaric acid are catabolized for use as carbon sources. The major degradation pathway for p-coumaric acid and similar phenylpropanoids (like ferulic acid) involves conversion to protocatechuate (PCA), which then enters the central metabolism via the Î²-ketoadipate pathway.\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Step of Degradation:** For degradation to occur, p-coumaric acid must first be \"activated.\" In this specific pathway, the activation step is the conversion of p-coumaric acid to its corresponding CoA thioester, p-coumaroyl-CoA. This is a common strategy in cellular metabolism to prepare a molecule for subsequent enzymatic reactions.\n5.  **Identify the Enzyme and Gene for the First Step:** The enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of Coenzyme A (CoA) to p-coumaric acid is a type of CoA ligase. In *C. glutamicum*, this enzyme is known as **Feruloyl-CoA synthetase**. It exhibits broad substrate specificity and can act on ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and, importantly for this problem, p-coumaric acid. The gene encoding this enzyme is designated as **`fcs`**.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Targeting the right step:** It is crucial to block the very first step of the degradation pathway. If a downstream gene (e.g., one that acts on p-coumaroyl-CoA or a later intermediate) were knocked out, the cell would accumulate an intermediate metabolite instead of the desired p-coumaric acid. Accumulation of intermediates like p-coumaroyl-CoA can also be toxic to the cell.\n*   **Gene Specificity:** The `fcs` gene is the specific gene in *C. glutamicum* responsible for activating p-coumarate for degradation. Knocking it out is a well-established strategy in metabolic engineering of this organism for producing p-coumarate-derived compounds.\n*   **Conclusion:** By knocking out the `fcs` gene, the cell loses the ability to convert p-coumaric acid into p-coumaroyl-CoA. This effectively blocks the entry of p-coumaric acid into the catabolic pathway, causing the desired product to accumulate extracellularly or intracellularly instead of being degraded.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the gene that should be knocked out is the one encoding Feruloyl-CoA synthetase, which catalyzes the first step in the degradation of p-coumaric acid.\n\n<<<fcs>>>"
