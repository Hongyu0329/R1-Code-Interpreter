No, it is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the customary mathematics of quantum mechanics. The two systems are fundamentally incompatible. Gödel's proof is a theorem within formal modal logic, which deals with abstract concepts like "positive property" and "metaphysical necessity." The mathematics of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators, etc.) is a framework designed to model the probabilistic behavior of physical systems. The core concepts and logical structure required for Gödel's proof have no meaningful equivalent within the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics.
