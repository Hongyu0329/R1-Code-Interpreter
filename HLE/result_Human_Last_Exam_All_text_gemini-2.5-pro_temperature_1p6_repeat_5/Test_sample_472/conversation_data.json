    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Line and Meter:**\n    *   The line is \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n    *   This line comes from Roman comedy (Plautus, *Captivi*, 203) and is written in **iambic senarius**. This meter consists of six iambic feet (S L). However, Plautine meter allows for frequent substitutions.\n\n2.  **Handle Phonological Phenomena (Elision):**\n    *   There is one clear case of elision: the word `bene` ends in `-e`, and the next word `esse` begins with `e-`.\n    *   The `-e` of `bene` is elided: `ben(e) esse` becomes `ben' esse`.\n\n3.  **Syllabify the Line and Determine Syllable Count:**\n    *   Let's break the line into syllables, including the elision.\n    *   `et | ti | bi | be | n'es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n    *   Counting these gives a total of 14 syllables. An iambic senarius with substitutions can have this length (e.g., four 2-syllable feet and two 3-syllable feet).\n\n4.  **Determine Vowel and Syllable Quantities (L for Long, S for Short):**\n    *   `et`: The vowel `e` is short by nature, but the syllable is \"long by position\" because it is followed by two consonants (`t` from `et` and `t` from `tibi`). So, `et` is **L**.\n    *   `tibi`: Both vowels are short by nature (`tĭbĭ`). The syllables are open. So, `ti` is **S**, `bi` is **S**.\n    *   `ben' esse`: This is analyzed as three syllables: `be-nes-se`.\n        *   `be-`: open syllable with a short vowel (`bĕne`). So, `be` is **S**.\n        *   `-nes-`: This syllable is closed by the `-s-` of `esse`. So, `nes` is **L**.\n        *   `-se`: open syllable with a short vowel (`essĕ`). So, `se` is **S**.\n        The whole phrase `ben' esse` scans as `S L S`.\n    *   `soli`: This is the dative singular of `solus`. The `o` is naturally long (`sōlus`) and the dative singular ending is long (`-ī`). So, `so` is **L**, `li` is **L**.\n    *   `quom`: An archaic spelling of `cum`. The vowel is long. So, `quom` is **L**.\n    *   `sibi`: Like `tibi`, both vowels are short (`sĭbĭ`). So, `si` is **S**, `bi` is **S**.\n    *   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by `-t`. So, `sit` is **L**.\n    *   `male`: This is the adverb `mălĕ`. Both vowels are short. So, `ma` is **S**, `le` is **S**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Full Sequence of Syllables:**\n    *   The complete pattern of long and short syllables is:\n        `L S S S L S L L L S S L S S`\n\n6.  **Divide the Line into Six Metrical Feet:**\n    *   The goal is to divide the 14-syllable sequence into six feet, using valid iambic senarius substitutions (like spondee `L L`, dactyl `L S S`, anapest `S S L`, etc.). The final foot must be an iamb (`S L`).\n    *   **Foot 1:** The line begins `L S S`. This perfectly forms a **dactyl** (`L S S`), a valid substitution. This foot is `et ti bi`.\n    *   **Foot 2:** The remaining sequence begins `S L S...`. The first two syllables `S L` form an **iamb**, which is the base foot. This foot is `be nes`.\n    *   **Foot 3:** The remaining sequence begins `S L L...`. The first two syllables `S L` form another **iamb**. This foot is `se so`.\n    *   **Foot 4:** The remaining sequence begins `L L L...`. The first two syllables `L L` form a **spondee**, a valid substitution. This foot is `li quom`.\n    *   **Foot 5:** The remaining sequence is `S S L S S`. The first three syllables `S S L` form an **anapest**, a valid substitution. This foot is `si bi sit`.\n    *   **Foot 6:** The final two syllables are `ma le`, with quantities `S S`. For the line to resolve, the final foot must be an iamb (`S L`). In this meter, the final syllable of the line is *anceps* (can be long or short) and is treated as long to complete the final iamb. Thus, `ma le` (`S S`) is scanned as an **iamb** (`S L`).\n\n### Final Scansion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the feet are:\n1.  `et ti bi` = **Dactyl (L S S)**\n2.  `be nes` = **Iamb (S L)**\n3.  `se so` = **Iamb (S L)**\n4.  `li quom` = **Spondee (L L)**\n5.  `si bi sit` = **Anapest (S S L)**\n6.  `ma le` = **Iamb (S L)**\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
