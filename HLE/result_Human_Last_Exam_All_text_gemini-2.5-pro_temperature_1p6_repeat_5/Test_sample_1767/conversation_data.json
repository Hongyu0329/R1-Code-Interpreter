    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System Components:** Two Chern insulators.\n    *   **Key Property:** Each insulator has a Chern number of C = 1.\n    *   **Configuration:** They are connected \"laterally\", meaning side-by-side, forming a single larger system.\n    *   **Interaction:** The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" implies they are strongly coupled, and electrons can move freely across the interface between them. The two insulators are not isolated but form a unified whole.\n    *   **Objective:** Determine the Chern number of the combined system (the \"junction\" or the new, larger insulator).\n\n2.  **Understanding the Chern Number (C):**\n    *   The Chern number is a topological invariant, a fundamental property of the material's electronic band structure that is robust against small perturbations.\n    *   Physically, it quantifies the transverse Hall conductance in units of the conductance quantum ($e^2/h$). Specifically, the Hall conductance $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n    *   Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, the Chern number also dictates the number of chiral (one-way) edge states at the boundary of the material. A system with Chern number C has |C| protected edge states propagating in one direction along its perimeter. For C=1, there is one such state.\n\n3.  **The Principle of Additivity:**\n    *   The Chern number is an additive quantity. When two independent or weakly coupled systems are combined to form a single system, the Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its constituent parts.\n    *   This can be understood from the perspective of the Hall conductance. If you apply an electric field across the combined system, the total transverse Hall current will be the sum of the currents generated in each part.\n    *   Mathematically:\n        *   $C_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{insulator 1}} + C_{\\text{insulator 2}}$\n        *   This is analogous to stacking two quantum Hall layers; the total Hall conductance is the sum of the individual conductances. Placing them side-by-side leads to the same result for the bulk topological invariant.\n\n4.  **Applying the Principle to the Scenario:**\n    *   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them A and B.\n    *   Chern number of insulator A: $C_A = 1$.\n    *   Chern number of insulator B: $C_B = 1$.\n    *   They are combined into a single system. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is:\n        *   $C_{\\text{total}} = C_A + C_B = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Edge States (Careful Point):**\n    *   This provides a physical check of our conclusion.\n    *   **Before connection:** Insulator A has one chiral edge state circulating along its boundary (e.g., counter-clockwise). Insulator B also has one counter-clockwise chiral edge state.\n    *   **At the junction:** When placed side-by-side, the right edge of A is next to the left edge of B.\n        *   The edge state on the right side of A moves in one direction (e.g., down).\n        *   The edge state on the left side of B moves in the opposite direction (e.g., up).\n    *   **Effect of \"negligible tunneling\":** These two counter-propagating edge states at the interface can now interact. This interaction causes them to \"gap out\"â€”they mix and form massive states, effectively annihilating each other. This means there are no longer any protected gapless states at the internal junction. The entire combined system now has a gapped bulk.\n    *   **New outer boundary:** The new system has a new, larger outer perimeter. On this perimeter, the edge states that do not meet a counter-propagating partner survive. For example, on the top edge, the right-moving state from A and the right-moving state from B combine to form two co-propagating states. The same happens on the other outer edges.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The combined system has a total of two chiral edge states circulating on its outer boundary. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with two chiral edge states must have a bulk Chern number of C=2. This physical picture confirms the result from the additivity principle.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Chern number of a composite system formed by joining two subsystems is the sum of their individual Chern numbers. Since each Chern insulator has a Chern number of 1, the total Chern number of the combined junction is the sum of the two.\n\n$C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
