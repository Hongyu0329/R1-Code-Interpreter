    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identifying the Diagrams**\n\nWe are considering vacuum bubble diagrams of the second order in $\\phi^4$ theory. This means we have diagrams with two vertices, and no external lines. The interaction vertex in $\\phi^4$ theory connects four field lines. Therefore, we need to find all topologically distinct ways to connect two 4-point vertices using propagators to form a connected diagram.\n\nLet the two vertices be $V_1$ and $V_2$. Each vertex has 4 \"stubs\" (or half-lines) that need to be connected. In total, we have 8 stubs, which must be connected in pairs by 4 propagators. A propagator can either connect a stub from $V_1$ to a stub from $V_2$, or connect two stubs on the same vertex.\n\nWe can classify the diagrams by the number of propagators, $n_{12}$, connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$. The number of propagators forming loops on $V_1$ is $n_{11}$, and on $V_2$ is $n_{22}$.\n\n-   The total number of propagators is 4: $n_{12} + n_{11} + n_{22} = 4$.\n-   At vertex $V_1$, the 4 stubs must be used. A line to $V_2$ uses one stub. A loop on $V_1$ uses two stubs. So, we must have $n_{12} + 2n_{11} = 4$.\n-   Similarly for vertex $V_2$: $n_{12} + 2n_{22} = 4$.\n\nFrom the second and third equations, we can see that $n_{12}$ must be an even number. We check the possible non-negative integer solutions for $n_{12}, n_{11}, n_{22}$:\n\n-   **Case 1: $n_{12} = 4$**\n    -   From $4 + 2n_{11} = 4$, we get $n_{11} = 0$.\n    -   From $4 + 2n_{22} = 4$, we get $n_{22} = 0$.\n    -   Checking the first equation: $4 + 0 + 0 = 4$. This is a valid solution.\n    -   This corresponds to a diagram where the two vertices are connected by four propagators. We call this **Diagram A** (also known as the \"figure-8\" or \"setting-sun\" diagram).\n\n-   **Case 2: $n_{12} = 2$**\n    -   From $2 + 2n_{11} = 4$, we get $n_{11} = 1$.\n    -   From $2 + 2n_{22} = 4$, we get $n_{22} = 1$.\n    -   Checking the first equation: $2 + 1 + 1 = 4$. This is a valid solution.\n    -   This corresponds to a diagram where two propagators connect the vertices, and each vertex has one self-loop. We call this **Diagram B** (also known as the \"double-scoop\" diagram).\n\n-   **Case 3: $n_{12} = 0$**\n    -   This implies the vertices are not connected to each other, resulting in a disconnected diagram. Disconnected vacuum bubbles are accounted for by the exponentiation of connected bubbles and are not counted individually in this context.\n\nThis systematic enumeration reveals that there are only **two** topologically distinct connected vacuum bubble diagrams at second order in $\\phi^4$ theory. (Note: Some textbooks may contain confusing illustrations, but a rigorous combinatorial or graph-theoretic analysis confirms there are only two such diagrams).\n\n**2. Calculating the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group. This is the number of permutations of its vertices and propagators that leave the diagram's topology unchanged.\n\n**For Diagram A (Figure-8):**\n-   This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators.\n-   **Vertex symmetry:** The two vertices are indistinguishable. Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of **2**.\n-   **Propagator symmetry:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are also indistinguishable. They can be permuted in $4!$ ways. This gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n-   The total symmetry factor for Diagram A is the product of these factors:\n    $S_A = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n**For Diagram B (Double-Scoop):**\n-   This diagram has two vertices connected by two propagators, and each vertex has a single propagator loop.\n-   **Vertex symmetry:** The two vertices are indistinguishable. We can swap vertex $V_1$ (with its loop) with vertex $V_2$ (with its loop), and the diagram remains the same. This gives a factor of **2**.\n-   **Propagator symmetry:**\n    -   The two propagators connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$ are indistinguishable. We can swap them. This gives a factor of $2! = 2$.\n    -   Each loop is a propagator that starts and ends on the same vertex. A common rule for symmetry factors states that each such loop provides a factor of **2**. Since there are two such loops (one on $V_1$, one on $V_2$), this gives a factor of $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n-   The total symmetry factor for Diagram B is the product of these factors:\n    $S_B = 2 \\times (2!) \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\n**3. Summing the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors of all the diagrams found.\n\n-   Symmetry factor of Diagram A: $S_A = 48$\n-   Symmetry factor of Diagram B: $S_B = 16$\n\nTotal sum = $S_A + S_B = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n***\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Number of Diagrams:** A crucial step is the correct identification of all topologically distinct diagrams. A systematic approach, like the one used above based on classifying line connections, is more reliable than relying on potentially ambiguous illustrations in textbooks. The analysis robustly shows only two diagrams exist.\n2.  **Definition of Symmetry Factor:** The term \"symmetry factor\" can be defined in multiple ways in the literature. Here we use the most common definition: the order of the automorphism group of the diagram graph, which is the number of ways of permuting its internal elements while leaving the graph unchanged.\n3.  **Symmetry of Loops:** A propagator connecting a vertex to itself contributes a factor of 2 to the symmetry factor. This is a standard rule that can be derived from the Wick contractions for such a line.\n4.  **Connectedness:** The question asks for vacuum bubble diagrams, which by convention in this context refers to connected diagrams, as they sum up to form the exponent of the full vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe symmetry factors are $S_A = 48$ and $S_B = 16$.\nThe sum is $48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
