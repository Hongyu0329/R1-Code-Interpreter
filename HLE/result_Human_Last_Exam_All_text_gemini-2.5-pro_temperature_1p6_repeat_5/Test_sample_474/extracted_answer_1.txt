No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to provide a signal to natural predators, which for bumblebees are primarily birds. Avian vision is fundamentally different from human vision; birds are tetrachromats and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas humans are trichromats and cannot. Since bumblebee color patterns often include UV elements invisible to humans, a similarity grouping based on human perception (using standard photos that don't capture UV) would not accurately reflect the perceptual grouping made by the predators. Therefore, the resulting clusters would not represent the true, functional mimicry syndromes.
