    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble and the Hamiltonian\n\nThe grand canonical partition function (Z) is defined as:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu_{chem}\\hat{N})} \\right]$\nwhere:\n*   $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian (describing kinetic and potential energies).\n*   $\\mu_{chem}$ is the chemical potential of the reservoir.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   Tr[...] denotes the trace over the entire Fock space.\n\nThe question specifies a system with \"Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. The most standard and physically consistent interpretation is that the operator in the exponent, the **grand canonical Hamiltonian** ($\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu_{chem}\\hat{N}$), is given as $-\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n\nUnder this interpretation, we are asked to compute:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(-\\mu\\hat{N})} \\right] = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}} \\right]$\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Partition Function as a Path Integral\n\nThe path integral formalism is a standard method to compute such traces. The partition function Z can be expressed as a functional integral over fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ (bosonic complex fields) or $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau), \\psi(\\tau)$ (fermionic Grassmann fields) in imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$.\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] e^{-S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n\nThe action S is given by:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\left[ \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu_{chem}) \\psi_k(\\tau) \\right]$\n\nTo match this to our problem, we compare the operator in the exponent, $\\hat{K} = \\sum_k (\\epsilon_k - \\mu_{chem}) \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$, with the given form $-\\mu\\hat{N} = \\sum_k (-\\mu) \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$. Assuming the intrinsic single-particle energies are zero ($\\epsilon_k=0$), we can identify the chemical potential in the standard formula with the given $\\mu$. So, we set $\\epsilon_k=0$ and $\\mu_{chem}=\\mu$.\n\nThe action for a single mode (dropping the index k) becomes:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\bar{\\psi}(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(\\tau)$\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Path Integral\n\nThe path integral with the above quadratic action is a Gaussian integral. Its evaluation is a standard result in quantum field theory, but the result depends critically on whether the particles are **bosons** or **fermions**. The problem does not specify the particle statistics, so we must consider both cases.\n\nThe evaluation of the Gaussian path integral yields a determinant:\n*   For fermions: $Z_F = \\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$\n*   For bosons: $Z_B = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Determinant\n\nThe determinant is the product of the eigenvalues of the operator. The operator $\\partial_\\tau - \\mu$ is diagonalized by expanding the fields in a Fourier series over Matsubara frequencies, $\\omega_n$. The eigenvalues are $(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\n\n*   **For fermions**, fields are anti-periodic in $\\tau$, so $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$.\n*   **For bosons**, fields are periodic in $\\tau$, so $\\omega_n = 2n\\pi/\\beta$.\n\nThe formal product $\\prod_n(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$ is divergent and requires careful regularization. The standard, regularized result of this calculation, which can be confirmed by various methods (zeta function regularization, contour integration, etc.), is a cornerstone of the thermal field theory formalism. The identity connects the determinant to the result obtained from a direct trace calculation over Fock space.\n\nThe established formulas for the partition function of a single energy level $\\epsilon_k$ are:\n*   For a single fermionic state: $Z_{F,k} = 1 + e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n*   For a single bosonic state: $Z_{B,k} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}}$\n\n### Step 5: Acquire the Final Answer\n\nApplying these formulas to our specific problem where $\\epsilon_k=0$ and we consider a single state (or a system of identical, non-interacting particles where Z is a product of single-state functions):\n\n#### Case 1: The system consists of Fermions\nFor a single fermionic state with energy $\\epsilon=0$ and chemical potential $\\mu$:\n$Z_F = 1 + e^{-\\beta(0 - \\mu)} = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n\n#### Case 2: The system consists of Bosons\nFor a single bosonic state with energy $\\epsilon=0$ and chemical potential $\\mu$:\n$Z_B = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(0 - \\mu)}} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\nThis result is physically meaningful only if the geometric series used in its derivation converges, which requires $|e^{\\beta\\mu}| < 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this implies $\\mu < 0$.\n\n### Summary of careful points:\n1.  **Interpretation of the Hamiltonian:** Clarifying that \"Hamiltonian\" in this context refers to the grand canonical Hamiltonian.\n2.  **Particle Statistics:** Recognizing that the result depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions, as this is not specified.\n3.  **Path Integral Evaluation:** The evaluation of the path integral involves a non-trivial determinant calculation. Instead of re-deriving it from scratch (a process fraught with subtleties related to regularization), we use the well-established final formulas that result from this procedure.\n4.  **Parameter Mapping:** Correctly mapping the given Hamiltonian to the standard formula by setting the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k=0$ and the chemical potential to $\\mu$.\n5.  **Bosonic Condition:** Noting the condition $\\mu<0$ for the bosonic partition function to be well-defined.\n\nThe final answer depends on the unspecified statistics of the particles.\n\nFor a system of **fermions**, the partition function is $Z_F = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$.\nFor a system of **bosons**, the partition function is $Z_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$, with the condition that $\\mu < 0$.\n\n<<<For fermions, Z = 1 + e^(βμ). For bosons, Z = (1 - e^(βμ))⁻¹, provided μ < 0.>>>"
