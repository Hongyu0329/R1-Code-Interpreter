    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions to the ODE, which occur where $x'(t) = 0$. Let's denote the right-hand side as $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFactor out $-x$:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe expression in the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability, we can use the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at the equilibrium points. This is known as the linearization method or the first derivative test for stability.\nFirst, we find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nThe stability criteria are:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method.\n\nLet's test our equilibrium points:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability of $x=1$ using a different method**\n\nWhen the first derivative test is inconclusive, we need to examine the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point.\nOur function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n\n*   **Consider a point slightly to the left of $x=1$** (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$).\n    For $x$ close to 1, the term $-x$ is negative (close to -1). The term $(x-1)^2 = ((1-\\epsilon)-1)^2 = (-\\epsilon)^2 = \\epsilon^2$ is positive.\n    So, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\n    Since $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ will decrease, moving away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **Consider a point slightly to the right of $x=1$** (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$).\n    The term $-x$ is negative. The term $(x-1)^2 = ((1+\\epsilon)-1)^2 = \\epsilon^2$ is positive.\n    So, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\n    Since $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ will decrease, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nAn equilibrium point is considered stable only if trajectories on both sides converge to it. In this case, trajectories from the right of $x=1$ move towards it, but trajectories from the left move away from it. This type of equilibrium is called **semi-stable**. A semi-stable equilibrium is not considered stable.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly identify all equilibrium points by solving $f(x)=0$. Be careful with factorization.\n*   Remember the conditions for stability using the first derivative test ($f'(x^*)$).\n*   Know what to do when the test is inconclusive ($f'(x^*)=0$).\n*   Understand the definition of stability. An equilibrium point must be attractive from both sides to be classified as stable. A semi-stable point is not stable.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, is 1.\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
