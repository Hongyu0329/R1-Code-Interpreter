    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where:\n$f = \\text{atan2}(y,x)$\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$\n$n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis vector field defines a map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the unit sphere $S^2$, since $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = \\sin^2(G)(\\cos^2(f)+\\sin^2(f)) + \\cos^2(G) = \\sin^2(G) + \\cos^2(G) = 1$. The parameters $G$ and $f$ can be interpreted as the polar and azimuthal angles on the target sphere $S^2$, respectively (i.e., $\\theta=G, \\phi=f$).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Field at Infinity\nWe need to check the behavior of the field as the distance from the origin $|\\mathbf{x}| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ goes to infinity.\nAs $|\\mathbf{x}| \\to \\infty$, the term $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$ also goes to infinity.\nConsequently, $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$ approaches 0.\nAs $G \\to 0$:\n*   $\\sin(G) \\to 0$\n*   $\\cos(G) \\to 1$\nSo, the vector field $\\mathbf{n}$ approaches $(0,0,1)$ as $|\\mathbf{x}| \\to \\infty$. This means the field is constant at infinity. This allows us to compactify the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^3$ by adding a \"point at infinity\" which is mapped to $(0,0,1)$. The map can then be treated as a map from $S^3$ to $S^2$.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Hopf Charge\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological integer that classifies maps from $S^3$ to $S^2$. It can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of two regular points on the target sphere $S^2$.\n$Q_H = \\text{Lk}(\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_1), \\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_2))$, where $p_1, p_2 \\in S^2$ are two regular values.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Preimages of Two Points\nLet's choose two convenient points on $S^2$. A good choice is the South Pole, $p_S = (0,0,-1)$, and a point on the equator, for example, $p_E = (1,0,0)$.\n\n**Preimage of the South Pole ($p_S$):**\nWe need to find the points $(x,y,z)$ where $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (0,0,-1)$.\nThis requires $n_z = \\cos(G) = -1$, which means $G = (2k+1)\\pi$ for an integer $k$.\nThe definition of $G$ is $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$. So, we need $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = (2k+1)\\pi$, which simplifies to $\\exp(-10 r_2) = 2k+1$.\nSince $r_2 \\ge 0$, we have $0 < \\exp(-10 r_2) \\le 1$.\nThis inequality restricts $k$ to satisfy $0 < 2k+1 \\le 1$, which gives $-1/2 < k \\le 0$. The only integer solution is $k=0$.\nFor $k=0$, we have $\\exp(-10 r_2) = 1$, which means $-10 r_2 = 0$, so $r_2=0$.\nFrom the definition of $r_2$:\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2} = 0$.\nThis holds if and only if $z=0$ and $x^2+y^2-0.5=0$.\nSo, the preimage of the South Pole is the circle $C_S$ defined by $x^2+y^2 = 0.5$ in the $z=0$ plane.\n\n**Preimage of the Equatorial Point ($p_E$):**\nWe need to find the points $(x,y,z)$ where $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (1,0,0)$.\nThis requires:\n1.  $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2 + k\\pi$.\n2.  $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f) = 1$.\n3.  $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f) = 0$.\n\nFrom condition 1, $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 + k\\pi \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2+k$.\nAgain, using $0 < \\exp(-10 r_2) \\le 1$, we get $0 < 1/2+k \\le 1$, which means $-1/2 < k \\le 1/2$. The only integer solution is $k=0$.\nFor $k=0$, $\\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2$, which gives $-10 r_2 = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$, so $r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\nLet's call this constant $C_r = \\ln(2)/10$. The condition on $G$ defines a surface $(\\rho^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = C_r^2$, where $\\rho^2=x^2+y^2$. This is a torus-like surface of revolution around the z-axis.\n\nNow, from condition 1 with $k=0$, $G=\\pi/2$, so $\\sin(G)=1$.\nConditions 2 and 3 become $\\cos(f)=1$ and $\\sin(f)=0$. This implies $f=2m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\nFrom the definition $f = \\text{atan2}(y,x)$, $f=0$ corresponds to the half-plane where $y=0$ and $x>0$.\nSo, the preimage of the point $(1,0,0)$ is the curve $C_E$ given by the intersection of the surface $(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2=C_r^2$ with the half-plane $y=0, x>0$. This is a single closed loop in the $xz$-plane.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Linking Number\nWe now need to find the linking number of the circle $C_S$ and the loop $C_E$.\n*   $C_S$ is a circle of radius $\\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.707$ in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin.\n*   $C_E$ is a closed loop in the $xz$-plane.\n\nTo find the linking number, we can check how the loop $C_E$ passes through the disk bounded by the circle $C_S$. The disk is the region $x^2+y^2 \\le 0.5, z=0$.\nThe loop $C_E$ lies in the plane $y=0$. It intersects the plane of the disk ($z=0$) at points where its defining equation is satisfied with $z=0$:\n$(x^2-0.5)^2 = C_r^2 \\implies x^2-0.5 = \\pm C_r$.\n$x^2 = 0.5 \\pm C_r$. Since $x>0$, we get two intersection points:\n$x_1 = \\sqrt{0.5 + C_r} = \\sqrt{0.5 + \\ln(2)/10} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5+0.0693} = \\sqrt{0.5693} \\approx 0.754$.\n$x_2 = \\sqrt{0.5 - C_r} = \\sqrt{0.5 - \\ln(2)/10} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5-0.0693} = \\sqrt{0.4307} \\approx 0.656$.\n\nThe radius of circle $C_S$ is $\\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.707$.\nComparing the x-coordinates of the intersection points with the radius:\n*   $x_1 \\approx 0.754 > \\sqrt{0.5}$. This point is outside the circle $C_S$.\n*   $x_2 \\approx 0.656 < \\sqrt{0.5}$. This point is inside the circle $C_S$.\n\nThe loop $C_E$ is a single continuous closed loop. It pierces the plane containing $C_S$ at two points, one inside the circle and one outside. This means the loop must pass through the disk bounded by $C_S$ exactly once.\nTwo closed loops in 3D space that are configured such that one passes through the other have a linking number of $\\pm 1$. The Hopf charge is the absolute value of this integer.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe linking number of the preimages of two regular points is 1. Therefore, the Hopf charge of the given field is 1. The Whitehead integral formula would give the same result if handled carefully, taking into account the singularity of the chosen vector potential along the z-axis. However, the geometric linking number calculation is more direct and less prone to errors in this context.\n\nFinal check: The dependence of the field on the azimuthal angle is through $\\cos(f)$ and $\\sin(f)$. In general, for a field with dependence on $\\cos(Nf)$ and $\\sin(Nf)$, the Hopf charge would be $|N|$. Here, $N=1$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
