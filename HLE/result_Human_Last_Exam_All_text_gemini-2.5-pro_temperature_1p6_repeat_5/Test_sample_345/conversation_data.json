    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key entities in the question:**\n    *   Painting: \"The Radionist\"\n    *   Artist: Kurt Günther\n    *   Year of Creation: 1927\n    *   Medium: Tempera\n    *   Year of Acquisition: 1967\n    *   The goal is to find the acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Initial Research:** A search for the painting \"The Radionist\" (or its original German title, \"Der Radionist\") by Kurt Günther typically leads to information about German art of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) period.\n\n3.  **Locate the Painting's Current Institution:** The painting is widely documented as being a major work in the collection of a specific German museum. This museum is the Lindenau-Museum located in Altenburg, Germany.\n\n4.  **Verify the Acquisition Date:** The most critical part of the question is confirming the acquisition year of 1967. It's not enough to know where the painting is now; we must confirm when it got there. Checking the museum's own collection records or reliable art historical databases (like Bildindex der Kunst und Architektur) provides the provenance, or history of ownership, for the artwork.\n\n5.  **Confirmation:** The Lindenau-Museum Altenburg's records confirm that the painting \"Der Radionist\" by Kurt Günther (Inventory No. G 1326) was acquired for their collection in 1967 from a private owner.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguish between creation and acquisition dates:** The painting was made in 1927, but the question is about its acquisition in 1967. These two dates are distinct and important.\n*   **Verify the source:** Information should be cross-referenced with reliable sources, such as the museum's official website or reputable art databases, to ensure accuracy.\n*   **Use the correct museum name:** The full name of the institution is Lindenau-Museum Altenburg, which clarifies both the name and the location.\n\nBy following these steps and checking the details carefully, we can confidently identify the correct museum.\n\n<<<Lindenau-Museum Altenburg"
