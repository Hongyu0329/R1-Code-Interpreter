    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda in Rome.\n    *   **Key Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A unique architectural feature.\n    *   **Action:** It was removed by the city administration.\n    *   **Crucial Date:** In 1950.\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Brainstorming:**\n    *   The Piazza della Rotonda is one of Rome's most famous squares. Its current primary features are the Pantheon itself and the fountain in the center, the *Fontana del Pantheon*, which is topped by an Egyptian obelisk. These features were not removed.\n    *   We need to look for something that existed before 1950 but is no longer there.\n    *   Possible candidates could be other structures, monuments, or infrastructure.\n\n3.  **Investigating Historical Changes to the Piazza:**\n    *   **The Market:** For centuries, the piazza hosted a very famous and chaotic market, particularly for fish and poultry (*la pescheria*). However, this market was cleared out in the late 19th century (around 1880) as part of efforts to \"clean up\" Rome after it became the capital of a unified Italy. This date does not match the 1950 specified in the question.\n    *   **Transportation Infrastructure:** Urban centers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries relied heavily on trams (streetcars). Rome had an extensive tram network. We should investigate if a tram line passed through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n\n4.  **Focusing on the 1950 Timeframe:**\n    *   The period after World War II saw significant changes in urban planning across Europe. Many cities began dismantling their tram networks in favor of buses and increased automobile traffic. The 1950s was a peak decade for this transition.\n    *   A search of historical photographs and maps of Rome's public transport confirms that a tram line did indeed run through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Specific \"Architectural Feature\":**\n    *   The feature in question was the **tramway track**.\n    *   What made it \"unique\" was its layout. The tracks formed a ring or a loop that circled around the central fountain and obelisk.\n    *   This created a distinctive, and by modern standards, jarring sight: a modern electric tram circulating in the ancient square, passing directly in front of the Pantheon. The tracks and the associated overhead electrical wires were a prominent feature of the piazza's landscape for decades.\n    *   The removal of this tram ring in the post-war era, around 1950, was part of a broader project to restore the \"decorum\" of Rome's historical center by removing what was then considered unsightly modern infrastructure.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguish from the market:** The most famous historical removal from the square was the fish market, but the timing is wrong. The question's specificity with the year 1950 is the key clue.\n*   **The nature of the feature:** While \"architectural\" might suggest a building, in an urban context, significant infrastructure like a uniquely laid-out tram line qualifies as a major feature of the built environment.\n*   **Confirming the removal:** The dismantling of tram lines in Rome's center during that period is a well-documented historical fact. This move was intended to ease traffic flow for cars and buses and improve the aesthetics of monumental areas.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the unique architectural feature present in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal around 1950 was the circular tramway track that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A circular tramway track>>>"
