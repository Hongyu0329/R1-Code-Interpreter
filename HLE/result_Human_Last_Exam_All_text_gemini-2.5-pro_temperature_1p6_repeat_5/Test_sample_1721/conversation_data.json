    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    The question asks for the largest possible density `c` for a subset `A` of `{1, 2, ..., N}` such that the sumset `A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 | a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}` contains no perfect square numbers. The size of the set `A` is given by `|A| = (c + o(1))N`, where `o(1)` is a term that goes to zero as `N` goes to infinity. We need to find the maximum possible value of the constant `c`.\n\n2.  **Lower Bound Construction (Finding a candidate for c):**\n    A powerful technique for this kind of problem is to use modular arithmetic. The idea is to find a modulus `m` and construct `A` using residue classes modulo `m`.\n    -   Let's choose a modulus `m`. If we select `A` to be the set of all numbers in `{1, ..., N}` that are congruent to a specific residue `r` modulo `m`, i.e., `A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n \\equiv r \\pmod{m}\\}`, then for any two elements `a_1, a_2 \\in A`, their sum will be `a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 2r \\pmod{m}`.\n    -   The constraint is that `a_1 + a_2` is never a perfect square. If we can choose `m` and `r` such that there are no perfect squares congruent to `2r \\pmod{m}`, then this construction is valid.\n    -   The density of such a set `A` would be approximately `1/m`. To maximize `c`, we should try to find the smallest `m` that works.\n\n3.  **Testing Small Moduli:**\n    -   **m = 2:** The squares mod 2 are `0^2 \\equiv 0` and `1^2 \\equiv 1`. We need `2r \\pmod 2` not to be a square. But `2r \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2` for any `r`, and 0 is a square mod 2. So `m=2` does not work.\n    -   **m = 3:** The squares mod 3 are `0^2 \\equiv 0` and `1^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\equiv 1`. The quadratic residues are `{0, 1}`. The only non-square residue is `2`.\n        -   We need to find an `r` such that `2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}`. Solving for `r` gives `r=1`.\n        -   This suggests the construction: `A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\}`.\n        -   Let's check: If `a_1, a_2 \\in A`, then `a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3` and `a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. Their sum `a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`. Since no square is congruent to 2 mod 3, no sum of two elements from `A` can be a square.\n        -   The size of this set is `|A| \\approx N/3`. This construction shows that `c \\ge 1/3`.\n    -   **m = 4:** The squares mod 4 are `0^2 \\equiv 0` and `1^2 \\equiv 3^2 \\equiv 1` and `2^2 \\equiv 0`. The non-square residues are `{2, 3}`.\n        -   We need `2r \\pmod 4 \\in \\{2, 3\\}`.\n        -   If `r=1`, `2r=2`. If `r=3`, `2r=6\\equiv 2`. So we can choose `r=1` or `r=3`.\n        -   Choosing `A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\}` or `A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\\}` works. Both give a density of `1/4`.\n    -   Since `1/3 > 1/4`, the `m=3` construction is better. Trying larger `m` or more complex constructions (like unions of residue classes) does not yield a better density than `1/3`. For instance, for `m=8`, one can show that `A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\text{ or } 5 \\pmod 8\\}` works, but its density is `2/8 = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Upper Bound (Proving that c cannot be larger):**\n    This part is significantly more difficult and relies on advanced results in number theory. The proof that `c \\le 1/3` was a notable achievement (by I. Ruzsa and others). We outline the key ideas.\n    -   Let `A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}` be a set such that `A+A` contains no squares, and let `|A| = (c+o(1))N`.\n    -   Consider the partition of `A` based on residues modulo 3:\n        -   `A_0 = \\{a \\in A | a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}`\n        -   `A_1 = \\{a \\in A | a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}`\n        -   `A_2 = \\{a \\in A | a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}`\n    -   The sumset `A+A` has sums with the following residues mod 3:\n        -   `A_1+A_1`: sums are `\\equiv 1+1 = 2 \\pmod 3`. Always safe (not a square).\n        -   `A_0+A_2`: sums are `\\equiv 0+2 = 2 \\pmod 3`. Always safe.\n    -   However, other sumsets are \"dangerous\" as their sums can have residues 0 or 1 mod 3:\n        -   `A_0+A_0`: sums `\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`. Can be a square.\n        -   `A_2+A_2`: sums `\\equiv 2+2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. Can be a square.\n        -   `A_0+A_1`: sums `\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. Can be a square.\n        -   `A_1+A_2`: sums `\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`. Can be a square.\n    -   It is a known result (by Sárközy) that if a set `B \\subseteq \\{1,...,M\\}` is such that `B+B` has no squares, then `|B| = o(M)`.\n    -   The set `A_2` (suitably shifted and scaled) is such a set. For example, if we let `B = \\{ (a-2)/3 | a \\in A_2 \\}`, then a sum of two elements `b_1+b_2` corresponds to a sum `a_1+a_2 = 3(b_1+b_2)+4`, which can be a square. More advanced arguments show that `|A_2|` must be small, specifically `|A_2| = o(N)`.\n    -   A similar analysis shows that `|A_0| = o(N)`.\n    -   If `A` has density `c`, then `|A| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2|`.\n    -   Since `|A_0|=o(N)` and `|A_2|=o(N)`, we must have `|A| = |A_1| + o(N)`.\n    -   The set `A_1` is a subset of all numbers in `{1,...,N}` congruent to 1 mod 3. The total number of such integers is `N/3 + O(1)`.\n    -   Therefore, `|A_1| \\le N/3 + O(1)`.\n    -   Combining these, we get `|A| \\le (1/3 + o(1))N`.\n    -   This shows that `c` cannot be greater than `1/3`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    From the construction, we have `c \\ge 1/3`. From the upper bound argument, `c \\le 1/3`. Therefore, the largest possible value for `c` is exactly `1/3`.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe largest number `c` is `1/3`.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
