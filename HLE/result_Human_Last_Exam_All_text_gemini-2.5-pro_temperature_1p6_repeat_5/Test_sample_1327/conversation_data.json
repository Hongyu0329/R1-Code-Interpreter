    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and look for a simple pattern.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the differences between consecutive terms (first-order differences).**\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no simple arithmetic progression here.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a multiplication-based pattern.**\nLet's see if each term can be derived from the previous one by a formula like `x_n = a * x_{n-1} + b`.\n*   From 2 to 11: 11 is roughly 2 times 5, or 3 times 3, or 4 times 2, etc.\n*   From 11 to 23: 23 is very close to 11 * 2 (which is 22).\n*   From 23 to 51: 51 is close to 23 * 2 (which is 46).\n*   From 51 to 119: 119 is close to 51 * 2 (which is 102).\n\nThis suggests a pattern involving multiplication by 2 or 3. Let's explore the multiplication by 3, as it involves larger adjustments which might reveal a clearer secondary pattern.\n\n**Step 4: Test the hypothesis `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} + c` where `c` is some adjustment value.**\n*   **Term 2 (11):** `3 * x_1` = `3 * 2 = 6`. To get 11, we must add 5. So, `11 = 3 * 2 + 5`.\n*   **Term 3 (23):** `3 * x_2` = `3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we must subtract 10. So, `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`.\n*   **Term 4 (51):** `3 * x_3` = `3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we must subtract 18. So, `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`.\n*   **Term 5 (119):** `3 * x_4` = `3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we must subtract 34. So, `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the sequence of adjustments.**\nThe main rule seems to be `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k_n`.\nThe sequence of subtracted numbers `k` is `{10, 18, 34, ...}`. (Note: The first operation was an addition, which can be written as subtracting -5, but let's focus on the consistent subtraction part first).\nLet's analyze the sequence `k = {10, 18, 34}`.\n\n**Step 6: Find the pattern within the adjustment sequence `k`.**\n*   How to get from 10 to 18? `18 = 10 * 2 - 2`.\n*   How to get from 18 to 34? `34 = 18 * 2 - 2`.\nA clear pattern emerges for the adjustment sequence `k`: the next term is twice the previous term, minus 2.\n`k_n = 2 * k_{n-1} - 2`.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the next adjustment term.**\nThe last adjustment was 34. Following the pattern:\n*   Next adjustment = `2 * 34 - 2` = `68 - 2 = 66`.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the next term in the main sequence.**\nThe last term in the main sequence is 119. We apply the overall rule `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k_n` with the next adjustment term we just found.\n*   Next term = `3 * 119 - 66`\n*   `3 * 119 = 357`\n*   `357 - 66 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291. This matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The first term of the pattern (`11 = 3 * 2 + 5`) is an exception to the `3x - k` rule. This is common in complex sequences where the pattern establishes itself after the first step.\n2.  It is important to test multiple hypotheses (e.g., arithmetic difference, `2x+k`, `3x-k`) rather than getting stuck on the first one that seems plausible but doesn't lead to a final answer.\n3.  The solution involves a \"nested\" pattern: a primary pattern for the main sequence which relies on a secondary sequence (the adjustments), which has its own clear pattern.\n\nFinal calculation:\n- `x_2 = 3*x_1 + 5 = 3*2 + 5 = 11`\n- `x_3 = 3*x_2 - 10 = 3*11 - 10 = 23`\n- `x_4 = 3*x_3 - 18 = 3*23 - 18 = 51`, where `18 = 2*10 - 2`\n- `x_5 = 3*x_4 - 34 = 3*51 - 34 = 119`, where `34 = 2*18 - 2`\n- `x_6 = 3*x_5 - k`, where `k = 2*34 - 2 = 66`\n- `x_6 = 3*119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`\n\n<<<A>>>"
