    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The question asks for the smallest possible size, `n`, of a set `G` for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that the algebraic structure `(G, ·)` is *not* a group.\n\n2.  **Definition of a Group:** A structure `(G, ·)` is called a group if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** For all elements `a`, `b` in `G`, the result of the operation `a · b` is also in `G`. (The question statement guarantees this by specifying `·` is a binary operation **on G**).\n    *   **Associativity:** For all `a`, `b`, `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` (the inverse of `a`) in `G` such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\n    For `(G, ·)` to *not* be a group, it must fail to satisfy at least one of the Associativity, Identity, or Inverse axioms.\n\n3.  **Exploring Possible Values of `n`:** The size of a set, `n`, must be a non-negative integer (`n = 0, 1, 2, ...`). We will test the smallest values in order.\n\n4.  **Case: n = 0**\n    *   The set is the empty set, `G = {}`.\n    *   A binary operation `·` on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, `G × G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set (the empty function), so a binary operation can be defined.\n    *   Let's check the group axioms:\n        *   **Closure:** True (vacuously, as there are no elements to test).\n        *   **Associativity:** True (vacuously, for the same reason).\n        *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires the *existence* of an element `e` in `G`. Since `G` is empty, no such element exists. Therefore, this axiom fails.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=0:** The structure `({}, ·)` is not a group. So, `n=0` is a potential answer.\n\n5.  **A Careful Point on Convention:** While `n=0` is a technically correct answer based on a literal reading of the definitions, the vast majority of mathematical literature and coursework (especially in abstract algebra) implicitly or explicitly defines a group on a **non-empty** set. The axiom for the identity element is often stated as \"G contains an identity element e...\", which presupposes `G` is not empty. Assuming the question follows this standard convention, we should search for the smallest *positive* integer `n`.\n\n6.  **Case: n = 1**\n    *   The set has one element, `G = {a}`.\n    *   For the closure property to hold, the binary operation must map `(a, a)` to an element in `G`. The only option is `a · a = a`.\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for `(G, ·)` where `a · a = a`:\n        *   **Closure:** Holds by definition of the operation.\n        *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a` must equal `a · (a · a)`. The left side is `a · a = a`. The right side is `a · a = a`. It is associative.\n        *   **Identity Element:** The element `a` acts as the identity, since `a · a = a`.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** The identity element is `e = a`. For the element `a`, its inverse `a⁻¹` must satisfy `a · a⁻¹ = a`. The only choice for `a⁻¹` is `a`, and it works since `a · a = a`.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** Any set of size 1 with a binary operation is always a group (the trivial group). Thus, `n=1` is not the answer.\n\n7.  **Case: n = 2**\n    *   The set has two elements, `G = {a, b}`.\n    *   We need to determine if we can define a binary operation `·` that fails at least one group axiom. Let's try to construct one.\n    *   Consider the following operation defined by its Cayley table:\n        ```\n          · | a | b\n          --|---|--\n          a | a | b\n          b | a | b\n        ```\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for this structure:\n        *   **Closure:** All results (`a` and `b`) are in `G`, so it holds.\n        *   **Associativity:** Let's test a case:\n            `(b · a) · b = a · b = b`\n            `b · (a · b) = b · b = b`\n            This specific case works. However, let's test another one.\n            `(a · b) · a = b · a = a`\n            `a · (b · a) = a · a = a`\n            This structure is actually associative.\n        *   **Identity Element:** Is there an identity `e`?\n            - If `e=a`: we need `a · b = b` and `b · a = b`. The second fails (`b · a = a`).\n            - If `e=b`: we need `b · a = a` and `a · b = a`. The second fails (`a · b = b`).\n            There is no identity element.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=2:** Since the identity axiom fails, this structure is not a group. We have found an example of a set of size 2 that can be equipped with a binary operation to form a non-group.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We are looking for the *smallest* number `n`.\n    *   If we allow `n=0`, the answer is 0.\n    *   If we follow the standard mathematical convention that groups are non-empty, we are looking for the smallest positive integer.\n    *   We found that `n=1` must always form a group.\n    *   We found that for `n=2`, it is possible to construct a structure that is not a group.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest positive integer `n` is 2. In the context of typical mathematics questions, this is the expected answer.\n\n<<<2>>>"
