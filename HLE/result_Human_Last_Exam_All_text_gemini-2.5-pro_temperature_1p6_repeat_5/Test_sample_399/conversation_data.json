    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of differential equation**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)\n$$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1) \\cdot x^2\n$$\nThis is a first-order non-linear ordinary differential equation. We can see that it is separable because we can write it in the form $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t)g(x)$, where $f(t) = t-1$ and $g(x) = x^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the variables**\n\nTo solve a separable equation, we move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt\n$$\n**Careful point:** This step involves dividing by $x^2$. This is only valid if $x \\neq 0$. We should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution to the original equation. Plugging $x(t)=0$ gives $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the particular solution we are looking for is not the zero solution, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\n**Step 3: Integrate both sides**\n\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nLet's compute each integral:\n-   The left side: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n-   The right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nAfter integration, we must add a constant of integration, which we will denote by $C$. It is sufficient to add it to one side.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\n\nThe initial condition is given as $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation to find the value of $C$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\nSo, the constant of integration is $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the particular solution and evaluate at t=1**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the value of $x(1)$. To do this, we substitute $t=1$ into this equation.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo simplify the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, to find $x(1)$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is obtained by substituting $t=1$ into the particular solution of the initial value problem.\n\n<<<$8/3$>>>"
