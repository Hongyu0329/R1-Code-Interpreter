    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for the specified calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular System**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** The notation $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ indicates a molecule containing one Carbon atom (C), one Silicon atom (Si), one Fluorine atom (F), and three Hydrogen atoms (H) in total (two attached to Carbon, one elsewhere, likely on Silicon, e.g., in fluorosilylethene $\\mathrm{H_2C=Si(H)F}$).\n2.  **Total Number of Electrons ($N_{elec}$):** We sum the electrons from each atom based on their atomic number.\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom $\\times$ 3 atoms = 3 electrons\n    *   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n    *   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n    *   Total electrons $N = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$ electrons.\n3.  **Total Spin (S):** The molecule has an even number of electrons (32). For a stable, closed-shell molecule, the ground state is a singlet state. Therefore, the total spin $S = 0$.\n4.  **Electron Partition:** For a singlet state ($S=0$) in a calculation for the $M_S=0$ component, the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_\\alpha$) equals the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n    *   $N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Number of Basis Functions (Spatial Orbitals)**\n\n1.  **Basis Set:** The calculation uses the 6-31G** basis set. This is equivalent to 6-31G(d,p). The first asterisk (*) indicates that a set of d-type polarization functions is added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. The second asterisk (**) indicates that a set of p-type polarization functions is added to hydrogen atoms. We assume the standard use of 5 spherical d-functions and 3 p-functions.\n2.  **Number of Basis Functions per Atom ($N_{bf}$):**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G basis provides 2s functions. The '**' adds one set of p-functions (3 orbitals).\n        *   $N_{bf}(\\text{H}) = 2\\text{(s)} + 3\\text{(p)} = 5$.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** As a second-row heavy atom, 6-31G provides 3s and 2p functions (total 9 functions). The '*' adds one set of d-functions (5 orbitals).\n        *   $N_{bf}(\\text{C}) = 9 + 5\\text{(d)} = 14$.\n    *   **Silicon (Si):** As a third-row heavy atom, 6-31G provides 4s and 3p functions (total 13 functions). The '*' adds one set of d-functions (5 orbitals).\n        *   $N_{bf}(\\text{Si}) = 13 + 5\\text{(d)} = 18$.\n    *   **Fluorine (F):** As a second-row heavy atom, it's treated like Carbon.\n        *   $N_{bf}(\\text{F}) = 9 + 5\\text{(d)} = 14$.\n3.  **Total Number of Basis Functions (K):** We sum the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   $K = N_{bf}(\\text{C}) + 3 \\times N_{bf}(\\text{H}) + N_{bf}(\\text{Si}) + N_{bf}(\\text{F})$\n    *   $K = 14 + 3 \\times 5 + 18 + 14$\n    *   $K = 14 + 15 + 18 + 14 = 61$.\n    *   So, there are $K=61$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs)**\n\n1.  **Full CI Calculation:** A Full CI calculation considers all possible ways to distribute the $N$ electrons among the $K$ spatial orbitals, consistent with the specified total spin $S$.\n2.  **Formula for Number of CSFs:** The number of CSFs for a system with $N$ electrons, $K$ spatial orbitals, and total spin $S$ is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n    $N_{CSF}(K, N, S) = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2-S} \\binom{K+1}{N/2+S+1}$\n3.  **Substitute Values:** We substitute our determined parameters into this formula:\n    *   $K = 61$\n    *   $N = 32$\n    *   $S = 0$\n    *   $2S+1 = 1$\n    *   $K+1 = 62$\n    *   $N/2 - S = 32/2 - 0 = 16$\n    *   $N/2 + S + 1 = 32/2 + 0 + 1 = 17$\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{62} \\binom{62}{16} \\binom{62}{17}$\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Number:** The values of the binomial coefficients are very large, requiring a calculator or computational software.\n    *   $\\binom{62}{16} = \\frac{62!}{16! \\cdot (62-16)!} = \\frac{62!}{16! \\cdot 46!} = 600,373,218,764,355$\n    *   $\\binom{62}{17} = \\frac{62!}{17! \\cdot (62-17)!} = \\frac{62!}{17! \\cdot 45!} = 4,593,809,228,811,800$\n\n    Now, we compute the final result:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{62} \\times (600,373,218,764,355) \\times (4,593,809,228,811,800)$\n    $N_{CSF} = \\frac{2,758,000,399,813,136,514,434,994,900}{62}$\n    $N_{CSF} = 44,483,877,416,340,911,523,145,079$\n\nThe number of CSFs is a 26-digit integer."
