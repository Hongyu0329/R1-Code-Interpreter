    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n    *   We need to find the maximum length of a message that can be encoded using the symbols in the book *Ching*.\n    *   This is an information theory problem. The core idea is that the total information capacity of the encoding medium (the *Ching*) must be at least as large as the total information content of the message.\n    *   **Information in the *Ching* (The Encoding Medium):**\n        *   Length of the *Ching*: 9999 symbols.\n        *   Alphabet of the *Ching*: \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbols.\n    *   **Information in the Message (The Encoded Data):**\n        *   Alphabet of the Message: 120 common Chinese characters from the *Shu*.\n        *   Length of the Message: This is what we need to find (let's call it `L_max`).\n    *   **Irrelevant Information (Distractors):**\n        *   The length of the *Shu* (\"around 3000 characters\") is not important; only the size of its alphabet (120) matters.\n        *   All information about computation time (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) is irrelevant to calculating the information capacity and message length.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Information Capacity of the *Ching***\n    *   First, we determine the number of unique symbols in the *Ching*'s alphabet.\n        *   \"yinyang\" has 2 states (yin, yang).\n        *   \"wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has 5 states (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n        *   Total unique symbols = 2 * 5 = 10 symbols.\n    *   The amount of information conveyed by one symbol is calculated using the formula `log₂(N)`, where N is the number of possible states.\n        *   Information per symbol in the *Ching* = `log₂(10)` bits.\n    *   The total information capacity of the *Ching* is the information per symbol multiplied by the total number of symbols.\n        *   Total Information in *Ching* = `9999 * log₂(10)` bits.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Information Content per Character of the Message**\n    *   The message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique characters.\n    *   The amount of information required to represent one character from this set is:\n        *   Information per message character = `log₂(120)` bits.\n\n4.  **Set up the Equation to Find the Maximum Message Length**\n    *   The total information in the message cannot exceed the total information capacity of the *Ching*.\n    *   Let `L` be the length of the message. The total information in the message is `L * log₂(120)`.\n    *   We can set up the following inequality:\n        `L * log₂(120) ≤ 9999 * log₂(10)`\n    *   To find the maximum length (`L_max`), we solve for `L`:\n        `L ≤ (9999 * log₂(10)) / log₂(120)`\n\n5.  **Solve the Equation**\n    *   We can use the change of base formula for logarithms (`logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)`) to simplify the calculation. The `log₂` terms cancel out.\n        `L ≤ 9999 * (log(10) / log(120))`  (where `log` can be any base, like base 10 or natural log)\n    *   Let's use base 10 logarithm (`log₁₀`):\n        `log₁₀(10) = 1`\n        `log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918`\n    *   Now, substitute these values back into the inequality:\n        `L ≤ 9999 * (1 / 2.07918)`\n        `L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918`\n        `L ≤ 4808.68...`\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    *   The length of the message must be a whole number of characters; you cannot have a fraction of a character.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible length is the largest integer that is less than or equal to 4808.68...\n    *   This is found by taking the floor of the calculated value.\n        `L_max = floor(4808.68...) = 4808`\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Identify the correct problem type:** This is an information capacity problem, not a computation speed problem.\n*   **Filter out irrelevant data:** Ignore the details about processing times and the total length of the *Shu*.\n*   **Correctly determine alphabet sizes:** The *Ching* has an alphabet of 10 symbols (2 × 5), and the message has an alphabet of 120 characters.\n*   **Use the right formula:** The total information is `Length × log₂(Alphabet Size)`.\n*   **Interpret the final number:** Since the message length must be an integer, the final answer must be the floor of the calculated decimal value.\n\n<<<4808>>>"
