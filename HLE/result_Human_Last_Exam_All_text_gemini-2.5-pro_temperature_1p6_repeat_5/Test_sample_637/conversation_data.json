    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to design a full-order observer for the given discrete-time system. The observer's estimate should converge to the true state in the shortest possible time. This is known as a deadbeat observer. The error, e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k), should become identically zero after a minimal number of steps, say N.\n\n**2. Observer Dynamics**\nThe observer dynamics are given by:\nx_hat(k + 1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - y_hat(k))\nwhere y_hat(k) = C*x_hat(k).\n\nThe error dynamics are derived as:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC) * e(k)\n\nFor the error to be identically zero after N steps, regardless of the initial error e(0), the condition is:\n(A - LC)^N = 0\nwhere N is the smallest possible integer. This integer N is the observability index, `nu`, of the pair (A, C). A matrix that satisfies M^N = 0 for some integer N is called a nilpotent matrix. The eigenvalues of a nilpotent matrix are all zero.\n\n**3. Check Observability and Determine the Shortest Time (Observability Index)**\nFirst, we must confirm the system is observable. An LTI system is observable if and only if the observability matrix O has full rank (rank n, where n is the dimension of the state vector).\nn = 4 (state dimension)\np = 2 (output dimension)\nThe observability matrix is O = [C^T, (CA)^T, (CA^2)^T, (CA^3)^T]^T.\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\nC = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\nWe compute the necessary sub-matrices:\nCA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]\nCA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, 0, -3]]\nCA^3 = [[-2, 1, -1, 1], [3, 1, -2, 3]]\nBy constructing a 4x4 matrix from linearly independent rows of O, for example using c1, c2, c2*A, and c2*A^2 (where c1 and c2 are rows of C), we can verify that the rank is 4. The system is observable.\n\nThe shortest possible number of steps for the error to converge to zero is the observability index `nu`. For a MIMO system, this is the maximum of the individual observability indices {nu_1, ..., nu_p}.\nThrough a detailed analysis (checking for linear dependencies row by row), we find:\n- The first row of C, c1, contributes one vector to the basis. Its successor vectors c1*A, c1*A^2... are linearly dependent on previous basis vectors. Thus, nu_1 = 1.\n- The second row of C, c2, contributes vectors up to c2*A^2 to complete the basis of R^4. Thus, nu_2 = 3.\nThe observability index is `nu` = max(1, 3) = 3.\nSo, the shortest possible number of steps is 3. We need to find an observer gain L such that (A - LC)^3 = 0.\n\n**4. Design the Observer Gain Matrix L**\nWe need to choose the 4x2 gain matrix L such that the resulting closed-loop observer matrix A_o = A - LC is nilpotent of index 3 (i.e., A_o^3 = 0 and A_o^2 != 0).\nA standard method to ensure nilpotency is to place all eigenvalues of A_o at the origin. This makes its characteristic polynomial equal to z^4 = 0. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, this guarantees A_o^4 = 0. We need to select L more carefully to achieve the stronger condition A_o^3 = 0.\n\nLet's solve for L directly by specifying a desired structure for A_o = A - LC that is nilpotent of index 3.\nLet the target matrix be A_o_target = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]].\nThis matrix has a characteristic polynomial of z^4 and one can verify that (A_o_target)^3 = 0 while (A_o_target)^2 != 0.\n\nWe now solve the equation A_o_target = A - LC for L.\nLC = A - A_o_target\n\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n     [1, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 1, 0, -1],\n     [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\n\nA_o_target = [[0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [1, 1, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 1, 0]]\n\nLC = [[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n      [1, 0, 0, 2],\n      [-1, 0, 0, -1],\n      [-1, 0, 0, -1]]\n\nWe need to find L = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]] such that:\nL * C = LC\n[[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] =\n[[l11+l12, 0, 0, l12],\n [l21+l22, 0, 0, l22],\n [l31+l32, 0, 0, l32],\n [l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]]\n\nBy comparing this with the computed LC matrix element-wise:\n- Row 1: l11+l12 = -1, l12 = 1  =>  l11 = -2\n- Row 2: l21+l22 = 1, l22 = 2   =>  l21 = -1\n- Row 3: l31+l32 = -1, l32 = -1 =>  l31 = 0\n- Row 4: l41+l42 = -1, l42 = -1 =>  l41 = 0\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe resulting observer gain matrix L is:\nL = [[-2, 1],\n     [-1, 2],\n     [0, -1],\n     [0, -1]]\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
