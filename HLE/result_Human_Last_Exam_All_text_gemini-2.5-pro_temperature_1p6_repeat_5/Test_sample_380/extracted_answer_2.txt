The local magnetic field at the L1 point is **not** considered radial when calculating the normalized magnetic helicity. This is a crucial point and your intuition is correct. Here is the justification for why a coordinate system based on the radial direction is often used despite this fact.

1.  **The Actual Magnetic Field at L1:** The Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) at L1 (1 AU) is not radial. Due to the Sun's rotation, the field lines form a spiral known as the **Parker Spiral**. At Earth's orbit, the angle between the local magnetic field and the Sun-Earth (radial) line is typically around 45 degrees. Therefore, the physical basis for assuming a radial field does not exist.

2.  **The Correct Physical Framework:** As you rightly suggest, for analyzing waves that propagate along the magnetic field, like Alfvén Ion Cyclotron (AIC) waves, the physically correct method is to use a **Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC)** system. In this system, one axis is aligned with the local average magnetic field ($\mathbf{B}_0$), and the wave's polarization and helicity are analyzed in the plane perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}_0$.

3.  **Justification for Using a Radial-Based System:** The reason for using components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., the Y and Z components in a GSE coordinate system, where X is radial) stems from a practical limitation of single-spacecraft measurements and the application of **Taylor's "Frozen-in Flow" Hypothesis**.
    *   **Data Acquisition:** A single spacecraft measures a time series of the magnetic field at one point.
    *   **Taylor's Hypothesis:** The solar wind flows past the spacecraft at a speed ($V_{sw}$) that is much greater than the wave's own propagation speed (it is "super-Alfvénic"). This hypothesis allows scientists to approximate the time series as a one-dimensional spatial scan of the plasma structures as they are swept past the spacecraft.
    *   **Sampling Direction:** The solar wind velocity ($\mathbf{V}_{sw}$) is overwhelmingly in the radial direction. Therefore, under Taylor's Hypothesis, the spacecraft is effectively sampling the plasma along the radial direction.
    *   **Implication for Helicity Calculation:** When the time series is converted to a spatial series, it represents a cut along the radial (X) axis. The subsequent Fourier analysis provides wave properties as a function of the wavenumber in this radial direction, $k_x$. The formula for normalized magnetic helicity, $\sigma_m \propto \text{Im}[B_y^*(k_x) B_z(k_x)]$, is the appropriate one for calculating helicity in the plane perpendicular to this specific sampling direction ($X$-axis).

In summary, the choice to use components perpendicular to the radial direction is not based on a physical assumption that the magnetic field is radial. Instead, it is a direct consequence of the **method of data analysis (Taylor's Hypothesis)**, which imposes the radial direction as th
