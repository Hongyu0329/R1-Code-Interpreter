    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined by $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = b \\sin(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The parameter `b` depends on the value of `t`. We need to analyze the curve in two separate intervals.\n\n2.  **Part 1: $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    In this interval, $b=1$. The parametric equations are:\n    *   $x = \\cos(t)$\n    *   $y = \\sin(t)$\n    This is the standard parameterization of a unit circle ($x^2 + y^2 = 1$).\n    *   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $x = \\cos(t)$ goes from $1$ to $-1$.\n    *   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $y = \\sin(t)$ is non-negative, going from $0$ up to $1$ (at $t=\\pi/2$) and back down to $0$.\n    *   This part of the curve traces the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, from point $(1,0)$ to $(-1,0)$.\n    *   For this part, the range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-values is $[0, 1]$.\n\n3.  **Part 2: $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    In this interval, $b=5$. The parametric equations are:\n    *   $x = \\cos(t)$\n    *   $y = 5\\sin(t)$\n    These equations satisfy $\\frac{x^2}{1^2} + \\frac{y^2}{5^2} = \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$, which is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n    *   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $x = \\cos(t)$ goes from $-1$ to $1$.\n    *   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $y = 5\\sin(t)$ is negative, going from $0$ down to $-5$ (at $t=3\\pi/2$) and back up to $0$.\n    *   This part of the curve traces the lower semi-ellipse, from point $(-1,0)$ to $(1,0)$.\n    *   For this part, the range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y-values is $[-5, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that contains the figure, we first need to find the overall extent of the figure in the x and y directions. This is defined by the minimum and maximum x and y values over the entire range $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n    *   **x-range:** Combining both parts, the minimum value of $x$ is $-1$ and the maximum value is $1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n    *   **y-range:** The maximum value of $y$ is $1$ (from the first part). The minimum value of $y$ is $-5$ (from the second part). So, $y \\in [-5, 1]$.\n\n5.  **Find the Dimensions of the Bounding Rectangle:**\n    The figure is contained within a rectangle defined by its minimum and maximum coordinates.\n    *   Width of the figure = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   Height of the figure = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n6.  **Find the Smallest Circumscribing Square:**\n    The problem asks for the smallest square that \"outcircles\" (circumscribes) the figure. This square must be large enough to contain the bounding rectangle we found in the previous step.\n    *   A rectangle with dimensions width=2 and height=6 can be enclosed in a square.\n    *   The side length of the smallest possible square must be at least as large as the larger dimension of the rectangle.\n    *   Side length of the square, $s = \\max(\\text{Width, Height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Area of the Square:**\n    The area of a square with side length $s$ is $A = s^2$.\n    *   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The parameter `b` is not constant, so the curve is not a simple ellipse. It's a compound curve made of two different parts.\n*   \"Outcircles\" is interpreted as \"circumscribes\" or \"encloses\".\n*   The smallest square containing a non-square rectangle will have a side length equal to the longer side of the rectangle.\n*   The full range for $t$ must be considered to find the overall bounds of the figure. The minimum y-value comes from the second part of the definition, and the maximum y-value comes from the first part.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\n- The horizontal extent of the figure is from $x=-1$ to $x=1$, giving a width of 2.\n- The vertical extent of the figure is from $y=-5$ to $y=1$, giving a height of 6.\n- The side of the smallest square containing this figure must be equal to the larger dimension, which is 6.\n- The area of this square is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
