    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Word and its Reading**\nThe word is 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto). This word refers to one's own younger brother.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Morae Count**\nTo analyze the pitch accent, we need to count the morae (the basic rhythmic units of Japanese).\nThe reading 「おとうと」 is broken down into four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - this 'u' serves to lengthen the 'o' sound of the preceding 'to', forming a long vowel sound 'tō'.\n4.  と (to)\nSo, 「おとうと」 has 4 morae.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Main Pitch Accent Patterns**\nJapanese pitch accent is based on a fall in pitch. The location of this fall determines the pattern.\n\n*   **Heiban (平板式):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high through the rest of the word. A particle that follows the word also remains high. There is no pitch drop. Represented by [0].\n    *   Example: さかな [0] (fish) -> さ(L)か(H)な(H)が(H)\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高式):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae, including the following particle. The pitch fall occurs after the first mora. Represented by [1].\n    *   Example: いのち [1] (life) -> い(H)の(L)ち(L)が(L)\n*   **Nakadaka (中高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and falls on a subsequent mora *within* the word. The particle that follows is low. The number [n] represents the mora after which the pitch drops, where 'n' is not 1 or the last mora.\n    *   Example: くすり [2] (medicine) -> く(L)す(H)り(L)が(L) (The drop is after the 2nd mora, す)\n*   **Odaka (尾高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora. The pitch then falls on the following particle. The number [n] represents the last mora of the word.\n    *   Example: おとこ [3] (man) -> お(L)と(H)こ(H)が(L) (The drop is after the 3rd mora, こ)\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Standard Pitch Accent for 「弟」 (おとうと)**\nConsulting a standard Japanese pitch accent dictionary (like the NHK Japanese Pronunciation Accent Dictionary or OJAD), we find the pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is marked as [0].\n\n*   The [0] notation signifies the **Heiban (平板式)** pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Heiban Pattern to 「おとうと」**\nFollowing the Heiban rule for a 4-mora word:\n*   The first mora 「お」 is low (L).\n*   The second mora 「と」 is high (H).\n*   The third mora 「う」 remains high (H).\n*   The fourth mora 「と」 remains high (H).\n*   A following particle, like 「が」, will also be high (H).\n\nThe resulting pitch contour is: **お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(H)**. This is a classic Heiban pattern.\n\n**Step 6: Match the Finding with the Answer Choices**\n*   A. Heiban: This matches our analysis.\n*   B. Atamadaka: This would be お(H)とうと(L). Incorrect.\n*   C. Nakadaka: This would mean the pitch drops within the word (e.g., お(L)と(H)う(L)と(L)). Incorrect.\n*   D. Odaka: This would mean the pitch is high until the end of the word, then drops on the particle (お(L)とうと(H)が(L)). Incorrect.\n*   E. Heiban or Nakadaka: While some words have multiple accents, the single, overwhelmingly standard accent for 「弟」 is Heiban. Therefore, A is the most precise and correct answer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
