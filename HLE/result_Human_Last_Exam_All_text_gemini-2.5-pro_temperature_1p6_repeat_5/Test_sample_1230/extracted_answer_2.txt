The first thing Charles needs to adjust is his diet. The current diet, which "limits animal protein, fat, and carbohydrates," is overly restrictive and unsustainable. Limiting all three macronutrients at once would lead to extremely low energy levels, intense hunger, and difficulty functioning, which explains why he is struggling. He should adjust his diet to be more balanced, ensuring he receives adequate protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates for energy while maintaining a moderate and sustainable calorie deficit for weight loss.
