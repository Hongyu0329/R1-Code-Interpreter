    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs) in a basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atom being described. The notation `6-311G**` is a Pople-style basis set, and its composition varies for hydrogen atoms versus \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. We will analyze it for both cases, using a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen) as a representative example.\n\n#### **1. Decoding the Basis Set Notation: 6-311G****\n\n*   **`6-311G`**: This part describes the core and valence atomic orbitals using contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are fixed linear combinations of PGFs.\n    *   It is a **split-valence** basis set, meaning core and valence electrons are treated differently.\n    *   It is a **triple-zeta** valence basis, as indicated by the three numbers after the hyphen (`311`). The valence orbitals are represented by three separate basis functions.\n*   **`**` (double star)**: This indicates the addition of **polarization functions**, which allow for more flexibility in describing the shape of orbitals in a molecule.\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of d-type polarization functions to heavy atoms.\n    *   The second `*` adds one set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n    *   This notation is equivalent to `6-311G(d,p)`.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Analysis for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)**\n\nA second-row heavy atom (like C, N, O, F) has a `1s` core orbital and `2s, 2p` valence orbitals.\n\n1.  **Core Orbitals (`1s`)**:\n    *   The `6-` indicates that the core orbital is described by a single CGF.\n    *   This CGF is composed of **6** PGFs.\n    *   **Contribution: 6 PGFs**\n\n2.  **Valence Orbitals (`2s`, `2p`)**:\n    *   The `-311` means the valence shell is described by three functions for each atomic orbital type (s and p).\n    *   **Inner Valence (`-3`):** The first CGF for the s-orbital is made of 3 s-type PGFs. The first CGF for the p-orbitals is made of 3 p-type PGFs. In Pople basis sets, these often share exponents (`sp` contraction).\n        *   Contribution: 3 (s-type PGFs) + 3 (p-type PGFs) = **6 PGFs**\n    *   **Middle Valence (first `-1`):** The second basis function is uncontracted, meaning it is a single PGF. This applies to both s and p orbitals.\n        *   Contribution: 1 (s-type PGF) + 1 (p-type PGF) = **2 PGFs**\n    *   **Outer Valence (second `-1`):** The third basis function is also uncontracted.\n        *   Contribution: 1 (s-type PGF) + 1 (p-type PGF) = **2 PGFs**\n\n3.  **Polarization Functions (`*`)**:\n    *   The first `*` adds a single set of d-type polarization functions.\n    *   For Pople basis sets, this is a set of 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$). These are uncontracted.\n    *   **Contribution: 6 PGFs**\n    *   The second `*` applies only to Hydrogen and has no effect on the heavy atom.\n\n4.  **Total for a Second-Row Heavy Atom**:\n    *   Summing all contributions: 6 (core) + 6 (inner valence) + 2 (middle valence) + 2 (outer valence) + 6 (d-polarization) = **22 PGFs**.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Analysis for a Hydrogen Atom**\n\nA hydrogen atom has no core electrons, only a `1s` valence orbital.\n\n1.  **Valence Orbital (`1s`)**:\n    *   The `6-` prefix does not apply as there is no core. The notation `6-311G` for hydrogen means the 1s orbital is represented by three basis functions, with contractions defined by `3`, `1`, and `1`.\n    *   **Inner function (`3`):** A CGF composed of **3** PGFs.\n    *   **Middle function (`1`):** An uncontracted PGF. **1** PGF.\n    *   **Outer function (`1`):** An uncontracted PGF. **1** PGF.\n    *   **Contribution: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs**\n\n2.  **Polarization Functions (`**`)**:\n    *   The second `*` adds a single set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen.\n    *   A set of p-functions consists of 3 Cartesian functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$). These are uncontracted.\n    *   **Contribution: 3 PGFs**\n\n3.  **Total for a Hydrogen Atom**:\n    *   Summing all contributions: 5 (s-functions) + 3 (p-functions) = **8 PGFs**.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n*   The number of primitives is atom-dependent. A single number cannot describe the entire basis set.\n*   The notation `6-` describes the core orbitals of heavy atoms only.\n*   The notation `-311` describes a triple-zeta split of the valence orbitals.\n*   The notation `**` is equivalent to `(d,p)`, meaning d-functions on heavy atoms and p-functions on hydrogens.\n*   The polarization functions added by `*` in Pople basis sets are typically single, uncontracted Gaussians.\n*   A set of d-functions consists of 6 Cartesian primitives, and a set of p-functions consists of 3 Cartesian primitives.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussian functions in the 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom.\n*   For each **Hydrogen atom**, there are **8** primitive Gaussians.\n*   For each **second-row heavy atom** (e.g., C, N, O, F), there are **22** primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<For the 6-311G** basis set, the number of primitive Gaussian functions per atom is 8 for a Hydrogen atom and 22 for a second-row heavy atom (e.g., C, N, O).>>>"
