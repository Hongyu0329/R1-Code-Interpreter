    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and the corresponding protein sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core of the problem\nThe key information provided is that the nucleotide sequence comes from the \"middle of an ORF\" (Open Reading Frame). An ORF is a continuous sequence of codons that codes for a protein. A critical feature of an ORF is that it does not contain any stop codons (codons that signal the end of translation) within its sequence, except for one at the very end. Since this is the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame will be the one that does not produce any stop codons. The three stop codons in DNA are **TAA**, **TAG**, and **TGA**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the three possible reading frames\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different \"frames\" on the forward strand, depending on which nucleotide you start with. We will test each frame.\n\n**The sequence:**\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n**Frame 1 Analysis:**\nWe start at the 1st nucleotide and group the sequence into codons of three.\n- Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`\n- We immediately find the codon `tag` which is a **stop codon**.\n- **Conclusion:** Frame 1 cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n**Frame 3 Analysis:**\nWe start at the 3rd nucleotide (ignoring the first two, `gg`) and group the sequence into codons of three.\n- Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`\n- We find the codon `tga`, which is a **stop codon**.\n- **Conclusion:** Frame 3 cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n**Frame 2 Analysis:**\nWe start at the 2nd nucleotide (ignoring the first one, `g`) and group the sequence into codons of three.\n- Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag...`\n- A quick scan shows no `taa`, `tag`, or `tga` codons.\n- **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is the only frame without an internal stop codon, so it must be the correct Open Reading Frame.\n\n### Step 3: Translate the sequence in Frame 2\nNow we translate the complete sequence of codons from Frame 2 into the one-letter amino acid code. The sequence has 105 nucleotides. For frame 2, we use nucleotides 2 through 104, which gives 34 complete codons, leaving two nucleotides at the end as a remainder.\n\n- `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n- `att` -> **I** (Isoleucine)\n- `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n- `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n- `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n- `gaa` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n- `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n- `ttg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n- `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n- `gga` -> **G** (Glycine)\n- `acg` -> **T** (Threonine)\n- `gtg` -> **V** (Valine)\n- `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n- `ttt` -> **F** (Phenylalanine)\n- `tca` -> **S** (Serine)\n- `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n- `tct` -> **S** (Serine)\n- `tta` -> **L** (Leucine)\n- `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n- `tac` -> **Y** (Tyrosine)\n- `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n- `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n- `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n- `ctt` -> **L** (Leucine)\n- `aac` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n- `agt` -> **S** (Serine)\n- `gtc` -> **V** (Valine)\n- `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n- `gct` -> **A** (Alanine)\n- `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n- `cga` -> **R** (Arginine)\n- `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n- `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n- `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n\n### Final Answer\nBy concatenating the one-letter codes, we obtain the final protein sequence.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEK\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEK>>>"
