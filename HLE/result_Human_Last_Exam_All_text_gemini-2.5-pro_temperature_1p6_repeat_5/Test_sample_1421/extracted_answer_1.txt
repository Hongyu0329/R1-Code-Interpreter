The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:
$Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$
where:
1.  $\int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi$ is the functional integral over all configurations of the independent Grassmann fields $\bar{\psi}(\tau)$ and $\psi(\tau)$.
2.  The fields are subject to **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in imaginary time $\tau \in [0, \beta]$:
    $\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$
    $\bar{\psi}(\beta) = -\bar{\psi}(0)$
3.  $S[\bar{\psi}, \psi]$ is the Euclidean action of the system, given by:
    $S[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \, \left[ \sum_i \bar{\psi}_i(\tau) (\partial_\tau) \psi_i(\tau) + H(\bar{\psi}, \psi) - \mu N(\bar{\psi}, \psi) \right]$
    where $H(\bar{\psi}, \psi)$ and $N(\bar{\psi}, \psi)$ are the Hamiltonian and particle number operator, respectively, with their creation ($\hat{c}^\dagger$) and annihilation ($\hat{c}$) operators replaced by the Grassmann fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$.
