    "The question asks for the formula for the fermionic partition function Z using the imaginary time path integral formalism. We will break down the derivation and concepts step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Grand Canonical Partition Function**\n\nThe starting point in statistical mechanics for a system of quantum particles is the grand canonical partition function, Z. It is defined as the trace of the density operator:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta (\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\text{Tr}[\\cdot]$ denotes the trace over a complete set of many-body states.\n\nThe goal of the path integral formalism is to represent this trace not as a sum over states of operators, but as an integral over classical-like fields.\n\n**Step 2: From Operators to Fields using Coherent States**\n\nTo transition from the operator formalism to a field-based one, we introduce a basis of states called \"coherent states\". For fermions, we must use **fermionic coherent states**, which are built using **Grassmann numbers**.\n\n*   **Grassmann Numbers:** These are anti-commuting numbers. For any two Grassmann numbers $\\psi_i$ and $\\psi_j$, they obey the anti-commutation relation: $\\psi_i \\psi_j = - \\psi_j \\psi_i$. A direct consequence is that the square of any Grassmann number is zero: $\\psi_i^2 = 0$. This mathematically encodes the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Fermionic Coherent States:** A fermionic coherent state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the fermion annihilation operator $\\hat{c}_k$ with a Grassmann number eigenvalue $\\psi_k$: $\\hat{c}_k |\\psi\\rangle = \\psi_k |\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Introducing Imaginary Time and Path Slicing**\n\nThe term $e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}}$ (where $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N}$) can be viewed as an evolution operator in imaginary time $\\tau = it$, with the total \"time\" duration being $\\beta$. Feynman's path integral idea is to slice this duration $\\beta$ into $M$ infinitesimal steps of size $\\Delta\\tau = \\beta/M$.\n$e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}} = \\left( e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{K}} \\right)^M$\nBetween each slice, we insert a complete set of fermionic coherent states. This procedure transforms the single operator trace into a product of many small matrix elements.\n\n**Step 4: The Continuum Limit and the Euclidean Action**\n\nIn the limit where the number of slices $M \\to \\infty$ (and $\\Delta\\tau \\to 0$), the sum over all the slices becomes a functional integral over continuous fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$. These fields are functions of the imaginary time variable $\\tau$. The expression inside the integral exponentiates to become the **Euclidean Action**, $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$.\n\nThe final formula takes the form of a functional integral:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Integration Variables:** The fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$ are not ordinary complex functions. They are functions whose values at each $\\tau$ are **Grassmann numbers**. The integration measure $\\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi$ symbolizes a functional integral over all possible paths of these anti-commuting fields.\n\n2.  **The Euclidean Action (S):** The action is the time integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian ($S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau L_E$). For a general fermionic system, it has the form:\n    $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu + \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\tau) + H_{int}(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi) \\right]$\n    Here, $\\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau)(\\partial_\\tau)\\psi_k(\\tau)$ is a \"kinetic\" term arising from the imaginary time evolution, $\\epsilon_k$ represents the single-particle energy levels, and $H_{int}$ is the interaction part of the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the Grassmann fields.\n\n3.  **Boundary Conditions:** This is a crucial point for fermions. The trace operation, when evaluated in the fermionic coherent state basis, enforces **anti-periodic boundary conditions (APBC)** in the imaginary time direction. This means the fields must satisfy:\n    $\\psi(\\tau = \\beta) = - \\psi(\\tau = 0)$\n    $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau = \\beta) = - \\bar{\\psi}(\\tau = 0)$\n    This is a direct consequence of the fermionic anti-commutation relations and distinguishes fermions (APBC) from bosons (which have periodic boundary conditions). These boundary conditions imply that in Fourier space, the allowed frequencies (Matsubara frequencies) for fermions are odd integer multiples of $\\pi/\\beta$: $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$.\n\n### The Final Formula\n\nPutting all the pieces together, the path integral representation of the fermionic partition function is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields that are anti-periodic in imaginary time.\n\nThe general formula is:\n$Z = \\int_{\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\nWhere the Euclidean action S is:\n$S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\left[ \\bar{\\psi}(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi) - \\mu) \\psi(\\tau) \\right]$\nHere, $H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$ is the original Hamiltonian operator with creation and annihilation operators replaced by their corresponding Grassmann fields $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$ and $\\psi(\\tau)$. The integration symbol indicates a functional integral over all field configurations satisfying the anti-periodic boundary conditions.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\nwhere:\n1.  $\\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi$ is the functional integral over all configurations of the independent Grassmann fields $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$ and $\\psi(\\tau)$.\n2.  The fields are subject to **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$:\n    $\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$\n    $\\bar{\\psi}(\\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}(0)$\n3.  $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is the Euclidean action of the system, given by:\n    $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\left[ \\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau) \\psi_i(\\tau) + H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi) - \\mu N(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi) \\right]$\n    where $H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$ and $N(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$ are the Hamiltonian and particle number operator, respectively, with their creation ($\\hat{c}^\\dagger$) and annihilation ($\\hat{c}$) operators replaced by the Grassmann fields $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$.>>>"
