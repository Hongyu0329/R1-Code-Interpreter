    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti` into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*seh₂gieti`. This is a third-person singular present tense verb from the root `*seh₂g-`. The cognates (Latin `sāgīre`, Hittite `sākizzi`) confirm this root, which has a meaning of 'to track, perceive, seek out'.\n*   **Laryngeal Effect:** The laryngeal `*h₂` is lost in Proto-Germanic, but it first colors the preceding `*e` vowel to `*a`. This is a long vowel because the laryngeal disappears after the vowel. So, `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sāg-`.\n*   **Grimm's Law:** This is the First Germanic Sound Shift.\n    *   The PIE voiced velar stop `*g` becomes a voiceless velar stop `*k`.\n    *   Thus, the root `*sāg-` becomes `*sāk-` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   (The PIE ending `*-ti` would become PGmc `*-þi` -> `*-iþ`, but we are tracing the verb stem/infinitive.)\n*   **Vowel Shift:** In the dialects that would become North and West Germanic (i.e., not Gothic), the PGmc long vowel `*ā` shifts to a long `*ō`. So, `*sāk-` becomes `*sōk-`. This is often reconstructed back into late Proto-Germanic itself.\n*   **Verb Classification:** PIE *ye/yo*-presents regularly become Class 1 weak verbs in Germanic. The infinitive suffix for these verbs is `*-janą`. Since the root `*sōk-` contains a long vowel, it is a \"heavy stem,\" which uses the connecting vowel `i`.\n*   **Final PGmc Form:** Combining the root `*sōk-` with the suffix `*-ijaną` gives the infinitive **`*sōkijaną`**. The meaning has shifted from 'perceive/track' to the more general 'to seek'.\n\n**2. Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n*   **i-Umlaut:** The `*i` and `*j` in the suffix trigger i-umlaut, fronting and raising the preceding back vowel. PGmc `*ō` is umlauted to Old Norse `œ`.\n*   **Syncope and Apocope:** Unstressed vowels are reduced or lost. The medial `*-i-*` is lost after causing umlaut. The infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a`.\n*   **Consonants:** The `*s`, `*k`, and `*j` sounds remain, with `*kj` being represented as `kj`.\n*   **Final ON Form:** `*sōkijaną` > `*sœ̄kja` > **`sœkja`**.\n\n**3. Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n*   **i-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the `*j` causes i-umlaut. In the pre-Old English period, `*ō` first fronts to `*œ̄` (a sound similar to the one in modern German `schön`). Then, in a specifically Old English development, this front rounded vowel `*œ̄` unrounds to `*ē`.\n*   **Palatalization:** The velar consonant `*k` is palatalized to an affricate `[tʃ]` when it comes before a front vowel (like the newly formed `*ē`). This sound is written with the letter `c`.\n*   **Syncope:** The `*j` is lost after causing umlaut and palatalization in verbs with heavy stems. The infinitive ending `*-an` becomes `-an`.\n*   **Final OE Form:** `*sōkijaną` > `*sōkjan` > (umlaut) `*sœ̄ċan` > (unrounding & palatalization) **`sēcan`**.\n\n**4. Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n*   **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This shift affects voiceless stops.\n    *   The PGmc `*k` does not shift to an affricate (`pf`, `z`) but to a voiceless fricative `[x]`, written `ch` or `hh`. In this context (intervocalically, after a long vowel, and followed by `*j`), it becomes a long fricative `hh` [xx].\n*   **Vowel Shift:** PGmc `*ō` regularly becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n*   **i-Umlaut:** While i-umlaut does exist in OHG (`uo` > `üe`), it is not consistently marked in writing for the infinitive form of this verb class. The infinitive retains the `uo`.\n*   **Final OHG Form:** `*sōkijaną` > (vowel and consonant shift) `*suohhjan` > (ending reduction) **`suohhen`**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   **Laryngeals:** Correctly applying the coloring effect of `*h₂` on `*e` to get `*ā`.\n*   **Grimm's Law:** Correctly applying `*g` > `*k`.\n*   **Vowel System:** Recognizing the crucial North/West Germanic shift of `*ā` > `*ō`.\n*   **Verb Classes:** Identifying the PIE form as a precursor to the Germanic Class 1 weak verbs.\n*   **i-Umlaut:** Applying the correct, language-specific results of i-umlaut on the vowel `*ō` (ON: `œ`; OE: `ē`; OHG: `uo` > `üe`, but not in the infinitive).\n*   **Language-Specific Consonant Shifts:** Applying OE palatalization (`k` > `c` [tʃ]) and the OHG Second Sound Shift (`kj` > `hh` [xx]).\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: `*sōkijaną`\nOld Norse: `sœkja`\nOld English: `sēcan`\nOld High German: `suohhen`>>>"
