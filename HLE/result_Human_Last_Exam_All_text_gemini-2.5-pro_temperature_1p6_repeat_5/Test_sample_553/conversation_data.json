    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question\n\nThe question asks for a song by The Beatles that begins with a specific harmonic movement: a \"chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\". Let's break down these musical terms:\n\n*   **Tonic:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the first chord in the scale, often designated with the Roman numeral I (for a major chord) or i (for a minor chord). It provides a sense of rest and resolution.\n*   **Minor fifth chord (v):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale, but played as a *minor* chord.\n    *   In a **major key**, the chord on the fifth degree is naturally a major chord (V). For example, in C major, the fifth chord is G major. A *minor* fifth chord (G minor) would be a non-standard, \"borrowed\" chord.\n    *   In a **minor key**, the chord on the fifth degree is naturally a minor chord (v). For example, in A minor, the fifth chord is E minor.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for a Beatles song that starts with a progression of **I -> v** (in a major key) or **i -> v** (in a minor key). The second scenario (in a minor key) is more common in popular music.\n\n### Step 2: Search for the Song\n\nWe need to analyze the opening chords of Beatles songs, specifically those in a minor key, as the i -> v progression is a very natural and identifiable sound.\n\nLet's consider the song **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Opening of \"Michelle\"\n\n1.  **Key Signature:** The song's verse section, which opens the track, is in the key of F minor.\n2.  **Tonic Chord (i):** In the key of F minor, the tonic chord (i) is **F minor (Fm)**.\n3.  **The Fifth (v):** The fifth note of the F minor scale is C. A minor chord built on this note is a **C minor (Cm)**. This is the minor fifth (v) chord of the F minor key.\n4.  **Opening Progression:** The song begins with Paul McCartney's vocals and acoustic guitar.\n    *   The first musical phrase is sung over the **Fm** chord (\"Michelle, ma...\"). This is the tonic (i).\n    *   The very next chord, on the word \"...belle\", is a **Cm** chord. This is the minor fifth (v).\n\nThis opening progression, **Fm -> Cm**, perfectly matches the description of a jump from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord (i -> v). The melancholic and slightly wistful sound of this change is a defining characteristic of the song's introduction.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the harmony of the song's introduction, we can confirm that \"Michelle\" begins with the progression from its tonic chord (F minor) to its minor fifth chord (C minor).\n\n***\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
