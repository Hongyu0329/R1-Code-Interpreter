    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The user wants to identify the specific range of verses (pl. *abyat*, s. *bayt*) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam where the names of the 25 prophets required for a Muslim to know are listed.\n\n2.  **Identify the Poem and Author:** The poem is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (عقيدة العوام), a famous introductory text on Islamic creed. The author is Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi al-Maliki. The poem is well-known and has a standard structure and verse count (typically 57 abyat).\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** We need to find the section within the poem dedicated to the Prophets and Messengers (*Anbiya' wal-Mursaleen*). This section begins with a verse that introduces the obligation of knowing the names of these 25 prophets.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Starting Verse:**\n    *   The introduction to the list of prophets is found in **Bayt 27**. This verse states the number of prophets whose names are obligatory to know, but it does not list any names itself. It reads:\n        > تفصيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وعِشرينَ لَزِمْ *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ واغْتَنِمْ\n        > (The details of twenty-five are a must / For every legally responsible person, so verify and seize the opportunity)\n    *   The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the very next verse.\n\n5.  **Trace the Verses Containing the Names:**\n    *   **Bayt 28** begins the list:\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ *** صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        > (They are Adam, Idris, Noah, Hud along with / Salih, and Abraham, each is to be followed)\n    *   **Bayt 29** continues the list:\n        > لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقٌ كَذَا *** يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n        > (Lot, and Ishmael, Isaac as well / Jacob, Joseph, and Job who followed the path)\n    *   **Bayt 30** continues the list:\n        > شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ *** ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n        > (Shu'ayb, Aaron, and Moses, and Elisha / Dhul-Kifl, David, Solomon who followed)\n    *   **Bayt 31** concludes the list:\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        > (Elias, Jonah, Zechariah, John / Jesus, and Taha (Prophet Muhammad), the seal; leave misguidance)\n\n6.  **Determine the Ending Verse:** The list concludes in **Bayt 31** with the name of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is referred to by the honorific title \"Taha\" (طه).\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the step-by-step tracing of the verses, the names of the prophets are mentioned starting from Bayt 28 and ending at Bayt 31.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Standard Numbering:** This analysis is based on the standard and most common numbering of the poem's 57 verses.\n*   **The Introductory Verse:** While the *mention of the names* is from Bayt 28 to 31, the context and introduction for this list is provided in Bayt 27. However, the question specifically asks for the verses where the names *are mentioned*.\n*   **Name of the Final Prophet:** Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is not mentioned by his common name but by the honorific title \"Taha\" (طه), which is taken from the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an. This is common in classical Islamic poetry.\n*   **Verification of the Count:** The poem mentions \"twenty-five\" in Bayt 27, and a count of the names listed from Bayt 28 to 31 confirms that exactly 25 prophets are named.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Step 1:** The section on the Prophets begins at Bayt 27 with an introductory statement.\n*   **Step 2:** The first verse to contain the names of the Prophets is Bayt 28.\n*   **Step 3:** The list of names continues through verses 29 and 30.\n*   **Step 4:** The list concludes in Bayt 31, which contains the final names, including the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad ﷺ.\n*   **Step 5:** Therefore, the range of verses where the names of the prophets are explicitly mentioned is from Bayt 28 to Bayt 31.\n\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 31>>>"
