    "Answering this question requires finding the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices. We will use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Matrices**\n\nLet the two given polynomial matrices be:\nP1(s) = [ s² + s , -s      ;\n          -s² - 1,  s²     ]\n\nP2(s) = [ s       , 0       ;\n          -s - 1  , 1       ]\n\n**2. Set up the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nTo find the GCRD, we form a block matrix M(s) by stacking P1(s) on top of P2(s). Then, we apply elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to a form `[G(s); 0]`, where G(s) is a 2x2 matrix and 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting matrix G(s) will be a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nThe initial matrix M(s) is:\nM(s) =\n[ R1:  s² + s , -s      ]\n[ R2: -s² - 1,  s²      ]\n[ R3:  s      ,  0      ]\n[ R4: -s - 1 ,  1      ]\n\n**Careful point:** Elementary row operations on polynomial matrices are:\ni) Swapping two rows.\nii) Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\niii) Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\nThese operations are equivalent to left-multiplying the matrix by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant).\n\n**3. Perform Row Reduction**\n\nOur goal is to introduce zeros into the matrix. We'll use the row with the lowest-degree polynomial in the first column as a pivot. Here, R3 has `s` (degree 1), which is the lowest.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Use R3 to eliminate other entries in the first column.**\n    *   To eliminate the first element of R1 (`s² + s`), we note that `s² + s = (s+1) * s`. So, we perform `R1_new ← R1 - (s+1)R3`.\n        `R1_new = [(s² + s) - (s+1)s, -s - (s+1)0] = [0, -s]`\n    *   To eliminate the first element of R2 (`-s² - 1`), we note that `-s² - 1 = (-s) * s - 1`. So, we perform `R2_new ← R2 + s*R3`.\n        `R2_new = [(-s² - 1) + s*s, s² + s*0] = [-1, s²]`\n    *   To eliminate the first element of R4 (`-s - 1`), we note that `-s - 1 = (-1) * s - 1`. So, we perform `R4_new ← R4 + 1*R3`.\n        `R4_new = [(-s - 1) + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]`\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M'(s) =\n    [ R1':  0   , -s  ]\n    [ R2': -1   , s²  ]\n    [ R3':  s   ,  0  ]\n    [ R4': -1   ,  1  ]\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Use a new pivot to continue reducing the first column.**\n    The rows R2' and R4' now contain a `-1` in the first column, which makes for an excellent pivot. Let's use R4' (`[-1, 1]`).\n    *   `R2'_new ← R2' - R4'`: `[-1 - (-1), s² - 1] = [0, s² - 1]`\n    *   `R3'_new ← R3' + s*R4'`: `[s + s(-1), 0 + s*1] = [0, s]`\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    M''(s) =\n    [ R1'':  0   , -s      ]  (Unchanged R1')\n    [ R2'':  0   , s² - 1  ]\n    [ R3'':  0   , s       ]\n    [ R4'': -1   , 1       ]  (Unchanged R4')\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Reduce the second column.**\n    The first column is now reduced. We look at the submatrix formed by rows with a leading zero (R1'', R2'', R3''). We pivot on the row with the lowest-degree entry in the second column, which is R3'' (`[0, s]`).\n    *   `R1''_new ← R1'' + R3''`: `[0, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n    *   `R2''_new ← R2'' - s*R3''`: `[0, (s² - 1) - s*s] = [0, -1]`\n\n    The matrix transforms into:\n    M'''(s) =\n    [ R1''':  0   ,  0 ]\n    [ R2''':  0   , -1 ]\n    [ R3''':  0   ,  s ]  (Unchanged R3'')\n    [ R4''': -1   ,  1 ]  (Unchanged R4'')\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Final reduction steps.**\n    We now have two rows that can be used as pivots: R2''' and R4'''. Let's use R2''' (`[0, -1]`) to eliminate the `s` in R3'''.\n    *   `R3'''_new ← R3''' + s*R2'''`: `[0 + s*0, s + s*(-1)] = [0, 0]`\n    We are left with two non-zero rows: `[0, -1]` and `[-1, 1]`. Let's use the row `[0, -1]` to simplify `[-1, 1]`.\n    *   `R4'''_new ← R4''' + R2'''`: `[-1 + 0, 1 + (-1)] = [-1, 0]`\n\n    The matrix finally becomes:\n    M'''' (s) =\n    [  0   ,  0 ]\n    [  0   , -1 ]\n    [  0   ,  0 ]\n    [ -1   ,  0 ]\n\n**4. Extract the GCRD**\n\nWe have successfully obtained two zero rows. The remaining non-zero rows form the GCRD. Let's collect them and reorder them into a 2x2 matrix G(s).\nThe non-zero rows are `[-1, 0]` and `[0, -1]`.\n\nG(s) = [ -1, 0 ;\n          0, -1 ]\n\nThis matrix G(s) is a greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2.\n\n**5. Canonical Form**\n\nThe GCRD is unique only up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. The matrix G(s) we found is `-I` (the negative of the identity matrix). It is unimodular since `det(G(s)) = 1`, which is a non-zero constant.\n\nOften, a GCRD is given in a canonical form, such as the identity matrix if possible. We can obtain the identity matrix from our result G(s) by elementary row operations:\n*   `R1 ← -1 * R1`: `[-1, 0] → [1, 0]`\n*   `R2 ← -1 * R2`: `[0, -1] → [0, 1]`\n\nThis gives the GCRD in its simplest form, the identity matrix:\nG_canonical(s) = [ 1, 0 ;\n                   0, 1 ]\n\nThe fact that the GCRD is a unimodular matrix (like `I` or `-I`) means that the original matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are **right coprime**.\n\nFinal answer is the canonical GCRD matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
