    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given classical ballet steps can have the same leg position at the end of the movement as it had at the beginning. The typical starting and ending position for these steps is the fifth position. We need to analyze the mechanics of each step to see if the feet are in the same configuration (e.g., right foot front) at the start and finish.\n\n1.  **Analyze A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position demi-plié (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Entrechat\" means \"interweaving\" or \"braiding.\" The number \"six\" refers to the six movements of the legs in the air (open-close-open-close-open-close). For an *entrechat* where the feet land crossed (like *quatre*, *six*, *huit*), an even number always results in the feet changing position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position demi-plié with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n2.  **Analyze B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position demi-plié (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** The name itself provides the answer. *Échappé* means to escape (jumping from a closed to an open position). *Battu* means beaten (the legs beat together during the jump back to fifth). *Changé* explicitly means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** The feet change position. The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n3.  **Analyze C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position demi-plié (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" The step involves one leg brushing out while the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and then both legs are \"assembled\" together in the air to land simultaneously in fifth position. There are several types of *assemblé*.\n        *   In an *assemblé dessous* (under), the working leg starts from the back, brushes to the side, and closes in the back. For example, if you start with the right foot in front, the left (back) foot will perform the *assemblé* and return to the back.\n        *   In an *assemblé en arrière* (backward), the back foot brushes to the back and returns to the back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In the cases of *assemblé dessous* and *assemblé en arrière*, the dancer lands in the exact same fifth position they started in (e.g., right foot in front). While other types of *assemblé* (*dessus*, *en avant*) do change the feet, the existence of these common non-changing variations means that an *assemblé* *can* end in the same position it started.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions can be the same.\n\n4.  **Analyze D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position demi-plié (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means to glide. \"Derrière\" means behind. The back foot glides out to the side, the weight is transferred to it, and the front foot then closes *behind* the new standing leg.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If you start with the right foot in front, the left (back) foot glides out. The right foot then closes behind the left. The result is the left foot is now in front. The feet have changed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n5.  **Analyze E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position demi-plié (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative jump similar to a *pas de chat*, where one or both legs perform a small *rond de jambe en l'air* (circle of the leg in the air). In its standard execution, the step travels to the side and involves changing the feet upon landing.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands with the feet in the opposite configuration from the start.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Terminology is Key:** Words like *changé* (changed), *derrière* (behind), and even numbers in *entrechats* provide direct clues about whether the feet will switch position.\n*   **Step Variations:** Some steps have multiple versions. *Assemblé* is a general term that includes variations that change the feet (*dessus*) and variations that do not (*dessous*). The question asks which step *can* have the same ending position, making *assemblé* a valid answer.\n*   **Direction of Movement:** The direction of a linking step like *glissade* determines how the feet close, almost always resulting in a change from the initial position.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAfter analyzing all the options, *Assemblé* is the only step among the choices that includes common, fundamental variations (*assemblé dessous* and *assemblé en arrière*) where the dancer lands in the exact same fifth position from which they started. The other steps, by their definition and standard execution, all result in a change of feet.\n\n<<<C>>>"
