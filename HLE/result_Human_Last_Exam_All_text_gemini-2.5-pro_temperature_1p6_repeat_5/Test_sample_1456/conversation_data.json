    "This is a problem in the field of topology, specifically concerning continuum theory. To solve it, we need to understand the definitions of continuum, composant, and how these concepts behave under the operation of a Cartesian product.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Continuum:** As stated in the question, a continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n2.  **Nondegenerate Continuum:** This simply means the continuum is not a single point. Examples include the closed interval `[0,1]`, a circle, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve (with its limit bar) or the pseudo-arc.\n3.  **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that there exists a *proper subcontinuum* of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. A proper subcontinuum is a subspace that is a continuum itself and is a proper subset of `X`.\n\n### Step 2: Key Properties of Composants\n\n1.  **Partition:** The set of all composants of a continuum `X` forms a partition of `X`. This means every point of `X` belongs to exactly one composant.\n2.  **Number of Composants:** A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that a continuum has more than one composant if and only if it is **indecomposable**. A continuum `X` is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n3.  **Decomposable Continua:** If a continuum is decomposable (e.g., `[0,1] = [0, 2/3] U [1/3, 1]`), it has exactly **one** composant, which is the space itself.\n4.  **Indecomposable Continua:** If a continuum is indecomposable, it has multiple composants. The number of a composants can be countably infinite or uncountably infinite. A crucial fact is that the number of a composants in any indecomposable continuum is at most **c**, the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., the \"size\" of the set of real numbers, `2^{\\aleph_0}`). Furthermore, there exist continua that achieve this maximum number of `c` composants (e.g., the Knaster \"bucket-handle\" continuum, the pseudo-arc).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Composants in a Product Space\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Let `Z = X \\times Y` be their product. Since `X` and `Y` are compact and connected, `Z` is also a compact and connected metric space, i.e., `Z` is a continuum. We want to find the largest possible number of composants of `Z`.\n\nTo maximize the number of a composants, we should choose `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua, as decomposable ones lead to products with only one composant.\n\nLet `(x, y)` be a point in `Z = X \\times Y`. Let `C_X(x)` denote the composant of `x` in `X`, and `C_Y(y)` denote the composant of `y` in `Y`. Let `C_Z((x, y))` denote the composant of `(x, y)` in `Z`.\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to determine the structure of `C_Z((x, y))`.\n\n**Claim:** The composant of `(x, y)` in `X \\times Y` is the set `(C_X(x) \\times Y) \\cup (X \\times C_Y(y))`.\n\n**Justification of the Claim:**\n\n*   **Part A: `(C_X(x) \\times Y) \\cup (X \\times C_Y(y)) \\subseteq C_Z((x, y))`**\n    *   Let `(x', y')` be a point in `C_X(x) \\times Y`. This means `x' \\in C_X(x)`. By definition, there exists a proper subcontinuum `A \\subset X` such that `x, x' \\in A`. Consider the set `K = A \\times Y`. Since `A` is a proper subset of `X`, `K` is a proper subset of `X \\times Y`. `K` is the product of two continua (`A` and `Y`), so it is a continuum. It contains `(x, y')` and `(x', y')`. Now, consider the set `K' = X \\times \\{y'}`. This is a proper subcontinuum containing `(x, y')` and `(x', y')`. So all points in `C_X(x) \\times Y` are in the same composant. But to connect them to `(x,y)`, consider `A \\times \\{y'\\} \\cup \\{x\\} \\times Y`. A simpler way: The set `A \\times Y` is a proper subcontinuum containing both `(x,y)` and `(x', y')`. Therefore, every point of `C_X(x) \\times Y` lies in the composant `C_Z((x,y))`.\n    *   A symmetric argument shows that every point of `X \\times C_Y(y)` also lies in `C_Z((x,y))`.\n    *   Thus, the union is contained in `C_Z((x,y))`.\n\n*   **Part B: `C_Z((x, y)) \\subseteq (C_X(x) \\times Y) \\cup (X \\times C_Y(y))`**\n    *   Let `(x', y')` be in `C_Z((x, y))`. This means there is a proper subcontinuum `K \\subset X \\times Y` containing both `(x, y)` and `(x', y')`.\n    *   Let `\\pi_X: X \\times Y \\to X` and `\\pi_Y: X \\times Y \\to Y` be the projection maps.\n    *   `\\pi_X(K)` is a subcontinuum of `X` containing `x` and `x'`.\n    *   `\\pi_Y(K)` is a subcontinuum of `Y` containing `y` and `y'`.\n    *   A critical theorem from continuum theory states that if `X` and `Y` are indecomposable continua, then for any *proper* subcontinuum `K \\subset X \\times Y`, it must be the case that either `\\pi_X(K) \\neq X` or `\\pi_Y(K) \\neq Y`. (It cannot project onto both factors).\n    *   Case 1: `\\pi_X(K) \\neq X`. Then `\\pi_X(K)` is a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing `x` and `x'`. By the definition of a composant, this means `x' \\in C_X(x)`. Consequently, the point `(x', y')` is in the set `C_X(x) \\times Y`.\n    *   Case 2: `\\pi_Y(K) \\neq Y`. Then `\\pi_Y(K)` is a proper subcontinuum of `Y` containing `y` and `y'`. This means `y' \\in C_Y(y)`. Consequently, `(x', y')` is in the set `X \\times C_Y(y)`.\n    *   Since at least one of these cases must hold, `(x', y')` must be in `(C_X(x) \\times Y) \\cup (X \\times C_Y(y))`.\n\nThis confirms our claim about the structure of the a composants in the product.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Composants\n\nNow we must determine how many distinct sets of the form `(C_X(x) \\times Y) \\cup (X \\times C_Y(y))` there are.\n\nLet's see when two such sets are identical.\n` (C_X(x_1) \\times Y) \\cup (X \\times C_Y(y_1)) = (C_X(x_2) \\times Y) \\cup (X \\times C_Y(y_2)) `\nThis equality holds if and only if `C_X(x_1) = C_X(x_2)` AND `C_Y(y_1) = C_Y(y_2)`.\n\n*Proof*: The `if` part is trivial. For the `only if` part, assume `C_X(x_1) \\neq C_X(x_2)`. Since composants partition the space, these two sets are disjoint. Let `x' \\in C_X(x_1)`. Because we are using indecomposable continua, `C_Y(y_2)` is a proper subset of `Y`, so we can pick a `y'` such that `y' \\notin C_Y(y_2)`.\nNow consider the point `p = (x', y')`.\n*   Is `p` in the first set? Yes, because `x' \\in C_X(x_1)`, so `p \\in C_X(x_1) \\times Y`.\n*   Is `p` in the second set? `p` is in `(C_X(x_2) \\times Y) \\cup (X \\times C_Y(y_2))` only if `x' \\in C_X(x_2)` or `y' \\in C_Y(y_2)`. We chose `x'` such that `x' \\notin C_X(x_2)` and `y'` such that `y' \\notin C_Y(y_2)`. So `p` is not in the second set.\nThis contradiction shows that we must have `C_X(x_1) = C_X(x_2)`. A similar argument shows `C_Y(y_1) = C_Y(y_2)`.\n\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of composants of `X \\times Y` and the Cartesian product of the sets of composants of `X` and `Y`.\nLet `Comp(S)` be the set of a composants of a space `S`. Then we have a bijection:\n`Comp(X \\times Y) \\longleftrightarrow Comp(X) \\times Comp(Y)`\n\nThe number of composants is therefore:\n`|Comp(X \\times Y)| = |Comp(X)| \\times |Comp(Y)|`\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Maximum\n\nTo find the largest possible number of a composants of the product, we must choose `X` and `Y` to maximize the number of their own composants.\nAs discussed in Step 2, the maximum possible number of composants for a nondegenerate continuum is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum. We can choose `X` and `Y` to be, for example, two Knaster continua or two pseudo-arcs, for which `|Comp(X)| = c` and `|Comp(Y)| = c`.\n\nThe largest possible number of a composants in the product is then:\n`|Comp(X)| \\times |Comp(Y)| = c \\times c`\n\nBy the laws of cardinal arithmetic, `c \\times c = (2^{\\aleph_0}) \\times (2^{\\aleph_0}) = 2^{\\aleph_0 + \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c`.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of a composants is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum."
