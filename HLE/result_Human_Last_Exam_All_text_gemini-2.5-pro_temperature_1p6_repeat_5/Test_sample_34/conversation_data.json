    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game. This is a standard theoretical environment. \"Rake-free\" implies that we don't need to be quite as tight with our marginal hands as we would in a real game, making our opening ranges slightly wider.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker. We are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street, which gives us a significant informational advantage. This allows us to profitably play a very wide range of hands.\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size that balances risk and reward, aiming to build a pot while potentially stealing the blinds.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find the \"worst\" suited Jack (a hand like JXs, where X is another card of the same suit) that is still a standard, profitable open-raise in this situation. \"Worst\" refers to the hand with the lowest expected value (EV) that still clears the bar for being a profitable open versus folding.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Hand Strength from the Button:**\n    The value of a starting hand, especially from a late position like the button, comes from several factors:\n    *   **High Card Value:** The ability to make strong top pairs. A Jack is a good, but not elite, high card.\n    *   **Suitedness:** The ability to make flushes. All hands under consideration are suited, which adds significant value.\n    *   **Connectivity:** The ability to make straights. Hands with cards close in rank (e.g., JTs) are more valuable than hands with a large gap (e.g., J2s).\n\n3.  **Ranking Suited Jack Hands:**\n    Let's list the suited Jack hands and consider their relative strengths. They are naturally ranked by their second card, or \"kicker.\"\n    *   **Premium Tier (AJs, KJs, QJs):** These are very strong hands with high card value and suitedness. They are always opened from any position.\n    *   **Strong Tier (JTs, J9s):** These hands have excellent connectivity and make very strong straights and flushes. They are clear opens. JTs is a \"suited connector\" and J9s is a \"suited one-gapper.\"\n    *   **Mid Tier (J8s, J7s, J6s):** As the kicker gets lower, the connectivity decreases. The gap between the Jack and the kicker widens, reducing the frequency with which you'll flop straight draws. However, they still have decent playability due to being suited and having a Jack.\n    *   **Low Tier (J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s):** These are the weakest suited Jacks. Their straight potential with the Jack is almost non-existent. Their main value comes from making flushes, a pair of Jacks, or a pair with the low card.\n\n4.  **Identifying the \"Worst\" Candidate:**\n    *   A standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) opening range from the button is very wide, typically including 45-50% of all starting hands. This is because the positional advantage is so powerful that it makes even marginal hands profitable to play.\n    *   Within this wide range, GTO solvers have determined that *all suited Jacks*, from AJs down to the very weakest, J2s, are profitable opens.\n    *   The reason J2s is the worst of the bunch is because the kicker (the 2) contributes the least value.\n        *   **Lowest Connectivity:** The gap between a Jack and a 2 is the largest possible for a Jx hand. This makes forming a straight with both cards extremely unlikely.\n        *   **Lowest Kicker Value:** If you make a pair of Jacks, a 2 is the worst possible kicker. If you flop a pair of 2s, it's a very weak pair.\n    *   Comparing J2s to J3s, J4s, and J5s: While all are weak, the 3, 4, and 5 have slightly more straight potential on low-card boards (e.g., a hand like J5s can flop a gutshot straight draw on a board of A-3-4). The 2 offers the absolute minimum in this regard.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since a proper strategy involves opening all suited Jacks from the button, the one at the very bottom of the range is the \"worst\" one you should still open. Following the ranking of kickers, J2s is demonstrably the weakest hand in the JXs category due to its poor connectivity and low kicker value. It is the most marginal, lowest EV hand of its type that is still considered a standard open-raise.\n\n***\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
