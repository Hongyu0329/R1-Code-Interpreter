    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** The let-7 family of microRNAs (miRNAs).\n    *   **Specific Organism:** Humans (Homo sapiens).\n    *   **Specific Question:** The total number of members identified \"to date.\" This requires finding the current, scientifically accepted count.\n\n2.  **Define \"Family Member\":**\n    *   In the context of miRNA families, a \"member\" typically refers to a unique mature miRNA sequence.\n    *   It is crucial to distinguish this from the number of genes (precursor miRNAs). A single mature miRNA can be encoded by multiple different genes located at different places in the genome. For example, the mature `let-7a` miRNA is produced from three distinct genes (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`). The question is about the number of distinct mature products, not the number of genes that produce them.\n\n3.  **Identify Authoritative Sources:**\n    *   To get an accurate count, we must refer to primary bioinformatics databases and well-established scientific literature.\n    *   **miRBase:** This is the central, public repository for all published microRNA sequences and annotation. It is the gold standard for this type of information.\n    *   **NCBI and Ensembl:** These are major genome databases that also curate information on miRNA genes.\n    *   **Review Articles:** Scientific reviews on miRNA biology provide a consensus view of the field.\n\n4.  **List the Members:**\n    *   By querying miRBase for the let-7 family in *Homo sapiens* (prefix: hsa-), we can compile a list of the recognized members. The let-7 family is defined by a highly conserved \"seed sequence.\"\n    *   The members identified in humans are:\n        1.  `let-7a`\n        2.  `let-7b`\n        3.  `let-7c`\n        4.  `let-7d`\n        5.  `let-7e`\n        6.  `let-7f`\n        7.  `let-7g`\n        8.  `let-7i`\n    *   **Special Case:** Another miRNA, `miR-98`, shares the same seed sequence as the let-7 family and is functionally and evolutionarily related. Therefore, it is universally considered a member of the human let-7 family despite its different name.\n\n5.  **Address Potential Points of Confusion (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Absence of `let-7h`:** It is a notable fact that there is no `let-7h` member identified in humans, though the letter is used for other species.\n    *   **Mature vs. Precursor Count:** As mentioned in step 2, there are more *genes* for let-7 than mature members. There are 12 precursor let-7 genes in humans that process into the 9 mature family members. Answering with the number of genes (12) would be incorrect for the question asked.\n    *   **\"To Date\":** The let-7 family is one of the first and most intensely studied miRNA families. While science always evolves, the core membership of this family in humans has been stable for many years. The current count is well-established.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Count:**\n    *   Counting the listed members: `let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i` (which is 8 members) plus `miR-98` (1 member).\n    *   Total = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis of primary databases like miRBase and the scientific consensus, there are 9 distinct mature microRNAs that constitute the let-7 family in humans.\n\n<<<9>>>"
