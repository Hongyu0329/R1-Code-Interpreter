    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   **System:** A particle confined to a one-dimensional box of length 'a'. The box extends from x = 0 to x = a.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the n = 2 energy eigenstate.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the probability of finding the particle within the small interval from x1 = 0.495a to x2 = 0.505a.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Quantum Mechanics Formulas**\n\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   The probability density, which is the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position x, is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    $P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   The probability of finding the particle in an interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    $Prob(x_1 \\le x \\le x_2) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} P(x) \\,dx = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\,dx$\n\n**3. Substitute the Specific Values into the Probability Integral**\n\n*   Quantum number, n = 2.\n*   Lower limit of integration, $x_1 = 0.495a$.\n*   Upper limit of integration, $x_2 = 0.505a$.\n\nThe integral for the probability becomes:\n$Prob = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\,dx$\n\n**4. Choose a Method to Solve the Integral**\n\nThe interval of interest, $\\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 0.01a$, is very small. We have two main approaches:\n*   **Method A: Approximation.** Because the interval is small, we can approximate the integrand.\n*   **Method B: Exact Integration.** We can solve the integral analytically.\n\nLet's use the approximation method, as it is often simpler for such problems and provides great accuracy.\n\n**5. Applying the Approximation Method**\n\nA simple approximation is $Prob \\approx P(x_{center}) \\cdot \\Delta x$. However, the center of our interval is $x = 0.5a$. For n=2, the probability density at this point is:\n$P(0.5a) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi) = 0$\nThis point is a node of the n=2 state. The simple approximation gives a probability of 0, which is not accurate because the probability is non-zero everywhere else in the interval.\n\nWe need a better approximation. We can approximate the shape of the function around the node. Let's make a change of variables to center the integral at zero. Let $y = x - 0.5a$, which means $x = y + 0.5a$. The new integration limits are from $y = -0.005a$ to $y = +0.005a$.\n\nThe term inside the sine function becomes:\n$\\frac{2\\pi x}{a} = \\frac{2\\pi (y + 0.5a)}{a} = \\frac{2\\pi y}{a} + \\pi$\nSo the integral becomes:\n$Prob = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a} + \\pi\\right) \\,dy$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, it follows that $\\sin^2(\\theta + \\pi) = \\sin^2(\\theta)$.\n$Prob = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right) \\,dy$\n\nNow, for small arguments $\\theta$, we can use the Taylor approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$. The argument is $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi y}{a}$. Since y is very small within our interval, this is a valid approximation.\n$\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right) \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 y^2}{a^2}$\n\nSubstituting this approximation into our integral:\n$Prob \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dy = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} y^2 \\,dy$\n\n**6. Evaluate the Final Integral**\nNow we evaluate the simple integral of $y^2$:\n$\\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} y^2 \\,dy = \\left[\\frac{y^3}{3}\\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} = \\frac{(0.005a)^3}{3} - \\frac{(-0.005a)^3}{3} = 2 \\times \\frac{(0.005a)^3}{3}$\n\nNow, substitute this result back into our probability expression:\n$Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left(2 \\times \\frac{(0.005a)^3}{3}\\right)$\nThe $a^3$ terms cancel out:\n$Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n$Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\nUsing $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$:\n$Prob \\approx \\frac{16 \\times (9.8696)}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n$Prob \\approx 52.638 \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n$Prob \\approx 65.7975 \\times 10^{-7}$\n$Prob \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n### List of Careful Points\n*   **Correct Wavefunction:** Always start with the correct, normalized wavefunction for the given state (n=2).\n*   **Identify Special Points:** Recognize that the interval is centered on a node (x = a/2) of the n=2 wavefunction. This is a critical feature of the problem.\n*   **Approximation Choice:** Understand why the simplest approximation ($Prob \\approx P(x_{center}) \\Delta x$) fails at a node and that a Taylor series approximation of the integrand function is required.\n*   **Small Angle Approximation:** Be sure that the argument of the sine function is small enough for the approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$ to be valid. In this case, the maximum angle is $0.01\\pi$, which is small.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** Perform the change of variables and subsequent integration carefully, keeping track of all constants and exponents.\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state is approximately $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
