The mathematical formulation for the vertical cross-sections of an Interval Type-3 Membership Function (IT3 MF) using a Gaussian-based paradigm is given by the lower and upper bounds of the membership grade for a secondary variable `u`, given a fixed primary variable `x`. These bounds, `μ_Ã_L(x, u)` and `μ_Ã_U(x, u)`, define the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) of the Interval Type-2 (IT2) MF that constitutes the vertical slice.

The formulation is as follows:

Lower Bound Membership Function:
`μ_Ã_L(x, u) = exp( - (u - m_u(x))² / (2 * σ_{L,u}(x)²) )`

Upper Bound Membership Function:
`μ_Ã_U(x, u) = exp( - (u - m_u(x))² / (2 * σ_{U,u}(x)²) )`

Where:
*   `x` is the primary input variable.
*   `u` is the secondary input variable (membership grade).
*   `m_u(x)` is a function that defines the mean of the Gaussian vertical slice as it varies with `x`.
*   `σ_{L,u}(x)` is a function defining the standard deviation for the lower bound as it varies with `x`.
*   `σ_{U,u}(x)` is a function defining the standard deviation for the upper bound as it varies with `x`.

A necessary condition for this to be a valid formulation is that `μ_Ã_L(x, u) ≤ μ_Ã_U(x, u)`, which implies:
`σ_{U,u}(x) ≥ σ_{L,u}(x)` for all `x` in the domain.
