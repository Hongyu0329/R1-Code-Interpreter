    "To find the number of self-intersection points of the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we need to find the number of distinct points `(x, y)` on the curve that are visited for at least two different parameter values, `t1` and `t2`.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the period of the curve.**\nThe function `x(t) = cos(9t)` is periodic with period `T_x = 2π/9`.\nThe function `y(t) = sin(5t)` is periodic with period `T_y = 2π/5`.\nThe entire curve is traced when `t` ranges over an interval of length equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods.\n`T = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1/GCD(9, 5)) = 2π * (1/1) = 2π`.\nSo, we consider `t` in the interval `[0, 2π)`.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the conditions for a self-intersection.**\nA self-intersection occurs at a point `(x, y)` if there exist two distinct values `t1` and `t2` in `[0, 2π)` such that:\n1. `x(t1) = x(t2)`  => `cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)`\n2. `y(t1) = y(t2)`  => `sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)`\n\n**Step 3: Solve the trigonometric equations.**\nFrom `cos(A) = cos(B)`, we have `A = ±B + 2kπ` for some integer `k`.\nSo, `9*t1 = ±9*t2 + 2kπ`. Since `t1 ≠ t2`, the `+` sign with `k=0` is excluded.\n\nFrom `sin(A) = sin(B)`, we have `A = B + 2mπ` or `A = π - B + 2mπ` for some integer `m`.\nSo, `5*t1 = 5*t2 + 2mπ` or `5*t1 = π - 5*t2 + 2mπ`. Again, the first case with `m=0` is excluded.\n\nWe must find pairs `(t1, t2)` that satisfy one condition from the cosine equation and one from the sine equation.\n\nThis algebraic path is quite complex and involves careful casework and counting, including checking for duplicate points. A more direct method for this specific type of curve (a Lissajous curve) is to use a known formula.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the formula for Lissajous curves.**\nThe curve is of the form `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, where `a=9` and `b=5`.\nFor this type of Lissajous curve, where `a` and `b` are coprime odd integers greater than 1, there is a standard formula for the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe argument for this formula relies on a topological view. The curve is contained within the rectangle `[-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`. The vertical tangent lines `x = ±1` are touched `a` times, and the horizontal tangent lines `y = ±1` are touched `b` times. These tangent lines can be thought of as forming a grid. The number of self-intersections relates to how many times the curve crosses itself within the cells of this grid.\n\nFor the curve `x = cos(at), y = sin(bt)` where `a` and `b` are coprime odd integers greater than 1, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n`N = (a - 1)(b - 1)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of self-intersection points.**\nIn our case, `a = 9` and `b = 5`. Both are odd, greater than 1, and coprime (`GCD(9, 5) = 1`).\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`N = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1)`\n`N = 8 * 4`\n`N = 32`\n\nThus, there are 32 self-intersection points on the curve.\n\nFinal check: This formula is specific to the `(cos, sin)` form with odd coprime coefficients. For other forms like `(sin, sin)` or with different parity coefficients, the formula changes. Given the problem's structure, applying this known result is the most reliable method.\n\n<<<32>>>"
