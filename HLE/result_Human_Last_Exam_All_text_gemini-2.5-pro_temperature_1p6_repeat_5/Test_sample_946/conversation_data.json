    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source Material:** The question specifies the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n2.  **Identify the Specific Episode:** The question narrows the source down to a particular installment, \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n3.  **Identify the Event:** The event within the episode is the Junior Prom.\n4.  **Identify the \"Performer\":** The question notes that the performer is not a live person or animated character, but specifically a *cardboard cutout*.\n5.  **Identify the Role of the Performer:** The cutout is of a *fictional singer*.\n6.  **Review the Episode's Content:** In \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the characters are preparing for their junior prom. Early in the episode, What's Her Face expresses her excitement about the musical guest by saying, \"I can't believe they got a cardboard cutout of K. Loaf to perform at the junior prom.\"\n7.  **Confirm the Name:** Cheerleader then corrects the pronunciation to \"Kuh-loaf,\" but confirms the name itself. Later, a scene shows the prom, and on the stage is a cardboard cutout of a female pop star, clearly labeled \"K. Loaf\".\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The singer, K. Loaf, is a fictional character within the Homestar Runner universe, likely a parody of real-life singer Jennifer Lopez (J.Lo).\n*   **Pronunciation:** The pronunciation is a point of humor in the episode (\"K. Loaf\" vs. \"Kuh-loaf\"), but the written name is consistently \"K. Loaf\".\n*   **Medium:** It is crucial to remember it is a *cardboard cutout* of the singer, not the fictional singer herself, which the question accurately reflects.\n*   **Episode Specificity:** This event occurs specifically in issue #15.\n\nBy following these steps and considering these points, we can confidently identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<K. Loaf>>>"
