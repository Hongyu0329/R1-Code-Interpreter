The product is a ketone with a bicyclo[7.3.0]dodecene skeleton. It is formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement of the starting material, which results in the cleavage of the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene ring and the formation of a new fused 9- and 5-membered ring system. The final product contains a ketone group in the 9-membered ring, a C=C double bond in the 5-membered ring, and retains the TBS ether and dimethoxy ketal functional groups.
