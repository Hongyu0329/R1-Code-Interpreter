    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron:** An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 vertices. A key property is its high degree of symmetry, including a center of inversion symmetry. This means for any point on the icosahedron, there is an identical point on the exact opposite side through the center.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Setup:** The icosahedron tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the equilateral triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank. Because an icosahedron has a parallel face opposite to any given face, there is also an identical triangular face at the top, parallel to the base.\n\n3.  **Interpret \"Half-Filled\":** \"Half-filled\" means the volume of the water occupies exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron. Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, any plane that passes through this geometric center will divide the volume into two equal halves. Since the water surface is always horizontal due to gravity, the water surface of the half-filled tank must be the horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section:** The question is now reduced to finding the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron (oriented on its face) at its center.\n    *   **Symmetry consideration:** The icosahedron, when resting on a face, has a vertical axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. This axis passes through the center of the base triangle, the center of the icosahedron, and the center of the top triangle. Any horizontal cross-section, including the central one, must also have this 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Structural analysis:** Let's consider the edges that the central horizontal plane will intersect. The plane lies exactly halfway in height between the base and the top face. It will not pass through any vertices. Instead, it will cut through the set of edges that form the \"waist\" or \"equator\" of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n    *   When an icosahedron rests on a face, there is a \"belt\" of 6 edges that zig-zag around its equator. These 6 edges connect the 3 vertices closest to the base (but not on the base) to the 3 vertices closest to the top (but not on the top).\n    *   The central horizontal plane intersects each of these 6 equatorial edges. A plane intersecting 6 edges of a polyhedron will form a 6-sided polygon (a hexagon).\n    *   **Regularity of the Hexagon:** Due to the complete symmetry of the icosahedron, these 6 intersected edges are identical in their length and their angle with respect to the vertical axis. The central plane cuts each of these edges at its midpoint. The resulting 6 vertices of the cross-section are all equidistant from the central axis and from each other. This high degree of symmetry dictates that the resulting hexagon must be a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n\n*   The \"half-filled\" condition on a centrally symmetric object implies the water level passes through the center.\n*   The orientation \"standing on a face\" determines the direction of \"horizontal\" and sets up a 3-fold symmetry axis.\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the central cross-section parallel to the base face.\n*   This central plane cuts the 6 \"equatorial\" edges of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n*   Cutting 6 edges produces a hexagon, and the symmetries of the parent icosahedron ensure this hexagon is regular.\n\nThe shape of the water surface will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
