The specific procedures involve a multi-phase approach: 1) Immediate medical management of her uncontrolled diabetes and systemic trauma evaluation, alongside emergency dental care including wound debridement, suturing, and antibiotic/pain management. 2) A healing phase, potentially with a temporary acrylic prosthesis. 3) Definitive treatment with a prosthesis once she is medically stable. The cells of interest are primarily the inflammatory cells (Neutrophils, Macrophages) and reparative cells (Fibroblasts, Osteoblasts, Osteoclasts) involved in wound healing, all of whose function is compromised by her diabetes, as well as the now-necrotic Periodontal Ligament cells from the avulsed teeth.

For denture replacement, the most appropriate choice is a **Cast Metal Frame Removable Partial Denture** made of a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy framework** with **acrylic resin** for the base and teeth. The abutment teeth would be the **Left Central Incisor (#21)**, the **Left Second Premolar (#25)**, and a **Right Molar (e.g., #16)**. This choice is based on the biomechanical principles of providing **Support** (via rests), **Stability** (via cross-arch stabilization to counter occlusal forces from her Class III skeletal pattern), and **Retention** (via clasps), while being a conservative treatment that preserves healthy tooth structure, which is critical for a patient with compromised healing capacity.
