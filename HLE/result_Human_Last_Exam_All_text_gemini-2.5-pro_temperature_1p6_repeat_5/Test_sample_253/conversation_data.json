    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the binary pattern for Cellular Automaton Rule 110 after 20 steps, starting from a single '1' cell.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Rule 110\n\nA cellular automaton consists of a grid of cells, each in a particular state. In a one-dimensional automaton, each cell's next state is determined by its current state and the states of its left and right neighbors. This group of three cells forms a triplet.\n\nRule 110 is defined by the decimal number 110. To use it, we first convert it to its 8-bit binary representation:\n$110_{10} = 01101110_{2}$\n\nThis binary string defines the output for each of the 8 possible triplets. The standard convention (used by Wolfram) maps the triplets from `111` down to `000` to the bits of the binary string from left to right.\n\nHere is the resulting rule table:\n\n| Current Triplet (Left, Center, Right) | Binary Value | New State of Center Cell |\n|:--------------------------------------|:------------:|:------------------------:|\n| `111`                                 |      7       |            `0`           |\n| `110`                                 |      6       |            `1`           |\n| `101`                                 |      5       |            `1`           |\n| `100`                                 |      4       |            `0`           |\n| `011`                                 |      3       |            `1`           |\n| `010`                                 |      2       |            `1`           |\n| `001`                                 |      1       |            `1`           |\n| `000`                                 |      0       |            `0`           |\n\n### Step 2: Define the Initial State and Boundaries\n\nThe automaton starts with a single cell in state `1`. We assume this cell is on an infinite grid of cells in state `0`.\n*   **Generation 0 (t=0):** `...0001000...`\n\nThe pattern will expand outwards. For each new generation, we calculate the state of each cell based on the triplet from the previous generation centered on that cell's position.\n\n### Step 3: Simulate the Automaton Step-by-Step\n\nWe will list the non-zero part of the pattern for each generation.\n\n*   **t=0:** `1`\n*   **t=1:** `11` (From applying the rules to triplets `001` and `010`)\n*   **t=2:** `111` (From `001`, `011`, `110`)\n*   **t=3:** `1101`\n*   **t=4:** `11111`\n*   **t=5:** `110001`\n*   **t=6:** `1110011`\n*   **t=7:** `11010111`\n*   **t=8:** `111111101`\n*   **t=9:** `1100000111`\n*   **t=10:** `1110001101`\n*   **t=11:** `11010011111`\n*   **t=12:** `111110110001`\n*   **t=13:** `1100011110011`\n*   **t=14:** `11100110010111`\n*   **t=15:** `110101110111101`\n*   **t=16:** `111111101110011`\n*   **t=17:** `1100000111010111`\n*   **t=18:** `1110001101111101`\n*   **t=19:** `1101001111100111`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Pattern (Generation 20)\n\nNow, we apply the rules one last time to the pattern from generation 19: `1101001111100111`.\n\nTo find the pattern for t=20, we look at every triplet in the t=19 pattern (including the padding zeros at the edges):\nInput pattern: `...00110100111110011100...`\n\nApplying the rules from our table to each relevant triplet:\n1.  `001` -> `1` (Left edge)\n2.  `011` -> `1`\n3.  `110` -> `1`\n4.  `101` -> `1`\n5.  `010` -> `1`\n6.  `100` -> `0`\n7.  `001` -> `1`\n8.  `011` -> `1`\n9.  `111` -> `0`\n10. `111` -> `0`\n11. `111` -> `0`\n12. `110` -> `1`\n13. `100` -> `0`\n14. `001` -> `1`\n15. `011` -> `1`\n16. `111` -> `0`\n17. `110` -> `1` (Right edge)\n\nAssembling these new states gives the final pattern.\n\nFinal Answer: The binary pattern for generation 20 is `11111011000101101`.\n\n<<<11111011000101101>>>"
