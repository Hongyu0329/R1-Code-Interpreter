    "**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the new output matrix `C_o` when the discrete-time system `x(k+1) = Ax(k)`, `y(k)=Cx(k)` is transformed into the observer canonical form. The problem specifies using the principle of duality.\n\n**2. Principle of Duality**\nDuality connects the observability of a system (A, C) to the controllability of its dual system (A^T, C^T).\n- Original system (S1): `x(k+1) = Ax(k)`, `y(k)=Cx(k)`\n- Dual system (S2): `z(k+1) = A^T z(k) + C^T v(k)`\n\nThe observer canonical form for S1, let's call the matrices (A_o, C_o), is related to the controllable canonical form of S2, let's call the matrices (A_c, B_c), by the following relations:\n`A_o = A_c^T`\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the input matrix `B_c` for the controllable canonical form of the dual system (A^T, C^T).\n\n**3. Define the Dual System**\nFirst, we find the matrices for the dual system:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]` -> `A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]` -> `B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\nThe dual system is a multi-input system, as `B_d` has two columns. Let's name them `b1` and `b2`:\n`b1 = [0, 1, 0]^T`\n`b2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`\n\n**4. Check Controllability and Find Controllability Indices**\nTo find a controllable canonical form, we must first verify that the dual system is controllable. We build the controllability matrix `W_c = [b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...]`. We need to find `n=3` linearly independent vectors.\n\n- `b1 = [0, 1, 0]^T` (Linearly Independent - LI)\n- `b2 = [1, 1, 0]^T` (LI with respect to `b1`)\n- `A_d*b1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T`. We check if this is LI with respect to `{b1, b2}`. The third component is 1, while any linear combination of `b1` and `b2` has a zero in the third component. Thus, `A_d*b1` is LI.\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors: `{b1, b2, A_d*b1}`. The system is controllable.\n\nThe controllability indices `(μ1, μ2)` are determined by how many vectors we selected from each input's chain.\n- From `b1`'s chain, we selected `{b1, A_d*b1}`, so `μ1 = 2`.\n- From `b2`'s chain, we selected `{b2}`, so `μ2 = 1`.\nThe controllability indices are `{2, 1}`.\n\n**5. Construct the Transformation to Controllable Canonical Form**\nA standard method to transform a system into a controllable canonical form (specifically, the Luenberger form) is to define a new basis using the linearly independent vectors found in the previous step. The transformation matrix `P` is the inverse of the matrix formed by these basis vectors.\n\nLet the matrix of new basis vectors be `Q = [b1, A_d*b1, b2]`. Note the ordering which is standard for the Luenberger form.\n`Q = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe transformation matrix `P` that transforms the state from the original basis to the new canonical basis is `P = Q^-1`. The new state `z_c` is `z_c = P*z`.\nThe input matrix in the new coordinates, `B_c`, is given by `B_c = P * B_d`.\n\n**6. Determine the Canonical Input Matrix `B_c`**\n`B_c = P * B_d = P * [b1, b2] = [P*b1, P*b2]`\n\nWe can calculate `P*b1` and `P*b2` without explicitly calculating the inverse matrix `P=Q^-1`.\nBy definition, `P*Q = I` (Identity matrix).\n- `P*b1`: Since `b1` is the first column of `Q`, `Q*e1 = b1` (where `e1 = [1,0,0]^T`). Multiplying by `P` on the left gives `P*Q*e1 = P*b1`, which simplifies to `I*e1 = P*b1`, so `P*b1 = e1 = [1, 0, 0]^T`.\n- `P*b2`: Since `b2` is the third column of `Q`, `Q*e3 = b2` (where `e3 = [0,0,1]^T`). Multiplying by `P` gives `P*Q*e3 = P*b2`, which simplifies to `I*e3 = P*b2`, so `P*b2 = e3 = [0, 0, 1]^T`.\n\nCombining these results, we get the canonical input matrix `B_c`:\n`B_c = [e1, e3] = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n**7. Find the Final Answer `C_o`**\nUsing the duality principle, the new output matrix `C_o` for the observer canonical form is the transpose of `B_c`.\n`C_o = B_c^T = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThis is the output matrix for the observer canonical form corresponding to the observability indices `{2, 1}`.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
