    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define the Terms\n\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" given specific values from an interval type-3 fuzzy system. Let's break down the components:\n\n1.  **Fuzzy Rule:** In a fuzzy logic system, a rule has the structure \"IF (antecedent) THEN (consequent)\". For example, `Rule k: IF input x is A_k THEN output y is G_k`.\n2.  **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: This represents the firing strength or firing level of the antecedent part of the *k*-th rule for a specific input `x'`. It tells us the degree to which the \"IF\" condition of the rule is met. Let's denote this as `f_k = 0.7`.\n3.  **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This is the membership grade of a specific point `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k`. This represents the membership value in the output set *before* considering the rule's firing strength.\n4.  **Rule Activation Level**: This term refers to the result of the implication process, where the firing strength of the antecedent (`f_k`) is used to modify the consequent fuzzy set (`G_k`). This process determines the output fuzzy set for that specific rule.\n5.  **T-norm Operation**: A t-norm is a mathematical function that models a fuzzy logical AND. In the context of Mamdani-style fuzzy inference (which is the most common), the implication step is performed using a t-norm to combine the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function. This effectively \"clips\" or \"scales\" the consequent set.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n\n1.  **Simplification:** An Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS) is highly complex. In a true IT3 system, the firing level `Phi_k(x')` and the consequent membership `μG_k_j(y_j)` would themselves be Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2 FSs), not single numbers. The problem provides single crisp values (0.7 and 0.9), which drastically simplifies the calculation to a Type-1 level. We can assume these values are representative points (e.g., points on the upper bounds of the respective membership functions) to allow for a direct calculation.\n2.  **Choice of T-norm:** The problem specifies using a \"t-norm\" but does not state which one. The two most common t-norms used for fuzzy implication are:\n    *   **Minimum (min) t-norm:** `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   **Product (prod) t-norm:** `t(a, b) = a * b`\n    In the absence of a specific instruction, the **minimum** t-norm is the standard and most widely used for Mamdani implication. It corresponds to clipping the consequent fuzzy set at the height of the antecedent firing level. We will proceed using the `min` operator.\n3.  **Interpretation of \"Rule Activation Level\"**: This phrase refers to the resulting membership value of the point `y_j` in the *output* of the rule after the implication step has been applied. It is not just the antecedent firing level (`0.7`) but the result of combining the firing level with the original consequent membership (`0.9`).\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe process is to apply the chosen t-norm to the two given values.\n\n1.  **Identify the Antecedent Firing Level:**\n    `f_k = Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n\n2.  **Identify the Original Consequent Membership Grade:**\n    `μ = μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\n3.  **Select the Implication Operator:** We will use the standard `min` t-norm for Mamdani implication.\n    `Activation Level = t(f_k, μ) = min(f_k, μ)`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Value:**\n    The minimum of 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n\nTherefore, the resulting membership grade of the point `y_j` in the rule's output set (i.e., the rule activation level at that point) is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
