    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis, two linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2$. We can write these vectors as columns of a matrix $M = [v_1 | v_2]$. Since $v_1, v_2$ are linearly independent, $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe \"area\" of the lattice is the area of the fundamental parallelogram spanned by its basis vectors. This is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The problem states that the lattices have unit area, so $|\\det(M)|=1$. Let's call the set of such matrices $GL_2^\\pm(\\mathbb{R}) = \\{M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(M) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\nThe \"moduli space\" $X$ consists of the lattices themselves, not their bases. Two bases $M_1$ and $M_2$ generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $M_2 = M_1 A$.\nTherefore, the space $X$ is the quotient space of all possible unit-area bases by this equivalence relation:\n$X = GL_2^\\pm(\\mathbb{R}) / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate X to a quotient of the upper half-plane**\nA standard way to study the space of lattices is by associating each lattice with a unique geometric object. We can associate a lattice $\\Lambda$ with a positive-definite quadratic form, represented by its Gram matrix.\nLet $M \\in GL_2^\\pm(\\mathbb{R})$ be a basis for a lattice $\\Lambda$. The Gram matrix is $Q = M^T M$.\nProperties of $Q$:\n1.  $Q$ is symmetric: $Q^T = (M^T M)^T = M^T (M^T)^T = M^T M = Q$.\n2.  $Q$ is positive definite: for any non-zero vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, $x^T Q x = x^T M^T M x = (Mx)^T(Mx) = \\|Mx\\|^2 > 0$ since $M$ is invertible.\n3.  $Q$ has determinant 1: $\\det(Q) = \\det(M^T M) = \\det(M^T)\\det(M) = (\\det(M))^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}$ be the space of symmetric positive-definite $2 \\times 2$ matrices with determinant 1. If we choose a different basis $M' = MA$ for the same lattice (with $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$), the corresponding Gram matrix is $Q' = (MA)^T(MA) = A^T M^T M A = A^T Q A$.\nThe map from $GL_2^\\pm(\\mathbb{R})$ to $\\mathcal{P}$ given by $M \\mapsto M^TM$ induces a bijection between the space of lattices $X$ and the space of orbits of $\\mathcal{P}$ under the action $Q \\mapsto A^T Q A$ for $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. So, $X \\cong \\mathcal{P} / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe space $\\mathcal{P}$ is known to be homeomorphic to the hyperbolic upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\mathrm{Im}(z) > 0\\}$. A common homeomorphism sends $z=x+iy \\in \\mathcal{H}$ to the matrix $\\frac{1}{y}\\begin{pmatrix} x^2+y^2 & x \\\\ x & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathcal{P}$.\n\nThe action of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathcal{P}$ translates to an action on $\\mathcal{H}$.\n-   For $A \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, the action $Q \\mapsto A^TQA$ corresponds to the standard action of $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$ on $\\mathcal{H}$ by Mobius transformations: $z \\mapsto \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$.\n-   For $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(A)=-1$, the action corresponds to an anti-holomorphic isometry on $\\mathcal{H}$. For example, if we take $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, its action on $\\mathcal{H}$ corresponds to the map $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$.\n\nThe full group of transformations on $\\mathcal{H}$ induced by the action of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathcal{P}$ is generated by $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ and the map $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$. This group, let's call it $G^*$, is isomorphic to $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) = GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$.\nSo we have established a homeomorphism $X \\cong \\mathcal{H} / PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the first homology group**\nThe space $X$ is an orbifold. The first integral homology group of an orbifold is the abelianization of its orbifold fundamental group.\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\pi_1^{orb}(X))^{ab}$.\nFor a quotient orbifold of the form $\\mathcal{U}/G$ where $\\mathcal{U}$ is a simply-connected universal cover, the orbifold fundamental group is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations $G$. Here, $\\mathcal{H}$ is the universal cover of the orbifold $X$, and the group of deck transformations is $G^* \\cong PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nSo, $\\pi_1^{orb}(X) \\cong PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nWe need to compute the abelianization of $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the abelianization of PGL₂(ℤ)**\nThe abelianization of a group $G$ is the quotient group $G/[G,G]$, where $[G,G]$ is the commutator subgroup.\nFor a quotient group $G/N$, its abelianization is $(G/N)^{ab} \\cong G^{ab} / \\bar{N}$, where $\\bar{N}$ is the image of $N$ under the abelianization map $G \\to G^{ab}$.\nIn our case, $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) = GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) / Z$, where $Z = \\{\\pm I\\}$ is the center of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. We first compute the abelianization of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe abelianization of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is known to be $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. This can be shown by constructing a surjective homomorphism from $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$ whose kernel is the commutator subgroup. This homomorphism $\\phi: GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\{ \\pm 1\\} \\times \\{ \\pm 1\\} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$ is given by\n$\\phi(A) = (\\det(A), \\text{sign}(\\pi(A)))$, where $\\pi: GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong S_3$ is the reduction modulo 2 map, and $\\text{sign}$ is the signature of a permutation.\nSo, $(GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\n\nNow we must find the image of the center $Z = \\{\\pm I\\}$ in this abelianization. The generator of $Z$ is $-I$.\n$\\det(-I) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1$.\nThe reduction modulo 2 of $-I$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$, which is the identity element in $S_3$. Its sign is 1.\nSo, $\\phi(-I) = (1,1)$, which is the identity element in $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\nThe image of the center $Z$ in $(GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))^{ab}$ is the trivial subgroup.\n\nTherefore, the abelianization of $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is:\n$(PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))^{ab} \\cong (GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))^{ab} / \\overline{Z} \\cong ((\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2) / \\{id\\} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\n\nThe first homology group is isomorphic to this abelianization.\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$."
