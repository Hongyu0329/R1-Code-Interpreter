    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above the prime 2, we need to analyze the geometry of the curve over a 2-adic field. The thickness is an integer invariant of the singularity in the special fiber of the stable model.\n\n**Step 1: Find a suitable model for the curve.**\nThe given equation is $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. Let $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This model is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Its special fiber, obtained by reducing modulo 2, is $z^2 = 1$, or $(z-1)^2 = 0$. This is a non-reduced, singular fiber.\n\nTo better understand the geometry of the branch points, we consider a birationally equivalent model. Let $x = 1/u$ and $z = w/u^3$. This transformation takes the point at infinity on the $x$-line to a finite point.\nSubstituting into the equation:\n$(w/u^3)^2 = 2(1/u)^5 + 2(1/u)^3 + 1$\n$w^2/u^6 = (2 + 2u^2 + u^5)/u^5$\n$w^2 = u(2 + 2u^2 + u^5) = u^6 + 2u^3 + 2u$.\n\nSo, the curve $C$ is birationally equivalent to the curve $C'$ defined by the equation $w^2 = g(u)$, where $g(u) = u^6 + 2u^3 + 2u$. Since stable reduction is an invariant of the birational equivalence class of the curve, we can work with this model $C'$. The polynomial $g(u)$ is of degree 6, which is typical for a genus 2 curve. The branch points of the map $(u,w) \\mapsto u$ are the roots of $g(u)=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the branch points over a suitable 2-adic field.**\nWe are working with the valuation $v=v_2$, normalized by $v(2)=1$.\nThe polynomial defining the branch points is $g(u) = u^6 + 2u^3 + 2u = u(u^5 + 2u^2 + 2)$.\nOne branch point is $u_1=0$.\nThe other five branch points are the roots of the polynomial $h(u) = u^5 + 2u^2 + 2 = 0$.\n\nLet's find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $h(u)$ using the Newton polygon method. The coefficients of $h(u)$ are $c_5=1, c_2=2, c_0=2$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v(c_i))$:\n- For $c_5=1$, we have the point $(5, v(1)) = (5,0)$.\n- For $c_2=2$, we have the point $(2, v(2)) = (2,1)$.\n- For $c_0=2$, we have the point $(0, v(2)) = (0,1)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points is the single line segment connecting $(0,1)$ and $(5,0)$.\nThe slope of this segment is $m = \\frac{0-1}{5-0} = -1/5$.\nAccording to the theory of Newton polygons, there are 5 roots of $h(u)$ and they all have the 2-adic valuation $v(\\text{root}) = -m = -(-1/5) = 1/5$.\n\n**Step 3: Work over an appropriate field extension.**\nThe valuations of the roots are fractional, which means the roots lie in a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The denominator of the valuation is 5, so we need an extension with a ramification index $e$ that is a multiple of 5. Let's work in the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$ where $\\pi^5=2$. This is a totally ramified extension of degree 5.\nThe valuation on $K$, let's call it $v_K$, is normalized so that $v_K(\\pi)=1$. The relation to the original valuation is $v_K(x) = 5v(x)$.\nIn this new valuation, we have $v_K(2) = 5v(2) = 5$.\nThe roots $\\beta_i$ of $h(u)=0$ have $v(\\beta_i)=1/5$, so $v_K(\\beta_i) = 5 \\cdot (1/5) = 1$. This means each $\\beta_i$ is a uniformizer times a unit in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of $K$.\nThe branch points of $C'$ are $u_1=0$ and the roots $\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5$ of $h(u)=0$.\nTheir valuations are $v_K(0) = \\infty$ and $v_K(\\beta_i) = 1$ for $i=1,\\dots,5$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable reduction and calculate the thickness.**\nThe set of branch points $B=\\{0, \\beta_1, ..., \\beta_5\\}$ is partitioned into two \"clusters\" based on their valuations: $B_1 = \\{0\\}$ and $B_2 = \\{\\beta_1, ..., \\beta_5\\}$.\nThe theory of stable reduction for hyperelliptic curves states that such a partition leads to a special fiber of the stable model consisting of two components, say $E_1$ and $E_2$, corresponding to the clusters $B_1$ and $B_2$. The two components intersect at one or more nodes. In this case, since one cluster has only one point, the components intersect at a single ordinary double point (node).\nThe thickness of this double point, which we denote by $m$, can be calculated using a formula involving the resultants of the polynomials whose roots form the clusters.\nLet $g(u) = f_1(u)f_2(u)$, where $f_1(u)=u$ has roots $B_1$ and $f_2(u)=u^5+2u^2+2$ has roots $B_2$.\nThe formula is:\n$v_K(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2)) = m \\cdot (\\deg f_1) \\cdot (\\deg f_2)$.\nThis formula is applicable if the valuation of the difference between any root of $f_1$ and any root of $f_2$ is constant.\nThe only root of $f_1$ is $\\alpha=0$. The roots of $f_2$ are $\\beta_i$.\nThe valuation of their differences is $v_K(\\alpha - \\beta_i) = v_K(-\\beta_i) = v_K(\\beta_i) = 1$. Since this value is constant for all $\\beta_i$, the formula applies.\n\nLet's compute the resultant:\n$\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2) = \\text{Res}(u, u^5+2u^2+2)$.\nThe resultant is obtained by evaluating the second polynomial at the root of the first polynomial, which is $u=0$.\n$\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2) = 0^5+2(0)^2+2 = 2$.\n\nNow, we compute the valuation of the resultant:\n$v_K(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2)) = v_K(2) = 5$.\n\nPlugging this into the formula for the thickness $m$:\n$5 = m \\cdot (\\deg u) \\cdot (\\deg(u^5+2u^2+2)) = m \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5$.\n$5 = 5m$.\nThis gives $m=1$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is an integer, and our calculation yields an integer result, which is a good sign. The calculation relies on standard formulas from the theory of arithmetic geometry.\n\nFinal Answer: The thickness of the double point of the stable reduction is 1."
