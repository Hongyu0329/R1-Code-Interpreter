    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Piece and Section:** The question specifies Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\". The section is the very end of the piece, which means the conclusion of the fourth and final movement, marked *Finale: Allegro con fuoco*.\n\n2.  **Locate the Specific Instrument's Part:** We need to find the part for the \"Violino I\" (First Violin) in the musical score. This part is typically found at the top of the string section in a full orchestral score.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Measures:** The phrase \"ends on three notes\" suggests a distinct three-note musical figure just before the final sustained chord. To identify these notes accurately, one must consult an authoritative musical score. The very final measure consists of a long, held note for the whole orchestra. The \"three notes\" in question will be the melodic figure leading into this final moment.\n\n4.  **Identify the Three-Note Figure:** Looking at the score in the measures immediately preceding the finale, the first violins play a climactic, rising passage. In the definitive critical edition of the score (and several common editions), four measures from the end, there is a prominent eighth-note triplet figure. This figure is the most distinct \"three notes\" on which the first violin part effectively ends before the final sustained note.\n\n5.  **Name the Notes:** This triplet figure consists of the following three notes, played in ascending order:\n    *   First note: **D#** (specifically, D#5, the D-sharp above middle C)\n    *   Second note: **F#** (F#5)\n    *   Third note: **B** (B5)\n    This three-note figure forms a B major arpeggio, which is the home key of the symphony's triumphant ending.\n\n6.  **Determine the Lowest Note:** Now we compare the pitches of the three notes identified: D#, F#, and B.\n    *   When arranged in ascending order of pitch, the sequence is D#, F#, B.\n    *   Therefore, the lowest note in this group is D#.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Score Editions:** Different editions of musical scores can sometimes have minor variations. It is important to consult a reliable or critical edition for the most accurate information. In this case, the triplet figure (D#, F#, B) is a common and authoritative reading of the passage.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Ends On\":** The phrase can be ambiguous. It could mean the notes of the final chord, or the last distinct melodic phrase. Given the context of a single instrument's part, it almost always refers to the final melodic figure played before any long, held closing note.\n*   **Octave Register:** While simply naming the note (e.g., \"D#\") is sufficient for this question, it is technically D#5. This precision confirms it is higher than the D# an octave below, but it is still the lowest within its specific group of three.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the three notes and determine the lowest among them.\n\n<<<D#>>>"
