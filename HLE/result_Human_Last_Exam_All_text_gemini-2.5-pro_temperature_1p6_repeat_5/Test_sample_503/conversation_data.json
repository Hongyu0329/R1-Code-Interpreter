    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[m]$ to $[n]$ can be understood through the lens of order theory, as $\\Delta$ is a 2-category where the 2-morphisms are defined by the pointwise order on morphisms.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category**\n\n*   **Objects (0-cells):** The objects are the finite ordinals $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   **Morphisms (1-cells):** For two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$, a morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., a function such that if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-Morphisms (2-cells):** For two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. This makes the hom-set $\\text{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$ a poset, and $\\Delta$ a locally posetal 2-category.\n\n**Step 2: Defining an internal adjunction in this context**\n\nAn adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of:\n1.  A pair of morphisms (1-cells): a left adjoint $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and a right adjoint $g: [n] \\to [m]$.\n2.  A unit and a counit (2-cells):\n    *   The unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[m]} \\to g \\circ f$, which translates to the inequality $\\text{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. This simplifies to $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n    *   The counit $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\text{id}_{[n]}$, which translates to the inequality $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[n]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [n]$. This simplifies to $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThese two conditions, for order-preserving maps $f$ and $g$, define what is known as a **monotone Galois connection** between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterizing adjoint maps**\n\nAn important theorem in order theory states that for a map between complete lattices, the existence of a right (or left) adjoint is equivalent to the preservation of certain properties. The posets $[k]$ are finite and totally ordered, hence they are complete lattices.\n*   A map $f: P \\to Q$ between complete lattices has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins).\n*   A map $g: Q \\to P$ between complete lattices has a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\nLet's apply this to $f: [m] \\to [n]$.\nFor any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, its supremum is its maximum element, $\\max(S)$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, it can be shown that $f(\\max(S)) = \\max(f(S))$. So, $f$ preserves all non-empty suprema.\nHowever, we must also consider the empty set, $\\emptyset$. In a poset $[k]$, the supremum of the empty set is the least element, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$. For $f$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve this supremum:\n$f(\\sup_{[m]}(\\emptyset)) = \\sup_{[n]}(f(\\emptyset))$.\nThis means $f(0) = \\sup_{[n]}(\\emptyset) = 0$.\nThus, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint (i.e., has a right adjoint) if and only if **$f(0) = 0$**.\n\nDually, for $g: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint (i.e., have a left adjoint), it must preserve all infima. In a poset $[k]$, the infimum of the empty set is the greatest element, $\\inf(\\emptyset) = k$.\nThe condition $g(\\inf_{[n]}(\\emptyset)) = \\inf_{[m]}(g(\\emptyset))$ becomes $g(n) = m$.\nThus, an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if **$g(n) = m$**.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the adjunctions**\n\nThe number of adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is the number of pairs $(f, g)$ satisfying the conditions. Since the adjoint is unique if it exists, this is the same as the number of left adjoints $f: [m] \\to [n]$ or the number of right adjoints $g: [n] \\to [m]$. Let's count the number of left adjoints.\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of 24 values: $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$, such that $0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first term. So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 values from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $37 - 0 + 1 = 38$ elements, with replacement, and the order is fixed (non-decreasing).\nThis is a problem of choosing a multiset of size $k=23$ from a set of size $N=38$. The formula is:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n**Step 5: Verification (optional)**\n\nWe can also count the number of right adjoints $g: [37] \\to [23]$. Such maps must satisfy $g(37)=23$.\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $g$ defined by a sequence $g(0), \\dots, g(37)$ such that $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(37) \\le 23$ and $g(37)=23$.\nThis reduces to counting non-decreasing sequences of length 37:\n$0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$.\nHere, we are choosing a multiset of size $k=37$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $N=24$ elements.\nThe number is:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we can see that $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The two counts match, confirming our reasoning.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is therefore $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial[60, 23]>>>"
