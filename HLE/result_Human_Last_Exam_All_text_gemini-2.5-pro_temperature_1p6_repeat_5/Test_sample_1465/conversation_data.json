    "This problem requires analyzing five amino acid sequences to determine their likely oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.). These sequences are designed as coiled-coils, whose structure is primarily determined by a repeating seven-residue pattern called a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The identity of amino acids at specific positions within this repeat dictates how the helices pack together.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis & Careful Points:**\n\n**1. Identifying the Heptad Register:**\n*   **Careful Point:** The most crucial step is to correctly identify the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are the most important as they form the buried hydrophobic core. `e` and `g` are typically charged or polar and form inter-helical electrostatic interactions.\n*   **Method:** We will test possible registers to find one where positions `a` and `d` are consistently occupied by hydrophobic residues (like I, L, V, A, M, F, Y, W) or specific polar residues known to influence oligomerization (N, Q, T). A common design frame for sequences starting with a charged residue like Glutamic Acid (E) is the `gabcdef` register, where the first residue is at position `g`. We will use this as our working hypothesis.\n\n**2. Analyzing Each Sequence:**\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown (`gabcdef` register):**\n    *   `EIAQALK`: `g=E, a=I, b=A, c=Q, d=A, e=L, f=K`\n    *   `EIAKALK`: `g=E, a=I, b=A, c=K, d=A, e=L, f=K`\n    *   `EIAWALK`: `g=E, a=I, b=A, c=W, d=A, e=L, f=K` (Note: Here W is at `c`, not `d`) Let's re-read the sequence: It's `EIAWALK`, so `W` is at `d`. Wait, no, `g=E, a=I, b=A, c=W, d=A, e=L, f=K`. My mistake. Let's read the sequence from the problem again: `EIAWALK`. Ok.\n    `g a b c d e f`\n    `E I A W A L K` -> `d` is `W`. Okay, let's proceed with this.\n*   **Breakdown Re-check:**\n    *   `EIAQALK` -> `a=I, d=A`\n    *   `EIAKALK` -> `a=I, d=A`\n    *   `EIAWALK` -> `a=I, d=W`\n    *   `EIAQALK` -> `a=I, d=A`\n*   **Core Analysis:** The core is composed of `Ia-Ad` pairs (three times) and one `Ia-Wd` pair.\n    *   `Ia-Ad` packing is a classic motif that strongly favors a **trimeric** (3-helix) coiled-coil. The small Alanine (A) at `d` under-packs a dimeric interface but fits well in the tighter trimeric one.\n    *   However, let's consider the `e` and `g` positions: `g=E` (negative charge), `e` positions are `L, L, L, K`. In a parallel trimer, the `g` positions would feature strong `E-E` repulsion, and one layer of `e` positions would have `K-K` repulsion. This electrostatic repulsion can destabilize a trimer.\n*   **Conclusion:** The core (`Ia-Ad`) strongly suggests a trimer, but the repulsive electrostatics at `g` and `e` favor a lower oligomeric state. In such competing cases, repulsive forces can dominate, favoring a **dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown (`gabcdef` register):** A simple 4x7 breakdown does not fit the sequence `...KKENA...`. We must align based on the repeating motif.\n    *   Heptad 1: `EIAALKQ` -> `a=I, d=L`\n    *   Heptad 2: `EIAALKK` -> `a=I, d=L`\n    *   Heptad 3: `ENAALKQ` -> `a=N, d=L`\n    *   Heptad 4: `EIAALKQ` -> `a=I, d=L`\n*   **Core Analysis:** The core pairs are `Ia-Ld` and `Na-Ld`.\n    *   `Ia-Ld` packing is a canonical motif for **dimers**.\n    *   `Na-Ld` contains a polar Asparagine (N) at the core `a` position. This is a very powerful oligomerization determinant. The `N` residues from two parallel helices can form a hydrogen bond across the interface, strongly specifying and stabilizing a **dimer (2)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is unambiguously a **dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown (`gabcdef` register):** Based on the pattern, this breaks down into:\n    *   `EIAAIKQ`: `a=I, d=I`\n    *   `EIAAIKK`: `a=I, d=I`\n    *   `EIAAIKW`: `a=I, d=I`\n    *   `EIAAIKQ`: `a=I, d=I`\n*   **Core Analysis:** The core is composed entirely of `Ia-Id` pairs.\n    *   Isoleucine (I) is β-branched. Placing it at both `a` and `d` positions creates steric hindrance in a dimer. This packing strain is relieved in trimers. Thus, `Ia-Id` is a strong **trimer** motif.\n    *   However, experimental studies in protein design have shown that parallel coiled-coils with `Ia-Id` cores and favorable `g-e` electrostatic interactions (`g=E`, `e=K` in this sequence) can form stable **tetramers (4)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** While trimer is a possibility, the specific combination of an `Ia-Id` core and `E-K` electrostatics is a known design for a **tetramer (4)**.\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown (`gabcdef` register):**\n    *   The sequence is a repeat of `EIQKQLK`, with `W` substituting for `K` at position `c` in one heptad (`EIQWQLK`).\n    *   Let's check the register: `g=E, a=I, b=Q, c=K, d=Q, e=L, f=K`. This places the polar Glutamine (Q) at the core `d` position.\n*   **Core Analysis:** The core is `Ia-Qd`.\n    *   Similar to Asparagine (N) at a core position, Glutamine (Q) can form a \"polar zipper.\" The glutamine side chains from two helices form hydrogen bonds across the dimeric interface. This is a very strong determinant.\n*   **Conclusion:** The `Q` at the `d` position strongly specifies a **dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Heptad Breakdown (`gabcdef` register):**\n    *   The structure is repetitive: `EIA(Q/K/W)TLK`.\n    *   Registering gives: `g=E, a=I, d=T`.\n*   **Core Analysis:** The core is `Ia-Td`.\n    *   Threonine (T) is a β-branched polar amino acid. Like Isoleucine, its β-branching creates steric clashes that disfavor dimerization.\n    *   The packing of `Ia-Td` is known to be optimal in a **trimer (3)**. Furthermore, the polar hydroxyl (-OH) groups of the threonine residues can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network along the central axis of the trimer.\n*   **Conclusion:** The `Ia-Td` core is a robust signal for a **trimer (3)**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Sequence 1: **2** (Dimer) - Core prefers trimer, but repulsive electrostatics likely favor dimer.\n*   Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer) - The `N` at the core `a` position is a definitive feature.\n*   Sequence 3: **4** (Tetramer) - `Ia-Id` core with `E-K` electrostatics is a known tetramer design.\n*   Sequence 4: **2** (Dimer) - The `Q` at the core `d` position is a definitive feature.\n*   Sequence 5: **3** (Trimer) - `Ia-Td` core is a classic trimer motif stabilized by H-bonding.\n\nThe resulting oligomeric states are **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
