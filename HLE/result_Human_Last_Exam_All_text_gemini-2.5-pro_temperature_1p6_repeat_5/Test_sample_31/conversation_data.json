    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify any PLL case, we need to find the smallest amount of information that uniquely distinguishes each of the 21 PLL cases (plus the solved state) from all others.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    *   **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):** The final step of the CFOP method. At this stage, the top face is all one color (e.g., yellow), but the side pieces of the top layer are not yet in their final positions.\n    *   **Goal:** Permute the 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces of the top layer without disturbing their orientation (i.e., yellow stays on top).\n    *   **Information Source:** The only information available to distinguish between PLL cases comes from the side stickers of the top layer. There are 4 corners (each with 2 side stickers) and 4 edges (each with 1 side sticker), for a total of 12 side stickers.\n    *   **The Question:** What is the minimum number of these 12 stickers we must observe to know exactly which of the 22 possible states (21 PLLs + solved) we have?\n\n2.  **An Information-Theoretic Approach (using Piece Identity):**\n    The core of the problem is determining the permutation of the 8 pieces (4 corners, 4 edges). If we can determine where each piece goes, we have identified the PLL.\n    *   To know the identity of a corner piece (e.g., to know this is the Front-Right-Top corner), we must see both of its side stickers. This costs **2 stickers**.\n    *   To know the identity of an edge piece (e.g., to know this is the Front-Top edge), we must see its single side sticker. This costs **1 sticker**.\n\n3.  **The Parity Constraint:**\n    A crucial rule in Rubik's Cube permutations is that of parity. For any legal move sequence, the parity of the corner permutation must match the parity of the edge permutation.\n    *   An *even* permutation can be made of an even number of swaps (e.g., a 3-cycle).\n    *   An *odd* permutation can be made of an odd number of swaps (e.g., a single swap).\n    *   The rule is: `parity(corner permutation) = parity(edge permutation)`. So, `(even, even)` and `(odd, odd)` permutations are possible, but `(even, odd)` and `(odd, even)` are not.\n\n4.  **Testing Sticker Sufficiency:**\n    Let's test the minimum number of stickers by determining how many pieces we need to identify to remove any ambiguity. Ambiguity exists if the remaining, unidentified pieces can form a valid, non-trivial PLL among themselves.\n\n    *   **Is 6 stickers enough?**\n        With 6 stickers, we could, for example, identify **2 corners** (2\\*2=4 stickers) and **2 edges** (2\\*1=2 stickers).\n        *   **Identified:** 2 corners, 2 edges.\n        *   **Unidentified:** 2 corners, 2 edges.\n        Can these 4 unidentified pieces form a valid PLL? Yes. For example, a **T-perm** swaps 2 corners and 2 edges. The corner permutation is odd (1 swap), and the edge permutation is odd (1 swap). The parities match, so this is a valid ambiguity. We cannot be sure if the remaining pieces are solved or in a T-perm.\n        *   Therefore, 6 stickers is **not sufficient**.\n\n    *   **Are 7 stickers enough?**\n        With 7 stickers, we can identify **2 corners** (4 stickers) and **3 edges** (3 stickers).\n        *   **Identified:** 2 corners, 3 edges.\n        *   **Unidentified:** 2 corners, 1 edge.\n        Can these 3 unidentified pieces form a valid PLL?\n        1.  The single unidentified edge must go into the single remaining edge slot. So, the edge permutation must be the identity (which is *even*).\n        2.  For a valid PLL, the corner permutation must also be *even*.\n        3.  The two unidentified corners can either be in their correct places (identity, an even permutation) or be swapped. A single swap is an *odd* permutation.\n        4.  Since an odd corner permutation (a swap) cannot be paired with an even edge permutation (identity), the only possibility is the identity permutation for the corners.\n        5.  Therefore, there is no ambiguity. The state of the remaining 3 pieces is forced.\n        *   This proves that 7 stickers are **sufficient**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since 6 stickers are insufficient and 7 are sufficient, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
