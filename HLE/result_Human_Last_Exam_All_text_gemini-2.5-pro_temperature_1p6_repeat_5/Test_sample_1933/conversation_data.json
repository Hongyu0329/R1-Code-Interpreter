    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. These are the fundamental building blocks of our formulas.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This denotes a fragment of First-Order Logic.\n    *   The formulas are built using only the predicates from $S$.\n    *   The allowed logical symbols are the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), the logical constant true ($\\top$), and the logical constant false ($\\bot$).\n    *   We are interested in formulas with one free variable, let's say $\\phi(x)$, which act as classifiers on the elements of a model's universe. For an element $a$, the classification is positive if the model satisfies $\\phi(a)$, and negative otherwise.\n*   **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension of a class of classifiers (our formulas) is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the class. A set of points $X$ is shattered if for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi(x)$ in our class that is true for all points in $Y$ and false for all points in $X \\setminus Y$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of Formulas\n\nLet's analyze what a typical formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment looks like. A formula is constructed by applying conjunctions and existential quantifiers to atomic formulas ($P_i(z)$ for some variable $z$) and the constants $\\top, \\bot$.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ can be simplified. A general formula is of the form $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. We can separate the conjuncts in $\\psi$ based on which variable they contain.\n\n$\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\text{conj_x}(x) \\land \\text{conj_y}(\\vec{y})$\n\nHere, `conj_x(x)` is a conjunction of all atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$, e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. The term `conj_y(y)` is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving only the existentially quantified variables.\n\nSo, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\text{conj_x}(x) \\land \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k (\\text{conj_y}(\\vec{y}))$\n\nThe part $\\exists \\vec{y} (\\text{conj_y}(\\vec{y}))$ is a sentence, as it has no free variables. Its truth value depends only on the model, not on the specific element being assigned to $x$. Let's call this sentence $C$.\n\nSo, any formula $\\phi(x)$ in our language is equivalent to one of the form:\n$\\psi(x) \\land C$\nwhere $\\psi(x)$ is a pure conjunction of some of the atomic predicates $\\{P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)\\}$, and $C$ is a sentence.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Effective Hypothesis Class\n\nWhen we want to find the VC dimension, we are allowed to choose the model. For a fixed model $\\mathcal{M}$, the sentence $C$ is either true or false.\n1.  If $\\mathcal{M} \\models C$, then $\\phi(x)$ behaves exactly like $\\psi(x)$.\n2.  If $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models C$, then $\\phi(x)$ behaves exactly like $\\bot$ (it's always false).\n\nThe formulas $\\top$ and $\\bot$ are also in our language. $\\top$ selects all points, and $\\bot$ selects no points.\n\nTo shatter a set, we need maximum expressive power. We can achieve this by considering the class of classifiers formed by pure conjunctions of the base predicates. For any complex formula $\\phi(x) = \\psi(x) \\land C$, we can design our model $\\mathcal{M}$ such that $C$ is true (by adding \"witness\" elements to the universe if necessary). Thus, the full language does not offer more classification power on a carefully chosen set than the simpler class of pure conjunctions.\n\nOur effective class of hypotheses $\\mathcal{H}$ corresponds to all possible conjunctions of the four predicates $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. This includes the empty conjunction, which is equivalent to $\\top$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the concept class formed by taking intersections of 4 base sets (the extensions of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$).\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nThe number of distinct hypotheses in our effective class $\\mathcal{H}$ is the number of ways to form a conjunction from four predicates. This is the number of subsets of $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$, which is $2^4 = 16$.\nA well-known result in learning theory states that for any finite hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$, its VC dimension is bounded by $\\mathrm{VCD}(\\mathcal{H}) \\le \\log_2(|\\mathcal{H}|)$.\nIn our case, $\\mathrm{VCD}(\\mathcal{H}) \\le \\log_2(16) = 4$.\nSo, the VC dimension can be at most 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered. We need to construct a model (a universe and predicate interpretations) where this is possible.\n*   **Universe**: Let the universe contain a set of 4 points, $X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$.\n*   **Predicate Interpretations**: We define the extensions of our four predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on the set $X$. Let $S_i$ be the set of points where $P_i$ is true. We define them as follows:\n    *   $S_1 = X \\setminus \\{a_1\\} = \\{a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$\n    *   $S_2 = X \\setminus \\{a_2\\} = \\{a_1, a_3, a_4\\}$\n    *   $S_3 = X \\setminus \\{a_3\\} = \\{a_1, a_2, a_4\\}$\n    *   $S_4 = X \\setminus \\{a_4\\} = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$\n\n*   **Shattering Argument**: We need to show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a hypothesis (a conjunction of predicates) that selects exactly $Y$.\n    A hypothesis corresponding to a conjunction of predicates from a set with indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ selects the set of points $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$.\n    Using our definitions of $S_i$:\n    $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} (X \\setminus \\{a_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{a_i\\} = X \\setminus \\{a_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$.\n\n    Now, let $Y$ be any target subset of $X$. We want to find an index set $I$ such that $X \\setminus \\{a_i \\mid i \\in I\\} = Y$. This is equivalent to finding $I$ such that $\\{a_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$ is the complement of $Y$, i.e., $X \\setminus Y$.\n\n    We can simply choose the index set $I$ to be the set of indices of the points in the complement of $Y$.\n    Let $I = \\{j \\mid a_j \\in X \\setminus Y\\}$. With this choice of $I$, our hypothesis $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ selects the set $X \\setminus (X \\setminus Y) = Y$.\n\n    For example, to select the set $Y=\\{a_1, a_3\\}$, its complement is $X \\setminus Y = \\{a_2, a_4\\}$. We choose the index set $I=\\{2, 4\\}$. The corresponding hypothesis is $P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$. This selects the set $S_2 \\cap S_4 = \\{a_1, a_3, a_4\\} \\cap \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\} = \\{a_1, a_3\\}$. This works perfectly.\n\n    Since we can construct a formula for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  The VC dimension is no more than 4.\n2.  The VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
