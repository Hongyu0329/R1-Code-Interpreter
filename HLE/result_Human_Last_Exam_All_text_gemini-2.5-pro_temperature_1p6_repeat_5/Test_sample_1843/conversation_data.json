    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N = 36036$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a *primitive* character with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a *primitive* character with conductor $p^a$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are given that $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the primitive characters for each prime power factor**\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters of a specific order for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$. Let's denote the number of primitive characters modulo $m$ of order $k$ as $N_m(k)$.\n\n*   **Conductor $2^2 = 4$**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one non-trivial character, which is primitive. Its order is 2.\n    *   $N_4(2) = 1$. Other $N_4(k) = 0$.\n\n*   **Conductor $3^2 = 9$**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(9)} = C_6$. The non-primitive characters are induced from characters modulo 3. The group of characters modulo 3 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(3)} = C_2$.\n    The number of primitive characters of order $k$ is given by (number of chars of order $k$ mod 9) - (number of chars of order $k$ mod 3).\n    *   Order $k=3$: $N_9(3) = \\psi_3(C_6) - \\psi_3(C_2) = \\phi(3) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   Order $k=6$: $N_9(6) = \\psi_6(C_6) - \\psi_6(C_2) = \\phi(6) - 0 = 2$.\n    The primitive characters modulo 9 have orders 3 and 6.\n\n*   **Conductor $7$**: For a prime $p$, all non-trivial characters are primitive. The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(7)} = C_6$.\n    *   Order $k=2$: $N_7(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Order $k=3$: $N_7(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Order $k=6$: $N_7(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **Conductor $11$**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(11)} = C_{10}$.\n    The orders of primitive characters are 2, 5, 10.\n    *   Order $k=2$: $N_{11}(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Order $k=5$: $N_{11}(5) = \\phi(5) = 4$.\n    *   Order $k=10$: $N_{11}(10) = \\phi(10) = 4$.\n\n*   **Conductor $13$**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(13)} = C_{12}$.\n    The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n    *   Order $k=2$: $N_{13}(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Order $k=3$: $N_{13}(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Order $k=4$: $N_{13}(4) = \\phi(4) = 2$.\n    *   Order $k=6$: $N_{13}(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Order $k=12$: $N_{13}(12) = \\phi(12) = 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the components to satisfy the order condition**\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_{2^2}, \\chi_{3^2}, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6. This implies:\n1.  The order of each component character, $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  At least one order $o_i$ must be a multiple of 3.\n3.  At least one order $o_j$ must be a multiple of 2.\n\nLet's count the number of available primitive characters for each component whose order divides 6.\n*   **For conductor 4**: Possible primitive orders are {2}. The order 2 divides 6.\n    Number of choices: $N_4(2) = 1$.\n*   **For conductor 9**: Possible primitive orders are {3, 6}. Both divide 6.\n    Number of choices: $N_9(3) + N_9(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n*   **For conductor 7**: Possible primitive orders are {2, 3, 6}. All divide 6.\n    Number of choices: $N_7(2) + N_7(3) + N_7(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n*   **For conductor 11**: Possible primitive orders are {2, 5, 10}. Only order 2 divides 6.\n    Number of choices: $N_{11}(2) = 1$.\n*   **For conductor 13**: Possible primitive orders are {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. Those dividing 6 are {2, 3, 6}.\n    Number of choices: $N_{13}(2) + N_{13}(3) + N_{13}(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the LCM conditions and calculate the final count**\n\nNow we check if the lcm is guaranteed to be 6 for any combination of the choices above.\n*   **Divisibility by 2**: The character $\\chi_{2^2}$ must have order 2. Therefore, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 2.\n*   **Divisibility by 3**: The character $\\chi_{3^2}$ must have order 3 or 6. In either case, its order is divisible by 3. Therefore, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince any valid combination of component characters will result in an lcm that is divisible by 2 and 3, and all component orders are divisors of 6, the final lcm must be exactly 6.\n\nSo, the total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\nTotal number = (Choices for mod 4) $\\times$ (Choices for mod 9) $\\times$ (Choices for mod 7) $\\times$ (Choices for mod 11) $\\times$ (Choices for mod 13)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = $100$\n\nThus, there are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6."
