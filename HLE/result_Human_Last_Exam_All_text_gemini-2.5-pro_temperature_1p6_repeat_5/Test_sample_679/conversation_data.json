    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n    *   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   This formula corresponds to the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$ for hydrocarbons.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 7 + 1 - 14/2 = 1.\n    *   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n    *   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single, overlapping signal.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities (DEPT information):**\n        *   **145 ppm (s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms (a quaternary carbon). This corresponds to a substituted carbon in a double bond (`=C<`).\n        *   **112 ppm (t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a carbon with two attached hydrogen atoms (a CH₂ group). This corresponds to a terminal vinyl group (`=CH₂`).\n        *   **Conclusion from alkene signals:** The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly suggest the presence of a `R₂C=CH₂` (1,1-disubstituted alkene) fragment. This confirms the molecule is an alkene, accounting for the DoU of 1.\n        *   **48 ppm (t):** This is in the aliphatic region. A triplet corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n        *   **27 ppm (d):** This is in the aliphatic region. A doublet ('d') corresponds to a CH group.\n        *   **22 ppm (q):** This is in the aliphatic region. A quartet ('q') corresponds to a CH₃ group.\n        *   **21 ppm (q):** This is also in the aliphatic region and corresponds to another CH₃ group.\n\n3.  **Identify the Overlapping Signal**\n    *   Let's sum the carbons and hydrogens based on the 6 signals, assuming one carbon per signal, to see what's missing.\n        *   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 1(q) = 6 carbons. We need 7.\n        *   Hydrogens: 0(s) + 2(t) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 3(q) + 3(q) = 11 hydrogens. We need 14.\n    *   We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens, which is a methyl (CH₃) group. This means one of the signals must account for two carbons. For the H count to be correct, the overlapping signal must represent a group that contains 3 hydrogens.\n    *   Let's test the possibility of one of the quartet signals representing two equivalent methyl groups.\n        *   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q, for 1xCH₃) + 1(q, for 2xCH₃) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7 carbons. (Correct)\n        *   Hydrogens: 0(s) + 2(t) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 3(q, for 1xCH₃) + 6(q, for 2xCH₃) = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 6 = 14 hydrogens. (Correct)\n    *   This confirms our hypothesis: the molecule contains one quaternary C, two different CH₂ groups, one CH group, and three CH₃ groups where two of them are chemically equivalent.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**\n    *   From the analysis so far, the molecule must contain these fragments:\n        1.  A `>C=CH₂` group (from 145s and 112t).\n        2.  Another `CH₂` group (from 48t).\n        3.  A `CH` group (from 27d).\n        4.  A `CH₃` group (from one 'q' signal).\n        5.  Two equivalent `CH₃` groups (from the other 'q' signal).\n    *   The only way to have two equivalent methyl groups is if they are attached to the same carbon, for instance, in an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This uses the `CH` fragment and the two equivalent `CH₃` fragments.\n    *   The remaining fragments are the `>C=CH₂` unit, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group. These can form an ethyl group (`-CH₂-CH₃`).\n    *   The complete molecule must be formed by attaching the ethyl group and the isopropyl group to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit.\n        *   This gives the structure: `(CH₃CH₂) - C(=CH₂) - CH(CH₃)₂`\n    *   Let's check if this structure, which is `2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene`, fits the NMR data.\n        *   `C(1)H₂=C(2)(CH₂CH₃)-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H₃`\n        *   `C(1)`: `=CH₂`, gives a triplet (t). Matches 112(t).\n        *   `C(2)`: `=C<`, quaternary, gives a singlet (s). Matches 145(s).\n        *   Ethyl `-CH₂-`: gives a triplet (t). Matches 48(t).\n        *   `C(3)`: `-CH<`, gives a doublet (d). Matches 27(d).\n        *   The structure has three methyl groups: the one in the ethyl group, C4, and the substituent on C3. In principle, these three are chemically distinct because C3 is a chiral center, which makes the molecule chiral. This would lead to three separate `q` signals, giving a total of 7 signals.\n        *   However, the problem gives only 6 signals and hints at overlap. The two methyl groups attached to C3 (`-CH(CH₃)CH₃`) are diastereotopic, but their chemical environments are very similar. It is very likely they are \"accidentally equivalent\" and appear as a single signal in the NMR spectrum.\n        *   Under this assumption, the predicted signals are: s, t, t, d, q (from ethyl), q (from the two equivalent methyls on the isopropyl moiety). This perfectly matches the provided data: `s`, `t`, `t`, `d`, `q`, `q`.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**\n    *   The structure is `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we must identify the longest carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n    *   Parent Chain: `C(1)H₂=C(2)-C(3)H-C(4)H₃`. This is a four-carbon chain with the double bond at position 1, so it is a `but-1-ene`.\n    *   Substituents: There is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) at position 2 and a methyl group (`-CH₃`) at position 3.\n    *   Alphabetize the substituents (ethyl before methyl).\n    *   The final IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**."
