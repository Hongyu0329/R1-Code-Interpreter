    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the coordinate system and the first cube.**\n\n*   Let's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system.\n*   We can define Cube A as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n*   The side length of Cube A is 1, and its volume is `1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the shift and define the second cube.**\n\n*   The \"main diagonal\" of Cube A connects the vertex at the origin `(0, 0, 0)` to the opposite vertex at `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `<1, 1, 1>`.\n*   The problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". In this context, this means that the coordinates of Cube B are shifted by 1/2 along each of the x, y, and z axes.\n*   The displacement vector is therefore `<1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n*   To find the coordinates for Cube B, we add this displacement to the coordinates of Cube A:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the shape and dimensions of the intersection.**\n\n*   The intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We need to find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n*   **For the x-axis:**\n    *   Cube A: `[0, 1]`\n    *   Cube B: `[1/2, 3/2]`\n    *   The intersection of these two ranges is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this interval is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **For the y-axis:**\n    *   Cube A: `[0, 1]`\n    *   Cube B: `[1/2, 3/2]`\n    *   The intersection is also `[1/2, 1]`. The length is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **For the z-axis:**\n    *   Cube A: `[0, 1]`\n    *   Cube B: `[1/2, 3/2]`\n    *   The intersection is also `[1/2, 1]`. The length is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   The resulting intersection is a rectangular prism defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`. Since all side lengths are equal, this intersection is a smaller cube.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\n\n*   The intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2.\n*   The volume of a cube is calculated as `(side length)³`.\n*   Volume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the \"Shift\":** The most crucial point is correctly interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". As analyzed, this almost always refers to a component-wise shift (`<1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`) rather than a Euclidean distance of 1/2. The component-wise interpretation leads to a clean, logical answer.\n2.  **Defining the Intersection:** The intersection is the region where *all* conditions for both objects are met. This is found by finding the overlap of the coordinate ranges for each dimension independently.\n3.  **Final Shape:** The resulting intersection of two cubes aligned with the axes will always be a rectangular prism (or a cube, as a special case).\n\nThe step-by-step analysis logically leads to the final answer.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
