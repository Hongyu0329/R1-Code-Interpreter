    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and Constraints**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around from top to bottom and left to right. We can represent the squares by coordinates $(r, c)$ where $r, c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. All calculations involving coordinates will be modulo 5.\n*   **Queens:** We need to place 4 queens.\n*   **Non-attacking condition:** No two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this means for any two queens at $(r_i, c_i)$ and $(r_j, c_j)$, the following conditions must hold:\n    1.  $r_i \\not\\equiv r_j \\pmod 5$ (different rows)\n    2.  $c_i \\not\\equiv c_j \\pmod 5$ (different columns)\n    3.  $r_i - c_i \\not\\equiv r_j - c_j \\pmod 5$ (different main diagonals)\n    4.  $r_i + c_i \\not\\equiv r_j + c_j \\pmod 5$ (different anti-diagonals)\n\n**2. Reframing the Constraints using \"Missing Elements\"**\n\nLet the coordinates of the 4 queens be $(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), (r_3, c_3), (r_4, c_4)$.\n\n*   The set of row indices $R = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$ must contain 4 distinct values from $\\mathbb{Z}_5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This means exactly one row is not occupied. Let's call the missing row $r^*$.\n*   Similarly, the set of column indices $C = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$ must have one missing column, $c^*$.\n*   Let's define the \"difference\" for each queen as $d_i = r_i - c_i \\pmod 5$. The set of differences $D = \\{d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4\\}$ must also contain 4 distinct values. Let the missing difference be $d^*$.\n*   Let's define the \"sum\" for each queen as $s_i = r_i + c_i \\pmod 5$. The set of sums $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\\}$ must also contain 4 distinct values. Let the missing sum be $s^*$.\n\n**3. Finding Relationships Between Missing Elements**\n\nThe sum of all possible values for a row, column, diff, or sum in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ is $0+1+2+3+4=10$.\n\n*   The sum of the 4 occupied rows is $\\sum r_i = 10 - r^*$.\n*   The sum of the 4 occupied columns is $\\sum c_i = 10 - c^*$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sums of the differences and sums, all modulo 5:\n*   $\\sum d_i \\equiv \\sum(r_i - c_i) \\equiv (\\sum r_i) - (\\sum c_i) \\pmod 5$.\n    *   Also, $\\sum d_i \\equiv 10 - d^* \\equiv -d^* \\pmod 5$.\n    *   Substituting the row and column sums: $(\\sum r_i) - (\\sum c_i) \\equiv (10-r^*) - (10-c^*) \\equiv c^* - r^* \\pmod 5$.\n    *   Equating the two gives our first constraint: $-d^* \\equiv c^* - r^* \\pmod 5$, which simplifies to **$d^* \\equiv r^* - c^* \\pmod 5$**.\n\n*   $\\sum s_i \\equiv \\sum(r_i + c_i) \\equiv (\\sum r_i) + (\\sum c_i) \\pmod 5$.\n    *   Also, $\\sum s_i \\equiv 10 - s^* \\equiv -s^* \\pmod 5$.\n    *   Substituting the row and column sums: $(\\sum r_i) + (\\sum c_i) \\equiv (10-r^*) + (10-c^*) \\equiv -r^* - c^* \\pmod 5$.\n    *   Equating the two gives our second constraint: $-s^* \\equiv -r^* - c^* \\pmod 5$, which simplifies to **$s^* \\equiv r^* + c^* \\pmod 5$**.\n\nThese two constraints mean that if we choose the missing row $r^*$ and the missing column $c^*$, the missing difference $d^*$ and missing sum $s^*$ are automatically determined.\nSince there are 5 choices for $r^*$ and 5 choices for $c^*$, there are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ possible valid sets of missing values $(r^*, c^*, d^*, s^*)$.\n\n**4. Solving for a Specific Case**\n\nDue to the symmetry of the toroidal board, the number of ways to place the queens should be the same for any choice of missing values. Let's choose the simplest case: $r^*=0, c^*=0$.\nFrom our constraints, this implies $d^* = 0-0=0$ and $s^*=0+0=0$.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of ways to place 4 queens such that:\n*   Rows are from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n*   Columns are from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n*   Differences $(r-c) \\pmod 5$ are from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n*   Sums $(r+c) \\pmod 5$ are from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a permutation $\\pi$ of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ where the queens are at $(i, \\pi(i))$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, such that the sets $\\{i - \\pi(i) \\pmod 5\\}$ and $\\{i + \\pi(i) \\pmod 5\\}$ are both equal to $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nBy a systematic search (or backtracking), we can find all such permutations. There are exactly two:\n1.  **Solution 1 ($S_1$):** Queens at `(1,2), (2,4), (3,1), (4,3)`.\n    *   Rows: `{1,2,3,4}`.\n    *   Cols: `{1,2,3,4}`.\n    *   Diffs (mod 5): `{1-2, 2-4, 3-1, 4-3}` = `{-1, -2, 2, 1}` = `{4, 3, 2, 1}`. Correct.\n    *   Sums (mod 5): `{1+2, 2+4, 3+1, 4+3}` = `{3, 6, 4, 7}` = `{3, 1, 4, 2}`. Correct.\n2.  **Solution 2 ($S_2$):** Queens at `(1,3), (2,1), (3,4), (4,2)`.\n    *   Rows: `{1,2,3,4}`.\n    *   Cols: `{1,2,3,4}`.\n    *   Diffs (mod 5): `{1-3, 2-1, 3-4, 4-2}` = `{-2, 1, -1, 2}` = `{3, 1, 4, 2}`. Correct.\n    *   Sums (mod 5): `{1+3, 2+1, 3+4, 4+2}` = `{4, 3, 7, 6}` = `{4, 3, 2, 1}`. Correct.\n\nSo, for the specific case where the missing values are $(0,0,0,0)$, there are exactly 2 ways to place the queens. Let's call this number $k=2$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Total Number of Ways**\n\n*   There are 25 possible sets of missing values $(r^*, c^*, d^*, s^*)$.\n*   For each set of missing values, the number of valid queen configurations is the same, $k=2$. (This is because we can translate any solution for one set of missing values to obtain a solution for another set. For example, applying the translation $(r,c) \\to (r+a, c+b)$ to a solution with missing values $(r^*, c^*, \\dots)$ results in a solution with missing values $(r^*+a, c^*+b, \\dots)$).\n*   This suggests a total of $25 \\times k = 25 \\times 2 = 50$ configurations.\n\n**6. Final Verification**\n\nWe need to ensure that these 50 configurations are all distinct. The 50 solutions are generated by taking our two base solutions ($S_1$, $S_2$) and applying all 25 possible translations $(r,c) \\to (r+a, c+b)$ for $(a,b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\n*   The 25 translations of $S_1$ are all distinct from each other because $S_1$ lacks any translational symmetry.\n*   The 25 translations of $S_2$ are all distinct from each other for the same reason.\n*   A translation of $S_1$ can never be equal to a translation of $S_2$, because $S_1$ is not a translation of $S_2$. (We can also note that $S_2$ is the reflection of $S_1$ across the main diagonal, and $S_1$ has no such translational-reflectional symmetry).\n\nTherefore, we have two disjoint sets of 25 solutions each, giving a total of $25 + 25 = 50$ unique ways.\n\n<<<50>>>"
