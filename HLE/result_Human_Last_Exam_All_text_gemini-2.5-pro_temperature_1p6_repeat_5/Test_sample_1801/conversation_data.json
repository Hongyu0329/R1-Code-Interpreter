    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** An infamous commercial.\n    *   **Company:** Enron.\n    *   **Year:** 2000.\n    *   **Tagline:** \"Ask Why\".\n    *   **Individuals to Identify:** Two Nobel laureates featured in the commercial.\n\n2.  **Research the Enron \"Ask Why\" Campaign:**\n    *   The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a high-profile advertising series launched by Enron in 2000. Its goal was to rebrand Enron from just an energy company to an innovative, global leader in new markets.\n    *   The campaign became \"infamous\" in retrospect after Enron's massive accounting fraud was exposed, leading to its collapse in 2001. The tagline \"Ask Why\" became deeply ironic, as the company's success was built on deception that few questioned at the time.\n\n3.  **Identify the Featured Personalities:**\n    *   Enron hired several prominent thinkers and economists to lend credibility to its campaign. Research into the specific television spots reveals the names of the participants.\n    *   The two individuals who are Nobel laureates and most famously associated with this campaign are **Paul Krugman** and **Merton Miller**. They appeared in separate commercials under the same \"Ask Why\" banner.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"Nobel Laureate\":** One of the key details is the timing of the Nobel Prizes.\n    *   **Merton Miller** received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990. He was therefore a Nobel laureate at the time he filmed the commercial in 2000. (He passed away in June 2000).\n    *   **Paul Krugman** filmed his commercial in 2000 but did not receive his Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences until 2008. While he wasn't a laureate at the time of the commercial, he *is* a Nobel laureate, which satisfies the wording of the question.\n*   **\"A Commercial\" vs. \"A Campaign\":** The question mentions \"a commercial,\" but Krugman and Miller appeared in separate TV spots that were part of the same overall campaign. The campaign as a whole is what is collectively remembered and referred to.\n*   **Other Laureates:** Another Nobel laureate, Myron Scholes (who won in 1997), also appeared in one of the ads in the campaign. However, the most commonly cited pair in media retrospectives and discussions about this infamous campaign are Krugman and Miller.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBy researching the cast of Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign, we can confirm the participation of several well-known economists. Cross-referencing these names with the list of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winners identifies the two individuals in question. Merton Miller was already a laureate, and Paul Krugman would become one later. Together, they are the two laureates most frequently cited as having been featured in this infamous campaign.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
