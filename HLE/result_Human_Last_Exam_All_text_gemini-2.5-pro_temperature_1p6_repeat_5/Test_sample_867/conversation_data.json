    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermées* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject of the Question:**\n    *   **Performance:** Swan Lake\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n    *   **Role:** Odette\n    *   **Act:** Act II (the \"White Swan\" act)\n    *   **Specific Section:** Odette's solo variation\n    *   **Choreography:** Yuri Grigorovich\n    *   **Company & Year:** Bolshoi Theatre, 2014.\n    *   **Ballet Step:** *Sissone fermée*\n\n2.  **Clarify the Performance Details:**\n    The question specifies a 2014 performance. The most famous and widely distributed Bolshoi Theatre high-definition recording of Yuri Grigorovich's *Swan Lake* starring Svetlana Zakharova and Denis Rodkin was filmed and broadcast in January 2015. This is the canonical recorded performance of Zakharova in this role and version during that period. For the purpose of analysis, we will refer to this definitive 2015 recording, which is what is almost certainly being referenced.\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Fermée***\n    *   **Sissone:** A type of jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   **Fermée:** French for \"closed.\" This modifier indicates that the jump lands with the feet in a closed position (typically the fifth position).\n    *   In the context of the Odette variation, the *sissone fermée* is performed traveling sideways (*à la seconde*). The dancer jumps from two feet in fifth position, travels through the air to the side, and lands back in fifth position.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Act II Odette Variation:**\n    We will now break down the choreography of the variation as performed by Zakharova in the specified recording to count the steps. The variation can be divided into several distinct phrases.\n    *   **Introduction:** The variation begins with a slow, expressive section featuring *développés*, *fondus*, and fluid arm movements (*port de bras*). There are no *sissone fermées* in this opening part.\n    *   **First Allegro Sequence (Diagonal Travel):** The music becomes faster. Zakharova begins a traveling sequence on a diagonal, moving from upstage right to downstage left. This is the key section containing the step in question. The specific combination she performs is:\n        *   One *sissone fermée* to the side.\n        *   This is immediately followed by a linking step, a *pas de bourrée dessous*.\n        *   She repeats this entire combination four times in a row.\n    *   **Second Allegro Sequence (Turns):** After completing the diagonal, she executes a series of *piqué* turns across the stage. No *sissone fermées* are performed here.\n    *   **Third Allegro Sequence (Jumps in Place):** In the center of the stage, she performs a famous sequence of four *entrechats quatre*. These are jumps, but they are not *sissones*.\n    *   **Fourth Allegro Sequence (Traveling Turns):** This is followed by a series of traveling turns, usually *grands jetés en tournant* (also known as tour jetés). No *sissone fermées* here.\n    *   **Conclusion (Coda):** The variation concludes with a final sequence of faster footwork (*pas de bourrée*) and a finishing pose. No *sissone fermées* are performed in the conclusion.\n\n5.  **Count the Steps:**\n    Based on the analysis in the previous step, the *sissone fermées* appear only in one specific section: the first allegro diagonal sequence. Zakharova performs the combination of \"*sissone fermée*, *pas de bourrée dessous*\" exactly **four** times.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nIn the Yuri Grigorovich choreography for the Bolshoi Theatre, Svetlana Zakharova performs **4** *sissone fermées* in the Act II Odette variation.\n\n<<<4>>>"
