    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Visualize the Diagram\n\nThe question asks for the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices:** These are the points where interactions occur.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In a Feynman diagram, contractions are represented by lines (propagators) that connect the vertices.\n*   **Perturbative Green's function analysis:** This is the context of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) where such diagrams appear.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the diagram consists of two vertices, let's call them $V_1$ and $V_2$. Since there are only two vertices, the four contractions (lines) must all connect $V_1$ to $V_2$. This topology is often called a \"figure-eight\" or \"sunglasses\" diagram. Since there are no external lines mentioned, this is a vacuum diagram. Such a diagram would arise from a theory with at least a four-field interaction vertex, like the $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Define the Symmetry Factor\n\nBefore calculating, it's important to be clear on several points:\n\n1.  **Definition of the Symmetry Factor (S):** The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is the order (size) of its automorphism group. In simpler terms, it is the number of ways you can permute the components of the diagram (internal lines and vertices) while leaving the diagram's overall structure (its topology) unchanged. The contribution of a given diagram to a physical quantity is divided by its symmetry factor S.\n\n2.  **Sources of Symmetry:** Symmetries arise from the permutation of identical components. We need to look for:\n    *   **Identical Vertices:** Are there any vertices that can be swapped without changing the diagram?\n    *   **Identical Lines:** Are there any lines (propagators) that can be swapped without changing the diagram? This happens when multiple lines connect the same pair of vertices or are otherwise topologically equivalent.\n\n3.  **Diagram Components:** For our specific diagram, we have:\n    *   Two vertices, $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n    *   Four internal lines, let's call them $L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4$. All four lines connect $V_1$ to $V_2$.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Calculation of the Symmetry Factor\n\nWe calculate the total symmetry factor by multiplying the number of permutations for each independent symmetry operation.\n\n1.  **Vertex Symmetry:**\n    *   The two vertices, $V_1$ and $V_2$, are topologically equivalent. Each one is connected to the other by four lines.\n    *   If we swap the labels of $V_1$ and $V_2$, the diagram looks identical.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these two equivalent vertices is $2! = 2$.\n    *   This gives a symmetry factor of **2**.\n\n2.  **Line Symmetry:**\n    *   The four lines, $L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4$, are all topologically equivalent. They all connect the same pair of vertices ($V_1$ and $V_2$).\n    *   We can swap these four lines among themselves in any order, and the diagram remains unchanged. For example, swapping $L_1$ and $L_2$ results in the exact same diagram.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n    *   This gives a symmetry factor of **24**.\n\n3.  **Total Symmetry Factor:**\n    *   The total symmetry factor, S, is the product of the individual factors from each symmetry operation.\n    *   S = (Vertex Permutation Factor) × (Line Permutation Factor)\n    *   S = 2 × 24\n    *   S = 48\n\nTherefore, the symmetry factor associated with this Feynman diagram is 48. This means that when calculating the contribution of this diagram to a Green's function, its value would be divided by 48 to account for the overcounting of identical configurations in the perturbative expansion.\n\n<<<48>>>"
