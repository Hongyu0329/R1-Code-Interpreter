    "This problem requires an analysis of the structure of the functional integral for a scalar field at finite temperature. We will break down the components of the question, define them in the context of thermal field theory, and combine them to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Framework**\n\n*   **Finite-Temperature Field Theory:** This implies we use the imaginary-time (or Matsubara) formalism. The time coordinate, $\\tau$, is treated as imaginary ($t \\to -i\\tau$) and is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature (we set $k_B = 1$). Fields are periodic in imaginary time, i.e., $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\mathbf{x})$.\n*   **Neutral Scalar Field:** The field $\\phi(x)$ is real and has a mass $m$.\n*   **Functional Integral Representation:** The partition function $Z$ is expressed as a path integral over all possible field configurations:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n    where $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Euclidean Action $S_E[\\phi]$**\n\nThe Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}_E$, over the Euclidean spacetime volume (with dimension $d+1$, where $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions).\n\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu\\phi)(\\partial^\\mu\\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$\n\nThe action is:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int d^{d+1}x \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right)$\n\n**Step 3: Define the Inner Product and the Operator $D_\\phi$**\n\n*   **Inner Product:** In a function space, the natural inner product between two real fields, $\\psi_1(x)$ and $\\psi_2(x)$, is the standard $L^2$ inner product, defined by integrating their product over the entire spacetime domain:\n    $(\\psi_1, \\psi_2) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\psi_1(x) \\psi_2(x)$\n\n*   **Operator $D_\\phi$**: The notation $D_\\phi$ is not standard. Typically, $D$ refers to the kinetic operator of the free theory. The subscript $\\phi$ may be a typo or simply emphasizing that the operator acts on the field $\\phi$. We will interpret $D_\\phi$ as the operator $D$ which defines the quadratic part of the action. To identify this operator, we rewrite the action by performing an integration by parts on the kinetic term $(\\partial_\\mu\\phi)^2$:\n    $\\int d^{d+1}x \\, (\\partial_\\mu\\phi)^2 = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\left( \\partial_\\mu(\\phi \\partial^\\mu\\phi) - \\phi(\\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu \\phi) \\right)$\n    The first term, $\\partial_\\mu(\\phi \\partial^\\mu\\phi)$, is a total derivative. Its integral vanishes due to the periodic boundary conditions in the $\\tau$ direction and the assumption that fields decay sufficiently fast at spatial infinity. This leaves us with:\n    $\\int d^{d+1}x \\, (\\partial_\\mu\\phi)^2 = - \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(\\partial^2 \\phi)$\n    where $\\partial^2 = \\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$ is the Euclidean Laplacian.\n\n    Substituting this back into the action gives:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int d^{d+1}x \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\phi (\\partial^2 \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right)$\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\n    From this quadratic form, we identify the operator $D$ as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D = -\\partial^2 + m^2$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inner Product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$**\n\nNow we compute the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ using our definitions. We interpret this as $(\\phi, D\\phi)$.\nUsing the definition of the inner product from Step 3:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (D\\phi)(x)$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the operator $D$:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\n**Step 5: Relate the Inner Product to the Action**\n\nWe now compare the result from Step 4 with the expression for the Euclidean action $S_E[\\phi]$ derived at the end of Step 3:\n*   $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n*   $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\nBy direct comparison, we find the simple relationship:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$\n\nThis inner product represents the quadratic form that defines the Gaussian weighting factor $e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$ for each field configuration $\\phi$ in the functional integral.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2S_E[\\phi]}$.\n\n<<<2S_E[\\phi]>>>"
