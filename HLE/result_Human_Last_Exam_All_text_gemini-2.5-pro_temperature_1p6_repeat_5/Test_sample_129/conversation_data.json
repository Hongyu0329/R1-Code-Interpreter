    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n**1. Understand the Building Blocks**\n\n*   **Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n*   **Literals (L):** T (True), F (False)\n*   **Operators:** ! (NOT, unary), & (AND, binary), | (OR, binary)\n*   **Parentheses:** ( , )\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Goal:** Count the number of unique syntactical expressions that evaluate to **True**.\n*   **Precedence:** `!` has the highest precedence, followed by `&`, then `|`. All binary operators are left-associative. For example, `T&F|T` is parsed as `(T&F)|T`.\n\n**2. Identify All Possible Syntactic Structures of Length 5**\n\nWe must find all unique templates for a 5-symbol expression and then count the true variations for each. An expression's structure is determined by the number and placement of operators, literals, and parentheses.\n\n*   **Structure 1: `L op L op L`** (3 literals, 2 binary operators)\n    *   Example: `T & F | T`. Length is 1+1+1+1+1 = 5.\n    *   This structure does not contain `!` or `()`. The parsing is handled by operator precedence.\n    *   There are 2³=8 ways to choose the three literals (T/F).\n    *   There are 2²=4 ways to choose the two operators (&/|).\n    *   We analyze the 4 operator combinations:\n        *   `L1 & L2 | L3`: (Parsed as `(L1 & L2) | L3`). This is true if `L3` is `T` (4 cases), or if `L1` and `L2` are both `T` while `L3` is `F` (1 case: `T&T|F`). Total: **5** true expressions.\n        *   `L1 | L2 & L3`: (Parsed as `L1 | (L2 & L3)`). This is true if `L1` is `T` (4 cases), or if `L2` and `L3` are both `T` while `L1` is `F` (1 case: `F|T&T`). Total: **5** true expressions.\n        *   `L1 & L2 & L3`: This is true only if all literals are `T` (1 case: `T&T&T`). Total: **1** true expression.\n        *   `L1 | L2 | L3`: This is true unless all literals are `F` (7 cases). Total: **7** true expressions.\n    *   Total for Structure 1: 5 + 5 + 1 + 7 = **18**.\n\n*   **Structure 2: `(L op L)`** (2 literals, 1 binary operator, 2 parentheses)\n    *   Example: `(T & F)`. Length is 1+1+1+1+1 = 5.\n    *   `op = &`: `(L1 & L2)` is true only for `(T & T)`. **1** true expression.\n    *   `op = |`: `(L1 | L2)` is true for `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, and `(F|T)`. **3** true expressions.\n    *   Total for Structure 2: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n*   **Structure 3: `!L op !L`** (2 literals, 2 `!`, 1 binary operator)\n    *   Example: `!T & !F`. Parsed as `(!L1) op (!L2)`. Length is 1+1+1+1+1 = 5.\n    *   `op = &`: `(!L1) & (!L2)` is true only if `!L1` and `!L2` are both true, meaning `L1` and `L2` are both `F`. (1 case: `!F & !F`). Total: **1** true expression.\n    *   `op = |`: `(!L1) | (!L2)` is true unless both `!L1` and `!L2` are false, meaning `L1` and `L2` are both `T`. This happens in 3 out of 4 cases. Total: **3** true expressions.\n    *   Total for Structure 3: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n*   **Structure 4: `!!L op L`** and **`L op !!L`** (2 literals, 2 `!`, 1 binary operator)\n    *   Example: `!!T & F`. Parsed as `(!!L) & L`, which is equivalent to `L & L`. Length 2+1+1+1=5.\n    *   **`!!L1 op L2`**: Evaluates like `L1 op L2`.\n        *   `op = &`: True only for `!!T & T`. **1** true expression.\n        *   `op = |`: True for `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. **3** true expressions.\n        *   Subtotal: 4.\n    *   **`L1 op !!L2`**: Evaluates like `L1 op L2`.\n        *   `op = &`: True only for `T & !!T`. **1** true expression.\n        *   `op = |`: True for `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. **3** true expressions.\n        *   Subtotal: 4.\n    *   Total for Structure 4: 4 + 4 = **8**.\n\n*   **Structure 5: `L op (L)`** and **`(L) op L`** (2 literals, 1 binary op, 2 parentheses)\n    *   Example: `T & (F)`. Length is 1+1+3 = 5.\n    *   **`L1 op (L2)`**: `(L2)` evaluates to `L2`. So this is equivalent to `L1 op L2`.\n        * `op=&`: 1 true case `T&(T)`. **1** true.\n        * `op=|`: 3 true cases `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. **3** true.\n        * Subtotal: 4.\n    *   **`(L1) op L2`**: Equivalent to `L1 op L2`.\n        * `op=&`: 1 true case `(T)&T`. **1** true.\n        * `op=|`: 3 true cases `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. **3** true.\n        * Subtotal: 4.\n    *   Total for Structure 5: 4 + 4 = **8**.\n\n*   **Structures with 1 literal and multiple operators/parentheses:**\n    *   **`!!(L)`**: `!!(T)` is T. `!!(F)` is F. **1** true expression.\n    *   **`((L))`**: `((T))` is T. `((F))` is F. **1** true expression.\n    *   **`(!!L)`**: `(!!T)` -> `(T)` -> T. `(!!F)` -> `(F)` -> F. **1** true expression.\n    *   **`!(!L)`**: `!(!T)` -> `!(F)` -> T. `!(!F)` -> `!(T)` -> F. **1** true expression.\n    *   Total for these 4 structures: 1+1+1+1 = **4**.\n\n**3. Sum the Counts**\n\nNow we sum the number of true expressions from all disjoint structures.\n\n*   From Structure 1 (`L op L op L`): **18**\n*   From Structure 2 (`(L op L)`): **4**\n*   From Structure 3 (`!L op !L`): **4**\n*   From Structure 4 (`!!L op L` and `L op !!L`): **8**\n*   From Structure 5 (`L op (L)` and `(L) op L`): **8**\n*   From the four 1-literal structures: **4**\n\nTotal = 18 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 4 = **46**."
