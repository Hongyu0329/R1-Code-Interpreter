    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In its simplest form, a single high-energy photon (the \"pump\" photon) passes through a specific type of optical medium and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). For this process to occur, two fundamental physical laws must be conserved:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The energy of the incoming pump photon must equal the sum of the energies of the two outgoing photons. ($E_{pump} = E_{signal} + E_{idler}$)\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The momentum of the pump photon must equal the vector sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons. This is often referred to as the \"phase-matching\" condition and is critical for the efficiency of the process.\n\nCrucially, SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**. The interaction between the light and the material is described by the material's electric susceptibility, which can be expressed as a power series. Second-order effects are governed by the second-order susceptibility tensor, denoted as $\\boldsymbol{\\chi^{(2)}}$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Material Requirement for SPDC**\n\nThe central requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear effect, including SPDC, is that its second-order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$, must be non-zero.\n\nThere is a fundamental selection rule in optics and crystallography related to material symmetry:\n\n*   **For a material to have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$, it must lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).**\n\nIn a centrosymmetric material, for every atom at a position `(x, y, z)` relative to a central point, there is an identical atom at `(-x, -y, -z)`. This high degree of symmetry causes the second-order nonlinear response to average out to zero across the material.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Material in Question - Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets**\n\nThe question specifies \"free-standing boron nanosheets,\" also known as **borophene**. Borophene is a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of boron, analogous to graphene for carbon.\n\n*   **Crystal Structure and Symmetry:** Like graphene, the most stable and commonly synthesized phases of borophene (such as the striped phase, $\\beta_{12}$ sheet, and $\\chi_{3}$ sheet) are planar crystalline structures. A key feature of these common borophene phases is that they possess a **center of inversion symmetry**. The arrangement of boron atoms in the 2D lattice is symmetric with respect to a central point.\n*   **\"Free-standing\" condition:** This is an important detail. It implies that the nanosheet is isolated and not placed on a substrate. Interaction with a substrate could break the overall symmetry of the system and potentially induce a weak second-order nonlinearity, but this effect is excluded by the problem statement.\n\n**Step 4: Connect Material Properties to SPDC Requirements and Draw a Conclusion**\n\n1.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process that requires the material to have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, due to their crystal symmetry, the intrinsic bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ of boron nanosheets is zero.\n\nBased on this analysis, ideal free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. While real-world nanosheets may have defects, edges, or strain that locally break the inversion symmetry, these would only lead to an extremely weak and inefficient SPDC response, which is not characteristic of the material itself. The dominant optical response will be governed by odd-order nonlinearities (like $\\chi^{(3)}$), which are allowed in centrosymmetric materials.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The distinction between $\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$ processes:** Borophene is centrosymmetric, so while it won't exhibit second-order effects like SPDC or second-harmonic generation (SHG), it is expected to exhibit third-order effects (governed by $\\chi^{(3)}$) like third-harmonic generation (THG) and four-wave mixing.\n2.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** The conclusion is based on the ideal crystal structure. In reality, effects at the edges of a finite nanosheet can break symmetry, but this is a boundary effect, not a bulk property.\n3.  **Role of the \"Free-Standing\" qualifier:** This is critical because placing a centrosymmetric 2D material on a substrate often breaks the symmetry of the combined system, which *can* lead to the emergence of a $\\chi^{(2)}$ response. By specifying \"free-standing,\" the question focuses on the intrinsic properties of the material alone.\n4.  **Analogy to Graphene:** Graphene is another well-known 2D material that is centrosymmetric. It also has a zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ and therefore does not exhibit SPDC, which reinforces the conclusion for the similarly symmetric borophene.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe primary requirement for SPDC is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. Free-standing boron nanosheets possess a center of inversion symmetry. Consequently, their second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) is zero, precluding the SPDC process.\n\n<<<No>>>"
