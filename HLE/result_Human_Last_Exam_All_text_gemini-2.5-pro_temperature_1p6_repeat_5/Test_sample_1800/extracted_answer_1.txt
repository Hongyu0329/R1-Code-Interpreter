The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not a single value but depends strongly on the target reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a higher ratio is needed to maximize the Ni-CeOâ‚‚ interface; optimal molar Ni/Ce ratios are typically in the range of 0.25 to 0.4. For thermochemical water splitting (WS), a lower ratio is ideal to enhance the bulk redox properties without causing phase separation, with optimal molar Ni/Ce ratios typically in the range of 0.05 to 0.15.
