    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{128}$)**: The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of order 128. It is denoted as $Q_{128}$ or $Q_{2^7}$. Its structure is defined by the following presentation:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, y^2 = x^{32}, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n    The elements of this group can be uniquely written in the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$, where $0 \\le i \\le 63$. This gives a total of $64 + 64 = 128$ elements.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup**: A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be generated by a single element of $G$. In other words, a power subgroup is a **cyclic subgroup**. The question is asking for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Step 2: Devise a Strategy\n\nTo find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups, we can classify the elements of $Q_{128}$ and count the distinct subgroups generated by them. A natural way to classify the elements is to separate them into two types:\n1.  Elements that are powers of $x$. These are of the form $x^i$.\n2.  Elements that are not powers of $x$. These are of the form $x^i y$.\n\nWe will count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of each type and then sum the results, making sure there is no overlap between the two sets of subgroups.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Subgroups Generated by Powers of $x$\n\nThe elements of this type are of the form $g = x^i$, for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$. All such elements belong to the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^0, x^1, \\dots, x^{63}\\}$ is a cyclic group of order 64, isomorphic to $C_{64}$.\n*   The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order $n$ is equal to the number of divisors of $n$, denoted by $\\tau(n)$.\n*   For $\\langle x \\rangle$, the order is $n=64=2^6$. The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n*   Therefore, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are $\\langle x^{64/d} \\rangle$ for each divisor $d$ of 64. Specifically, they are $\\langle x \\rangle, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, and $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Subgroups Generated by Elements of the Form $x^i y$\n\nThe elements of this type are of the form $g = x^i y$, for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n*   First, we determine the order of such an element. We use the relations $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$ (which implies $xy=yx^{-1}$) and $y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    $g^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i(yx^i)y = x^i(x^{-i}y)y = (x^i x^{-i})y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   Since $g^2 = x^{32}$ and the order of $x^{32}$ is 2 (because $(x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$), we have:\n    $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = 1$.\n*   The order of $g$ cannot be 1 or 2, as $g \\neq 1$ and $g^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$. Thus, the order of any element $g = x^i y$ is **4**.\n*   This means every element of the form $x^i y$ generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   Now we need to count how many *distinct* such subgroups exist. Let's examine the subgroup generated by $g = x^i y$:\n    $\\langle x^i y \\rangle = \\{1, g, g^2, g^3\\} = \\{1, x^i y, x^{32}, (x^{32})(x^i y)\\} = \\{1, x^{32}, x^i y, x^{i+32} y\\}$.\n*   Let's determine when two such subgroups, $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$ and $\\langle x^j y \\rangle$, are the same. This happens if and only if $x^j y$ is an element of $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$. The only elements of the form $x^k y$ in $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$ are $x^i y$ and $x^{i+32} y$.\n*   So, $\\langle x^i y \\rangle = \\langle x^j y \\rangle$ if and only if $j \\equiv i \\pmod{64}$ or $j \\equiv i+32 \\pmod{64}$. This is equivalent to $j \\equiv i \\pmod{32}$.\n*   This means that the 64 elements of the form $x^i y$ (for $i=0, \\dots, 63$) generate subgroups in pairs. The element $x^i y$ and the element $x^{i+32} y$ generate the same subgroup.\n*   The number of distinct subgroups is the number of such pairs, which is $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nWe have found two disjoint sets of cyclic subgroups:\n1.  A set of **7** cyclic subgroups that are contained entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  A set of **32** cyclic subgroups of order 4, each generated by an element of the form $x^i y$.\n\nThese two sets are disjoint because any subgroup in the second set contains elements ($x^i y$) that are not in $\\langle x \\rangle$, whereas all subgroups in the first set are subsets of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Therefore, no subgroup from the first set can be equal to a subgroup from the second set.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the numbers from both sets.\nTotal number = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n<<<39>>>"
