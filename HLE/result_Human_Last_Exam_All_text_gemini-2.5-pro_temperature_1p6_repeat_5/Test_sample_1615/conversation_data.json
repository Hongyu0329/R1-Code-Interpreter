    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of colors needed.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$. Let's identify the given properties of $G$:\n1.  The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n2.  The graph $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n3.  The term \"number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\" refers to the chromatic number, denoted by $\\chi(G)$, which is the *minimum* number of colors required for a proper coloring of that specific graph $G$.\n4.  The question asks for the \"maximum\" such number. This means we need to find the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ among all graphs $G$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all graphs with 12345 vertices that are not complete. The problem is to find the value of $\\max_{G \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\chi(G)$.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the chromatic number**\n\nLet's recall some fundamental theorems from graph theory regarding vertex coloring:\n*   For any graph $H$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number satisfies $\\chi(H) \\le n$.\n*   The equality $\\chi(H) = n$ holds if and only if $H$ is a complete graph, $K_n$.\n\nThe problem states that our graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is **not** a complete graph. Based on the theorems above, since $G \\neq K_{12345}$, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n$\\chi(G) < n$\nThis implies that $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\nFor our specific case, $n = 12345$, so for any graph $G$ satisfying the conditions, we have:\n$\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound: the maximum number of colors needed cannot exceed 12344.\n\n**Step 3: Show that this upper bound can be achieved**\n\nNow, we need to check if there exists a graph $G_0$ that satisfies the conditions and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344. If we can find such a graph, it will prove that the maximum possible value is indeed 12344.\n\nLet's construct a candidate graph $G_0$ with $n=12345$ vertices:\nConsider the graph formed by taking a complete graph on $12344$ vertices, let's call it $H = K_{12344}$, and adding one additional vertex, $v$, that is completely disconnected from all vertices in $H$ (i.e., $v$ is an isolated vertex).\nThe resulting graph $G_0$ is the disjoint union of $K_{12344}$ and a single vertex $K_1$, written as $G_0 = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$.\n\nLet's check if this graph $G_0$ meets the problem's criteria:\n1.  **Number of vertices**: $G_0$ has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. This is correct.\n2.  **Not a complete graph**: $G_0$ is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex $v$ is not connected to any other vertex in the graph. This is correct.\n\nNow, let's determine the chromatic number of $G_0$:\n*   The subgraph $K_{12344}$ is a complete graph on 12344 vertices. By definition, a proper coloring of this subgraph requires 12344 distinct colors.\n*   Therefore, any proper coloring of the entire graph $G_0$ must use at least 12344 colors. This gives us a lower bound: $\\chi(G_0) \\ge 12344$.\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that for any such graph, $\\chi(G_0) \\le 12344$.\nCombining our lower bound and upper bound for this specific graph $G_0$:\n$12344 \\le \\chi(G_0) \\le 12344$\nThis forces the chromatic number to be exactly $\\chi(G_0) = 12344$.\n\n**Step 4: Careful points and final conclusion**\n\n*   **Role of maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$**: The question mentions that $G$ has a maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$. This might suggest using Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$ that is not complete and not an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. While this is a powerful theorem, it is not the most direct path to the solution here and can be a distraction. Our constructed graph $G_0 = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$ is not connected, and one of its components is a complete graph, so it's an exception to the main statement of Brooks' theorem. The simpler argument based on the property $\\chi(G) = n \\iff G=K_n$ is sufficient and more direct.\n*   **The logic is general**: The reasoning holds for any number of vertices $n \\ge 2$. The maximum chromatic number for a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices is always $n-1$.\n\nWe have demonstrated that:\n1.  Any graph on 12345 vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most 12344 colors.\n2.  There exists at least one such graph that requires exactly 12344 colors.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors that we need is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
