    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks for a specific numerical detail about a particular anatomical feature of a specific dinosaur species.\n*   **Species:** *Irritator challengeri* (a spinosaurid dinosaur).\n*   **Anatomical Feature:** The lacrimal recess. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull located in front of the eye. A recess is a depression or indentation in a bone.\n*   **Detail Required:** The number of depressions that constitute the lacrimal recess.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the primary scientific source**\nTo answer a detailed anatomical question about a specific fossil, we must refer to the primary scientific literature describing it. The holotype (the original specimen upon which the species is based) of *Irritator challengeri* is specimen SMNS 58022. The most detailed and foundational description of this skull is found in the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the anatomical description in the source**\nIn their 2002 paper, Sues et al. provide a detailed description of the skull bones of *Irritator*. When discussing the lacrimal bone, they note its position and features. The lacrimal forms the upper rear border of the large opening in the snout called the antorbital fossa.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the \"lacrimal recess\"**\nThe key part of the description states that within the larger antorbital fossa, there is a smaller, distinct depression located on the lacrimal bone. The paper describes this feature as follows (paraphrased from the technical description): a single, deep, and subtriangular recess is present on the lateral surface of the lacrimal, positioned above the antorbital fenestra proper.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of depressions**\nThe scientific description identifies the lacrimal recess as a singular anatomical feature. It is described as \"**a** distinct... recess\", indicating it is one unit. There is no mention of this single recess being subdivided into multiple smaller pits or depressions. Therefore, based on the holotype's description, the lacrimal recess is a single depression.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the primary scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri* indicates the presence of one distinct lacrimal recess.\n\n<<<1>>>"
