    "This problem asks for the size of the largest possible union of 20 antichains in the poset $P = (\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}, |)$, where $N = 823564528378596$ and the relation is divisibility.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understanding the question**: We are looking for the maximum size of a set $U \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ such that $U$ can be written as the union of 20 antichains, $U = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup A_{20}$.\n\n2.  **Applying Poset Theory**: A fundamental theorem in poset theory, the dual of Dilworth's theorem (also known as Mirsky's theorem), states that a poset can be partitioned into $k$ antichains if and only if its longest chain has length at most $k$. If we apply this to the sub-poset induced by $U$, it means that the set $U$ is a union of 20 antichains if and only if the longest chain of divisors within $U$ has a length of at most 20. A chain is a sequence $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k$ such that $c_1 | c_2 | \\dots | c_k$. The length of this chain is $k$.\n\n3.  **Reformulating the problem**: The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum size of a subset $U \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ such that there is no chain $c_1 | c_2 | \\dots | c_{21}$ with all elements $c_i \\in U$.\n\n4.  **Greene's Theorem**: A generalization of Dilworth's theorem by Curtis Greene relates the size of the largest union of $k$ antichains to the chain structure of the poset. It states that the maximum size of a union of $k$ antichains is equal to $\\min_{\\mathcal{C}} \\sum_{C \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\min(k, |C|)$, where the minimum is taken over all possible partitions $\\mathcal{C}$ of the poset into disjoint chains.\n\n5.  **Chain Decomposition**: To apply this theorem, we need to find an optimal chain partition of the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. A well-known method to partition this set into chains is to group numbers based on their largest odd divisor. Any integer $n$ can be uniquely written as $n = m \\cdot 2^j$ for some odd integer $m$ and some integer $j \\ge 0$.\n    For each odd number $m \\le N$, we can form a chain $C_m = \\{m, 2m, 4m, 8m, \\dots\\} \\cap \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$.\n    The set of all such chains $\\{C_m \\mid m \\text{ is odd, } 1 \\le m \\le N\\}$ forms a partition of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\n6.  **Optimality of the Decomposition**: The number of chains in this partition is the number of odd integers up to $N$, which is $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$. The size of the largest antichain in this poset is known to be $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$ (the set of integers in $(\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor, N]$ is a large antichain). Since the minimum number of chains in any partition is equal to the size of the largest antichain (width of the poset), this decomposition is optimal (i.e., it has the minimum possible number of chains).\n\n7.  **Calculating the size**: With $k=20$, the size of the largest union of 20 antichains is given by the formula:\n    Size = $\\sum_{m \\text{ odd}, 1 \\le m \\le N} \\min(20, |C_m|)$.\n    The size of a chain $C_m$ is $|C_m| = |\\{j \\ge 0 \\mid m \\cdot 2^j \\le N\\}| = \\lfloor\\log_2(N/m)\\rfloor + 1$.\n    The sum is thus $\\sum_{m \\text{ odd}, 1 \\le m \\le N} \\min(20, \\lfloor\\log_2(N/m)\\rfloor + 1)$.\n\n8.  **Simplifying the sum**: We can rearrange the summation by grouping terms based on the size of the chains. Let $n_j$ be the number of chains of length $j$. The sum is $\\sum_j j \\cdot n_j$ for $j < 20$ and $\\sum_j 20 \\cdot n_j$ for $j \\ge 20$.\n    A more direct way is to use summation by parts:\n    Let $O(x) = \\lceil x/2 \\rceil$ be the number of odd integers in $[1, x]$.\n    The number of odd integers $m$ such that $|C_m| = j$ is $O(N/2^{j-1}) - O(N/2^j)$.\n    The sum is $\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\min(20, j) \\cdot (O(N/2^{j-1}) - O(N/2^j))$.\n    This can be shown to simplify to $\\sum_{j=1}^{20} O(N/2^{j-1}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} O(N/2^i)$.\n    Since $O(x) = \\lceil x/2 \\rceil$, the formula is:\n    Size = $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} \\lceil \\frac{N}{2^{i+1}} \\rceil = \\sum_{j=1}^{20} \\lceil \\frac{N}{2^j} \\rceil$.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation**: We need to compute this sum for $N = 823564528378596$.\n    j=1: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 2 \\rceil = 411782264189298$\n    j=2: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 4 \\rceil = 205891132094649$\n    j=3: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 8 \\rceil = 102945566047325$\n    j=4: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 16 \\rceil = 51472783023663$\n    j=5: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 32 \\rceil = 25736391511832$\n    j=6: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 64 \\rceil = 12868195755916$\n    j=7: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 128 \\rceil = 6434097877958$\n    j=8: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 256 \\rceil = 3217048938979$\n    j=9: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 512 \\rceil = 1608524469490$\n    j=10: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 1024 \\rceil = 804262234745$\n    j=11: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 2048 \\rceil = 402131117373$\n    j=12: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 4096 \\rceil = 201065558687$\n    j=13: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 8192 \\rceil = 100532779344$\n    j=14: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 16384 \\rceil = 50266389672$\n    j=15: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 32768 \\rceil = 25133194836$\n    j=16: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 65536 \\rceil = 12566597418$\n    j=17: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 131072 \\rceil = 6283298709$\n    j=18: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 262144 \\rceil = 3141649355$\n    j=19: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 524288 \\rceil = 1570824678$\n    j=20: $\\lceil 823564528378596 / 1048576 \\rceil = 785412339$\n\n    Summing these twenty values gives:\n    $411782264189298 + 205891132094649 + \\dots + 785412339 = 822779116039958$."
