    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted by $|S|$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of `f`**: The function `f` must be injective (one-to-one).\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying `f` to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    From the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Thus, $f$ is injective.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of `f`**: It is given that `f` is continuous. A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. That is, `f` must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the case where `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nIf `f` is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, it must have a unique fixed point. A proof sketch for this is to consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ is a constant or $-\\infty$, and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ is a constant or $+\\infty$. This implies $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} g(x) = +\\infty$. Since $g(x)$ is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist some $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x_0) = 0$, which means $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n\nLet $x_0$ be this fixed point of `f`.\n$f(x_0) = x_0$.\nApplying `f` to both sides, we get $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0)$.\nSubstituting the known relations, we have $f(f(x_0)) = x_0$.\nThe given equation requires $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$.\nTherefore, the fixed point $x_0$ must satisfy the equation $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$.\n\nHowever, the equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions. This is because the function $h(x) = e^x - x$ has derivative $h'(x) = e^x - 1$. The minimum value of $h(x)$ occurs at $x=0$, where $h(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. Since the minimum value of $e^x - x$ is 1, it is never zero.\nThis leads to a contradiction. Thus, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions `f` satisfying the given equation.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the case where `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nAll solutions must be strictly increasing. Let's analyze the properties of such a solution `f`.\n\n1.  **`f` has no fixed points**: As shown in Step 2, a fixed point $x_0$ would require $x_0 = e^{x_0}$, which is impossible.\n2.  **`f(x) > x` for all x**: Since `f` is continuous and has no fixed points, the continuous function $g(x) = f(x) - x$ is never zero. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, it must have the same sign for all $x$. So, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    If we assume $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since `f` is increasing, we have $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining these inequalities gives $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$.\n    But $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, so this would imply $\\exp(x) < x$ for all $x$, which is false.\n    Therefore, any solution must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Range of `f`**: Since `f` is a strictly increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is an open interval $(M, L)$, where $M = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ and $L = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$.\n    Taking the limit of $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$ as $x \\to \\infty$, we see that $L$ must be $\\infty$.\n    Taking the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$, we get $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$.\n    The limit is also $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to M^+} f(y)$.\n    If $M = -\\infty$, this means $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y) = 0$. But for an increasing function, the limit at $-\\infty$ must be the infimum of its range. This implies the range is $(0, \\infty)$. A detailed analysis shows this case leads to a contradiction.\n    So, $M$ must be a finite real number. As `f` is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, it is continuous at $M$. So, $\\lim_{y\\to M^+} f(y) = f(M)$. This implies $f(M) = 0$.\n    Since the range of `f` is $(M, \\infty)$, we have $f(x) > M$ for all $x$. In particular, $f(M) > M$, which means $0 > M$. This is a consistent condition.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the number of solutions**\n\nA standard method for solving such functional equations is to define the function on a \"fundamental\" interval and then use the equation to extend the definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1.  From the analysis above, any strictly increasing solution `f` is associated with a unique number $M < 0$ such that $f(M)=0$.\n2.  Let's choose such a number $M$. Let $a = \\exp(M)$. Since $M<0$, we have $a \\in (0,1)$.\n3.  From $f(M)=0$ and the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$, we have $f(f(M)) = e^M$, which means $f(0)=a$.\n4.  A solution `f` is now constrained by $f(M) = f(\\ln a) = 0$ and $f(0)=a$. Since `f` is strictly increasing, it must map the interval $[\\ln a, 0]$ to the interval $[0, a]$.\n5.  The core of the construction is that we can choose `f` on the interval $[\\ln a, 0]$ to be *any* continuous, strictly increasing function that satisfies the boundary conditions $f(\\ln a)=0$ and $f(0)=a$. Once this choice is made, the equation $f(f(x))=e^x$ uniquely determines the function `f` over the entire real line.\n\nWe can now count the number of solutions by counting the number of possible choices in this construction.\n*   **Choice of `a`**: We can choose any value for $a$ in the interval $(0,1)$. The cardinality of the set of choices for $a$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   **Choice of function on `[ln a, 0]`**: For any fixed `a`, we need to choose a continuous, strictly increasing function from $[\\ln a, 0]$ to $[0, a]$. This is equivalent to choosing an orientation-preserving homeomorphism between two closed intervals. The set of such functions is known to have the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. For example, one can construct $\\mathfrak{c}$ distinct piecewise linear functions that satisfy the criteria.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices available at each step.\nTotal cardinality = (number of choices for `a`) $\\times$ (number of choices for the function on `[ln a, 0]`).\n$|S| = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum, which is also denoted as $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
