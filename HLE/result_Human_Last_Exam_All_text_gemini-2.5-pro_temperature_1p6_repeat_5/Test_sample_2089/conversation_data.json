    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific, Oscar-nominated film containing a very precise scene. The key elements are:\n    *   An Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   A character.\n    *   The character's fate is \"sealed\" (implying a tragic outcome like capture or death).\n    *   The trigger action is saying \"Thank you\".\n    *   The location of this action is while boarding a bus (or a similar public transport like a tram).\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Filtering:** We need to search our knowledge of films for a scene that matches all these criteria. The \"Oscar-nominated\" filter is crucial as it narrows the field considerably. Famous \"slip-up\" scenes in film history come to mind, but they must be cross-referenced with the bus and \"Thank you\" elements.\n    *   A common incorrect guess is *Inglourious Basterds* (2009). While it is an Oscar-nominated film with a famous scene where a character's cover is blown, the giveaway is a hand gesture (holding up three fingers the English way instead of the German way), and the scene takes place in a basement tavern, not on a bus.\n    *   The correct film deals with themes of hiding, identity, and the constant threat of discovery. This points toward historical dramas, particularly those set during World War II.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film:** The film that perfectly matches the description is Roman Polanski's **The Pianist** (2002).\n\n4.  **Verifying the \"Oscar-Nominated\" Criterion:** *The Pianist* was a major awards contender. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won three: Best Director (Roman Polanski), Best Adapted Screenplay (Ronald Harwood), and Best Actor (Adrien Brody). This criterion is met.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Specific Scene:**\n    *   **Context:** The scene occurs in Nazi-occupied Warsaw. Jewish people are in hiding, attempting to survive by passing as non-Jewish Poles. This is an incredibly dangerous act, as discovery means certain death or deportation to a concentration camp.\n    *   **The Character:** The scene does not involve the main character, Władysław Szpilman. It features an unnamed Jewish woman who is part of a family that the Szpilmans know.\n    *   **The Action:** The woman is attempting to board a public tram. She successfully gets on, blending in with the other passengers. In a moment of relief or ingrained politeness, she says \"Thank you\" in Polish (\"Dziękuję\").\n    *   **Sealing Her Fate:** The problem is not the words themselves, but her accent. A \"szmalcownik\" — a Polish local who would blackmail Jews or turn them over to the Nazis for a reward — is also on the tram. He overhears her and immediately detects the tell-tale Yiddish inflection in her pronunciation. The scene shows his face as he recognizes it, followed by the look of pure terror on her face as she realizes she has been discovered. Her single, polite phrase has given her away and sealed her fate.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Public Transport:** The vehicle is a tram or streetcar, which functions identically to a bus in the context of the scene (a public conveyance where one's identity can be exposed).\n*   **The Giveaway:** It is not the act of saying \"Thank you\" that is the problem, but the *accent* with which it is spoken. This highlights the constant, microscopic level of vigilance required to survive.\n*   **The Character:** It is important to remember this happens to a secondary character, not the film's protagonist, but it is a powerful and memorable scene that illustrates the peril faced by everyone.\n\nBy following these steps and considering the careful points, we can confidently identify the film.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Pianist>>>"
