    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:** The first step is to determine the starting health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, this value is **3,640 HP**. This is the base value upon which all multiplayer scaling is calculated.\n\n2.  **Determine the Multiplayer Scaling Formula:** In Terraria, boss health increases as more players join the world. The specific formula varies by difficulty mode. For Expert Mode, the source code specifies that a boss's health is increased by **35%** of its single-player base health for each additional player after the first.\n    *   Let `N` be the number of players.\n    *   The number of *additional* players is `(N - 1)`.\n    *   The health multiplier is `1 + (0.35 * (N - 1))`.\n\n3.  **Construct the Full Health Equation:** We can now create a complete function for the Eye of Cthulhu's total health, `H(N)`, based on the number of players `N`.\n    *   `H(N) = (Single-Player Expert Health) * (Multiplier)`\n    *   `H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Equation:** To analyze the function's behavior as the number of players grows, it is helpful to simplify the equation.\n    *   `H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n    *   `H(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n    *   `H(N) = (3640 * 0.65) + (3640 * 0.35)N`\n    *   `H(N) = 2366 + 1274N`\n    This simplified form clearly shows that the boss's health is a linear function of the number of players. For every player that joins, the Eye of Cthulhu's health increases by exactly 1,274.\n\n5.  **Evaluate for an Infinite Number of Players:** The question asks for the *theoretical maximum* health given an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to find the limit of the function `H(N)` as `N` approaches infinity (`∞`).\n    *   `lim (N -> ∞) [2366 + 1274N]`\n    *   As `N` increases without bound, the term `1274N` also increases without bound. The constant `2366` has a negligible impact on the final result at infinity.\n    *   Therefore, the limit of this function is infinity.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Theoretical vs. Practical:** The question is about the *theoretical* maximum based on the game's formula. In practice, the game has a player limit (typically 255) and the health value is stored in a data type (`int`) that has a maximum value (2,147,483,647). However, the scaling formula itself does not impose a cap.\n*   **Boss-Specific Scaling:** While most bosses follow this standard scaling rule, some have exceptions (e.g., segment-based bosses like the Eater of Worlds). The Eye of Cthulhu follows the standard rule.\n*   **Difficulty Modes:** The scaling factor of 35% is specific to Expert Mode. Classic Mode and Master Mode use different values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode increases linearly with the number of players and has no upper bound within its calculation formula. Consequently, with a theoretical infinite number of players, its health would also be infinite.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
