    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   It has a central benzene ring.\n    *   At position 1, there is an N,N-diethylbenzamide group [-C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂].\n    *   At position 3 (meta to the amide), there is a dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂].\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Conditions (Step 1):**\n    *   **Reagents:** The first step uses sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF (tetrahydrofuran).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**.\n    *   **sec-BuLi:** This is a very strong organolithium base used to deprotonate weakly acidic C-H bonds, particularly on aromatic rings.\n    *   **TMEDA:** This is a chelating agent that coordinates to the lithium ion, breaking down sec-BuLi aggregates and increasing its basicity and reactivity. It also helps in directing the lithiation.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds by having a \"Directing Metalation Group\" (DMG) on the aromatic ring coordinate to the lithium ion, which positions the base (sec-butyl anion) close to an adjacent (ortho) proton, facilitating its removal.\n\n3.  **Identify the Directing Metalation Groups (DMGs) and Determine the Site of Lithiation:**\n    *   The starting material has two potential DMGs: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group [-C(=O)N(Et)₂] and the dimethylamino group [-N(Me)₂].\n    *   The directing ability of various functional groups is well-established. The amide group (-CONR₂) is a significantly more powerful DMG than the amino group (-NR₂). Therefore, the deprotonation will occur at a position ortho to the amide group.\n    *   The positions ortho to the amide group (at C-1) are C-2 and C-6.\n    *   We must now consider the influence of the second group, the dimethylamino group at C-3.\n    *   The C-2 position is *ortho* to the primary director (the amide) and also *ortho* to the secondary director (the amino group).\n    *   The C-6 position is *ortho* to the primary director (the amide) but *para* to the secondary director.\n    *   The C-2 proton is activated by both directing groups, a phenomenon known as cooperative or synergistic directing effect. This makes the C-2 proton the most acidic on the ring and the most kinetically favorable site for deprotonation.\n    *   Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton from the C-2 position, forming an aryllithium intermediate: N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Step of the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reagent:** The second reagent is methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic quench.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The aryllithium intermediate generated in the first step is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion). It will attack the electrophilic methyl carbon of methyl iodide. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction where the carbanion displaces the iodide ion (I⁻).\n    *   **Result:** A methyl group (-CH₃) becomes attached to the C-2 position of the benzene ring, where the lithium atom was.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The reaction starts with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide and introduces a methyl group at the C-2 position.\n    *   The structure of the final product has the N,N-diethylbenzamide group at C-1, a new methyl group at C-2, and the original dimethylamino group at C-3.\n    *   The chemical name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize the reaction as a Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM).\n*   Correctly identify the relative directing strengths of the amide (-CONR₂) and amino (-NR₂) groups. The amide is the stronger director.\n*   Identify the site of lithiation by considering the positions ortho to the primary directing group.\n*   Recognize the cooperative directing effect where the second group (-NMe₂) reinforces deprotonation at one specific ortho position (C-2), making it the exclusive site of reaction.\n*   Understand that the aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile that will react with the electrophile (CH₃I) to form a new C-C bond.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
