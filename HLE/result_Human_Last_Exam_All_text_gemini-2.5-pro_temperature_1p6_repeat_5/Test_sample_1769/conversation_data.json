    "This is a question of historical and hypothetical linguistics. To answer it, we must trace the etymology of the word \"sister\" and determine how it would have evolved without a specific historical event.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Modern and Old English words:** The Modern English word is \"sister\". It originates from the Old English word *sweostor* (with an alternative spelling *swuster*).\n\n2.  **Identify the external influence:** Between the 7th and 12th centuries, Viking raids and the subsequent settlement of Norse-speakers in England (the Danelaw) introduced many Old Norse words into the English language. The Old Norse word for \"sister\" was *systir*.\n\n3.  **Analyze the influence:** Old English *sweostor* and Old Norse *systir* are cognates, meaning they both descend from the same Proto-Germanic root, **swestēr*. However, they had different pronunciations. The Modern English \"sister\" clearly follows the phonetic form of the Old Norse *systir* (particularly the 'i' vowel sound and the simpler 's' start), rather than the Old English *sweostor*. In Middle English, both the native forms (like *suster*) and the Norse-influenced form (*sister*) existed side-by-side, but the Norse version eventually became standard.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the development without Norse influence:** If the Norse had never invaded, the Old English word *sweostor* would have evolved according to English's own internal sound change rules. We can predict this path by looking at how similar words changed and by looking at English's closest linguistic relatives, like Frisian and Dutch.\n    *   The Old English form *sweostor* had a variant, *swuster*. This involved a common sound change where the initial `w` sound \"rounds\" the following vowel.\n    *   In the transition to Middle English, the initial `sw-` cluster was often simplified to `s-` before a vowel, and the unstressed final syllable weakened.\n    *   This would have turned Old English *swuster* into Middle English *suster*. This form was, in fact, common in southern and western English dialects where Norse influence was weakest.\n    *   Further evidence comes from cognate languages. West Frisian (English's closest relative) uses the word *suster*. Dutch uses *zuster*. This shows that this was a natural evolutionary path for the word in North Sea Germanic languages.\n\n5.  **Project to Modern English:** The final step is to project the Middle English *suster* into Modern English.\n    *   The vowel 'u' in Middle English *suster* was a short vowel, pronounced like the 'u' in \"put\".\n    *   During the Early Modern English period, this short /u/ sound widely shifted to the /ʌ/ sound (the \"STRUT\" vowel, as in \"cup\" or \"muster\").\n    *   Therefore, the pronunciation would have changed from /'sʊstər/ to /'sʌstər/.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English *sweostor* would have most likely evolved into the word *suster*. It would be pronounced to rhyme with \"muster\" or \"duster\".\n\n***\n\n**Careful points considered:**\n\n*   **Initial `sw-` vs `s-`:** While some `sw-` words kept the cluster (swim, swan), simplification was common (*so* from *swā*). The existence of ME *suster* and the Frisian/Dutch cognates strongly support simplification in this case.\n*   **Vowel change:** The evolution of the OE diphthong `eo` is complex, but the path via rounding to *swuster* and then to *suster* is well-attested and supported by comparative evidence.\n*   **Middle to Modern English Vowel Shift:** It's crucial to apply the correct vowel shift. The Great Vowel Shift affected long vowels, but the change from /ʊ/ to /ʌ/ was a different, later shift affecting short 'u'.\n*   **The alternative native path:** An alternative evolution could have been OE *sweostor* -> ME *swester* (rhyming with *fester*), similar to German *Schwester*. However, the form *suster* has stronger evidence from within Middle English dialects and from English's closest linguistic family members.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the projected natural evolution of the Old English word *sweostor* without Old Norse influence, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
