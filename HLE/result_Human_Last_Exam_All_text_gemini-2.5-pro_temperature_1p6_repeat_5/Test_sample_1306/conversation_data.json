    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the mathematical objects\nThe question is about the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$). Let's denote the algebra as $U_q$. We are interested in the category of its finite-dimensional representations. Let's call this category $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nThe question asks about the objects of \"the category of indecomposable finite-dimensional ... representations\". This is slightly non-standard phrasing. We interpret this as asking about the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects in the category $\\mathcal{F}$. Let's denote this set by $C$. We are asked to find what percentage of the objects in $C$ are irreducible.\n\n### Step 2: The role of the root of unity\nThe condition that $q$ is a primitive third root of unity means that $q^3=1$ and $q \\ne 1$. Let $l=3$ be the order of $q$. When $q$ is a root of unity, the representation theory of $U_q$ is significantly different from the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity). In the generic case, the category of finite-dimensional representations is semisimple, meaning every representation is a direct sum of irreducibles. In this case, all indecomposable representations are irreducible, so the percentage would be 100%.\n\nHowever, when $q$ is a root of unity, the category is **not** semisimple. This means there exist representations that are indecomposable but not irreducible (i.e., they are reducible). This makes the question non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Classification of indecomposable representations\nTo find the percentage, we need to understand the landscape of all indecomposable representations, both irreducible and reducible. The classification of indecomposable $U_q$-modules is known and depends on the action of the center of $U_q$, let's call it $Z_q$.\n\nFor any indecomposable module $V$, the elements of the center $Z_q$ must act as scalars (up to generalized eigenspaces). This gives a central character $\\chi: Z_q \\to \\mathbb{C}$. The set of all central characters, $\\mathrm{Spec}(Z_q)$, forms an algebraic variety. For $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, this variety is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^3$.\n\nThe classification of indecomposable modules can be broken down based on their central character $\\chi \\in \\mathbb{C}^3$.\n\n*   **Generic Central Characters:** There is a large subset of characters, let's call it $X_{reg} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^3$, for which the representation theory is simple. This subset is a Zariski-open and dense subset of $\\mathbb{C}^3$. For any character $\\chi \\in X_{reg}$, there is exactly one isomorphism class of irreducible modules $L_\\chi$, and it is the *only* indecomposable module with that central character. These \"generic\" irreducible modules all have dimension $l=3$.\n\n*   **Singular Central Characters:** The complement, $X_{sing} = \\mathbb{C}^3 \\setminus X_{reg}$, is a Zariski-closed subset of lower dimension (a surface, of dimension 2). For characters $\\chi \\in X_{sing}$, the situation is more complicated, and reducible indecomposable modules appear.\n    *   **\"Small quantum group\" type characters:** A special curve (dimension 1) within $X_{sing}$ corresponds to representations where certain central elements, $E^3$ and $F^3$, act as zero. These representations are essentially representations of the \"small quantum group\" $u_q$. For the small quantum group with $l=3$, the representation theory is \"tame\". The indecomposable modules consist of:\n        *   A finite number of \"discrete\" modules. Among them, only two are irreducible, with dimensions 1 and 2. The rest (including the projective modules of dimension 6) are reducible.\n        *   Infinite families of \"tubular\" modules. For each integer $k \\ge 1$, there's a continuous $\\mathbb{P}^1$-family of indecomposable modules of dimension $3k$. All of these are reducible.\n    *   **Other singular characters:** For other characters on the surface $X_{sing}$, the generic module $L_\\chi$ becomes reducible, giving rise to an indecomposable but reducible module of dimension 3.\n\n### Step 4: Interpreting \"Percentage\" and comparing the sets\nThe set $C$ of all indecomposable modules is infinite. To calculate a \"percentage\", we can compare the \"sizes\" of the subsets of irreducible and reducible indecomposable modules. In algebraic geometry, the standard way to do this is to compare the dimensions of the algebraic varieties that parameterize them.\n\n*   **Parameter Space of Irreducible Modules:**\n    1.  The largest family of irreducible modules are the generic ones, $L_\\chi$, parameterized by the 3-dimensional open set $X_{reg} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^3$.\n    2.  There are also smaller families of irreducibles, such as the 1- and 2-dimensional ones, but their parameters live on a 1-dimensional curve inside $X_{sing}$.\n    The total parameter space for irreducible modules is dominated by the generic family, so its dimension is 3.\n\n*   **Parameter Space of Reducible Indecomposable Modules:**\n    1.  The tubular modules for the \"small quantum group\" characters are parameterized by a space of dimension 2 (a 1D family of characters, and for each, a $\\mathbb{P}^1$-family of modules).\n    2.  Other reducible indecomposables are parameterized by the singular surface $X_{sing}$, which also has dimension 2.\n    The total parameter space for reducible indecomposable modules has dimension 2.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe set of all indecomposable modules is parameterized by a space of dimension $\\max(3, 2) = 3$.\nThe subset of irreducible modules is parameterized by a space of dimension 3.\nThe subset of reducible indecomposable modules is parameterized by a space of dimension 2.\n\nSince the irreducible modules correspond to a parameter space of the same dimension as the entire space of indecomposable modules, they form a Zariski-dense subset. In this sense, a \"generic\" indecomposable module is irreducible. The reducible indecomposables form a \"thin\" subset of lower dimension.\n\nThis is analogous to asking \"what percentage of complex square matrices are diagonalizable?\". The non-diagonalizable matrices form a subvariety of lower dimension, so the answer is 100%. Following this standard interpretation in algebraic geometry, the percentage of indecomposable modules that are irreducible is 100%."
