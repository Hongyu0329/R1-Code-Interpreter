    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Second Great War\"**: In StarCraft lore, the Second Great War refers to the galaxy-wide conflict that takes place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, *Legacy of the Void*) and its epilogue (*Into the Void*). The central conflict is the fight against the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, and his vast forces.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date**: The war begins at the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official in-game timeline, this is four years after the end of the Brood War (which ended in 2500). Therefore, the Second Great War began in the year **2504**. Key starting events include the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector and the resurgence of Raynor's Raiders.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date**: The war effectively ends with the final defeat of Amon. This climactic event occurs in the *Into the Void* epilogue campaign, which follows the main story of *Legacy of the Void*. These concluding events take place in the year **2506**. Events that follow, such as the *Nova Covert Ops* campaign (set in 2508), are considered to be post-war, dealing with the aftermath and new conspiracies rather than the war itself.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Duration**: The war started in 2504 and concluded in 2506.\n    *   *Wings of Liberty* campaign takes place in **2504**.\n    *   *Heart of the Swarm* campaign takes place in **2505**.\n    *   *Legacy of the Void* and the *Into the Void* epilogue take place in **2506**.\n    The conflict spans across these three consecutive years. While it did not last for three full 365-day years, its duration is certainly greater than two full years.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule**: The question requires the answer to be in years, **rounded up**. Since the war's duration spans from a point in 2504 to a point in 2506, its total length is more than 2 years. Rounding this value up to the next whole number gives a final duration of 3 years.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Defining the War's Scope**: It's crucial to correctly identify the start and end points. The war is defined by the struggle against Amon, not just any conflict in the era. Therefore, it starts with his re-emergence via the Zerg and ends with his ultimate destruction.\n*   **Excluding Post-War Events**: The *Nova Covert Ops* storyline is set two years after the war's conclusion and is not part of the Second Great War itself. Including it would incorrectly extend the duration.\n*   **Understanding \"Rounded Up\"**: This instruction is key. A duration of, for example, 2 years and 3 months must be rounded up to 3 years, not down to 2. Since the war's events stretch across parts of three different years, its duration is inherently more than two, necessitating the rounding up to three.\n\nBy following this analysis, the calculated duration of the Second Great War is 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
