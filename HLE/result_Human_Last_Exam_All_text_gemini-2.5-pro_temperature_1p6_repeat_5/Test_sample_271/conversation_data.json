    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe try to find common factors by rearranging the terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nWe can see a common factor of $(x^2 - 2)$.\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\n\n*   **Analysis of $g(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    The roots of $g(x)$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The splitting field of $g(x)$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K_g / \\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, denoted $C_2$.\n\n*   **Analysis of $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    1.  **Irreducibility:** We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n        *   The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 3.\n        *   All other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are divisible by 3.\n        *   The constant term, 3, is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n        Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n    2.  **Galois Group:** Since $h(x)$ is an irreducible quintic polynomial, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. To determine which one, we can analyze the number of real roots.\n        Let's find the derivative: $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$.\n        The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, so $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives two real critical points $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        *   At the local maximum $x = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$:\n            $h(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (-\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = - (9/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 > 0$.\n        *   At the local minimum $x = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$:\n            $h(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = (9/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} - 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = -(36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 < 0$, since $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 1$ and $36/5 > 3$.\n        Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $h(x)$ has exactly three real roots and thus two complex conjugate roots.\n        A standard theorem states that an irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group.\n        So, the Galois group of the splitting field $K_h$ of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of this extension is $|S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } h(x))$.\nThe Galois group of the compositum of two Galois extensions is the direct product of their individual Galois groups if their intersection is the base field.\nLet's find the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_h$.\nThe only quadratic subfield of $K_h$ (which has Galois group $S_5$) corresponds to the index-2 subgroup $A_5$. This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x)=x^5-9x+3$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1} (n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\nFor $h(x)$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 4^4 (-9)^5) = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 - 4^4 \\cdot 9^5 = 3^4(5^5 - 2^8 \\cdot 3^6) = 81(3125 - 256 \\cdot 729) = 81(3125 - 186624) = -14863419$.\nSince $D < 0$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = |C_2| \\times |S_5| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate extensions**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a sub-extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ (where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) is normal if and only if its corresponding Galois subgroup, $\\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G : \\text{Gal}(K/L)] = |G|/|\\text{Gal}(K/L)|$.\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means we are looking for proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$**\n\nLet's list the normal subgroups of $C_2$ and $S_5$.\n*   Normal subgroups of $C_2$: $\\{e_{C_2}\\}, C_2$.\n*   Normal subgroups of $S_5$: $\\{e_{S_5}\\}, A_5, S_5$. (For $n\\geq 5$, $A_n$ is the only proper non-trivial normal subgroup of $S_n$).\n\nLet $H$ be a normal subgroup of $C_2 \\times S_5$. The classification of such subgroups yields the following list of proper, non-trivial normal subgroups:\n1.  $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e_{S_5}\\}$: $|H_1| = 2$.\n2.  $H_2 = \\{e_{C_2}\\} \\times A_5$: $|H_2| = |A_5| = 60$.\n3.  $H_3 = C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H_3| = 2 \\times 60 = 120$.\n4.  $H_4 = \\{e_{C_2}\\} \\times S_5$: $|H_4| = |S_5| = 120$.\n5.  $H_5 = \\{ (\\text{sgn}(\\sigma), \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in S_5 \\}$, where sgn: $S_5 \\to C_2$ is the sign homomorphism. This is a \"diagonal\" subgroup. Its elements are of the form $(e, \\sigma)$ for $\\sigma \\in A_5$ and $(c, \\sigma)$ for $\\sigma \\notin A_5$ (where $c$ is the non-identity element of $C_2$). $|H_5| = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the degrees of the corresponding normal extensions**\n\nThe possible degrees are the indices of these normal subgroups in $G$.\n*   For $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e_{S_5}\\}$: Degree = $|G|/|H_1| = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n*   For $H_2 = \\{e_{C_2}\\} \\times A_5$: Degree = $|G|/|H_2| = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n*   For $H_3 = C_2 \\times A_5$: Degree = $|G|/|H_3| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n*   For $H_4 = \\{e_{C_2}\\} \\times S_5$: Degree = $|G|/|H_4| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n*   For $H_5$ (the diagonal subgroup): Degree = $|G|/|H_5| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n\nThe distinct values for the degrees of these extensions are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nThus, the set of all possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
