    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the specific name of the \"value\" that is computed \"between heartbeats\" to measure Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The context given is that this value is captured from beat-to-beat intervals using a technology called PPG.\n\n2.  **Understand HRV:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is not a single value but a collection of metrics that quantify the variation in time between successive heartbeats. The fundamental building block for all HRV calculations is the measurement of the time that elapses from one heartbeat to the next.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Measurement:** The \"value between heartbeats\" is a time duration. This duration is the raw data point used to analyze variability. For example, a series of these durations might look like: 800 ms, 820 ms, 790 ms, 815 ms, etc. The question is asking what this individual time duration (e.g., 800 ms) is called.\n\n4.  **Consider the Standard Terminology (from ECG):** The gold standard for measuring HRV is an electrocardiogram (ECG). On an ECG trace, the most prominent peak of a heartbeat is called the \"R-wave\". The time interval measured from the peak of one R-wave to the peak of the next consecutive R-wave is called the **R-R interval**. This is the most common and widely recognized term in scientific and medical literature for the beat-to-beat interval.\n\n5.  **Consider the Specific Technology Mentioned (PPG):** The question specifies that Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used. PPG does not measure the heart's electrical signals (like ECG); instead, it measures blood volume changes, creating a pulse wave. The time between consecutive peaks of this pulse wave is measured.\n    *   A technically precise term for this measurement from PPG is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n    *   Another specific term is **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)**.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Determine the Best Answer:** While **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** is a very accurate and general term, the term **R-R interval** is overwhelmingly used in the context of HRV, even when the data is sourced from PPG. The PPG-derived IBI is treated as an estimate or a proxy for the true ECG-derived R-R interval. Therefore, in the field of HRV, the beat-to-beat interval is most commonly referred to as the R-R interval, regardless of the capture technology.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **HRV vs. R-R Interval:** Do not confuse HRV with the R-R interval. The R-R interval (or IBI) is the raw measurement *between* beats. HRV is the statistical analysis performed *on a series* of these R-R intervals (e.g., calculating the standard deviation of all the R-R intervals, known as SDNN).\n*   **Technology Nuance:** Be aware that \"R-R interval\" technically refers to a measurement from an ECG. However, it has become the standard term in the HRV field for the beat-to-beat interval, even when using other technologies like PPG.\n*   **Units:** This value is a duration of time, typically measured in milliseconds (ms).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats, which serves as the fundamental data for calculating HRV, is the time duration between them. The most common and widely accepted name for this value is the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval (or Inter-Beat Interval, IBI)"
