    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the given Wittig reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their structures.**\n\nThe Wittig reaction involves an aldehyde or a ketone reacting with a phosphonium ylide. The reactants given are:\n1.  **Pivalaldehyde:** This is the common name for 2,2-dimethylpropanal. The \"pival\" group is a synonym for the *tert*-butylcarbonyl group. The structure consists of a *tert*-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C-, attached to an aldehyde functional group, -CHO.\n    Structure of pivalaldehyde:\n    ```\n        O\n       //\n    (CH₃)₃C-C-H\n    ```\n\n2.  **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-$\\lambda^5$-phosphane:** This is the phosphonium ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n    *   **triphenyl-$\\lambda^5$-phosphane:** This refers to the P(C₆H₅)₃ (or PPh₃) group, where the phosphorus is in a +5 formal oxidation state, characteristic of the ylide form (P⁺-C⁻ or P=C).\n    *   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene):** This describes the organic group attached to the phosphorus atom via a double bond.\n        *   An `ethylidene` group has the structure CH₃-CH=. The double bond indicates the point of attachment to the phosphorus.\n        *   The prefix `2-(2-chlorophenyl)` indicates that a `2-chlorophenyl` group is attached to carbon-2 of the ethylidene group. Carbon-1 is the one double-bonded to phosphorus.\n        *   So, we start with CH₃-CH=PPh₃ and replace one hydrogen on the methyl group (C-2) with a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n    Structure of the ylide:\n    ```\n           Cl\n          /\n        (phenyl ring)\n        /\n       CH₂\n       |\n       CH=P(C₆H₅)₃\n    ```\n    This can be written as (2-ClC₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction mechanism and predict the product's connectivity.**\n\nThe Wittig reaction replaces the carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) of the aldehyde with the carbon-phosphorus double bond (C=P) of the ylide. This results in the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O) as a byproduct.\n\n*   From pivalaldehyde, the fragment is: (CH₃)₃C-CH=\n*   From the ylide, the fragment is: =(CH)-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\nJoining these two fragments at the double bond gives the alkene product:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the product.**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the newly formed double bond (E or Z) depends on the nature of the ylide.\n\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (with electron-withdrawing groups like -C=O, -CN on the ylide carbon) are less reactive and typically yield the thermodynamically more stable (E)-alkene.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides** (with alkyl or H on the ylide carbon) are more reactive and typically yield the kinetically favored (Z)-alkene.\n\nLet's analyze our ylide: (2-ClC₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃. The carbon atom double-bonded to phosphorus is attached to a hydrogen atom and a 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group, -(CH₂)-(C₆H₄Cl). This group is an alkyl-type substituent; it cannot stabilize the negative charge of the ylide carbanion through resonance. Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**.\n\nFor reactions between non-stabilized ylides and aldehydes, the major product is the **(Z)-alkene**.\n\n**Step 4: Name the final product.**\n\nFirst, we need to assign the (Z) configuration to the product structure: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\n1.  **Identify priority groups** on each carbon of the double bond using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    *   On the carbon attached to the *tert*-butyl group: The *tert*-butyl group, -C(CH₃)₃, has higher priority than the hydrogen atom, -H.\n    *   On the carbon attached to the 2-chlorobenzyl group: The 2-chlorobenzyl group, -CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), has higher priority than the hydrogen atom, -H.\n\n2.  **Assign Z/E:**\n    *   (Z)-isomer: The two higher-priority groups are on the *same side* of the double bond.\n    *   (E)-isomer: The two higher-priority groups are on *opposite sides* of the double bond.\n    Since the reaction yields the (Z)-isomer, the *tert*-butyl group and the 2-chlorobenzyl group are on the same side of the double bond.\n\n3.  **IUPAC Name:**\n    *   Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond:\n        (2-ClC₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=CH-C(CH₃)₃\n                      1    2   3    4\n      The chain is a pentene chain (5 carbons).\n    *   Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant. Numbering from the end closer to the phenyl group gives the double bond starting at C-2.\n        `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`\n    *   Combine with the stereochemical descriptor.\n\nThe final product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<The product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.>>>"
