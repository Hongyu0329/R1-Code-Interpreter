    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a theory in population ethics that evaluates the goodness of a population. It states that the total value of a population is the sum of the \"utility\" of each person's life, but only after subtracting a fixed positive value, the \"critical level\" (*c*).\n\n*   **Value of a population = Σ (uᵢ - c)**, where *uᵢ* is the utility (or welfare level) of person *i*, and *c* is the critical level.\n*   We assume *c* is a positive number (*c* > 0). This means the critical level corresponds to a life that is worth living (since utility > 0 means a life is worth living).\n*   According to this view, adding a new person to the world with utility *u* is a good thing only if their utility is above the critical level (*u* > *c*). If their utility is positive but below the critical level (0 < *u* < *c*), adding them actually makes the world a worse place, because the value contributed, (*u* - *c*), is negative.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's theorem states that no population axiology can simultaneously satisfy a set of five conditions that seem, on their own, to be very plausible. Any consistent theory must therefore violate at least one of them. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n**A. Egalitarian Dominance:** If two populations have the same number of people, and in Population A everyone is at least as well-off as their counterpart in Population B and at least one person is strictly better off, then A is better than B.\n*   **Test with Critical-Level View:** This condition is satisfied. If everyone in A is better off, the sum of `(u - c)` for A will necessarily be higher than the sum for B.\n\n**D. Weak Non-Sadism:** There is at least one negative welfare level (*v* < 0) such that adding a person with that welfare level always makes the outcome worse.\n*   **Test with Critical-Level View:** This condition is satisfied. For a person with negative utility *v*, the value added is (*v* - *c*). Since *v* is negative and *c* is positive, (*v* - *c*) is always a negative number. Thus, adding such a person always makes the total value lower.\n\n**E. Weak Quality Addition:** There is at least one positive welfare level (*w* > 0) such that adding a person with that welfare level always makes the outcome better.\n*   **Test with Critical-Level View:** This condition is satisfied. We just need to find *one* such welfare level *w*. We can choose any welfare level that is higher than the critical level, for instance, *w = c + 1*. Since we assume *c* > 0, this *w* is also positive. For this chosen *w*, the value added is (*w* - *c*) = (*c* + 1 - *c*) = 1. Since the added value is positive, this addition always makes the outcome better, regardless of the initial population.\n\n**B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This is a technical condition giving priority to quality over quantity in certain cases. It states that for any welfare level, there's a higher level where a sufficient number of people at the higher level can outweigh one person at the lower level when added to any existing population.\n*   **Test with Critical-Level View:** Critical-level views generally satisfy this complex condition. The structure `k(x-c) ≥ y-c` can always be satisfied by picking an appropriate *k* or a suitable higher level *x*.\n\n**C. Non-Elitism:** This condition states that quality is not all that matters; quantity can compensate. A simplified version is: for any two high welfare levels *x* and *y* (with *x > y*), a sufficiently large population of people at level *y* is better than a small population of people at level *x*. The condition is meant to ensure that we don't consider a few \"super-lives\" to be better than any number of \"merely excellent\" lives.\n*   **Test with Critical-Level View:** This is the condition that critical-level views violate. To see why, we can strategically choose the welfare levels *x* and *y* in relation to the critical level *c*.\n    1.  Let's choose a very high welfare level *x* that is **above** the critical level (e.g., *x = c + 10*).\n    2.  Let's choose a high, but slightly lower, welfare level *y* that is **below** the critical level (e.g., *y = c - 1*). We can assume *c* > 1 so that *y* is still a positive welfare level (a life worth living).\n    3.  Now, consider a small population at level *x*, say one person. Its total value is `(x - c) = (c + 10 - c) = 10`. This is a positive value.\n    4.  Next, consider a population of *m* people at level *y*. Its total value is `m * (y - c) = m * (c - 1 - c) = -m`. This is a negative value for any *m > 0*.\n    5.  The Non-Elitism condition requires that for a large enough number of people *m*, the population at level *y* should be considered better than the population at level *x*.\n    6.  However, with a critical-level view, this is impossible. The value `-m` can never be greater than `10`. No matter how large *m* gets, the total value of the population at level *y* remains negative, while the value of the population at level *x* is positive. A negative value cannot be better than a positive one.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCritical-level views create a sharp divide at the critical level *c*. Any number of people whose lives are good, but fall below this line, contribute negatively to the total value. This makes it impossible for them to ever outweigh even one person whose life is above the line. This behavior is a violation of the **Non-Elitism** condition.\n\n<<<C>>>"
