    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question \"How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\".\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Question and Define \"Triple Crown\"**\n\nThe first step is to understand that the term \"Triple Crown\" in Major League Baseball can refer to two different achievements: one for batters and one for pitchers. To answer the question accurately, we must consider both.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n    1.  Batting Average\n    2.  Home Runs\n    3.  Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their respective league in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n    1.  Wins\n    2.  Strikeouts\n    3.  Earned Run Average (ERA)\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown Winners**\n\nNext, we list and count the instances of the Batting Triple Crown being won and the number of unique players who have accomplished it.\n\n*   **Number of times achieved:** The Batting Triple Crown has been won **17 times** in MLB history.\n*   **List of achievements:**\n    *   1878: Paul Hines (NL)\n    *   1887: Tip O'Neill (American Association - recognized by MLB)\n    *   1894: Hugh Duffy (NL)\n    *   1901: Nap Lajoie (AL)\n    *   1909: Ty Cobb (AL)\n    *   1922: Rogers Hornsby (NL)\n    *   1925: Rogers Hornsby (NL)\n    *   1933: Chuck Klein (NL)\n    *   1933: Jimmie Foxx (AL)\n    *   1934: Lou Gehrig (AL)\n    *   1937: Joe Medwick (NL)\n    *   1942: Ted Williams (AL)\n    *   1947: Ted Williams (AL)\n    *   1956: Mickey Mantle (AL)\n    *   1966: Frank Robinson (AL)\n    *   1967: Carl Yastrzemski (AL)\n    *   2012: Miguel Cabrera (AL)\n*   **Careful Point:** Note that two players won the award more than once. Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won it twice.\n*   **Number of unique players (winners):** By counting each player only once, we find there are **15 unique Batting Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown Winners**\n\nNow, we do the same analysis for the Pitching Triple Crown.\n\n*   **Number of times achieved:** The Pitching Triple Crown has been won **35 times** in MLB history.\n*   **Careful Point:** Several pitchers have won the award multiple times.\n    *   3-time winners: Walter Johnson, Pete Alexander, Sandy Koufax\n    *   2-time winners: Christy Mathewson, Lefty Grove, Roger Clemens\n*   **Number of unique players (winners):** Despite the 35 occurrences, a smaller number of individual pitchers have earned this honor. Counting each pitcher only once, we find there are **26 unique Pitching Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Triple Crown Winners**\n\nThe final step is to combine the results to answer the user's question. The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which most accurately refers to the total number of unique individuals who have accomplished the feat.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must check if any player has won both a Batting and a Pitching Triple Crown. A review of the lists shows that no player in MLB history has accomplished this.\n*   **Calculation:** We can simply add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners.\n    *   Unique Batting Winners: 15\n    *   Unique Pitching Winners: 26\n    *   Total Unique Winners = 15 + 26 = 41\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBy analyzing both the Batting and Pitching Triple Crowns and counting the total number of unique players who have achieved either honor, we arrive at the final number.\n\n<<<41>>>"
