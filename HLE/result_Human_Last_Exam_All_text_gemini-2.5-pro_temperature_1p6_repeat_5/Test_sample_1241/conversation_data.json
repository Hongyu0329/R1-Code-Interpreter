    "This problem requires finding the stationary (or equilibrium) distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain. The stationary distribution, denoted by $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ for each state $i$, is the long-term probability of the system being in state $i$. The stationary distribution is found by setting the time derivatives of the probabilities to zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Formulate the steady-state equations**\nBy setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ and $P_i(t) = p_i$ in the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations, also known as the balance equations:\n(1) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n(2) $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n(3) $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n(4) $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n\nWe also have the normalization condition, which states that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n(5) $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n**2. Substitute the given parameter values**\nThe given transition rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nSubstituting these values into the balance equations:\n(1) $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n(3) $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2 \\implies 0 = 0.4 p_1 - 0.4 p_2$\n(4) $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\n\n**3. Solve the system of linear equations**\nWe can solve this system by expressing each probability in terms of one of them, for example, $p_1$.\n\n*   From equation (4):\n    $0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$\n\n*   From equation (3):\n    $0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$\n\n*   Combining these results, we have:\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$\n\n*   From equation (1):\n    $0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$\n\n**4. Use the normalization condition**\nNow we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019})p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) p_1 = 1$\n\nLet's solve for $p_1$:\n$p_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**5. Calculate the required sum**\nThe question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$.\n\nFirst, we find $p_0$ in terms of $p_1$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nNow, we compute the sum $p_0 + p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n**6. Final calculation**\nTo get the final numerical answer, we compute the value of the fraction:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding the result to six decimal places, we get 0.946252.\n\n### Careful points:\n*   The problem asks for the stationary probabilities, which means setting the time derivatives to zero.\n*   It's important to use all the equations correctly, including the normalization condition $p_0+p_1+p_2+p_3=1$. The system of differential equations implies that one of the balance equations is redundant, so we use three of them plus the normalization condition.\n*   The specific numerical values for $\\lambda_{ij}$ lead to significant simplifications ($p_1=p_2=p_3$). It's crucial to perform the arithmetic operations accurately to spot these simplifications. For instance, $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$, which equals $\\lambda_{12}$. Also, $\\lambda_{23} = \\lambda_{31}$.\n*   The final question is about the sum $p_0+p_1$, not the individual probabilities.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$ is $\\frac{669}{707}$.\n$669 \\div 707 \\approx 0.946251768$\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
