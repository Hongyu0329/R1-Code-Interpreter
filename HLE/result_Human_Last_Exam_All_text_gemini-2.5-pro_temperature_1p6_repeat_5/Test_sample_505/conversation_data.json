    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding:**\n    *   **Surface Code Patch:** A surface code is implemented on a 2D grid of physical qubits. A \"patch\" refers to a single, contiguous area of this code. A standard, simple rectangular patch with well-defined boundaries can encode one logical qubit. The logical X and Z operators are defined as strings of physical Pauli operators that connect opposite boundaries of the patch.\n    *   **Holes:** A hole is a region within a patch where stabilizer measurements are intentionally omitted. This creates an inner boundary. Topologically, each hole provides the structure to encode one additional logical qubit. A new pair of logical operators can be defined: one as a closed loop of Pauli operators around the hole, and the other as a string connecting the hole to the outer boundary (or another hole).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Encoding Capacity of a Single Patch:**\n    *   Based on the principles above, a single patch of surface code with $h$ holes can encode $k$ logical qubits, where:\n        $k = 1$ (from the patch's outer boundaries) $+ h$ (from the number of holes).\n    *   So, for a single patch, the formula is $k = 1 + h$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the System Configuration:**\n    *   The problem specifies a system with **two separate patches** and a total of **two holes**.\n    *   Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each patch.\n        $k_{total} = k_{patch1} + k_{patch2}$\n\n4.  **Enumerate Possible Hole Distributions:**\n    *   The two holes can be distributed between the two patches in the following ways:\n        *   **Case A:** Two holes in the first patch and zero holes in the second.\n        *   **Case B:** One hole in the first patch and one hole in the second.\n        (The case of zero holes in the first patch and two in the second is symmetric to Case A and gives the same total).\n\n5.  **Calculate Logical Qubits for Each Case:**\n\n    *   **Case A: (2 holes in Patch 1, 0 holes in Patch 2)**\n        *   Logical qubits in Patch 1: $k_1 = 1 + h_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n        *   Logical qubits in Patch 2: $k_2 = 1 + h_2 = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n        *   Total logical qubits for Case A: $k_{total} = k_1 + k_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n    *   **Case B: (1 hole in Patch 1, 1 hole in Patch 2)**\n        *   Logical qubits in Patch 1: $k_1 = 1 + h_1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n        *   Logical qubits in Patch 2: $k_2 = 1 + h_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n        *   Total logical qubits for Case B: $k_{total} = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Maximum Number:**\n    *   Both possible configurations for distributing the two holes among the two patches result in a total of 4 logical qubits.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The key is that each separate patch acts as an independent resource that can store at least one logical qubit. The total capacity is the sum of the capacities of the individual patches.\n*   **Additive Nature of Holes:** Each hole adds one logical qubit to the total count, regardless of which patch it is located in.\n*   **General Formula:** We can derive a general formula. If you have $N_p$ patches and a total of $N_h$ holes, the total number of logical qubits $k_{total}$ is:\n    $k_{total} = (\\text{qubits from patches}) + (\\text{qubits from holes}) = N_p + N_h$.\n    In this problem, $N_p = 2$ and $N_h = 2$, so $k_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$. This confirms the result is independent of the hole distribution.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from the patches themselves and the qubits from the holes. With two patches and two holes, this is $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
