    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The central query is to determine which person's lectures were cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905 scientific paper concerning Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Work:** In 1905, Einstein published a paper in the journal *Annalen der Physik* titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This is his landmark paper on Brownian motion.\n\n3.  **Examine the Citations in the Paper:** A key characteristic of Einstein's 1905 papers is the notable absence of citations to other scientists' work. He built his arguments from first principles. Upon examining the published paper on Brownian motion, it becomes clear that it contains no citations or references to anyone's lectures.\n\n4.  **Consider Related Works from 1905:** This is the most crucial step. While the *published paper* lacks the citation, Einstein completed another major work in 1905: his doctoral dissertation for the University of Zurich. This dissertation, titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"), is thematically and mathematically very closely linked to the Brownian motion paper. Both works aimed to prove the existence of atoms and determine their size.\n\n5.  **Examine the Dissertation's Acknowledgements:** Einstein's PhD advisor was the professor of experimental physics, Alfred Kleiner. In the dedication of his dissertation, Einstein specifically acknowledged his advisor. He wrote a sentence mentioning that his arguments were similar to those presented in lectures by Professor Kleiner on the same subject.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The question specifically mentions a \"1905 paper on Brownian motion\" and the citation of \"lectures\".\n    *   Strictly speaking, the *Annalen der Physik* paper on Brownian motion contains no such citation.\n    *   However, his doctoral dissertation from the exact same year, on a nearly identical topic, *does* contain a specific citation to the lectures of his advisor.\n    *   It is a widely accepted historical fact that this is the reference the question is alluding to, as it is the only instance of Einstein citing lectures in his foundational 1905 work on molecular reality.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinction between Works:** It is important to distinguish between the paper published in *Annalen der Physik* and the doctoral dissertation submitted to the University of Zurich. They are two separate documents, although written in the same year on closely related topics.\n*   **Literal Interpretation vs. Historical Context:** A strictly literal interpretation focusing only on the paper \"On the Motion of Small Particles...\" would lead to the answer \"no one\". However, understanding the historical context and the common knowledge about Einstein's relationship with his advisor points toward the citation in the dissertation.\n*   **Specificity of \"Lectures\":** The question's use of the word \"lectures\" is a strong clue, pointing directly to the specific acknowledgement Einstein made to his professor, rather than a more general influence or citation of a published work.\n\nBased on this analysis, the person whose lectures Einstein cited was his PhD advisor.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is an individual's name.\n\n<<<Alfred Kleiner>>>"
