    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of each term.**\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of the variation in a trait (phenotype) that is explained by the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It is considered the theoretical *upper limit* of prediction accuracy that one could ever achieve using only these common SNPs. It assumes you know the true effect size of every single SNP.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool. A PGS is a single score calculated for an individual based on their genotype. It is a weighted sum of the number of trait-associated alleles the individual possesses. The weights (effect sizes for each SNP) are *estimated* from a real-world dataset, typically a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is a measure of how well a calculated PGS can predict the actual phenotype in a *new, independent* group of individuals. It is most commonly measured by R², which is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the PGS in that new sample.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the two concepts.**\n*   SNP heritability is the *target* or the *ceiling*. It's the total amount of variance that is potentially explainable.\n*   The predictive ability of a PGS is the *achieved* performance. It's how much variance we can *actually* explain with our current tools and data.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the factors that limit the predictive ability of a PGS.**\nThe reason a PGS doesn't reach the theoretical ceiling of SNP heritability is due to several practical limitations:\n1.  **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The SNP weights used in a PGS are derived from a GWAS of a finite number of people. This means the estimated weights have statistical error and are not the \"true\" effect sizes. A larger GWAS provides more accurate weights and a better PGS, but no real-world GWAS has an infinite sample size to find the perfect weights.\n2.  **Imperfect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Modeling:** Genes that are physically close on a chromosome are often inherited together (a phenomenon called LD). Statistical methods used to build PGS try to account for this, but these models are not perfect. This means the contribution of some SNPs might be over- or under-estimated.\n3.  **Incomplete Information:** A PGS is typically built using a subset of all SNPs (e.g., those passing a certain significance threshold), not every single SNP that contributes to heritability.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nBecause the PGS is constructed using imperfect information (noisy effect size estimates from a finite sample, imperfect LD correction, etc.), its ability to explain variance will inherently be less than the total variance that is theoretically available to be explained (the SNP heritability). The predictive ability of a PGS *approaches* the SNP heritability as the size of the discovery GWAS approaches infinity, but it can never exceed it and will not equal it in any practical scenario. Therefore, the predictive ability is *necessarily* lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe statement is True. The SNP heritability represents the theoretical maximum proportion of variance that can be explained by common SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical predictor built from a finite discovery sample (like a GWAS), which means its estimated SNP effects are imperfect. Due to this estimation error and other modeling limitations, the variance explained by the PGS in an independent sample will be lower than this theoretical maximum.\n\n<<<True>>>"
