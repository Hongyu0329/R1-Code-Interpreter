    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific painting: a 1933 self-portrait by the German artist Curt Querner.\n\n2.  **Establish the Historical Context:** The question provides a crucial piece of information: the portrait was painted *after* Querner had escaped from the Gestapo (the Nazi secret police). This context is key to understanding the symbolism in the artwork. Querner was a member of the Communist Party and was among the first political opponents arrested by the Nazis in 1933.\n\n3.  **Locate and Examine the Artwork:** The painting in question is titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe), created in 1933. Examining images or descriptions of this work reveals the artist staring intently at the viewer. In his right hand, which is prominently featured in the foreground, he holds an object.\n\n4.  **Identify the Object:** The object Querner is holding is a **pipe**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Symbolism (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Context is Everything:** Simply holding a pipe is not inherently an act of resistance. However, given that Querner was a fugitive from the Gestapo, every choice in the portrait becomes significant.\n    *   **Assertion of Identity:** The act of painting a self-portrait is itself an act of defiance. In a time when the regime sought to erase his identity and existence, Querner documented himself with unyielding presence.\n    *   **Symbol of Calm and Normalcy:** The pipe represents an object of everyday life, of quiet contemplation and routine. By including it, Querner projects an image of calm and normalcy, refusing to be portrayed as a broken or terrified victim. It's a quiet insistence on his own humanity and inner steadfastness against the chaos and terror outside.\n    *   **Quiet Resistance:** This is not a grand, heroic gesture but a form of passive, personal resistance. It symbolizes a refusal to let the oppressors dictate his inner state. The combination of his intense, direct gaze and the mundane pipe creates a powerful statement of self-assertion and defiance.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBy combining these points, we can conclude that the object held by Curt Querner in his 1933 self-portrait is a pipe, and it serves as a symbol of his quiet, personal resistance and his determination to maintain his identity and humanity while being persecuted by the Gestapo.\n\n<<<He holds a pipe.>>>"
