    "This problem requires finding a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear time-invariant system to place the closed-loop poles (eigenvalues) at specific locations.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n*   The system matrices are given as:\n    `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   The state feedback control results in a closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF`.\n*   The desired eigenvalues for `A_cl` are `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n*   The state vector `x` is 2x1 and the input vector `u` is 2x1 (inferred from B being 2x2). Therefore, the feedback gain matrix `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let's denote it as:\n    `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial is formed from the desired eigenvalues (`λ_1`, `λ_2`).\n`p_desired(λ) = (λ - λ_1)(λ - λ_2)`\n`p_desired(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_desired(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`p_desired(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p_desired(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`p_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\nThis is the target characteristic polynomial for our closed-loop system.\n\n**3. Calculate the Closed-Loop System's Characteristic Polynomial**\nFirst, we compute the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` in terms of the unknown elements of `F`.\n*   `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n*   `A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n    `A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\nNext, we find the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`, which is `det(λI - A_cl)`.\n*   `λI - A_cl = [[λ - (-1 + f1 + 2*f3), -(1 + f2 + 2*f4)], [-(1 + f1), λ - f2]]`\n    `λI - A_cl = [[λ + 1 - f1 - 2*f3, -1 - f2 - 2*f4], [-1 - f1, λ - f2]]`\n*   `det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 - f1 - 2*f3)(λ - f2) - (-1 - f2 - 2*f4)(-1 - f1)`\n    `= λ^2 - f2*λ + (1 - f1 - 2*f3)*λ - f2*(1 - f1 - 2*f3) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `= λ^2 + (1 - f1 - 2*f2 - 2*f3)λ + (-f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3) - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `= λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**4. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\nWe now equate the coefficients of our calculated polynomial with the desired polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n*   Comparing coefficients of `λ^1`:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3 = 2`\n    `=> f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n*   Comparing coefficients of `λ^0` (the constant term):\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `=> f1 + 2*f2 - 2*f2*f3 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4 = -3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point:** We have two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This indicates that the system is underdetermined, and there is no unique solution for `F`. We can find one valid solution by making a simplifying assumption. A common strategy is to set some of the elements of `F` to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This simplifies our system of equations significantly:\n*   Equation 1 becomes: `f1 + f2 = -1`\n*   Equation 2 becomes: `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n\nNow we solve this simple linear system:\n*   Subtract the first new equation from the second:\n    `(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n    `f2 = -2`\n*   Substitute `f2 = -2` back into `f1 + f2 = -1`:\n    `f1 + (-2) = -1`\n    `f1 = 1`\n\n**5. State the Final Answer**\nBased on our calculations, one possible state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check our answer. With `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`, the closed-loop matrix is:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1 + 1 + 0, 1 + (-2) + 0], [1 + 1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThe roots of this equation are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4-8))/2 = -1 ± j`. The verification is successful.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
