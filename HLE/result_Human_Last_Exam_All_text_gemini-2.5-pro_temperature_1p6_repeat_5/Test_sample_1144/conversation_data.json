    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the principles and given information.**\nThe problem requires us to combine two fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics:\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This relates the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$).\n2.  **Bohr's Model of the Atom:** This provides a value for the momentum ($p$) of an electron in a specific orbit.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$).\n*   The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n**Goal:**\n*   Find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.**\nThe principle is given by the relation:\n$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant ($h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}$).\n\nFor this problem, we will assume the minimum possible uncertainty, so we use the equality:\n$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\nRearranging for $\\Delta p$, we get:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.**\nAccording to Bohr's model, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in the n-th orbit is quantized:\n$L = m_e v r_n = \\frac{nh}{2\\pi}$\nwhere $m_e$ is the electron mass, $v$ is its velocity, and $r_n$ is the orbit's radius.\n\nThe linear momentum is $p = m_e v$. Substituting this into the angular momentum equation:\n$p \\cdot r_n = \\frac{nh}{2\\pi}$\n\nRearranging for the momentum $p$:\n$p = \\frac{nh}{2\\pi r_n}$\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, and the radius $r_1$ is the Bohr radius, $a_0$.\nSo, the momentum is:\n$p = \\frac{h}{2\\pi r_1}$\n\n**Step 4: Form the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$ and simplify.**\nNow we can construct the ratio using the expressions from Step 2 and Step 3:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x} \\right) }{ \\left( \\frac{h}{2\\pi r_1} \\right) }$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by inverting the denominator and multiplying:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x} \\times \\frac{2\\pi r_1}{h}$\n\nThe terms $h$ and $2\\pi$ cancel out, leaving a very simple relationship:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the numerical values and calculate the final answer.**\nWe need the values for the Bohr radius ($r_1$) and the given uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$).\n*   Bohr radius, $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into our simplified ratio formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial to use consistent units. The position uncertainty was given in picometers (pm) and needed to be converted to meters (m) to match the units of the Bohr radius.\n2.  **Minimum Uncertainty:** The problem implies using the minimum uncertainty from Heisenberg's principle, which allows us to use the equality $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = h/(4\\pi)$ rather than the inequality.\n3.  **Bohr Model Formulas:** Ensure you are using the correct formula for momentum derived from the quantization of angular momentum in the Bohr model ($L = nh/(2\\pi)$).\n4.  **Correct Constants:** Use the standard value for the Bohr radius, $a_0 = r_1 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11}$ m.\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification:** Simplifying the ratio expression algebraically before plugging in numbers is often easier and less prone to calculation errors. It also reveals the underlying physical relationship more clearly (in this case, the ratio depends only on the radii and position uncertainty, not on Planck's constant).\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
