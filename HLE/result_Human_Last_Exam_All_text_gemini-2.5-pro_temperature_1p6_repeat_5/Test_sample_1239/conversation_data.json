    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations:**\n    In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid is described by the Navier-Stokes equations for the velocity field $\\vec{u}(t, \\vec{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\vec{x})$. Setting physical constants (density $\\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$) to 1 for simplicity, the equations are:\n    *   Momentum Equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\vec{u} = - \\nabla p + \\Delta \\vec{u}$\n    *   Incompressibility Condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u} = 0$\n\n2.  **Symmetries of a PDE System:**\n    A Lie group of symmetries is a group of transformations on the independent variables $(t, x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and dependent variables $(u_1, u_2, u_3, p)$ that maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of the Lie group is the number of independent infinitesimal generators that form the basis of its Lie algebra.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Generators:**\n    We list the known point symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    *   **Time Translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit $t$ dependence), so they are invariant under time shifts $t \\to t + \\epsilon$. This gives one generator:\n        $P_0 = \\partial_t$.\n        (Dimension: 1)\n\n    *   **Space Translations:** The equations have constant coefficients and are defined on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial shifts $\\vec{x} \\to \\vec{x} + \\vec{\\epsilon}$. This gives three independent generators:\n        $P_i = \\partial_{x_i}$ for $i=1,2,3$.\n        (Dimension: 3)\n\n    *   **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are covariant with respect to rotations in space. A rotation of the coordinate system results in a corresponding rotation of the vector field $\\vec{u}$, while the scalar pressure $p$ is unchanged. The rotation group in 3D, $SO(3)$, is 3-dimensional. The generators are:\n        $J_{ij} = x_i \\partial_{x_j} - x_j \\partial_{x_i} + u_i \\partial_{u_j} - u_j \\partial_{u_i}$ for $1 \\le i < j \\le 3$.\n        (Dimension: 3)\n\n    *   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity (Galilean relativity). This transformation is $\\vec{x} \\to \\vec{x} + \\vec{c}t, \\vec{u} \\to \\vec{u} + \\vec{c}$, while $p$ and $t$ remain unchanged. This provides three more generators:\n        $G_i = t \\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1,2,3$.\n        (Dimension: 3)\n\n    *   **Scaling (Dilation):** The Navier-Stokes equations possess a scaling symmetry. If we scale time, space, velocity, and pressure according to a specific power law, the form of the equations remains unchanged. The transformation is:\n        $t \\to \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\vec{x} \\to \\lambda \\vec{x}, \\quad \\vec{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\vec{u}, \\quad p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n        This provides a single generator:\n        $D = 2t \\partial_t + x_k \\partial_{x_k} - u_k \\partial_{u_k} - 2p \\partial_p$. (sum over k)\n        (Dimension: 1)\n\n    *   **Pressure Symmetries:** The pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, if $(\\vec{u}, p)$ is a solution, so is $(\\vec{u}, p + h(t))$, where $h(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time, since $\\nabla(p + h(t)) = \\nabla p$. The infinitesimal generator for this symmetry is $h(t)\\partial_p$. Since $h(t)$ is an arbitrary function, this corresponds to an infinite number of independent generators. This means the full Lie algebra of symmetries is infinite-dimensional.\n\n4.  **Interpreting the Question:**\n    When a question asks for \"the dimension\" of a symmetry group that is known to be infinite-dimensional, it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional part, often called the \"principal\" or \"essential\" symmetry group. This is typically the group of spacetime and other physical symmetries, factoring out any \"gauge-like\" freedoms. In this case, the infinite-dimensional part corresponds to the gauge-like freedom in defining the pressure.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The finite-dimensional \"principal\" Lie algebra consists of the generators for time and space translations, rotations, Galilean boosts, and scaling. We sum the dimensions from each type of symmetry:\n    Total Dimension = 1 (Time Transl.) + 3 (Space Transl.) + 3 (Rotations) + 3 (Galilean Boosts) + 1 (Scaling) = 11.\n\nThis 11-dimensional algebra is sometimes referred to as the \"Navier-Stokes algebra\". While the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional due to the pressure term, its essential, finite-dimensional core has dimension 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
