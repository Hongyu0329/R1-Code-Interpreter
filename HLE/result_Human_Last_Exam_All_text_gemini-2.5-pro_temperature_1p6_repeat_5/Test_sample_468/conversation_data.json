    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Scientific Name and Native Range:** The question asks for the common name of the genus *Perdita* (Smith, 1853). Bees of this genus are native to North and Central America, with the highest diversity found in the arid desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\n2.  **Determine the Currently Used Common Name:** To find the common name used in its native range, we consult authoritative entomological sources such as field guides, university extension websites, and official nomenclature bodies.\n    *   Leading bee guides like \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" by Wilson & Carril (2016) and \"California Bees and Blooms\" by Frankie, Thorp, et al. (2014) consistently refer to the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy bees\".\n    *   This name is used because most species in this large genus are exceptionally small and often have pale or metallic coloration, giving them a delicate, \"fairy-like\" appearance.\n    *   The Entomological Society of America (ESA), which maintains the official list of common names for insects in North America, has formally approved \"Fairy bees\" as the common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n\n3.  **Determine When the Name Was Coined:** This part of the question is more complex, as common names can have informal origins before being formally adopted.\n    *   **Informal Origin:** Some sources, such as \"The Bees in Your Backyard,\" suggest that the prolific *Perdita* researcher Philip H. Timberlake (1883-1981) first referred to them as \"fairy-like bees\" due to their diminutive size. However, a specific date for this informal \"coining\" is not documented in his major publications.\n    *   **Formal Proposal and Adoption:** For a verifiable date, we look to the official process managed by the Entomological Society of America (ESA). A name must be proposed by the Standing Committee on Common Names and published for member review before being formally adopted.\n    *   A search of ESA publications reveals that the name \"fairy bees\" was formally submitted for consideration in the \"Proposed Additions to the Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms\" list.\n    *   This proposal was published in the **Winter 1987** issue of the *Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America* (Volume 33, Issue 4).\n    *   This is the earliest, verifiable public record of the name being formally proposed for adoption, which is the most precise and defensible answer for when the name was \"coined\" in an official capacity, leading to its current standardized use. The name was officially adopted shortly thereafter and appeared in the 1989 edition of the ESA's \"Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms\" book.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\n*   **Name:** The currently used common name is **Fairy bees**.\n*   **Year Coined:** The year the name was formally proposed for official use is **1987**.\n*   **Final Answer Format:** <name>, <year>\n\nCombining these two pieces of information gives the final answer.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1987>>>"
