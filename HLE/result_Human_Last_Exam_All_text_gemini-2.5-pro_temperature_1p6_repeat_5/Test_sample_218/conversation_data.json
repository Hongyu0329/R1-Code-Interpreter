    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationship between irreps, partitions, and dimensions.**\nThe irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. In this problem, $n=25$.\n\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in \\lambda} h_{\\lambda}(i, j)}$\nwhere the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{\\lambda}(i, j)$ is the hook length of the cell. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus 1 (for the cell itself).\n\nAn important property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by flipping the Young diagram along its main diagonal) correspond to irreps of the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. If $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate, then $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda'$ correspond to two distinct irreps with the same dimension.\n\n**Step 2: Strategize the search for low-dimension irreps.**\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the product of hook lengths is large. This generally happens for partitions that are \"long and thin\" or \"short and wide\" (which are conjugates of each other). These are partitions where one part $\\lambda_1$ is very large compared to the others. We can systematize the search by considering partitions of the form $\\lambda=(n-k, \\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is a partition of $k$, for small values of $k$.\n\nWe will systematically check partitions for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ and calculate their dimensions. For any partition we find with $d_\\lambda < 500,000$, we count it and its conjugate. We stop when the dimensions for a given $k$ become consistently larger than 500,000.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate and calculate dimensions for partitions with large first part.**\nLet $n=25$. We check partitions of the form $(25-k, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of $k$.\n\n*   **k=0:** The only partition of 0 is the empty set.\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: This is the trivial representation. $d_{(25)}=1$.\n    *   This gives one pair of irreps: $\\{(25), (1^{25})\\}$, both with dimension 1. (Count = 2)\n\n*   **k=1:** The only partition of 1 is (1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (24,1)$: $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$.\n    *   This gives one pair of irreps: $\\{(24,1), (2,1^{23})\\}$, both with dimension 24. (Count = 2 + 2 = 4)\n\n*   **k=2:** Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    *   Both give pairs of irreps with dimensions less than 500,000. Total pairs for k=2 is 2. (Count = 4 + 2*2 = 8)\n\n*   **k=3:** Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = 2,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,2,1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4,025$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,1,1,1)$: $d_{(22,1,1,1)} = 2,024$.\n    *   All 3 give pairs of irreps. Total pairs for k=3 is 3. (Count = 8 + 3*2 = 14)\n\n*   **k=4:** Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1).\n    *   $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,3,1)} = 23,751$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,2)} = 15,525$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 36,575$.\n    *   $d_{(21,1^4)} = 10,626$.\n    *   All 5 give pairs of irreps. Total pairs for k=4 is 5. (Count = 14 + 5*2 = 24)\n\n*   **k=5:** There are 7 partitions of 5. All corresponding irreps for $\\lambda=(20,\\mu)$ turn out to have dimensions less than 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n    *   $d_{(20,4,1)} = 121,800$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,2)} = 116,280$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 161,325$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 217,350$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,1^3)} = 253,575$.\n    *   $d_{(20,1^5)} = 42,504$.\n    *   All 7 give pairs of irreps. Total pairs for k=5 is 7. (Count = 24 + 7*2 = 38)\n\n*   **k=6:** There are 11 partitions of 6. We test them.\n    *   $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970$.\n    *   $d_{(19,5,1)} = 414,180$.\n    *   $d_{(19,4,2)} = 480,700$.\n    *   $d_{(19,4,1,1)} = 640,920$ (> 500,000). Further partitions in this sub-family will have larger dimensions.\n    *   $d_{(19,3,3)} = 361,725$.\n    *   $d_{(19,3,2,1)} = 735,471$ (> 500,000).\n    *   $d_{(19,1^6)} = 134,596$.\n    *   The other 6 partitions of the form $(19, \\mu)$ have dimensions greater than 500,000.\n    *   We found 5 partitions that satisfy the condition. Total pairs for k=6 is 5. (Count = 38 + 5*2 = 48)\n\n*   **k=7:** There are 15 partitions of 7.\n    *   $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600$.\n    *   $d_{(18,6,1)} = 1,515,514$ (> 500,000).\n    *   $d_{(18,1^7)} = 346,104$.\n    *   All other partitions of the form $(18, \\mu)$ have dimensions greater than 500,000.\n    *   We found 2 partitions that satisfy the condition. Total pairs for k=7 is 2. (Count = 48 + 2*2 = 52)\n\n*   **k=8:** We check the dimension for the partition expected to have the smallest dimension, $(17,8)$.\n    *   $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875$ (> 500,000).\n    *   Since the lowest dimension for $k=8$ already exceeds the limit, we can stop the search. Any partition starting with a part smaller than 17 will have an even larger dimension.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count.**\nWe need to sum the number of irreps found. Each partition we identified corresponds to a pair of irreps (the partition and its conjugate), as none of them are self-conjugate.\n\n*   k=0: 1 pair $\\implies$ 2 irreps\n*   k=1: 1 pair $\\implies$ 2 irreps\n*   k=2: 2 pairs $\\implies$ 4 irreps\n*   k=3: 3 pairs $\\implies$ 6 irreps\n*   k=4: 5 pairs $\\implies$ 10 irreps\n*   k=5: 7 pairs $\\implies$ 14 irreps\n*   k=6: 5 pairs $\\implies$ 10 irreps\n*   k=7: 2 pairs $\\implies$ 4 irreps\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 10 + 4 = 52$."
