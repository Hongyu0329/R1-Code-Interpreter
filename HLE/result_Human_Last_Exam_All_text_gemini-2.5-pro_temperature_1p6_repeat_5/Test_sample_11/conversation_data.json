    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A specific statute (law).\n    *   **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel (i.e., post-1948).\n    *   **Key Concept:** The explicit introduction of \"good faith\". In Hebrew, this legal term is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). \"Explicitly\" means the term itself must appear in the text of the law.\n    *   **Constraint:** It must be the *first* such statute.\n    *   **Formatting:** The final answer should not be preceded by \"the\" or followed by the year of its enactment.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   The most famous Israeli law concerning good faith is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 establish good faith as a fundamental, overarching principle in negotiations and contract performance.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and the Contracts (General Part) Law is often a capstone of a legislative trend, not its beginning. We must look for earlier laws.\n\n3.  **Exploring Earlier Civil Legislation:**\n    *   Before the 1973 Contracts Law, Israel passed a series of specific laws intended to gradually replace the old Ottoman and British Mandate-era legal system.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 9 of this law deals with competing transactions for the same real estate property. It gives priority to the first transaction unless the second party completed the registration while acting in \"good faith\" (*be'tom lev*). This predates the 1973 law.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law is even earlier than the Land Law. Section 6 of the Sale Law states that \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be performed...in the customary manner and in good faith.\" This is a clear, explicit use of the term and predates the Land Law by one year.\n\n4.  **Searching for Even Earlier Instances (The Critical Point):**\n    *   The analysis must go further back than the major codification projects of the late 1960s. We need to consider laws enacted closer to the state's founding.\n    *   After 1948, Israel retained many laws from the British Mandate period. The Knesset then undertook a project to review these laws, translate them into an official Hebrew version, and re-enact them as Israeli statutes. These re-enactments were called \"New Versions\" (*Nusach Hadash*). Legally, a \"New Version\" is a statute of the State of Israel.\n    *   One such law is the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance**. The original was a British Mandate law based on the English Bills of Exchange Act 1882. The Knesset issued the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]** in **1957**.\n    *   Section 28 of this 1957 ordinance defines a \"holder in due course,\" a key concept in the law of negotiable instruments. A critical condition for being a holder in due course is taking the bill of exchange \"**in good faith**\" (*be'tom lev*).\n\n5.  **Conclusion of the Analysis:**\n    *   The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] was enacted as an Israeli statute in 1957.\n    *   It explicitly uses the Hebrew term for \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n    *   Its enactment in 1957 predates the Sale Law (1968), the Land Law (1969), and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n    *   Therefore, while later laws expanded the concept of good faith into a general principle of private law, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] was the first statute of the modern State of Israel to explicitly contain the term.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question's use of \"explicitly\" is key. Laws like the Standard Contracts Law, 1964, dealt with fairness but did not use the specific term \"good faith.\"\n*   **\"Introduce\" vs. \"Originate\":** One could argue that the concept was *originated* in Israeli law by the Sale Law or Contracts Law, as they applied it as a general principle. However, the term was first *introduced* into the text of an Israeli statute via the Bills of Exchange Ordinance. The literal reading of the question favors the earliest textual appearance.\n*   **\"Statute of the modern State of Israel\":** A \"New Version\" (*Nusach Hadash*) of a Mandate-era law fully qualifies as a statute of the State of Israel, as it was re-enacted with the authority of the Knesset.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance>>>"
