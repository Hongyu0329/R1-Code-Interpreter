    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the surname of an English poet. This surname is mentioned in a specific context: within the Russian translation of an essay that describes the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Clues:**\n    *   **Setting:** Vienna, specifically its \"wide boulevards.\"\n    *   **Source:** A \"Russian translation of a certain essay.\" This points to a linguistic or cultural observation where a word's meaning or sound is reinterpreted in Russian.\n    *   **Subject:** The surname of an *English poet*.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Location:** The most famous \"wide boulevard\" in Vienna is the **Ringstrasse**, a grand circular road. Its name in German is often shortened to just the \"Ring.\"\n\n4.  **Analyze the Linguistic Connection:** The clue about the \"Russian translation\" suggests a pun or sound-alike. The crucial step is to consider how a key German word related to Vienna's boulevards would sound to a Russian speaker or be discussed in a Russian-language text. The word we've identified is \"**Ring**.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Source Essay and the Pun:** The observation is famously made by the Russian essayist and journalist **Petr Vail** in his collection of travel essays, \"Genius Loci\" (*Гений места*). In his chapter on Vienna, Vail describes the Ringstrasse. He notes that the boulevard is simply called the \"Ring.\" He then makes a direct cultural and linguistic observation that for a Russian ear, this word \"Ring\" (which in Russian can refer to a boxing or circus ring - \"ринг\") brings to mind the surname of a famous English poet.\n\n6.  **Identify the Poet:** The specific poet Vail refers to is **Browning** (either Robert Browning or Elizabeth Barrett Browning). In Russian, the name is written \"Браунинг.\" The association between the sound of \"Ring\" and the name \"Browning\" is the core of this literary observation.\n\n7.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   **Essay:** \"Genius Loci\" by Petr Vail (a Russian essay, so the \"translation\" part of the prompt refers to the translation of a foreign concept/word into a Russian context).\n    *   **Vienna Boulevard:** The Ringstrasse (\"The Ring\").\n    *   **Word:** Ring.\n    *   **Association:** The sound reminds a Russian speaker of the surname Browning.\n    *   **Poet:** Browning.\n\nThe name of the poet is Browning.\n\n<<<Browning>>>"
