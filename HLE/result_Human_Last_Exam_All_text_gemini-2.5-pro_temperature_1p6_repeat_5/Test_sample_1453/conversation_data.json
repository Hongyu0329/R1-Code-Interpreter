    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Coiled-Coil Structure and the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are coiled around each other, forming a superhelix. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, which is denoted as **(abcdefg)n**.\n\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`**: These are the most critical positions for determining the structure. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic (water-repelling) amino acids (like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Alanine (A)). These residues form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil, which is the primary driving force for oligomerization. The way these side chains pack together (\"knobs-into-holes\") dictates the number of helices in the bundle.\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`**: These positions are also on the seam between the helices but are more exposed to the solvent. They are often occupied by charged or polar amino acids (like Glutamate (E), Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Glutamine (Q)). Favorable electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between `e` and `g` positions on adjacent helices can add stability and specificity to the interaction.\n*   **Positions `b`, `c`, and `f`**: These are typically solvent-exposed and are usually occupied by hydrophilic (water-loving) amino acids.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to find the correct `(abcdefg)` frame. We do this by looking for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues at a spacing characteristic of the `a` and `d` positions (a residue at position `i` is followed by another core residue at `i+3` or `i+4`). The most stable hydrophobic core will reveal the correct frame.\n\nLet's test possible frames by identifying the `a` and `d` residues they would produce. The most chemically plausible frame is the one that places large hydrophobic residues consistently in the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's test the frame where the first Isoleucine (I) at position 3 is a `d` residue.\n\n*   Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   Position #: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101112131415161718192021222324252627282930`\n*   Heptad Pos:`b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n\nNow, let's list the residues at the core `a` and `d` positions based on this alignment:\n*   **`a` positions**:\n    *   Position 7: **L** (Leucine)\n    *   Position 14: **L** (Leucine)\n    *   Position 21: **L** (Leucine)\n    *   Position 28: **L** (Leucine)\n*   **`d` positions**:\n    *   Position 3: **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position 10: **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position 17: **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position 24: **I** (Isoleucine)\n\nThis alignment is excellent. Every `a` position is a Leucine and every `d` position is an Isoleucine. Both are bulky, hydrophobic amino acids perfect for forming a stable core. This gives us high confidence that we have identified the correct heptad repeat pattern. The consistent pattern is **`a`=L** and **`d`=I**.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Core Packing (`a`/`d` Residues) to the Oligomeric State**\n\nThe specific identity and arrangement of residues at the `a` and `d` positions strongly influence the geometry of the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which in turn determines the number of helices that can pack together most efficiently. There are well-established rules based on extensive experimental and structural studies:\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices)**: Often tolerant of various hydrophobic residues. The classic \"Leucine zipper\" has Leucine at the `d` position (`d`=L), which packs very well in a dimeric interface.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices)**: Packing is different. Isoleucine fits very well at the `a` position (`a`=I) due to its β-branched side chain. A common trimeric motif is `a`=I, `d`=L.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices)**: This state is strongly favored by the reverse pattern: Isoleucine at the `d` position and Leucine at the `a` position (`a`=L, `d`=I). The β-branched \"knob\" of Isoleucine at the `d` position is sterically awkward for dimers and trimers but fits perfectly into the \"hole\" of a four-helix bundle. This is a canonical tetramerization motif.\n*   **Higher-order oligomers**: These usually require different patterns, often involving smaller core residues (like Alanine) or specific polar interactions.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Oligomeric State**\n\nOur analysis of the sequence yielded a consistent core pattern of:\n*   `a` position = **Leucine (L)**\n*   `d` position = **Isoleucine (I)**\n\nThis `a`=L, `d`=I pattern is the classic, well-documented motif for the formation of a **tetramer** (a four-helix coiled-coil). The packing efficiency of this specific combination of \"knobs\" (L and I) and \"holes\" is maximized in a tetrameric arrangement.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n1.  Identify the correct heptad repeat by finding the most consistent hydrophobic core. The frame starting with `G=b, E=c, I=d...` yields a repeating core of `a=L, d=I`.\n2.  Consult established rules for \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n3.  The pattern `a=L, d=I` is a canonical motif that drives the formation of a 4-helix bundle.\n4.  Therefore, the protein would be a tetramer.\n\nThe oligomeric state would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
