    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about the novel *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n2.  **Identify the Key Task:** The task is to name a specific character from this novel.\n3.  **Identify the Character's Attributes/Actions:**\n    *   The character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   The character describes the religious practices or foundational myths of that city.\n    *   The description must contain elements that a reader would recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Story of Romulus and Remus:** The core elements of this myth are twin brothers who were abandoned, suckled by a she-wolf, and went on to found Rome. The most iconic image is the she-wolf suckling the two infants. Any description in the book must allude to this imagery.\n*   **The Context of the Novel:** *The House of the Wolfings* is about a tribe of Goths on the border of the Roman Empire, preparing for war. A character visiting a Roman city would be a significant event, likely part of their backstory or a past journey.\n*   **Character Knowledge:** We need to differentiate between characters who have direct, first-hand knowledge from visiting Roman lands and those who may only have second-hand information. The question implies a personal account (\"...visited... and describes...\").\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Examine Potential Characters:** The primary characters are Thiodolf (the war-leader of the Wolfings), Hall-Sun (his foster-daughter), and the Thrall-woman (a captive who is secretly of Roman descent).\n2.  **Look for Relevant Passages:** We need to search the text for a scene where a character recounts a journey to Roman lands and discusses their beliefs or symbols.\n3.  **Locate the Specific Scene:** In Chapter IV, titled \"Thiodolf telleth of the Roof of the Wolfings,\" Thiodolf is speaking to his foster-daughter, Hall-Sun. He recounts a story from his youth when he travelled south into the lands of the Roman Empire.\n4.  **Analyze the Character's Description:** During this account, Thiodolf describes the Romans' reverence for their founders. He says that in their cities, they display a specific image. His description is as follows (paraphrased from the text): He saw in every Roman city an image of a She-Wolf suckling two little children. He explains that the Romans believe a wolf was the \"mother\" of their first father and his brother.\n5.  **Connect the Description to the Myth:** This description is an unmistakable reference to the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus and the iconic statue, the Lupa Capitolina (Capitoline Wolf). Thiodolf's account of a she-wolf, two brothers, and their status as city founders directly corresponds to the myth.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The character who visited a Roman city and provided this specific description is **Thiodolf**. He recounts this personal experience to explain the nature of the Romans to Hall-Sun.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
