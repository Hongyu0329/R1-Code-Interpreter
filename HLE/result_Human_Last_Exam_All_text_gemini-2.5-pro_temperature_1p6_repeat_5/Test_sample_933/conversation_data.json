    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature from a list of options at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be synthesized efficiently. The key phrases are \"any method of synthesis,\" \"coldest temperature,\" and \"produced efficiently.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Standard Synthesis Method**\nThe most common and historically significant method for preparing XeF4 is the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gases.\n*   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n*   **Typical Conditions:** This reaction is most often performed by heating the reactants in a nickel container at approximately **400°C**. At this temperature, with a suitable molar ratio of reactants (e.g., 1 part Xe to 5 parts F2) and pressure (~6 atmospheres), the reaction proceeds at a good rate and gives a high yield of XeF4. This establishes 400°C as a temperature for efficient production.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Temperature Options Based on the Standard Method**\n*   **A. 600°C:** This temperature is generally considered too high for efficient XeF4 production. It tends to favor the formation of xenon hexafluoride (XeF6), especially with a high fluorine concentration, and can also lead to the thermal decomposition of the desired XeF4 product.\n*   **B. 400°C:** This is the classic, textbook temperature for efficient synthesis. It provides a good balance between reaction rate and product stability/selectivity.\n*   **C. 200°C:** According to chemical kinetics (like the Arrhenius equation), decreasing the temperature from 400°C to 200°C would drastically reduce the reaction rate, likely by several orders of magnitude. The process would become impractically slow and thus would not be considered \"efficient.\"\n*   **D, E, F (78°C, 0°C, -78°C):** These temperatures are far too low for the uncatalyzed thermal reaction to overcome the activation energy barrier (which involves breaking the strong F-F bond). No significant reaction would occur.\n\nBased on the standard thermal method alone, 400°C seems to be the only efficient option among those that are not too high.\n\n**Step 4: Consider \"Any Method of Synthesis\"**\nThe question allows for any synthesis route. This means we must consider alternatives to the high-temperature thermal method.\n*   **Photochemical and Electric Discharge Methods:** These methods use light or electricity to provide the activation energy, allowing reactions to occur at low ambient temperatures (even as low as -78°C). However, they often produce a mixture of products (XeF2, XeF4, XeF6) and the overall production rate (throughput) is generally low, which challenges the definition of \"efficient\" for practical synthesis.\n*   **Catalyzed Synthesis:** A crucial point is that chemical reactions can be sped up by catalysts, allowing them to proceed at lower temperatures. Research has shown that the synthesis of XeF4 can be catalyzed. A published method demonstrates that in the presence of a small amount of XeF2 acting as a catalyst, Xe and F2 react to form XeF4 with a high yield (97%) at **78°C** over a 24-hour period. A process that gives a near-quantitative yield in a reasonable timeframe is certainly considered an efficient synthesis, especially for a laboratory scale.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nWe have identified two efficient methods:\n1.  The standard thermal method at **400°C**.\n2.  A catalyzed method at **78°C**.\n\nThe question asks for the **coldest** temperature at which the synthesis is still efficient. Comparing the two viable options, 78°C is significantly colder than 400°C. The catalyzed reaction is reportedly sluggish at room temperature, making 0°C and -78°C unlikely to be efficient. Therefore, 78°C is the coldest temperature in the list where an efficient synthesis method for XeF4 is known to exist.\n\n<<<D>>>"
