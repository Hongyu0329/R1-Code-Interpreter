    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the character 謄 to determine its radical.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Kanji Character**\nFirst, we look at the structure of the character 謄. It is composed of two main parts, arranged in a left-right configuration:\n*   Left part: 言\n*   Right part: 朕 with two dots (灬) below it. This part is a phonetic component.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese, the radical (部首, bushu) is the component used to classify and index the kanji in a dictionary. For characters with a clear left-right split, the radical is very often the part on the left, especially when that part is a common radical itself.\n\n*   The left part is 言. This radical means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The right part acts as the phonetic component, indicating the character's reading (トウ).\n*   The meaning of 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is directly related to words and documents. This semantic connection strongly suggests that 言 is the radical.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nRadicals often have specific names based on their form and position within a character.\n\n*   The radical 言 is called \"iu\" or \"gen.\"\n*   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The specific name for the 言 radical when it is on the left side is \"gonben\" (言偏, ごんべん).\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name of the radical using Hepburn romanization, as requested by the prompt.\n\n*   The Japanese name is ごんべん.\n*   The Hepburn transcription is \"gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Radical vs. Phonetic Component:** It is important to distinguish between the radical (which usually provides a clue to the meaning) and the phonetic component (which usually provides a clue to the pronunciation). In 謄, 言 is the radical, and the complex right side is the phonetic component.\n*   **Radical Naming Convention:** The name of the radical can change with its position. \"Gonben\" specifically means the 言 radical when it's on the left side (\"-ben\" is a variation of \"hen\"). This is analogous to the example \"Onnahen\" for 媛, where 女 is on the left.\n*   **Correct Transcription:** Ensure the romanization is accurate. For instance, the ん in ごんべん is romanized as \"n\" before the consonant \"b\".\n\nFollowing this analysis, the radical of 謄 is 言, and its name in Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
