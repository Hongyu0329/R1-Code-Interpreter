    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Section:** Act I variation (Kitri's solo)\n*   **Specific Step:** single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific ballet step**\nA \"pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" is a very specific technical step in ballet. It begins with the dancer in fifth position (heels and toes crossed), doing a plié (bending the knees), and then pushing off to relevé (rise) onto one leg to execute an outward (en dehors) turn, with the other foot brought to the knee in a passé position. This is distinct from other types of turns like piqué turns or fouetté turns.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the choreography of Kitri's Act I variation**\nKitri's solo variation in Act I of Don Quixote is famous for its energetic and charismatic character. The choreography, originally by Marius Petipa and later revised by Alexander Gorsky, is well-established. Its key features include:\n*   Sharp, quick jumps (jetés).\n*   Difficult balances, notably holding an attitude balance on pointe.\n*   A fast diagonal traveling sequence of turns.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the turning sequence in the Act I variation**\nThe most prominent turning sequence in this specific variation is the diagonal of turns. Upon close examination of Natalia Osipova's performances (and the standard choreography), this sequence consists of **piqué turns**. A piqué turn involves the dancer stepping directly onto a straight leg on pointe, with the other leg coming to passé. It does not start from a two-footed fifth position plié for each rotation.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the performed steps to the question's specified step**\nThe turns performed by Osipova in the Act I variation are piqué turns, which are technically different from pirouettes originating from the fifth position. The variation's choreography does not include a series of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position. This type of turn is more characteristic of other famous variations, such as Princess Aurora's variation in Act I of *The Sleeping Beauty*.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the count**\nSince the choreography of the Don Quixote Act I variation as performed by Natalia Osipova in 2008 does not contain any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position, the number of such turns is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
