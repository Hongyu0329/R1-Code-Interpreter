    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and its Premises**\n\n*   **Core Theory:** We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, where for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (T).\n    2.  S believes P (B).\n    3.  S is justified in believing P (J).\n*   **Constraint 1: The Epistemic States:** Our only two available mental states regarding a proposition are 'Knowledge' or 'Belief'. Based on the JTB definition, 'Knowledge' is a belief that is justified and true. Therefore, the state of 'Belief' must represent any belief that fails to meet these criteria—i.e., a belief that is either unjustified, false, or both.\n*   **Constraint 2: Ignore Gettier Problems:** We must disregard the classic counterexamples where a person has a justified true belief by sheer luck, which intuitively does not feel like knowledge. This forces us to look for other, more fundamental problems with the JTB framework itself.\n*   **The Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that arise for the JTB definition under these specific constraints.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the First Problem - The Regress of Justification (The 'J' Condition)**\n\nThe JTB theory states that a belief must be \"justified\" to count as knowledge. However, it doesn't specify what makes a justification adequate. This opens up a critical flaw known as the **Regress Problem**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (The Problem Itself):** If you are asked to justify your belief (let's call it B1), you will likely offer another belief as your reason (B2). But then, what justifies B2? This questioning can continue, leading to three possibilities (known as the Agrippan Trilemma):\n    1.  **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justifications goes on forever, meaning no belief is ever fundamentally justified.\n    2.  **Dogmatic Assumption:** The chain of justifications ends with a belief that is simply asserted without its own justification. This means the entire structure of \"knowledge\" rests on an unproven assumption.\n    3.  **Circularity:** The justification for a belief eventually loops back to the original belief it was meant to support (e.g., \"A is true because of B, and B is true because of A\").\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Impact of the Constraints):** The strict binary of 'Knowledge' vs. 'Belief' makes this problem particularly severe. To classify a mental state as 'Knowledge', we must be able to confirm it is justified. But if the very foundation of justification is an infinite regress or a dogmatic assumption, then the distinction between a 'Justified' belief (Knowledge) and an 'Unjustified' belief (Belief) becomes fundamentally unstable and arbitrary. We can never be sure if we have met the 'J' condition.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Second Problem - The Inaccessibility of Truth (The 'T' Condition)**\n\nThe JTB theory requires that for a belief to be knowledge, the proposition must be objectively **true**. This condition is external to the believer's mind.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (The Problem Itself):** A person holding a belief cannot step outside their own consciousness to compare their belief directly with reality. The 'truth' of a proposition is not something the believer can access in a way that is separate from their beliefs and justifications about it. To check if the belief \"It is raining\" is true, you might look out the window. This gives you a new, very strong *justified belief* that it's raining, but you cannot access the \"truth\" of the matter without filtering it through your perceptions and further beliefs.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Impact of the Constraints):** This creates a first-person vs. third-person crisis. From the perspective of the person holding the belief, a perfectly justified but false belief is indistinguishable from a justified true belief (Knowledge). Since the 'T' condition is inaccessible to the subject, they can never be absolutely certain that they are in a state of 'Knowledge' rather than a state of 'justified false Belief'. The distinction between the only two available states—Knowledge and Belief—hinges on an external factor that the individual cannot infallibly verify for themselves.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nCombining these analyses, we identify two core problems with the JTB framework that are independent of Gettier cases:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Justification:** The 'J' condition is ill-defined and leads to a regress problem, making the boundary between \"justified\" Knowledge and \"unjustified\" Belief arbitrary and unstable.\n2.  **The Problem of Truth:** The 'T' condition is inaccessible from the believer's first-person perspective, making it impossible for the believer to distinguish Knowledge from a well-justified but ultimately false Belief.\n\n<<<The two problems for the JTB definition under these constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Regress of Justification:** The 'J' condition requires justification, but it does not solve the Agrippan Trilemma (infinite regress, dogmatism, or circularity). This means there is no solid foundation for justification, making the distinction between a \"justified\" state of Knowledge and an \"unjustified\" state of Belief fundamentally arbitrary and unstable.\n\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** The 'T' condition requires a proposition to be objectively true, a fact that is external to the believer's mind. A believer has no way to directly access this objective truth and can only form more beliefs about it. This makes it impossible for the believer themselves to distinguish between Knowledge (a justified true belief) and a very convincing and well-justified false Belief, as the distinguishing factor ('Truth') is not directly verifiable from their perspective.>>>"
