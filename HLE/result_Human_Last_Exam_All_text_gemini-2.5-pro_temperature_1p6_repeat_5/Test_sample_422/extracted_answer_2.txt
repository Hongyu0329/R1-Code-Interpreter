The two problems for the JTB definition under these constraints are:

1.  **The Regress of Justification:** The 'J' condition requires justification, but it does not solve the Agrippan Trilemma (infinite regress, dogmatism, or circularity). This means there is no solid foundation for justification, making the distinction between a "justified" state of Knowledge and an "unjustified" state of Belief fundamentally arbitrary and unstable.

2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** The 'T' condition requires a proposition to be objectively true, a fact that is external to the believer's mind. A believer has no way to directly access this objective truth and can only form more beliefs about it. This makes it impossible for the believer themselves to distinguish between Knowledge (a justified true belief) and a very convincing and well-justified false Belief, as the distinguishing factor ('Truth') is not directly verifiable from their perspective.
