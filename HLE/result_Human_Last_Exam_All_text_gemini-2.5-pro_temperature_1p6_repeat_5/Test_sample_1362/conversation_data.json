    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which curve has good ordinary reduction above 2.\n\n**1. Understand the terminology**\n\n*   **Curve**: The given equations are of the form `z^2 = f(x)`, which define hyperelliptic curves.\n*   **Reduction at a prime `p`**: This means we consider the coefficients of the curve's equation modulo `p`, effectively defining a curve over the finite field `F_p`. We are interested in primes `p > 2`.\n*   **Good Reduction**: A curve has good reduction at a prime `p` if the resulting curve over `F_p` is smooth (has no singular points). For a hyperelliptic curve `z^2 = f(x)` and a prime `p > 2`, this is equivalent to the condition that the polynomial `f(x)` has no repeated roots when considered modulo `p`. This, in turn, means that the discriminant of `f(x)`, denoted `disc(f)`, is not divisible by `p`.\n*   **Ordinary Reduction**: This is a property of the Jacobian of the curve. The Jacobian of a curve `C` is an abelian variety `Jac(C)`. `Jac(C)` has ordinary reduction at `p` if its `p`-torsion subgroup is as large as possible. A key distinction arises between two types of curves:\n    *   **Curves with Complex Multiplication (CM)**: These are special curves whose Jacobians have a larger ring of endomorphisms than usual. For these curves, supersingular reduction (the opposite of ordinary) occurs for a high proportion (a positive density) of primes.\n    *   **Generic (non-CM) curves**: For these curves, supersingular reduction is rare. It is conjectured (and known in many cases) that the set of supersingular primes has density zero. Thus, they have ordinary reduction for \"almost all\" primes.\n*   **\"Above 2\"**: This phrase typically means \"for all primes `p > 2`\". However, if we check for good reduction, we find that none of the given curves has good reduction for *all* primes `p > 2`. A more standard interpretation in this context is \"for all but a finite set of primes `p > 2`\". Under this interpretation, we look for a curve that has good reduction for almost all primes and is generically ordinary.\n\n**2. Step-by-step analysis of each option**\n\n**A. z^2 = x^5 + 3**\n*   **Good Reduction**: The discriminant of `f(x) = x^5 + 3` is `disc(f) = 5^5 * 3^4`. The primes of bad reduction are `p=3` and `p=5`. Since this is a finite set, it has good reduction for almost all primes.\n*   **Ordinary Reduction**: The curve is of the form `z^2 = x^n + c`. The Jacobian of such a curve typically has Complex Multiplication (CM) by `Z[ζ_n]`. In this case, CM is by `Z[ζ_5]`. A consequence of CM by `Z[ζ_5]` is that the curve has supersingular reduction for all primes `p` that do not split completely in the field `Q(ζ_5)`. This condition is `p \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 5`. This is an infinite set of primes (e.g., `p = 3, 7, 13, ...`). Therefore, the curve does not have ordinary reduction for almost all primes. **A is incorrect.**\n\n**B. z^2 = x^5 - 1**\n*   **Good Reduction**: The discriminant of `f(x) = x^5 - 1` is `disc(f) = 5^5`. The only prime of bad reduction is `p=5`. It has good reduction for almost all primes.\n*   **Ordinary Reduction**: Similar to A, this curve's Jacobian has CM by `Z[ζ_5]`. It has supersingular reduction for all primes `p \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 5`. This is an infinite set of primes. **B is incorrect.**\n\n**C. z^2 = x^6 - 1**\n*   **Good Reduction**: The discriminant of `f(x) = x^6 - 1` is `disc(f) = -2^6 \\cdot 3^6`. The only odd prime of bad reduction is `p=3`. It has good reduction for almost all odd primes.\n*   **Ordinary Reduction**: The Jacobian of this curve has CM by `Z[ζ_6]`. It has supersingular reduction for all primes `p` such that `p \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 6`. This is an infinite set of primes (e.g., `p = 5, 7, 11, ...`). **C is incorrect.**\n\n**D. z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1**\n*   **Good Reduction**: We compute the discriminant of `f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1`. The discriminant is `disc(f) = 16 \\cdot 3557 = 2^4 \\cdot 3557`. The primes of bad reduction are `p=2` and `p=3557`. This is a finite set, so the curve has good reduction for almost all primes `p > 2`.\n*   **Ordinary Reduction**: The polynomial `f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1` is \"generic\"; it doesn't have the special structure of the other polynomials that leads to CM. For such non-CM curves, it is a known (and generally conjectured) phenomenon that they have ordinary reduction for a set of primes of density 1. The set of supersingular primes is of density 0. Therefore, this curve has ordinary reduction for almost all primes. **D is the most likely candidate.**\n\n**E. z^2 = 4*x + x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^5**\n*   **Good Reduction**: Let's rewrite the polynomial: `f(x) = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x = x(4x^4 + 4x^2 + 1) = x(2x^2 + 1)^2`. Since `f(x)` has the term `(2x^2+1)^2`, it has repeated roots (specifically, the roots of `2x^2+1=0` are double roots). Therefore, the discriminant of `f(x)` is `0`. A curve with `disc(f) = 0` is singular over `Q`. Its reduction modulo any odd prime `p` will also be singular. Thus, it has bad reduction for *all* odd primes. This fails the good reduction condition. **E is incorrect.**\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing each curve, we find that:\n*   Curves A, B, and C have Complex Multiplication, which forces them to have supersingular reduction for infinitely many primes.\n*   Curve E is singular and has bad reduction at all odd primes.\n*   Curve D has good reduction for all but a single odd prime (`p=3557`) and, as a generic non-CM curve, is expected to have ordinary reduction for almost all primes.\n\nTherefore, curve D is the only one that fits the description of having \"good ordinary reduction above 2\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
