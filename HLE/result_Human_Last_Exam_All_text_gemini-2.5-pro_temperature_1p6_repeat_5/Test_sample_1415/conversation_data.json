    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined by composition:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nA crucial point to recognize is that the integrand F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is the derivative of ln|F₃(x)|.\nLet f(x) = F₃(x). The integrand is f'(x)/f(x).\nThe antiderivative of f'(x)/f(x) is ln|f(x)|.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nUsing the antiderivative, we can evaluate the definite integral:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\nUsing the property of logarithms, this can be simplified to:\nV = ln(|F₃(1) / F₃(0)|)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(x) at the limits of integration**\n\nWe need to find the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1).\n\n*   **Calculating F₃(0):**\n    F₀(0) = 0\n    F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n    F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **Calculating F₃(1):**\n    F₀(1) = 1\n    F₁(1) = sin(1)  (Note: '1' is in radians)\n    F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 5: Determine the sign of F₃(x) and substitute the values**\n\nFor the interval x in [0, 1], we know that 0 ≤ sin(x) ≤ sin(1).\nSince sin(x) ≥ 0, e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1.\nTherefore, 1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2.\nThis means F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) ≥ ln(2) for all x in [0, 1].\nSince ln(2) is positive, F₃(x) is positive on the interval [0, 1]. We can safely remove the absolute value signs.\n\nV = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )\n\n**Step 6: Numerically evaluate V**\n\nWe will use approximations for the constants and function values.\n*   sin(1 radian) ≈ 0.841471\n*   e ≈ 2.71828\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.320116\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(1 + 2.320116) = ln(3.320116) ≈ 1.200003\n*   F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147\n*   V ≈ ln(1.200003 / 0.693147) ≈ ln(1.73123) ≈ 0.54884\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final required value**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54884 = 5488.4\nThe closest integer to 5488.4 is 5488.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5488}$."
