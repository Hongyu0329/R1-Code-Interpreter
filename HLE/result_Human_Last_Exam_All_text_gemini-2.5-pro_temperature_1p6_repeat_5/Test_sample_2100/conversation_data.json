    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\n*   The clue states that Andrei Voznesensky called a man \"a joy-discovering sailor.\"\n*   This points to a specific work by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This phrase is a direct quote from his famous poem \"Avos!\", which served as the libretto for the iconic Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n*   The rock opera tells the story of a real historical figure. The main character is the one being referred to.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   Voznesensky's poem also contains the line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n*   This implies that at the time the poem was written (the 1970s), the exact location of the main character's grave was unknown or lost.\n*   This detail is crucial because it links the poetic reference to a real-world historical mystery.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third and most critical clue.**\n*   The clue states, \"The answer to this question [about the grave] emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n*   This means we are looking for a historical figure whose lost grave was rediscovered or definitively located during that specific time frame.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues to identify the man.**\n*   The main character of \"Juno and Avos\" is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764-1807).\n*   Rezanov was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer. He led an expedition on the ships Juno and Avos to Russian America and California, which fits the description of a \"sailor.\"\n*   On his return journey across Siberia, he fell ill and died in the city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807. He was buried there at the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n*   During the Soviet period, the cathedral and its cemetery were destroyed, and the precise location of Rezanov's grave was lost.\n*   Fueled by the immense popularity of the rock opera and a growing interest in history during the Perestroika era, a search for the grave was initiated. In the late 1980s, historical commissions and local enthusiasts in Krasnoyarsk successfully identified the probable site of the grave. This discovery solved the mystery posed in Voznesensky's poem.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final answer.**\n*   All the details perfectly match the life and posthumous story of Nikolai Rezanov.\n*   The question asks for this man's last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
