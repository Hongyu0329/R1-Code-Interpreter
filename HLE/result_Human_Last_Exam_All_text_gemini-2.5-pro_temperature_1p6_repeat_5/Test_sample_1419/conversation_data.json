    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n**Step 1: Setting up the Renormalization Group (RG) analysis**\n\nWe consider the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory with the Lagrangian density in $d$ Euclidean dimensions:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_0^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_0}{4!} \\phi^4 $$\nWe work near four dimensions, so we set $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter.\n\n**Careful point 1: Mass dimension of the coupling constant**\nThe action $S = \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless (in units where $\\hbar=1$).\n- From the kinetic term $\\int d^dx (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2$, the mass dimension of the field $\\phi$ is $[\\phi] = (d-2)/2$.\n- From the interaction term $\\int d^dx \\lambda_0 \\phi^4$, the mass dimension of the bare coupling $\\lambda_0$ is $[\\lambda_0] = d - 4[\\phi] = d - 4\\frac{d-2}{2} = d - 2(d-2) = 4-d = \\epsilon$.\nSo, the bare coupling $\\lambda_0$ has a small positive mass dimension.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the dimensionless coupling and the Beta function**\n\nTo analyze the flow of the coupling with the energy scale, we introduce an arbitrary renormalization mass scale $\\mu$ and define a dimensionless renormalized coupling constant, which we denote by $u$. The physical, dimensionful coupling $\\lambda_R$ is related to $u$ by:\n$$ \\lambda_R = u \\mu^\\epsilon $$\nThe beta function, $\\beta(u)$, describes how this dimensionless coupling $u$ changes with the scale $\\mu$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} $$\n\n**Step 3: Deriving the general form of the Beta function**\n\nThe beta function for the dimensionless coupling $u$ in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions is given, to one-loop order, by:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + B u^2 + O(u^3) $$\n\n**Careful point 2: The structure of the beta function**\n- The term $-\\epsilon u$ arises from the engineering (classical) scaling dimension of the coupling constant. It reflects the fact that $\\lambda_R$ has to scale as $\\mu^\\epsilon$ to keep $u$ dimensionless. Its sign is negative.\n- The term $B u^2$ arises from one-loop quantum corrections. The coefficient $B$ needs to be calculated from the loop diagrams of the theory. The sign of this term is crucial. For $\\phi^4$ theory in $d=4$, the coupling is known to increase with energy (the theory is \"trivial\"), which means this term is positive.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the one-loop coefficient B**\n\nThe coefficient $B$ is determined by calculating the one-loop correction to the four-point vertex function. For the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$, the vertex factor is $-i\\lambda$.\nThe one-loop correction comes from three distinct Feynman diagrams (s, t, and u channels). Each diagram contributes an equal amount to the UV divergence.\n\nThe contribution of one such diagram (say, the s-channel) to the effective vertex is:\n$$ \\delta(-i\\lambda)_{1-loop, s} = \\frac{1}{2}(-i\\lambda)^2 \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{i}{k^2} \\frac{i}{(k-p)^2} $$\n**Careful point 3: Symmetry factors and number of diagrams**\n- The factor of $1/2$ is a symmetry factor for the loop.\n- There are 3 such diagrams, so the total one-loop correction to the vertex involves multiplying this by 3.\n\nThe loop integral is UV divergent. Using dimensional regularization in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions, the divergent part of the integral can be calculated. The key result, however, can be obtained more simply by considering the running of the coupling in $d=4$. The one-loop beta function in exactly $d=4$ ($\\epsilon=0$) is given by:\n$$ \\beta(\\lambda)|_{d=4} = \\frac{3\\lambda^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the dimensionless coupling in $d=4$. This result is standard and comes from a careful evaluation of the loop integral coefficient. The factor of 3 comes from the three diagrams. The factor of $1/(16\\pi^2)$ is characteristic of one-loop integrals in four dimensions.\n\nThis calculation gives the coefficient $B$ for our beta function in $d=4-\\epsilon$.\n$$ B = \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} $$\nSo, the beta function for our dimensionless coupling $u$ is:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\n\n**Step 5: Finding the fixed point**\n\nA fixed point of the RG flow, $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero:\n$$ \\beta(u^*) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expression for the beta function:\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  $u^* = 0$: This is the **Gaussian fixed point**, corresponding to a non-interacting theory.\n2.  $-\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0$: This gives the non-trivial fixed point.\n\nSolving for the non-trivial fixed point $u^*$:\n$$ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon $$\n$$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3} $$\n\nThis is the celebrated **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**.\n\n**Careful point 4: Physical significance**\n- The existence of this non-trivial fixed point for $\\epsilon > 0$ (i.e., in dimensions $d<4$) is what makes the $\\epsilon$-expansion a powerful tool for studying critical phenomena.\n- The fixed point coupling $u^*$ is small when $\\epsilon$ is small, which justifies the one-loop approximation.\n- The sign of the beta function determines the stability of the fixed points. For $0 < u < u^*$, $\\beta(u) < 0$, so the coupling flows towards the Gaussian fixed point ($u=0$) in the infrared (low energy). For $u > u^*$, $\\beta(u) > 0$, so the coupling flows away from $u^*$. This means the Wilson-Fisher fixed point is an ultraviolet (UV) fixed point.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$ is found by setting the one-loop beta function $\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$ to zero and solving for the non-trivial root.\n\nFinal expression: $u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}{3}$.\n\n<<<16*pi^2*epsilon/3>>>"
