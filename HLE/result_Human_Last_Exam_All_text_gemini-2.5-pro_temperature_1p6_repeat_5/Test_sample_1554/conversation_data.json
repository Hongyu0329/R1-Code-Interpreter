    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belonging to the Lviv-Warsaw School. This was a prominent school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1918-1939). Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **Key Concept:** The notion of \"hallmark.\" This is a general term for a sign, mark, or criterion that indicates something.\n    *   **Specific Distinction:** This \"hallmark\" is decomposed into two specific types: \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\" The task is to identify which philosopher made this particular distinction.\n\n2.  **Examine the Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   We need to consider the main contributions of the school's prominent members to see whose work aligns with this topic.\n    *   The school was heavily focused on logic, semantics (the study of meaning), and epistemology (the study of knowledge). The analysis of signs, language, and inference was a central theme.\n    *   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is a particularly strong candidate. His work spans logic, philosophy of language, and epistemology. He was deeply interested in the structure of language, the nature of meaning, and how we draw inferences. This aligns perfectly with an analysis of signs like hallmarks, symptoms, and signals.\n\n3.  **Investigate Ajdukiewicz's Contribution:**\n    *   In his works, notably in books like *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz analyzes the concept of a \"mark\" or \"hallmark\" (in Polish, *oznaka*). An *oznaka* is something whose perception leads us to infer the existence of something else.\n    *   He introduces a crucial distinction within this concept, breaking it down into two categories based on the nature of the relationship between the mark and what it signifies.\n\n4.  **Define the Categories: Symptoms and Signals:**\n    *   **Symptom:** Ajdukiewicz defines a symptom (also translated as an \"index\") as a mark that has a **natural or causal connection** to the thing it indicates. The relationship exists independently of human convention.\n        *   *Careful Point:* The classic example is smoke being a symptom of fire. There is a direct causal link between fire and the production of smoke. Seeing the smoke (the symptom) allows one to infer the existence of the fire (the cause). Another example is a fever being a symptom of an illness.\n    *   **Signal:** Ajdukiewicz defines a signal as a mark that has a **conventional connection** to what it indicates. The relationship is established by human agreement, rule, or custom. There is no inherent causal link.\n        *   *Careful Point:* The classic example is a green traffic light being a signal to proceed. The color green does not naturally or causally mean \"go\"; it means \"go\" because we have all agreed to that rule. Another example is a national flag being a signal or symbol of a particular country.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of the Analysis:**\n    *   The philosopher who explicitly decomposed the general notion of a hallmark (*oznaka*) into the sub-categories of symptom (natural/causal sign) and signal (conventional sign) is indeed **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**. This distinction is a well-known part of his contribution to logic and semiotics within the framework of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
