    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key criteria.**\nThe film in question must meet four specific conditions:\n1.  It must be a **Hollywood feature film**.\n2.  It must be **produced by a major film studio**.\n3.  The scene must feature a **teenager**.\n4.  The specific action is the teenager **riding a pink bike** and **pedaling directly toward an oncoming car**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each criterion and identify potential candidates.**\n\n*   **The Action:** \"Pedaling directly toward an oncoming car\" is a very specific and dramatic action, suggesting a confrontation, an act of desperation, or a game of chicken.\n*   **The Object:** A \"pink bike\" is a very distinct visual cue.\n*   **The Character:** A \"teenager\" places the film within the teen, coming-of-age, drama, or horror genres.\n*   **The Producer:** A \"major film studio\" (like Disney, Universal, Paramount, Warner Bros., Sony/Columbia, or their major subsidiaries like Fox Searchlight/Searchlight Pictures) is a crucial filter.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate potential candidate films against the criteria.**\n\n*   **Napoleon Dynamite (2004):**\n    *   **Major Studio:** Yes, produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a major studio's specialty division.\n    *   **Teenager:** Yes, the main characters are teenagers.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** This is a weak point. The character Deb rides a bike, but it is a light purple/lavender color, not definitively pink.\n    *   **Action:** This is the critical failure. No scene in the film depicts any character pedaling toward an oncoming car. Deb is introduced riding her bike along the road before a van pulls over. The scene is not confrontational.\n\n*   **Now and Then (1995):**\n    *   **Major Studio:** Yes, produced by New Line Cinema (a subsidiary of Warner Bros.).\n    *   **Pink Bike:** Yes, the character Teeny has a pink/purple bicycle.\n    *   **Teenager:** This is a weak point. The main characters are 12 years old in the story's primary timeline, which is pre-teen.\n    *   **Action:** This fails. The girls are chased *by* a car but do not pedal *toward* it.\n\n*   **A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985):**\n    *   **Major Studio:** Yes, New Line Cinema.\n    *   **Teenager:** Yes, the protagonist Jesse is a teenager.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** Yes, Jesse's younger sister owns a prominent pink bike.\n    *   **Action:** This fails. The described scene does not occur in the film. The teenager (Jesse) is never shown riding the pink bike at all, let alone toward a car.\n\n*   **Donnie Darko (2001):**\n    *   **Teenager:** Yes, the character Gretchen Ross is a teenager.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** Yes, Gretchen rides a distinct pink/magenta bike.\n    *   **Action:** The scene is very close but not an exact match. In the film's climax, Gretchen falls from her bike and is lying in the road when she is struck and killed by an oncoming car that swerves to avoid another person. She does not \"pedal directly toward\" it, but the core elements of a teenager, a pink bike, and an oncoming car are all present in this single, pivotal scene.\n    *   **Major Studio:** This is a critical failure. The film was produced by independent companies (Flower Films, Pandora Cinema) and distributed by Newmarket Films, not a major studio.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the analysis and determine the most likely answer.**\nNo film perfectly matches every single criterion in the question. However, the question likely refers to a famous, memorable scene that a viewer might slightly misremember.\n\n*   The scene in **Napoleon Dynamite** fails completely on the central action, making it an unlikely answer.\n*   The scene in **Donnie Darko** contains the key visual elements (teenager, pink bike, oncoming car) in a highly dramatic and memorable climax. The inaccuracies relate to the precise motion (\"pedaling toward\") and a behind-the-scenes production detail (the studio's status). It is highly plausible that a viewer would remember this dramatic scene and slightly misstate these details.\n\nGiven that the visual components of the scene in *Donnie Darko* are the strongest match, it is the most probable answer to the query, assuming a slight inaccuracy in the question's phrasing regarding the production and the exact action.\n\n<<<Donnie Darko>>>"
