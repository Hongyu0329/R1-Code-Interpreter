    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule\nFirst, we need to identify the number and type of atoms in the molecule.\n- **Molecule:** Toluene\n- **Chemical Formula:** C₇H₈\n- **Atom Count:**\n    - 7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    - 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n### Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation\nThe 6-31G notation is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. We need to break down what it means for each type of atom. The notation `k-ijG` describes how basis functions are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). The result of this construction is a set of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which is what the question asks for.\n\n- **The hyphen (-):** Separates the description of core orbitals from valence orbitals.\n- **The number before the hyphen (6):** Describes the core orbitals. A single contracted Gaussian function (CGF) is used to describe each core orbital, and it is constructed from a sum of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n- **The numbers after the hyphen (31):** Describe the valence orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of basis functions to provide more flexibility.\n    - **'3':** The \"inner\" valence orbitals are each described by a single CGF constructed from 3 PGFs.\n    - **'1':** The \"outer\" valence orbitals are each described by a single CGF constructed from 1 PGF (meaning it's an uncontracted primitive function).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Contracted Functions for Each Atom Type\n\n**A. For a single Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n- Hydrogen has only a 1s valence orbital and no core electrons. Therefore, only the `31G` part of the notation applies.\n- The 1s valence orbital is split into two functions:\n    1.  An \"inner\" function described by one CGF (from 3 PGFs).\n    2.  An \"outer\" function described by one CGF (from 1 PGF).\n- **Total CGFs for one H atom = 1 + 1 = 2**\n\n**B. For a single Carbon (C) atom:**\n- Carbon is a second-row element with a 1s core orbital and 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n- **Core (1s orbital):** The `6` in `6-31G` applies here. The 1s core orbital is represented by **1 CGF**.\n- **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The `31G` part applies here. The valence shell is split into an inner and an outer part. For each part, we need one function for the 2s orbital and one function for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    - **Inner Valence (`3`):**\n        - 1 CGF for the 2s orbital.\n        - 3 CGFs for the 2p orbitals (one for each of 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        - Total for inner valence = 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n    - **Outer Valence (`1`):**\n        - 1 CGF for the 2s orbital.\n        - 3 CGFs for the 2p orbitals.\n        - Total for outer valence = 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n- **Total CGFs for one C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Functions for Toluene (C₇H₈)\n\nNow, we sum the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n- **Total from Carbon atoms:** 7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n- **Total from Hydrogen atoms:** 8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n- **Grand Total for Toluene:** 63 + 16 = 79 CGFs\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n- **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for the number of *contracted* functions (CGFs), not the total number of primitive functions (PGFs).\n- **Core vs. Valence:** Correctly identifying which part of the basis set notation applies to which electron shells (e.g., hydrogen has no core electrons).\n- **s and p Orbitals:** Remembering that for second-row elements, the valence shell includes both s and p orbitals (one s-type function and three p-type functions per shell description).\n- **Atom Count:** Accurately counting the atoms from the chemical formula.\n\n<<<79>>>"
