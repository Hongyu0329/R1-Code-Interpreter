    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Domain and Hypothesis Class:**\n    *   We have a domain $X$ with a finite size $|X| = T$.\n    *   The hypothesis class is $H_{z-ones} = \\{h: X \\to \\{0,1\\} : |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$. In simple terms, this is the set of all possible binary classifiers on the domain $X$ that label **exactly** $z$ points as 1 (and consequently, exactly $T-z$ points as 0). The parameter $z$ is a fixed positive integer. For the class to be non-empty, we must have $1 \\le z \\le T$.\n\n2.  **VC Dimension:**\n    *   The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a hypothesis class $H$ is the size of the largest set of points that $H$ can **shatter**.\n\n3.  **Shattering:**\n    *   A hypothesis class $H$ shatters a set of points $S = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_d\\} \\subseteq X$ if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that produces that exact labeling.\n    *   Since there are $d$ points in $S$, there are $2^d$ possible binary labelings (e.g., (0,0,...,0), (0,0,...,1), ..., (1,1,...,1)).\n    *   To shatter $S$, $H$ must be able to realize all $2^d$ of these labelings on $S$.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy for Finding the VC Dimension\n\nTo find the VC dimension, we need to perform a two-part proof:\n1.  **Lower Bound:** Find the largest integer $d$ for which we can find a set of size $d$ that is shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. This proves that VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\ge d$.\n2.  **Upper Bound:** Prove that **no** set of size $d+1$ can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. This proves that VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le d$.\n\nCombining these two parts will give us the exact VC dimension.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis for the Upper Bound\n\nLet's try to find a set size that *cannot* be shattered. Let $S$ be any subset of $X$ with size $|S| = d$.\n\nThe core constraint of any hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ is that it must assign exactly $z$ ones in total over the entire domain $X$.\n\nConsider two specific labelings for the set $S$:\n1.  **The \"all ones\" labeling:** $(1, 1, \\ldots, 1)$. To realize this labeling, a hypothesis $h$ must set $h(x)=1$ for all $x \\in S$. This already uses $d$ ones. The remaining $z-d$ ones must be assigned to points in $X \\setminus S$. This is only possible if $z-d \\ge 0$, which means $d \\le z$. If $d > z$, it's impossible to label all $d$ points in $S$ as 1 because we only have $z$ ones to use in total. Therefore, if we pick any set $S$ of size $d > z$, it cannot be shattered. This gives us an upper bound: **VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le z$**.\n\n2.  **The \"all zeros\" labeling:** $(0, 0, \\ldots, 0)$. To realize this labeling, a hypothesis $h$ must set $h(x)=0$ for all $x \\in S$. This means all $z$ ones must be placed in the complement set $X \\setminus S$. The number of available points in $X \\setminus S$ is $|X \\setminus S| = T-d$. So, we must have enough space to place the $z$ ones, which means $z \\le T-d$. Rearranging this gives $d \\le T-z$. If $d > T-z$, it's impossible to label all points in $S$ as 0, because there are not enough points outside of $S$ to place all $z$ ones. Therefore, if we pick any set $S$ of size $d > T-z$, it cannot be shattered. This gives us another upper bound: **VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le T-z$**.\n\nSince *any* set of size $d$ cannot be shattered if *either* $d > z$ or $d > T-z$, the VC dimension must be less than or equal to both $z$ and $T-z$.\nThis means:\n**VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le \\min(z, T-z)$**\n\n### Step 4: Analysis for the Lower Bound\n\nNow, we need to show that we can shatter a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$. Let's pick an arbitrary subset $S \\subseteq X$ of size $|S|=d = \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nWe must show that for any desired labeling of $S$, we can find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that produces it.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary labeling for $S$ which has $k$ ones and $d-k$ zeros, for any $k$ from $0$ to $d$. To construct a valid hypothesis $h$ for this labeling, we must:\n1.  Assign 1 to the $k$ points in $S$ we want to be 1.\n2.  Assign 0 to the other $d-k$ points in $S$.\n3.  Assign the remaining $z-k$ ones to the points in the complement set $X \\setminus S$. The remaining points in $X \\setminus S$ will be assigned 0.\n\nFor this construction to be possible, we need to be able to place $z-k$ ones in the $T-d$ available slots of $X \\setminus S$. This requires two conditions to hold for all possible values of $k$ (where $0 \\le k \\le d$):\n*   **Condition 1 (Non-negative ones):** We need to place a non-negative number of ones. $z-k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$.\n*   **Condition 2 (Sufficient space):** We need to have enough space in $X \\setminus S$ for these ones. $z-k \\le |X \\setminus S| = T-d$.\n\nLet's check if these conditions hold, given our choice of $d = \\min(z, T-z)$.\n*   **Check Condition 1:** We need $k \\le z$. Since $k$'s maximum value is $d$, we need to check if $d \\le z$. By our definition, $d = \\min(z, T-z)$, which implies $d \\le z$. So this condition holds for all $k \\in [0, d]$.\n*   **Check Condition 2:** We need $z-k \\le T-d$. This is equivalent to $d+z-T \\le k$. Since $k$'s minimum value is 0, we need to check if $d+z-T \\le 0$, or $d \\le T-z$. By our definition, $d = \\min(z, T-z)$, which implies $d \\le T-z$. So this condition also holds for all $k \\in [0, d]$.\n\nSince both conditions are met for any $k \\in [0, d]$, we can successfully construct a valid hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ for any of the $2^d$ possible labelings of the set $S$.\nTherefore, any set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. This gives us the lower bound:\n**VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\ge \\min(z, T-z)$**\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom our analysis:\n*   Upper Bound: VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n*   Lower Bound: VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\ge \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nCombining these proves that the VC dimension is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Constraint is Global:** The key is that the constraint $|h^{-1}(1)|=z$ applies to the entire domain $X$, not just the subset $S$ being shattered. This global constraint is what limits the class's complexity.\n2.  **Symmetry:** Notice the problem's symmetry. A class that requires exactly $z$ ones is equivalent (in terms of VC dimension) to a class that requires exactly $z$ zeros (which means $T-z$ ones). This is why the answer involves both $z$ and $T-z$.\n3.  **Non-empty Class:** The analysis assumes the hypothesis class is non-empty, which requires $1 \\le z \\le T$. If $z > T$, the class is empty, and its VC dimension would be 0 or -1 by convention.\n4.  **Proof Structure:** The two-part proof (finding a lower bound and an upper bound) is the standard and most rigorous way to determine VC dimension.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
