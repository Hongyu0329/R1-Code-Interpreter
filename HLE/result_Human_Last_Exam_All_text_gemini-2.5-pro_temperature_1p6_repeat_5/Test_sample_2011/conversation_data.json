    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are considering a graph `G` with a set `V` of 128 vertices and a set `E` of edges connecting pairs of vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` has `S` as its vertex set and contains an edge between two vertices `u, v ∈ S` if and only if the edge `(u, v)` exists in the original graph `G`.\n*   **Induced Clique:** An induced subgraph `G[S]` is an induced clique of size `k` if `|S|=k` and `G[S]` is isomorphic to `K_k`. This is equivalent to saying that the set of vertices `S` forms a clique in `G`.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the maximum possible number of different values of `k` (clique sizes) for which a single graph `G` on 128 vertices can have an induced clique of size `k`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between different clique sizes in a single graph**\n\nLet's say a graph `G` has an induced clique of a certain size, say `K`. Does this imply anything about the existence of other induced cliques?\n\n1.  Let `K` be the size of the largest induced clique in `G`. This is known as the **clique number** of `G`, denoted as `ω(G)`.\n2.  By the definition of `ω(G) = K`, there must exist a set of `K` vertices, let's call it `S_K`, such that the subgraph induced by `S_K`, which is `G[S_K]`, is a complete graph `K_K`.\n3.  Now, let's consider any integer `j` such that `1 ≤ j < K`. Can we find an induced clique of size `j` in `G`?\n4.  Yes, we can. We can take our set `S_K` (the vertices of the `K_K` clique) and choose any subset of it with size `j`. Let's call this subset `S_j`.\n5.  Since every vertex in `S_K` is connected to every other vertex in `S_K`, it follows that every vertex in the subset `S_j` is also connected to every other vertex in `S_j`.\n6.  Therefore, the subgraph induced by `S_j`, `G[S_j]`, is a complete graph `K_j`.\n7.  This means that if a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `K`, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes `1, 2, 3, ..., K-1`.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the set of possible clique sizes**\n\nFrom the analysis in Step 2, we can conclude that for any given graph `G`, the set of all possible induced clique sizes is not arbitrary. If the maximum induced clique size is `K = ω(G)`, then the set of all induced clique sizes is precisely `{1, 2, 3, ..., K}`.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes that can appear in `G` is therefore equal to the size of this set, which is `K`, the clique number of `G`.\n\n**Step 4: Reformulate the problem**\n\nThe original question \"determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\" is now equivalent to a simpler question: \"what is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices?\"\n\n**Step 5: Solve the reformulated problem**\n\n1.  The clique number `ω(G)` represents the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n2.  A clique is a subset of the vertices. Therefore, the size of a clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph.\n3.  For a graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices, the clique number must satisfy `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n4.  Is it possible to achieve this maximum value? Yes. Consider the **complete graph** `K_{128}`. This is the graph on 128 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n5.  In `K_{128}`, the set of all 128 vertices forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number for this graph is `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n*   This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`.\n*   For the graph `G = K_{128}`, the clique number is `ω(G) = 128`.\n*   Based on our analysis in Step 3, this means that the set of all induced clique sizes in `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n*   The number of different sizes in this set is 128.\n*   Since we've established that the maximum possible clique number is 128, no graph can have more than 128 different clique sizes.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
