    "An analysis of the question is provided below, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Mathematical Terms**\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) $(J, \\le)$ in which any two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$ have a least upper bound, also called a supremum or join, denoted $j_1 \\vee j_2$.\n    *   We can view any poset as a small category. The objects of the category are the elements of the poset. A unique morphism exists from $j_1$ to $j_2$ if and only if $j_1 \\le j_2$.\n    *   In this categorical view, the upper semilattice property means that for any two objects $j_1, j_2$, their coproduct exists and is given by the object $j_1 \\vee j_2$. By induction, any finite set of objects has a coproduct.\n\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a representation of the poset $J$ in the category of vector spaces over a field $K$, denoted $\\text{Vect}_K$.\n    *   It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$.\n    *   It assigns a $K$-linear map $f(j_1 \\le j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$.\n    *   This assignment must be functorial, meaning it respects identity morphisms ($f(j \\le j) = \\text{id}_{f(j)}$) and composition ($f(j_1 \\le j_3) = f(j_2 \\le j_3) \\circ f(j_1 \\le j_2)$ for $j_1 \\le j_2 \\le j_3$).\n\n*   **Tame Functor:** A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is called tame if for any pair of elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, the canonical map induced by the coproduct diagram in $J$ is an epimorphism (i.e., surjective).\n    *   In $J$, we have morphisms $j_1 \\to j_1 \\vee j_2$ and $j_2 \\to j_1 \\vee j_2$. Applying the functor $f$ gives linear maps $f(j_1) \\to f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$ and $f(j_2) \\to f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$.\n    *   The universal property of the coproduct in $\\text{Vect}_K$ (which is the direct sum $\\oplus$) combines these two maps into a single canonical map: $\\theta_{j_1, j_2}: f(j_1) \\oplus f(j_2) \\to f(j_1 \\vee j_2)$.\n    *   The tameness condition is precisely that this map $\\theta_{j_1, j_2}$ is surjective for all $j_1, j_2 \\in J$.\n\n*   **$n$-resolvable Functor:** A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if its functor homology groups vanish in degrees higher than $n$. That is, $H_k(J, f) = 0$ for all $k > n$.\n    *   The homology groups $H_k(J, f)$ are the homology groups of a chain complex $C_*(J, f)$ constructed from the poset $J$ and the functor $f$. The $k$-th chain group is $C_k(J, f) = \\bigoplus_{j_0 < j_1 < \\dots < j_k} f(j_0)$, and the differential is defined using the structure maps of the functor $f$.\n    *   The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ such that *every* tame functor on *any* upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable.\n\n**2. Connecting the Concepts to Find the Solution**\n\nThe problem asks for the homological dimension of the class of tame functors on upper semilattices. This is a known topic in the field of functor homology.\n\n*   The structure of an upper semilattice (a category with finite coproducts) and the tameness condition (functor maps coproducts to epimorphisms) impose strong constraints on the homology of the functor.\n*   A key result in functor homology (due to Pirashvili, Loday, and others) addresses this situation directly. The theorem states:\n    > Let $J$ be a join-semilattice (i.e., an upper semilattice) and let $f: J \\to \\mathcal{A}$ be a tame functor, where $\\mathcal{A}$ is an abelian category (like $\\text{Vect}_K$). Then the homology groups of $J$ with coefficients in $f$ vanish for high degrees. Specifically, $H_k(J, f) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\n\n**3. Interpreting the Result**\n\n*   The theorem tells us that for any tame functor $f$ on an upper semilattice $J$, its homology groups $H_2(J,f), H_3(J,f), \\dots$ are all zero.\n*   This can be written as $H_k(J, f) = 0$ for all $k > 1$.\n*   Comparing this with the definition of an $n$-resolvable functor ($H_k(J,f)=0$ for $k>n$), we can see that setting $n=1$ satisfies the condition.\n*   Therefore, any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n**4. Ensuring the Bound is Sharp**\n\nThe question asks for \"what $n$\". This is typically interpreted as asking for the best possible (i.e., smallest) integer $n$ that works for all cases. We have established that $n=1$ works. Could $n=0$ also work?\n\n*   If $f$ were 0-resolvable, it would mean that $H_k(J,f) = 0$ for all $k > 0$. This would require $H_1(J,f) = 0$ in addition to the higher homology groups being zero.\n*   However, the theorem only guarantees vanishing for $k \\ge 2$. It does not state that $H_1(J,f)$ must be zero.\n*   In fact, the literature provides examples of upper semilattices $J$ and tame functors $f$ for which $H_1(J,f) \\ne 0$.\n*   Since there exists at least one such functor that is not 0-resolvable, we cannot claim that all tame functors are 0-resolvable.\n*   Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which all tame functors on upper semilattices are $n$-resolvable is $n=1$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ where $J$ is an upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable if its homology groups $H_k(J, f)$ vanish for all $k>n$. Based on a standard theorem in functor homology, for such functors, $H_k(J,f)=0$ for all $k \\ge 2$. This implies that the condition for being $n$-resolvable is met for $n=1$. This bound is sharp, as there are known examples where $H_1(J,f)$ is non-zero.\n\n<<<1>>>"
