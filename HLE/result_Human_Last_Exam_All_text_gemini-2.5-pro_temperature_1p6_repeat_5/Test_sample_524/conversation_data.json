    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the terms in the question\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. In the context of planar continua, this means a closed, bounded, and connected subset of the Euclidean plane (ℝ²).\n*   **Planar:** This means the continuum can be embedded in the plane ℝ². This is a significant restriction.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) f from X to itself such that f(x) = y. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" at every point; there are no special or distinguishable points.\n*   **Homeomorphism Classes:** We are not counting every single such object, but rather grouping them by topological equivalence. Two spaces are in the same homeomorphism class if one can be continuously deformed into the other. We want to find the total number of these distinct topological types.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the degenerate case\n\nThe simplest possible continuum is a single point.\n*   **Is a point a continuum?** Yes, it is non-empty, compact, and connected.\n*   **Is it planar?** Yes, it's a subset of ℝ².\n*   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes, trivially. For any two points x and y, they must be the same point, so the identity map f(x) = x satisfies the condition.\nTherefore, the **point** constitutes one homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the non-degenerate cases using classification theorems\n\nFor non-degenerate continua (those with more than one point), this is a classic and deep problem in topology. The complete classification was achieved through the work of several mathematicians, notably R. H. Bing, F. B. Jones, and J. T. Rogers, Jr.\n\nThe key theorem (due to Rogers, synthesizing earlier work) states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of three specific types. To distinguish them, we can use topological properties like local connectedness and whether they separate the plane.\n\n1.  **The Simple Closed Curve (homeomorphic to a circle, S¹):**\n    *   **Is it a planar continuum?** Yes, a circle is a closed, bounded, connected subset of the plane.\n    *   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes, any point on a circle can be rotated to any other point. This rotation is a homeomorphism of the circle to itself.\n    *   **Key properties:** It separates the plane into two connected components (an inside and an outside). It is also locally connected at every point. This forms our second homeomorphism class.\n\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   The pseudo-arc is a famously complex object, often described as snake-like. It is arc-like but hereditarily indecomposable (meaning it cannot be broken into two proper subcontinua, and neither can any of its subcontinua).\n    *   **Is it a planar continuum?** Yes, it can be constructed in the plane.\n    *   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes, this is a celebrated result by Bing.\n    *   **Key properties:** It does *not* separate the plane. It is *not* locally connected at any point. Its unique properties make it topologically distinct from a circle. This forms our third homeomorphism class.\n\n3.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   This object is constructed by replacing each point of a simple closed curve with a pseudo-arc in a continuous fashion. It has been proven that, up to homeomorphism, there is only one way to do this.\n    *   **Is it a planar continuum?** Yes.\n    *   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes.\n    *   **Key properties:** Like a circle, it *does* separate the plane. However, like the pseudo-arc, it is *not* locally connected. This combination of properties makes it distinct from both the circle and the pseudo-arc. This forms our fourth homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nWe have identified four distinct types of objects that fit the description. Let's summarize to confirm they are all in different homeomorphism classes:\n\n*   **Class 1: Point:** Degenerate (0-dimensional).\n*   **Class 2: Simple Closed Curve:** Non-degenerate, separates the plane, is locally connected.\n*   **Class 3: Pseudo-arc:** Non-degenerate, does *not* separate the plane, is *not* locally connected.\n*   **Class 4: Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** Non-degenerate, separates the plane, is *not* locally connected.\n\nThese four sets of properties are mutually exclusive, so the four classes are distinct. The completeness of this classification is a cornerstone result in the theory of continua. Therefore, there are exactly four such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
