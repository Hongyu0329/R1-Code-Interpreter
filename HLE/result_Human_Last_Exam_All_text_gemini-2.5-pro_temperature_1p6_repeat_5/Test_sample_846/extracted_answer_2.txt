To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape. At sunrise, when exposed to sunlight (specifically UV light), it must switch from its stable, elongated *trans*-isomer shape to its bent *cis*-isomer shape. After sunset, in the dark, it must thermally relax back, changing from the *cis* shape to the more stable *trans* shape.
