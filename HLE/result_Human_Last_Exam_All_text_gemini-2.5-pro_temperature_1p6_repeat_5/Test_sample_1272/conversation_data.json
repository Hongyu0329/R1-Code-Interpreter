    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Historical Context and Key Figures**\nThe question asks about the location of a \"first major defeat\" for the Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) in Vietnam. We need to examine his military campaigns in the region. Mu Sheng was involved in two significant Ming campaigns in Vietnam:\n1.  The initial invasion and conquest of the Hồ Dynasty (Ming–Hồ War, 1406–1407).\n2.  The campaign to suppress the Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi (1418–1427).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mu Sheng's Campaigns to Find the Defeat**\nThe first campaign (1406–1407) was a decisive victory for the Ming forces, resulting in the annexation of Vietnam as Jiaozhi Province. Therefore, it is highly unlikely Mu Sheng suffered a \"major defeat\" during this period.\n\nThe second campaign, against the Lam Sơn Uprising, is where the Ming forces faced significant resistance and eventual defeat. The climax of this war occurred in 1426-1427. The main Ming army in Jiaozhi, under General Wang Tong, was besieged in Dongguan (modern-day Hanoi). The Ming Emperor sent two large relief armies to rescue him.\n\n*   One army, led by General Liu Sheng, advanced from Guangxi province.\n*   The other army, led by General Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan province down the Red River valley.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Battle of Mu Sheng's Defeat**\nThe Vietnamese forces, under the command of Lê Lợi, decided to focus on destroying Liu Sheng's army first. In October 1427, they famously ambushed and annihilated Liu Sheng's army at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang.\n\nUpon hearing the news of Liu Sheng's complete destruction, Mu Sheng, who was still advancing, lost his will to fight. He immediately ordered a hasty retreat back to Yunnan. This is the critical moment where his own defeat occurred.\n\nVietnamese generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả were tasked with pursuing Mu Sheng's retreating army. They caught up with his forces and launched a series of attacks.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Geographic Location of the Battle**\nThe pursuit and key engagements against Mu Sheng's army took place at **Lãnh Câu** and **Đan Xá**. At these locations, Mu Sheng's army was thrown into chaos and routed, suffering heavy casualties. Mu Sheng himself managed to escape with a small contingent. This panicked retreat and the subsequent rout at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá constitute his first and most significant personal defeat in Vietnam.\n\n**Step 5: Map the Historical Location to a Modern Vietnamese Province**\nThe final step is to determine the modern location of the battlefields of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá.\n*   Historical geography places **Lãnh Câu** in the area of modern-day Hạ Hòa District.\n*   **Đan Xá** is located in the area of modern-day Thanh Ba District.\n\nBoth Hạ Hòa and Thanh Ba are districts within the present-day **Phú Thọ Province** in Vietnam.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   It is important not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng, which occurred at Chi Lăng Pass in Lạng Sơn Province.\n*   The term \"first major defeat\" is contextual. While he may have had minor setbacks, the rout of his entire relief army in 1427 was his defining major defeat in the Vietnam campaign.\n*   The defeat occurred during his retreat, prompted by news of another army's failure, but it was a military engagement where his own forces were attacked and shattered.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy tracing the events of the 1427 campaign, we can conclude that the battles at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá were the site of Mu Sheng's major defeat. These historical locations correspond to districts within the modern province of Phú Thọ.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
