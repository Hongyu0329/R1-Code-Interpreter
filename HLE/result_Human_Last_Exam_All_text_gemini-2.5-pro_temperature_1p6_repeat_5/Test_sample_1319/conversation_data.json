    "Of course. Let's break down this question methodically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe goal is to find the tallest mountain that meets three criteria:\n1.  It must be a real, historical mountain (not a purely mythical one).\n2.  It must be mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*.\n3.  It must not be Mount Olympus, which is the tallest. We are looking for the second-tallest on this specific list.\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nFirst, we must compile a list of all mountains mentioned by name in the epic poem. The most prominent ones are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods. It's the most frequently mentioned mountain and serves as the divine base of operations. It is a real mountain in northern Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida:** A crucial location in the *Iliad*. Zeus often watches the Trojan War from its highest peak, Gargarus. This is the Mount Ida located near Troy in modern-day Turkey.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Fengari):** In Book 13, Poseidon sits atop the highest peak of Samothrace to watch the battle, as the island provides a clear view of Troy.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in Book 16 as the source of the ash wood for Achilles's famous spear, a gift from his father, Peleus. It's a real mountain in Thessaly, Greece.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned in Book 14 in the \"Deception of Zeus\" episode. Hera, on her journey, flies over several landmarks, including the snowy peak of Athos.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned twice in similes. In Book 2, the assembling Achaean army is compared to birds in the meadows of the Cayster River \"near the Asian meadow about the streams of Caÿster, that hither and thither fly,\" a region overlooked by Mount Tmolus. It is also mentioned in a similar context in Book 20. It is a real mountain range in ancient Lydia (modern-day Turkey).\n\n**Step 3: Verify They are Historical Mountains and Find Their Elevations**\nNow, let's confirm these are all real mountains and list their approximate maximum elevations to allow for comparison.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** ~2,918 meters (9,573 ft). This is our benchmark, which must be excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Modern: Bozdağ):** ~2,159 meters (7,083 ft).\n*   **Mount Athos:** ~2,033 meters (6,670 ft).\n*   **Mount Ida (Modern: Kaz Dağı):** ~1,774 meters (5,820 ft).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** ~1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Fengari):** ~1,611 meters (5,285 ft).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Heights to Find the Tallest After Olympus**\nWith Mount Olympus (2,918 m) removed from consideration, we can rank the remaining mountains by height:\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\nThe tallest mountain on the list, after Mount Olympus, is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Prominence in the story vs. physical height:** Mount Ida is far more central to the plot of the *Iliad* than Mount Tmolus. However, the question is about physical height, not narrative importance.\n*   **Historical Geography:** The mountains mentioned are all real places in Greece and Turkey (Anatolia), which reflects the geographical world known to the ancient Greeks.\n*   **Multiple Mountains with the Same Name:** It's important to specify that the Mount Ida of the *Iliad* is the one in Turkey, overlooking the Trojan plain, not the taller Mount Ida on Crete (2,456 m), which is associated with the birth of Zeus but is not the setting for the *Iliad's* events.\n*   **Specific Peaks:** The *Iliad* sometimes names specific peaks, like Gargarus on Mount Ida. For this analysis, we use the maximum elevation of the entire mountain range mentioned.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy identifying all mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, confirming their real-world locations and elevations, and excluding Mount Olympus as directed, we can rank the remaining mountains. The tallest among them is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
