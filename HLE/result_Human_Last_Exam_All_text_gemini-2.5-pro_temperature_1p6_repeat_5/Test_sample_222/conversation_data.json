    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Input Sequences and their DFTs**\n    *   We have a 4-point sequence `x(n) = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)}`.\n    *   Its 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is given as `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\n    *   We have another 4-point sequence `h(n) = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)}`.\n    *   Its 4-point DFT is given as `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n\n2.  **Define the Target Sequence**\n    *   We need to find the DFT of a new sequence, let's call it `y(n)`.\n    *   The sequence is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n        `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n    *   This is an 8-point sequence. Let's write out its elements:\n        *   `y(0) = x(0)`, `y(1) = h(0)`\n        *   `y(2) = x(1)`, `y(3) = h(1)`\n        *   `y(4) = x(2)`, `y(5) = h(2)`\n        *   `y(6) = x(3)`, `y(7) = h(3)`\n    *   This structure can be described by separating `y(n)` into its even and odd-indexed samples:\n        *   Even part: `y(2n) = x(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n        *   Odd part: `y(2n+1) = h(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n3.  **Relate the DFTs using the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Principle**\n    *   This structure is fundamental to the Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (DIT-FFT) algorithm. This algorithm shows how to compute the DFT of a large sequence from the DFTs of its smaller even and odd sub-sequences.\n    *   Let `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`.\n    *   Let `X(k)` be the 4-point DFT of the even part `x(n)`.\n    *   Let `H(k)` be the 4-point DFT of the odd part `h(n)`.\n    *   The relationship is given by the DIT butterfly equations for N=8:\n        *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`  for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n        *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `W_N^k` is the twiddle factor, defined as `W_N^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/N)`.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Question: \"4-point DFT\" for an 8-point Sequence**\n    *   The question asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. Let's call this `Y_4(k)`.\n    *   The standard definition of the M-point DFT of an N-point sequence `y(n)` (where `M < N`) is derived from the aliasing property of the DFT.\n    *   The relationship is `Y_M(k) = Y_N(k * N/M)`.\n    *   In our case, `N=8` and `M=4`. Therefore, `N/M = 2`.\n    *   The 4-point DFT `Y_4(k)` is related to the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` by:\n        `Y_4(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   So, we need to compute `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Components of the 8-point DFT**\n    *   We will use the DIT formulas from Step 3. We only need to calculate for the indices k=0 and k=2.\n    *   **Needed Twiddle Factors:**\n        *   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n        *   `W_8^2 = e^(-j * 2 * pi * 2 / 8) = e^(-j * pi / 2) = -j`\n    *   **Calculation for k=0:**\n        *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1) * 0 = 1`\n        *   `Y(0+4) = Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1) * 0 = 1`\n    *   **Calculation for k=2:**\n        *   `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n        *   `Y(2+4) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n6.  **Assemble the Final 4-point DFT**\n    *   We have found the necessary components of the 8-point DFT:\n        *   `Y(0) = 1`\n        *   `Y(2) = -1 - j`\n        *   `Y(4) = 1`\n        *   `Y(6) = -1 + j`\n    *   Now, we construct the 4-point DFT `Y_4(k) = [Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)]`.\n    *   `Y_4(0) = Y(0) = 1`\n    *   `Y_4(1) = Y(2) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Y_4(2) = Y(4) = 1`\n    *   `Y_4(3) = Y(6) = -1 + j`\n    *   The resulting 4-point DFT is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final result is obtained by listing the calculated components of the 4-point DFT in order.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
