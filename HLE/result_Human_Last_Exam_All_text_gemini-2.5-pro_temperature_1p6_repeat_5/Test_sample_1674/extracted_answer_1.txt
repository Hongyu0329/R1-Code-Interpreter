Yes, the theory can fail to hold. The reason is not a violation of the fundamental principle of time-reversal (a standard birefringent medium is reciprocal). Instead, the failure arises from a practical standpoint related to the vector nature of light. The birefringent medium deterministically transforms the input polarization before it enters the random medium. A simplified "theory" or a practical setup (like one using a single spatial light modulator) often relies on a scalar model, controlling only one polarization. This scalar control is likely insufficient to reverse the complex vector field that results from the combined effects of the birefringent plate and the random medium. The birefringent element makes the system's vectorial nature more pronounced and harder to approximate with a scalar model, thus causing the simplified theory to fail.
