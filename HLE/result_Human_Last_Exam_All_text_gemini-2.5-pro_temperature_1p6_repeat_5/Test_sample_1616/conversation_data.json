    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or shortening) is a historical sound rule in English where a long (tense) vowel or a diphthong becomes short (lax) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word.\n\nTo check if a word has undergone this change, we typically follow these steps:\n*   Identify a related word (often shorter) that shows the original long/tense vowel.\n*   Count the syllables in the word in question. It must have at least three.\n*   Check if the vowel in question is in the antepenultimate syllable.\n*   Confirm that this vowel is now short/lax.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word**\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Related word:** `south` (/saʊθ/), which has a long diphthong /aʊ/.\n    *   **Word analysis:** `southern` (/ˈsʌðərn/) has a short vowel /ʌ/.\n    *   **Syllable count:** `south-ern` has two syllables.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The word has undergone vowel shortening (/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/), but since it only has two syllables, this change is not due to *trisyllabic* laxing. The rule doesn't apply.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/), which has a long diphthong /aɪ/ in its stressed syllable.\n    *   **Word analysis:** `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/) has a short vowel /ɪ/ in the corresponding syllable.\n    *   **Syllable count:** `de-riv-a-tive` has four syllables. The syllable in question, `-riv-`, is the antepenultimate (third from the end).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The long vowel /aɪ/ in `derive` has become the short vowel /ɪ/ in the antepenultimate syllable of `derivative`. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene` (/səˈriːn/), which has a long vowel /iː/ in its stressed syllable.\n    *   **Word analysis:** `serenity` (/səˈrɛnəti/) has a short vowel /ɛ/ in the corresponding syllable.\n    *   **Syllable count:** `se-ren-i-ty` has four syllables. The syllable in question, `-ren-`, is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The long vowel /iː/ in `serene` has become the short vowel /ɛ/ in the antepenultimate syllable of `serenity`. This is another clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Related word:** `please` (/pliːz/), which has a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Word analysis:** `pleasant` (/ˈplɛzənt/) has a short vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable count:** `pleas-ant` has two syllables.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The word shows vowel shortening, but since it is a disyllabic word, it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. The rule doesn't apply.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Related word:** `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), which has a long diphthong /eɪ/. (The Latin root is `grātus`, with a long vowel).\n    *   **Word analysis:** `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) has a short vowel /æ/ in the stressed syllable.\n    *   **Syllable count:** `grat-i-tude` has three syllables. The syllable in question, `grat-`, is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The long vowel sound seen in `grateful` has become a short vowel in the antepenultimate syllable of `gratitude`. This word has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Related word:** `shade` (/ʃeɪd/), which has a long diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   **Word analysis:** `shadow` (/ˈʃædoʊ/) has a short vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Syllable count:** `shad-ow` has two syllables.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because the word has only two syllables, it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n**3. Final Analysis and Careful Points**\n\nThree words have undergone trisyllabic laxing: `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude`.\nThree words have not: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. All three are disyllabic, so the rule cannot apply.\n\nHowever, there is a further distinction.\n*   For `southern` and `pleasant`, their root words (`south`, `please`) contained a long vowel/diphthong, and the derived form shows a shortened vowel. They underwent a form of laxing, just not *trisyllabic* laxing.\n*   For `shadow`, the historical development is different. The Old English form `sceadwe` (shadow) already had a short vowel. The related word `shade` (from OE `sceadu`) had its vowel *lengthened* later in its history. Therefore, the word `shadow` did not undergo a process of shortening or laxing; it simply *retained* its original short vowel.\n\nSince `shadow` never had a long vowel that was subsequently shortened, it is the most definitive example of a word on the list that has not undergone any kind of laxing process, let alone trisyllabic laxing. The other two-syllable words underwent a different type of shortening. Therefore, `shadow` is the best answer.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
