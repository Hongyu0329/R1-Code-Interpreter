    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the character that the main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe main character and protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) is Adam Zamoyski. He is a man from the 21st century who is cryogenically frozen and later resurrected in a far-distant, post-human future.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the plot regarding the main character's significant relationships.**\nUpon his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski must navigate a highly complex and alien civilization. He forms several key relationships, but one, in particular, becomes central to his journey and the novel's political intrigue. He becomes involved with a powerful member of the ruling post-human civilization, known as the Inclines (or Incs).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific character the protagonist marries.**\nThe character that Adam Zamoyski enters into a union with is a female Incline. This \"marriage\" is a complex affair, serving as a political alliance, a social experiment, and a personal bond. Her name is Angelika.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **The nature of the \"marriage\":** It's important to understand that the marriage in the book is not a traditional human ceremony. It is a futuristic, strategic, and political union between a \"primitive\" resurrected human and a highly advanced post-human being.\n*   **Character's full designation:** While she is known as Angelika, her full designation within the story is more complex, often referred to as Angelika Angle. However, \"Angelika\" is the simple and correct name.\n*   **Distinguishing from other characters:** Adam interacts with many beings, including the entity responsible for his resurrection. It is crucial to correctly identify Angelika as the one he forms this marital alliance with.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the plot and the character arcs in \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" we can definitively state that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries the post-human Incline named Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
