    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\n\n*   **Object C:** A compact Riemann surface of genus g=3. This is a 1-dimensional complex manifold.\n*   **Object X:** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted C^(15). This is the space of unordered 15-tuples of points on C, which is equivalent to the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. X is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X):** This is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. For a smooth projective variety over the complex numbers, this is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** This is the rank of NS(X) as a free abelian group, also known as the Picard number, denoted ρ(X). We are asked to find the smallest and largest possible values of ρ(X), as it can vary depending on the specific choice of the genus 3 curve C.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi Group of X to the Jacobian of C\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the geometry of the symmetric power X = C^(15). There is a fundamental relationship between the symmetric powers of a curve and its Jacobian variety.\n\n*   **Jacobian Variety Jac(C):** For a curve C of genus g, its Jacobian Jac(C) is a g-dimensional abelian variety (a complex torus that is also a projective variety). For our case, g=3, so Jac(C) is a 3-dimensional abelian variety.\n*   **Abel-Jacobi Map:** There is a natural map `s: C^(n) -> Jac(C)` which sends an effective divisor D of degree n to the line bundle O(D) (viewed as a point in the component Pic^n(C), which is a translate of Jac(C)).\n*   **Projective Bundle Structure:** A key theorem by Kempf, Kleiman, and Laksov states that for `n >= 2g-1`, the Abel-Jacobi map `s: C^(n) -> Jac(C)` endows C^(n) with the structure of a projective bundle over Jac(C).\n    *   In our case, g=3 and n=15. We check the condition: `15 >= 2*3 - 1 = 5`. The condition holds.\n    *   The fiber of this bundle over a point representing a line bundle `L` in Jac(C) is the projective space `P(H^0(C, L))` of effective divisors linearly equivalent to `L`.\n    *   By the Riemann-Roch theorem, for a generic line bundle L of degree n, `h^0(C, L) = n - g + 1`. So the dimension of the projective space fiber is `r = h^0(C, L) - 1 = (n-g+1)-1 = n-g`.\n    *   For our problem, the fiber is a projective space of dimension `r = 15 - 3 = 12`. Thus, X = C^(15) is a P^12-bundle over Jac(C).\n*   **Picard Number of a Projective Bundle:** For a projective bundle `p: X -> B`, the Picard group (and thus the Neron-Severi group rank) has a simple relationship: `Pic(X) ≅ p*Pic(B) ⊕ Z·H`, where H is the class of a hyperplane section of the fibers. This implies that their ranks are related by:\n    `ρ(X) = ρ(B) + 1`.\n*   **Conclusion of this step:** We have established the crucial formula: `ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`. The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of the Picard number `ρ(Jac(C))` for a genus 3 curve C.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Smallest Possible Rank of NS(Jac(C))\n\nThe rank `ρ(Jac(C))` depends on the algebro-geometric properties of the curve C.\n\n*   **Generic Case:** A \"generic\" curve C of genus 3 is non-hyperelliptic and has no automorphisms other than the identity.\n*   **Endomorphism Ring:** For such a generic curve, the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian is as small as possible: `End(Jac(C)) ≅ Z`.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group:** When `End(Jac(C)) ≅ Z`, the Neron-Severi group of Jac(C) is generated by the single class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor, `Θ`). So, `NS(Jac(C)) ≅ Z[Θ]`.\n*   **Smallest Rank:** The rank is therefore `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`. This is the minimum possible rank for any principally polarized abelian variety.\n*   **Smallest Rank for X:** Using our formula, the smallest possible rank for `NS(X)` is `ρ(X)_min = ρ(Jac(C))_min + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Largest Possible Rank of NS(Jac(C))\n\nThe rank `ρ(Jac(C))` is maximized for \"special\" curves, particularly those with complex multiplication (CM) or whose Jacobians are isogenous to products of lower-dimensional varieties.\n\n*   **Special Curves:** The largest Picard numbers are achieved for curves C whose Jacobians have the largest possible endomorphism algebras. This typically happens when `Jac(C)` is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves with CM.\n*   **Torelli's Theorem Constraint:** An indecomposable principally polarized abelian variety corresponds to an irreducible curve. This means `Jac(C)` cannot be a direct product of PPAVs, but it can be isogenous to a product.\n*   **Known Maximum for Genus 3:** The determination of the maximal Picard number for a Jacobian of a given genus is a non-trivial problem. For genus g=3, it is a known result that the maximum possible Picard number is 7.\n*   **Example Achieving the Maximum:** This maximum is achieved, for instance, by the hyperelliptic curve defined by the equation `y^2 = x^8 + 1`.\n    *   This curve has a large automorphism group.\n    *   Its Jacobian `Jac(C)` is isogenous to a product of three elliptic curves, all of which have complex multiplication.\n    *   The rich endomorphism structure leads to a large Neron-Severi group, with `ρ(Jac(C)) = 7`.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to rely on established results for this maximum value, as its calculation from first principles is highly advanced. The maximum possible rank for the Neron-Severi group of an abelian threefold is `g^2 = 9`, but this maximum is not achieved by the Jacobian of a smooth curve. The \"Jacobian\" condition imposes further constraints.\n*   **Largest Rank for X:** Using our formula, the largest possible rank for `NS(X)` is `ρ(X)_max = ρ(Jac(C))_max + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8`.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n1.  The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve C is given by `ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`.\n2.  The smallest possible rank `ρ(Jac(C))` is 1, which occurs for a generic curve C. This gives the smallest rank `ρ(C^(15)) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n3.  The largest possible rank `ρ(Jac(C))` for a genus 3 curve is 7, achieved by special curves like `y^2 = x^8 + 1`. This gives the largest rank `ρ(C^(15)) = 7 + 1 = 8`.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 8.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 8.>>>"
