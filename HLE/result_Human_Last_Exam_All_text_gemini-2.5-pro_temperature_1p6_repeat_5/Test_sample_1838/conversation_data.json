    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the central pixel of the line using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Input and the Goal**\n*   **Start Point (x1, y1):** (1, 1)\n*   **End Point (x2, y2):** (11, 5)\n*   **Goal:** Find the coordinates of the central pixel on the line drawn between these two points using Bresenham's algorithm.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Initial Parameters for Bresenham's Algorithm**\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y (Δx and Δy):**\n    *   Δx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Determine the slope's nature:**\n    *   The slope `m = Δy / Δx = 4 / 10 = 0.4`.\n    *   Since `0 < m < 1`, the x-coordinate will be incremented by 1 at each step, and we will decide whether to increment the y-coordinate.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Total Number of Pixels**\nBresenham's algorithm will plot one pixel for each increment along the major axis (the axis with the larger delta), plus the starting pixel.\n*   The major axis is x, since `Δx > Δy`.\n*   The total number of pixels will be `Δx + 1`.\n*   Total pixels = 10 + 1 = 11.\n\n### **Step 4: Find the Position of the Central Pixel**\nSince there are 11 pixels in total (an odd number), there will be a single, unique central pixel. The position of the central pixel in a sequence of 11 items is the `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6th` item.\nOur task is now to find the coordinates of the 6th pixel generated by the algorithm.\n\n### **Step 5: Trace the Algorithm to Find the 6th Pixel**\nWe will list the pixels generated in sequence. The first pixel is the starting point (1, 1). We need to find the next 5 pixels to get to the 6th one.\n\n*   **Decision Parameter (p):** The initial decision parameter is `p = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2`.\n*   **Algorithm Rules (for 0 < m < 1):**\n    *   Always increment x.\n    *   If `p < 0`, the next pixel is (x+1, y), and `p` is updated by `p = p + 2 * Δy`.\n    *   If `p ≥ 0`, the next pixel is (x+1, y+1), and `p` is updated by `p = p + 2 * Δy - 2 * Δx`.\n\nLet's trace the points:\n\n*   **Pixel 1:** **(1, 1)** (Starting point)\n    *   `x=1`, `y=1`. Initial `p = -2`.\n\n*   **Pixel 2:** `p = -2` is less than 0.\n    *   Keep y the same: `y = 1`.\n    *   Increment x: `x = 2`.\n    *   Next Pixel: **(2, 1)**\n    *   Update `p = -2 + 2*Δy = -2 + 8 = 6`.\n\n*   **Pixel 3:** `p = 6` is greater than or equal to 0.\n    *   Increment y: `y = 2`.\n    *   Increment x: `x = 3`.\n    *   Next Pixel: **(3, 2)**\n    *   Update `p = 6 + 2*Δy - 2*Δx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n\n*   **Pixel 4:** `p = -6` is less than 0.\n    *   Keep y the same: `y = 2`.\n    *   Increment x: `x = 4`.\n    *   Next Pixel: **(4, 2)**\n    *   Update `p = -6 + 2*Δy = -6 + 8 = 2`.\n\n*   **Pixel 5:** `p = 2` is greater than or equal to 0.\n    *   Increment y: `y = 3`.\n    *   Increment x: `x = 5`.\n    *   Next Pixel: **(5, 3)**\n    *   Update `p = 2 + 2*Δy - 2*Δx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n\n*   **Pixel 6:** `p = -10` is less than 0.\n    *   Keep y the same: `y = 3`.\n    *   Increment x: `x = 6`.\n    *   Next Pixel: **(6, 3)**\n\nWe have now found the 6th pixel in the sequence.\n\n### **Alternative Method (Midpoint Check)**\nA much quicker way for this specific problem is to find the geometric midpoint of the line.\n*   Midpoint_x = (x1 + x2) / 2 = (1 + 11) / 2 = 6\n*   Midpoint_y = (y1 + y2) / 2 = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3\nThe midpoint of the line is exactly (6, 3). Since this point has integer coordinates, it represents a pixel. For a symmetrical algorithm like Bresenham's, this pixel will be the exact center of the generated line. This confirms our result from the step-by-step trace.\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe coordinates of the 6th pixel, which is the central pixel, are (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
