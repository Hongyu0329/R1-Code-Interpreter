    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify an animal from the given list that possesses the auditory capability to detect the sound produced by a human muscle twitch. This requires knowing two key pieces of information: the frequency of sound produced by a muscle twitch and the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the frequency of a human muscle twitch.**\nWhen a human muscle contracts, it produces a very low-frequency sound, often referred to as mechanomyography (MMG) or phonomyography (PMG). The frequency of this sound is extremely low, typically falling in the range of 5 Hz to 25 Hz. This range is largely classified as infrasound (sounds below 20 Hz), which is the lower limit of typical human hearing.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the hearing range of each animal in the answer choices.**\n*   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz (45 kHz). They are excellent at hearing high-frequency sounds but their low-frequency hearing is not better than humans and does not extend down to the 5-25 Hz range.\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for using echolocation, which involves producing and hearing extremely high-frequency sounds (ultrasound). Their hearing range is typically between 2,000 Hz and 110,000 Hz (110 kHz). They are essentially deaf to the low frequencies of a muscle twitch.\n*   **C. Herring:** Certain species of fish, including herring, have a remarkable auditory system. A special connection between their swim bladder (which acts as a pressure detector) and their inner ear allows them to detect an incredibly wide range of frequencies. Their hearing can extend from below 1 Hz (deep infrasound) up to 180,000 Hz (ultrasound). This range comfortably covers the 5-25 Hz frequency of a muscle twitch.\n*   **D. Whale:** Whales, particularly large baleen whales like the Blue Whale or Fin Whale, are known to communicate using very low-frequency sounds (infrasound) that can travel vast distances underwater. Their hearing range can go as low as 10-20 Hz. So, a whale is also a possible candidate. However, the herring's documented hearing range is famously broad and definitely includes these low frequencies.\n*   **E. Human:** The standard range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). Since muscle twitches produce sounds around and often below 20 Hz, they are generally inaudible to humans without amplification.\n\n**Step 4: Compare and select the best answer.**\n*   The sound of a muscle twitch (~5-25 Hz) is below the hearing threshold of dogs and bats.\n*   It is at the absolute lowest limit of, or below, the human hearing range, making it inaudible for most people.\n*   Both some whales and herring can hear in this infrasound range.\n*   However, herring are specifically known for their extraordinarily wide hearing range, which is a well-documented biological adaptation. They are highly sensitive to low-frequency pressure changes. Therefore, of the choices given, the herring is an excellent example of an animal that *might be able* to hear a sound as faint and low-pitched as a human muscle twitch.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of frequency ranges, the herring has the auditory system best suited to detect the low-frequency sounds produced by muscle contractions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
