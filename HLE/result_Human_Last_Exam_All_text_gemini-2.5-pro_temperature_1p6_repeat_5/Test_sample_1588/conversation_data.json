    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula expresses the logarithm of the product of two matrix exponentials, $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, as a series in terms of the operators $X$ and $Y$ and their repeated commutators.\nThe formula is given by:\n$Z = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}([X, [X, Y]] - [Y, [X, Y]]) + \\dots$\nThe terms in this expansion are *Lie polynomials*, which are linear combinations of nested commutators. The *order* (or degree) of a term is the total number of $X$ and $Y$ operators it contains.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Question to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This is equivalent to asking for the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree 10 that can be formed from two generators, $X$ and $Y$.\nIn mathematical terms, we need to find the dimension of the degree-10 homogeneous subspace of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements. Let's call this dimension $d_{10}(2)$.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce Witt's Formula**\n\nWitt's formula provides the dimension of the $n$-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on $k$ generators. The formula is:\n$d_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nWhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree of the polynomials (the order in the BCH expansion). In our case, $n = 10$.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators (the variables in the expansion). In our case, $k = 2$ (for $X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is taken over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**Step 4: Define and Calculate the Möbius Function ($\\mu$)**\n\nThe Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ is defined as:\n*   $\\mu(d) = 1$ if $d$ is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n*   $\\mu(d) = -1$ if $d$ is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n*   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\nAlso, $\\mu(1)=1$.\n\nFor our problem, $n=10$. The divisors of 10 are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\nLet's calculate $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:\n*   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n*   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 has one prime factor)\n*   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 has one prime factor)\n*   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 has two distinct prime factors)\n\n**Step 5: Apply Witt's Formula and Calculate the Result**\n\nNow we substitute our values into Witt's formula:\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\nLet's expand the sum term by term:\n*   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n*   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = -1 \\cdot 2^5 = -32$\n*   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = -1 \\cdot 2^2 = -4$\n*   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$\n\nNow, sum these values and divide by $n=10$:\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2)$\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} (1026 - 36)$\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} (990)$\n$d_{10}(2) = 99$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe dimension of the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables is 99. This means there are 99 linearly independent terms in the BCH expansion at order 10. For the generic formula, each of these independent terms will have a non-zero coefficient. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
