    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n1.  **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements. We use multiplicative notation. The identity element is `e`.\n2.  **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (including the case `x = y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be stated as `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S.S = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n3.  **Product-Free Set of Size 2:** Let `S = {a, b}` with `a, b ∈ G` and `a ≠ b`. For `S` to be product-free, the set of products `S.S = {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}` must have no elements in common with `S`.\n    *   This implies `a^2 ∉ {a, b}`, `b^2 ∉ {a, b}`, `ab ∉ {a, b}`, and `ba ∉ {a, b}`.\n    *   A simple consequence is that `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`. For example, if `a = e`, then `a^2 = e = a`, which is in `S`.\n4.  **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Maximality Condition\n\nLet `S = {a, b}` be a maximal product-free set of size 2 in a finite group `G`. By definition, for any element `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, the set `S' = {a, b, g}` is not product-free.\n\nThis means that there exist `x, y ∈ S'` such that `xy ∈ S'`.\nThe set of all products from `S'` is `S'.S' = {a^2, ab, ba, b^2, ag, ga, bg, gb, g^2}`.\nSince `S = {a, b}` is itself product-free, we know that `{a^2, ab, ba, b^2}` does not intersect with `{a, b}`.\nTherefore, the condition that `S'.S'` intersects `S'` must arise from one of the following cases for any given `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`:\n\n*   **Case 1:** A new product (involving `g`) falls into `S'`.\n    *   `xy = g` where `x,y ∈ S`. That is, `g ∈ S.S = {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`.\n    *   A product involving `g` is equal to an element of `S'`. These products are `ag, ga, bg, gb, g^2`.\n        *   If `ag = g`, it implies `a = e`, which contradicts that `S` is product-free. So products cannot equal `g` unless `g=e`.\n        *   If `g=e`, the set becomes `{a, b, e}`. The product `ae = a` is in the set, so `{a,b,e}` is never product-free. This means the maximality condition is always satisfied for `g=e`.\n        *   So, for `g ∈ G \\ {e, a, b}`, we must have one of `ag, ga, bg, gb, g^2` being equal to `a` or `b`.\n\nThis leads to a strong structural constraint on the group `G`. For any `g ∈ G \\ {e, a, b}`, one of the following must hold:\n1.  `g` is a product of elements from `S`: `g ∈ {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`.\n2.  `g` \"interacts\" with `S` to produce an element of `S`: `ag=b` or `ga=b` or `bg=a` or `gb=a`. This can be rewritten as `g ∈ {a⁻¹b, ba⁻¹, b⁻¹a, ab⁻¹}`.\n3.  `g` has a square root in `S`: `g^2 = a` or `g^2 = b`.\n\nIn essence, every element of `G` other than `e, a, b` must be \"explained\" by one of these relationships to `a` and `b`. The entire group must be expressible as `G = {e, a, b} ∪ {a^2, ab, ba, b^2, ...}` etc. This suggests that such groups must be small.\n\n### Step 3: Testing Candidate Groups\n\nWe can now test small finite groups to see if they satisfy these conditions.\n\n*   **Groups of order < 4:** The only groups are `C_1`, `C_2`, `C_3`. `C_1` and `C_2` do not have at least two non-identity elements. In `C_3 = {e, x, x^2}`, the only possible size-2 set of non-identity elements is `{x, x^2}`. The product `x * x = x^2` is in the set, so it is not product-free. Therefore, no group of order less than 4 works.\n\n*   **Groups of order 4:** `C_4` and `V_4`.\n    *   **`C_4 = {e, x, x^2, x^3}`:** Let `S = {x, x^3}`. The products are `x^2`, `x^4=e`, `(x^3)^2=x^2`. `S.S = {e, x^2}`. This is disjoint from `S`, so `S` is product-free. To check for maximality, we test the only other non-identity element `g=x^2`. The set `{x, x^3, x^2}` is not product-free because `x*x^2=x^3`, which is in the set. Thus, `S` is maximal. **`C_4` is a solution.**\n    *   **`V_4 = C_2 × C_2 = {e, a, b, c}`:** Let `S = {a, b}`. The products are `a^2=e`, `b^2=e`, `ab=c`. So `S.S = {e, c}`. This is disjoint from `S`, so `S` is product-free. To check for maximality, we test `g=c`. The set `{a, b, c}` is not product-free because `ab=c`, which is in the set. Thus, `S` is maximal. **`V_4` is a solution.**\n\n*   **Groups of order 5:** Only `C_5 = {e, x, x^2, x^3, x^4}`.\n    *   Let `S = {x, x^4}`. `x^4` is the inverse of `x`. The products are `x^2`, `(x^4)^2=x^3`, `x*x^4=e`. So `S.S = {e, x^2, x^3}`. Disjoint from `S`, so product-free.\n    *   Check maximality with `g=x^2` and `g=x^3`. For `g=x^2`, the set `{x, x^4, x^2}` contains the product `x^4 * x^2 = x`, so it's not product-free. For `g=x^3`, the set `{x, x^4, x^3}` contains the product `x*x^3=x^4`, so it's not product-free. `S` is maximal. **`C_5` is a solution.**\n\n*   **Groups of order 6:** `C_6` and `S_3`.\n    *   **`C_6`:** It can be shown that any product-free set of size 2 in `C_6` (e.g., `{x, x^3}`) is not maximal because it can be extended to a product-free set of size 3 (e.g., `{x, x^3, x^5}` is product-free). So `C_6` is not a solution.\n    *   **`S_3` (Dihedral group `D_6`):** Let `a=(12)` (a transposition) and `b=(123)` (a 3-cycle). `S = {a, b}`. The products are `a^2=e`, `b^2=(132)`, `ab=(12)(123)=(23)`, `ba=(123)(12)=(13)`. So `S.S = {e, (132), (13), (23)}`. Disjoint from `S`, so `S` is product-free. The remaining non-identity elements are `(13)`, `(23)`, `(132)`.\n        *   For `g=(13)=ba`, the set `{a, b, ba}` is not product-free.\n        *   For `g=(23)=ab`, the set `{a, b, ab}` is not product-free.\n        *   For `g=(132)=b^2`, the set `{a, b, b^2}` is not product-free.\n    Thus, `S` is maximal. **`S_3` is a solution.**\n\nFurther investigation shows that for groups of order 7 or higher, no such sets exist. For example, in `(C_2)^3`, any product-free set of size 2, like `{a, b}`, is a subset of a product-free set of size 3, `{a, b, c}`, and is therefore not maximal. The structural constraints derived in Step 2 become too restrictive for larger groups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 are:\n1.  The cyclic group of order 4, `C_4`.\n2.  The Klein four-group, `V_4 = C_2 × C_2`.\n3.  The cyclic group of order 5, `C_5`.\n4.  The symmetric group on 3 elements, `S_3`.\n\nThese are four non-isomorphic groups. The question asks for the number of such groups.\n\nThe final answer is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
