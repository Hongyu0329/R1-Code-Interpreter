    "Answering the question: \"How many power subgroups are there in the semidihedral group of size 512?\" requires a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Semidihedral Group `SD_512`**\n\nThe semidihedral group of size `2^n`, denoted `SD_{2^n}`, is defined by the presentation:\n`SD_{2^n} = <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, sr = r^k s>` where `k = -1 + 2^(n-2)`.\n\nIn this problem, the size of the group is 512, which is `2^9`. So, we have `n = 9`. The group is `G = SD_{2^9}`.\nThe presentation for `G` is:\n*   `r^(2^(9-1)) = r^256 = 1`\n*   `s^2 = 1`\n*   `sr = r^(-1 + 2^(9-2)) s = r^(-1 + 128) s = r^127 s`\n\nThe group `G` has 512 elements, which can be represented as `r^i` for `0 <= i < 256` (forming a cyclic subgroup `<r>` of order 256) and `r^i s` for `0 <= i < 256`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup `H` of a group `G` is a power subgroup if there exists an integer `m` such that `H` is the set of all `m`-th powers of elements in `G`. This is denoted as `H = G^m = {g^m | g âˆˆ G}`. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups `G^m` as `m` varies over the integers.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate `g^m` for all elements `g` in `G`**\n\nWe need to compute the `m`-th power for both types of elements in `G`: `r^i` and `r^i s`.\n\n*   **For elements of the form `g = r^i`:**\n    `g^m = (r^i)^m = r^(im)`.\n    The set of these powers is `{(r^i)^m | 0 <= i < 256} = <r^m>`. Using properties of cyclic groups, this is equal to `<r^gcd(m, 256)>`.\n\n*   **For elements of the form `g = r^i s`:**\n    First, we find the square of these elements:\n    `(r^i s)^2 = (r^i s)(r^i s) = r^i(sr^i)s`.\n    We use the relation `sr^i = r^(127i)s` (derived from `sr=r^{127}s`).\n    So, `(r^i s)^2 = r^i(r^(127i)s)s = r^(i + 127i)s^2 = r^(128i)`.\n    Note that `r^128` is an element of order 2.\n\n    Now we compute `(r^i s)^m` based on the parity of `m`.\n    *   **If `m` is even (let `m = 2j`):**\n        `(r^i s)^m = (r^i s)^(2j) = ((r^i s)^2)^j = (r^(128i))^j = r^(128ij)`.\n    *   **If `m` is odd (let `m = 2j+1`):**\n        `(r^i s)^m = (r^i s)^(2j+1) = ((r^i s)^2)^j (r^i s) = (r^(128i))^j (r^i s) = r^(128ij) r^i s = r^(i(128j+1))s`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of `G^m`**\n\nNow we combine the sets of powers for different `m`.\n\n*   **Case 1: `m` is odd**\n    `G^m = { (r^i)^m } U { (r^i s)^m }`.\n    Since `m` is odd, `gcd(m, 256) = 1`. So, `{ (r^i)^m } = <r^1> = <r>`. The map `x -> mx` permutes the exponents mod 256.\n    For `{ (r^i s)^m } = { r^(i(128j+1))s }`, the coefficient `128j+1` is odd. So, `gcd(128j+1, 256) = 1`. As `i` runs from 0 to 255, the exponent `i(128j+1) mod 256` also runs through all values from 0 to 255. This means `{ (r^i s)^m } = { r^k s | 0 <= k < 256 }`, which is the set of all elements in `G` not in `<r>`.\n    Therefore, for any odd `m`, `G^m = <r> U (G \\ <r>) = G`. This gives us **one** power subgroup: `G` itself.\n\n*   **Case 2: `m` is even**\n    Let `m = 2^k * q`, where `q` is odd and `k >= 1`.\n    The set of powers of elements from `<r>` is `{ (r^i)^m } = <r^m> = <r^gcd(m, 256)> = <r^gcd(2^k q, 2^8)> = <r^(2^k)>`.\n    The set of powers of elements of the form `r^i s` is `{ (r^i s)^m } = { r^(128ij) }`, where `m=2j`, so `j=m/2 = 2^(k-1)q`.\n    The exponent is `128 * i * 2^(k-1)q = 2^7 * i * 2^(k-1)q = i*q*2^(k+6)`.\n    The set of these elements is `<r^(gcd(q*2^(k+6), 256))> = <r^(2^min(k+6, 8))>`.\n    So, `G^m = <r^(2^k)> U <r^(2^min(k+6, 8))>`.\n    Since `k >= 1`, `k+6 > k`, the second subgroup is always a subgroup of the first.\n    Thus, `G^m = <r^(2^k)>`.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nWe need to count the number of unique subgroups generated by this process.\n\n1.  From odd `m`, we get one subgroup: `G`.\n2.  From even `m = 2^k q`, we get subgroups of the form `<r^(2^k)>`. We need to see how many distinct subgroups this form can generate as `k` varies. The order of `r` is `2^8=256`.\n    *   `k=1`: `G^m = <r^2>`. (Order `256/2 = 128`)\n    *   `k=2`: `G^m = <r^4>`. (Order `256/4 = 64`)\n    *   `k=3`: `G^m = <r^8>`. (Order `256/8 = 32`)\n    *   `k=4`: `G^m = <r^16>`. (Order `256/16 = 16`)\n    *   `k=5`: `G^m = <r^32>`. (Order `256/32 = 8`)\n    *   `k=6`: `G^m = <r^64>`. (Order `256/64 = 4`)\n    *   `k=7`: `G^m = <r^128>`. (Order `256/128 = 2`)\n    *   `k=8`: `G^m = <r^256> = {1}`. (Order `256/256 = 1`)\n    *   For `k > 8`, `r^(2^k) = (r^256)^(2^(k-8)) = 1^(2^(k-8)) = 1`, so `G^m` is also the trivial subgroup `{1}`.\n\n    The distinct subgroups generated from even values of `m` are `<r^2>`, `<r^4>`, `<r^8>`, `<r^16>`, `<r^32>`, `<r^64>`, `<r^128>`, and `{1}`. This is a total of **eight** distinct subgroups.\n\n**Final Count:**\n\nCombining the results from both cases (odd and even `m`), the set of all power subgroups of `SD_512` is:\n`{ G, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, {1} }`\n\nThese are `1 + 8 = 9` distinct subgroups.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation: For a semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}`, the number of power subgroups is `n`. For `SD_512 = SD_{2^9}`, we have `n=9`. The number of power subgroups is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
