    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2, i.e., an element `x` such that `x^2=1` and `x` is not the identity. To find the number of involutions in the Projective Special Unitary Group `G = PSU(4, 997)`, we will determine the conjugacy classes of involutions in `G` and sum their sizes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Group PSU(4, 997)**\n\n*   The group is `G = PSU(n, q)` with `n=4` and `q=997`. `PSU(n, q)` is the projective special unitary group, defined as `PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`.\n*   `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary Group, consisting of `n x n` matrices `T` over the field `F_{q^2}` that satisfy `T^H T = I` (unitary condition) and `det(T) = 1` (special condition). The superscript `H` denotes the conjugate transpose, where the conjugation is the field automorphism of `F_{q^2}` over `F_q`.\n*   `Z(SU(n, q))` is the center of `SU(n, q)`. It consists of scalar matrices `λI` where `λ^{gcd(n, q+1)} = 1`.\n*   For our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. `q+1 = 998`. The size of the center is `d = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, `Z(SU(4, 997)) = {I, -I}`.\n*   The order of `PSU(4, q)` is given by `|PSU(4,q)| = (1/d) * q^{n(n-1)/2} * Π_{i=2 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`.\n    For `n=4, q=997, d=2`:\n    `|PSU(4, 997)| = (1/2) * q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`.\n\n**Step 2: Lifting Involutions to SU(4, 997)**\n\nAn element `g ∈ PSU(4,q)` is an involution if `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1`. If `g` is the image of `T ∈ SU(4,q)` under the projection map, then `g^2 = 1` implies that `T^2 ∈ Z(SU(4,q))`.\nSince `Z(SU(4,997)) = {I, -I}`, we must find the number of elements `T` in `SU(4,997)` such that `T^2=I` or `T^2=-I` (excluding `T` itself being in the center). The images of these elements will form the set of involutions in `PSU(4,997)`.\n\n**Step 3: Case 1: Elements `T` with `T^2 = I`**\n\nThese are the involutions in `SU(4,997)`. An involution is diagonalizable with eigenvalues `±1`. Since `det(T)=1`, the number of `-1` eigenvalues must be even. The possible multisets of eigenvalues are:\n1.  `(1, 1, 1, 1)`: This corresponds to `T=I`, which is in the center. Its image is the identity in `PSU`, so we discard it.\n2.  `(1, 1, -1, -1)`: This corresponds to a non-central involution. All such involutions in `SU(4,q)` are conjugate. Let's call this class `C_1`.\n3.  `(-1, -1, -1, -1)`: This corresponds to `T=-I`, which is also in the center. Discard.\n\nSo, we have one class of involutions `C_1` in `SU(4,q)`. An element `T_1` from this class has a 2-dimensional eigenspace for `+1` and a 2-dimensional eigenspace for `-1`.\nThe centralizer `C_{SU(4,q)}(T_1)` is the group `S(U(2,q) x U(2,q))`. Its order is `(q+1)|SU(2,q)|^2 = (q+1)[q(q^2-1)]^2`.\nThe image of `T_1` in `PSU(4,q)` is an involution `t_1`. The size of its conjugacy class is `N_1 = |SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(T_1)|`.\n`N_1 = [q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [(q+1)q^2(q^2-1)^2]`\n`N_1 = q^4 (q^3+1)(q^4-1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1))`\n`N_1 = q^4 (q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1))`\n`N_1 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n\n**Step 4: Case 2: Elements `T` with `T^2 = -I`**\n\nThe existence and structure of these \"quasi-involutions\" depend on `q mod 4`.\n*   We have `q = 997`. `997 = 4 * 249 + 1`, so `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`.\n*   This implies `-1` is a square in the base field `F_q`.\n*   In this case, it can be shown that such elements `T` exist and form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4,q)`.\n*   Let `t_2` be the image of such an element in `PSU(4,q)`. The centralizer of `t_2` in `PSU(4,q)` is known to be isomorphic to `PGL(2,q)`.\n*   `|PGL(2,q)| = (q^2-1)(q^2-q)/(q-1) = q(q^2-1)`.\n*   The size of this conjugacy class, `N_2`, is:\n    `N_2 = |PSU(4,q)| / |C_{PSU(4,q)}(t_2)|`\n    `N_2 = [q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) / 2] / [q(q^2-1)]`\n    `N_2 = q^5(q^3+1)(q^4-1) / 2`\n\n**Step 5: Total Number of Involutions**\n\nThe total number of involutions in `PSU(4,997)` is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint conjugacy classes:\n`N = N_1 + N_2`\n`N = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + [q^5(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / 2`\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nWe substitute `q=997` into the formulas for `N_1` and `N_2`.\n\nFor `N_1`:\n`N_1 = 997^4(997^2 - 997 + 1)(997^2 + 1)`\n`N_1 = 997^4(993013)(994010)`\n`N_1 = 975,276,239,196,881,919,489,053,330`\n\nFor `N_2`:\n`N_2 = [997^5(997^3 + 1)(997^4 - 1)] / 2`\n`N_2 = [997^5(991026974)(988045504080)] / 2`\n`N_2 = 4,822,908,657,648,936,901,840,801,643,251,334,070`\n\nTotal Number `N = N_1 + N_2`:\n`N = 975,276,239,196,881,919,489,053,330 + 4,822,908,657,648,936,901,840,801,643,251,334,070`\n`N = 4,832,661,420,040,905,721,035,692,176,584,667,400`\n\n<<<4832661420040905721035692176584667400>>>"
