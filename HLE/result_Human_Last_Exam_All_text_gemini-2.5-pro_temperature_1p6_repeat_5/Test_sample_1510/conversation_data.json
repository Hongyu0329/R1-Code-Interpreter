    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional plane symmetry groups. They classify all repeating patterns in a 2D plane based on their symmetries (translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections).\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, the associated point group describes the symmetries of the pattern around a single point, ignoring the translational symmetries. These symmetries are rotations and reflections.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements (i.e., distinct symmetry operations) it contains.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups for which the associated point group has exactly two elements (order 2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify All 2D Crystallographic Point Groups\n\nDue to the crystallographic restriction theorem, only rotations of order 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are allowed in a crystal lattice. The 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups are:\n\n| Point Group (IUC notation) | Point Group (Schönflies notation) | Symmetry Operations                                       | Order |\n| :------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---- |\n| 1                          | C₁                               | Identity                                                  | 1     |\n| **2**                      | **C₂**                           | **Identity, 180° rotation**                               | **2** |\n| **m**                      | **Cₛ**                           | **Identity, reflection**                                  | **2** |\n| 3                          | C₃                               | Identity, 120° rotation, 240° rotation                    | 3     |\n| 4                          | C₄                               | Identity, 90°, 180°, 270° rotations                       | 4     |\n| 2mm                        | C₂ᵥ                              | Identity, 180° rotation, 2 perpendicular reflections      | 4     |\n| 6                          | C₆                               | Identity, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° rotations            | 6     |\n| 3m                         | C₃ᵥ                              | Rotations of order 3, 3 reflections                       | 6     |\n| 4mm                        | C₄ᵥ                              | Rotations of order 4, 4 reflections                       | 8     |\n| 6mm                        | C₆ᵥ                              | Rotations of order 6, 6 reflections                       | 12    |\n\n### Step 3: Find the Point Groups of Order 2\n\nFrom the table above, the point groups with an order of 2 are:\n1.  **Point Group 2 (C₂):** Contains the identity and a 180° rotation.\n2.  **Point Group m (Cₛ):** Contains the identity and a reflection across a line.\n\n### Step 4: List the 17 Wallpaper Groups and Identify their Point Groups\n\nNow we need to find which of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to point groups '2' or 'm'.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 2 (C₂):**\n    There is only one such group. It has 2-fold rotation centers but no reflectional symmetry.\n    1.  **p2**\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group m (Cₛ):**\n    These groups have reflectional symmetry but no rotational symmetry other than the trivial 360° rotation. The point group of a wallpaper group with glide reflections is still 'm', because a glide reflection is composed of a reflection and a translation, and the point group ignores the translation part. There are three such groups:\n    2.  **pm:** Contains reflection lines (primitive cell).\n    3.  **pg:** Contains glide reflection lines but no simple reflection lines (primitive cell).\n    4.  **cm:** Contains both reflection and glide reflection lines (centered cell).\n\n*   **Other wallpaper groups for completeness:**\n    *   Point group 1 (Order 1): p1\n    *   Point group 2mm (Order 4): p2mm, p2mg, p2gg, c2mm\n    *   Point group 3 (Order 3): p3\n    *   Point group 3m (Order 6): p3m1, p31m\n    *   Point group 4 (Order 4): p4\n    *   Point group 4mm (Order 8): p4mm, p4gm\n    *   Point group 6 (Order 6): p6\n    *   Point group 6mm (Order 12): p6mm\n\n### Step 5: Count the Results\n\nBy counting the wallpaper groups identified in Step 4, we have:\n*   One group (p2) with point group 2.\n*   Three groups (pm, pg, cm) with point group m.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 3 = 4 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the total count from the analysis above.\n\n<<<4>>>"
