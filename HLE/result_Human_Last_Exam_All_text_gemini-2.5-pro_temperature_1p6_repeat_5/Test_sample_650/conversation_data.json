    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Purpose:** The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a base `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. For example, `IMAG(25, 2)` would produce the binary representation (11001). This is the standard \"repeated division\" algorithm for base conversion.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Algorithm into Parts:** The algorithm consists of three main parts:\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization:** Operations performed once before the loop starts.\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop:** A loop that executes multiple times. This is usually the dominant part for complexity analysis.\n    *   **Step 3: Return:** A single operation at the end.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cost of Each Part:** We assume the standard RAM model of computation, where basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on integers that fit within a machine word take constant time, denoted as O(1).\n\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):**\n        *   `i := 0;`: 1 assignment operation, O(1).\n        *   `x := n;`: 1 assignment operation, O(1).\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: 1 division operation, O(1).\n        *   `a_0 := x — qc;`: 1 multiplication and 1 subtraction, O(1).\n        The total time for initialization is constant: O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) = O(1).\n\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):**\n        *   **Loop Body Analysis (2.1):** We need to find the cost of a single iteration.\n            *   `i := i + 1;`: 1 addition and 1 assignment, O(1).\n            *   `x := q;`: 1 assignment, O(1).\n            *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: 1 division, O(1).\n            *   `a_i := x — qc;`: 1 multiplication and 1 subtraction, O(1).\n            The total cost of a single loop iteration is constant: O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) = O(1).\n        *   **Number of Iterations:** The overall complexity of the loop is `(Number of Iterations) * (Cost per Iteration)`. Since the cost per iteration is O(1), we need to find the number of iterations.\n            *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n            *   Let's trace the value of `q`. Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n            *   After the 1st iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋` and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is equivalent to `⌊n/c^2⌋`.\n            *   After the `k`-th iteration, the value of `q` becomes `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n            *   The loop will terminate when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`.\n            *   The condition `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0` is true if and only if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which can be rewritten as `n < c^(k+1)`.\n            *   The last time the loop runs is for an integer `k` such that `c^k ≤ n`.\n            *   Therefore, the number of iterations `k` is the largest integer such that `c^k ≤ n`. Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives `k ≤ log_c(n)`.\n            *   This means the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. The number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):** Returning the result is a single operation, which takes O(1) time.\n\n4.  **Combine the Costs to Find Total Complexity:**\n    *   Total Time `T(n) = (Time for Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) * (Time per Iteration) + (Time for Return)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(1) + ⌊log_c(n)⌋ * O(1) + O(1)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(log_c(n))`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Final Expression:** In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is considered a constant factor and can be omitted. This is due to the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `1 / log_b(c)` is a constant for any fixed bases `b` and `c`, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes that basic arithmetic operations take constant time (O(1)). If `n` is an arbitrarily large number that does not fit in a single machine word, the time for division and multiplication would depend on the number of bits in `n` (which is `O(log n)`). In that case, the complexity would be `O((log n)^2)`. However, the standard analysis for such algorithms counts the number of high-level operations, assuming they are elementary.\n*   **Loop Termination:** The key to the analysis is correctly identifying that the controlling variable `q` is reduced by a factor of `c` in each step. This multiplicative reduction is what leads to a logarithmic number of iterations.\n*   **Input Values:** The complexity is a function of the input `n`. The base `c` is treated as a constant. If `c` were also a variable input, the complexity would need to be expressed in terms of both `n` and `c`, as `O(log_c n)`. But typically, for time complexity, `n` is considered the size of the input.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe algorithm's execution time is dominated by the `while` loop. The number of times this loop runs is determined by how many times we can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1. This is the definition of the logarithm. Therefore, the loop runs approximately `log_c(n)` times. Since each loop iteration takes a constant amount of time, the total time complexity is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\nFinal Answer: O(log n)\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
