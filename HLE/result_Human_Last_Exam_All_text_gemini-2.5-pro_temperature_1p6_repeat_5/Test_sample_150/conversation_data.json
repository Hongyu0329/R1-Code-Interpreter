    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided Java program, its correctness, and then designing an optimal C program to determine the efficiency metrics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0. A series of `n` statements are executed. Each statement either increments `x` by 1 (`++`) or decrements `x` by 1 (`--`). The possible statement formats are `X++`, `++X`, `X--`, and `--X`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Java Program:**\n    *   **Initialization:** The code correctly reads the number of statements `t` (equivalent to `n`) and initializes the result `tresult` (equivalent to `x`) to 0. This is correct.\n    *   **Loop:** The `while (t-- > 0)` loop correctly iterates `n` times, processing one statement per iteration.\n    *   **Logic:** The core of the program is inside the loop:\n        ```java\n        String test = inpt.next();\n        if (test.contains(\"++X\")) {\n            tresult++;\n        }\n        if (test.contains(\"--X\")) {\n            tresult--;\n        }\n        ```\n    *   **Flaw Identification:** The method `test.contains(\"++X\")` checks if the substring `\"++X\"` exists within the input string `test`. This will only be true for the input `\"++X\"`. It will be false for the other increment operation, `\"X++\"`. Similarly, `test.contains(\"--X\")` is only true for the input `\"--X\"` and false for `\"X--\"`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The program is **incorrect** because it fails to handle the post-fix operations (`X++` and `X--`). It will give the wrong answer if the input contains any of these statements.\n\n3.  **Design an Optimal C Program:**\n    To satisfy the \"fastest and least memory\" requirement, we need an efficient way to distinguish between increment and decrement operations.\n    *   **Key Observation:** All four possible statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) have a length of 3 characters. The middle character (at index 1) is always `+` for an increment and `-` for a decrement. This allows for a very fast check.\n    *   **Optimal Algorithm:**\n        1. Read the integer `n`.\n        2. Initialize an integer `x = 0`.\n        3. Loop `n` times.\n        4. In each loop, read the statement.\n        5. Check only the character at index 1. If it's `'+'`, increment `x`. Otherwise, it must be `'-'`, so decrement `x`.\n        6. After the loop, print the final value of `x`.\n\n4.  **Calculate `x` (Smallest number of character comparisons for n=100):**\n    *   Using the optimal algorithm described above, for each of the 100 statements, we only need to perform **one** character comparison (e.g., `if (statement[1] == '+')`).\n    *   Total comparisons for 100 statements = `100 * 1 = 100`.\n    *   This is the minimum possible, as each statement must be inspected in some way to determine its effect. Checking a single character is the most efficient inspection.\n    *   Therefore, **x = 100**.\n\n5.  **Calculate `y` (Smallest memory size in Bytes):**\n    *   We need to determine the minimum memory required for the variables in the most memory-efficient C implementation. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n    *   A memory-frugal implementation would use `getchar()` to read input character-by-character, avoiding a larger string buffer.\n    *   The necessary variables are:\n        1.  `int n;` (To store the number of statements): 4 bytes.\n        2.  `int x = 0;` (To store the running total): 4 bytes.\n        3.  `int i;` (The loop counter `for(i=0; i<n; i++)`): 4 bytes.\n        4.  `char op;` (To store the middle character for checking): 1 byte.\n    *   The total memory for these variables is `4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13` bytes. This is less than an approach using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` which would require a 4-byte character array buffer, resulting in `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16` bytes.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest memory size is **13 bytes**.\n    *   Thus, **y = 13**.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   The program is incorrect, so the answer starts with `N`.\n    *   The format is `Nx+y`.\n    *   Substituting our calculated values: `x=100`, `y=13`.\n\nThe final answer is `N100+13`.\n\n***\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctness of Java Code:** The crucial point is understanding that `String.contains()` in Java looks for a substring. `\"++X\"` is not a substring of `\"X++\"`, which is why the original code fails.\n2.  **Efficiency in C:** The key to an efficient solution is not to use string comparison functions like `strcmp`, but to find a single, unique feature that distinguishes the operations. The character at index 1 is that feature.\n3.  **Character Comparisons:** The question specifically asks for character comparisons, not the total number of instructions. The `if (char == '+')` is the single comparison needed per statement.\n4.  **Memory Calculation:** The \"smallest memory size\" is interpreted as the sum of the sizes of the essential variables needed to implement the most frugal version of the algorithm. This requires comparing different input methods (`scanf` vs `getchar`) and accounting for all necessary variables, including loop counters.\n\n<<<N100+13>>>"
