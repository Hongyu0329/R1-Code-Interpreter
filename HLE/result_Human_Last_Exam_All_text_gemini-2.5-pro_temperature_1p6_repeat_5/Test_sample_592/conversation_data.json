    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe user wants to identify the specific city in the United States that the character Tommaso moves to in the 1997 movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Information from the Question**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States.\n*   **Goal:** Find the name of the US city.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Character's Story Arc**\nTommaso is the best friend of the protagonist, Piero. He comes from a wealthy but dysfunctional family and is portrayed as restless and rebellious. His journey is a counterpoint to Piero's life, which is rooted in their working-class neighborhood of Livorno. Towards the end of the film, feeling disillusioned with his life in Italy, Tommaso decides to make a radical change.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Relevant Scene**\nThere is a key scene in the movie where Tommaso announces his departure to Piero. This is a significant moment for both characters, symbolizing the different paths their lives are taking. In this conversation, Tommaso explains his decision to leave Italy and seek a new beginning.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Specific Location Mentioned**\nDuring his conversation with Piero, Tommaso explicitly names his destination. He states that he is moving to the United States to start over. The city he names represents the ultimate escape and the embodiment of the \"American Dream\" for him. That city is New York City.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to distinguish the protagonist, Piero, from his friend Tommaso, as the question is specifically about Tommaso.\n*   The movie is Italian, so consulting plot summaries from Italian sources can often provide more specific details.\n*   The move is a pivotal event in the film's conclusion, marking the end of an era for the friendship between Tommaso and Piero.\n*   The choice of the city is symbolic within the film's narrative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the plot and the specific scene where Tommaso reveals his plans, we can confirm that he explicitly states he is moving to New York City.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
