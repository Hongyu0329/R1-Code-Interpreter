    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question and Definitions**\n\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with\" the generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\), where \\(p/q = 4/7\\). This is not the continued fraction of the real number \\(m_{4/7}\\) itself. Instead, it refers to the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, whose properties of Diophantine approximation are characterized by \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\nThe standard construction for this associated irrational number, let's call it \\(\\xi_{p/q}\\), is as follows:\nIf the simple continued fraction of a rational number \\(p/q\\) is given by \\([a_0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\), then the continued fraction of the associated irrational number \\(\\xi_{p/q}\\) is:\n$$ \\xi_{p/q} = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}, \\overline{a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_0}] $$\nThe non-periodic part (or \"stem\") of \\(\\xi_{p/q}\\) is \\([a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}]\\), and the periodic part is formed by reversing the entire sequence of coefficients of \\(p/q\\).\n\n**2. Compute the Continued Fraction of 4/7**\n\nWe use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the continued fraction for \\(p/q = 4/7\\).\n\n*   **Step a:** \\(4/7\\). The integer part is 0. So, \\(a_0 = 0\\). The remainder is \\(4/7\\).\n*   **Step b:** Take the reciprocal of the remainder: \\(1 / (4/7) = 7/4\\).\n*   **Step c:** \\(7/4 = 1 + 3/4\\). The integer part is 1. So, \\(a_1 = 1\\). The remainder is \\(3/4\\).\n*   **Step d:** Take the reciprocal of the remainder: \\(1 / (3/4) = 4/3\\).\n*   **Step e:** \\(4/3 = 1 + 1/3\\). The integer part is 1. So, \\(a_2 = 1\\). The remainder is \\(1/3\\).\n*   **Step f:** Take the reciprocal of the remainder: \\(1 / (1/3) = 3\\).\n*   **Step g:** \\(3 = 3 + 0\\). The integer part is 3. So, \\(a_3 = 3\\). The algorithm terminates.\n\nThe continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\nThe coefficients are \\((a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3) = (0, 1, 1, 3)\\). Here, \\(n=3\\).\n\n**3. Construct the Symbolic Form of the Associated Continued Fraction**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1:\n$$ \\xi_{4/7} = [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\overline{a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0}] $$\nSubstituting the coefficients we found:\n$$ \\xi_{4/7} = [0; 1, 1, \\overline{3, 1, 1, 0}] $$\n\n**4. Convert the Non-Simple Periodic Part to a Simple Continued Fraction**\n\nThe symbolic expression contains a 0 in the periodic part. A *simple* continued fraction requires all coefficients (except possibly \\(a_0\\)) to be positive integers. The notation \\([\\overline{3, 1, 1, 0}]\\) is a symbolic representation of a quadratic irrational, which we must convert.\n\nLet \\(\\gamma = [\\overline{3, 1, 1, 0}]\\). This notation means that \\(\\gamma\\) is the solution to the equation \\(\\gamma = [3; 1, 1, 0, \\gamma]\\). We can find the value of \\(\\gamma\\) by setting up a quadratic equation. The equation for a purely periodic continued fraction \\(\\gamma = [\\overline{c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_k}]\\) is \\(q_k \\gamma^2 + (q_{k-1} - p_k) \\gamma - p_{k-1} = 0\\), where \\(p_i/q_i\\) are the convergents of \\([c_0; c_1, \\dots, c_k]\\).\n\nFor \\([3, 1, 1, 0]\\):\n*   \\(p_0/q_0 = 3/1\\)\n*   \\(p_1/q_1 = [3;1] = 4/1\\)\n*   \\(p_2/q_2 = [3;1,1] = 7/2\\)\n*   \\(p_3/q_3 = [3;1,1,0] = [3;1,1+1/0]\\) is ill-defined. Using the recurrence: \\(p_3 = 0 \\cdot p_2 + p_1 = 4\\), \\(q_3 = 0 \\cdot q_2 + q_1 = 1\\).\n\nThe quadratic equation for \\(\\gamma\\) is \\(q_3\\gamma^2 + (q_2-p_3)\\gamma - p_2 = 0\\):\n$$ 1\\cdot\\gamma^2 + (2-4)\\gamma - 7 = 0 $$\n$$ \\gamma^2 - 2\\gamma - 7 = 0 $$\nSolving using the quadratic formula \\(\\gamma = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\):\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-7)}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+28}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2} $$\nSince \\(\\gamma\\) must be positive (as its first coefficient is 3), we take the positive root:\n$$ \\gamma = 1 + 2\\sqrt{2} $$\n\nNow, we find the simple continued fraction of \\(\\gamma = 1 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\):\n*   \\(\\alpha_0 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1 + 2.828 = 3.828\\). The integer part is \\(c_0 = 3\\).\n*   \\(\\alpha_1 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_0 - c_0} = \\frac{1}{(1+2\\sqrt{2}) - 3} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}-2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}+2}{(2\\sqrt{2}-2)(2\\sqrt{2}+2)} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}+1)}{8-4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2} \\approx 1.207\\). The integer part is \\(c_1 = 1\\).\n*   \\(\\alpha_2 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_1 - c_1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2} - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}-1} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}+1)}{2-1} = 2\\sqrt{2}+2 \\approx 4.828\\). The integer part is \\(c_2 = 4\\).\n*   \\(\\alpha_3 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_2 - c_2} = \\frac{1}{(2\\sqrt{2}+2) - 4} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}-2} = \\alpha_1\\).\n\nSince \\(\\alpha_3 = \\alpha_1\\), the sequence of coefficients will repeat from \\(c_1\\). The periodic part is \\((1, 4)\\).\nSo, the simple continued fraction for \\(\\gamma\\) is \\([3; \\overline{1, 4}]\\).\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Continued Fraction**\n\nWe substitute the simple form of \\(\\gamma\\) back into the expression for \\(\\xi_{4/7}\\):\n$$ \\xi_{4/7} = [0; 1, 1, \\gamma] = [0; 1, 1, [3; \\overline{1, 4}]] $$\nA key property of continued fractions is that we can concatenate the coefficients:\n$$ \\xi_{4/7} = [0; 1, 1, 3, \\overline{1, 4}] $$\nThis is the final simple continued fraction associated with \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Associated CF vs. CF of the number:** The primary point is understanding that the question asks for the continued fraction of an associated irrational number, not of the Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) itself.\n2.  **Construction Formula:** The formula \\(\\xi_{p/q} = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}, \\overline{a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_0}]\\) is standard for this context.\n3.  **Non-Simple Continued Fractions:** The construction can formally produce an expression with zeros in the periodic part. This is not a simple continued fraction and must be converted. This is the most crucial calculation step.\n4.  **Conversion Process:** The conversion involves finding the numerical value of the periodic part (by solving the corresponding quadratic equation) and then computing the standard, simple continued fraction of that value.\n5.  **Concatenation:** The final step uses the property that \\([a_0; ..., a_k, [b_0; b_1, ...]] = [a_0; ..., a_k, b_0, b_1, ...]\\).\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n*   CF of 4/7: \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\n*   Coefficients: \\((a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3) = (0, 1, 1, 3)\\).\n*   Symbolic associated CF: \\([0; 1, 1, \\overline{3, 1, 1, 0}]\\).\n*   Value of periodic part \\([\\overline{3, 1, 1, 0}]\\) is \\(1 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n*   Simple CF of \\(1 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\) is \\([3; \\overline{1, 4}]\\).\n*   Final Answer: \\([0; 1, 1, 3, \\overline{1, 4}]\\).\n\n>>> \\([0; 1, 1, 3, \\overline{1, 4}]\\)"
