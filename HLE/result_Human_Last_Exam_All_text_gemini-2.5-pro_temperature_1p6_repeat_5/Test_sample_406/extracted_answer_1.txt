The conditions are that (1) the spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces, and (2) the functions F, G, and H are contractive in the sense that they satisfy Lipschitz-type inequalities `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)` a `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂ d_X(x₁, x₂)` a `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_X(x₁, x₂)` for non-negative constants, where the sum of the coefficients that multiply the same distance function across the three inequalities is less than 1. Formally, `max( (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) ) < 1`.
