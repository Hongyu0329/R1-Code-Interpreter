    "An FGH-tripled fixed point theorem provides conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a system of three non-linear equations. Here, we analyze the conditions based on the structure of the given functions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nFirst, we must define what an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is based on the function signatures provided. The user specified:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n*   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z * Y * X → Z` (We assume the second `G` in the prompt was a typo and should be `H`, as is standard for a triplet of functions F, G, H).\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies a system of fixed-point-like equations. The most natural definition given the domains and codomains is:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Careful Point:** The arguments of the functions are specific and must be used as defined. `G` takes two arguments from `Y` and one from `X`. `H` takes one argument from each space in a specific order.\n\n**Step 2: Reformulate as a Single Fixed-Point Problem**\n\nThis system of three equations can be transformed into a single fixed-point problem on a larger space. This allows us to use standard fixed-point theorems.\n\n*   Define a product space `W = X × Y × Z`. An element in this space is a triplet `w = (x, y, z)`.\n*   Define a single operator `T: W → W` that combines the three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   A fixed point of `T` is an element `w = (x, y, z)` such that `T(w) = w`. This is equivalent to `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, which breaks down into the three equations defined in Step 1.\n\n**Careful Point:** By converting the system into a single operator on a product space, we can apply powerful tools like the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. The problem of finding an FGH-tripled fixed point is now the problem of finding a fixed point for `T`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point for a mapping if two conditions are met:\n1.  The space on which the mapping is defined is a **complete metric space**.\n2.  The mapping is a **contraction mapping**.\n\nWe now derive the specific conditions on `X, Y, Z, F, G, H` that satisfy these two requirements for our operator `T` on the space `W`.\n\n**Step 4: The Completeness Condition**\n\nFor `W = X × Y × Z` to be a complete metric space, each of its component spaces must be a complete metric space.\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be the metric spaces for `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n*   We can define a metric on the product space `W`, for instance, the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   The product space `(W, d_W)` is complete if and only if each of the component spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` is complete.\n\n**Condition 1:** **The spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces.**\n\n**Step 5: The Contraction Condition**\n\nThe operator `T` must be a contraction mapping on `W`. This means there must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\nLet's expand this using the sum metric and the definition of `T`:\n`d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))`\n\nTo satisfy this, we impose contractive (Lipschitz) conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H`. Let's assume there exist non-negative constants `αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ` such that for all points in their respective domains:\n1.  `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂ d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The condition for `G` only has two terms because its arguments are `(y, x, y)`. The change in the first and third arguments is measured by `d_Y(y₁, y₂)` and the change in the second argument is measured by `d_X(x₁, x₂)` .\n\nNow, we substitute these inequalities into the main contraction inequality:\n`LHS = d_X(F(...)) + d_Y(G(...)) + d_Z(H(...))`\n`LHS ≤ (α₁ d_X + α₂ d_Y + α₃ d_Z) + (β₁ d_Y + β₂ d_X) + (γ₁ d_Z + γ₂ d_Y + γ₃ d_X)`\n\nGroup the terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n`LHS ≤ (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃) d_X(x₁, x₂) + (α₂ + β₁ + γ₂) d_Y(y₁, y₂) + (α₃ + γ₁) d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we need this sum to be less than or equal to `k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for some `k < 1`. This inequality holds if the coefficient of each `d` term is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, a sufficient condition is:\n`max( (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) ) < 1`\n\nIf we let `k = max( (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) )`, then we have the condition `k < 1`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe conditions to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` for the functions `F: X*Y*Z→X`, `G: Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H: Z*Y*X→Z` are derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem and can be summarized as follows:\n\n**1. Space Conditions:**\n*   `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty, complete metric spaces.\n\n**2. Function Contractive Conditions:**\n*   There must exist non-negative constants `(α₁, α₂, α₃)`, `(β₁, β₂)` and `(γ₁, γ₂, γ₃)` such that the following Lipschitz-type inequalities hold for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂ d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n*   These constants must satisfy the global contraction condition:\n    `max( (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) ) < 1`\n\nUnder these conditions, there exists a unique triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`.\n\n<<<The conditions are that (1) the spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces, and (2) the functions F, G, and H are contractive in the sense that they satisfy Lipschitz-type inequalities `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`, `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂ d_X(x₁, x₂)`, and `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁ d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_X(x₁, x₂)` for non-negative constants, where the sum of the coefficients that multiply the same distance function across the three inequalities is less than 1. Formally, `max( (α₁ + β₂ + γ₃), (α₂ + β₁ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₁) ) < 1`.>>>"
