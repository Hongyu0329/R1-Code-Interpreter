    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key identifying detail is a very specific feeling expressed by this character: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This requires knowledge of the characters and key dialogue from the film.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Roles**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The main protagonist. The film begins with him at his father's dacha on Earth, surrounded by nature, including the sounds of rain and rustling leaves. He clearly has a deep connection to Earth and misses it, but the specific emotion of *shame* linked to this feeling needs to be pinpointed. His primary emotional struggle is with the memory of his wife, Hari.\n*   **B. Hari:** A \"guest\" created by the Solaris ocean from Kris's memories. As she is not human and has never truly been on Earth, she cannot miss something she has never experienced in a primary sense. Her experiences of Earth are filtered through Kris.\n*   **C. Snaut:** One of the surviving scientists on the station. He is portrayed as cynical, weary, and highly philosophical. He often engages Kris in long monologues about humanity, science, and the purpose of their mission. This kind of poignant, reflective statement aligns well with his character.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** The other scientist. He is cold, rational, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of the Solaris phenomenon. He is generally devoid of poetic or emotional reflections and is more focused on objective study and control. It is highly unlikely he would make such a sentimental statement.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A friend of Kris who was on the station but is already deceased when Kris arrives. He appears only in a pre-recorded video message. His message is one of despair and a direct warning about the strange occurrences, not a philosophical lament about missing Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Specific Dialogue in the Film**\nThe line in question comes during a philosophical conversation in the station's library between Kris and one of the other scientists. During this discussion, the scientist reflects on the futility and hubris of humanity's search for contact with other worlds, arguing that humans are really just looking for a mirror of themselves and are not prepared for true \"contact.\" He expresses a deep-seated disconnect from Earth and a sense of shame about having lost touch with simple, fundamental human experiences.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Speaker**\nThe character who delivers these philosophical monologues is Dr. Snaut. He tells Kris, \"We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror.\" It is within this context of critiquing humanity's cosmic ambitions that he expresses this personal, profound sense of loss and shame for being part of an endeavor that has alienated them from basic earthly sensations like the rustling of leaves. The statement perfectly encapsulates his world-weary and deeply humanistic, yet cynical, perspective.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the analysis of the characters and the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
