    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Principles: Large Deviations and Statistical Mechanics**\n*   **The System:** We consider a gas of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons, meaning they are indistinguishable particles that follow Bose-Einstein statistics. A critical property of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (like in a blackbody cavity) is that the number of photons is not conserved. This implies that their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Large Deviation Theorems (Boltzmann-Sanov/Cramer-Chernoff):** These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical basis for the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics. They state that for a large system, the probability of observing a macroscopic state (e.g., a specific distribution of energy) is overwhelmingly dominated by the most probable macrostate. Any significant deviation from this state is exponentially unlikely.\n*   **Equilibrium as the Most Probable State:** The equilibrium state of a system is its most probable macroscopic state. According to the large deviation principle (and Boltzmann's insight), this corresponds to the macrostate that can be realized by the largest number of microscopic arrangements. Maximizing this number of arrangements (or its logarithm) is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy.\n*   **Methodology:** We will find the equilibrium state by maximizing the entropy of the photon gas, subject to the constraint that its total average energy is fixed. This maximization procedure, justified by the large deviation theorems, will yield the equilibrium distribution of photons among energy levels, from which we can calculate the mean energy and entropy.\n\n**2. Defining Entropy for a Bose Gas**\n*   For distinguishable particles, the entropy is related to the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of particles over states. However, for indistinguishable bosons, we must count the microstates differently.\n*   The system can be viewed as a collection of independent energy modes (or oscillators), indexed by $j$, each with energy $\\epsilon_j$. The state of the system is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_j\\}$, where $n_j$ is the number of photons in mode $j$.\n*   The entropy of a single bosonic mode $j$, when it has an average occupation number of $\\langle n_j \\rangle$, can be derived from combinatorial arguments (counting microstates) or from maximizing the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of $n_j$. The result is:\n    $S_j = k_B \\left[ (1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle \\right]$\n*   Since the modes are independent, the total entropy of the system is the sum of the entropies of each mode:\n    $S = \\sum_j S_j = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle \\right]$\n\n**3. Constrained Maximization to Find Equilibrium**\n*   **Constraint:** The system is held at a fixed average total energy, $U$. This is expressed as a constraint on the average occupation numbers:\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_j \\langle n_j \\rangle \\epsilon_j = U$\n*   **Lagrange Multipliers:** We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the entropy $S$ subject to the energy constraint. We construct the Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$:\n    $\\mathcal{L} = S - k_B \\beta \\left( \\sum_j \\langle n_j \\rangle \\epsilon_j - U \\right)$\n    where $k_B\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier. We will later identify $\\beta$ with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n*   **Maximization:** To find the maximum, we differentiate $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ and set the result to zero:\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\langle n_j \\rangle} = \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\langle n_j \\rangle} - k_B \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n*   **Derivative of Entropy:** First, we calculate the derivative of the single-mode entropy $S_j$ with respect to its average occupation number $\\langle n_j \\rangle$:\n    $\\frac{\\partial S_j}{\\partial \\langle n_j \\rangle} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\langle n_j \\rangle} \\left( k_B \\left[ (1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle \\right] \\right)$\n    $= k_B \\left( \\left[ \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) + 1 \\right] - \\left[ \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle + 1 \\right] \\right)$\n    $= k_B \\left( \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle \\right) = k_B \\ln \\left( \\frac{1+\\langle n_j \\rangle}{\\langle n_j \\rangle} \\right)$\n*   **Solving for the Occupation Number:** Substituting this back into the maximization condition:\n    $k_B \\ln \\left( \\frac{1+\\langle n_j \\rangle}{\\langle n_j \\rangle} \\right) - k_B \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n    $\\ln \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{\\langle n_j \\rangle} \\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n    $1 + \\frac{1}{\\langle n_j \\rangle} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n    $\\frac{1}{\\langle n_j \\rangle} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1$\n    This gives the equilibrium mean occupation number for mode $j$:\n    $\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n    This is the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for particles with zero chemical potential.\n\n**4. Final Equilibrium Values**\nWith the equilibrium distribution determined, we can now write down the expressions for the equilibrium mean energy and entropy.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):** The total mean energy is the sum of the energies of each mode, weighted by their equilibrium occupation number.\n    $E = \\sum_j \\langle n_j \\rangle \\epsilon_j = \\sum_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n    where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. This expression is the foundation of Planck's theory of blackbody radiation.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):** The equilibrium entropy is found by substituting the equilibrium value of $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ back into the general formula for the entropy of a Bose gas.\n    $S = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle \\right]$\n    where $\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$.\n\nThese two expressions represent the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas, derived from the fundamental statistical principle of entropy maximization, which is formally justified by large deviation theorems.\n\n***\n\n<<<The equilibrium values are functions of the temperature (via $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$) and the energy spectrum $\\{\\epsilon_j\\}$ of the system.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\nThe mean energy is the sum of the energies of each mode multiplied by the average number of photons in that mode:\n$E = \\sum_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nThe entropy is the sum of the entropies of each independent energy mode:\n$S = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle \\right]$\nwhere the equilibrium mean occupation number $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n$\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$>>>"
