The equilibrium values are functions of the temperature (via $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$) and the energy spectrum $\{\epsilon_j\}$ of the system.

**Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**
The mean energy is the sum of the energies of each mode multiplied by the average number of photons in that mode:
$E = \sum_j \frac{\epsilon_j}{e^{\beta \epsilon_j} - 1}$

**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**
The entropy is the sum of the entropies of each independent energy mode:
$S = k_B \sum_j \left[ (1+\langle n_j \rangle) \ln(1+\langle n_j \rangle) - \langle n_j \rangle \ln \langle n_j \rangle \right]$
where the equilibrium mean occupation number $\langle n_j \rangle$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution:
$\langle n_j \rangle = \frac{1}{e^{\beta \epsilon_j} - 1}$
