    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reagents**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) is crucial.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Solvent:** tert-Butyl alcohol (tBuOH). This is a polar solvent that is the conjugate acid of the base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type**\n    *   The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. Substitution reactions (SN2/SN1) are disfavored. SN2 is hindered by the bulky base and the secondary carbon center. E2 is favored over E1 by the use of a strong base.\n\n3.  **Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n    *   The E2 mechanism is a concerted, one-step process that requires a specific spatial arrangement of the leaving group and the proton being removed. They must be **anti-periplanar**.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar requirement means the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton (Hydrogen) must both be in **axial** positions on adjacent carbons. This is known as a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n4.  **Determine the Conformation of the Starting Material**\n    *   First, we determine the relative stereochemistry of the substituents from the name (1S,2R). For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, if the stereocenters are (R,S) or (S,R), the substituents are **trans** to each other. If they are (R,R) or (S,S), they are *cis*.\n    *   Therefore, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *trans* isomer.\n    *   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one where both substituents are equatorial (diequatorial) and one where both are axial (diaxial).\n    *   The diequatorial conformer is much more stable and is the predominant conformer at equilibrium.\n    *   However, for the E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (Br) **must be axial**. This means the reaction must proceed through the less stable **diaxial** conformer.\n\n5.  **Identify the Reactive Conformer and Analyze Available Protons**\n    *   Let's draw the reactive, diaxial conformer of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. In this conformer, the bromine atom is axial on C1, and the methyl group is axial on C2.\n    *   The base needs to remove a proton that is *anti-periplanar* (trans-diaxial) to the axial bromine atom. We must look at the adjacent carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group (-CH₃) is in the axial position. Therefore, the hydrogen atom on C2 is in the **equatorial** position. There is no axial hydrogen on C2.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine on C1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because there is no axial proton on C2, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 (the more substituted Zaitsev product) is **stereochemically impossible**. The reaction is under stereoelectronic control.\n\n6.  **Predict the Product**\n    *   The only available proton for the E2 reaction is the axial proton on C6.\n    *   The base (tert-butoxide) will abstract this accessible axial proton from C6, and the bromine will leave from C1 simultaneously.\n    *   This results in the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 remains untouched.\n\n7.  **Name the Product**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group.\n    *   The double bond is formed between the original C1 and C6. The methyl group is on the original C2.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature for alkenes, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2). Following this rule, the methyl group is located on carbon 3.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n### **Summary of Careful Points**\n*   The reaction is an E2 elimination, not a substitution.\n*   The E2 reaction requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of H and Br.\n*   The (1S,2R) stereochemistry signifies a *trans* relationship between Br and CH₃.\n*   The reaction must proceed through the unstable diaxial conformer, not the stable diequatorial one.\n*   In the required diaxial conformer, there is NO axial proton on C2, making Zaitsev elimination impossible.\n*   The only possible product is the Hofmann product, formed by removing the axial proton from C6.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
