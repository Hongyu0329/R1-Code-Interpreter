    "For a supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with *n* replicas, the target manifold is given by the supercoset space SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassmann variables are the coordinates for the bosonic sector of this space.\n\nThe bosonic part of the supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) is the Lie group Sp(2n, R) × O(2n).\nThe bosonic part of the supergroup U(n|n) is U(n) × U(n).\n\nTherefore, the bosonic sector of the target manifold is the coset space (Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)) / (U(n) × U(n)). The number of non-Grassmann variables is the dimension of this coset space.\n\nTo find the dimension, we calculate the dimensions of the respective Lie groups for the case of two replicas, where n=2:\n\n*   The dimension of the special symplectic group Sp(2n, R) is given by the formula n(2n + 1). For n=2, the dimension of Sp(4, R) is 2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the orthogonal group O(N) is given by N(N - 1)/2. For n=2, we have O(4), so its dimension is 4 * (4 - 1)/2 = 6.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². For n=2, the dimension of U(2) is 2² = 4.\n\nThe dimension of the numerator group, Sp(4, R) × O(4), is the sum of their individual dimensions: 10 + 6 = 16.\nThe dimension of the denominator group, U(2) × U(2), is the sum of their dimensions: 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe dimension of the coset space, and thus the number of non-Grassmann variables, is the difference between the dimension of the numerator and the denominator: 16 - 8 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
