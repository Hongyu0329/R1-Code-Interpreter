In scalar field theory, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, for d < 4 through an epsilon expansion, where ε = 4 - d. To the leading order in ε, the relationship is given by the formula α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ε, where n is the number of components of the scalar field. This demonstrates a linear dependence on the deviation from the upper critical dimension. For the Ising model (n=1), this simplifies to α ≈ ε/6. A more precise scaling is given by the second-order expansion: α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ε - (n+2)(n(n+20)+4(n-7)) / (8(n+8)³) * ε².
