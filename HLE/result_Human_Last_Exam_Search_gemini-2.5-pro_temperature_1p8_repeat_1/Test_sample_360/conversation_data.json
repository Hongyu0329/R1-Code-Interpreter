    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed which results in two diastereoisomers.\n\nThe ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, acts as a bridging ligand, capable of binding to two ruthenium centers. The starting ruthenium complex, *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), is a chiral molecule, existing in either a Δ (delta) or Λ (lambda) configuration.\n\nThe reaction involves two of these chiral ruthenium complexes binding to the bridging ligand. This results in the formation of a dinuclear ruthenium complex. The combination of the chiral ruthenium centers leads to the creation of two diastereoisomers:\n\n*   **A meso form:** This isomer has a Δ configuration at one ruthenium center and a Λ configuration at the other (Δ/Λ). It possesses a center of inversion.\n*   **A racemic form (rac):** This is a mixture of two enantiomers, one with both ruthenium centers in the Δ configuration (Δ/Δ) and the other with both in the Λ configuration (Λ/Λ). This form has a two-fold rotation axis.\n\nThese two diastereoisomers, the meso and the racemic pair, have been successfully synthesized and separated, and they were found to form in a 2:1 ratio.\n\n<<<2>>>"
