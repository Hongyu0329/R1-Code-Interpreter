    "To protect against a brute-force attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, the length of a symmetric key must be significantly longer than what is required for classical computers. The primary threat to symmetric key encryption from quantum computing is Grover's algorithm, which can quadratically speed up the search for the correct key. This effectively halves the security of the key.\n\nFor a symmetric key to be considered secure, it is widely recommended that it provides at least 128 bits of security. Against a classical computer, a 128-bit key, such as that used in AES-128, is sufficient. However, a quantum computer running Grover's algorithm would reduce the effective security of a 128-bit key to only 64 bits, which is not considered secure.\n\nTo counteract the advantage provided by Grover's algorithm and achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, it is necessary to double the key length. Therefore, a symmetric key with a length of at least 256 bits is required. This would provide an effective security of 128 bits against a quantum attack, which is generally considered a robust level of security.\n\nSome experts suggest that for very high-security, long-term applications, an even higher security level of 256 bits might be desirable in the post-quantum era. To achieve this, a 512-bit symmetric key would be needed. However, for the standard minimum level of security, 256 bits is the accepted length.\n\n<<<A>>>"
