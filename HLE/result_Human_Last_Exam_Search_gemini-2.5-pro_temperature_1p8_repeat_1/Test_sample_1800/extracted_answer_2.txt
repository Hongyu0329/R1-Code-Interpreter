The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles varies depending on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a nickel content in the range of 5 to 12.5 wt% is effective, with performance being influenced by the presence of dopants. For water splitting, a higher nickel content, specifically a 3:1 Ni/Ce atomic ratio, has shown significant promise for the overall reaction and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), while a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5 has been identified as optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).
