    "Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles have emerged as highly effective catalysts for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting, with their catalytic performance being significantly influenced by the Ni/Ce ratio. The ideal ratio to maximize performance is not a single value but rather falls within a range that depends on the specific reaction and the presence of other materials.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, various Ni/Ce ratios have demonstrated high catalytic activity. Research indicates that Ni-Ceria catalysts with a nickel content ranging from **5 to 12.5 wt%** exhibit strong performance in converting CO. Specifically, catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni showed nearly identical and high CO conversion rates of 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively, at 400°C.\n\nFurther studies have shown that the introduction of other elements can modify the ideal Ni loading. For instance, a catalyst with a composition of **Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂** displayed the highest catalytic activity among a series of mixed oxide catalysts. Another study revealed that the addition of a small amount of nickel, specifically **5 at. % Ni** to Lanthanum-doped Ceria (Ce(La)Oₓ), significantly enhances the WGS reaction activity. This suggests that a lower nickel content can be highly effective, especially when the ceria support is modified. Doping with elements like Samarium (Sm) and Rhenium (Re) can also boost the performance of a **4 wt% Ni** on Ceria catalyst.\n\nThe key takeaway for the WGS reaction is that while a broad range of Ni concentrations can be effective, the optimal ratio often depends on the overall composition of the catalyst, including the presence of promoters or dopants.\n\n### Water Splitting\n\nIn the context of water splitting, which involves two half-reactions—the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)—different Ni/Ce ratios have been identified as optimal.\n\nFor the overall water splitting process, a computational study has suggested that a **3Ni/1Ce atomic ratio** provides a favorable adsorption energy for the reaction. This indicates a high nickel content is beneficial.\n\nFocusing on the specific half-reactions:\n*   For the **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)**, experimental work with Ni₃N-CeO₂ nanoparticles found that a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (or a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5)** resulted in the best performance.\n*   For the **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)**, another critical step in water splitting, catalysts with **Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ (a 3:1 Ni to Ce atomic ratio) and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ (a 1:1 Ni to Ce atomic ratio)** have shown superior performance due to their larger electrochemically active surface areas.\n\nIn summary, for water splitting applications, higher nickel concentrations, such as a **3:1 Ni/Ce ratio**, appear to be particularly promising, although a lower ratio has been found to be optimal for the HER specifically.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles varies depending on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a nickel content in the range of 5 to 12.5 wt% is effective, with performance being influenced by the presence of dopants. For water splitting, a higher nickel content, specifically a 3:1 Ni/Ce atomic ratio, has shown significant promise for the overall reaction and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), while a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5 has been identified as optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).>>>"
