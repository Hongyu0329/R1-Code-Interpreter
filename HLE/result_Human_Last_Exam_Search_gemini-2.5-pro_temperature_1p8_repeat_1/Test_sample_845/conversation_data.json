    "The value between heartbeats used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is most commonly called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis value represents the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats and is typically measured in milliseconds (ms). While IBI is a general term, other specific names are also used depending on the measurement method:\n\n*   **R-R Interval**: When HRV is measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), the value is often called the R-R interval. This refers to the time between successive R-waves, which are the prominent peaks in an ECG signal.\n*   **NN Interval**: This stands for \"normal-to-normal\" interval and refers to the time between consecutive normal heartbeats, after any irregular beats or artifacts in the data have been removed.\n*   **Beat-to-beat interval**: This is a more descriptive term that is also frequently used to refer to the same measurement.\n\nEssentially, all these terms describe the same fundamental physiological phenomenon: the variation in time between successive heartbeats, which is the basis for calculating HRV.\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
