The overlap integral \(S\) for two 2s orbitals in the \(\mathrm{H}_2^+\) ion, expressed in terms of the internuclear distance \(R\) and the effective nuclear charge \(\zeta\), is given by the following analytical expression:
\[ S(2s, 2s) = e^{-p} \left(1 + p + \frac{4p^2}{3} + \frac{p^3}{3} + \frac{p^4}{15}\right) \]
where \( p = \frac{\zeta R}{2} \).
