    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube when using the CFOP method, a solver must see a minimum of **five** non-top-facing stickers. This is based on the widely practiced technique of \"2-sided PLL recognition\".\n\nDuring the PLL step, the top face is already oriented, meaning all stickers on that face are the correct color. To identify which of the 21 possible PLL cases is present, a solver needs to observe the permutation of the corner and edge pieces in the last layer. This can be achieved by looking at the sticker patterns on two adjacent side faces of the top layer.\n\nThese two adjacent faces have a total of six non-top-facing stickers: two on each of the three corner pieces and one on each of the two edge pieces visible from that two-sided view. However, not all six stickers are necessary for a unique identification. The Speedsolving.com wiki, a reputable resource in the speedcubing community, states that it is possible to recognize any PLL case by looking at only five stickers. This is because the identity and orientation of a corner piece can be determined by just two of its three stickers (since the top-facing sticker is already known). Therefore, observing two stickers on one corner, one on the adjacent corner on the same face, and the stickers of the two visible edge pieces provides enough information to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases.\n\nAdvanced speedcubers utilize various recognition cues within these five stickers, such as \"headlights\" (a pair of same-colored corner stickers on one face), \"blocks\" (a 2x1 or 3x1 formation of solved pieces), and \"checker patterns\". These patterns allow for the quick and accurate identification of the specific PLL case without needing to view all four sides of the last layer, which in turn saves valuable time during a solve.\n\n<<<5>>>"
