    "Let C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X its 15th symmetric power, denoted as C^(15). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, also known as the Picard number ρ(X), depends on the nature of the curve C.\n\nThe 15th symmetric power X = C^(15) is the variety of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. For a curve C of genus g, when the degree d of the symmetric power is sufficiently large (specifically, for d ≥ 2g - 1), the Abel-Jacobi map exhibits C^(d) as a projective bundle over the Jacobian variety J(C) of the curve. In this case, with g=3 and d=15, the condition 15 ≥ 2(3) - 1 = 5 is satisfied. This means X is a P^(15-3) = P^12 fibration over J(C).\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of such a projective bundle is given by the formula:\nρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1\nwhere ρ(J(C)) is the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X occurs when C is a *generic* curve. For a generic curve of genus g, its Jacobian J(C) has the minimum possible Picard number, which corresponds to having only trivial endomorphisms (the integers, **Z**). In this case, ρ(J(C)) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is achieved when C is a special type of curve whose Jacobian J(C) has the maximum possible Picard number. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g, such as J(C), is bounded by the Hodge number h¹¹(J(C)), which is equal to g². For a genus 3 curve, this maximum is:\nρ_max(J(C)) ≤ h¹¹(J(C)) = 3² = 9.\n\nThis maximum rank is attained for curves whose Jacobians are of CM-type (Complex Multiplication), meaning they are isogenous to a product of elliptic curves with complex multiplication. Such curves are said to have maximal correspondences or have a ρ-maximal Jacobian. An example of a genus 3 curve with a ρ-maximal Jacobian is the Fermat quartic curve (x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0), whose Jacobian is isogenous to the product of three elliptic curves with CM by **Z**[i]. Thus, the maximum possible value for ρ(J(C)) is 9.\n\nConsequently, the largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nρ_max(X) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
