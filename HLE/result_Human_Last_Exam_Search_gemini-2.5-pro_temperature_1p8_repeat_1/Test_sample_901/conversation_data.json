    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThis reaction is an E2 elimination, which has a strict stereochemical requirement. For the elimination to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromide) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon must be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) arrangement.\n\nThe starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *trans* isomer. In its most stable chair conformation, both the bulky bromine atom and the methyl group would occupy equatorial positions to minimize steric strain. However, for the E2 reaction to proceed, the molecule must adopt a less stable conformation where the bromine is in an axial position.\n\nWhen the bromine on carbon 1 is axial, the methyl group on carbon 2 is also forced into an axial position. In this conformation, we must look for adjacent hydrogens that are also axial:\n*   **On carbon 2:** The methyl group is axial, which means the hydrogen on carbon 2 is equatorial. There is no axial hydrogen on this carbon to eliminate. Therefore, the formation of 1-methylcyclohexene (the more substituted Zaitsev product) is not possible via the E2 mechanism.\n*   **On carbon 6:** This carbon has an axial hydrogen which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n\nBecause the only available anti-periplanar hydrogen is on carbon 6, the bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, will abstract this proton, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 6. This yields 3-methylcyclohexene, which is the less substituted, or \"anti-Zaitsev,\" product. In this case, the stereochemical requirements of the reaction dictate the regiochemical outcome, overriding Zaitsev's rule.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
