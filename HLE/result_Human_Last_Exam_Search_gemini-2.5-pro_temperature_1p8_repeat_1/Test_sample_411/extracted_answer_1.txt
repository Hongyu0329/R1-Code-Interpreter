(a) Diversity Order:**
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_a$ is **1**.
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_b$ is **1**.
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_c$ is **2**.

**(b) Maximum Directivity:**
Code **$\mathbf{S}_c$** provides the best performance. It achieves the maximum possible diversity order of 2 for this system, while codes $\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\mathbf{S}_b$ only achieve a diversity order of 1. In this context, "maximum directivity" is interpreted as achieving the best performance in terms of diversity gain.
