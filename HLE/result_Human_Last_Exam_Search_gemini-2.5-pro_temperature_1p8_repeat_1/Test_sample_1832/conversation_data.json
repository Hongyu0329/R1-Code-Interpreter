    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. For this metric, there are 9 non-zero Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols, taking into account the symmetry in the lower indices ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$), are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{tr}^t$ (and by symmetry $\\Gamma_{rt}^t$)\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta$ (and by symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta$)\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi$ (and by symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi$)\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi$ (and by symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi$)\n\nThese constitute a total of nine distinct non-zero symbols.\n\n<<<9>>>"
