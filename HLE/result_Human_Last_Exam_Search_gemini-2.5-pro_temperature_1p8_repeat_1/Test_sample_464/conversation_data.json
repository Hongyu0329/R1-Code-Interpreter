    "Yes, if $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Schwartz class function such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$, it does follow that $f$ is the zero function.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n### 1. The Fourier Transform on Schwartz Space\nThe problem is best addressed using the Fourier transform. A function $f(x)$ is in the Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, if it is infinitely differentiable and all its derivatives decay faster than any inverse polynomial power.\n\nA key property of the Schwartz space is that the Fourier transform is an automorphism on it, meaning it maps the Schwartz space to itself and is invertible. The Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ of a function $f(x)$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx\n$$\n\n### 2. Relating Moments to the Fourier Transform\nThe moments of the function $f(x)$ are given by the condition $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. We can relate these moments to the derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin.\n\nLet's compute the $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx\n$$\nSince $f$ is a Schwartz function, we can differentiate under the integral sign:\n$$\n= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{\\partial^k}{\\partial\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx\n$$\nNow, evaluating this derivative at $\\xi = 0$:\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\left. \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} \\right|_{\\xi=0} = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx\n$$\nGiven the condition that all moments of $f$ are zero, we have:\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\n\n### 3. Analyticity and the Taylor Series\nThe Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is not only in the Schwartz space but is also an analytic function. This means it can be represented by its Taylor series in a neighborhood of any point. Let's consider the Taylor series expansion of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi = 0$:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k\n$$\nFrom the previous step, we know that all coefficients $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)$ are zero. This implies that the Taylor series is identically zero. Because $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is analytic, if its Taylor series is zero in a neighborhood of the origin, the function itself must be zero everywhere. Thus, we conclude that:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\n### 4. Conclusion from the Inverse Fourier Transform\nThe Fourier transform is a one-to-one mapping on the Schwartz space. This means that if the Fourier transform of a function is zero, the function itself must be zero. This can be seen explicitly by applying the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$\nf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = 0\n$$\nTherefore, $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\n**Note:** The condition that the function belongs to the Schwartz class is crucial. There exist non-zero functions in other spaces (for instance, certain $L^1$ functions) that have all moments equal to zero.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
