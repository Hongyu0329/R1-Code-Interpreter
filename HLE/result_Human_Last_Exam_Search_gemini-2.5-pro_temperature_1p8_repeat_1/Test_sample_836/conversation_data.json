    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, G(r,t), is commonly known in the nuclear criticality community and the broader physics community as the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted S(q,ω) or S(k,ω).\n\nThe pair correlation function describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at a time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform provides information in terms of momentum transfer (**q** or **k**) and energy transfer (ω).\n\nThis relationship is foundational in the field of neutron scattering, a key experimental technique for obtaining data used in nuclear criticality safety analysis. The measured scattering data is directly related to the dynamic structure factor. In the context of nuclear data libraries, such as ENDF/B-VII.1, the term \"thermal scattering law,\" often denoted as S(α,β), is used, which is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor.\n\nThe dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity used in generating the necessary data for thermal neutron scattering in materials, which is then utilized in computational codes for nuclear criticality safety assessments.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
