    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern and then analyze the residues at the core positions, which are the primary determinants of oligomerization.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nA coiled-coil sequence is characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeat, commonly denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The positions `a` and `d` are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues, which form the core of the structure through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence to find this pattern:\n`GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nThe hydrophobic amino acids in this sequence are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W). A repeating pattern can be observed. We can test different \"frames\" for the heptad repeat to see which one places the most hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's test the frame that starts the heptad `a` position with the third residue, 'I':\n*   **Sequence**: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   **Positions**: `g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f`\n*   **Residues at 'a'**: I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **Residues at 'd'**: S, S, S, S (Serine)\n\nThis frame places a hydrophobic residue (I) consistently at the 'a' position but a polar residue (S) at the 'd' position. While possible, this is not a typical arrangement for a stable coiled-coil.\n\nLet's test the frame that starts the heptad `a` position with the fourth residue, 'A':\n*   **Sequence**: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   **Positions**: `f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e`\n*   **Residues at 'a'**: A, A, W, A (Alanine, Tryptophan)\n*   **Residues at 'd'**: L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n\nThis assignment is chemically much more favorable. It places hydrophobic residues at all `a` positions (Alanine and the very hydrophobic Tryptophan) and at all `d` positions (Leucine). This `(a,d)` pattern of `(A/W, L)` strongly suggests a canonical coiled-coil structure.\n\n### 2. Determining Oligomeric State from Core Residues\n\nThe specific amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions are critical for determining the number of helices in the coil (the oligomeric state).\n\n*   The majority of the core is defined by **Alanine at the 'a' position** and **Leucine at the 'd' position**. This combination is permissive for several oligomeric states but is commonly found in dimers.\n*   The most informative feature in this sequence is the presence of a **Tryptophan (W) at an 'a' position** (`...EIAWSLK...`). Tryptophan has a very large and bulky side chain.\n*   Studies investigating the role of amino acids at the 'a' position have shown that placing a bulky residue like Tryptophan in this position favors the formation of a **dimer (a two-stranded coil)**. The reasoning is based on packing efficiency; the less-constrained interface of a dimer can more easily accommodate the bulky Trp side chain. In contrast, packing this large residue into the more crowded core of a trimer or tetramer would create unfavorable steric clashes or empty space (cavities).\n\nTherefore, based on the principle of efficient knobs-into-holes packing, the presence of Tryptophan at the 'a' position strongly indicates that the sequence will form a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
