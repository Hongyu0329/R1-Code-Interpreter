    "To find the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we first need to determine the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nStep 1: Factor the polynomial.\nWe can try to find common factors in the terms of the polynomial:\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nThis reveals a common factor of $(x^2-2)$, so we can write:\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Let's denote them by $K_g$ and $K_h$, respectively.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Galois group of each factor.\nThe polynomial $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe polynomial $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=3$ (since 3 does not divide the leading coefficient 1, 3 divides -9 and 3, and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3).\n\nTo find the Galois group of $g(x)$, we analyze its roots. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt{9/5}$.\nLet's evaluate $g(x)$ at these critical points:\n-   At $x_1 = \\sqrt{9/5}$, $g(x_1) = x_1^5 - 9x_1 + 3 = x_1(x_1^4 - 9) + 3 = \\sqrt{9/5}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = -\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt{9/5} + 3$. Since $\\sqrt{9/5} \\approx \\sqrt{1.8} > 1$, and $36/5 = 7.2$, this value is negative.\n-   At $x_2 = -\\sqrt{9/5}$, $g(x_2) = (-x_1)^5 - 9(-x_1) + 3 = -x_1^5 + 9x_1 + 3 = \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt{9/5} + 3$, which is positive.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots. As $g(x)$ is a quintic polynomial, the other two roots must be a complex conjugate pair.\nA theorem in Galois theory states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly $p-2$ real roots, its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, and there are $5-2=3$ real roots, so the Galois group of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$. Thus, $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) = S_5$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the Galois group of the compositum $K_g K_h$. If $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$, then $G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe intersection of the fields is $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This intersection can be either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. It is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\sqrt{2} \\in K_g$. The splitting field $K_g$ of the quintic $g(x)$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_g})$, where $D_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nThe discriminant of a polynomial of the form $x^n + px + q$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n q^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}p^n)$.\nFor $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$, we have $n=5, p=-9, q=3$.\n$D_g = (-1)^{10} (5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14,863,419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14,863,419})$. For $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ to be this subfield, we would need $-14,863,419 = 2 \\cdot r^2$ for some rational number $r$. This is not true as the left side is negative. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\not\\subset K_g$, and the intersection is $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G \\cong S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The order of this group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |\\mathbb{Z}_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\nStep 4: Find the possible degrees of normal subfields.\nBy the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to the normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The normal subgroups of the direct product $S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ are:\n1.  Products of normal subgroups from each factor:\n    *   $H_1 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_1| = 60$. The index is $[G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_2 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_2| = 120$. The index is $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. $|H_3| = 2$. The index is $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. $|H_4| = 120$. The index is $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  \"Diagonal\" subgroups, which arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of the factors. Let $\\phi: S_5/N_1 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2/N_2$ be an isomorphism, where $N_1 \\unlhd S_5$ and $N_2 \\unlhd \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The only non-trivial possibility is an isomorphism between $S_5/A_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2/\\{e\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This gives rise to the normal subgroup:\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(g, h) \\in S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\mid \\phi(gA_5) = h \\}$. Let $\\phi$ be the natural isomorphism mapping the sign of the permutation to the corresponding element in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. $|H_5|=|S_5| = 120$. The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe possible indices for proper non-trivial normal subgroups are 2, 4, and 120. These are the possible degrees of the normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.>>>"
