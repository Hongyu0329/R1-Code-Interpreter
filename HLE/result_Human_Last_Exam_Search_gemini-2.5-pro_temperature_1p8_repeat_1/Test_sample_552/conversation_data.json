    "### No Lectures Cited in Einstein's 1905 Brownian Motion Paper; He Referenced His Own Earlier Work\n\nIn his seminal 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures.\n\nInstead, the paper contains a citation to his own previous work, a scientific article published in 1903 in the same journal, *Annalen der Physik*. The cited work is titled \"Eine Theorie der Grundlagen der Thermodynamik\" (\"A Theory of the Foundations of Thermodynamics\"). An English translation of Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion explicitly includes a footnote referencing this 1903 paper.\n\nThe 1905 paper on Brownian motion is notable for its sparse referencing of contemporary literature. Scholarly sources and analyses of the paper confirm that the primary, and likely sole, citation is to Einstein's own earlier publication. There is no record of him referencing any lectures or the works of other scientists in this particular paper. He did, however, allude to being aware of the phenomenon of Brownian motion as observed by physiologists but found the available data imprecise."
