The initial biochemical reaction is the non-covalent binding of an anticonvulsant drug, or its metabolite, to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein, particularly alleles like HLA-B*15:02. This drug-HLA complex is then presented to T-cell receptors of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, triggering a widespread immune cascade that results in the release of granulysin and subsequently causes extensive keratinocyte apoptosis, leading to skin blistering.
