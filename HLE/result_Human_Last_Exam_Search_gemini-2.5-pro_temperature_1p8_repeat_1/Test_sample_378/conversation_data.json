    "Based on available information, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan did not publicly identify himself as \"Azikiwe\" in a specific year, as \"Azikiwe\" is part of his birth name.\n\nNumerous sources and official records consistently refer to him by his full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. There is no evidence to suggest that \"Azikiwe\" was a name he adopted at a later stage in his life.\n\nOne account suggests that his paternal grandmother gave him the name \"Azikiwe,\" hoping he would follow in the footsteps of the renowned Nnamdi Azikiwe, which indicates the name has been part of his identity since childhood. While the origin of the name was questioned in an opinion piece during his political career, suggesting it might have been used for political leverage, this does not alter the fact that it is officially recognized as part of his full name.\n\n<<<There is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan began to publicly identify himself by the name Azikiwe, as it has always been a part of his official name.>>>"
