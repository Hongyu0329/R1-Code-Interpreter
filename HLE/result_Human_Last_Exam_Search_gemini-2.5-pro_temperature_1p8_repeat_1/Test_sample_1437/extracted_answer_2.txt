The value of the Lindhard polarization function evaluated at zero external frequency and zero momentum transfer (k=0) is equal to the negative of the density of states at the Fermi level, -N(E_F). For a three-dimensional electron gas, this value is -mk_F / (π²ħ²), where m is the electron mass, k_F is the Fermi wavevector, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.
