    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\nThe number of subgroups of a given index in a group is related to the homomorphisms from that group to a symmetric group. Specifically, the number of subgroups of index *n* in a group *G* is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of homomorphisms from *G* to the symmetric group *S<sub>n</sub>* whose images are transitive subgroups of *S<sub>n</sub>*.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, which we will denote as *G*. This is equivalent to finding the number of transitive actions of *G* on a set of 4 elements, up to equivalence. These actions correspond to conjugacy classes of homomorphisms from *G* to *S<sub>4</sub>*.\n\nA key property of the Grigorchuk group is that it is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, the image of any homomorphism from *G* to another group must also be a 2-group. The symmetric group *S<sub>4</sub>* has order 24 (which is 2<sup>3</sup> * 3). The 2-subgroups of *S<sub>4</sub>* are subgroups of its Sylow 2-subgroups, which are isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8 (*D<sub>8</sub>*). The possible orders of the image of a homomorphism from *G* to *S<sub>4</sub>* are therefore 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n\nFor a subgroup of index 4, the corresponding action on the 4 cosets must be transitive. The transitive 2-subgroups of *S<sub>4</sub>* are the Klein four-group (*V<sub>4</sub>*, which is isomorphic to **Z**<sub>2</sub> x **Z**<sub>2</sub>) and the dihedral group of order 8 (*D<sub>8</sub>*).\n\n1.  **Homomorphisms to the Dihedral Group *D<sub>8</sub>***: Another crucial property of the Grigorchuk group is related to its abelianization, *G*/[*G*,*G*], which is the largest abelian quotient of *G*. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>3</sup>. A significant result in the study of the Grigorchuk group is that all of its finite quotients are 2-groups and, furthermore, that any epimorphism from the Grigorchuk group onto a non-abelian 2-group is not possible. Since *D<sub>8</sub>* is a non-abelian 2-group, there are no surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to *D<sub>8</sub>*.\n\n2.  **Homomorphisms to the Klein Four-Group *V<sub>4</sub>***: Since *V<sub>4</sub>* is abelian, any homomorphism from *G* to *V<sub>4</sub>* must factor through the abelianization of *G*. This means we are looking for surjective homomorphisms from (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>3</sup> to *V<sub>4</sub>* (which is isomorphic to (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>2</sup>). The kernels of these homomorphisms will be subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n\nA subgroup of index 4 in *G* that corresponds to a homomorphism to *V<sub>4</sub>* must be a normal subgroup with the quotient group isomorphic to *V<sub>4</sub>*. The number of such subgroups is equal to the number of subgroups of index 4 in the abelianization, (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>3</sup>.\n\nA subgroup of index 4 in (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>3</sup> has order 8/4 = 2. A subgroup of order 2 in (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>3</sup> is generated by a single non-identity element. The group (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>3</sup> has 7 non-identity elements. Each of these elements generates a distinct subgroup of order 2. Therefore, there are 7 subgroups of order 2.\n\nEach of these 7 subgroups is of index 4, and since they are subgroups of an abelian group, they are all normal. The corresponding quotient group is (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>3</sup> / **Z**<sub>2</sub>, which is isomorphic to (**Z**/2**Z**)<sup>2</sup>, the Klein four-group *V<sub>4</sub>*.\n\nThus, the Grigorchuk group has exactly 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\n"
