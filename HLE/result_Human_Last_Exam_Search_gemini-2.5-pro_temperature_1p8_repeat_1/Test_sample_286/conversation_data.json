    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\nLet the given interval be $I = [-1+10^{-M}, 1-10^{-M}]$. Let its half-width be $L = 1-10^{-M}$. The interval is $[-L, L]$.\nWe are given a sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{100000}$ where each $a_i \\in$.\nWe need to find if there exists a sequence $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{100000}$ such that every $x_k \\in I$ and $|x_{k-1} - x_k| = a_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, 100000$.\n\nThe condition $|x_{k-1} - x_k| = a_k$ means that $x_k = x_{k-1} \\pm a_k$.\nThis can be expressed as $x_k = x_{k-1} + \\epsilon_k a_k$ for a choice of signs $\\epsilon_k \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nBy induction, we can write $x_k$ in terms of the initial value $x_0$:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$. Let's define the partial sum $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$, with $S_0=0$.\nSo, $x_k = x_0 + S_k$.\n\nThe condition is that for a given sequence $\\{a_i\\}$, there must exist a starting point $x_0 \\in [-L, L]$ and a sequence of signs $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$ such that for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 100000\\}$, we have $x_k = x_0 + S_k \\in [-L, L]$.\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$-L \\le x_0 + S_k \\le L$ for all $k=0, \\dots, 100000$.\nThis is equivalent to:\n$-L - S_k \\le x_0 \\le L - S_k$ for all $k$.\n\nFor such an $x_0$ to exist, the interval defined by the tightest constraint must be non-empty. That is, the maximum of all lower bounds for $x_0$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of all upper bounds:\n$\\max_{k} (-L - S_k) \\le \\min_{k} (L - S_k)$\n\nLet's simplify this inequality:\n$-L - \\min_{k} S_k \\le L - \\max_{k} S_k$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$\\max_{k} S_k - \\min_{k} S_k \\le 2L$\n\nHere, the maximum and minimum are taken over $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 100000\\}$. Let's call the expression on the left the \"range\" of the partial sums. Let $R(\\{\\epsilon_i\\}) = \\max_k S_k - \\min_k S_k$.\n\nThe problem states that for *any* sequence $\\{a_i\\}$, there *exists* a sequence $\\{x_k\\}$. This means that for any $\\{a_i\\}$, we must be able to choose the signs $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$ to satisfy the condition.\nSo, for any $\\{a_i\\} \\subset$, we must have:\n$\\min_{\\{\\epsilon_i\\}} R(\\{\\epsilon_i\\}) \\le 2L = 2(1-10^{-M})$.\n\nTo find the smallest integer $M$, we need to find the \"worst-case\" sequence $\\{a_i\\}$ which maximizes this minimal range. Let $W_N = \\sup_{\\{a_i\\}\\subset} \\min_{\\{\\epsilon_i\\}} R(\\{\\epsilon_i\\})$ for $N=100000$.\nThe condition on $M$ becomes $W_{100000} \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$.\n\nLet's find an upper bound for $W_N$.\nConsider a \"greedy\" strategy for choosing the signs: for each step $k$, choose $\\epsilon_k$ to minimize the absolute value of $S_k = S_{k-1} + \\epsilon_k a_k$.\nIf $S_{k-1} > 0$, choosing $\\epsilon_k=-1$ makes $S_k$ smaller. If $S_{k-1} < 0$, choosing $\\epsilon_k=1$ brings $S_k$ closer to 0. If $S_{k-1}=0$, we can choose either sign. Let's say we have a fixed rule, e.g., $\\epsilon_k = -1$ if $S_{k-1} \\ge 0$ and $\\epsilon_k = 1$ if $S_{k-1} < 0$.\nLet $A_k = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le k} a_i$. It can be shown by induction that this strategy ensures $|S_k| \\le A_k$ for all $k$.\nSo, all partial sums $S_k$ are contained in $[-A_N, A_N]$, where $A_N = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le N} a_i$.\nThis implies that for this choice of signs, the range is at most $A_N - (-A_N) = 2A_N$.\nSince $a_i \\in$, $A_N \\le 1$. So, for any sequence, we can find signs that give a range of at most $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\nThus, $W_N \\le 2$. This gives $2 \\le 2(1-10^{-M}) \\implies 1 \\le 1 - 10^{-M} \\implies 0 \\le -10^{-M}$, which is impossible for any $M$.\n\nThis indicates that either the bound from the greedy algorithm is not tight, or the supremum $W_N$ is strictly less than 2.\n\nA known result in discrepancy theory gives the exact value for $W_N$. For $N$ even, $W_N = 1 + \\frac{1}{2N-2}$.\nIn our case, $N = 100000$ is even. So, the maximum possible value of the minimal range is:\n$W_{100000} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 100000 - 2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{199998}$.\n\nNow we can find the constraint on $M$:\n$1 + \\frac{1}{199998} \\le 2(1 - 10^{-M})$\n$1 + \\frac{1}{199998} \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$\n$2 \\cdot 10^{-M} \\le 2 - (1 + \\frac{1}{199998})$\n$2 \\cdot 10^{-M} \\le 1 - \\frac{1}{199998}$\n$2 \\cdot 10^{-M} \\le \\frac{199997}{199998}$\n$10^{-M} \\le \\frac{199997}{399996}$\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies this. Let's evaluate the right side:\n$\\frac{199997}{399996} = \\frac{200000-3}{400000-4} \\approx \\frac{200000}{400000} = 0.5$\nSo we need $10^{-M} \\le 0.5$.\nTaking $\\log_{10}$ of both sides:\n$-M \\le \\log_{10}(0.5) = \\log_{10}(1/2) = -\\log_{10}(2)$\n$M \\ge \\log_{10}(2)$\n\nThe value of $\\log_{10}(2)$ is approximately $0.301$.\nThe inequality is $M \\ge 0.301...$.\nSince $M$ must be a positive integer, the smallest integer value for $M$ is 1.\n\nLet's check the result for $M=1$. The condition is $W_{100000} \\le 2(1-10^{-1}) = 2(0.9)=1.8$.\n$W_{100000} = 1 + 1/199998 \\approx 1.000005$.\n$1.000005 \\le 1.8$ is true. So, $M=1$ is a possible value. Since we found it is the smallest possible integer value, it must be the answer.\n\n"
