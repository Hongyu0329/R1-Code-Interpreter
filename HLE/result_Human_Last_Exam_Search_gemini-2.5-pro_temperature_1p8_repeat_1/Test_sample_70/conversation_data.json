    "The flag of Denmark, featuring a white cross on a solid red background, is composed of two colors arranged in a cross pattern. When this design is represented as a matrix and values are chosen to maximize its rank, the structure yields a maximum of two linearly independent rows or columns. One set of rows/columns corresponds to the white cross, and the other to the red field, resulting in a linear algebraic rank of 2.\n\nTo identify the flags of African nations with the same rank, we must find those whose designs also result in a maximal rank of 2. This typically includes flags with two colors in a simple arrangement, such as bicolors, or flags with a single-colored field featuring a simple, single-colored emblem. Designs with three or more colors in distinct sections (like tricolors) or more complex patterns (such as triangles, multiple stripes, or detailed emblems) will have a higher rank.\n\nAfter analyzing the flags of all African nations, the following countries have flags with a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2:\n\n*   **Morocco:** The flag has a solid red field with a green pentagram in the center. A matrix row that passes through the green star is linearly independent from a row that is entirely red, resulting in two distinct types of rows and a rank of 2.\n*   **Nigeria:** The flag is a vertical bicolor with three stripes of green, white, and green. Having only two colors in this arrangement creates two linearly independent columns (a green column and a white column), leading to a rank of 2.\n*   **Somalia:** The flag consists of a light blue field with a white five-pointed star in the middle. The rows of the matrix that include parts of the white star are linearly independent from the solid blue rows. This creates two types of rows and thus a rank of 2.\n*   **Tunisia:** The flag features a red field with a central white disk that contains a red crescent and star. The rows containing the white disk are linearly independent from the all-red rows, resulting in two distinct row types and a rank of 2.\n\n<<<Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, Tunisia>>>"
