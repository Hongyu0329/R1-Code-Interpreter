    "### Passenger Liner Sheherazade Was the Largest French Ship Sunk by a U-boat Before the 1940 Armistice\n\nThe largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the passenger liner **SS Sheherazade**, with a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 13,467. The ship was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-48 on December 11, 1939.\n\nThe sinking of the *Sheherazade* stands out as the most significant loss in terms of tonnage for the French merchant marine due to U-boat activity during the initial phase of World War II, often referred to as the \"Phoney War.\"\n\nAnother notable and much larger French passenger liner, the **SS Champlain** (28,124 GRT), was also lost during this period. However, the *Champlain* struck an air-laid German mine on June 17, 1940, off the coast of La Pallice and was subsequently torpedoed by the U-65 a few days later while it was already a wreck. Because the primary cause of its sinking was a mine, it is not categorized as a loss directly attributable to a U-boat attack.\n\nBetween the start of the war on September 3, 1939, and May 1, 1940, the French merchant marine lost a total of sixteen ships to U-boats, amounting to 74,648 tons. The sinking of the *Sheherazade* represents the largest single component of this loss. Other significant French vessels sunk by U-boats in this timeframe include several smaller cargo ships and the submarine *Doris* (552 tons displacement), which was torpedoed by U-9 on May 8, 1940.\n\nThe period following the fall of France in June 1940 saw a dramatic increase in U-boat effectiveness as they gained access to French Atlantic ports, leading to what the German submariners called the \"Happy Time.\"\n\n<<<SS Sheherazade>>>"
