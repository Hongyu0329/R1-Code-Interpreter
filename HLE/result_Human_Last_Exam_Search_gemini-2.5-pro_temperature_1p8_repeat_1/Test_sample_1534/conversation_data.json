    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe brain of the dwarf cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, is a complex structure with numerous lobes organized around the esophagus. The palliovisceral lobe is part of the posterior subesophageal mass, which controls various motor functions. A 3D brain atlas created for the dwarf cuttlefish reveals the spatial relationship of these intricate structures.\n\nThe posterior region of the subesophageal mass contains a cluster of lobes responsible for controlling the more posterior parts of the cuttlefish's body. This includes the palliovisceral lobe, which is involved in escape responses and inking. Directly behind this lobe, one can find the posterior chromatophore lobes, which control the chromatophores on the mantle, and the fin lobes, which control the movement of the fins. One study on *Sepia officinalis* also identifies the magnocellular lobe as being part of this posterior group. A posterior-view diagram of the dwarf cuttlefish brain shows the posterior chromatophore lobes and fin lobes in a position posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
