    "The maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with 128 vertices is 128.\n\nHere is the reasoning for this conclusion:\n\n*   **Induced Cliques:** A clique is a set of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. When a clique is referred to as an \"induced subgraph,\" it means the subgraph formed by these vertices includes all the edges that exist between them in the original graph. By definition, a clique forms a complete induced subgraph.\n\n*   **Hierarchy of Clique Sizes:** If a graph contains an induced clique of a certain size, say *k*, then it automatically contains induced cliques of all smaller sizes from 1 to *k-1*. This is because any subset of the *k* vertices that form the large clique will also be fully connected to each other.\n\n*   **Number of Sizes Equals the Maximum Size:** Due to this hierarchical nature, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any given graph is {1, 2, ..., *m*}, where *m* is the size of the largest clique in that graph. The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to *m*. The size of the largest clique in a graph is known as its clique number.\n\n*   **Maximizing the Clique Number:** The problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices. For a graph with *n* vertices, the largest possible clique number is *n*.\n\n*   **The Complete Graph:** This maximum is achieved with a complete graph, denoted as K_n. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For a graph with 128 vertices, the complete graph K_128 has a clique number of 128.\n\nIn the complete graph K_128, any subset of vertices forms a clique. Therefore, it is possible to form cliques of size 1, 2, 3, and so on, all the way up to 128. This results in 128 different possible sizes for induced cliques.\n\n<<<128>>>"
