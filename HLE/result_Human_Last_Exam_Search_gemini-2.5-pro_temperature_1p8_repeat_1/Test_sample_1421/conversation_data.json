    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields. This formalism is essential to correctly incorporate the principles of quantum statistics for fermions, such as the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe partition function in statistical mechanics is defined as the trace of the thermal operator:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`\nwhere:\n*   `H` is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n*   `β` is the inverse temperature, `β = 1 / (k_B T)`.\n\nTo express this in the language of path integrals, one performs a Wick rotation to imaginary time (`t → -iτ`), where the time variable `τ` is integrated over the interval `[0, β]`. For fermions, the fields are not described by ordinary numbers but by anticommuting Grassmann numbers.\n\nThe resulting formula for the fermionic partition function is:\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ * e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])`\n<br>\n\nHere’s a breakdown of each component of the formula:\n\n*   **`∫ Dψ̄Dψ`**: This represents the functional integral, or path integral, over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields `ψ(x, τ)` and `ψ̄(x, τ)`. These fields are functions of imaginary time `τ` and position `x`, and they take values in a Grassmann algebra.\n\n*   **Boundary Conditions**: A crucial feature for fermions is that the trace operation imposes **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in the imaginary time direction. This means the fields at the beginning and end of the imaginary time interval are related by a minus sign:\n    `ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)`\n    `ψ̄(x, 0) = -ψ̄(x, β)`\n    This is in contrast to bosonic fields, which obey periodic boundary conditions.\n\n*   **`S_E[ψ̄, ψ]`**: This is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system. It is obtained from the standard (Minkowskian) action by the substitution `t = -iτ`. For a system of non-interacting fermions described by a Hamiltonian `H`, the Euclidean action is given by:\n    `S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x  ψ̄(x, τ) (ħ∂_τ + H) ψ(x, τ)`\n\n    In this expression, `H` is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator, for instance, `H = - (ħ²/2m)∇² - μ`, where `μ` is the chemical potential.\n\nFor actions that are quadratic in the fermionic fields (like the one for non-interacting fermions), the Gaussian integral over Grassmann variables can be performed exactly, yielding a determinant.\n\n`Z = det(ħ∂_τ + H)`\n\nThis determinant is taken over the space of anti-periodic functions.\n\n<<<The fermionic partition function `Z` in the imaginary time path integral formalism is expressed as a functional integral over Grassmann fields `ψ` and `ψ̄` with anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time `τ`. The formula is:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ * e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])`\n\nwhere the integral is over all field configurations satisfying `ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)`, and `S_E` is the Euclidean action, typically of the form:\n\n`S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x  ψ̄(x, τ) (ħ∂_τ + H) ψ(x, τ)`>>>"
