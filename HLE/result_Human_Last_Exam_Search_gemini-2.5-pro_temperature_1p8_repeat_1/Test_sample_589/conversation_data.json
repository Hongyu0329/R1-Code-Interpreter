    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is a scene that has been described in various online forums and discussions, but pinpointing the exact movie has proven to be elusive through extensive research.\n\nWhile there are numerous films that feature teenagers on bicycles, and scenes involving chases or stunts, the specific combination of a pink bike, a teenager, and a game of \"chicken\" with a car is not a widely documented or well-known scene in a major Hollywood production.\n\nSeveral films have been suggested in online discussions, but none definitively match the detailed description. The \"kids on bikes\" subgenre, popular in the 1980s, often features bicycle scenes, but no specific movie has been confirmed to contain this exact scenario. Similarly, coming-of-age films and action movies have been searched without a conclusive result.\n\nIt is possible that the user may be recalling a scene from a lesser-known film, a television show, or misremembering certain details of a more popular movie. For instance, the upcoming reboot of *The Naked Gun* is slated to feature a pink bicycle in a comedic context, but the film has not yet been released and details of the scene are unknown.\n\nDespite a thorough search of film databases, movie scene descriptions, and online communities dedicated to identifying films, a definitive match for a teenager on a pink bike pedaling directly toward an oncoming car in a major Hollywood feature film could not be found.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify the specific Hollywood feature film based on the provided description.>>>"
