    "A finite group G is called a filled group if all its maximal by inclusion product-free sets are complete, meaning their union with their product set covers all non-identity elements of the group. The classification of finite filled nilpotent groups reveals that such groups are either of odd order or are 2-groups.\n\nA subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all `a, b` in `S`, the product `ab` is not in `S`. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A product-free set `S` is said to fill the group `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or in the set of products `SS = {s1*s2 | s1, s2 in S}`. A group in which every maximal by inclusion product-free set fills the group is called a filled group.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established in the literature. According to research by Anabanti and Hart, a finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following:\n\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, denoted as C_3.\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C_5.\n*   A 2-group (a group where every element has an order that is a power of 2).\n\nIt is worth noting that the filled abelian groups, a subset of nilpotent groups, were classified earlier by Street and Whitehead. They determined that a finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is C_3, C_5, or an elementary abelian 2-group (a group where every non-identity element has order 2). The work on filled nilpotent groups extends this classification to the non-abelian nilpotent case. The filled groups of odd order are precisely C_3 and C_5.\n\nIn summary, the finite filled nilpotent groups are the cyclic groups C_3 and C_5, and all finite 2-groups.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are the cyclic groups of order 3 (C3), the cyclic groups of order 5 (C5), and the finite 2-groups.>>>"
