    "The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This maximum number is the highest possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies these conditions.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of vertices in the graph, so $n = 12345$.\n\n**1. Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\nThe chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique color to each vertex.\n\nA fundamental property of graph coloring is that the chromatic number of a complete graph on $n$ vertices, $K_n$, is exactly $n$. This is because every vertex in a complete graph is adjacent to every other vertex, requiring all vertices to have a different color.\n\nConversely, if a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices has a chromatic number of $n$, it must be the complete graph $K_n$. If it were not complete, there would be at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices. These two vertices could be assigned the same color, which means that fewer than $n$ colors would be needed, contradicting the assumption that the chromatic number is $n$.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be less than $n$. This establishes an upper bound:\n$\\chi(G) \\le n - 1$\nFor $n = 12345$, the maximum possible chromatic number is at most $12344$.\n\n**2. Achievability of the Upper Bound**\n\nNext, we must determine if a chromatic number of $n-1$ is achievable for a graph that is not complete. We can show this by constructing such a graph. Consider a graph $G^*$ created by taking the complete graph $K_{n-1}$ (a clique of size $n-1$) and adding one additional vertex that is isolated from all other vertices.\n\n*   This graph $G^*$ has $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$ vertices.\n*   This graph $G^*$ is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{n-1}$ component.\n*   The chromatic number of this graph is determined by the maximum chromatic number of its connected components. The components are the $K_{n-1}$ and the single vertex ($K_1$).\n*   $\\chi(G^*) = \\max(\\chi(K_{n-1}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(n-1, 1) = n-1$.\n\nFor $n = 12345$, this graph has a chromatic number of $12344$.\n\nAnother example of a graph that meets the criteria is a complete graph $K_n$ with a single edge removed ($K_n - e$). This graph is no longer complete, and it contains a clique of size $n-1$, which means its chromatic number is at least $n-1$. Since it is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than $n$. Thus, its chromatic number is exactly $n-1$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum number of colors needed for a proper coloring of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph is $12345 - 1 = 12344$. The mention of the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ does not alter this conclusion, which is consistent with Brooks' theorem. Brooks' theorem states that for a connected graph that is not complete, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$. In our example of $K_{12345}$ with one edge removed, the maximum degree is $12344$, and the chromatic number is also $12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
