    "## From Ancient Sign to Germanic Seeking: Tracing a PIE Verb\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti, meaning \"'(s)he's giving a sign,\" evolved through a series of predictable sound changes into the Proto-Germanic verb *sōkīþi, meaning \"'(s)he seeks.\" This reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is the direct ancestor of verbs with the same meaning in Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\nThe transformation from PIE *seh2gieti to Proto-Germanic *sōkīþi illustrates key linguistic principles, notably Grimm's Law, which systematically altered the consonants of the Germanic languages, distinguishing them from other Indo-European tongues. The PIE root *seh₂g- is the foundation for the Germanic verb \"to seek\" and its various forms.\n\nThe descendants of this PIE verb in the requested early Germanic languages are as follows:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** The reconstructed third-person singular present indicative form is ***sōkīþi***. The infinitive form of the verb is reconstructed as **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n*   **Old Norse:** The verb \"to seek\" is ***sǿkja*** or ***sækja***. The third-person singular present indicative form would be ***sækir***.\n\n*   **Old English:** The verb appears as ***sēċan*** or ***sēċean***. The third-person singular present indicative is attested as ***sēceð***.\n\n*   **Old High German:** The verb is found as ***suohhen*** or ***suochen***. An example from an Old High German text shows the third-person singular present indicative form as ***suohhit***.\n\nThe original meaning of \"giving a sign\" or \"tracking\" in the PIE verb, as seen in the related Latin *sāgīre* ('to be keen-nosed'), evolved into the more general sense of \"to look for\" or \"to seek\" in the Germanic languages. This etymological journey showcases the dynamic nature of language, where meanings can shift and adapt over millennia while still retaining a traceable linguistic lineage."
