    "To date, the human let-7 family has been identified to comprise 10 mature microRNAs. These include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202.\n\nThese mature miRNAs originate from 12 or 13 different precursor genes located across various chromosomes. For example, some sources state there are 13 members when referring to the precursor genes, such as let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3. However, the number of unique, mature, and functional miRNA molecules is 10. The let-7 family is highly conserved across animal species and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression related to cell development and differentiation.\n\n<<<10>>>"
