    "<<<\nThe achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n\n*   **4 (S₄)**\n*   **42m (D₂d)**\n*   **6 (C₃h)**\n*   **6m2 (D₃h)**\n*   **43m (Tᵈ)**\n\n### Explanation:\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, can occur in crystals that lack a center of symmetry (non-centrosymmetric). While it is a defining characteristic of chiral materials, some achiral crystals can also exhibit this property.\n\nThe 32 crystallographic point groups can be categorized based on their symmetry elements, which in turn determine their physical properties.\n\n1.  **Achiral vs. Chiral:** Chiral crystal classes lack any improper symmetry operations such as inversion centers, mirror planes, or roto-inversion axes. There are 11 such chiral (or enantiomorphic) classes. The remaining 21 classes are achiral because they possess at least one improper symmetry element.\n2.  **Non-polar vs. Polar:** Polar crystal classes have a unique polar axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar classes. The other 22 classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Symmetry for Optical Activity:** The primary requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be non-centrosymmetric (lacking a center of inversion). All 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups can, in principle, exhibit optical activity.\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions: being achiral, non-polar, and possessing the symmetry for optical activity (i.e., being non-centrosymmetric). By analyzing the 32 point groups, we find a specific subset that fits this description. There are five crystal classes that are non-centrosymmetric, but are neither chiral nor polar. These five classes are the answer to the question."
