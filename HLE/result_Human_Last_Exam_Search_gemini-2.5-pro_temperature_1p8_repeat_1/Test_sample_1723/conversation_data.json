    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration in their caps or flesh, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nFor instance, the striking *Lactarius indigo* has a cream to yellowish spore print. Another mushroom with a notable blue appearance, *Entoloma hochstetteri*, produces a reddish-pink spore print. The Blue Roundhead mushroom, *Stropharia caerulea*, has a purple-brown to purple-black spore print. Other blue-hued mushrooms like *Mycena cyanorrhiza* have a white spore print, and *Cortinarius rotundisporus* has a reddish-brown spore print.\n\nTherefore, the color of the mushroom itself is not an indicator of its spore print color.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
