    "The oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins is largely determined by the identity of the amino acid residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). By analyzing these key positions in each sequence, a prediction can be made.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n    *   The 'a' positions are occupied by Alanine (A) and the 'd' positions by Leucine (L). A canonical (a)-Ile/(d)-Leu pattern is a strong indicator of a dimeric coiled coil. Having Alanine at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position is also characteristic of a **dimer (2)**.\n\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n    *   This sequence is very similar to the first, with primarily Alanine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd', predisposing it to be a dimer. A key difference is the substitution of one Leucine at a 'd' position with a polar Asparagine (N). The presence of a polar residue within the hydrophobic core generally destabilizes higher-order oligomers and strongly favors a **dimer (2)**.\n\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n    *   Here, the 'a' positions are Alanine (A) and the 'd' positions are predominantly Isoleucine (I), with one Tryptophan (W). The combination of a small residue like Alanine at the 'a' position and a β-branched amino acid like Isoleucine at the 'd' position is known to promote the formation of **tetramers (4)** to allow for efficient packing of the side chains in the hydrophobic core.\n\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n    *   This sequence has the polar residue Glutamine (Q) at all 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions. Burying polar residues in the hydrophobic 'a' position is generally unfavorable. This pattern strongly directs the formation of a **dimer (2)**, where the unfavorable interactions can be more easily accommodated.\n\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n    *   The 'a' positions are Alanine (A) and the 'd' positions are occupied by Threonine (T). Threonine is a polar, β-branched amino acid. Experimental studies have shown that placing a single Threonine at a 'd' position can specify the formation of a **trimer (3)**. This is because the trimeric arrangement can better accommodate the steric and hydrogen-bonding potential of the threonine side chains.\n\nBased on this analysis, the predicted oligomeric states are 2, 2, 4, 2, and 3, which corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
