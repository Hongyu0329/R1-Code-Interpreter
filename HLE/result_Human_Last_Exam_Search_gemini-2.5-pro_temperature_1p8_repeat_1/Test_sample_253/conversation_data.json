    "To determine the binary pattern after applying cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 iterations starting from a single cell in state 1, one must follow a specific set of rules that govern the evolution of the pattern.\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The name \"Rule 110\" is the decimal equivalent of the binary sequence `01101110`, which encodes the output for each of the eight possible three-cell neighborhood patterns.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | New State of Center Cell |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with a single '1' (surrounded by '0's), each subsequent line (generation) is produced by applying these rules. The evolution of the pattern for the first 20 steps is as follows:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** 1\n*   **Generation 1:** 11\n*   **Generation 2:** 111\n*   **Generation 3:** 1101\n*   **Generation 4:** 11111\n*   **Generation 5:** 110001\n*   **Generation 6:** 1110011\n*   **Generation 7:** 11010111\n*   **Generation 8:** 111111001\n*   **Generation 9:** 1100001011\n*   **Generation 10:** 11100111101\n*   **Generation 11:** 110101000111\n*   **Generation 12:** 1111110101001\n*   **Generation 13:** 110000111101011\n*   **Generation 14:** 1110010001111101\n*   **Generation 15:** 11010101010000111\n*   **Generation 16:** 111111111101001001\n*   **Generation 17:** 1100000000111011011\n*   **Generation 18:** 1110000001001110001\n*   **Generation 19:** 11010000110100010111\n*   **Generation 20:** 111110010111010111001\n\nAfter 20 applications of Rule 110, the resulting binary pattern is `111110010111010111001`.\n\n<<<111110010111010111001>>>"
