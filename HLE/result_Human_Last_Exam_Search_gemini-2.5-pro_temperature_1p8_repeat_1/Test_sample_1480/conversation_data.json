    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level is determined by combining the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part of the rule) with the membership value of the consequent (the \"THEN\" part of the rule). This combination is performed using a t-norm (triangular norm) operation, which functions as a fuzzy logical \"AND\".\n\nGiven values are:\n*   Firing strength of the antecedent, `Phi_k(x′)` = **0.7**\n*   Membership of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)` = **0.9**\n\nA t-norm is a function that takes two values from the interval and returns a single value in the same interval. Since the specific t-norm was not mentioned, the rule activation level can be calculated using the most common t-norms:\n\n*   **Minimum T-Norm (Gödel t-norm):** This is the most common t-norm and is defined as the minimum of the two values.\n    *   `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Product T-Norm:** This t-norm is the algebraic product of the two values.\n    *   `Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\n*   **Łukasiewicz T-Norm:** This t-norm is defined as the maximum of 0 or the sum of the values minus 1.\n    *   `Activation Level = max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nEach t-norm provides a different interpretation of the fuzzy intersection, resulting in a different activation level.\n\n<<<Using the Minimum t-norm, the activation level is 0.7. Using the Product t-norm, it is 0.63. Using the Łukasiewicz t-norm, it is 0.6.>>>"
