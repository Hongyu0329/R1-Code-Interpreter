    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a type of substituted triangulene. Triangulenes are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons composed of fused benzene rings that typically exhibit high symmetry.\n\nThe core of this molecule is a planar, triangular-shaped structure made of fused aromatic rings, which possesses a threefold axis of rotation (C₃). The molecule is substituted with three linear ethynyl (`-C#C`) groups at symmetrically equivalent positions around this core.\n\nThe symmetry elements of this molecule include:\n*   A principal C₃ rotational axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n*   Three C₂ rotational axes lying in the molecular plane.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ), each containing the C₃ axis.\n*   An S₃ improper rotation axis.\n\nThe combination of these symmetry elements uniquely defines the **D₃ₕ** point group. The planar structure and threefold symmetry are key characteristics of this molecular family.\n\n<<<D₃ₕ>>>"
