    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. The Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso and pelvis, with the backbend initiating from the upper spine. In contrast, the Balanchine technique often permits a more open hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, meticulous alignment is crucial, and students are trained to keep the hips square to ensure movements are executed with precision and safety. This technique focuses on the body as a whole, coordinating the arms, legs, shoulders, and head while maintaining a strong, stable core. When executing a cambré, the idea is to keep the hips and legs stationary, preventing them from moving forward to compensate for the backbend.\n\nThe Balanchine method, while rooted in classical technique, adapts movements for a specific aesthetic effect, such as creating longer and more dynamic lines. A well-known characteristic of the Balanchine style is the open hip in an arabesque, which creates the illusion of a higher leg. This principle of allowing the hip to lift extends to other movements, breaking the traditional \"box\" alignment of the shoulders and hips. The Balanchine approach treats the hip as part of the leg, allowing the square alignment of the body to be altered for choreographic purposes. This method is also known for its speed, deep plié, and more open and sometimes \"broken\" port de bras.\n\nWhile other elements like arm placement, speed, and the degree of the backbend are also styled differently in each method, the intentional use of an open hip in Balanchine versus the strict maintenance of square hips in Vaganova is a fundamental and defining difference in the execution of movements like a cambré derrière.\n\n<<<B>>>"
