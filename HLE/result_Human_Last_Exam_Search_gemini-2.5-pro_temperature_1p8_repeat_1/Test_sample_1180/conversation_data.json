    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, we must analyze the 2-adic properties of its branch points. The thickness is a numerical invariant that describes the nature of the singularity in the stable model of the curve.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Branch Points\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. Its branch points are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ and the point at infinity. Let the finite branch points be $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5$. To analyze their 2-adic valuations, it is easier to study the roots of the reciprocal polynomial. Let $x=1/y$. The equation becomes $z^2 = \\frac{2}{y^5} + \\frac{2}{y^3} + 1 = \\frac{y^5+2y^2+2}{y^5}$.\n\n### 2. Valuations of the Roots\nTo understand the structure of the stable reduction, we first need to determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$. A standard method for this is the use of a Newton polygon for the reciprocal polynomial $Q(y) = y^5 + 2y^2 + 2 = 0$.\n\nThe vertices of the Newton polygon for $Q(y)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v_2$ are determined by the points $(i, v_2(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $y^i$. The points are $(5, v_2(1)=0)$, $(2, v_2(2)=1)$, and $(0, v_2(2)=1)$. The lower convex hull of these points is the single line segment connecting $(5,0)$ and $(0,1)$. The slope of this segment is $\\frac{1-0}{0-5} = -1/5$.\n\nAccording to Newton's polygon theory, the 2-adic valuation of all five roots $y_1, \\dots, y_5$ of $Q(y)$ is the negative of the slope, so $v_2(y_i) = 1/5$ for all $i$. This implies that the roots of the original polynomial, $\\alpha_i = 1/y_i$, all have valuation $v_2(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$.\n\n### 3. Clustering of Branch Points and Stable Reduction\nThe structure of the special fiber of the stable model is determined by the clustering of the branch points. In this case, the set of six branch points is $B = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5, \\infty\\}$.\n\nThe five finite branch points $\\{\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_5\\}$ form one cluster, as their pairwise 2-adic distances are all equal and smaller than their distances to the point at infinity. The point at infinity forms a second cluster. This partition of the branch points into two sets of odd size (5 and 1) indicates that the special fiber of the stable reduction consists of two components intersecting at a single double point (a node).\n\n### 4. Calculating the Thickness\nThe \"thickness\" of this double point, which can also be described as the length of the edge connecting the two components in the dual graph of the stable reduction, can be calculated using the resultant of the polynomials corresponding to the clusters of branch points.\n\nTo make the calculation tractable, we perform a change of variables $x' = 1/x$. This moves the branch point at infinity to $x'=0$. The new equation is of the form $w^2 = x'(x'^5 + 2x'^2 + 2)$. The branch points are now the roots of $x'(x'^5+2x'^2+2)=0$. They are $\\{0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5\\}$, where $\\beta_i = 1/\\alpha_i$ are the roots of $h(x') = x'^5 + 2x'^2 + 2$.\n\nThe partition of the branch points is now $\\{0\\}$ and $\\{\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5\\}$. The thickness is given by the valuation of the resultant of the polynomials defining these two sets. Let $f_1(x')=x'$ and $f_2(x')=x'^5+2x'^2+2$.\n\nThe resultant of $f_1$ and $f_2$ is given by:\n$Res(f_1, f_2) = Res(x', x'^5 + 2x'^2 + 2) = f_2(0) = 2$.\n\nThe thickness is the valuation of this resultant, normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\nThickness = $v_2(Res(f_1, f_2)) = v_2(2) = 1$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
