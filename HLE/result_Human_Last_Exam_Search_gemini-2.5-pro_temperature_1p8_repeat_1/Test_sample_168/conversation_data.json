    "Of the animals listed, the one that might be able to hear human muscle twitches is the herring. This is because the sounds produced by human muscle contractions are of a very low frequency, and herring have a specialized auditory system that allows them to detect such sounds.\n\nA human muscle twitch, or fasciculation, is a spontaneous and involuntary contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers. The sound generated by a sustained human skeletal muscle contraction has a frequency of approximately 25 Â± 2.5 Hz. Further research indicates that the majority of the sound energy from muscle movement is below 20 Hz, which is considered infrasound and is inaudible to humans, whose hearing range is typically between 20 and 20,000 Hz. Some studies have even recorded low-frequency components of muscle sounds between 3 and 5 Hz.\n\nExamining the hearing capabilities of the animals in the options reveals the following:\n*   **Human:** With a lower hearing limit of about 20 Hz, humans are generally unable to perceive the low-frequency sounds of their own muscle twitches.\n*   **Dog:** A dog's hearing range is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz, meaning they cannot hear sounds as low as a muscle twitch.\n*   **Bat:** Bats are known for their high-frequency hearing, which they use for echolocation, with a lower limit of around 1,000 Hz for some species. This is far above the frequency of muscle twitches.\n*   **Whale:** The hearing range of whales varies. Toothed whales are adapted for high-frequency sounds. Baleen whales, however, are known for their excellent low-frequency hearing, with some species capable of hearing sounds as low as 7 Hz. This would allow them to hear the ~25 Hz sound of a muscle twitch, but possibly not the very lowest frequencies of 3-5 Hz.\n*   **Herring:** This family of fish are considered \"hearing specialists\". They can detect frequencies from 30 Hz up to at least 4,000 Hz. Crucially, they are also sensitive to infrasound, with some being able to detect frequencies as low as 5 Hz. This places the full range of human muscle twitch frequencies within their hearing capabilities.\n\nTherefore, given its specialized ability to hear very low-frequency sounds, the herring is a plausible candidate for an animal that could hear human muscle twitches.\n\n<<<C>>>"
