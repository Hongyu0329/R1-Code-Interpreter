    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, can be determined using a specific formula. For the given curve, the equation is (cos(9t), sin(5t)), so a=9 and b=5.\n\nThe integers a=9 and b=5 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1) and both are odd. In such cases, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nPlugging in the values of a=9 and b=5 into this formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nTherefore, the curve consisting of all points (cos(9t), sin(5t)) has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
