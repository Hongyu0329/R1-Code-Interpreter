    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as Q128. A power subgroup is equivalent to a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. To determine the number of power subgroups, we need to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of Q128.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_2^n is of order 2^n. For Q128, the order is 128 = 2^7, so n=7. It can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_2^n = < a, x | a^(2^(n-1)) = 1, x^2 = a^(2^(n-2)), xax^(-1) = a^(-1) >\n\nFor Q128 (n=7), the relations are:\n*   a^64 = 1\n*   x^2 = a^32\n*   xax^(-1) = a^(-1)\n\nThe elements of Q128 consist of two types:\n1.  Powers of `a`: The subgroup generated by `a`, denoted as `<a>`, is a cyclic group of order 64. The elements are {1, a, a^2, ..., a^63}.\n2.  Elements outside of `<a>`: These are of the form `a^i * x` for i = 0, 1, ..., 63. There are 64 such elements.\n\nWe can count the cyclic subgroups by considering these two sets of elements.\n\n**1. Cyclic subgroups within `<a>`:**\nThe subgroup `<a>` is a cyclic group of order 64. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group is equal to the number of divisors of its order. The order is 64 = 2^6. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Thus, there are 6 + 1 = 7 subgroups. These are generated by `a`, `a^2`, `a^4`, `a^8`, `a^16`, `a^32`, and `a^64` (the trivial subgroup).\n\n**2. Cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside `<a>`:**\nThe elements outside `<a>` are of the form `a^i * x`. Let's determine the order of these elements.\n(a^i * x)^2 = a^i * x * a^i * x = a^i * (x * a^i * x^(-1)) * x^2 = a^i * a^(-i) * a^32 = a^32.\n(a^i * x)^4 = ((a^i * x)^2)^2 = (a^32)^2 = a^64 = 1.\nSo, all 64 elements of the form `a^i*x` have order 4.\n\nNow, we must count how many distinct cyclic subgroups these 64 elements generate. Let H_i = <a^i * x>. A generator for this subgroup is `a^i*x`. The other non-identity elements are `(a^i*x)^2 = a^32` and `(a^i*x)^3 = a^i*x*a^32 = a^(i-32)*x` (since `xa^k=a^-k x`). However, it is simpler to note that `H_i = {1, a^i*x, a^32, a^(32+i)*x}`.\n\nTwo such subgroups, H_i and H_j, are identical if and only if `a^j*x` is a generator of H_i. The generators of H_i are `a^i*x` and `a^(32+i)*x`. Therefore, H_i = H_j if and only if j is congruent to i or i+32 modulo 64. This means that each unique cyclic subgroup is generated by exactly two of these elements. For example, `<x> = <a^32*x>`.\n\nSince there are 64 such elements and each subgroup has 2 generators of this form, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by these elements is 64 / 2 = 32. These are all of order 4 and are distinct from the cyclic subgroups contained entirely within `<a>`.\n\n**Total Number of Power Subgroups:**\nThe total number of power (cyclic) subgroups is the sum of the subgroups from both categories:\n*   7 subgroups from `<a>`.\n*   32 subgroups from elements outside `<a>`.\n\nTotal = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nA known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups of the generalized quaternion group Q_2^n is `2^(n-2) + n`. For Q128, n=7, so the number of cyclic subgroups is `2^(7-2) + 7 = 2^5 + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39`. This confirms the result.\n\n<<<39>>>"
