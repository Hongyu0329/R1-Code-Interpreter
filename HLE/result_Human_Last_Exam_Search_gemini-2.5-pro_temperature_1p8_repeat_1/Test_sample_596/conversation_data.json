    "There is exactly one higher dimensional rooted forest `(F,R)` of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fails to have the forest `F` simplicially collapse onto the root `R`.\n\nThis conclusion is drawn from modern results in combinatorial topology that relate simplicial collapsibility of rooted forests to discrete Morse theory and the spectra of higher-dimensional Laplacian matrices. A rooted forest `(F, R)` fails to simplicially collapse to its root if and only if a specific relative homology group, `H₁(F, R)`, is non-trivial.\n\nFor the standard triangulation of the Möbius strip, a non-orientable surface, there is a unique forest `F` (consisting of all the 2-dimensional faces of the triangulation) which, for a specific choice of root `R`, gives rise to a non-trivial homology group `H₁(F, R)`. This group has order 2.\n\nIn a key paper on the subject by Contreras, Tawfeek, and Scoville, the authors analyze the generating functions for rooted forests on the Möbius strip. By comparing the generating function for *all* rooted forests (derived from the Laplacian matrix) with the generating function for rooted forests that *do* collapse (which correspond to discrete gradient fields), they identify those that fail.\n\nTheir calculation shows a discrepancy between the two generating functions:\n*   `det(Δ₂ + λI) = λ¹⁰ + 15λ⁹ + 85λ⁸ + 225λ⁷ + 275λ⁶ + 125λ⁵`\n*   The generating function for collapsing forests is `λ¹⁰ + 15λ⁹ + 85λ⁸ + 225λ⁷ + 275λ⁶ + 121λ⁵`.\n\nThe difference in the coefficients of the `λ⁵` term is `125 - 121 = 4`. This difference accounts for the sum of the squares of the orders of the non-trivial homology groups for the non-collapsing forests. Since the responsible homology group has order 2, its square is 4. The total difference of 4 thus implies there is exactly one such non-collapsing rooted forest.\n\n<<<1>>>"
