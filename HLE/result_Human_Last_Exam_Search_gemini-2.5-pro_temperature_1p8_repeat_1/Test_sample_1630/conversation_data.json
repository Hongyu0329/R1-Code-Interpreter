    "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the maximum number of fixed points.\n\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nLet $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ with $a \\neq 0$.\nLet $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ with $p \\neq 0$.\n\nThe problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n$f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For this quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive, and its discriminant must be negative.\n1.  $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$.\n2.  $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\nThis means the function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing.\n\nSimilarly, for $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$:\n1.  $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$.\n2.  $(2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0 \\implies 4q^2 - 12pr < 0 \\implies q^2 < 3pr$.\nThis means the function $g(x)$ is also strictly increasing.\n\nWe are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$. The degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees.\nDegree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) = x$, which can be written as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\nLet $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $k(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\nNow we need to determine if it is possible to have 9 fixed points. We can use Rolle's Theorem, which states that between any two distinct real roots of a differentiable function, there must be at least one real root of its derivative.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of real roots of $k(x)=0$. According to Rolle's Theorem, its derivative, $k'(x)$, must have at least $N-1$ real roots.\nLet's find the derivative $k'(x)$:\n$k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n\nNow, let's determine the degree of the polynomial $k'(x)$.\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n$f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\nTherefore, $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n$g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\nThe product $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\nSo, $k'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\n\nSo, the number of roots of $k'(x)$ is at most 8. This implies:\n$N - 1 \\le 8 \\implies N \\le 9$.\n\nThis again confirms that the maximum number of fixed points is 9. To check if this maximum can be reached, we can continue the argument.\nFor $k(x)=0$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $k'(x)=0$ must have 8 distinct real roots.\nLet's check the derivative of $k'(x)$, which is $k''(x)$.\n$k''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x))$.\nUsing the product rule and the chain rule:\n$k''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n\nLet's determine the degree of $k''(x)$.\n*   $f''(x)$ has degree 1.\n*   $g(x)$ has degree 3.\n*   $g'(x)$ has degree 2.\n*   $g''(x)$ has degree 1.\n\nThe degree of the term $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $\\text{deg}(f'') \\times \\text{deg}(g) + 2 \\times \\text{deg}(g') = 1 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 2 = 3 + 4 = 7$.\nThe degree of the term $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $\\text{deg}(f') \\times \\text{deg}(g) + \\text{deg}(g'') = 2 \\times 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nTo find the leading term of $k''(x)$, let $f(x) \\approx ax^3$ and $g(x) \\approx px^3$.\nThen $f'(x) \\approx 3ax^2$, $f''(x) \\approx 6ax$. And $g'(x) \\approx 3px^2$, $g''(x) \\approx 6px$.\nThe leading term of $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $6a(px^3)(3px^2)^2 = 54ap^3x^7$.\nThe leading term of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $3a(px^3)^2(6px) = 18ap^3x^7$.\nThe leading term of $k''(x)$ is $54ap^3x^7 + 18ap^3x^7 = 72ap^3x^7$.\nSince $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $72ap^3$ is not zero. So, $k''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\nA polynomial of degree 7 can have at most 7 real roots.\n*   If $k''(x)$ has 7 roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, $k'(x)$ can have at most $7+1=8$ roots.\n*   If $k'(x)$ has 8 roots, then $k(x)$ can have at most $8+1=9$ roots.\n\nThis confirms that there is no structural impossibility of having 9 fixed points. The constraints placed on the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are consistent with the existence of 9 fixed points. It has been shown that such polynomials can be constructed (for example, in the context of the International Mathematics Competition for University Students 2013, Problem 7), although the explicit construction is complex. By choosing appropriate coefficients for the polynomials $f$ and $g$, one can create a function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ that has enough \"wiggles\" to intersect the line $y=x$ at 9 distinct points, while still maintaining the condition that $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) > 0$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
