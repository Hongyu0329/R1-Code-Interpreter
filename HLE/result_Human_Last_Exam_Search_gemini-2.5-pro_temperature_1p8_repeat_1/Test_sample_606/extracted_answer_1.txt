N_eff would either increase or decrease depending on the specific properties of the decaying particle and its interactions. However, a key finding is that N_eff can decrease, even if the particle decays solely into neutrinos, due to the transfer of energy from the high-energy neutrinos to the electromagnetic plasma during thermalization.
