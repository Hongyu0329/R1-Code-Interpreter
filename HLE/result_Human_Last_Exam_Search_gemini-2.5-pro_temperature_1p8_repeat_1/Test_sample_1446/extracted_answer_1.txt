The value of the critical exponent ν is not a single constant but depends on the universality class of the system, which is determined by the spatial dimension (d) and the symmetry of the order parameter (N). For d > 4, ν = 1/2. At d = 4, ν = 1/2 with logarithmic corrections to scaling. For d = 3, ν ≈ 0.630 for the Ising class (N=1), ν ≈ 0.671 for the XY class (N=2), and ν ≈ 0.711 for the Heisenberg class (N=3). For d = 2, ν = 1 for the Ising class (N=1).
