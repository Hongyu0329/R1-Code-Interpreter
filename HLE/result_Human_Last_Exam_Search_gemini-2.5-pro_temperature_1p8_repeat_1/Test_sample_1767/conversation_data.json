    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction, considered as a single system, is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This is based on the principle of the additivity of the Chern number, a topological invariant that characterizes these materials.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material that exhibits a quantized Hall conductance in the absence of an external magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect. This property is described by the Chern number (C), an integer that quantifies the topology of the electronic band structure. One of the key features of a Chern insulator with a non-zero Chern number is the presence of chiral edge states, which are one-dimensional conducting channels that exist at the boundary of the material. The number of these chiral edge states is equal to the absolute value of the Chern number.\n\nThe additivity of the Chern number is a fundamental property. When two topological systems are combined, the topological invariant of the composite system is the sum of the invariants of the individual components. In this case, with two Chern insulators each having C=1, the total Chern number of the combined system is:\n\nC_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThis means the combined system will behave as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 2, hosting two chiral edge states on its exterior boundaries. The interface where the two insulators are joined would not have net chiral edge modes, as the number of modes at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers C1 and C2 is given by the difference |C1 - C2|, which in this case is |1 - 1| = 0.\n\nIt is worth noting that it is possible for two Chern insulators to have the same Chern number but still be topologically distinct in a more subtle way, for instance, due to different arrangements of Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone. Such a junction could host special \"helical\" edge states at the interface. However, this does not alter the fact that the total Chern number of the overall system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
