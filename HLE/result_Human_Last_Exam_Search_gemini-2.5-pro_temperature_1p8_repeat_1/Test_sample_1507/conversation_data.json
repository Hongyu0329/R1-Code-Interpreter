    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of faces of its convex hull. The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, and its convex hull is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles.\n\nThe \"outer-hull\" represents the visible exterior of the shape, which is defined by its convex hull. The faces of the regular icosahedron are already triangles, so no further subdivision is necessary to achieve a triangulation. Therefore, the number of visible triangles from the outside is simply the number of faces on the regular icosahedron.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
