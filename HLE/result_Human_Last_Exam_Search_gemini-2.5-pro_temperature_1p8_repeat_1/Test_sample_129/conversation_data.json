    "Answering this question requires carefully enumerating all syntactically valid boolean expressions that can be formed using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, and then counting how many of these expressions evaluate to True. The precedence of operators is given as ! > & > |, and we'll assume left-to-right associativity for operators with the same precedence, which is a standard convention.\n\nFirst, let's identify the possible structures of a 5-symbol expression that are syntactically valid. The symbols are T (True), F (False), ! (NOT), & (AND), | (OR), ( (left parenthesis), and ) (right parenthesis).\n\nThe valid structures and the number of true expressions for each are as follows:\n\n### 1. Three Operands and Two Operators\nThis structure is of the form `A op1 B op2 C`, where A, B, and C are placeholders for T or F, and op1 and op2 are binary operators. This uses 5 symbols. The evaluation depends on the precedence of the operators.\n\n*   **`A & B & C`**: This is parsed as `(A & B) & C`. The expression is true only if all operands are true.\n    *   `T & T & T` (1 true expression)\n*   **`A | B | C`**: This is parsed as `(A | B) | C`. The expression is false only if all operands are false. Out of 2Â³ = 8 combinations, 7 are true.\n    *   All combinations except `F | F | F` (7 true expressions)\n*   **`A & B | C`**: Parsed as `(A & B) | C`. This is true if C is true (4 combinations) or if C is false and `A & B` is true (1 combination: `T & T & F`).\n    *   `T&T|T`, `T&T|F`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T` (5 true expressions)\n*   **`A | B & C`**: Parsed as `A | (B & C)`. This is true if A is true (4 combinations) or if A is false and `B & C` is true (1 combination: `F | T & T`).\n    *   `T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `F|T&T` (5 true expressions)\n\nTotal for this category: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18.\n\n### 2. Parenthesized Binary Operations\nThis structure has the form `(A op B)`, consisting of 5 symbols: `(`, `A`, `op`, `B`, `)`.\n\n*   **`(A & B)`**: True only for `(T & T)`. (1 true expression)\n*   **`(A | B)`**: True for all cases except `(F | F)`.\n    *   `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, `(F | T)` (3 true expressions)\n\nTotal for this category: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n### 3. Expressions with the NOT Operator (!)\nSeveral valid 5-symbol structures can be formed using the `!` operator.\n\n*   **`!A op !B`**: For example, `!T | !F`. This is parsed as `(!A) op (!B)`.\n    *   `!A & !B`: True only for `!F & !F`, which is `T & T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!A | !B`: True for `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F`. (3 true expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n*   **`!!A op B`**: For example, `!!T & F`. This is parsed as `(!(!A)) op B`.\n    *   `!!A & B`: True only for `!!T & T`, which is `T & T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!!A | B`: True for `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, and `!!F|T`. (3 true expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n*   **`A op !!B`**: This is symmetric to the previous structure.\n    *   `A & !!B`: True only for `T & !!T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `A | !!B`: True for `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, and `F|!!T`. (3 true expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n*   **Unary negation sequences**:\n    *   `!!!!A`: The string `!!!!T` (5 symbols) parses as `!(!(!(!T)))` which evaluates to T. `!!!!F` evaluates to F. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!!(A)`: The string `!!(T)` (5 symbols) parses as `!(!((T)))`, which is T. `!!(F)` is F. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!(!A)`: The string `!(!T)` (5 symbols) parses as `!((!T))`, which is T. `!(!F)` is F. (1 true expression)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming the counts from all categories:\n*   Three Operands: 18\n*   Parenthesized Binary Operations: 4\n*   `!A op !B`: 4\n*   `!!A op B`: 4\n*   `A op !!B`: 4\n*   Unary Negation Sequences: 3\n\nTotal = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 37.\n\nThere are 37 distinct true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols.\n\n<<<37>>>"
