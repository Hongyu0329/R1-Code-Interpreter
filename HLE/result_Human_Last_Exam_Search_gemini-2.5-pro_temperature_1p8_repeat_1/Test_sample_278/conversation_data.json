    "To determine the area of the smallest square that can outcircle the given figure, we first need to understand the shape of the curve and then find its bounding box.\n\nThe parametric curve is defined in two parts:\n*   For the interval $t\\in[0,\\pi]$, the equations are $x=\\cos t$ and $y=\\sin t$. This represents the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin, as the y-values are non-negative.\n*   For the interval $t\\in(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the equations are $x=\\cos t$ and $y=5\\sin t$. This describes the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis, as the y-values are negative.\n\nNext, we find the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates to determine the bounding box of the entire figure.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:** The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire range of $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The maximum value of $\\cos t$ is 1, and the minimum value is -1. Therefore, the width of the figure is from -1 to 1.\n*   **Y-coordinates:**\n    *   In the first interval $t\\in[0,\\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$. The values of y range from 0 to 1.\n    *   In the second interval $t\\in(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin t$. Since $\\sin t$ ranges from -1 to 0 in this interval, the values of y range from -5 to 0.\n    *   Combining both intervals, the total range for the y-coordinate is from -5 to 1.\n\nThe total width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values: $1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe total height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values: $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest square that can circumscribe this figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the figure's width and height. In this case, the side length of the square will be $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nFinally, the area of this square is the side length squared.\nArea = $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
