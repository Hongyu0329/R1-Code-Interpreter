    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a fixed value; it depends on the specific atom being considered. The notation \"6-311G**\" provides instructions on how to construct the basis set for any given atom, which in turn determines the total count of primitive Gaussians.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what each part of the 6-311G** notation means and how to calculate the number of primitive Gaussians for different types of atoms:\n\n*   **6-**: This indicates that each core atomic orbital is described by a single contracted function, which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **-311G**: This part describes the valence atomic orbitals. They are represented by three separate contracted functions, making it a \"triple-zeta\" valence basis set.\n    *   The first number, **3**, means the first contracted function is composed of **3** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The next two numbers, **1** and **1**, mean that the second and third contracted functions are each composed of a single (**1**) primitive Gaussian. In Pople-style basis sets, the s and p valence orbitals share these primitive Gaussians.\n\n*   **\\***: The first asterisk signifies that a single set of d-type polarization functions is added to \"heavy\" atoms (i.e., all atoms other than hydrogen and helium). This typically consists of a single primitive Gaussian for each of the six Cartesian d-orbitals (d<sub>x²</sub>, d<sub>y²</sub>, d<sub>z²</sub>, d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>), adding **6** primitive functions.\n\n*   **\\*\\***: The second asterisk indicates that a single set of p-type polarization functions is added to \"light\" atoms (hydrogen and helium). This consists of a single primitive Gaussian for each of the three p-orbitals (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>), adding **3** primitive functions.\n\n### Calculation for Specific Atoms\n\nBased on these rules, we can calculate the number of primitive Gaussians for specific atoms.\n\n**For a heavy atom (e.g., Carbon):**\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** These share primitive sets, so there is one set of 3 primitives, one set of 1 primitive, and another set of 1 primitive for the entire valence shell. This gives a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\*):** 6 d-type primitive Gaussians are added.\n\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for a carbon atom in a 6-311G** basis set is:\n6 (core) + 5 (valence) + 6 (polarization) = **17 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n**For a hydrogen atom:**\n\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital, described by 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\*\\*):** 3 p-type primitive Gaussians are added.\n\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for a hydrogen atom in a 6-311G** basis set is:\n5 (valence) + 3 (polarization) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom. For a heavy atom like Carbon, there are 17 primitive Gaussians. For a Hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
