    "The word encoded in the `verbatim` block is **BITBLT**.\n\nThis is a classic visual puzzle where the letters 't' and 'b' themselves form the shapes of the letters in the answer. In this type of puzzle, one letter (in this case, 'b') is treated as the \"ink\" or filled-in part of the image, while the other letter ('t') represents the background or transparent space. The `verbatim` environment in LaTeX preserves the monospaced layout, which is crucial for the correct visual representation of the word.\n\nThe word itself, \"BITBLT,\" is a term from computer graphics that stands for \"bit block transfer.\" This is an operation that involves moving a block of bits (a bitmap or image) from one location in computer memory to another. The nature of the puzzle, being a bitmap representation of a word, is a direct clue to the answer itself.\n\nWhen rendered on a grid, the 'b' characters form the uppercase letters B, I, T, B, L, and T.\n\n"
