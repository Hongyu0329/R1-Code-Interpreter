The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are found by first determining the equilibrium distribution of photons using the principles of large deviation theory. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems establish that the most probable macroscopic state, corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium, is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function. This minimization, subject to the constraint of constant total energy, yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.

From this distribution, the mean energy is calculated by integrating the product of the energy of each mode and the average number of photons in that mode, which results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law where the mean energy is proportional to T⁴.

The entropy, representing the uncertainty of the microscopic state, is also derived from the Bose-Einstein distribution and is found to be proportional to T³.
