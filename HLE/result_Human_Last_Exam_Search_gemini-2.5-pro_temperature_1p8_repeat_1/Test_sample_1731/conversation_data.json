    "I have performed an initial search to understand the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. The results provide a good overview of these theorems, explaining that they both bound the probability of an empirical average being far from its mean. They are particularly relevant to statistical mechanics as they provide a rigorous foundation for Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of entropy.\n\nHowever, the initial search did not provide specific details on how these theorems are applied to the Bose case of light quanta (photons) to derive the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy. While there are mentions of the connection between these theorems and statistical mechanics in general, and even a specific mention of applying them to photons, the actual derivation and the resulting equilibrium values are not detailed.\n\nTherefore, I need to perform more targeted searches to bridge this gap. My next steps will focus on finding the specific application of these theorems to the photon case and the resulting expressions for entropy and mean energy. After that, I will proceed to determine the final answer as requested.\n\nUpdated plan:\nSearch for the application of large deviation theorems (Boltzmann-Sanov, Cramer-Chernoff) to derive the statistical properties of a photon gas (Bose-Einstein statistics).\nInvestigate how these theorems lead to the equilibrium distribution for photons.\nFrom the equilibrium distribution, find the expressions for the mean energy and entropy of the photon gas.\nSynthesize the information to provide the final answer for the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta.The recent search results have been very fruitful. Specifically, the papers on \"Large Deviation Theory for Bose Gas of Photons and Planck's Oscillators\" directly address the user's question. They explicitly state that by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems, one can calculate the large deviation probabilities, entropies, and rate functions for the spatial and energy distributions of photons. These papers confirm that this approach reproduces the results of Bose and Planck.\n\nFurthermore, the search results provide context on how large deviation theory is connected to statistical mechanics and the derivation of Planck's law. They explain that the equilibrium state corresponds to the most probable macrostate, which can be determined by minimizing a rate function or maximizing entropy, concepts central to large deviation theory.\n\nI now have a clear path to answer the user's question. The next logical step is to synthesize the information from these sources to explain how the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta are found using the mentioned theorems. No further searches are required.\n\n## Equilibrium Properties of Light Quanta: A Large Deviation Perspective\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a gas of light quanta, obeying Bose-Einstein statistics, can be determined using the powerful mathematical frameworks of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff large deviation theorems. These theorems provide a rigorous foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics, formalizing the idea that the equilibrium state of a system is its most probable macroscopic state.\n\nThe application of large deviation theory to a photon gas essentially reproduces the celebrated results of Bose and Planck from a probabilistic standpoint. The core idea is to consider the macroscopic properties of the system, such as its energy distribution, as empirical averages of microscopic random variables. The large deviation theorems then quantify the probability of observing a macroscopic state that deviates from the true expectation.\n\n### Finding the Equilibrium Distribution\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is particularly suited for analyzing the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. In the context of a photon gas, we can consider the energy levels to be discrete and the number of photons in each level to be a random variable. The theorem states that the probability of observing a particular distribution of photons across these energy levels decreases exponentially with the number of photons, and the rate of this decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the observed distribution and the true underlying distribution.\n\nAt thermal equilibrium, the system will be found in the most probable macroscopic state, which corresponds to the distribution that minimizes this rate function, subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy. This minimization procedure, often carried out using the method of Lagrange multipliers, leads to the well-known Bose-Einstein distribution for the average number of photons in an energy state ε:\n\n```\nn(ε) = 1 / (exp(ε / k_B T) - 1)\n```\n\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature. This distribution characterizes the equilibrium state of the photon gas.\n\nThe Cramér-Chernoff theorem, on the other hand, deals with the probability of large deviations of the sum of independent random variables from their mean. When applied to the total energy of the photon gas, which is the sum of the energies of individual photons, this theorem provides an alternative and complementary way to arrive at the same equilibrium conditions.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy and Entropy\n\nOnce the equilibrium distribution is established, the macroscopic thermodynamic quantities can be calculated.\n\nThe **mean energy** (`<E>`) of the photon gas is found by integrating the energy of each state multiplied by the average number of photons in that state over all possible frequencies (or energies), and also considering the density of states. For a black-body cavity of volume V, this leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the total energy is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature:\n\n```\n<E> ∝ V * T^4\n```\nThe exact expression for the mean energy density (energy per unit volume) as a function of frequency ν and temperature T is given by Planck's law:\n```\nu(ν, T) = (8πhν^3 / c^3) * (1 / (exp(hν / k_B T) - 1))\n```\nwhere `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe **entropy** (`S`) of the photon gas at equilibrium can also be derived from the Bose-Einstein distribution. It is a measure of the statistical uncertainty or the number of microscopic configurations that correspond to the equilibrium macroscopic state. For a photon gas, the entropy is found to be proportional to the third power of the temperature and the volume:\n\n```\nS ∝ V * T^3\n```\nThis result is consistent with the thermodynamic relations for a system where the chemical potential is zero, as is the case for a photon gas in thermal equilibrium.\n\nIn essence, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems provide the mathematical machinery to rigorously justify the foundational assumption of statistical mechanics: that the system will be found in its most probable state. By applying these theorems to the Bose case of light quanta, one can derive the equilibrium distribution and subsequently the expressions for mean energy and entropy that are in perfect agreement with the established laws of black-body radiation.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are found by first determining the equilibrium distribution of photons using the principles of large deviation theory. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems establish that the most probable macroscopic state, corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium, is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function. This minimization, subject to the constraint of constant total energy, yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n\nFrom this distribution, the mean energy is calculated by integrating the product of the energy of each mode and the average number of photons in that mode, which results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law where the mean energy is proportional to T⁴.\n\nThe entropy, representing the uncertainty of the microscopic state, is also derived from the Bose-Einstein distribution and is found to be proportional to T³.>>>"
