    "The number of involutions in a finite group is the sum of the sizes of all conjugacy classes of elements of order 2. For the projective special unitary group PSU(4,q), where q is an odd prime power, the number of conjugacy classes of involutions depends on the value of q modulo 8.\n\nThe user is asking for the number of involutions in PSU(4,997). Here, q = 997.\nFirst, we determine the class of q:\n997 mod 8 = 5.\nAccording to the literature on the structure of finite unitary groups, for cases where `q â‰¡ 1` or `5 \\pmod 8`, the group PSU(4,q) has two distinct conjugacy classes of involutions. We can refer to these as the \"non-central\" and \"central\" types, based on the location of the involution within a Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nThe number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes. The size of a conjugacy class of an element `t` in a group `G` is given by the formula `|G| / |C_G(t)|`, where `|G|` is the order of the group and `|C_G(t)|` is the order of the centralizer of `t` in `G`.\n\n1.  **Order of the group G = PSU(4,997):**\n    The order of PSU(n,q) is given by the formula: `|PSU(n,q)| = (1/d) * q^(n(n-1)/2) * Product_{i=2 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`, where `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    For G = PSU(4,997):\n    `n = 4`, `q = 997`.\n    `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    `|G| = (1/2) * 997^6 * (997^2 - 1) * (997^3 + 1) * (997^4 - 1)`.\n\n2.  **The two classes of involutions and their centralizers:**\n\n    *   **Non-central involutions (t_n):** The centralizer `C_G(t_n)` is isomorphic to `PGL(2, q^2)`. The order is `|PGL(2, q^2)| = q^2(q^4 - 1)`.\n        The number of non-central involutions is:\n        `N_n = |G| / |C_G(t_n)| = [q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)/d] / [q^2(q^4-1)] = q^4(q^2-1)(q^3+1)/d`.\n        For q=997 and d=2:\n        `N_n = 997^4 * (997^2-1) * (997^3+1) / 2`.\n\n    *   **Central involutions (t_c):** The centralizer `C_G(t_c)` has a more complex structure, related to `SL(2,q) x SL(2,q)`. The order of the centralizer is `|C_G(t_c)| = q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)^3/d`. However, a more accepted formula from the literature gives the order of the centralizer of a central involution as `q^4 * (q-1)^2 * (q+1)^2 / d`, which simplifies to `(q * |SL(2,q)|)^2/d`. A derived size of the conjugacy class is `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n        Let's use this size for the number of central involutions:\n        `N_c = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n3.  **Total number of involutions:**\n    The total number of involutions is `I = N_n + N_c`.\n    `I = q^4(q^2-1)(q^3+1)/d + q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n    Let's substitute `q^3+1 = (q+1)(q^2-q+1)`:\n    `I = q^4(q^2-1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1)/d + q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n    Factor out `q^4(q^2-q+1)`:\n    `I = q^4(q^2-q+1) * [ (q^2-1)(q+1)/d + (q^2+1) ]`.\n    Substitute `q=997` and `d=2`:\n    `I = 997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * [ (997^2-1)(997+1)/2 + (997^2+1) ]`\n    `I = 997^4 * (994009 - 997 + 1) * [ (994008)(998)/2 + (994009+1) ]`\n    `I = 997^4 * (993013) * [ 994008 * 499 + 994010 ]`\n    `I = 997^4 * (993013) * [ 496019992 + 994010 ]`\n    `I = 997^4 * (993013) * [ 497014002 ]`\n    `I = 988051788016 * 993013 * 497014002`\n    `I = 981146313337905008 * 497014002`\n    `I = 487649557723788734976016016`\n\n"
