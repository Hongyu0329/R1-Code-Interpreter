    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe apparent changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth and alterations in the natural world due to the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo** (354-430 AD).\n\nAugustine's key contribution was the concept of ***rationes seminales***, which can be translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"seedlike principles.\" This framework allowed him to explain events that seemingly contradicted the normal course of nature without suggesting that God arbitrarily violated His own established order.\n\nHere is how Augustine's terminology applies to both scenarios:\n*   **A Broader Definition of Nature:** Augustine argued that what we perceive as a miracle is not actually contrary to nature as God created it, but only \"contrary to what we know of nature\" (*non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura*). He proposed that God's will is the ultimate \"nature\" of every created thing.\n*   ***Rationes Seminales***: This is the core of his specialized terminology. Augustine theorized that at the initial creation, God embedded \"seminal reasons\" or latent potentialities into the fabric of the world. These are not fully formed things but principles that can develop and emerge at a later time when circumstances are right, according to God's providential plan.\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth of Jesus, in this view, was not a sudden violation of natural law. Instead, it was the activation of a potential—a *ratio seminalis*—that God had placed within creation from the very beginning. It was an extraordinary event, but one that unfolded from a pre-ordained capacity within God's comprehensive natural order.\n*   **Application to the Fall:** Similarly, the changes in the natural world after the Fall of Man—such as the appearance of thorns and thistles or the pain of childbirth—can be understood as the coming to fruition of negative potentialities that were part of God's contingent plan. These harmful aspects of nature were not part of the original, pristine state of the world but were \"activated\" as a consequence of human sin, again demonstrating a change in the operation of nature based on these embedded principles.\n\nBy developing this concept, Augustine created a sophisticated theological framework to discuss miracles and shifts in the natural order not as interruptions of law, but as the unfolding of a deeper, more complex set of rules established by God at creation.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
