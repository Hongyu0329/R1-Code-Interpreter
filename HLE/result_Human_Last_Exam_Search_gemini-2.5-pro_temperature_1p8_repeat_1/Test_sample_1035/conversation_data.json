    "The search results point to a key theorem by G. W. Peck, which is a generalization of the Graham-Pollak theorem. The Graham-Pollak theorem states that at least $n-1$ complete bipartite subgraphs are needed to partition the edges of $K_n$. However, the user's question is about the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of $K_n$, not the number of such graphs.\n\nSeveral sources confirm a result that directly addresses the user's question. A result by Hansel, and later refined by Katona and Szemer√©di, and then by Peck, states that if a family of bipartite graphs $\\{H_1, ..., H_m\\}$ covers all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$, then the sum of the number of vertices of these bipartite graphs is at least $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. More formally, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} |V(H_i)| \\ge n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. The problem statement uses the term \"covering,\" which means the union of the edges of the bipartite graphs contains all the edges of $K_n$. This is consistent with the theorem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, to answer the question for $n=35$, I need to calculate $35 \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\n\nFirst, I will calculate the value of $\\log_2 35$:\n$2^5 = 32$\n$2^6 = 64$\n\nSince $32 < 35 < 64$, we have $5 < \\log_2 35 < 6$.\n\nNext, I will find the ceiling of $\\log_2 35$:\n$\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n\nFinally, I will multiply this value by $n=35$:\n$35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$ is 210.\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$, where $n = 35$.\n\nA result in graph theory by G. W. Peck provides the answer to this question. The theorem states that for a family of bipartite graphs to cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$, the sum of the number of vertices of these bipartite graphs must be at least $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\nFor the given problem, $n = 35$. We first need to calculate $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\nWe know that:\n$2^5 = 32$\n$2^6 = 64$\n\nSince $32 < 35 < 64$, the value of $\\log_2 35$ is between 5 and 6. Therefore, the ceiling of $\\log_2 35$ is 6.\n$\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum number of vertices:\nMinimum number of vertices = $35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$ is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
