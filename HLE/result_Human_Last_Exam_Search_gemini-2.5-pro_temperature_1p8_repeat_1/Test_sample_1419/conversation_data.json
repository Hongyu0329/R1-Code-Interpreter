    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the renormalization group flow of the coupling constant `u` has a non-trivial fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The beta function, which describes the change of the coupling with the length scale, is given to the lowest order by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + b u²\n\nwhere `b` is a positive constant that depends on the normalization of the coupling and the number of field components (N). For the single-component (N=1) real scalar field, this constant `b` arises from the one-loop calculation.\n\nThe fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is found by setting the beta function to zero:\n\nβ(u*) = 0\n-ϵu* + b (u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0, and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. For the non-trivial solution, we have:\n\nu* = ϵ / b\n\nThe constant `b` depends on the specific conventions used for the coupling in the Lagrangian. If the interaction term in the Lagrangian density is defined as (λ/4!)ϕ⁴, and the beta function is calculated for the coupling λ, the fixed point is typically found to be:\n\nλ* = (8π²/3) ϵ\n\nIf a different normalization for the coupling is used, for example u = λ/(16π²), then:\n\nu* = ϵ / 6\n\nIn the O(N) model, for a scalar field with N components, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `g*` is:\n\ng* = [6/(N+8)] ϵ\n\nFor the single component ϕ⁴ theory (N=1), this gives:\n\ng* = (2/3) ϵ\n\nTherefore, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is directly proportional to ϵ.\n\n<<<u* ∝ ϵ>>>"
