    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8), the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is determined by summing the functions for each atom in the molecule.\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 9 contracted Gaussian functions. This consists of one function for the 1s core orbital and a split-valence representation for the 2s and 2p orbitals (four inner and four outer valence functions).\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 2 contracted Gaussian functions. Since hydrogen has no core electrons, its 1s valence orbital is split into an inner and an outer function.\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, meaning it contains 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n*   7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total = 63 + 16 = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.**\n\n<<<79>>>"
