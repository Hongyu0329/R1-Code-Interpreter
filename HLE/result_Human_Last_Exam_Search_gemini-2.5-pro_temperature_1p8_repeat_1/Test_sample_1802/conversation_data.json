    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel \\(\\Lambda\\) acting on a \\(d\\)-dimensional qudit system, we need to follow a few key steps in quantum information theory.\n\n### 1. The Pauli Channel\n\nA Pauli channel \\(\\Lambda\\) acting on a \\(d\\)-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is a quantum channel that can be expressed in the form:\n\\[\n\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\rho\\) is the \\(d \\times d\\) density matrix of the qudit.\n*   \\(\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}\\) are the generalized Pauli operators for a \\(d\\)-dimensional system. These operators are unitary and form an orthonormal basis for the space of \\(d \\times d\\) matrices.\n*   The coefficients \\(\\{p_k\\}\\) are probabilities, meaning \\(p_k \\ge 0\\) and \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1\\).\n\nThe operators \\(K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k\\) are a set of Kraus operators for the channel \\(\\Lambda\\), as they satisfy the trace-preserving condition \\(\\sum_k K_k^\\dagger K_k = \\sum_k p_k U_k^\\dagger U_k = \\sum_k p_k I = I\\).\n\n### 2. The Rank of a Quantum Channel\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as its Choi rank. This is the rank of the channel's Choi matrix and corresponds to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to describe the channel. For a Pauli channel, the generalized Pauli operators are orthogonal. This orthogonality implies that the minimal number of Kraus operators is simply the number of non-zero coefficients \\(p_k\\).\n\n### 3. The Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\nGiven a channel \\(\\Lambda\\) with Kraus operators \\(\\{K_k\\}\\), the complementary channel \\(\\Lambda^c\\) describes the information that leaks to the environment. The output of the complementary channel for an input state \\(\\rho\\) is an operator on the environment's Hilbert space whose matrix representation is given by:\n\\[\n(\\Lambda^c(\\rho))_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho K_j^\\dagger K_i)\n\\]\nThe rank of the complementary channel, \\(\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c)\\), is the Choi rank of this channel \\(\\Lambda^c\\). A fundamental result in quantum channel theory states that the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the dimension of the vector space spanned by the Kraus operators of the original channel.\n\\[\n\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{K_k\\})\n\\]\n### 4. Calculating the Maximal Rank\n\nFor a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are \\(K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k\\). Therefore, the rank of its complementary channel is:\n\\[\n\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{\\sqrt{p_k} U_k \\mid p_k > 0\\})\n\\]\nThe generalized Pauli operators \\(\\{U_k\\}\\) are constructed to be linearly independent; they form a basis for the entire space of \\(d \\times d\\) matrices. As a result, the dimension of the span of a subset of these operators is simply the number of operators in that subset. This means the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities \\(p_k\\) in the definition of the Pauli channel.\n\nTo find the *maximal* rank, we need to consider a Pauli channel where the number of non-zero \\(p_k\\) is maximized. The total number of generalized Pauli operators for a \\(d\\)-dimensional system is \\(d^2\\). It is possible to define a valid Pauli channel where all \\(d^2\\) probabilities \\(p_k\\) are greater than zero. A prime example of this is the depolarizing channel for certain parameter ranges.\n\nFor such a channel, there are \\(d^2\\) non-zero Kraus operators \\(\\{\\sqrt{p_k}U_k\\}\\), and since the \\(\\{U_k\\}\\) are linearly independent, the dimension of their span is \\(d^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel acting on a \\(d\\)-dimensional qudit system is \\(d^2\\).\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
