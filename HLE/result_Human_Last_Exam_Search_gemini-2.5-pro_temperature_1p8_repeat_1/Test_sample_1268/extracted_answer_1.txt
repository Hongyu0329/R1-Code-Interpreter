In summary, while the notation $k_{k,\infty}$ is non-standard, interpreting it as the norm of generators for the associated arithmetic group leads to results that provide an upper bound as a power function of the covolume $V$. This bound, however, also depends on the spectral gap of the hyperbolic surface. Specifically, for a cocompact arithmetic Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ with covolume $V = \text{vol}(SL_2(\mathbb{R})/\Gamma)$, there exists a set of generators where the norm of each generator is bounded above by a quantity dependent on $V$. A notable result gives a bound that is a power of the covolume, although the exact expression involves the spectral gap of the surface. The covolume $V$ itself is directly related to the squarefree number $N$ by the formula $V = \frac{\pi}{3} \prod_{p|N} (p-1)$.
