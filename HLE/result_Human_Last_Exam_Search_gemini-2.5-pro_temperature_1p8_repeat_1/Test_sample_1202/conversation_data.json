    "After a gene is duplicated, it becomes redundant. Without selective pressure to maintain both copies, one is likely to accumulate mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as pseudogenization. This is considered the most common fate for duplicate genes. However, for a duplicate gene to be retained and diverge in function, other mechanisms must be at play.\n\nThe main theories explaining the long-term retention and functional divergence of duplicated genes are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** occurs when one copy of the duplicated gene acquires a novel, beneficial function through mutation, while the other copy retains the original function. This process is driven by positive selection, but it relies on the occurrence of a rare beneficial mutation before one copy is silenced.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** proposes that the two gene copies partition the ancestral functions. This can happen if the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., expressed in different tissues or at different times). Following duplication, each copy can accumulate degenerative mutations in different subfunctions, making both copies necessary to carry out the full range of the original gene's functions. This is often referred to as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. Because this process can occur through more common neutral or slightly deleterious mutations, it is considered a frequent mechanism for preserving duplicate genes from being lost.\n\nLet's evaluate the given choices:\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that tends to homogenize the sequences of duplicated genes, thus working against their divergence.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This leads to the loss of function in one gene copy. While the pseudogene is retained in the genome, this represents a failure to retain two functional, diverged genes. It is the most frequent outcome overall, but not the mechanism for functional retention and divergence.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This is a valid and important mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes, leading to evolutionary novelty.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This is also a key mechanism for retention and divergence. Many evolutionary biologists argue it is a more likely initial fate for duplicated genes than neofunctionalization because it doesn't require a rare beneficial mutation to preserve both copies. The process can be driven by more common degenerative mutations. Some models even suggest subfunctionalization acts as a transitional state that saves a duplicate from extinction, allowing it to later neofunctionalize.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary term describing the rapid diversification of species to fill different ecological niches and is not a mechanism of molecular evolution within a genome.\n\nComparing neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, several studies suggest that subfunctionalization provides a more common pathway for the initial preservation of duplicated genes, as it relies on more frequent neutral mutation events rather than rare beneficial ones. Therefore, it is arguably the most likely mechanism to rescue a duplicated gene from being lost to pseudogenization, thus being responsible for its retention and subsequent divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
