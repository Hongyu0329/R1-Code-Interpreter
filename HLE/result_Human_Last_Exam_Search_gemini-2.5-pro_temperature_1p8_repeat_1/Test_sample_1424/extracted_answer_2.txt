In the frequency-wavevector domain, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ is given by G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη), where ω is the frequency and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term that correctly positions the pole of the function relative to the real axis.
