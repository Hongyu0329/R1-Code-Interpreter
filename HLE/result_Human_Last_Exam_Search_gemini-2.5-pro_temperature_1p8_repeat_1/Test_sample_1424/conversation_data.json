    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the Green's function provides the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another. The *bare* Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes this propagation in a system of non-interacting particles. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ, is most clearly seen in the energy-momentum (or frequency-wavevector) representation.\n\nFor a system of non-interacting fermions, the bare Green's function G₀ is diagonal in the basis of the single-particle Hamiltonian's eigenstates, which are labeled by the wavevector 'k'. In the frequency (ω) and wavevector (k) space, the bare Green's function takes the form:\n\n<br>\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη)***\n<br>\n\nHere:\n*   **ω** represents the frequency (or energy) of the particle.\n*   **ϵₖ** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue corresponding to the wavevector **k**. This is the energy of a particle in the state |k⟩.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimally small imaginary term that ensures the correct time-ordering in the Fourier transform and dictates the analytic properties of the Green's function. The sign of η depends on whether the state 'k' is occupied (part of the Fermi sea) or unoccupied.\n\nSpecifically, for a more complete picture at zero temperature, the expression can be written as:\n\n<br>\n***G₀(k, ω) = (1 - nₖ) / (ω - ϵₖ + iη) + nₖ / (ω - ϵₖ - iη)***\n<br>\n\nwhere:\n*   **nₖ** is the occupation number of the single-particle state k. It is 1 if the state is occupied (ϵₖ is below the Fermi energy) and 0 if it is unoccupied (ϵₖ is above the Fermi energy).\n*   **η** is a small positive infinitesimal.\n\nThe first term corresponds to the propagation of a particle into an unoccupied state (an electron), with its pole slightly below the real axis. The second term describes the propagation of a hole created by removing a particle from an occupied state, with its pole slightly above the real axis. For many purposes, the simpler form is used, with the understanding that the sign of iη is chosen appropriately.\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ is that of an inverse linear relationship in frequency, with poles located at the single-particle energies themselves. This simple pole structure is a defining characteristic of a non-interacting system and forms the foundation for diagrammatic perturbation theory, where interactions are introduced via the self-energy in the Dyson equation.\n\n<<<In the frequency-wavevector domain, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ is given by G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη), where ω is the frequency and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term that correctly positions the pole of the function relative to the real axis.>>>"
