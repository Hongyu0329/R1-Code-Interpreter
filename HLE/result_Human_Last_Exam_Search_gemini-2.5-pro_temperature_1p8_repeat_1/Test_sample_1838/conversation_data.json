    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to determine all the pixels that make up the line.\n\n**1. Initialization**\n*   Start point: (x1, y1) = (1, 1)\n*   End point: (x2, y2) = (11, 5)\n*   Calculate the change in x and y:\n    *   Δx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n**2. Decision Parameter**\nThe initial decision parameter, p, is calculated as: p = 2 * Δy - Δx.\n*   p = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n**3. Generating the Pixels**\nSince the slope (Δy/Δx = 0.4) is less than 1, we will increment x by 1 at each step and use the decision parameter to determine when to increment y. The starting pixel is (1, 1). The algorithm will iterate until x reaches 11.\n\nThe pixels generated along the line are:\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   **(6, 3)**\n*   (7, 3)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 4)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\n**4. Central Pixel**\nThe algorithm generates a total of 11 pixels. The central pixel is the 6th pixel in this sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the 6th pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<(6, 3)>>>"
