    "Based on established results in homotopy theory, specifically the work of Jie Wu on the homotopy of suspensions of loop spaces, the connectivity of the map in question can be determined.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Map and Spaces\n\nThe map in question is:\n$f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n\nLet's break down the spaces involved:\n*   **S<sup>n</sup>**: This represents the n-dimensional sphere.\n*   **ΩX**: This denotes the loop space of a topological space X. The homotopy groups of a loop space are related to the original space by the formula π<sub>i</sub>(ΩX) = π<sub>i+1</sub>(X).\n*   **ΣX**: This is the reduced suspension of X. The suspension operation generally increases the connectivity of a space by one.\n*   **∧**: This is the smash product of two pointed topological spaces. Notably, the smash product of two spheres S<sup>m</sup> and S<sup>n</sup> is homotopy equivalent to S<sup>m+n</sup>.\n\nUsing these definitions, we can re-express the spaces:\n*   The loop spaces ΩS<sup>4</sup> and ΩS<sup>6</sup> are homotopy equivalent to ΩΣS<sup>3</sup> and ΩΣS<sup>5</sup>, respectively.\n*   The target space is Ω(S<sup>4</sup> ∧ S<sup>6</sup>), which is homotopy equivalent to Ω(S<sup>10</sup>).\n\nThe map is a specific instance of a more general map studied in homotopy theory, often called the Samelson product map or James-Hopf invariant map, which can be expressed as:\n$S: \\Sigma(\\Omega\\Sigma X_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\Omega\\Sigma X_k) \\to \\Omega\\Sigma(X_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge X_k)$\n\nIn this particular problem, we have k=2, X<sub>1</sub> = S<sup>3</sup>, and X<sub>2</sub> = S<sup>5</sup>.\n\n### 2. Connectivity of the Spaces\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is determined by the dimension up to which it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups. To understand this, we first find the connectivity of the source and target spaces. A space is *k*-connected if all its homotopy groups up to and including dimension *k* are trivial.\n\n*   **Source Space**: A = Σ(ΩS<sup>4</sup> ∧ ΩS<sup>6</sup>)\n    *   S<sup>4</sup> is 3-connected. Thus, ΩS<sup>4</sup> is 2-connected (since π<sub>i</sub>(ΩS<sup>4</sup>) = π<sub>i+1</sub>(S<sup>4</sup>)).\n    *   S<sup>6</sup> is 5-connected. Thus, ΩS<sup>6</sup> is 4-connected.\n    *   The smash product of a p-connected space and a q-connected space is (p+q+1)-connected. Therefore, ΩS<sup>4</sup> ∧ ΩS<sup>6</sup> is (2 + 4 + 1) = 7-connected.\n    *   Suspension increases connectivity by 1. So, the source space A is (7+1) = **8-connected**.\n\n*   **Target Space**: B = Ω(S<sup>4</sup> ∧ S<sup>6</sup>) ≃ ΩS<sup>10</sup>\n    *   S<sup>10</sup> is 9-connected.\n    *   The loop space operation reduces connectivity by 1. So, the target space B is (9-1) = **8-connected**.\n\nSince both the source and target spaces are 8-connected, the map between them is at least 8-connected. To find the precise connectivity, we must turn to more advanced theorems.\n\n### 3. The Connectivity of the Map\n\nThe connectivity of this specific map has been determined by Jie Wu in his work on the homotopy theory of suspensions of loop spaces. According to this result, for spheres X<sub>i</sub> = S<sup>n<sub>i</sub></sup>, the map S is (m<sub>1</sub> + ... + m<sub>k</sub> + k)-connected, where X<sub>i</sub> is (m<sub>i</sub>-1)-connected.\n\nLet's apply this theorem to the given map:\n*   We have k=2.\n*   For the space S<sup>4</sup> = ΣS<sup>3</sup>, we consider X<sub>1</sub> = S<sup>3</sup>. S<sup>3</sup> is 2-connected, so m<sub>1</sub>-1 = 2, which gives **m<sub>1</sub> = 3**.\n*   For the space S<sup>6</sup> = ΣS<sup>5</sup>, we consider X<sub>2</sub> = S<sup>5</sup>. S<sup>5</sup> is 4-connected, so m<sub>2</sub>-1 = 4, which gives **m<sub>2</sub> = 5**.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, the connectivity is:\nConnectivity = m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub> + k = 3 + 5 + 2 = **10**.\n\nA map is n-connected if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups π<sub>i</sub> for i < n and a surjection on π<sub>n</sub>. Therefore, the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 10-connected.\n\n<<<10>>>"
