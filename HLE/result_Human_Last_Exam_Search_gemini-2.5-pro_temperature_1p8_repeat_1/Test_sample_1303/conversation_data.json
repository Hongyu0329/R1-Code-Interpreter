    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is a compound with the molecular formula C24H29N5O3, which has been investigated as a potential inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro). This enzyme is crucial for the replication and transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with this chemical's target are other inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.\n\nA variety of small molecules have been identified as inhibitors of this viral enzyme through computational and experimental methods. These molecules bind to the main protease, interfering with its function and thus viral replication.\n\nNotable small molecule inhibitors that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease include:\n\n*   **Nirmatrelvir**: An antiviral drug approved for emergency use, often administered with ritonavir to enhance its effect.\n*   **Remdesivir**: An antiviral medication that has been used in the treatment of COVID-19.\n*   **Lopinavir and Ritonavir**: HIV protease inhibitors that have been studied for their potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **GC376**: A covalent antiviral that is a potent inhibitor of Mpro.\n*   **Hypericin and Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside**: These natural compounds have been shown to inhibit Mpro activity.\n*   **Imatinib, Adapalene, and Candesartan cilexetil**: These drugs demonstrated inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell-based assays.\n*   **AF-399/40713777 and AI-942/42301830**: Two non-peptidic inhibitors identified through molecular docking-based virtual screening.\n*   **Myricetin**: A nonpeptidomimetic covalent inhibitor of the main protease.\n*   **Thioester compounds 3w and 3x**: These compounds have shown excellent inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **Disulfiram, IPA-3, and JX-06**: Identified as hit molecules with inhibitory activity.\n*   **SIMR-2418, SIMR-1740, SIMR-1911, and SIMR-2416**: Small molecules identified from a screening that showed inhibitory effects.\n\nThese molecules represent a range of chemical scaffolds that can form protein-ligand interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, the same protein target as the compound represented by CHEMBL4803817.\n\n<<<The small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with the same target as the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 (the SARS-CoV-2 main protease) include Nirmatrelvir, Remdesivir, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, GC376, Hypericin, Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, Imatinib, Adapalene, Candesartan cilexetil, AF-399/40713777, AI-942/42301830, Myricetin, thioester compounds 3w and 3x, Disulfiram, IPA-3, JX-06, SIMR-2418, SIMR-1740, SIMR-1911, and SIMR-2416.>>>"
