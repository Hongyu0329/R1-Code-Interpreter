    "<<<With the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, and constrained to only the epistemic states of \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" two significant problems arise that are separate from Gettier-style cases.\n\n### Problem 1: The Ambiguity of Justification\n\nThe JTB definition asserts that a belief must be \"justified\" to count as knowledge, but it doesn't specify how much or what kind of justification is sufficient. This creates a significant issue:\n\n*   **Vagueness of the Standard:** What constitutes adequate justification is left undefined. If the standard is set too high (e.g., requiring absolute certainty), very few beliefs would qualify as knowledge, leading to skepticism. If the standard is too low, then weakly supported beliefs could be erroneously classified as knowledge. This problem is magnified in a system with only two epistemic states. Without a clear, objective line, the distinction between a \"justified belief\" (and therefore knowledge) and a \"mere belief\" becomes arbitrary.\n\n*   **The Infinite Regress Problem:** For a belief to be justified, it must be supported by other beliefs, which in turn must also be justified, leading to a potential infinite regress of justifications. While philosophical theories like foundationalism and coherentism attempt to solve this, the JTB model itself offers no solution. In a binary system of only Knowledge and Belief, any belief that isn't ultimately grounded would simply be \"Belief,\" making much of what we consider to be reasoned conclusion potentially unjustifiable.\n\n### Problem 2: The All-or-Nothing Nature of Truth\n\nThe JTB framework insists that for a belief to be knowledge, it must be true. This introduces another major problem, especially in a binary \"Knowledge/Belief\" system:\n\n*   **The Problem of Fallibility:** This condition creates a rigid, black-and-white distinction. A belief that is exceptionally well-justified with all available evidence (for instance, a dominant scientific theory of an era) is still relegated to the category of \"mere belief\" if it is later found to be false. The binary system does not allow for a distinction between a highly rational, evidence-based, but ultimately incorrect belief, and a belief that is simply a random guess. Both would be classified simply as \"Belief,\" which fails to capture the significant difference in their epistemic standing.\n\n*   **The Circularity of Ascertaining Truth:** To confirm that a belief is \"true,\" one would seemingly need to already possess knowledge of the matter. This creates a circular dependency. To know that my belief \"it is raining\" is true, I must first know that it is, in fact, raining. This makes the \"truth\" condition somewhat redundant or question-begging within the analysis of knowledge itself.>>>"
