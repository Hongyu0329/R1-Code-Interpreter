    "This question refers to a well-known case of creative license in literary translation, although it conflates two separate famous examples. There is no known instance of an English poet's name appearing in a description of Vienna's boulevards in a Russian translation. The query, however, points to two distinct anecdotes:\n\n1.  In the Russian translation of the English writer G.K. Chesterton's work, the legendary translator Natalia Trauberg rendered the phrase \"as broad as it was long\" into \"широк, как Китс\" (\"wide as Keats\"). John Keats was an English poet. This pun is celebrated in Russian literary circles but does not take place in a description of Vienna.\n2.  In the Russian translation of Austrian writer Stefan Zweig's memoir, \"The World of Yesterday,\" the translator N. Butyrina describes the Vienna Ringstrasse with the phrase \"проспекты, просторные, как Уитмен\" (\"avenues, as spacious as Whitman\"). This matches the setting of Vienna's wide boulevards, but Walt Whitman was an American, not an English, poet.\n\nThe question is a riddle that combines elements from both stories. However, the most definitive and non-negotiable part of the question is the request for the \"surname of an **English** poet.\" Therefore, the correct answer to the riddle as phrased is Keats.\n\n<<<Keats>>>"
