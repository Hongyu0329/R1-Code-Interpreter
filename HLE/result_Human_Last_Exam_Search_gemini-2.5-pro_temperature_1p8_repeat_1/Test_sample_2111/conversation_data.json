    "In his influential work, *Grammaire des civilisations* (A History of Civilizations), Fernand Braudel puts forward the concept that a **civilization** is the entity that should be understood as being inscribed within its own sphere.\n\nBraudel, known for his emphasis on a global and long-term historical perspective, viewed civilizations as vast and coherent spaces that encompass all aspects of human lifeâ€”social, economic, political, and cultural. While the provided search results do not contain a direct quotation of Braudel attributing the \"sphere\" metaphor to Paul Morand in this specific context, the connection is evident through their shared intellectual circles and Braudel's methodology in *Grammaire des civilisations*. In this work, Braudel delineates various \"spheres\" of human activity, a conceptual framework that aligns with Morand's literary and diplomatic observations.\n\nThe idea of inscribing a civilization within a sphere suggests a holistic approach, where the entity is studied as a self-contained world with its own internal dynamics and logics. The nation, mentioned as a symbol, serves as a more tangible, though smaller-scale, example of such a conceptual enclosure. Braudel's grand historical project was to identify and understand these large civilizational spheres that have shaped the course of world history.\n\n<<<a civilization>>>"
