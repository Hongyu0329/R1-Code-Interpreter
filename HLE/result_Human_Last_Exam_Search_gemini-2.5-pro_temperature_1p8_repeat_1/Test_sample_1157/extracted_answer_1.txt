This detailed management plan outlines the necessary steps for the patient's care. It begins with immediate wound and systemic health management, recognizing the futility of replanting the avulsed teeth after a 28-hour delay. The significance of the patient's uncontrolled diabetes and prognathic mandible are integrated into the treatment strategy. The cellular basis for the healing process is explained, highlighting the roles of inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts. For prosthetic replacement, a cast metal removable partial denture is recommended for its durability and stability. The abutment teeth—specifically the left second premolar and teeth on the right side for cross-arch stabilization—are chosen to provide a biomechanically sound and long-lasting solution, with special consideration for aesthetics on the anterior teeth.
