In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the partition function Z is given by the functional integral Z = ∫Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ]), where S_E is the Euclidean action. For a free scalar field, the action is S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫ dτ d^(D-1)x [ (∂_μϕ)^2 + m^2ϕ^2 ]. By performing an integration by parts, this can be written as S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫ dτ d^(D-1)x ϕ(-∂_μ∂^μ + m^2)ϕ. The inner product in this function space is defined as (f, g) = ∫ dτ d^(D-1)x f(x,τ)g(x,τ). Therefore, the operator D_ϕ is the differential operator D_ϕ = -∂_μ∂^μ + m^2. The inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is then given by (ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ dτ d^(D-1)x ϕ(-∂_μ∂^μ + m^2)ϕ, which is equal to twice the Euclidean action for the free field, 2S_E[ϕ]. This quadratic form is central to evaluating the Gaussian functional integral.
