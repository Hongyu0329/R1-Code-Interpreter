    "### Inner Product in the Functional Integral for a Neutral Scalar Field at Finite Temperature\n\nIn the framework of finite-temperature field theory, the partition function (Z) for a neutral scalar field (ϕ) is expressed through a functional integral over all possible field configurations. This is formulated in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate is Wick-rotated to imaginary time (τ = it). The imaginary time is compactified on a circle of circumference β = 1/T, where T is the temperature.\n\nThe partition function is given by:\n\nZ = ∫Dϕ *e*<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ]</sup>\n\nwhere Dϕ is the functional measure, and S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. For a free, neutral scalar field with mass *m*, the Euclidean action in *D* spacetime dimensions (one of which is the compactified imaginary time) is:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ∫d<sup>D-1</sup>x [ ½ (∂<sub>τ</sub>ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + ½ (∇ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + ½ m<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sup>2</sup> ]\n\nThrough integration by parts, and assuming the fields are periodic in imaginary time with period β (a consequence of the trace in the partition function for bosonic fields), the action can be written in a quadratic form that highlights the operator acting on the field:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ½ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ∫d<sup>D-1</sup>x ϕ(x, τ) ( -∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup> ) ϕ(x, τ)\n\nThis brings us to the concept of an inner product in the space of field configurations. The standard inner product for two real-valued functions, such as fields f(x) and g(x), over a given domain is defined as the integral of their product over that domain. In this context of finite-temperature field theory, the domain is the Euclidean spacetime volume V<sub>E</sub> = [0, β] × V, where V is the spatial volume.\n\nThus, the inner product of two field configurations, ϕ<sub>1</sub> and ϕ<sub>2</sub>, is given by:\n\n(ϕ<sub>1</sub>, ϕ<sub>2</sub>) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ∫d<sup>D-1</sup>x ϕ<sub>1</sub>(x, τ) ϕ<sub>2</sub>(x, τ)\n\nWith this definition, the Euclidean action can be expressed concisely as an inner product. If we define the operator D<sub>ϕ</sub> as:\n\nD<sub>ϕ</sub> = -∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup> = -∂<sub>μ</sub>∂<sup>μ</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>\n\nwhere ∂<sub>μ</sub>∂<sup>μ</sup> is the Euclidean Laplacian, then the inner product (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) is:\n\n(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ∫d<sup>D-1</sup>x ϕ(x, τ) ( -∂<sub>μ</sub>∂<sup>μ</sup> + m<sup>2</sup> ) ϕ(x, τ)\n\nComparing this with the expression for the Euclidean action, we find a direct relationship. Specifically, the inner product (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) is precisely twice the free part of the Euclidean action:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ)\n\nTherefore, the inner product (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature represents twice the kinetic and mass terms of the Euclidean action. This quadratic form is fundamental for performing the Gaussian functional integral to determine the partition function and derive the thermodynamic properties of the system. The operator D<sub>ϕ</sub> encapsulates the dynamics of the free field, and its eigenvalues, which are related to the Matsubara frequencies (ω<sub>n</sub> = 2nπT) and spatial momenta, determine the propagator of the theory at finite temperature.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the partition function Z is given by the functional integral Z = ∫Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ]), where S_E is the Euclidean action. For a free scalar field, the action is S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫ dτ d^(D-1)x [ (∂_μϕ)^2 + m^2ϕ^2 ]. By performing an integration by parts, this can be written as S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫ dτ d^(D-1)x ϕ(-∂_μ∂^μ + m^2)ϕ. The inner product in this function space is defined as (f, g) = ∫ dτ d^(D-1)x f(x,τ)g(x,τ). Therefore, the operator D_ϕ is the differential operator D_ϕ = -∂_μ∂^μ + m^2. The inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is then given by (ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ dτ d^(D-1)x ϕ(-∂_μ∂^μ + m^2)ϕ, which is equal to twice the Euclidean action for the free field, 2S_E[ϕ]. This quadratic form is central to evaluating the Gaussian functional integral.>>>"
