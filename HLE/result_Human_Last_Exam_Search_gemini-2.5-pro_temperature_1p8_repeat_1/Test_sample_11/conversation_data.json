    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law. This law, enacted in 1973, is widely recognized in legal scholarship as the legislative origin of the good faith principle in Israeli contract law.\n\nIn particular, sections 12 and 39 of the Contracts (General Part) Law are highlighted as the key provisions. Section 12 mandates that parties to a negotiation for a contract must act in a customary manner and in good faith. Section 39 extends this duty of good faith to the fulfillment of contractual obligations and the exercise of rights arising from a contract. The introduction of this duty has been described as a radical change in Israeli contract law and a significant deviation from English law.\n\nThe principle has since been expanded through case law to apply to all areas of private law and has become a cornerstone of the Israeli legal system.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
