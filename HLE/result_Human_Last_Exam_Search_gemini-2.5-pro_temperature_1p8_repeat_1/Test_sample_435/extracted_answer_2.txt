Based on the available evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to have a higher cytokine release profile, including an increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, and a higher likelihood of inducing clinical cytokine release syndrome compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
