    "I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nAlthough historical records confirm that the town of Bártfa had a system of self-governance which included a town judge (*iudex*) during the 15th century, the specific name of the individual holding this office in the year 1461 is not available in the consulted sources.\n\nKey historical publications, such as \"Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára 1319–1526\" by Béla Iványi, which would likely contain this information, are not fully accessible through the performed searches. While the existence of town records and the functions of the town council and judge are mentioned in several scholarly articles, a list of judges for the specific year has not been found. One source mentions a \"Szaniszló Jánosfia György\" as the judge of Bártfa in 1446, but there is no information available for the year 1461.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the answer.>>>"
