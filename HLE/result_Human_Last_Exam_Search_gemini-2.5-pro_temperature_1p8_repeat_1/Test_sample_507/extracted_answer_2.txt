It is not possible to definitively identify two languages from two Asian cultures with no direct contact where the words for "broom", "mom", and "dad" are all nearly identical or highly similar based on available data. However, for the words "mom" and "dad", Turkish and Malay show a remarkable similarity. In Turkish, "dad" is "Baba", and in Malay, "Baba" is also a term used for "dad". The word "Mama" is also used for "mom" in Malay, which is phonetically similar to "Ana", a word for mother in Turkish. The words for "broom", however, are "süpürge" (Turkish) and "penyapu/sapu" (Malay), which are not similar.
