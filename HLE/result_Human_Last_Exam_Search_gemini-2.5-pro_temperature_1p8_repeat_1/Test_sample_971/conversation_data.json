    "Despite extensive efforts to locate a video of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote*, a definitive video of the Act I variation is unavailable. While several online sources reference a guest performance in Novosibirsk, Siberia in 2008, and another in Brazil that same year, the video links provided are no longer active.\n\nReviews from around that time praise Osipova's exceptional turning ability, with descriptions of her performances including \"dizzying series of revolutions\" and noting she is a \"natural turner\". However, without access to the specific 2008 performance video, it is impossible to provide an accurate count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that she performed in the Act I variation.\n\nA comparison video that includes Osipova performing the Kitri variation exists, but it is not from the specified 2008 Bolshoi Ballet production. Therefore, a precise answer to the user's question cannot be given.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number as a video of the 2008 performance is not available for verification.>>>"
