    "**The Book of Numbers is the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespearean play, appearing in *The Second Part of King Henry VI*.**\n\nIn Act 2, Scene 1 of *The Second Part of King Henry VI*, the character of Richard, Duke of York, makes a direct reference to the biblical text. When debating the legitimacy of King Henry VI's marriage and its implications for the line of succession, he states: \"For in the book of Numbers is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\nWhile Shakespeare makes numerous allusions to the stories and themes of earlier biblical books, particularly Genesis, this is the first instance in his plays where a book of the Bible is explicitly named. *The Second Part of King Henry VI* is believed to have been written in the early 1590s, predating other plays that also contain direct mentions of biblical books. For example, the same book, \"Numbers,\" is also mentioned in *Henry V*, but this play was written later, around 1599.\n\nThe canonical order of the Bible places the Book of Numbers as the fourth book of the Old Testament, following Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. Extensive searches have not revealed any direct naming of these preceding books in Shakespeare's works, making the reference in *The Second Part of King Henry VI* the earliest mention by name of a book from the Bible in the order it appears in the holy text.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, in *The Second Part of King Henry VI*>>>"
