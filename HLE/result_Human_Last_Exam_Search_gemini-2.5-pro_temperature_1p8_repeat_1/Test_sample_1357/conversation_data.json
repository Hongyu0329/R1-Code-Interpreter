    "Under the assumption that the Jacobian of a genus 4 curve defined over a valuation field has good reduction, there is only **one** type of stable reduction for the curve itself.\n\nA foundational result in the theory of algebraic curves, established by Deligne and Mumford, states that if the Jacobian of a curve has stable reduction, then the curve itself must also have stable reduction. Good reduction is a specific and stronger type of stable reduction.\n\nWhen the Jacobian of a curve C has good reduction, its reduction is an abelian variety of the same dimension. This condition stringently dictates the structure of the stable reduction of the curve C. The special fiber of the stable model of the curve must be a smooth curve of the same genus.\n\nFor a genus 4 curve, if its Jacobian has good reduction, any semi-stable model of the curve will have a special fiber whose main component is a smooth curve of genus 4. Any other components must be rational curves (genus 0) that can be \"contracted\" in the process of forming the unique stable model, leaving a single, smooth curve of genus 4. Therefore, the curve itself is said to have good reduction.\n\nConsequently, there is no variation in the combinatorial structure of the stable reduction under this hypothesis. The only possible configuration is an irreducible, smooth curve of genus 4.\n\n<<<1>>>"
