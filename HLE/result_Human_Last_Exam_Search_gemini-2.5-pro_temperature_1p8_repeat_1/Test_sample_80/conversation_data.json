    "On a standard 8x8 chessboard, there are a total of 28 edge squares. The game described aims to place the maximum number of bishops on these squares without any of them attacking each other.\n\nA bishop attacks any other piece along the same diagonal. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on a chessboard is 14. To achieve this, all 14 bishops must be positioned on the edge squares of the board. For instance, one possible arrangement is to place bishops on all 8 squares of the top row and the 6 central squares of the bottom row.\n\nWith 28 total edge squares and a maximum of 14 bishops occupying them, the number of edge squares left empty would be:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (maximum non-attacking bishops) = 14\n\nTherefore, if two people succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
