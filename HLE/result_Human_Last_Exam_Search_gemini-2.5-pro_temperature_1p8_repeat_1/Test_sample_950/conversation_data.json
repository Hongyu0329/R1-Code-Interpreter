    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 3.\n\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr(3, 5)$. This space is a compact, non-orientable manifold of dimension $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$. A fundamental property of the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is that any torsion element has order 2. This means the torsion subgroup is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The \"rank\" in this context refers to the number of these $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands, which is the dimension of the torsion subgroup considered as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe Grassmannian $Gr(3, 5)$ is diffeomorphic to $Gr(2, 5)$ by the map that sends a 3-dimensional subspace to its 2-dimensional orthogonal complement. This allows us to use results for $Gr(k, n)$ with $k=2$ and $n=5$.\n\nA key theorem by Gitler and Stasheff provides the total number of generators for the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology of $Gr(k, n)$ when $n$ is odd and $k$ is even. The theorem states that this number is equal to $k(n-k)/2$.\n\nFor the space $Gr(2, 5)$, we have $k=2$ and $n=5$. Since $n$ is odd and $k$ is even, the theorem applies. The number of generators for the torsion subgroup is:\n$$ \\frac{k(n-k)}{2} = \\frac{2(5-2)}{2} = 3 $$\nThis indicates that the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$. The rank of this torsion subgroup, interpreted as its dimension over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, is 3. This is further corroborated by specific computations of the integral cohomology groups of $Gr(2, 5)$.\n\nTo be more explicit, the integral cohomology groups of $Gr(3,5) \\cong Gr(2,5)$ that contain torsion are:\n*   $H^4(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^6(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each degree. Therefore, the total torsion subgroup is $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$. The rank of this group is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
