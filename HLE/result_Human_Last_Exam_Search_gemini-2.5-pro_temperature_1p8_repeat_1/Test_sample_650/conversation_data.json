    "The computational time complexity of the algorithm IMAG(n, c) is determined by the number of iterations in the `while` loop and the complexity of the operations inside the loop.\n\n1.  **Loop Analysis**: The `while` loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   Initially, `x = n`. The value of `q` is set to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is replaced by the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   This is equivalent to repeatedly dividing `n` by `c`. The loop will execute as many times as you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0.\n    *   The number of such divisions is given by the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`, which is `log_c(n)`. For instance, if `n = c^k`, you would divide `k` times.\n    *   Therefore, the loop runs `O(log_c(n))` times.\n\n2.  **Operation Analysis**: Inside the `while` loop, the following operations are performed in each iteration:\n    *   `i := i + 1`: One increment operation.\n    *   `x := q`: One assignment.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One integer division.\n    *   `a_i := x — qc`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n\n    Assuming that these basic arithmetic operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction) take constant time, O(1), the work done inside the loop is constant for each iteration.\n\n3.  **Total Complexity**: The total time complexity is the product of the number of iterations and the complexity of the work done in each iteration.\n    *   Total Complexity = (Number of iterations) × (Complexity per iteration)\n    *   Total Complexity = `O(log_c(n)) × O(1)`\n    *   Total Complexity = `O(log_c(n))`\n\nThe initial step (Step 1) also involves a constant number of O(1) operations and does not affect the overall asymptotic complexity. The final return step (Step 3) takes time proportional to the number of digits, which is also `O(log_c(n))`.\n\nThus, the dominant factor is the `while` loop, and the computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
