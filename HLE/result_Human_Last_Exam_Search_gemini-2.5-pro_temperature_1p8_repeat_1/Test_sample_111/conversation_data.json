Her death occurred at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\nIn 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was sent abroad on a diplomatic mission for the king. It is believed that he traveled to Milan, Italy, to attend the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp, son of King Edward III, to Violante Visconti. Prince Lionel died in Italy in October 1368, shortly after the wedding. Given that Chaucer was likely part of Prince Lionel's retinue and that Lionel died in Italy in October 1368, it places Chaucer in Italy at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death in September of the same year.\n\nChaucer later wrote his first major work, *The Book of the Duchess*, as an elegy in her honor.\n\n<<<A>>>"
