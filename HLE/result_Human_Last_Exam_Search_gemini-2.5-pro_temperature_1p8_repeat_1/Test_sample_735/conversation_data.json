    "There are exactly 28 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset S of a group G is called product-free if for all elements a and b in S, their product ab is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G. The classification of finite groups that contain a maximal product-free set of size 3 was completed by the work of Michael Giudici, Sarah Hart, and Chimere Anabanti. They established that any such group G must have an order |G| of at most 24.\n\nThe exhaustive list of these non-isomorphic groups is compiled from the tables and results presented in their research. The groups are:\n\n**Abelian Groups (13 groups):**\n*   Cyclic groups: C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂, C₁₄, C₁₅, C₁₈\n*   Direct products of cyclic groups: C₂ × C₄, C₂ × C₆, C₃ × C₃\n\n**Non-Abelian Groups (15 groups):**\n*   Dihedral groups: D₆ (isomorphic to S₃), D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₁₈\n*   Quaternion and Dicyclic groups: Q₈ (quaternion group), Q₁₂ (dicyclic group of order 12)\n*   Alternating and Symmetric groups: A₄ (alternating group on 4 letters)\n*   Special Linear group: SL(2,3) (special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements, order 24)\n*   Other non-abelian groups:\n    *   The two non-abelian groups of order 20: the dicyclic group Dic₅ (also denoted Q₂₀) and the semidirect product C₅ ⋊ C₄.\n    *   The non-abelian group of order 21, which is the semidirect product C₇ ⋊ C₃.\n    *   One of the non-abelian groups of order 18, specifically `(C₃ × C₃) ⋊ C₂`.\n    *    The group C₂ × A₄ of order 24.\n\nCounting these unique non-isomorphic groups gives a total of 28.\n\n<<<28>>>"
