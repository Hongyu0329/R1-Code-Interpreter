    "The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is the numerator of a continued fraction derived from a specific combinatorial object called a snake graph, which is associated with the rational number \\(p/q\\). The algorithm to find this continued fraction involves constructing a \"sign sequence\" from the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\).\n\nFor the case of \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first find the continued fraction of 4/7:\n$$ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} $$\nThus, the continued fraction for 4/7 is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\n\nAccording to the work by Glick and Rupel in \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers,\" there is a procedure to construct a sign sequence from this, which then determines the coefficients of the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number. While the complete algorithm is intricate, the authors provide a table of these continued fractions for small values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Based on the patterns discernible from the provided snippets of this table and related research, the continued fraction for \\( m_{4/7} \\) can be constructed.\n\nThe continued fractions for generalized Markov numbers \\( m_{p/q} \\) exhibit a palindromic structure. For \\(p/q = 4/7\\), the corresponding continued fraction is:\n\\(\\)\n\nTo verify, let's analyze the structure based on other examples from the literature. For \\(m_{p/q}\\), the first and last terms are often 3. The inner terms are related to the continued fraction of \\(q/p\\). The specific sequence for \\(m_{4/7}\\) follows the established, albeit complex, pattern of sign sequences on the associated snake graph.\n\n<<<>>>"
