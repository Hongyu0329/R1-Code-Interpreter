    "John Miltonâ€™s epic poem *Paradise Lost* mentions three historical figures by name who are explicitly referred to as saints. Additionally, the poem includes satirical references to unnamed saints and uses the term \"saints\" in a more general sense to refer to the righteous.\n\nThe historical figures named as saints are:\n*   **Saint Peter:** In Book III, Milton describes the \"Paradise of Fools,\" also known as the Limbo of Vanity. He satirically depicts Catholic clergy and pilgrims who believe they will be met by \"Saint Peter at Heav'n's wicket... with his keys\".\n*   **Enoch and Elijah:** These two Old Testament figures are referred to as \"translated Saints\". In Book III, Milton writes that the moon could be the home of \"translated Saints, or middle Spirits... betwixt the Angelical and Human kind\". These are identified as Enoch and Elijah, who, according to biblical tradition, were taken to heaven without experiencing death.\n\nIn addition to these named individuals, Milton makes broader, often critical, references to saints:\n*   He populates the \"Paradise of Fools\" with \"Eremites and Friars, / White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery\". This is a critique of monastic orders and those who believe that wearing the habit of a Dominican or Franciscan friar at death will guarantee their passage to heaven.\n*   The term \"saints\" is also used more generally to describe the righteous who will be resurrected on Judgment Day.\n\nIn the vision of the future shown to Adam by the Archangel Michael in Books XI and XII, numerous biblical figures appear, such as Cain, Abel, and Noah, and there is a prophecy of the coming of the Messiah, prefigured by \"Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call\". However, these figures in the vision are not explicitly referred to as \"saints\" by name within the text of the vision.\n\nTherefore, the precise number of historical saints mentioned by name is three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
