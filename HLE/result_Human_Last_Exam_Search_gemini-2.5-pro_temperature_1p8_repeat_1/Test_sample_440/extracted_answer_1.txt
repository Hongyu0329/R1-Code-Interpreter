The density profile \(\rho(z)\) is given by the expression \(\rho(z) = m_A c_A(z) + m_B c_B(z)\), where the number density functions \(c_A(z)\) and \(c_B(z)\) are the solutions to the system of coupled integral-algebraic equations described above. These equations incorporate the effects of the gravitational potential and the non-ideal van der Waals interactions between the gas particles. A numerical solver is required to find the explicit functions for \(c_A(z)\) and \(c_B(z)\).
