    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X×Y×Z → X, G: Y×X×Z → Y, and H: Z×X×Y → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z such that:\nF(x, y, z) = x\nG(y, x, z) = y\nH(z, x, y) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, typically in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. The core requirements involve the properties of the underlying spaces, a mixed monotone property of the functions, and a contractive condition.\n\n### General Conditions:\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are established by theorems in the field of nonlinear analysis and fixed-point theory. These conditions are:\n\n1.  **Underlying Space**: The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be **partially ordered complete metric spaces**. A partial order (≤) is defined on each set, and the metric (d) must be complete, meaning every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a point within the space.\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a **mixed monotone property**. This property describes how the functions behave with respect to the partial ordering. For instance, a function F: X×Y×Z → X has the mixed monotone property if it is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second. Similar properties are required for G and H relative to their respective domains.\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions must collectively satisfy a **contractive condition**. This is a crucial requirement that ensures the iterative application of the functions will converge to a unique fixed point. An example of such a condition for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w is:\n    d(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) + d(G(y,x,z), G(v,u,w)) + d(H(z,x,y), H(w,u,v)) ≤ k * (d(x,u) + d(y,v) + d(z,w))\n    where 0 ≤ k < 1 is a constant. More general contractive conditions involving altering distance functions or control functions also exist.\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist an initial triple (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X×Y×Z that satisfies a specific ordering relationship with the functions. For example, there exist x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, z₀ ∈ Z such that:\n    x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀)\n    z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀)\n    This condition provides a starting point for an iterative sequence that is guaranteed to converge.\n\n5.  **Continuity or Regularity**: In some versions of the theorem, the functions F, G, and H are required to be continuous. However, this condition can be relaxed if the space has a property known as **regularity**. A partially ordered metric space is regular if every non-decreasing sequence that converges to a point is bounded above by that point.\n\n### A More Formal Theorem:\n\nA typical theorem for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point can be summarized as follows:\n\nLet (X, ≤, d_X), (Y, ≤, d_Y), and (Z, ≤, d_Z) be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Let F: X×Y×Z → X, G: Y×X×Z → Y, and H: Z×X×Y → Z be continuous functions satisfying the mixed monotone property. Assume there exist constants k₁, k₂, k₃ ≥ 0 with k₁ + k₂ + k₃ < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ≥ u, y ≤ v, z ≥ w, the following contractive conditions hold:\nd(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) ≤ k₁ (d(x,u) + d(y,v) + d(z,w))\nd(G(y,x,z), G(v,u,w)) ≤ k₂ (d(x,u) + d(y,v) + d(z,w))\nd(H(z,x,y), H(w,u,v)) ≤ k₃ (d(x,u) + d(y,v) + d(z,w))\n\nIf there exists a point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X×Y×Z such that x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀), then there exists an FGH-tripled fixed point (x*, y*, z*). If the underlying spaces also satisfy a comparability condition (for any two points, there exists a third that is related to both by the partial order), then the fixed point is unique.\n\nVariations of these conditions exist, for instance, in the context of G-metric spaces, fuzzy metric spaces, or by using different types of contractive conditions. Additionally, the concept can be extended to coincidence points, where F(x, y, z) = gx for some function g, instead of just a fixed point.\n\n<<<A set of conditions for the functions F: X×Y×Z→X, G: Y×X×Z→Y, and H: Z×X×Y→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n2.  The functions F, G, and H possess the mixed monotone property with respect to the partial order on their domains.\n3.  The functions satisfy a contractive condition, typically bounding the sum of distances of the function outputs by a factor (less than 1) of the sum of the distances of the inputs.\n4.  There exists an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) such that x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀).\n5.  Either the functions are continuous, or the spaces satisfy a regularity condition.>>>"
