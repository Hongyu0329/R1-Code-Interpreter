A set of conditions for the functions F: X×Y×Z→X, G: Y×X×Z→Y, and H: Z×X×Y→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are:
1.  The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are partially ordered complete metric spaces.
2.  The functions F, G, and H possess the mixed monotone property with respect to the partial order on their domains.
3.  The functions satisfy a contractive condition, typically bounding the sum of distances of the function outputs by a factor (less than 1) of the sum of the distances of the inputs.
4.  There exists an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) such that x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀).
5.  Either the functions are continuous, or the spaces satisfy a regularity condition.
