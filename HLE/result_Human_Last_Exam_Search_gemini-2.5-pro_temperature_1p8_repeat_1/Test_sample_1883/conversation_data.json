    "Under thermal conditions, the cyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is an electrocyclic reaction. The stereochemical outcome of this reaction can be predicted using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory and the associated Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n### Analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory\n\n1.  **Identify the π-electron system:** The reacting species, deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, is a conjugated polyene with four π-bonds. This constitutes an 8π-electron system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 in this case) undergoes a conrotatory ring closure under thermal conditions.\n\n2.  **Examine the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO):** For an 8π system in its electronic ground state (thermal conditions), the HOMO is ψ₄. In this molecular orbital, the p-orbitals at the terminal carbons of the conjugated system have lobes of opposite phase on the same side of the molecule. To achieve constructive overlap and form the new σ-bond, the termini must rotate in the same direction—either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise. This type of motion is defined as **conrotatory**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Reactant:** The starting material is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The stereochemistry is defined by the arrangement of the substituents on the double bonds. For an electrocyclic reaction, the crucial substituents are those on the terminal carbons of the π-system, which in this case are the methyl groups.\n\n    When the molecule adopts the s-cis conformation required for cyclization, the stereochemistry of the double bonds dictates the relative positions of the methyl groups.\n    *   The *(2Z)* configuration places the methyl group on the \"outside\" of the curve of the carbon chain.\n    *   The *(8E)* configuration also places its methyl group on the \"outside\".\n\n4.  **Predict the Product Stereochemistry:** During a conrotatory ring closure, substituents that are both on the \"outside\" of the reactant's carbon framework will both end up on the same side of the newly formed ring. Therefore, they will be *cis* to each other in the product. The product formed is *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene, which corresponds to isomer A.\n\n### Conclusion on the Ratio of Products A and B\n\nPericyclic reactions are known for their high degree of stereospecificity. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules, derived from FMO theory, predict that for the given reactant under thermal conditions, only the conrotatory pathway is \"symmetry-allowed\". The alternative \"symmetry-forbidden\" disrotatory pathway has a much higher activation energy and does not occur to any significant extent.\n\nThe conrotatory closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene specifically leads to the formation of the *cis*-isomer (A). The formation of the *trans*-isomer (B) would require a disrotatory ring closure, which is thermally forbidden. Consequently, only isomer A is produced.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of isomer A (*cis*) to isomer B (*trans*) is 100:0.\n\n<<<100:0>>>"
