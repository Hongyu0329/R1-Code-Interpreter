    "Had the Norse never invaded, the Modern English word for a female sibling would likely be \"**suster**.\"\n\nHere is the linguistic path that would have led to this form:\n\n*   **Old English:** The original Anglo-Saxon word for sister was *sweostor* or *swuster*. This word is of Proto-Germanic origin, sharing roots with the words for \"sister\" in many other Germanic languages.\n\n*   **Norse Influence:** During the Viking Age, Old Norse-speaking settlers brought their word for sister, *systir*, to England. This Norse form, with its \"i\" sound, directly influenced the development of the English language, eventually giving us the modern word \"sister\". The interaction between the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse led to the adoption of many Old Norse words, including fundamental vocabulary like *they, their, them*, *sky*, and *knife*.\n\n*   **Hypothetical Evolution:** Without the influence of Old Norse *systir*, the Old English *sweostor* would have followed a different evolutionary path. During the transition to Middle English, several forms existed, including *suster*. This form shows a common linguistic simplification where the \"w\" sound after an \"s\" is dropped (as also seen in \"so\" from Old English *swƒÅ*), and the vowel shifts.\n\nFollowing the regular sound changes from Middle to Modern English, the Middle English *suster* (pronounced with a short \"u\" sound) would have evolved into the modern \"suster\" (pronounced to rhyme with \"cluster\")."
