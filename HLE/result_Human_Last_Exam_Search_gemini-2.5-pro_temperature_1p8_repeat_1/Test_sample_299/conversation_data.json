    "The question asks for the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of such a function $f$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity**: If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Therefore, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Range of $f \\circ f$**: The range of the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. This means the range of $f(f(x))$ is also $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nLet's examine the two cases for monotonicity:\n\n**Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\nIf $f$ is a strictly decreasing function, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is a strictly increasing function. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, which is strictly increasing.\nSince $f$ is a decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its limit as $x \\to \\infty$ must exist and be some value $L$. By continuity, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y)$. For this to be well-defined, $L$ must be a real number. So, $f(L) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\exp(x) = \\infty$, which is impossible for a real-valued function $f$.\nAnother line of reasoning that leads to a contradiction is to consider fixed points. For $x<0$, the range of $f$ must be positive (since the domain of the outer $f$ is the range of the inner $f$, and $f(f(x))$ is always positive), so $f(x) > 0 > x$. For large positive $x$, since $f$ is decreasing, its value must tend towards a constant or $-\\infty$. The limit must be 0 for $f(f(x))$ to work out. So for large $x$, $f(x) < x$. The continuous function $g(x) = f(x) - x$ is positive for $x<0$ and negative for large $x$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some $x_0$ for which $g(x_0)=0$, meaning $f(x_0)=x_0$. If such a fixed point exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$, an equation which has no real solutions. This contradiction rules out the possibility of $f$ being strictly decreasing.\n\n**Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\nIf $f$ is strictly increasing, so is $f \\circ f$. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\nA fixed point for $f$ would imply a fixed point for $\\exp(x)$, which does not exist. Therefore, $f(x)$ is never equal to $x$. Since $f(x)-x$ is a continuous function that is never zero, it must be either always positive or always negative. If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then because $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would imply $\\exp(x) < x$, which is false for all real $x$. Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nAs $x \\to -\\infty$, $\\exp(x) \\to 0$. So, $f(f(x)) \\to 0$. Since $f$ is increasing, it must approach some limit $y_0$ as $x \\to -\\infty$. Because the range of $f$ is a subset of the domain of $f$, this limit $y_0$ must be a real number. By continuity of $f$ at $y_0$, we have $f(y_0) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = 0$. Since for all $x$, $f(x)>y_0$, we must have $f(y_0) > y_0$, which means $0 > y_0$.\n\nThe existence of such functions has been studied and affirmed. The construction of such a function hinges on defining it on a specific interval, which then determines the function over its entire domain.\n\nThe construction proceeds as follows:\n1.  Choose a value for $y_0 \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. This $y_0$ will be the infimum of the range of $f$.\n2.  Choose a continuous, strictly increasing function $f_0$ on the interval $[y_0, 0]$ such that $f_0(y_0) = 0$ and $f_0(0) = \\exp(y_0)$. For the condition $f(x) > x$ to hold, we also need $f_0(x) > x$ for all $x \\in [y_0, 0]$. Since $y_0 < 0$ and $\\exp(y_0) > 0$, the endpoints of the graph of $f_0$ at $x=y_0$ and $x=0$ are above the line $y=x$. This ensures that such a choice for $f_0$ is possible.\n3.  Once $y_0$ and the function $f_0$ on $[y_0, 0]$ are chosen, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ by the relation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   For $x > 0$, the values of $f(x)$ are determined recursively. For example, for $x \\in (0, \\exp(y_0)]$, we have $x=f_0(t)$ for some unique $t \\in [y_0,0)$, so $f(x) = f(f_0(t)) = \\exp(t) = \\exp(f_0^{-1}(x))$.\n    *   For $x < y_0$, let $y = f(x)$. Since $f$ is increasing, $y$ must be in $(y_0, 0)$. Then $f(y) = f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. Since $y \\in (y_0, 0)$, $f(y)=f_0(y)$. So $f_0(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, which means $f(x) = f_0^{-1}(\\exp(x))$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of such functions depends on the number of choices we have in this construction.\n\n*   **Choice of $y_0$**: The value of $y_0$ can be any real number in $(-\\infty, 0)$. The set of possible values for $y_0$ is the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Each distinct value of $y_0$ leads to a distinct function $f$, as the functions will have different ranges ($(y_0, \\infty)$).\n\n*   **Choice of $f_0$**: For a fixed $y_0$, we need to choose a continuous strictly increasing function $f_0$ from $[y_0, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(y_0)]$ that satisfies $f_0(x)>x$. The set of such functions has the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$. To see this, one can note that for any value $c \\in (y_0, 0)$, the value $f_0(c)$ can be chosen from a non-trivial interval of real numbers, and each choice leads to a different function. Different choices of $f_0$ for the same $y_0$ also result in distinct overall functions $f$.\n\nSince we have a continuum of choices for $y_0$, and for each such choice, we have a continuum of choices for the function $f_0$, the total number of distinct continuous functions $f$ satisfying the given equation is the product of these cardinalities.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of real numbers, also known as the continuum, is denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$. The cardinality of the set in question is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<The cardinality is $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).>>>The question asks for the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of such a function $f$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity**: If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$.
