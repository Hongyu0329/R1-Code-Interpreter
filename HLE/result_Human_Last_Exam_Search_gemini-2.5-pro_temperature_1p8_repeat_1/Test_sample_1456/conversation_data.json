    "The user wants to know the largest possible number of a specific topological feature (composants) in the product of two specific types of topological spaces (nondegenerate continua).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the definitions gathered from the initial search:\n*   **Continuum**: A nonempty, compact, connected metric space. It can also be defined as a compact, connected Hausdorff space, but the query specifies a metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate continuum**: A continuum containing more than one point.\n*   **Composant**: In an indecomposable continuum, a composant is a maximal set where any two points lie within a proper subcontinuum. For a point *p* in a continuum *H*, its composant contains all points *x* such that *x* and *p* are in some proper subcontinuum of *H*. The composants of an indecomposable continuum partition the space.\n*   **Product of two continua**: This will also be a continuum.\n\nFrom these definitions, the number of composants is a property of indecomposable continua. A continuum is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n\nThe number of composants of a nondegenerate *metric* indecomposable continuum is c, the cardinality of the real line. There exist non-metric indecomposable continua with one or two composants. Since the problem specifies a metric space, we are concerned with metric continua.\n\nThe question asks for the number of composants of the *product* of two nondegenerate continua, let's call them X and Y. For the product space X x Y to have a very large number of composants, it must be indecomposable. I need to find information about when the product of two continua is indecomposable and what the number of its composants would be in such a case.\n\nMy next step will be to search for information about the properties of the product of continua, specifically regarding indecomposability and the number of composants. I will also investigate how the number of composants of X and Y relate to the number of composants of X x Y.The search results provide crucial information. Firstly, a nondegenerate metric indecomposable continuum has *c* (the cardinality of the continuum, 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>) composants. The user's question is about the *product* of two nondegenerate continua. Let's call them X and Y.\n\nIf X and Y are both indecomposable continua, their product X × Y is also indecomposable. The question is, what is the number of composants of X × Y in this case? The problem states we are dealing with metric spaces, so we should consider X and Y to be metric continua.\n\nTo get the *largest possible* number of composants, we should construct X and Y to be indecomposable metric continua. In this scenario, both X and Y will each have *c* composants. Since X × Y is indecomposable, it will also have *c* composants.\n\nLet's consider if we can get a larger number of composants. M. Smith showed that for any infinite cardinal number *m*, there exists an indecomposable continuum with 2<sup>*m*</sup> composants. However, these are generally non-metric. The problem specifies a \"compact connected *metric* space\". For a metric space, the cardinality of the space itself cannot exceed *c*. The number of composants, being a collection of disjoint subsets, cannot exceed the cardinality of the space.\n\nTherefore, for any metric continuum, the number of composants is at most *c*. Since a metric indecomposable continuum has exactly *c* composants, this is the maximum possible for a single continuum.\n\nNow, let's analyze the product X × Y of two nondegenerate indecomposable metric continua. As established, X × Y is an indecomposable metric continuum. Therefore, the number of its composants must also be *c*.\n\nLet's think if we can construct X or Y as decomposable to get more composants in the product. If X is decomposable, it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua, say X = A ∪ B. A decomposable continuum has either one or three composants. Let's say X is an arc, which is decomposable and has 1 composant. Let Y be an indecomposable continuum with *c* composants. The product X × Y, where X is an arc, is decomposable.  Therefore, it will not have a large number of composants. For X × Y to be indecomposable, both X and Y must be indecomposable.\n\nSo the path to the maximum number of composants in the product is to have both X and Y be indecomposable. In this case, X, Y, and X × Y are all indecomposable metric continua, and they each have *c* composants. It doesn't seem possible to get more than *c* composants.\n\nA continuous surjective map f: X -> Y induces a 1-1 function from the set of composants of Y into the set of composants of X. The projection map from X × Y to X is a continuous surjection. This means that the number of composants of X × Y is at least the number of composants of X. Similarly, it's at least the number of composants of Y. Since X and Y can each have *c* composants, the product must have at least *c* composants. Since the product is a metric continuum, it can't have more than *c* composants.\n\nSo, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is *c*, the cardinality of the continuum. This occurs when both continua are indecomposable metric continua.To determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua, we need to understand the definitions of the terms involved and how they relate to each other.\n\nA **continuum** is defined as a compact, connected metric space. A continuum is **nondegenerate** if it consists of more than one point.\n\nA key concept is that of an **indecomposable continuum**, which is a continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. For a continuum to have more than a few composants, it generally needs to be indecomposable.\n\nA **composant** of an indecomposable continuum is a maximal set within which any two points lie in some proper subcontinuum. The set of composants of an indecomposable continuum forms a partition of that continuum.\n\nThe number of composants of a decomposable continuum is small, either one or three. However, for a nondegenerate *metric* indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is always **c**, the cardinality of the real line (the continuum).\n\nNow, let's consider the product of two nondegenerate continua, X and Y. For the product space X × Y to be indecomposable, both X and Y must be indecomposable continua. If either X or Y is decomposable, their product is also decomposable, which would limit the number of composants.\n\nTherefore, to achieve the largest possible number of composants in the product, we should choose both X and Y to be nondegenerate indecomposable metric continua. In this case:\n*   The continuum X has **c** composants.\n*   The continuum Y has **c** composants.\n*   The product space X × Y is an indecomposable metric continuum.\n\nSince X × Y is a nondegenerate indecomposable metric continuum, the number of its composants must also be **c**. The projection map from the product space X × Y onto X (or Y) is a continuous surjection. This implies that the number of composants in X × Y is at least as large as the number of composants in X (and Y). Therefore, the number of composants in the product is at least **c**. As a metric space, the total number of points in X × Y is **c**, so the number of disjoint composants cannot exceed **c**.\n\nThus, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
