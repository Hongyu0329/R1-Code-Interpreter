    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads with detection in the AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 channels, you should prepare a minimum of **13 essential controls**. These controls are critical for accurate instrument setup, proper compensation of spectral overlap, correct gate placement, and validation of your results.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls and their purpose:\n\n### I. Controls for Instrument Setup and Compensation (7 Tubes)\n\nThese controls are fundamental for any multicolor flow cytometry experiment to ensure the instrument is set up correctly and to mathematically correct for the spillover of fluorescent signals between detectors.\n\n1.  **Unstained Cells (1 tube):** This sample contains only cells in buffer. It is the most basic control and is used to:\n    *   Set the baseline voltage for the detectors (PMTs).\n    *   Determine the level of natural background fluorescence (autofluorescence) of your cells.\n\n2.  **Compensation Controls (5 tubes):** Because the emission spectra of different fluorophores can overlap, compensation is a mathematical correction that is required for accurate data analysis. You need a separate, single-stained control for each fluorophore in your panel. This can be done using either cells or antibody-capture beads.\n    *   **AF350 single stain:** Cells/beads + AF350-conjugated antibody.\n    *   **GFP single stain:** Cells expressing only GFP. If GFP is a reagent, then cells/beads + GFP reagent.\n    *   **PE single stain:** Cells/beads + PE-conjugated antibody (or PE-Streptavidin if used here).\n    *   **AF647 single stain:** Cells/beads + AF647-conjugated antibody.\n    *   **AF750 single stain:** Cells/beads + AF750-conjugated antibody.\n\n3.  **Viability Dye Control (1 tube):** Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. It is essential to include a viability dye to exclude dead cells from the analysis and sort. This control is a single stain of the viability dye (e.g., DAPI in the AF350 channel) and is part of your compensation controls, so it is already accounted for in the 5 tubes above if it occupies one of the listed channels. If a sixth, separate dye is used for viability, this would bring the total number of compensation tubes to six.\n\n### II. Controls for Gating and Specificity (6 Tubes)\n\nThese controls are necessary to accurately identify your target population and ensure the observed staining is specific.\n\n4.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** An FMO control contains all the antibodies in your panel *except for one*. This is the most critical control for setting accurate gates in a multicolor experiment, as it reveals the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the one that is missing. Ideally, you should prepare an FMO control for each fluorophore in your panel.\n    *   **FMO for AF350:** Cells stained with all antibodies except the one in the AF350 channel.\n    *   **FMO for GFP:** Cells stained with all antibodies except the one in the GFP channel.\n    *   **FMO for PE:** Cells stained with all antibodies except the one in the PE channel.\n    *   **FMO for AF647:** Cells stained with all antibodies except the one in the AF647 channel.\n    *   **FMO for AF750:** Cells stained with all antibodies except the one in the AF750 channel.\n\n5.  **Streptavidin Specificity Control (1 tube):** Since you are using a streptavidin-based detection method (likely a biotinylated primary antibody followed by a fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin), you must control for non-specific binding of the streptavidin itself.\n    *   This tube contains cells stained **only with the fluorescent streptavidin conjugate** (e.g., Streptavidin-PE) without the corresponding biotinylated primary antibody.\n\n### Summary of Essential Control Tubes\n\n| Control Type | Purpose | Number of Tubes |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: |\n| Unstained | Set baseline and measure autofluorescence | 1 |\n| Compensation (Single Stains) | Correct for spectral spillover | 5 |\n| FMO Controls | Set accurate gates for positive populations | 5 |\n| Streptavidin Specificity | Check for non-specific streptavidin binding | 1 |\n| **Total** | | **12** |\n\n*Note: The prompt does not specify if the GFP is an endogenous reporter or a fluorescent antibody stain. The setup remains largely the same, but the compensation and FMO controls for the GFP channel will use GFP-expressing cells.*\n\n### Optional and Additional Recommended Controls\n\n*   **Isotype Controls:** These are antibodies with the same isotype (e.g., IgG1, IgG2a) and fluorophore as your primary antibody but target an antigen not found on your cells. While their use is debated, they can be helpful for troubleshooting non-specific binding caused by the antibody's Fc region. FMO controls are generally considered more accurate for setting gates.\n*   **Biological Controls:** These include positive controls (cells known to express your target antigen) and negative controls (cells known to lack expression) to validate the entire staining protocol. Often, the experimental sample itself contains internal positive and negative populations. If not, preparing a known positive and negative sample is recommended.\n*   **Post-Sort Purity Check:** While not a preparatory control tube, it is an essential control for any sorting experiment. A small aliquot of your sorted cells should be re-analyzed on the cytometer to confirm the purity of the sorted population.\n\nFactoring in one crucial biological control, such as an unstimulated or negative cell population stained with the full panel, is highly recommended for validating your experiment.\n\n*   **Biological Control (1 tube):** An unstimulated or known-negative sample stained with the full panel.\n\nAdding this brings the final recommended number to **13 control tubes** for a comprehensive and reliable experiment.\n\n<<<13>>>"
