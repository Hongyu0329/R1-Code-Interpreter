    "In the world of ballroom dancing, the technique of each dance is meticulously defined, and certain movements are constrained by the fundamental principles of that dance. When it comes to the reverse turn, one dance, in particular, has a technical element that makes overturning it a disregard for its core mechanics.\n\nAfter a thorough review of the reverse turn technique in the Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, European Tango, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the **Slow Foxtrot** emerges as the dance where it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without violating the technique.\n\nThe reasoning lies in the lady's heel turn, which is a characteristic feature of the Slow Foxtrot's reverse turn. For the figure to be executed correctly, the lady must complete her heel turn with precision, and crucially, without overturning. If the lady overturns her heel turn, it physically impedes the man's ability to execute his subsequent steps correctly, as he needs to move around her. This inter-dependency, where one partner's correct (and not overturned) action is a prerequisite for the other's, is central to the dance's technique.\n\nIn the other dances:\n*   **Viennese Waltz:** While it is extremely difficult to overturn a reverse turn, particularly around a corner, it's not technically impossible. In fact, to navigate a corner with a reverse turn, a slight overturning action is theoretically required, though it is so challenging that dancers often opt for a natural turn instead.\n*   **English Waltz, European Tango, and Quickstep:** In these dances, the amount of turn for a reverse turn is clearly defined in the syllabus. Overturning would be a technical error and poor execution, but it does not fundamentally prevent the completion of the figure in the way it does in the Slow Foxtrot by obstructing the partner's movement.\n\nTherefore, the technique of the Slow Foxtrot, with its intricate and interdependent heel turn, makes it the dance in which overturning a reverse turn constitutes a fundamental disregard for its established technique.\n\n<<<D>>>"
