    "The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^8$.\n\nThis result is based on a general formula for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The formula, attributed to Robert Steinberg, states that the number of such tori, denoted $|\\mathcal{T}(G, q)|$, is given by:\n\n$|\\mathcal{T}(G, q)| = |Z(G)^\\circ(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot q^{\\text{rank}(G/Z(G))}$\n\nHere, $Z(G)^\\circ$ is the identity component of the center of $G$, and $\\text{rank}(G/Z(G))$ is the rank of the adjoint quotient group.\n\nFor a group $G$ of type $E_8$:\n*   The group is simple, which implies its center $Z(G)$ is a finite group scheme. For $E_8$, the center is trivial.\n*   Since the center is trivial, its identity component $Z(G)^\\circ$ is also trivial.\n*   The group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the trivial group is just a single point, so $|Z(G)^\\circ(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = 1$.\n*   The quotient group $G/Z(G)$ is isomorphic to $G$ itself.\n*   The rank of a group of type $E_8$ is 8.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula yields:\n\n$|\\mathcal{T}(E_8, q)| = 1 \\cdot q^8 = q^8$.\n\nThis result is explicitly stated in the introduction of a 1968 memoir by R. Steinberg, a foundational work on the topic of endomorphisms of linear algebraic groups. The formula itself can be found in more recent literature on reductive groups and their representations. It's important to note that the number of maximal tori is not necessarily equal to the number of Cartan subgroups (the groups of rational points of these tori), a distinction that resolves potential paradoxes when applying summation formulas over conjugacy classes of the Weyl group.\n\n<<<q^8>>>"
