    "To determine the largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17, a systematic search is required. A nine-digit palindromic number in base 17 can be represented as (d₈d₇d₆d₅d₄d₅d₆d₇d₈)₁₇, where the digits dᵢ range from 0 to 16. The letters A through G are used to represent the decimal values 10 through 16, respectively. For the number to be a nine-digit number, the leading digit, d₈, cannot be zero.\n\nThe value of this number in base 10 is calculated as:\nN = d₈(17⁸ + 17⁰) + d₇(17⁷ + 17¹) + d₆(17⁶ + 17²) + d₅(17⁵ + 17³) + d₄(17⁴)\n\nA key property to consider is the parity of the number. For a number to be prime (and not the number 2), it must be odd. The terms (17⁸+1), (17⁷+17), (17⁶+17²), and (17⁵+17³) are all even. Therefore, the sum of the first four terms is even. The parity of N is determined by the term d₄ × 17⁴. Since 17⁴ is an odd number, the entire number N is odd only if the central digit, d₄, is odd. The odd digits in base 17 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, B (11), D (13), and F (15).\n\nTo find the largest prime, we start with the largest possible nine-digit palindrome in base 17 and work downwards. This involves prioritizing larger digits for the outermost positions (d₈, d₇, etc.). The search begins with the highest possible values for the digits from left to right, keeping in mind that d₄ must be odd.\n\nThe largest possible palindrome would have G (16) for d₈, d₇, d₆, and d₅. We then test the odd values for d₄ in descending order.\n\nA systematic check reveals the following:\n*   (GGGGGGGGG)₁₇: The central digit G (16) is even, so the number is even and not prime.\n*   (GGGG F GGGGG)₁₇: The base 10 value is 118,587,792,975, which is divisible by 5.\n*   (GGGG D GGGGG)₁₇: The base 10 value is 118,587,625,933, which is divisible by 7.\n*   (GGGG B GGGGG)₁₇: The base 10 value is 118,587,458,891. Primality tests confirm that this number is prime.\n\nSince all larger nine-digit palindromic numbers in base 17 are composite, (GGGG B GGGGG)₁₇ is the largest prime with this property.\n\nThe base 10 value of (GGGG B GGGGG)₁₇ is calculated as follows:\nN = 16 × (17⁸ + 1) + 16 × (17⁷ + 17) + 16 × (17⁶ + 17²) + 16 × (17⁵ + 17³) + 11 × 17⁴\nN = 16 × (6,975,757,441 + 1) + 16 × (410,338,673 + 17) + 16 × (24,137,569 + 289) + 16 × (1,419,857 + 4,913) + 11 × 83,521\nN = 16 × 6,975,757,442 + 16 × 410,338,690 + 16 × 24,137,858 + 16 × 1,424,770 + 918,731\nN = 111,612,119,072 + 6,565,419,040 + 386,205,728 + 22,796,320 + 918,731\nN = 118,587,458,891\n\n<<<118587458891>>>"
