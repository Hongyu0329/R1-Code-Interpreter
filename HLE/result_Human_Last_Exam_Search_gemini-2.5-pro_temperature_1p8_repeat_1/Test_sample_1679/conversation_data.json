    "**\"An American in Paris,\" the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film to hold that honor and feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk.** The iconic Parisian landmark is showcased during the film's celebrated and lengthy ballet finale.\n\nThis climactic seventeen-minute sequence features an elaborate set designed to represent various famous locations in Paris. Among these is a detailed recreation of the Place de la Concorde, which prominently includes its famous fountain. The Luxor Obelisk, the central and most recognizable feature of the Place de la Concorde, is visible within this lavishly designed set. The scene involves Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron dancing around the fountain, firmly placing the Obelisk on-screen during this significant musical number. While much of \"An American in Paris\" was filmed on soundstages in Hollywood, the art direction, which won an Academy Award, painstakingly recreated the Parisian atmosphere, with the Place de la Concorde set being a key element of the film's visual splendor.\n\nEarlier Best Picture winners with scenes set in Paris, such as \"Wings\" (1927), \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937), and the Paris flashback in \"Casablanca\" (1943), did not feature the Place de la Concorde or its iconic obelisk. Later winners filmed in Paris, including \"Gigi\" (1958) and \"Funny Face\" (1957), also do not contain scenes that depict the Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
