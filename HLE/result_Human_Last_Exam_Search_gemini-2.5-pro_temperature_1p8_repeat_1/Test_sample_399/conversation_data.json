    "To solve the initial value problem, we first need to find the general solution of the differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the particular solution.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can separate the variables by moving all the terms involving *x* to one side and all the terms involving *t* to the other side.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n$$\nNow, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nThe integral of $1/x^2$ is $-1/x$. The integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNext, we use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of C. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\nNow we substitute the value of C back into the general solution to get the particular solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nWe need to find the value of $x(1)$, so we substitute $t=1$ into this equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo combine the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $x(1)$ by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
