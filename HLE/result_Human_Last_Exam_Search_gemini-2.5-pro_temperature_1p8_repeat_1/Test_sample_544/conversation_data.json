    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a type of Pummerer rearrangement. In this reaction, the sulfoxide is activated by the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This activation facilitates the elimination of a proton from the methyl group, leading to the formation of a key intermediate called a thionium ion.\n\nThe thionium ion is electrophilic and is subsequently attacked by the cyanide nucleophile, which is delivered from trimethylsilyl cyanide. This sequence of steps results in the formation of a new carbon-sulfur and carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final product of this reaction has the chemical structure Ph-S-CH2-CN.\n\nTo determine the IUPAC name of this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile group (-CN). The parent alkane chain including the carbon from the nitrile group is ethane. Therefore, the parent name is \"ethanenitrile.\"\n\nThe nitrile carbon is designated as position 1, and the adjacent carbon (the -CH2- group) is position 2. This second carbon atom is attached to a phenylthio (also known as phenylsulfanyl) group (Ph-S-). According to IUPAC nomenclature, this substituent is cited as a prefix. The preferred IUPAC name for the C6H5S- group is \"phenylsulfanyl\".\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the product is **2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile**. An alternative and commonly used name is **2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile**. For the common name, benzyl cyanide (phenylacetonitrile) has the structure Ph-CH2-CN, which is an isomer of the product but structurally different.\n\n<<<2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile>>>"
