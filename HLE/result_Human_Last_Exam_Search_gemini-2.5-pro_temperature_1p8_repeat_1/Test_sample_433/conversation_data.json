    "### No Storage Period for Opened Ampules in Sterile Environments\n\n**Once a single-dose glass ampule is opened, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period, regardless of whether it is in a sterile environment.** This is a firm guideline from United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>.\n\nThe critical difference between an ampule and a single-dose vial is that an ampule is an open-system container. Once the glass top is broken, there is no way to reseal it, leaving the contents exposed to the environment without any protection against microbial contamination. This holds true even in the highly controlled setting of an ISO Class 5 environment, commonly referred to as a sterile environment.\n\nIn contrast, single-dose *vials*, which have a rubber stopper that can be resealed with a needle puncture, may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry when punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, provided storage requirements are met. This distinction does not apply to ampules.\n\nRegulatory bodies and professional organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), expect compliance with these nationally recognized standards to ensure patient safety and the sterility of parenteral medications. Therefore, any remaining contents of a single-dose ampule must be discarded immediately after the required dose has been withdrawn.\n\n<<<A single-dose ampule, once punctured (opened), has no beyond-use date (BUD) and must be used immediately; it cannot be stored.>>>"
