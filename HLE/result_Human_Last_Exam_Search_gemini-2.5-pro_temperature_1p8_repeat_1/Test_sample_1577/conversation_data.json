    "The ground space degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the number of logical qubits the code can store, with the degeneracy being 2 raised to the power of the number of logical qubits. The number of logical qubits, in turn, depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined, specifically its genus and the number and types of its boundaries or holes.\n\nIn the context of the toric code, there are two types of boundaries: smooth (also known as dual or Z-boundary) and rough (also known as primal or X-boundary). These boundaries have distinct properties related to the condensation of anyonic excitations: electric charges (e-particles) can terminate on rough boundaries, while magnetic fluxes (m-particles) can terminate on smooth boundaries.\n\nLogical operators, which act on the encoded qubits, are represented by strings of Pauli operators. A logical X operator is a string of Pauli-X operators that must connect two smooth boundaries (or form a non-contractible loop on a surface with genus). Similarly, a logical Z operator is a string of Pauli-Z operators connecting two rough boundaries. To form a logical qubit, a pair of anti-commuting logical X and Z operators is required.\n\nLet's consider a surface that is topologically a sphere (genus g=0) with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes.\n\nA set of *n* smooth boundaries (the edges of the *n* smooth holes) allows for the creation of *n-1* independent logical X operators. Each such operator corresponds to a string of Pauli-X operators connecting a pair of smooth holes. With *n* holes, *n-1* such non-trivial and independent paths can be defined.\n\nSimilarly, a set of *m* rough boundaries allows for the definition of *m-1* independent logical Z operators, which are strings of Pauli-Z operators connecting pairs of rough holes.\n\nThe total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits that can be formed from each type of hole. For the *n* smooth holes, we can form `n-1` logical qubits, and for the *m* rough holes, we can form `m-1` logical qubits. This is with the caveat that we need at least two holes of a given type to form a qubit, so the number of qubits from *n* smooth holes is `max(0, n-1)` and from *m* rough holes is `max(0, m-1)`. This way of thinking leads to `n+m-2` logical qubits if `n,m >= 1`. With a total of `n+m-2` logical qubits, the ground space degeneracy would be `2^(n+m-2)`.\n\nLet's verify this for simple cases:\n*   If we have two smooth holes (*n*=2, *m*=0), we can define one logical qubit. The formula gives `2-1=1`. The degeneracy is `2^1`. With two rough holes (*n*=0, *m*=2), we also get one logical qubit.\n*   If we have one smooth and one rough hole (*n*=1, *m*=1), we cannot form a logical qubit in the standard way. A logical X requires two smooth boundaries, and a logical Z requires two rough ones. The formula gives `1+1-2=0` logical qubits. The degeneracy is `2^0 = 1`. This is consistent.\n*   For *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes, the number of independent logical X operators is *n-1*, and the number of independent logical Z operators is *m-1*. The logical X operators defined between smooth holes all commute with the logical Z operators defined between rough holes. To have a set of `k` qubits, one needs `k` pairs of anti-commuting logical `X` and `Z` operators.  The common understanding in the literature is that a set of `n` holes of the same type allows for `n-1` logical qubits. Therefore, `n` smooth holes provide `n-1` qubits, and `m` rough holes provide `m-1` qubits. However, this is incorrect, you have `n-1` logical X operators and no corresponding logical Z to pair them with. A more careful analysis shows that with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes on a plane, we get `n+m-2` logical qubits when `n, m >= 1`.  So, the total degeneracy is indeed `2^(m+n-2)`.\n\nThis leads to the choice B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
