    "To find the number of stable equilibrium points, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nEquilibrium points exist when $x'(t) = 0$. Let $x(t) = x$, so we need to solve the equation:\n$-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square:\n$-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0$\n\nThis equation gives us the equilibrium points:\n$x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. An equilibrium point $x_0$ is stable if trajectories starting near $x_0$ move towards $x_0$. A common method to test for stability is to analyze the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$, at the equilibrium points.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1$\n\n*   **Stability analysis for x = 0:**\n    Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point at $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n*   **Stability analysis for x = 1:**\n    Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 < 0$. This means that if the system is at a state slightly above 1, it will move towards 1 (since $x'$ is negative).\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 < 0$. This means that if the system is at a state slightly below 1, it will move away from 1 (since $x'$ is negative).\n\nFor an equilibrium point to be considered stable, trajectories on both sides of the point must converge to it. Since trajectories starting from below $x=1$ move away from it, the point $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium (it is considered semi-stable).\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, $x=0$. The number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$. Substituting the value of $m=1$:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<$1 - 2^{4048}$>>>"
