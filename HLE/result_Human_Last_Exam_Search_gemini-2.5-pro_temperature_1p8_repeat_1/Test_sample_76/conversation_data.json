    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, we are looking for integer solutions $(x, y)$ to the Diophantine equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\n\nLet $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. We need to find for which integer values of $x$ is $P(x)$ a perfect square.\n\nFirst, let's test some small integer values for $x$:\n- For $x=-4$: $P(-4) = (-4)^3 - 16(-4)^2 - 72(-4) + 1056 = -64 - 256 + 288 + 1056 = 1024 = 32^2$. So, $x=-4$ is a solution.\n- For $x=4$: $P(4) = 4^3 - 16(4)^2 - 72(4) + 1056 = 64 - 256 - 288 + 1056 = 576 = 24^2$. So, $x=4$ is a solution.\n- For $x=17$: $P(17) = 17^3 - 16(17)^2 - 72(17) + 1056 = 17^2(17-16) - 1224 + 1056 = 289 - 168 = 121 = 11^2$. So, $x=17$ is a solution.\n\nTo determine if there are other solutions, we need to understand the behavior of the polynomial $P(x)$. The sign of $P(x)$ depends on its roots. The roots of $P(x)=0$ are approximately $x_1 \\approx -8.23$, $x_2 \\approx 7.73$, and $x_3 \\approx 16.5$.\n$P(x)$ is positive for $x$ in the intervals $(-8.23, 7.73)$ and $(16.5, \\infty)$. We are looking for integer values of $x$ in these ranges.\n\nThe integer values of $x$ to check are therefore in the set $\\{-8, -7, \\dots, 7\\}$ and $\\{17, 18, \\dots\\}$.\n\nWe have already checked some of these values and found solutions at $x=-4$ and $x=4$. Other integer values in this range, such as $x=0$, for which $P(0)=1056$, do not yield a perfect square. A systematic check of the integers from -8 to 7 confirms that only -4 and 4 are solutions in this range. For $x$ values between 8 and 16 (inclusive), $P(x)$ is negative and thus cannot be a perfect square. For instance, $P(8) = -32$ and $P(16)=-96$.\n\nNow, we need to consider $x \\ge 17$. We already found that $x=17$ is a solution.\nFor large values of $x$, we can bound the expression. Let's analyze the expression for $x y^2$:\n$xy^2 = x(x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056) = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1056x$.\nFor large $x$, we can compare this to the square of a polynomial in $x$.\nConsider the polynomial $Q(x) = x^2 - 8x - 68$. Its square is:\n$(x^2 - 8x - 68)^2 = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1088x + 4624$.\nAnd the square of the next smaller integer polynomial is:\n$(x^2 - 8x - 69)^2 = x^4 - 16x^3 - 74x^2 + 1104x + 4489$.\n\nFor $x > 0$, we have $xy^2 = (x^2 - 8x - 68)^2 - 32x - 4624$, which is less than $(x^2 - 8x - 68)^2$.\nAlso, $xy^2 - (x^2 - 8x - 69)^2 = 2x^2 - 48x - 4489$. The quadratic $2x^2 - 48x - 4489$ is positive for $x \\ge 61$.\nThis means for $x \\ge 61$, we have $(x^2-8x-69)^2 < xy^2 < (x^2-8x-68)^2$.\nThis implies that for $x \\ge 61$, $xy^2$ lies strictly between two consecutive perfect squares, and therefore cannot be a perfect square itself.\nIf $xy^2$ is not a perfect square, then $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ cannot be a perfect square for an integer $x$. This is because if $x$ is not a square itself, or has a square-free part, $xy^2$ cannot be a square. If $x$ is a square, say $x=k^2$, then $xy^2 = (ky)^2$, which is a perfect square. However, we have shown that for $x=k^2 \\ge 61$, $xy^2$ is not a perfect square. Thus, there are no solutions for $x \\ge 61$.\n\nThis leaves the range of integers $x \\in$ to check. Checking these values reveals no other perfect squares. For example:\n- $P(18) = 408$\n- $P(28) = 8448$\n- $P(44) = 52096$\n- $P(60) = 155136$\n\nTherefore, the only integer values of $x$ for which the given expression is a perfect square are -4, 4, and 17.\n\nThere are 3 such integer values of $x$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
