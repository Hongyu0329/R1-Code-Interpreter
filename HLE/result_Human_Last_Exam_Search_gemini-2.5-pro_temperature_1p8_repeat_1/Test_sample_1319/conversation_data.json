    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Ida on the island of Crete.\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in Homer's epic poem and the broader Greek mythology surrounding the Trojan War. To determine the tallest among them, their elevations must be compared.\n\nThe primary mountains mentioned are:\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The highest mountain in Greece, standing at approximately 2,918 meters (9,573 feet), it was the mythological home of the gods.\n*   **Mount Ida (Crete):** This is the highest mountain on the island of Crete, with an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). In mythology, it is renowned as the birthplace of Zeus.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located in northeastern Greece, this mountain reaches a height of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). Homer mentions Mount Athos in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Mount Ida (Turkey):** Situated near the ancient city of Troy (modern-day Turkey), this mountain's peak is 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). From here, the gods were said to have watched the Trojan War, and it played a significant role in the epic's narrative.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Found in southeastern Thessaly, its highest point is 1,624 meters (5,328 ft). It was known in mythology as the home of the Centaurs.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Saos/Fengari):** The tallest peak on the island of Samothrace, it stands at 1,611 meters (5,285 feet). According to legend, Poseidon observed the Trojan War from its summit.\n\nWhile the Mount Ida in Turkey is more central to the direct narrative of the Trojan War, both mountains named Ida are referenced in the broader mythology of which the *Iliad* is a key part. Comparing their heights, Mount Ida on Crete is the tallest of these historical mountains after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
