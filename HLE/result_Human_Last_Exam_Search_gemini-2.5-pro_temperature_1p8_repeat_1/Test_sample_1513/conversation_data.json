    "Hanga Roa, the main town and capital of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), is the island town that meets these specific criteria.\n\nEaster Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. It is approximately 2,088 kilometers (about 1,300 miles) from the nearest inhabited island, Pitcairn Island, well exceeding the 500-kilometer requirement.\n\nThe town of Hanga Roa is situated on the island's west coast. Its name in the Rapa Nui language translates to \"long bay\" or \"wide bay,\" and the town is located on the bay that shares its name. Easter Island itself was formed by three extinct volcanoes, and Hanga Roa lies in the lowlands between two of these, Terevaka and Rano Kau. The bay of Hanga Roa is a direct result of the island's volcanic origins.\n\nWhile other remote volcanic islands with settlements exist, such as Pitcairn Island and Tristan da Cunha, they do not meet all the specified conditions. On Pitcairn Island, the settlement of Adamstown is located above Bounty Bay, so the names of the town and bay are different. On Tristan da Cunha, the settlement is named Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, and while it's on a bay, there is no indication that the bay is a caldera or that it shares the same name.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa"
