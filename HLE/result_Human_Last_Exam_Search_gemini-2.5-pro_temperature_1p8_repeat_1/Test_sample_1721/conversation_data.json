    "The largest number $c$ for which there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ such that the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis can be shown through a two-part argument involving a construction for the lower bound and a theorem for the upper bound.\n\n### Lower Bound: $c \\ge \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nA set $A$ can be constructed with a density of $\\frac{1}{3}$ such that $A+A$ contains no squares. Consider the set $A$ consisting of all integers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3:\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\}$\n\nThe size of this set is approximately $|A| \\approx \\frac{N}{3}$. For any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nThe squares modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1$. Therefore, any number that is congruent to 2 modulo 3 cannot be a perfect square. Since all elements of the sumset $A+A$ are congruent to 2 modulo 3, $A+A$ contains no square numbers. This construction demonstrates that a density of $c = \\frac{1}{3}$ is achievable.\n\n### Upper Bound: $c \\le \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nThe problem of finding the maximum density of a set whose sumset avoids squares is a known problem in additive combinatorics. A significant result in this area, attributed to Imre Ruzsa, states that a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ for which $A+A$ contains no squares can have a size of at most $\\frac{N}{3} + O(\\sqrt{N})$.\n\nThis result implies that the asymptotic density of such a set cannot exceed $\\frac{1}{3}$. In the notation of the question, this means $|A|/N \\le \\frac{1}{3} + o(1)$, which establishes that $c \\le \\frac{1}{3}$. A related problem concerning square-free sumsets was addressed by graph-theoretic methods, leading to a density of 11/32 for a different problem variant. However, for the specific question asked, Ruzsa's result is the most direct.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, it is concluded that the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
