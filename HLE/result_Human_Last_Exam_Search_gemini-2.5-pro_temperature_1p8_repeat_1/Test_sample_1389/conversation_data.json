    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is a type of vaccine that provides complete protection to some recipients while offering no protection to others. For those who are protected, the risk of infection upon exposure is zero. For those who are not, the risk is the same as for an unvaccinated person. In this context, vaccine efficacy represents the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected.\n\nVaccine efficacy is commonly calculated as 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (IRR). The IRR is the incidence rate in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n\nIn the all-or-nothing model, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group is determined by the proportion of individuals who are not protected. If a fraction of vaccinated individuals, VE (vaccine efficacy), is fully protected, then the remaining fraction, 1-VE, is still susceptible. Consequently, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group is (1-VE) times the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n\nTherefore, the IRR can be expressed as:\nIRR = (Incidence Rate Vaccinated) / (Incidence Rate Unvaccinated) = [(1-VE) * Incidence Rate Unvaccinated] / (Incidence Rate Unvaccinated) = 1-VE\n\nFrom this, the vaccine efficacy calculated from the incidence rate is:\n1 - IRR = 1 - (1-VE) = VE\n\nThis calculation of vaccine efficacy directly corresponds to the proportion of the vaccinated population that is completely protected, which is the definition of per-exposure efficacy in an all-or-nothing model. Thus, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the 1-incidence rate ratio correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
