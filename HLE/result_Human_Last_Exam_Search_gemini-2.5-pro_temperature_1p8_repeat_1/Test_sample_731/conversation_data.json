    "In the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, there are 9 power subgroups.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n### 1. Definition and Presentation of the Semidihedral Group\nThe semidihedral group of order 2<sup>n</sup>, denoted SD<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub>, has the following presentation:\nSD<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub> = ⟨r, s | r<sup>2<sup>n-1</sup></sup> = s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>2<sup>n-2</sup>-1</sup>⟩\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, we have 2<sup>n</sup> = 512, so n = 9. The presentation for SD<sub>512</sub> is:\nSD<sub>512</sub> = ⟨r, s | r<sup>256</sup> = s<sup>2</sup> = 1, srs = r<sup>127</sup>⟩\n\nThe elements of this group consist of two types:\n*   Elements of the cyclic subgroup ⟨r⟩, which are of the form r<sup>i</sup> for 0 ≤ i < 256.\n*   The remaining 256 elements, which are of the form r<sup>i</sup>s for 0 ≤ i < 256.\n\n### 2. Definition of a Power Subgroup\nA power subgroup G<sup>k</sup> is the subgroup generated by the set of all k-th powers of the elements in the group G.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Powers of Elements in SD_512\nWe need to determine the result of raising each element to the k-th power.\n\n*   For elements of the form r<sup>i</sup>, the k-th power is simply (r<sup>i</sup>)<sup>k</sup> = r<sup>ik</sup>.\n*   For elements of the form r<sup>i</sup>s, we first compute the square:\n    (r<sup>i</sup>s)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>i</sup>sr<sup>i</sup>s = r<sup>i</sup>(srs)<sup>i</sup> = r<sup>i</sup>(r<sup>127</sup>)<sup>i</sup> = r<sup>i</sup>r<sup>127i</sup> = r<sup>128i</sup>.\n\n### 4. Identifying the Set of Power Subgroups\nAny positive integer k can be written as k = 2<sup>j</sup>m, where m is an odd number and j ≥ 0.\n\nIn a 2-group (a group where every element's order is a power of 2), the mapping x ↦ x<sup>m</sup> for any odd integer m is a permutation of the group's elements. This implies that the subgroup generated by all m-th powers is the group itself (G<sup>m</sup> = G).\n\nTherefore, for any k = 2<sup>j</sup>m, the power subgroup G<sup>k</sup> is:\nG<sup>k</sup> = G<sup>2<sup>j</sup>m</sup> = (G<sup>m</sup>)<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup> = G<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>\n\nThis means we only need to identify the distinct subgroups of the form G<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>.\n\nLet's calculate these subgroups:\n*   **j = 0 (k=1):** G<sup>1</sup> = G = SD<sub>512</sub>.\n*   **j = 1 (k=2):** G<sup>2</sup> is generated by the squares of all elements.\n    *   (r<sup>i</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2i</sup>. These generate the cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>2</sup>⟩, which has order 128.\n    *   (r<sup>i</sup>s)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>128i</sup>. If i is odd, this is r<sup>128</sup>, which is in ⟨r<sup>2</sup>⟩. If i is even, this is the identity element.\n    *   Thus, G<sup>2</sup> = ⟨r<sup>2</sup>⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 128.\n*   **j = 2 (k=4):** G<sup>4</sup> is generated by the 4th powers of all elements.\n    *   (r<sup>i</sup>)<sup>4</sup> = r<sup>4i</sup>. These generate the cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>4</sup>⟩ of order 64.\n    *   (r<sup>i</sup>s)<sup>4</sup> = ((r<sup>i</sup>s)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = (r<sup>128i</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>256i</sup> = 1.\n    *   Thus, G<sup>4</sup> = ⟨r<sup>4</sup>⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n*   **For j ≥ 2:** G<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup> is generated by (r<sup>i</sup>)<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup> = r<sup>i2<sup>j</sup></sup> and (r<sup>i</sup>s)<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>.\n    *   (r<sup>i</sup>s)<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup> = ((r<sup>128i</sup>)<sup>2</sup>...) = r<sup>i * 128 * 2<sup>j-1</sup></sup> = r<sup>i * 2<sup>7</sup> * 2<sup>j-1</sup></sup> = r<sup>i * 2<sup>j+6</sup></sup>. Since j ≥ 2, j+6 ≥ 8, so i * 2<sup>j+6</sup> is a multiple of 256. Hence, (r<sup>i</sup>s)<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup> = 1.\n    *   Therefore, for j ≥ 1, the power subgroup G<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup> is equal to the cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>2<sup>j</sup></sup>⟩.\n\n### 5. Listing the Distinct Power Subgroups\nWe can now list all the distinct power subgroups by considering the values of j:\n\n*   **j = 0:** G<sup>1</sup> = SD<sub>512</sub> (order 512)\n*   **j = 1:** G<sup>2</sup> = ⟨r<sup>2</sup>⟩ (cyclic of order 128)\n*   **j = 2:** G<sup>4</sup> = ⟨r<sup>4</sup>⟩ (cyclic of order 64)\n*   **j = 3:** G<sup>8</sup> = ⟨r<sup>8</sup>⟩ (cyclic of order 32)\n*   **j = 4:** G<sup>16</sup> = ⟨r<sup>16</sup>⟩ (cyclic of order 16)\n*   **j = 5:** G<sup>32</sup> = ⟨r<sup>32</sup>⟩ (cyclic of order 8)\n*   **j = 6:** G<sup>64</sup> = ⟨r<sup>64</sup>⟩ (cyclic of order 4)\n*   **j = 7:** G<sup>128</sup> = ⟨r<sup>128</sup>⟩ (cyclic of order 2)\n*   **j = 8:** G<sup>256</sup> = ⟨r<sup>256</sup>⟩ = {e} (the trivial subgroup of order 1)\n\nThese 9 subgroups are all distinct, as they have different orders. Any higher power of 2 for k will also result in the trivial subgroup.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
