    "There are five distinct types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, not including the smooth curve itself. These correspond to the different ways a smooth genus 2 curve can degenerate into a singular stable curve. Such singular curves are composed of simpler components, specifically elliptic curves (genus 1) and rational curves (genus 0), connected at points called nodes.\n\nThe five types of stable reduction are categorized by their topological structure, which can be visualized using dual graphs. In this representation, each component of the curve is a vertex, and each node connecting two components is an edge. A node connecting a component to itself is represented as a loop.\n\nThe types of stable reduction for a genus 2 curve are:\n\n*   **Curves with one node:**\n    1.  An irreducible curve with one node, whose normalization (the curve obtained by \"un-pinching\" the node) is an elliptic curve.\n    2.  A reducible curve consisting of two elliptic curves intersecting at a single node.\n\n*   **Curves with two nodes:**\n    3.  An irreducible curve with two nodes, whose normalization is a rational curve (a projective line).\n    4.  A curve made of an elliptic component and a rational component, where the rational component has a node and is attached to the elliptic curve at another point.\n\n*   **Curves with three nodes:**\n    5.  A reducible curve consisting of two rational curves that are connected to each other at three distinct points.\n\nThese five singular configurations represent the boundary strata of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of genus 2 curves, $\\overline{M_2}$. Each type corresponds to a unique combinatorial arrangement of lower-genus curves and nodes that results in a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2. Any further degeneration would either result in an unstable curve or a curve of a different genus.\n\n<<<5>>>"
