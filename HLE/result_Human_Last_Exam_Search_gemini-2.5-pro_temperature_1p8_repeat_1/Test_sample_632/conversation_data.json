    "After extensive research into the architectural history of the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, there is no evidence to suggest that a unique architectural feature was removed from the square by the city administration in 1950.\n\nHistorical records and urban planning documents indicate that the most significant alterations to the Piazza della Rotonda took place in the 19th century. During this period, a series of demolitions were carried out to clear the area around the Pantheon of the medieval and Renaissance-era market stalls, small shops, and some buildings that had grown up around it over the centuries. This \"liberation\" of the Pantheon was intended to provide a more open and monumental view of the ancient temple.\n\nWhile 20th-century master plans for Rome, including the one from 1931, included proposals for further modifications in the area, there is no specific record of a significant architectural feature being removed from the piazza itself in the year 1950. It is possible that minor alterations or demolitions of nearby buildings occurred around this time as part of the post-war urban development of Rome, but no documentation points to the removal of a \"unique architectural feature\" from the Piazza della Rotonda in that particular year. Therefore, the premise of the question cannot be confirmed.\n\n<<<Based on the available information, there is no evidence of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. Major demolitions in the square to clear the area around the Pantheon occurred in the 19th century.>>>"
