    "### Partition Function in the Grand Canonical Ensemble via Path Integrals\n\nThe partition function, Z, for a system in the grand canonical ensemble is defined as the trace of the statistical operator, which is given by:\n\nZ = Tr(e<sup>-β(Ĥ - μN̂)</sup>)\n\nHere, β is the inverse temperature (1/k<sub>B</sub>T), Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator, μ is the chemical potential, and N̂ is the particle number operator.\n\nFor the specific case where the Hamiltonian is given by Ĥ = -μN̂, the expression for the partition function simplifies. The operator in the exponent becomes:\n\nK̂ = Ĥ - μN̂ = -μN̂ - μN̂ = -2μN̂\n\nTherefore, the partition function is:\n\nZ = Tr(e<sup>2βμN̂</sup>)\n\nThis trace can be evaluated by summing over a complete set of states, for instance, the eigenstates of the number operator, |N⟩. This yields:\n\nZ = &sum;<sub>N=0</sub><sup>&infin;</sup> ⟨N|e<sup>2βμN̂</sup>|N⟩ = &sum;<sub>N=0</sub><sup>&infin;</sup>; e<sup>2βμN</sup>\n\nThis is a geometric series which converges if e<sup>2βμ</sup> < 1, which implies that the chemical potential μ must be negative.\n\n#### Path Integral Formulation\n\nThe trace of an operator can be expressed as a path integral over fields. This formulation is particularly powerful in quantum field theory and many-body physics. The details of the path integral depend on whether the particles in the system are bosons or fermions.\n\nTo construct the path integral, we first express the number operator in terms of creation (a<sup>&dagger;</sup>) and annihilation (a) operators for each single-particle state *k*:\n\nN̂ = &sum;<sub>k</sub> â<sup>&dagger;</sup><sub>k</sub>â<sub>k</sub>\n\nThe partition function can then be written as:\n\nZ = Tr[exp(2βμ &sum;<sub>k</sub> â<sup>&dagger;</sup><sub>k</sub>â<sub>k</sub>)] = &prod;<sub>k</sub> Tr[exp(2βμ â<sup>&dagger;</sup><sub>k</sub>â<sub>k</sub>)]\n\nThis shows that the total partition function is a product of the partition functions for each individual mode *k*. We can now evaluate the trace for a single mode using the path integral formalism.\n\nThe path integral is constructed using coherent states. For a single mode, the trace operation leads to an integral over a complex field &phi;(&tau;) that is periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in imaginary time &tau; over the interval [0, &beta;]. The general form of the path integral for the grand canonical partition function is:\n\nZ = &int; D[&phi;<sup>*</sup>,&phi;] e<sup>-S[&phi;<sup>*</sup>,&phi;]</sup>\n\nwhere S[&phi;<sup>*</sup>,&phi;] is the action. The action for this system is given by:\n\nS = &int;<sub>0</sub><sup>&beta;</sup> d&tau; &sum;<sub>k</sub> [ &phi;<sub>k</sub><sup>*</sup>(&tau;)&part;<sub>&tau;</sub>&phi;<sub>k</sub>(&tau;) - 2μ&phi;<sub>k</sub><sup>*</sup>(&tau;)&phi;<sub>k</sub>(&tau;) ]\n\nThis is a quadratic (Gaussian) path integral which can be evaluated exactly. The calculation typically proceeds by expanding the fields in a Fourier series over the imaginary time interval, which diagonalizes the action. The final result depends on the statistics of the particles.\n\n**For Bosons:**\nThe periodic boundary conditions for bosonic fields lead to the following partition function for each mode *k*:\n\nZ<sub>k</sub> = (1 - e<sup>2βμ</sup>)<sup>-1</sup>\n\nThe total partition function is the product over all modes:\n\nZ<sub>bosons</sub> = &prod;<sub>k</sub> (1 - e<sup>2βμ</sup>)<sup>-1</sup>\n\n**For Fermions:**\nThe anti-periodic boundary conditions for fermionic fields (represented by Grassmann numbers) result in:\n\nZ<sub>k</sub> = 1 + e<sup>2βμ</sup>\n\nThe total partition function is then:\n\nZ<sub>fermions</sub> = &prod;<sub>k</sub> (1 + e<sup>2βμ</sup>)\n\nThese results from the path integral formalism are consistent with a direct evaluation of the trace in the occupation number basis for each mode.\n\nIn summary, the partition function for the given Hamiltonian, when evaluated using the path integral method, yields a result that depends on the quantum statistics of the constituent particles.\n\n<<<\nThe partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂ in the grand canonical ensemble is Z = Tr(e<sup>-β(Ĥ - μN̂)</sup>) = Tr(e<sup>2βμN̂</sup>).  Using a path integral formulation, this can be evaluated for both bosonic and fermionic systems.\n\nThe result is a product over all single-particle states *k*.\n\nFor a system of **bosons**, the partition function is:\nZ<sub>bosons</sub> = &prod;<sub>k</sub> (1 - e<sup>2βμ</sup>)<sup>-1</sup>\n\nFor a system of **fermions**, the partition function is:\nZ<sub>fermions</sub> = &prod;<sub>k</sub> (1 + e<sup>2βμ</sup>)\n>>>"
