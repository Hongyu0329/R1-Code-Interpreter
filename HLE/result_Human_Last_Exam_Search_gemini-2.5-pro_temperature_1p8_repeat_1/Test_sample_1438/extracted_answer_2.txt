The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a single number, but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration. For a single Grassmann variable \( \theta \), these rules are \( \int d\theta = 0 \) and \( \int \theta \, d\theta = 1 \). The anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables, which leads to \( \theta^2 = 0 \), is the direct mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle within this formalism.
