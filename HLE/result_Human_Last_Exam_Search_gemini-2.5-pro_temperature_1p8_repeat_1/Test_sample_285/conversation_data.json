    "Let the integral be denoted by $I(\\mathbf{a})$, where $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \\dots, a_9) \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$. We want to find the largest value of $p$ such that the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ diverges, meaning $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$.\n\nThe asymptotic behavior of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ for large $|\\mathbf{a}|$ determines its membership in $L^p$ spaces. The decay rate of such oscillatory integrals is understood through the method of stationary phase and the van der Corput lemma. The decay is slowest when the phase polynomial is as \"flat\" as possible near a point, a condition described by the degeneracy of the polynomial's critical points.\n\nThe phase is a general cubic polynomial in two variables:\n$P(x,y) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nThe $L^p$ integrability of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ over $\\mathbb{R}^9$ is determined by the \"worst-case\" behavior, i.e., the slowest rate of decay of $|I(\\mathbf{a})|$. The overall integrability of a function is limited by its behavior on the subspaces where its tails are \"fattest.\" To find the critical exponent $p$, we can analyze the integrability of $I$ over various subspaces of the coefficient space $\\mathbb{R}^9$. If the integral over any subspace diverges for a certain $p$, then the integral over the entire space also diverges.\n\nWe can analyze the decay of the integral $I(\\mathbf{a})$ along specific directions in the 9-dimensional space of coefficients.\nLet's consider the subspace where only the cubic homogeneous terms are non-zero: $\\mathbf{a}_c = (a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9)$. Let $I_c(\\mathbf{a}_c) = I(0,0,0,0,0,a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9)$.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $I_c$ for large $|\\mathbf{a}_c|$. Let $\\mathbf{a}_c = \\lambda \\mathbf{c}$, where $\\mathbf{c}$ is a unit vector.\n$I_c(\\lambda\\mathbf{c}) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i \\lambda (c_6 x^3 + c_7 x^2 y + c_8 x y^2 + c_9 y^3)} dx dy$.\nBy making a change of variables $x = u\\lambda^{-1/3}, y = v\\lambda^{-1/3}$, we can analyze the asymptotic behavior as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. The integral transforms to:\n$I_c(\\lambda\\mathbf{c}) = \\lambda^{-2/3} \\int_{[0, \\lambda^{1/3}]^2} e^{2\\pi i P_{\\mathbf{c}}(u,v)} du dv$, where $P_{\\mathbf{c}}$ is the cubic form with coefficients $c_j$.\nFor a generic choice of coefficients $\\mathbf{c}$, the integral over the expanding square converges to a non-zero constant. Thus, for generic directions $\\mathbf{c}$, the decay rate is $\\lambda^{-2/3}$. So, $|I_c(\\mathbf{a}_c)| \\sim |\\mathbf{a}_c|^{-2/3}$.\n\nNow we check the convergence of $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^4} |I_c(\\mathbf{a}_c)|^p d\\mathbf{a}_c$. Using polar coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, the volume element is $\\lambda^3 d\\lambda d\\mathbf{\\omega}$. The integral becomes:\n$\\int_{S^3} \\int_0^\\infty |I_c(\\lambda\\mathbf{\\omega})|^p \\lambda^3 d\\lambda d\\mathbf{\\omega}$.\nFor generic directions $\\omega$, this is approximately $\\int_0^\\infty (\\lambda^{-2/3})^p \\lambda^3 d\\lambda = \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda^{3-2p/3} d\\lambda$.\nThis integral diverges at infinity if the exponent is greater than or equal to -1.\n$3 - \\frac{2p}{3} \\ge -1 \\implies 4 \\ge \\frac{2p}{3} \\implies 12 \\ge 2p \\implies p \\le 6$.\n\nSince the integral over the 4-dimensional subspace of cubic coefficients diverges for $p \\le 6$, the integral over the full 9-dimensional space also diverges for these values of $p$. This implies that for $p \\le 6$, the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$.\n\nWhile specific degenerate directions within the cubic subspace (like considering only the $a_6 x^3$ term) lead to slower decay rates per coefficient (e.g., $|a_6|^{-1/3}$ vs. $|\\mathbf{a}_c|^{-2/3}$), the analysis of the integrability over the entire subspace considers the contribution from all its dimensions. The generic directions occupy a set of full measure in this subspace, and their behavior dictates the integrability.\n\nThe argument for the cubic subspace provides the most stringent condition found. For the function $I$ not to be in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need the integral of $|I|^p$ to diverge. The divergence of the integral over the cubic coefficient subspace for $p \\le 6$ is sufficient to show this. Thus, the set of $p$ for which $I \\notin L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is $(-\\infty, 6]$. The largest value in this set is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
