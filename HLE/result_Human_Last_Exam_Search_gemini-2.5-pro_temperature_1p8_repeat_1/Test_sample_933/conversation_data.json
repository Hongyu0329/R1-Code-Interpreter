    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly and efficiently synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases. This reaction is typically conducted by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container.\n\nThe optimal temperature for this synthesis is widely cited as 400°C. This temperature ensures an efficient reaction to form XeF₄. While the reaction can occur over a range of temperatures, typically between 350°C and 450°C, 400°C is the standard for efficient production. Lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂), while higher temperatures are more conducive to producing xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\nOther methods, such as using an electric discharge at lower temperatures, have been mentioned, but these often result in significant impurities of XeF₂. Although some reaction has been observed at temperatures as low as 270°C, 400°C remains the benchmark for efficient and reliable synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
