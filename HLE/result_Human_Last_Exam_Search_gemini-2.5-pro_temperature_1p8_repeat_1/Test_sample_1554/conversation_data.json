    "**Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a leading figure in the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy, is the philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a sign into categories including symptoms and signals.**\n\nA prominent Polish logician and philosopher, Ajdukiewicz made significant contributions to the field of semiotics, the study of signs. In his analysis of language and meaning, he distinguished between different types of signs.\n\nAccording to the analysis of Ajdukiewicz's work by fellow Polish semiotician Jerzy Pelc, Ajdukiewicz identified a \"symptom\" (or \"indication\") as a state of affairs that naturally points to another state of affairs. For example, a falling barometer is a symptom that it is going to rain.\n\nIn contrast, Ajdukiewicz defined a \"signal\" as an artificially created phenomenon that, based on a known convention, leads to a conclusion or a decision. Sentences themselves, as physical phenomena, are considered by Ajdukiewicz to be indications, though not necessarily signals, of the speaker's thoughts. While the term \"hallmark\" does not appear to be the specific technical term used by Ajdukiewicz in this context, his work clearly involves the conceptual breakdown of signs into symptoms and signals. His primary interests lay in semiotics and epistemology.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
