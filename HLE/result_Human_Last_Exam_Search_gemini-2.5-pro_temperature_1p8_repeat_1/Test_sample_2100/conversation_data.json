    "Andrei Voznesensky's poem refers to Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nThe answer to the question of Rezanov's final resting place emerged in the latter part of the 20th century. After his death in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, he was buried in the cemetery of the Resurrection Cathedral. However, the cathedral was destroyed in the 1950s, and his grave was considered lost. Later, his remains were reportedly moved to the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk. A memorial service and the dedication of a new white cross monument at his grave took place on October 28, 2000. This event symbolically reconnected him with his beloved, Concepción Argüello, as soil and a rose from her grave in Benicia, California, were brought to his burial site.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
