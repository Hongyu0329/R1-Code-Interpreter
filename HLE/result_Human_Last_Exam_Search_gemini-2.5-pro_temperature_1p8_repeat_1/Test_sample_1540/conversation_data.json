    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, along with an analysis of its memory usage.\n\n### C Program\n\nThe strategy for the most memory-efficient solution is to avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously. We can read the first string into a buffer. Then, we can read the second string one character at a time from the input stream and compare it on-the-fly with the corresponding character from the first string's buffer.\n\nThis approach significantly reduces memory by not requiring a second buffer for the other string.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program lexicographically compares two strings of the same length,\n * ignoring case, with a focus on memory efficiency.\n *\n * It works by reading the first string into a single buffer. The second string is not\n * stored in a buffer; instead, it's read character by character from standard input\n * and compared directly against the characters in the first string's buffer.\n *\n * This method avoids the memory allocation for a second large buffer, making it highly\n * memory-efficient.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    /*\n     * Variable Memory Allocation Analysis:\n     *\n     * 1. char s1[101]: A buffer to store the first string. The maximum length is 100,\n     *    plus one byte for the null terminator ('\\0').\n     *    Total size: 101 * sizeof(char) = 101 bytes.\n     *\n     * 2. int c: A variable to hold characters read from the second string using getchar().\n     *    It is declared as `int` to properly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) value,\n     *    which is a negative integer and would not fit in a `char`.\n     *    Total size: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes (on typical 32/64-bit systems).\n     *\n     * 3. unsigned char i: An index for iterating over the first string `s1`.\n     *    Since the maximum string length is 100, `unsigned char` (range 0-255) is\n     *    sufficient and more memory-efficient than `int`.\n     *    Total size: sizeof(unsigned char) = 1 byte.\n     *\n     * Total variable memory (m) = 101 + 4 + 1 = 106 bytes.\n    */\n    char s1[101];\n    int c;\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Read the first string into its buffer.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Consume any whitespace characters (e.g., the newline) that separate\n    // the first and second strings in the input stream.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF && isspace(c));\n\n    // Loop through the first string. The loop implicitly relies on the guarantee\n    // that the second string has the same length. The loop terminates when the\n    // end of the first string is reached.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Compare the lowercase versions of the characters.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)c)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as a difference is found.\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)c)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as a difference is found.\n        }\n        \n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n        c = getchar();\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this program is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: This array stores the first string and requires `101 bytes`.\n*   **`int c`**: This variable is used to read characters from the input stream (including `EOF`) and requires `4 bytes` on a standard system.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: This index variable requires `1 byte`.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 4 + 1 = **106 bytes**.\n\n<<<106>>>"
