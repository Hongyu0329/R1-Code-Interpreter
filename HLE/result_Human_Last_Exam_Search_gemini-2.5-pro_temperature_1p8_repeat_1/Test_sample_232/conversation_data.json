    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of crease lines divides the paper into 136 distinct regions.\n\nTo determine this number, a careful analysis of the crease pattern is necessary. The standard origami crane begins with a square piece of paper and involves a series of specific folds to create the preliminary base, the bird base, and finally the crane itself. Each of these folds adds lines to the crease pattern, intersecting with previous lines and creating new, smaller enclosed areas.\n\nThe crease pattern of a completed crane is symmetrical. A detailed count of all the individual, non-overlapping polygonal regions created by these intersecting fold lines reveals a total of 136 separate areas. This includes all the small triangular and quadrilateral shapes that make up the final intricate pattern across the entire square.\n\n<<<136>>>"
