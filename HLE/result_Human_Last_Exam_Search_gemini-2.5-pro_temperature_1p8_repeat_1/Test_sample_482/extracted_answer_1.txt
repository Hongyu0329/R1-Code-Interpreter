The critical amount of correlation required to balance potentiation and depression, irrespective of the specific synaptic weight values, is a Pearson correlation coefficient of 1 between the corresponding neurons in the input populations `v` and `s`. This means the inputs `v_k` and `s_k` must be perfectly correlated.
