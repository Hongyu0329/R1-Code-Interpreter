    "An analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the large $x$ regime can be found by analyzing the dominant terms of the equation.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nGiven the initial conditions, particularly $y'(0) = 3.00$, the solution is expected to grow rapidly. This suggests that the term $y'$ and its derivatives, along with $y$ itself, will become large. This often leads to a solution that develops a singularity at a finite value of $x$, say $x_0$. This \"blow-up\" scenario constitutes the relevant \"large $x$ regime\" for this problem.\n\nAs $x$ approaches $x_0$, we analyze the order of magnitude of each term. Let's assume the solution behaves as $y(x) \\sim (x_0 - x)^{-n}$ for some $n > 0$. The derivatives will behave as:\n*   $y'(x) \\sim (x_0 - x)^{-n-1}$\n*   $y''(x) \\sim (x_0 - x)^{-n-2}$\n*   $y'''(x) \\sim (x_0 - x)^{-n-3}$\n\nThe terms on the right-hand side of the ODE have the following behavior:\n*   $y^4 \\sim (x_0 - x)^{-4n}$\n*   $(y')^4 \\sim (x_0 - x)^{-4n-4}$\n*   The terms $-\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ are less singular compared to the powers of $y$ and its derivatives near the singularity.\n\nTo find the dominant balance, we equate the most singular terms. The term $(y')^4$ with its $(x_0 - x)^{-4n-4}$ dependence is the most singular term on the right-hand side. The dominant balance must therefore be between $y'''$ and $(y')^4$:\n$y''' \\approx (y')^4$\n\nLet's seek a solution for this simplified equation of the form $y'(x) = B(x_0 - x)^{-p}$. Differentiating twice gives:\n*   $y''(x) = Bp(x_0-x)^{-p-1}$\n*   $y'''(x) = Bp(p+1)(x_0-x)^{-p-2}$\n\nSubstituting into the balance equation $(y')^4 = y'''$:\n$(B(x_0-x)^{-p})^4 = Bp(p+1)(x_0-x)^{-p-2}$\n$B^4(x_0-x)^{-4p} = Bp(p+1)(x_0-x)^{-p-2}$\n\nEquating the exponents of $(x_0-x)$:\n$-4p = -p-2 \\implies 3p = 2 \\implies p = 2/3$.\n\nEquating the coefficients:\n$B^4 = Bp(p+1) \\implies B^3 = p(p+1)$\n$B^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}+1\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{10}{9}$\n$B = \\sqrt{10/9}$\n\nSo, the approximation for $y'(x)$ is:\n$y'(x) \\approx \\sqrt{10/9}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$\n\nTo find $y(x)$, we integrate $y'(x)$:\n$y(x) \\approx \\int \\sqrt{10/9}(x_0-x)^{-2/3} dx = -\\sqrt{10/9} \\frac{(x_0-x)^{1/3}}{1/3} + C$\n$y(x) \\approx C - 3\\sqrt{10/9}(x_0-x)^{1/3}$\n\nHere, $C$ and $x_0$ are constants of integration that would be determined by the initial conditions. Finding their values analytically is not feasible for this equation. The problem asks for an analytical expression with rounding to two decimal places, which applies to the calculable constant part.\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value of the coefficient:\n$3\\sqrt{10/9} \\approx 3 \\times 1.03555... \\approx 3.10665...$\nRounding to two decimal places, the coefficient is $3.11$.\n\nThus, the approximate analytical expression for the solution in the large $x$ regime (approaching the singularity at $x_0$) is:\n\n$y(x) \\approx C - 3.11(x_0 - x)^{1/3}$\n\nThis expression describes the behavior of the solution as it approaches a point where its derivative becomes infinite.\n\n<<<$y(x) \\approx C - 3.11(x_0 - x)^{1/3}$>>>"
