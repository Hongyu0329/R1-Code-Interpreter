    "Here is a memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, followed by the calculation of its memory usage.\n\n### C Program\n\nA highly memory-efficient approach avoids storing the entire input string. Instead, it processes the input character by character, counts the occurrences of each number, and then constructs the sorted sum from these counts.\n\nIt's important to note that the problem description provided in the prompt mentions the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, the original \"Xenia and the beginner mathematician\" problem from platforms like Codeforces typically involves only the numbers 1, 2, and 3. This solution adheres to the prompt's specification of including the number 4.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n/**\n * This program rearranges the terms in a given sum (containing only numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4)\n * into non-decreasing order.\n *\n * The method is highly memory-efficient as it does not store the full input string.\n * It reads the input character by character, using a small, fixed-size array to\n * count the frequency of each number. It then reconstructs the sorted sum from these counts.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Stores the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    // Index 0 holds the count for '1', index 1 for '2', and so on.\n    // Memory: 4 * sizeof(int)\n    int counts[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n    // Variable to hold characters read from input.\n    // Type is 'int' to correctly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) marker.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int)\n    int c;\n\n    // Loop counters.\n    // Memory: 2 * sizeof(int)\n    int i, j;\n\n    // Flag to manage the placement of '+' signs between numbers.\n    // It is initialized to 1 (true) to prevent a leading '+'.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int)\n    int is_first_term = 1;\n\n    // Read the input stream one character at a time.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // Increment the count for the corresponding number.\n        // The character '1' (ASCII 49) minus '1' gives index 0.\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the sorted sum by iterating through the counts.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            // If this is not the first number printed, prepend a '+'.\n            if (!is_first_term) {\n                printf(\"+\");\n            }\n            // Print the number itself.\n            printf(\"%d\", i + 1);\n            // Any subsequent number will not be the first.\n            is_first_term = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print a final newline for clean output.\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory usage for the variables in this program is calculated as the sum of the sizes of all declared variables. The calculation assumes a standard system where the size of an `int` is 4 bytes.\n\n*   **`counts[4]`**: An array of 4 integers.\n    *   `4 * sizeof(int)` = 4 * 4 = 16 bytes.\n*   **`c`**: A single integer variable for `getchar()`.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   **`i, j`**: Two integer variables used as loop counters.\n    *   `2 * sizeof(int)` = 2 * 4 = 8 bytes.\n*   **`is_first_term`**: A single integer variable used as a boolean flag.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n\n**Total memory (m)** = 16 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 32 bytes.\n\n<<<32>>>"
