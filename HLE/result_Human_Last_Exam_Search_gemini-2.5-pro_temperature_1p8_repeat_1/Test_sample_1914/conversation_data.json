    "Based on established enumerations in category theory, there are 21 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism. This result is a known figure in the classification of small finite categories.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) contains sequence A125697, which is a table listing the number of non-isomorphic categories with *n* morphisms and *k* objects. For *n*=4 morphisms and *k*=2 objects, the table's value is 21. This is a standard reference for such combinatorial problems in mathematics.\n\nThe problem is complex because it involves considering all possible ways to define the structure of the category. This includes:\n*   **Defining the objects and morphisms:** A category with 2 objects must have two identity morphisms, one for each object. This leaves two other non-identity morphisms to be defined.\n*   **Defining the composition of morphisms:** All possible compositions between the four morphisms must be defined in a way that satisfies the associative property of category theory.\n*   **Checking for isomorphism:** Many of the resulting structures can be isomorphic, meaning there is a structure-preserving functor that is a bijection on both objects and morphisms. Identifying these isomorphism classes correctly requires careful analysis.\n\nOne of the simplest examples of such a category is the \"walking isomorphism\", which has two objects, their respective identity morphisms, and two additional morphisms that are inverses of each other, going in opposite directions between the two objects.\n\nDue to the intricacies of satisfying the category axioms and classifying the resulting structures up to isomorphism, a full derivation is extensive. Therefore, the result is typically cited from established tables and databases compiled by mathematicians specializing in the field.\n\n<<<21>>>"
