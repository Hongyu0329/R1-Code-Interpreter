    "The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, S<sub>25</sub>, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the number 25. The dimension of each irrep can be calculated using the hook length formula applied to the Young diagram of the corresponding partition. To find the number of irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we must identify all partitions of 25 that satisfy this condition.\n\nThe dimensions of the irreps tend to be smaller for partitions that are \"less balanced,\" such as those with a very large first part. By systematically examining partitions and calculating the dimensions of their corresponding irreps, we can identify those that meet the criteria.\n\nThe following 54 partitions of 25 correspond to irreducible representations with dimensions strictly less than 500,000:\n\n*   **Partitions with dimension 1:** (25) and (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) or (1<sup>25</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 24:** (24,1) and its conjugate (2,1<sup>23</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 275:** (23,2) and its conjugate (2<sup>2</sup>,1<sup>21</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 276:** (23,1,1) and its conjugate (3,1<sup>22</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 2,000:** (22,3) and its conjugate (2<sup>3</sup>,1<sup>19</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 2,024:** (22,1,1,1) and its conjugate (4,1<sup>21</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 3,276:** (22,2,1) and its conjugate (3,2,1<sup>20</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 10,350:** (21,4) and its conjugate (2<sup>4</sup>,1<sup>17</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 10,626:** (21,1,1,1,1) or (21,1<sup>4</sup>) and its conjugate (5,1<sup>20</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 15,125:** (21,2,2) and its conjugate (3,3,1<sup>19</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 25,025:** (21,3,1) and its conjugate (3,2<sup>2</sup>,1<sup>18</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 27,132:** (21,2,1,1) and its conjugate (4,2,1<sup>18</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 40,480:** (20,5) and its conjugate (2<sup>5</sup>,1<sup>15</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 42,504:** (20,1<sup>5</sup>) and its conjugate (6,1<sup>19</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 111,930:** (20,3,2) and its conjugate (3<sup>2</sup>,2,1<sup>17</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 117,348:** (20,4,1) and its conjugate (3,2<sup>3</sup>,1<sup>16</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 123,552:** (20,2,2,1) and its conjugate (4,2<sup>2</sup>,1<sup>16</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 123,970:** (19,6) and its conjugate (2<sup>6</sup>,1<sup>13</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 134,596:** (19,1<sup>6</sup>) and its conjugate (7,1<sup>18</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 136,824:** (20,2,1,1,1) and its conjugate (5,2,1<sup>17</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 169,050:** (20,3,1,1) and its conjugate (4,3,1<sup>17</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 246,246:** (19,3,3) and its conjugate (3<sup>3</sup>,1<sup>16</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 303,600:** (18,7) and its conjugate (2<sup>7</sup>,1<sup>11</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 346,104:** (18,1<sup>7</sup>) and its conjugate (8,1<sup>17</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 400,950:** (19,4,2) and its conjugate (3<sup>2</sup>,2<sup>2</sup>,1<sup>15</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 404,040:** (19,5,1) and its conjugate (3,2<sup>4</sup>,1<sup>14</sup>).\n*   **Partitions with dimension 432,432:** (19,2,2,2) and its conjugate (4<sup>2</sup>,1<sup>17</sup>).\n\nPartitions where the first part is 17 or less result in dimensions exceeding 500,000. For instance, the dimension for the partition (17,8) is 600,875. In total, there are 54 such irreducible representations.\n\n<<<54>>>"
