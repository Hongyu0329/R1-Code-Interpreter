    "Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002. This holds true for the present day as well. Radon is a radioactive gas with a short half-life, meaning it decays quickly after being formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. In 2002, the synthetic noble gas oganesson was first created, but as a synthetic element, it does not naturally occur in terrestrial matter.\n\nThe total mass of the Earth is approximately 5.9722 x 10^24 kilograms. The entire amount of radon in the Earth's atmosphere at any given time is estimated to be only a few tens of grams. While there is also radon in the ground, it is continuously decaying. It is estimated that about 15.3 kilograms of radon are released from the soil globally each year.\n\nGiven the vast mass of the Earth, the percentage of radon is exceedingly small. Taking an estimate of even a generous total global inventory of radon (for example, several hundred kilograms to account for what is in the crust, groundwater, and atmosphere at any moment) results in a percentage that is effectively zero when compared to all terrestrial matter.\n\nOf the naturally occurring noble gases, xenon is the rarest stable one, with an atmospheric abundance of about 0.086 parts per million. However, the radioactive and short-lived nature of radon makes it significantly rarer than xenon.\n\nCalculating with an estimated atmospheric mass of radon of a few tens of grams demonstrates its extreme rarity. For instance, an estimate of 50 grams (0.05 kg) of radon in the atmosphere would represent approximately 8.37 x 10^-25 percent of the Earth's total mass. Even if the total amount on Earth is significantly more than just what's in the atmosphere, radon remains by far the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
