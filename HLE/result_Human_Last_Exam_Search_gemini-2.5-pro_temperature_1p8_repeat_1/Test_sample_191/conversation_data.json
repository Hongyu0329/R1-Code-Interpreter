    "A specific protein that, when broken down, signals for macrophage engulfment is **calreticulin (CALR)**.\n\nNormally, calreticulin is a protein that resides within the endoplasmic reticulum. However, macrophages can secrete calreticulin. Upon secretion, it undergoes cleavage at its C-terminal end. This resulting truncated, or broken down, form of calreticulin then functions as an \"eat-me\" signal. This signal directs macrophages to recognize and engulf target cells, a process known as phagocytosis.\n\nWhile not directly related to the breakdown of a protein *to signal* engulfment, it is important to note the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The breakdown of APP by enzymes called secretases is what produces the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides that accumulate and form plaques in conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, macrophages (and other cells like microglia in the brain) are involved in clearing these amyloid-beta deposits. Several other proteins are involved in the recognition and degradation of amyloid by macrophages, including:\n\n*   **Apolipoprotein E (apoE)** and **matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)**, which play a role in the degradation and clearance of amyloid-beta by macrophages.\n*   Receptor proteins on the macrophage surface, such as **scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI)**, **CD36**, **α6β1 integrin**, and **CD47**, which are involved in binding to and initiating the engulfment of amyloid-beta.\n*   Intracellular proteins like **SHARPIN** and **glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG)**, which regulate the process of phagocytosis within the macrophage.\n\nHowever, the direct answer to the question of a protein whose breakdown product allows for engulfment is calreticulin.\n\n<<<calreticulin>>>"
