    "There is one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor subunit is encoded by the GABRR1 gene and its protein sequence can be found in the UniProt database under the accession number P24046. The protein consists of a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM4), and a significant intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4.\n\nThe transmembrane domains are located at the following residue positions:\n*   TM1: 280-302\n*   TM2: 309-331\n*   TM3: 346-368\n*   TM4: 458-477\n\nThe linker region between TM3 and TM4 therefore spans from amino acid residue 369 to 457. The sequence for this linker is:\n\n`TTVQERKEQKLREKLPCTSGLPPPRTAMLDGNYSDGEVNDLDNYMPENGEKPDRMMVQLTLASERSSPQRKSQRSSYVSMRIDTHAIDKYSRIIFPAAYILFNLIY`\n\nBy examining this sequence, a single Cysteine (C) residue is present at position 384.\n\n<<<1>>>"
