    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Reaction Analysis:\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, has the structure `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent:** The ylide is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. The systematic name indicates it is a phosphonium ylide, derived from (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl)triphenylphosphonium salt. Deprotonation of the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom yields the ylide: `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`. The name ethylidenetriphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane corresponds to Ph₃P=CHCH₃, confirming the naming convention for the core structure.\n\n2.  **The Wittig Reaction:**\n    The Wittig reaction involves the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphonium ylide to form an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph₃P=O`). The carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde is replaced by the carbon group of the ylide.\n\n    *   `(CH₃)₃C-CHO` + `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)` → `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)` + `Ph₃P=O`\n\n3.  **Product Identification:**\n    The resulting alkene has the following structure:\n    ```\n         CH₃\n         |\n    (o-ClC₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=CH-C-CH₃\n                         |\n                         CH₃\n    ```\n    The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry:**\n    The stereochemistry of the resulting double bond (E/Z isomerism) depends on the nature of the ylide.\n    *   **Ylide Classification:** The ylide `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-Ar` is considered a non-stabilized or semi-stabilized ylide because the negative charge on the ylidic carbon is not in direct conjugation with a strongly electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   **Selectivity:** Non-stabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the (Z)-alkene. However, the use of a sterically hindered aldehyde, such as pivalaldehyde, often leads to the predominant formation of the more thermodynamically stable (E)-alkene, where the bulky groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Some studies show that semi-stabilized ylides can also favor the E-isomer. The significant steric bulk of the *tert*-butyl group from pivalaldehyde directs the reaction to form the sterically less hindered (E)-isomer as the major product.\n\nTherefore, the major product of the reaction is the E-isomer.\n\n<<<**(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
