I am unable to provide a definitive answer to your question as it involves non-standard mathematical terminology and concepts that appear to be part of specialized research rather than established knowledge. A complete and accurate response would require a formal definition of "Mercer matrix" and "Popov normal form for an integer matrix," as well as significant mathematical investigation beyond the scope of this tool.
