    "In an infamous 2000 commercial for the energy-trading company Enron, physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman were the two Nobel laureates featured as part of the \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign.\n\nGell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, appeared in a television spot for the campaign. Descriptions of the commercial explicitly mention his participation.\n\nPaul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, served on an advisory board for Enron in 1999. For his role, he received a payment of $37,500. In the same year, he authored a favorable article about Enron in *Fortune* magazine. Although his direct appearance in a commercial is less documented in the provided results, his paid advisory role and public comments connect him to Enron's promotional efforts during that period.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was designed to portray Enron as an innovative and forward-thinking company. However, it later became a symbol of the company's massive corporate fraud and subsequent collapse in 2001.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
