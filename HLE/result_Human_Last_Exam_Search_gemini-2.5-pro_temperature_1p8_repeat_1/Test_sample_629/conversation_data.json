    "Of the 10 minimal grid diagrams for the trefoil knot, 4 represent the left-handed version up to translation and rotation. The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot is 5. This means the smallest possible grid to draw the knot on is 5x5.\n\nResearch has shown there are a total of 10 distinct trefoil knot diagrams with this minimal 5x5 grid size. These 10 diagrams account for both the left-handed and right-handed versions of the trefoil, which are mirror images of each other and are not topologically equivalent.\n\nA detailed classification of these minimal grid diagrams reveals that 6 of them correspond to the right-handed trefoil knot. Consequently, the remaining 4 diagrams represent the left-handed trefoil knot. These diagrams are considered distinct up to the equivalences of translation and rotation on the grid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
