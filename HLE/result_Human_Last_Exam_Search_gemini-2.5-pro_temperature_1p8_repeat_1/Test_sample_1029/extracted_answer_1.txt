The Poynting vector inside the cylindrical rod is given by:
$$ \vec{S} = -\frac{E \rho v r}{2} \hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v r^2}{4 \epsilon_0} \hat{z} $$
where $\hat{r}$ is the radial unit vector pointing away from the axis, and $\hat{z}$ is the unit vector along the axis of the cylinder in the direction of motion.
