    "To find the first three digits after the comma of `tan(10^100)`, we need to perform a high-precision calculation. The core of this problem lies in the periodicity of the tangent function. The period of `tan(x)` is `π`, which means `tan(x) = tan(x + kπ)` for any integer `k`. Therefore, to calculate `tan(10^100)`, we must find the remainder of `10^100` when divided by `π`.\n\nThis is a numerical challenge that requires a very precise value of `π` or `1/π`. Specifically, to find the remainder of `10^100` divided by `π`, we need to determine `10^100 - k * π`, where `k` is the integer `floor(10^100 / π)`. The calculation of `k` demands a value of `π` accurate to more than 100 decimal places.\n\nThis type of calculation is well beyond the capacity of standard calculators, which typically handle about 15-20 digits of precision. Using a standard calculator or programming language with double-precision floating-point numbers would lead to incorrect results due to insufficient precision. For instance, different software might give varying results like -0.5946 or 0.4012, highlighting the problem of precision.\n\nTo solve this, one would typically use a computational algebra system or a specialized high-precision arithmetic library. These tools can handle calculations with hundreds or thousands of digits. The problem is equivalent to finding the fractional part of `10^100 / π`. It has been noted that the digits needed are related to the 101st and 102nd digits after the decimal point of `1/π`.\n\nBy using a high-precision calculator, the value of `tan(10^100)` is found to be approximately -0.411623.\n\nThe first three digits after the comma are therefore 411.\n\n<<<411>>>"
