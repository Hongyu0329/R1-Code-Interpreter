    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA \"continuum\" in topology is a compact and connected metric space. A \"planar continuum\" is one that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane. A continuum is \"homogeneous\" if, for any two points in the continuum, there is a homeomorphism of the continuum onto itself that maps one point to the other. A \"homeomorphism class\" is a collection of topological spaces that are all equivalent up to homeomorphism (i.e., can be continuously deformed into one another).\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua distinguishes between degenerate and non-degenerate cases:\n\n*   **Degenerate Case:** A single point is a homogeneous planar continuum. This constitutes one homeomorphism class.\n\n*   **Non-degenerate Cases:** For continua with more than one point, a complete classification was finalized in 2014 by Hoehn and Oversteegen. They showed that every non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of the following three spaces:\n    *   **The simple closed curve (or circle):** This is the familiar one-dimensional circle.\n    *   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a one-dimensional, arc-like but indecomposable continuum. It is path-connected but contains no arcs.\n    *   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This is a decomposable continuum where each \"point\" in a circle is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n\nTherefore, combining the single degenerate case with the three non-degenerate cases, there are a total of four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
