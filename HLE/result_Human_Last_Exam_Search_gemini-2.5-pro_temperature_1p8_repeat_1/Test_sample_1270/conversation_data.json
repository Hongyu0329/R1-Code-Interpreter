    "\"Mercedesbenzene\" is a fictitious molecule and a form of organic chemistry humor. The name and common depictions of its structure are a visual pun based on the Mercedes-Benz logo.\n\nThe structure consists of a central benzene ring, which is an aromatic hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C₆H₆, meaning it contains six carbon atoms. Attached to this ring are three additional groups arranged to mimic the three-pointed star of the car manufacturer's logo. In the most common and simplest chemical interpretation of this joke, these three attached groups are methyl groups (-CH₃).\n\nTherefore, the fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is understood to be 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. This molecule has:\n*   6 carbon atoms in the benzene ring\n*   3 carbon atoms from the three methyl groups\n\nThis results in a total of 9 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<9>>>"
