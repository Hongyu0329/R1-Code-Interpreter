    "The searches confirm the fundamental formulas for the particle in a 1D box model. The wavefunction is given by ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a), and the probability of finding the particle in a given interval is the integral of the squared wavefunction over that interval. For the n=2 state, there is a node at the center of the box (x=a/2), meaning the probability of finding the particle at that exact point is zero.\n\nThe provided problem asks for the probability in a very small interval (from 0.495a to 0.505a) centered on this node. Because the probability density is not constant over this interval, a simple multiplication of probability density at the center (which is zero) by the interval width is not sufficient. A direct integration is necessary.\n\nThe calculation performed in the thought process, which uses a Taylor expansion approximation for the integrand, is a valid approach for such a problem and is less prone to the numerical precision issues that arose from the direct evaluation of the trigonometric functions. Both the approximation method and the Taylor expansion of the exact integral yielded the same result. The final calculation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Probability Formula:** `P = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`.\n2.  **Approximation around the node:** Let `y = x - 0.5a`. The function to integrate becomes `(2/a) * sin²(2πy/a)`. For a small interval, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. So the integrand is approximately `(2/a) * (2πy/a)² = 8π²y²/a³`.\n3.  **Integration:** The integral `∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (8π²y²/a³) dy` is evaluated.\n4.  **Result:** The integration yields `P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³`.\n\nThis provides the most reliable result.\n\n`P ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (0.005)³`\n`P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n`P ≈ 52.638 * 1.25 x 10⁻⁷`\n`P ≈ 6.57975 x 10⁻⁶`\n\n<<<The probability that the particle in the 1D box is located in an interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶ or 0.000658%.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe probability `P` of finding the particle in the interval `[x₁, x₂]` is given by the integral of the probability density, `|ψn(x)|²`, over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is:\n`ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n\nFor the `n=2` state, the probability density is:\n`|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)`\n\nThe probability is the integral:\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\nThe interval is very small (`Δx = 0.01a`) and centered at `x = 0.5a`, which is a node for the n=2 state (since `sin(2π(0.5a)/a) = sin(π) = 0`). Because the probability density is zero at the center of the integration interval, we must integrate to find the probability over the small region around the node.\n\nTo solve this, we can use an approximation by expanding the `sin²` function around the node. Let `y = x - 0.5a`. When `x = 0.495a`, `y = -0.005a`, and when `x = 0.505a`, `y = 0.005a`.\n\nThe argument of the sine function becomes `2πx/a = 2π(y + 0.5a)/a = 2πy/a + π`.\n`sin²(2πx/a) = sin²(π + 2πy/a) = (-sin(2πy/a))² = sin²(2πy/a)`\n\nFor small `y`, we can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`, where `θ = 2πy/a`.\nSo, `sin²(2πy/a) ≈ (2πy/a)² = 4π²y²/a²`.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n`P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²y²/a²) dy`\n`P ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy`\n\nEvaluating the integral of `y²` gives `[y³/3]`.\n`P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [y³/3]` from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`\n`P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [(0.005a)³/3 - (-0.005a)³/3]`\n`P ≈ (8π²/a³) * 2 * (0.005a)³/3`\n`P ≈ (16π²/(3a³)) * (0.005)³ * a³`\n`P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³`\n`P ≈ (16 * (3.14159)² / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n`P ≈ (52.6378) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n`P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶`\n>>>"
