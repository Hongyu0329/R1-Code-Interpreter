    "There are five wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\nThe symmetry of any repeating two-dimensional pattern can be described by one of the 17 wallpaper groups. Each of these groups is associated with a point group, which describes the symmetries that leave a single point fixed, such as rotations and reflections. The order of a group refers to the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains.\n\nThe possible point groups for any wallpaper group are C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, D1, D2, D3, D4, and D6. The order of a cyclic group, denoted as C_n, is *n*, while the order of a dihedral group, D_n, is 2*n*. Therefore, the point groups with an order of 2 are C2 and D1.\n\nThe wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C2 (also denoted as Z2).\n*   **pm**: This group's point group is D1 (which is isomorphic to Z2).\n*   **pg**: This group also has the point group D1.\n*   **cm**: The point group for this wallpaper group is D1.\n\nIn summary, there are a total of four wallpaper groups associated with a point group of order 2.\n\n"
