To simulate the correlations from a set of POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state with a local hidden variable model, the minimal average resources necessary are:
*   For the case of **projective measurements** (a subset of POVMs), the minimal resource is **one bit of classical communication** on average, which can be compressed to approximately 0.85 bits, or, alternatively, **one use of a non-signaling PR-Box**.
*   For a general set of **POVMs**, more resources are required, with protocols existing that use on average **5.7 bits of communication**. This value can be lower if the set of POVMs is restricted, and can even be zero for certain "noisy" measurements.
