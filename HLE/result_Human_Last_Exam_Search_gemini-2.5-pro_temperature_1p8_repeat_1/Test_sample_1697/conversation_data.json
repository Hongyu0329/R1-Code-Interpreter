    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM), followed by an electrophilic quench. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Reactants:**\n\n*   **Substrate:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   **Reagents (Step 1):** sec-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in Tetrahydrofuran (THF)\n*   **Reagent (Step 2):** Methyl iodide (CH₃I)\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Mechanism**\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**\n\nThe first step involves the deprotonation of an aromatic proton by the strong base, sec-BuLi. The regioselectivity of this deprotonation is controlled by the directing metalation groups (DMGs) present on the benzene ring. The purpose of TMEDA is to chelate the lithium ion, breaking down the butyllithium aggregates and increasing its basicity and reactivity.\n\nThe starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two DMGs:\n1.  **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CON(C₂H₅)₂) at position 1:** This is a very powerful DMG.\n2.  **Dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) at position 3:** This is also a good DMG.\n\nThe directing power of these groups determines which aromatic proton is removed. Competition experiments have established a hierarchy for DMGs, with the tertiary amide group being a significantly stronger director than the tertiary amino group.\n\nWhen two DMGs are in a meta-relationship (at positions 1 and 3), they exert a cooperative effect, strongly favoring the metalation (lithiation) at the position between them, which is C2.\n\n*   The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group directs lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n*   The dimethylamino group directs lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 and C4.\n\nBoth groups direct the lithiation to the C2 position. This cooperative directing effect makes the proton at C2 the most acidic on the ring, leading to its selective removal by sec-BuLi. This forms a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate where the lithium atom is positioned at C2.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with an electrophile, in this case, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion in a standard nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction sequence results in the specific methylation of the benzene ring at the C2 position. Therefore, the final compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nThe final product is:\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
