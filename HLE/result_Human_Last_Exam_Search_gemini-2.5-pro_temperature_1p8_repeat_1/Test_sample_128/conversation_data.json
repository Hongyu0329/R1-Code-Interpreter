    "A unitary quantum gate operation on a single qubit corresponds geometrically to a rotation of the Bloch sphere. A fundamental property of rotations is that they preserve the orientation of the coordinate axes. That is, if the initial axes (x, y, z) form a right-handed system, the transformed axes (x', y', z') must also form a right-handed system. An operation that transforms a right-handed system to a left-handed one is a reflection (an improper rotation), and it cannot be implemented by a unitary gate.\n\nThe six basis states correspond to the positive and negative directions of the three Cartesian axes on the Bloch sphere:\n*   The Z-axis is defined by the basis B_z = {|0⟩, |1⟩}.\n*   The X-axis is defined by the basis B_x = {|+⟩, |-⟩}.\n*   The Y-axis is defined by the basis B_y = {|i⟩, |-i⟩}.\n\nA given transformation U maps these input bases to output bases. We can determine the transformation of the axes by observing where each basis is mapped. For instance, if U maps the states {|0⟩, |1⟩} to states in the X-basis {|+⟩, |-⟩}, then the Z-axis is mapped to the X-axis (z → x).\n\nLet's analyze the transformation described in answer choice **F**:\n\n1.  **Z-axis transformation**:\n    *   ∣0⟩ → ∣+⟩\n    *   ∣1⟩ → ∣-⟩\n    *   The Z-basis {|0⟩, |1⟩} is mapped to the X-basis {|+⟩, |-⟩}. Thus, the Z-axis is mapped to the X-axis (z → x).\n\n2.  **X-axis transformation**:\n    *   ∣+⟩ → ∣1⟩\n    *   ∣-⟩ → ∣0⟩\n    *   The X-basis {|+⟩, |-⟩} is mapped to the Z-basis {|1⟩, |0⟩}. Thus, the X-axis is mapped to the Z-axis (x → z).\n\n3.  **Y-axis transformation**:\n    *   ∣i⟩ → ∣i⟩\n    *   ∣-i⟩ → ∣-i⟩\n    *   The Y-basis {|i⟩, |-i⟩} is mapped to itself. Thus, the Y-axis is mapped to the Y-axis (y → y).\n\nSo, the overall transformation of the coordinate system is (x, y, z) → (z, y, x).\n\nNow, we must check if this transformation preserves the orientation (handedness) of the axes. A standard way to do this is to check the cross product of the new basis vectors. The original system (e_x, e_y, e_z) is right-handed, satisfying e_x × e_y = e_z. The new system (e_x', e_y', e_z') = (e_z, e_y, e_x) must satisfy e_x' × e_y' = e_z' for the transformation to be a rotation.\n\nLet's compute the cross product:\ne_x' × e_y' = e_z × e_y\n\nUsing the properties of the cross product for a right-handed system (e_y × e_z = e_x), we have:\ne_z × e_y = - (e_y × e_z) = -e_x\n\nSo, e_x' × e_y' = -e_x. However, the new z-axis is e_z' = e_x. Since -e_x ≠ e_x, the new system is not right-handed.\n\nAlternatively, one can compute the determinant of the transformation matrix that maps the basis vectors:\ne_x = (1,0,0) → (0,0,1) = e_z\ne_y = (0,1,0) → (0,1,0) = e_y\ne_z = (0,0,1) → (1,0,0) = e_x\n\nThe matrix for this transformation is:\n```\n| 0  0  1 |\n| 0  1  0 |\n| 1  0  0 |\n```\nThe determinant of this matrix is 0(0 - 0) - 0(0 - 0) + 1(0 - 1) = -1.\n\nA determinant of +1 signifies a rotation (a proper rotation), which is a valid unitary operation. A determinant of -1 signifies a reflection (an improper rotation), which cannot be achieved by any unitary quantum gate.\n\nSince the transformation in **F** corresponds to a reflection, it is not a possible unitary quantum gate operation. All other transformations listed can be shown to correspond to rotations (determinant +1) and are therefore possible.\n\n"
