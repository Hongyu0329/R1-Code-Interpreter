    "The riddle is solved by connecting the clues in the haiku to a specific historical event and location, which then allows for an interpretation of the title as a question. The haiku's elements point to the abdication of the last emperor of Vietnam, Bảo Đại.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the clues from the haiku:\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This refers to the August Revolution of 1945 in Vietnam, a period of significant political upheaval that led to the end of the monarchy.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty. On August 30, 1945, Emperor Bảo Đại held a public ceremony to abdicate his throne, a major \"wind of change\" for the nation.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: The emperors of Vietnam were considered to hold the \"Mandate of Heaven,\" a divine right to rule. Bảo Đại's abdication represented this \"divine one\" yielding power.\n\nWith Vietnam identified as the country in question, the title \"The Bays\" becomes a straightforward question: What are the bays of Vietnam? The final part of the user's prompt requires the answer to be in alphabetical order. The answer is a list of some of Vietnam's most famous bays.\n\nThe answer is:\n<<<Bai Tu Long Bay, Cam Ranh Bay, Ha Long Bay, Lan Ha Bay, Lang Co Bay, Nha Trang Bay, Van Phong Bay, Vinh Hy Bay>>>"
