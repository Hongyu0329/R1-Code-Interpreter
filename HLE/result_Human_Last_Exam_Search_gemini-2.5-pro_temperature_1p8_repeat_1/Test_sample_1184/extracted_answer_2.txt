The key hotspot residues for the interaction of the human beta-1 subunit with the alpha-1 subunit are primarily located in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain and form the Alpha Binding Pocket (ABP). Based on homology with other beta subunits and structural studies, these include Leucine (L356), Valine (V360), Tryptophan (W364), Leucine (L390), Isoleucine (I394), Methionine (M451), Tyrosine (Y453), and Isoleucine (I478).

The residues responsible for fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit are more broadly distributed. The GK domain is a major modulator, with surface-exposed charged residues such as Aspartate (D423), Aspartate (D424), and Glutamate (E427) playing a role in channel activation. Additionally, the N-terminus of the beta-1 subunit is important for modulating inactivation kinetics, and post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, for instance at Serine (S547), can also influence gating.
