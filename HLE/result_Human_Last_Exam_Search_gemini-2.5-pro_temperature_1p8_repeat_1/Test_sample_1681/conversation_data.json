    "In the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the classical outcome of mutual defection is no longer the only possibility. By utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically entanglement, new strategic options arise that can lead to a more favorable and stable equilibrium.\n\nThe setup for a quantum game, as described by the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme, involves an arbiter preparing an initial entangled state shared between the two players. The players do not just choose to \"Cooperate\" (C) or \"Defect\" (D); instead, they apply quantum strategies, which are unitary operations on their part of the entangled state (their qubit).\n\nFor an optimal outcome, the initial state is designed to be maximally or near-maximally entangled. With a sufficient degree of entanglement, a new Nash Equilibrium emerges that resolves the dilemma. A Nash Equilibrium is a state where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nThe key findings are:\n*   **New Quantum Strategy:** A new strategy, often called the \"Quantum\" or \"Q\" strategy, becomes available to both players.\n*   **Pareto Optimal Equilibrium:** When both players select this new quantum strategy (Q), they can achieve a payoff that corresponds to the classical mutual cooperation outcome. For the given payoff matrix, this is (5, 5). This (Q, Q) strategy profile becomes a Nash Equilibrium.\n*   **Dilemma Resolution:** Crucially, if one player chooses Q, the other player's best response is also Q. Unlike the classical game, there is no incentive to unilaterally defect, because the entanglement ensures that defecting from a mutual quantum strategy would result in a lower payoff. This makes the cooperative outcome stable.\n*   **Persistence of Old Equilibrium:** It is important to note that the classical equilibrium of (Defect, Defect), with its payoff of (1, 1), often still exists as another Nash Equilibrium in the quantum version.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the equilibrium point in a context where the initial state is designed for an optimal result, the focus is on the new, superior equilibrium that quantum mechanics makes possible. This equilibrium point resolves the prisoner's dilemma by making cooperation a rational and stable strategy.\n\n<<< (5, 5) >>>"
