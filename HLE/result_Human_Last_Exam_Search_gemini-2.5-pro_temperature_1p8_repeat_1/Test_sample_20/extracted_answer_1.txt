Yes, it is true. The Wasserstein regular subgradient of the functional $J(\mu) = \frac{1}{2}W(\mu,\nu)^2$ at its minimum is the trivial tangent vector. The minimum is uniquely attained at $\mu=\nu$. At this point, the optimal transport map from $\mu$ to $\nu$ is the identity map. This ensures the differentiability of the functional, and its gradient, which coincides with the regular subgradient, is the zero vector field, representing the trivial tangent vector.
