    "This is a puzzle that requires identifying a transformation rule from the given input-output pairs and then applying that rule to a new input. Let's break down the logic step by step.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nFirst, we analyze the changes between the input and output strings for the provided examples. The strings can be interpreted as rows in a 2D grid.\n\n**Example A:**\n\n*   **Input_A:** `'001111,121111,111111'`\n*   **Output_A:** `'201111,101111,111111'`\n\nLet's represent them as grids:\n\nInput Grid A:\n```\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\nOutput Grid A:\n```\n2 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nBy comparing the grids, we can see two changes:\n1.  The character '2' at position `(row=1, column=1)` in the input becomes '0' in the output.\n2.  The character '0' at position `(row=0, column=0)` in the input becomes '2' in the output.\n\nIt appears to be a swap of values between the cell containing '2' and another cell containing '0'.\n\n**Example B:**\n\n*   **Input_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n*   **Output_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n\nLet's identify the changes:\n1.  In the fourth line (`row=3`), the input is `1111002111111` and the output is `1111000111111`. The '2' at `(row=3, column=6)` becomes a '0'.\n2.  In the third line (`row=2`), the input is `1111000011110` and the output is `1111000211110`. The '0' at `(row=2, column=7)` becomes a '2'.\n\nThis confirms the rule: **A '2' at position `(r, c)` and a '0' at another position `(r', c')` swap their values.**\n\n### Finding the Location of the '0'\n\nThe next step is to determine the rule that links the position of the '2', `(r, c)`, to the position of the '0', `(r', c')`.\n\n*   In Example A: The '2' is at `(1, 1)` and the '0' is at `(0, 0)`. The relationship is `r' = r - 1` and `c' = c - 1`.\n*   In Example B: The '2' is at `(3, 6)` and the '0' is at `(2, 7)`. The relationship is `r' = r - 1` and `c' = c + 1`.\n\nThe row of the '0' is consistently one row above the '2' (`r' = r - 1`). The column `c'` changes based on some condition: sometimes it's `c - 1` and sometimes `c + 1`. We need to find the condition. Let's consider a few hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Coordinate Sum Parity:** The choice depends on the parity of the sum of the coordinates of the '2'.\n    *   A: `(1, 1)`. `1 + 1 = 2` (even). Action is `c' = c - 1`.\n    *   B: `(3, 6)`. `3 + 6 = 9` (odd). Action is `c' = c + 1`.\n    *   This rule is consistent: if `r+c` is even, `c'` is `c-1`; if odd, `c'` is `c+1`.\n\n2.  **Neighbor Value:** The choice depends on the values of the neighbors of the '2'. Let's check the parity of the sum of the horizontal neighbors.\n    *   A: The line is `...121...`. Neighbors are '1' and '1'. Sum = `1+1=2` (even). Action is `c' = c - 1`.\n    *   B: The line is `...021...`. Neighbors are '0' and '1'. Sum = `0+1=1` (odd). Action is `c' = c + 1`.\n    *   This rule is also consistent: if the sum of horizontal neighbors is even, `c'` is `c-1`; if odd, `c'` is `c+1`.\n\nBoth hypotheses work for examples A and B. Let's apply them to Input_C to find the value of MISSING.\n\n### Solving for MISSING\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n\nGrid C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 2 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThe '2' is located at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`. The transformed '0' will be in the row above (`r' = 1 - 1 = 0`). We need to find the column `c'`.\n\nLet's test our hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Coordinate Sum Parity:**\n    *   `r + c = 1 + 4 = 5` (odd).\n    *   According to the rule, `odd` implies `c' = c + 1`.\n    *   `c' = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   The '0' to be swapped is at `(0, 5)`.\n\n2.  **Neighbor Value Parity:**\n    *   The line containing the '2' is `011120`.\n    *   The horizontal neighbors are '1' (at column 3) and '0' (at column 5).\n    *   The sum is `1 + 0 = 1` (odd).\n    *   According to the rule, `odd` implies `c' = c + 1`.\n    *   `c' = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   The '0' to be swapped is at `(0, 5)`.\n\nBoth hypotheses point to the same '0' at position `(0, 5)`. This gives us a high degree of confidence in the result.\n\nNow we perform the swap:\n*   The '2' at `(1, 4)` becomes '0'. The second line `011120` becomes `011100`.\n*   The '0' at `(0, 5)` becomes '2'. The first line `000000` becomes `000002`.\n*   The third line `111111` remains unchanged.\n\nCombining the new lines gives the final output.\n\n**MISSING = '000002,011100,111111'**\n\n"
