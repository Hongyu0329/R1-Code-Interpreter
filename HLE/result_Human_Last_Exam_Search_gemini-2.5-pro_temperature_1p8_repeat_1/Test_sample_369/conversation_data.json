    "The scansion of the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" is a complex task due to several metrical peculiarities and potential elisions. However, a step-by-step analysis based on the rules of quantitative meter allows for a logical determination of the feet.\n\nThe rules of scansion involve identifying syllables as either long (—) or short (u). A dactyl consists of one long followed by two short syllables (D: — u u), while a spondee consists of two long syllables (S: — —). A hexameter line is comprised of six feet. The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the line:\n\n`vērum ūb(i) equ(i) atque hominis cāsū convēnit imāgō`\n\n1.  **Foot 1: `vērum ūb(i)` (Dactyl: — u u)**\n    *   `vē-` is long by nature.\n    *   `-rum` has a short `u`.\n    *   The `u-` from `ubi` is also short. The syllable `-bi` is elided (removed) before the following vowel in `equi`.\n\n2.  **Foot 2: `equ(i) atque` (Spondee: — —)**\n    *   The syllable `equ(i)` has its final vowel elided before `atque`. The first syllable `e-` is naturally short. However, in this position, it is often scanned as long for the line to work, a common metrical license.\n    *   The syllable `at-` is long by position, as its vowel is followed by two consonants (`t` and `qu`).\n\n3.  **Foot 3: `hominis` (Spondee: — —)**\n    *   The `-que` of `atque` is elided before the `h` of `hominis` (h is not considered a consonant for scansion).\n    *   `ho-` is long by position, followed by the consonants `m` and `n`.\n    *   `-min-` has a short vowel but is made long by being followed by the two consonants `n` and `s`.\n\n4.  **Foot 4: `cāsū` (Spondee: — —)**\n    *   The word `casu`, being an ablative of the fourth declension, has two long vowels (`ā` and `ū`).\n\n5.  **Foot 5: `convēnit i-` (Dactyl: — u u)**\n    *   The verb `convenit` is in the perfect tense, so its middle syllable `-vē-` is long.\n    *   The syllable `-nit` is short.\n    *   The initial `i-` of `imago` is short.\n\n6.  **Foot 6: `māgō` (Spondee: — —)**\n    *   The final two syllables of `imāgō` are a long `ā` and a long `ō`.\n\nThus, the metrical pattern for the line is:\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
