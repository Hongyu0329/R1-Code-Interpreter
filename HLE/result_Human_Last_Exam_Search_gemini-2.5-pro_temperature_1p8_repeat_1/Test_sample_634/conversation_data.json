    "I have found that the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, is a polynomial matrix D such that P1 = Q1*D and P2 = Q2*D for some polynomial matrices Q1 and Q2. Furthermore, any other common right divisor must be a right divisor of D.\n\nA common method to find the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves forming a compound matrix and bringing it to a specific form using row operations. Another approach involves forming a generalized Sylvester matrix.\n\nFor the given matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s-1, 1]\n\nI will use a method based on the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the GCRD as D(s). We are looking for a D(s) such that:\nP1(s) = Q1(s) * D(s)\nP2(s) = Q2(s) * D(s)\n\nOne way to do this is to perform right elementary operations on the matrices. However, a more systematic way is to use the extended Euclidean algorithm idea. We can try to find a polynomial matrix U(s) such that P1(s) - U(s)P2(s) has a simpler form.\n\nLet's try to left-multiply P2 by a matrix to \"reduce\" P1.\nLet's choose U(s) = [[s, 0], [0, s]]\nU(s)P2(s) = [[s^2, 0], [-s^2 - s, s]]\n\nNow let's compute R(s) = P1(s) - U(s)P2(s)\nR(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] - [[s^2, 0], [-s^2 - s, s]]\n= [[s, -s], [s - 1, s^2 - s]]\n\nThis doesn't seem to simplify things directly.\n\nLet's try a different approach. A common right divisor of P1 and P2 is also a right divisor of P1 + U*P2 for any conformable polynomial matrix U.\n\nAnother method is to form the matrix M = [P1^T, P2^T]^T and reduce it to a row-echelon form. The non-zero rows will then form the GCRD. Let's form the matrix:\nM = [ [s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1],\n      [-s, s^2],\n      [s, -s - 1],\n      ]\n\nThis is the transpose of what we should be using. We should stack them vertically:\nM = [ P1 ]\n    [ P2 ]\nM = [ [s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\nNow, we perform row operations to simplify this matrix. The goal is to obtain a matrix of the form [G(s) ; 0], where G(s) is the GCRD.\n\n1.  R2 <- R2 + R1\n    [ [s^2 + s, -s],\n      [s - 1, s^2 - s],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n2.  R1 <- R1 - (s+1) * R3\n    [ [0, -s],\n      [s - 1, s^2 - s],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n3.  R1 <-> R3\n    [ [s, 0],\n      [s - 1, s^2 - s],\n      [0, -s],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n4.  R2 <- R2 - (1 - 1/s) * R1. This involves fractions which we want to avoid. Let's stick to polynomial operations.\n\nLet's try to eliminate the highest powers of s.\n\nM = [ [s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n1.  R1 <- R1 - s*R3\n    [ [s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n2.  R2 <- R2 + s*R3 + R3\n    R2 <- R2 + (s+1)R3\n    [ [s, -s],\n      [-1, s^2],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\nThis is not going in the right direction. Let's restart with a more structured approach. A key property is that if we have P1 = Q1*D and P2 = Q2*D, then by performing column operations on D, say D' = D*U where U is unimodular, then D' is also a GCRD.\n\nLet's check if P2 is a right divisor of P1. For this to be true, P1 * inv(P2) must be a polynomial matrix.\ndet(P2) = s*1 - 0*(-s-1) = s\ninv(P2) = (1/s) * [, [s+1, s]] = [[1/s, 0], [1+1/s, 1]]\n\nP1 * inv(P2) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] * [[1/s, 0], [(s+1)/s, 1]]\n= [[ (s^2+s)/s - s(s+1)/s , -s],\n   [(-s^2-1)/s + s^2(s+1)/s, s^2]]\n= [[ s+1 - (s+1), -s],\n   [(-s^2-1)/s + s(s+1), s^2]]\n= [[0, -s],\n   [(-s^2-1)/s + s^2+s, s^2]]\nThe term (-s^2-1)/s is not a polynomial. So P2 is not a right divisor of P1.\n\nLet's try to find a simpler common right divisor. Consider a generic first-degree polynomial matrix D(s) = [[as+b, cs+d], [es+f, gs+h]]. The calculations will be very tedious.\n\nLet's reconsider the row reduction of the augmented matrix M.\nM = [ [s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\nLet's use the fourth row to simplify the others.\n1.  R1 <- R1 + s*R4\n    [ [s, 0],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n2.  R2 <- R2 - s^2*R4\n    [ [s, 0],\n      [-s^2 - 1 + s^2(s+1), 0],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n    = [ [s, 0],\n        [s^3, 0],\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n3. R2 <- R2 - s^2*R1 and R3 <- R3 - R1\n    [ [s, 0],\n     ,\n     ,\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n4.  Now we have the matrix:\n    [ [s, 0],\n     ,\n     ,\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n    We can discard the zero rows.\n    [ [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\nThis resulting matrix is P2. The procedure seems to indicate that P2 is the GCRD. But we have already shown that P2 does not right divide P1. What went wrong? The operations on the rows of the stacked matrix [P1; P2] must correspond to left multiplication by unimodular matrices. The operations I performed were of the form Ri <- Ri + q(s)*Rj, which are valid.\n\nLet's re-verify my check that P2 doesn't divide P1.\nP1 * inv(P2) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] * (1/s) * [, [s+1, s]]\n= (1/s) * [[s^2+s -s(s+1), -s^2], [-s^2-1 + s^2(s+1), s^3]]\n= (1/s) * [[0, -s^2], [-s^2-1 + s^3+s^2, s^3]]\n= (1/s) * [[0, -s^2], [s^3-1, s^3]]\n= [[0, -s], [s^2 - 1/s, s^2]]\nThe term s^2 - 1/s is indeed not a polynomial. My initial check was correct.\n\nSo, where is the mistake in the row reduction?\nLet M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]. A GCRD G(s) of P1 and P2 has the property that the row space of M(s) over the ring of rational functions is the same as the row space of G(s) over the ring of rational functions. The algorithm to find the GCRD involves finding a basis for the module generated by the rows of P1 and P2.\n\nLet's retry the row operations more carefully.\nM = [ [s^2 + s, -s],   (R1)\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2], (R2)\n      [s, 0],         (R3)\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]    (R4)\n\nR1' = R1 + s*R4 -> [s^2+s -s(s+1), -s+s] =.  This seems too simple, let me re-calculate.\nR1 = [s^2+s, -s]\ns*R4 = [-s^2-s, s]\nR1 + s*R4 = [s^2+s -s^2-s, -s+s] =. This is correct.\n\nR2' = R2 + s^2*R4 -> [-s^2-1 + s^2(-s-1), s^2+s^2] ... wait, this is wrong.\nR2 + s^2*R4 = [-s^2 -1 -s^3-s^2, s^2+s^2] is also wrong, R4 has a 1.\ns^2*R4 = [-s^2(s+1), s^2] = [-s^3-s^2, s^2].\nR2' = R2 + s^2*R4 = [-s^2-1-s^3-s^2, s^2+s^2] = [-s^3-2s^2-1, 2s^2]. That's not simplifying.\n\nLet's use R3.\nR1' = R1 - (s+1)R3 = [s^2+s - s(s+1), -s - 0] = [0, -s]. Correct.\nR2' = R2 + sR3 = [-s^2-1+s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]. Correct.\nSo the matrix is now:\n[ [0, -s],\n  [-1, s^2],\n  [s, 0],\n  [-s-1, 1] ]\n\nNow what? We can't use the first two rows to eliminate terms in the last two without introducing fractions. Let's use the last row.\nR1 remains [0, -s]\nR2' = R2 + s^2*R4 -> [-1 -s^2(s+1), s^2+s^2] = [-1-s^3-s^2, 2s^2]. Getting complicated.\n\nLet's look for a very simple GCRD.\nWhat about D = [s, -1]? This is 1x2. A GCRD can be rectangular.\nLet's see if D divides P2 = [s, 0; -s-1, 1].\nThis would mean P2 = Q * D = [q1; q2] * [s, -1] = [ [q1*s, -q1], [q2*s, -q2] ].\nComparing with P2, we'd need:\nq1*s = s -> q1=1\n-q1 = 0 -> q1=0. Contradiction. So [s, -1] is not a GCRD.\n\nWhat about D = [1, s]?\nP2 = [q1;q2] * [1, s] = [ [q1, q1*s], [q2, q2*s] ]\nComparing with P2,\nq1=s\nq1*s = 0 => s*s = 0, false.\n\nLet's try D = [s-1, 1]?\nLet's consider the determinants of the minors.\nFor P1, the 2x2 determinant is (s^2+s)s^2 - (-s)(-s^2-1) = s^4+s^3 - s^3-s = s^4-s = s(s-1)(s^2+s+1).\nFor P2, the determinant is s.\nThe GCD of the determinants is s. This suggests that the determinant of the GCRD might be a divisor of s.\n\nLet D be the GCRD. P1 = Q1*D and P2 = Q2*D. So det(P1) = det(Q1)*det(D) and det(P2) = det(Q2)*det(D).\nThus det(D) must be a common divisor of det(P1) and det(P2).\nGCD(s^4-s, s) = s. So det(D) must be a divisor of s. This means det(D) can be 1, s, or a constant.\nIf det(D) is a non-zero constant, D is unimodular, meaning P1 and P2 are right coprime.\nIf det(D)=s, then D could be P2 itself, but we've ruled that out.\n\nIs it possible the GCRD is unimodular? Two polynomial matrices are right coprime if their stacked matrix [P1; P2] has a left inverse that is a polynomial matrix. Or, equivalently, if the Smith form of the stacked matrix is [I; 0].\n\nLet's test for right coprimeness. P1 and P2 are right coprime if and only if there exist polynomial matrices X(s) and Y(s) such that X(s)P1(s) + Y(s)P2(s) = I (the identity matrix).\n\nThis is the Bezout identity. Let's try to construct such X and Y.\nLet's go back to the row-reduced matrix M:\nM' =\n[ [s, 0],\n ,\n ,\n  [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\nThis came from my first, likely flawed, row reduction. Let's be extremely careful this time.\nM = [R1; R2; R3; R4] = [ [s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1] ]\nLet's use row R4 to eliminate entries in the second column.\nR1_new = R1 + s*R4 = [s^2+s + s(-s-1), -s + s*1] = [s^2+s-s^2-s, 0] =.\nR2_new = R2 - s^2*R4 = [-s^2-1 -s^2(-s-1), s^2 -s^2*1] = [-s^2-1+s^3+s^2, 0] = [s^3-1, 0].\nR3 is unchanged: [s, 0].\nThe matrix becomes:\n[,\n  [s^3-1, 0],\n  [s, 0],\n  [-s-1, 1] ]\nThe GCD of s^3-1 and s is 1. We can use the Euclidean algorithm on these two rows.\nLet R_a = [s^3-1, 0] and R_b = [s, 0].\ns^3-1 = s*(s^2) - 1. So, R_a - s^2*R_b = [-1, 0].\nSo we can transform the matrix further by R2 <- R2 - s^2*R3\n[,\n  [-1, 0],\n  [s, 0],\n  [-s-1, 1] ]\nNow, use the new R2 to simplify others.\nR3_new = R3 + s*R2_new = [s+s(-1), 0+0] =.\nThe matrix is now:\n[,\n  [-1, 0],\n ,\n  [-s-1, 1] ]\nNow, we can use R2 to simplify R4.\nR4_new = R4 - (s+1)*R2_new = [-s-1 - (s+1)(-1), 1 - 0] = [-s-1+s+1, 1] =.\nSo the matrix becomes:\n[,\n  [-1, 0],\n ,\n  ]\nReordering the rows and removing zero rows gives:\n[ [-1, 0],\n  ]\nMultiplying the first row by -1 (which is a unimodular operation) gives:\nG(s) = [,\n         ] = I\n\nIf the row operations are correct, the GCRD is the identity matrix. Let's double check. All the row operations are of the form Ri <- Ri + P(s)*Rj, where P(s) is a polynomial. This corresponds to left-multiplying the matrix M by an elementary matrix, which is unimodular. The final matrix represents the GCRD.\nLet's recap the operations:\n1. R1' = R1 + s*R4\n2. R2' = R2 - s^2*R4\nThis yields M_1 = [, [s^3-1, 0], [s, 0], [-s-1, 1] ]\nThis seems correct.\n\n3. Let R2'' = R2' - s^2*R3 = [s^3-1 - s^2(s), 0] = [-1, 0]\nThis is a typo in my previous step. It should be s^2 * R3.\nR2'' = [s^3-1 - s^2*s, 0] = [-1, 0]. Ah, I had it right. s^3-1 - s^3 = -1. So, [ -1, 0].\nM_2 = [, [-1, 0], [s, 0], [-s-1, 1] ]\nThis is correct.\n\n4. R3' = R3 + s*R2'' = [s+s(-1), 0] =. Correct.\nM_3 = [, [-1, 0],, [-s-1, 1] ]\nThis is correct.\n\n5. R4' = R4 - (s+1)R2''. No, this operation is not on M_3, but on R4 of the previous stage. The row to be modified must use a different row that hasn't been modified in the same \"group\" of operations. The transformation from M_2 to M_3 only changed R3. We now have M_3. Let's operate on M_3.\nR4' = R4_of_M2 - (s+1)R2_of_M2\nThis gives R4' = [-s-1-(s+1)(-1), 1-0] = [-s-1+s+1, 1] =. Correct.\nM_4 = [, [-1, 0],, ]\nCorrect.\n\nThe final basis for the row space is given by [-1, 0] and. We can write this as a matrix:\nG(s) = [[-1, 0],]\nThis matrix is unimodular because its determinant is -1, which is a non-zero constant. Any matrix that is unimodularly equivalent to this, like [,], is also a GCRD.\nSo, the GCRD is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix). This implies that P1 and P2 are right coprime.\n\nLet me just quickly check if P2 divides P1 again, because it seemed plausible.\nP1 = Q * P2\n[[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] = [[q11, q12],[q21, q22]] * [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\ns*q11 + (-s-1)*q12 = s^2+s\n1*q12 = -s => q12 = -s.\ns*q11 + (-s-1)(-s) = s^2+s\ns*q11 + s^2+s = s^2+s\ns*q11 = 0 => q11 = 0.\nSo the first row of Q is [0, -s].\n\nNow the second row:\ns*q21 + (-s-1)*q22 = -s^2-1\n1*q22 = s^2 => q22 = s^2.\ns*q21 + (-s-1)(s^2) = -s^2-1\ns*q21 -s^3-s^2 = -s^2-1\ns*q21 = s^3-1\nq21 = (s^3-1)/s = s^2 - 1/s.\nSince q21 is not a polynomial, P2 does not right-divide P1. The calculation is definitely correct this time.\n\nSo, the GCRD calculation via row-reduction of the stacked matrix seems to be the most reliable method here. The method is sound and the calculations have been double-checked. The result that the GCRD is the identity matrix I stands.To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the method of row-reducing a stacked matrix formed by P1 and P2. Let the GCRD be denoted by D(s). If D(s) is a GCRD, then there exist polynomial matrices Q1(s) and Q2(s) such that:\nP1(s) = Q1(s)D(s)\nP2(s) = Q2(s)D(s)\n\nThe GCRD can be found by performing elementary row operations on the compound matrix M(s) formed by stacking P1 and P2:\nM(s) = [P1(s) ; P2(s)]\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n\nP2 = [[s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe form the stacked matrix M(s):\nM(s) =\n[ [s^2 + s, -s],   (R1)\n  [-s^2 - 1, s^2], (R2)\n  [s, 0],         (R3)\n  [-s - 1, 1] ]    (R4)\n\nThe goal is to simplify this matrix using elementary row operations (which correspond to left-multiplication by unimodular matrices) to a form [D(s); 0], where D(s) will be the GCRD.\n\n1.  Use row R4 to eliminate the terms in the second column of the other rows.\n    *   Replace R1 with R1 + s * R4:\n        [s^2 + s + s(-s - 1), -s + s*1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, 0] =\n    *   Replace R2 with R2 - s^2 * R4:\n        [-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s - 1), s^2 - s^2*1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0] = [s^3 - 1, 0]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M_1(s) =\n    [,\n      [s^3 - 1, 0],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n2.  The first row is now zero and can be ignored. We can further simplify the matrix using the rows that have a zero in the second column. Let's use R3 ([s, 0]) to simplify R2 ([s^3 - 1, 0]).\n    *   Replace R2 with R2 - s^2 * R3:\n        [s^3 - 1 - s^2(s), 0 - s^2(0)] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    M_2(s) =\n    [,\n      [-1, 0],\n      [s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]\n\n3.  Use the new R2 ([-1, 0]) to simplify R3 and R4.\n    *   Replace R3 with R3 + s * R2:\n        [s + s(-1), 0 + s(0)] = [s - s, 0] =\n    *   Replace R4 with R4 + (-s - 1) * R2:\n        [-s - 1 + (-s - 1)(-1), 1 + (-s - 1)(0)] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1] =\n\n    The final matrix is:\n    M_3(s) =\n    [,\n      [-1, 0],\n     ,\n      ]\n\n4.  Removing the zero rows and reordering, we get the GCRD:\n    D(s) = [[-1, 0],\n           ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is (-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1, which is a non-zero constant. A matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant is called a unimodular matrix. Any unimodular matrix is equivalent to the identity matrix in terms of being a GCRD. Therefore, the greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<\n[,\n]\n>>>"
