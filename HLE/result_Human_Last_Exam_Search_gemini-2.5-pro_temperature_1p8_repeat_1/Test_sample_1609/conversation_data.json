    "For a Boolean function with n variables, the maximal number of prime implicants is denoted by a(n). This value is given by the formula 2^(n-1).\n\nTo find a(4), we substitute n=4 into the formula:\n\na(4) = 2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8. This is confirmed in the context of a 4-variable Karnaugh map, which can have a maximum of 8 prime implicants.\n\n<<<8>>>"
