    "The user wants to find the 8-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\nThe given information is:\n*   `X(k)`, the 4-point DFT of `x(n)`, is `[1, j, -1, -j]`.\n*   `H(k)`, the 4-point DFT of `h(n)`, is `[0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n*   The new 8-point sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the decimation-in-time (DIT) property of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The DIT algorithm breaks down a DFT of size N into two DFTs of size N/2. In this case, we are doing the reverse: combining two N/2-point DFTs to find an N-point DFT.\n\nLet the 8-point sequence be `y(n)`. The even-indexed terms of `y(n)` correspond to `x(n)`, and the odd-indexed terms correspond to `h(n)`.\n*   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nThe 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, denoted as `Y(k)`, can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)`. The formula, derived from the radix-2 Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, is as follows:\n\nFor k = 0, 1, 2, 3:\n`Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n`Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n\nWhere `W_8^k` is the twiddle factor, defined as `exp(-j*2*pi*k/8)`.\n\nLet's calculate the values for `Y(k)`:\n\n**Twiddle Factors:**\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = cos(pi/4) - j*sin(pi/4) = (1-j)/sqrt(2)`\n*   `W_8^2 = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = W_8^1 * W_8^2 = ((1-j)/sqrt(2)) * (-j) = (-1-j)/sqrt(2)`\n\n**Calculation of Y(k):**\n\n*   **For k=0:**\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n    *   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=1:**\n    *   `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + ((1-j)/sqrt(2)) * (1+j) = j + (1 - j^2)/sqrt(2) = j + 2/sqrt(2) = j + sqrt(2)`\n    *   `Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - ((1-j)/sqrt(2)) * (1+j) = j - sqrt(2)`\n\n*   **For k=2:**\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n    *   `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n*   **For k=3:**\n    *   `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + ((-1-j)/sqrt(2)) * (1-j) = -j + (-1 + j - j + j^2)/sqrt(2) = -j - 2/sqrt(2) = -j - sqrt(2)`\n    *   `Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - ((-1-j)/sqrt(2)) * (1-j) = -j - (-sqrt(2)) = -j + sqrt(2)`\n\nCombining these results, the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n`[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
