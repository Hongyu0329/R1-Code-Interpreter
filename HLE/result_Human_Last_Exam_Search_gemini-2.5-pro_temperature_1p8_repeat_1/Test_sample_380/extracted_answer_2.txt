The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial for the purpose of calculating the normalized magnetic helicity of Alfven ion cyclotron waves. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (denoted as Y and Z) is a convention based on a coordinate system aligned with the solar wind flow, not the local magnetic field. Since AIC waves propagate along the local magnetic field, a precise calculation of normalized magnetic helicity requires using the magnetic field components perpendicular to the *local magnetic field vector*. At the L1 point, the interplanetary magnetic field is typically oriented at a significant angle to the radial direction due to the Parker spiral. Therefore, using components perpendicular to the radial direction is an approximation, and more accurate analyses often transform the data into a field-aligned coordinate system.
