    "Two primary methods exist for encoding multiple logical qubits in surface codes: utilizing multiple, distinct patches of the code, and introducing defects known as holes within a single patch. The question describes a scenario that combines both of these approaches.\n\nA standard patch of surface code without any defects typically encodes a single logical qubit. When holes are introduced into the fabric of the surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded within that patch increases.\n\nResearch in the field provides a direct correlation between the number of \"closed\" holes and the number of logical qubits. A surface code on a planar lattice that is punctured with *b* closed holes can encode *k* = *b* logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch of surface code that contains two closed holes can encode two logical qubits.\n\nGiven that the configuration in question consists of two such patches, and assuming the logical qubits from each patch are additive, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\nTherefore, with each of the two patches encoding two logical qubits, the total maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
