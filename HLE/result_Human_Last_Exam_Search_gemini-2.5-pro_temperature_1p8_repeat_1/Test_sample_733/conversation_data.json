    "There are infinitely many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset `S` of a group `G` is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case where `a` and `b` are the same element), their product `ab` is not in `S`. A product-free set `S` is \"maximal by inclusion\" if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n\nAn infinite number of such groups can be demonstrated by examining cyclic groups. For any prime number `p` greater than or equal to 5, the cyclic group of order `p`, denoted `C_p`, contains a maximal product-free set of size 2. Since there are infinitely many prime numbers, there are infinitely many such groups.\n\nFor example, in the group `C_5` (the integers modulo 5 under addition, though typically defined multiplicatively in this context), the set `{1, 4}` (or `{x, x^4}` in multiplicative notation) is a maximal product-free set of size 2. Similarly, in `C_7`, the set `{1, 3}` is a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nAdditionally, other types of finite groups also possess these sets. For instance:\n*   The cyclic group of order 4, `C_4`.\n*   The Klein-four group, `V_4`.\n*   The symmetric group on 3 elements, `S_3`.\n\nThe classification of which finite groups have such a set is a known result in group theory, although some initial publications contained errors. The established consensus is that a finite group `G` has a maximal product-free set of size 2 if and only if `G` is not the trivial group and is not isomorphic to a group of the form `(C_2)^n × C_3` for some integer `n ≥ 1`. As most finite groups do not fall into this specific class of exceptions, and given the existence of infinite families of groups like `C_p` (for `p ≥ 5`) that do contain these sets, the number of such groups is infinite.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
