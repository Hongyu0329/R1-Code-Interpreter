    "The provided sequence of numbers does not follow a discernible mathematical pattern. An analysis of the differences and ratios between the numbers, as well as searches in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), did not reveal any underlying mathematical rule.\n\nInstead, the evidence strongly suggests that the sequence is composed of bus service numbers in Singapore. Many of the numbers in the sequence, including 10, 36, 41, 49, 62, 67, 93, 111, 124, 142, and 155, correspond to actual bus routes operated by SBS Transit in Singapore. For example, multiple search results reference details about bus service 111. The repetition of numbers in the sequence, such as `67, 67, 67` and `124, 124, 124`, further supports the idea that this is not a mathematical progression but rather a list of items, in this case, likely bus routes for a journey or a specific list.\n\nGiven that the sequence is likely based on real-world data and not a mathematical formula, it is impossible to predict the next number without additional context about the purpose or origin of the list.\n\n<<<The provided sequence is not a mathematical sequence but appears to correspond to a series of bus routes in Singapore. Therefore, the next number cannot be determined without additional context.>>>"
