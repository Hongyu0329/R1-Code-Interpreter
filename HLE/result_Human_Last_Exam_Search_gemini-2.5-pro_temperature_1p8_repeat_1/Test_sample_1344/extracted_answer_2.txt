An optimal dual-function catalyst would consist of a Group IV metal, either zirconium or hafnium, supported on sulfated alumina (AlS) with simple alkyl ligands. This combination is highly effective for both the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins into short saturated alkanes and for olefin polymerization. Zirconium offers the highest activity for hydrogenolysis, while hafnium provides a good balance of activity and thermal stability, with the support being crucial for generating the active cationic catalyst.
