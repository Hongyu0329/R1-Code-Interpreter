    "To find the separatrix of the system of differential equations, we first need to identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Often, these are the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n\nThe given system is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are considering the upper half-plane, where $u \\geq 0$.\n\n### 1. Finding Equilibrium Points\n\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFirst, let's solve $u'(t) = 0$:\n$$(u-1)u^2 = 0$$\nThis gives us two possibilities for $u$: $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n**Case 1: u = 0**\nSubstitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$$\n$$2d^2 = 0$$\nThis implies $d=0$. So, one equilibrium point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n**Case 2: u = 1**\nSubstitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$$\n$$2d^2 + 2d = 0$$\n$$2d(d+1) = 0$$\nThis implies $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, two more equilibrium points are $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n### 2. Classifying Equilibrium Points\n\nTo classify these points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nwhere $f(d,u) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3+u^4$ and $g(d,u) = u^3-u^2$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = (10u-3)d - 3u^2+4u^3$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive (degenerate critical point).\n*   **At (0, 1):** $J(0,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & (10(1)-3)(0) - 3(1)^2+4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   **At (-1, 1):** $J(-1,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & (10(1)-3)(-1) - 3(1)^2+4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n### 3. Finding the Separatrix\n\nSeparatrices are often the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. Let's look for an invariant manifold that passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. An invariant manifold is a curve, say $d=f(u)$, such that any trajectory starting on this curve stays on it.\nThis implies that the time derivative of $d-f(u)$ must be zero when $d=f(u)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(d-f(u)) = d' - f'(u)u' = 0$$\nLet's test a simple polynomial form for the manifold, such as $d = -u^2$. This curve has the convenient property that it passes through two of the equilibrium points:\n*   If $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. This is the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n*   If $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. This is the degenerate equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\nLet's check if $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold.\nIf $d(t) = -u(t)^2$, then by the chain rule, its time derivative is $d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t)$.\nWe already know that $u'(t) = u^2(u-1)$.\nSo, we have $d'(t) = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original first differential equation:\n$$d'(t)=2(-u^2)^2+(-3u+5u^2)(-u^2)-u^3(1-u)$$\n$$d'(t)=2u^4+(3u^3-5u^4)-(-u^4+u^3)$$\n$$d'(t)=2u^4+3u^3-5u^4+u^4-u^3$$\n$$d'(t)=(2-5+1)u^4+(3-1)u^3$$\n$$d'(t)=-2u^4+2u^3$$\n\nThe expression for $d'(t)$ derived from the substitution matches the one derived from the system's equation. This confirms that the curve defined by $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nSince this manifold passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$, it represents the unstable manifold of this saddle (as trajectories move away from it for $t>0$). An invariant manifold containing a saddle point is a separatrix. It separates the phase space into regions of differing trajectory behavior.\n\nThus, the equation for the separatrix is $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
