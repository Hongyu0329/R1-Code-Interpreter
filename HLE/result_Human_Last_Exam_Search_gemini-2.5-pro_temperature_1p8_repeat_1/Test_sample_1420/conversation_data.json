    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 can be calculated using the epsilon (ε) expansion.\n\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative approach performed around the upper critical dimension, d_c, where mean-field theory becomes exact. For a system with a scalar order parameter, which falls into the Ising universality class (or O(n) model with n=1), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4.\n\nThe expansion parameter ε is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension:\nε = d_c - d\n\nFor a spatial dimension of d=3, the value of ε is:\nε = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nThe critical exponent α can be expressed as a power series in ε. To the first order in ε, the expression for the O(n) model is:\nα = (4-n) / (2(n+8)) * ε + O(ε²)\n\nFor the specific case of a system with a single-component (scalar) order parameter, we use the Ising model (n=1). Substituting n=1 into the formula gives:\nα = (4-1) / (2(1+8)) * ε = 3 / 18 * ε = ε / 6\n\nBy setting ε = 1 for the three-dimensional system, we obtain the first-order estimate for the specific heat exponent:\nα = 1/6\n\nIt is important to note that ε=1 is not a small parameter, so this first-order calculation provides only an approximation. The ε-expansion is a divergent series, and for precise results at d=3, higher-order terms and resummation techniques (like Borel summation) are required. Such advanced calculations yield a value of α ≈ 0.110. However, the direct first-order calculation as shown above is a standard textbook result of the ε-expansion.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
