    "The minimal discriminant of the curve defined by $y^2 = x^6 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1$ is -94144.\n\nThe given equation describes a genus 2 hyperelliptic curve. To find its minimal discriminant, one typically searches for a model of the curve over the rational numbers that has the smallest possible discriminant in absolute value. This process often involves complex algorithms and transformations.\n\nThe curve can be identified in the L-Functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), a comprehensive database of mathematical objects. In the LMFDB, the curve is assigned the label 47072.a.188288.1. The database provides a minimal model for this curve and lists its key properties, including its minimal discriminant.\n\nWhile the originally provided model has a polynomial discriminant of -200448, the LMFDB provides an isomorphic, minimal model with a smaller discriminant. The minimal model is given by the equation:\n\n$y^2 + (x^3+x+1)y = x^5 - x^4 + 3x^3 + x^2 - x$\n\nThe discriminant of this minimal model, and thus the minimal discriminant of the curve, is stated to be $-2^6 \\cdot 1471 = -94144$.\n\n<<<âˆ’94144>>>"
