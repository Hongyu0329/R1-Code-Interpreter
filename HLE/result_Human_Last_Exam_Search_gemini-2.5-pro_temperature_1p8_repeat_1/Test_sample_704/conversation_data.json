    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself corresponds to the musical notes **A and B**.\n\nNewton, in his work *Opticks* from 1704, created a circular diagram that associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the notes of a musical scale. He based this on the Dorian musical mode, starting with the note D. In this arrangement, the colors are ordered as they appear in a rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\nThe primary colors of red, yellow, and blue were foundational to his theory. The combination of yellow and blue light results in the color green. On Newton's color circle, each of the seven colors corresponds to a specific musical note:\n*   Red: D\n*   Orange: E\n*   Yellow: F\n*   Green: G\n*   Blue: A\n*   Indigo: B\n*   Violet: C\n\nTherefore, the range between green and blue on Newton's color circle corresponds to the musical notes **A and B**.\n\n<<<A, B>>>"
