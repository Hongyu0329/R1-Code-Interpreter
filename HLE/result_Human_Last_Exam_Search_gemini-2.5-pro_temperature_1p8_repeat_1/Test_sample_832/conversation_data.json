    "I am unable to provide a precise count of the entrelacés performed by Natalia Osipova in her debut as Nikiya in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009.\n\nNumerous video recordings and discussions of this specific performance are available online, confirming the event took place and was documented. However, detailed choreographic analyses or written accounts that specify the exact number of each ballet step, including entrelacés, are not available in the search results. Answering the question would require direct observation and counting of the steps in the video, which is beyond my current capabilities.\n\nWhile there are many reviews and discussions of her performance, they focus on her interpretation, artistry, and overall technical skill rather than providing a step-by-step breakdown of the choreography.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
