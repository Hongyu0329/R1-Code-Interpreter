    "The value of the function `f(a, b, c)` can be determined by recognizing its recursive structure. The function is non-zero only if `b` is an even integer and `c` is a multiple of 3. In such cases, `f(a,b,c)` corresponds to the multinomial coefficient:\n`f(a,b,c) = (a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!) = C(a + b/2 + c/3, a, b/2, c/3)`\n\nThe problem asks to compute `f(αp, βp, γp) mod p`, where `p` is the Mersenne prime `2^127 - 1`. The arguments `αp`, `βp`, and `γp` are given by summations.\n\nFirst, it is necessary to determine the values of `αp`, `βp`, and `γp` modulo `p`.\n*   `αp = Σ(p^(3i) + 3p^(3i+1) + 4p^(3i+2))`\n    Modulo `p`, all terms where the power of `p` is greater than 0 vanish. Only the `i=0` term contributes a non-zero value: `p^0 + 3p^1 + 4p^2 ≡ 1 (mod p)`.\n*   `βp = Σ(8p^(3i) + 4p^(3i+1) + 4p^(3i+2))`\n    Similarly, modulo `p`, only the `i=0` term is relevant: `8p^0 + 4p^1 + 4p^2 ≡ 8 (mod p)`.\n*   `γp = Σ(3p^(3i) + 9p^(3i+1) + 12p^(3i+2))`\n    Modulo `p`, the `i=0` term gives: `3p^0 + 9p^1 + 12p^2 ≡ 3 (mod p)`.\n\nThe function `f` requires that `βp` be even and `γp` be a multiple of 3.\n*   `βp` is a sum of terms `8p^(3i)`, `4p^(3i+1)`, and `4p^(3i+2)`, all of which are even. The sum of even numbers is even.\n*   `γp` is a sum of terms `3p^(3i)`, `9p^(3i+1)`, and `12p^(3i+2)`, all of which are multiples of 3. The sum is therefore a multiple of 3.\n\nTo compute the multinomial coefficient modulo a prime `p`, we can use the generalization of Lucas's Theorem. This theorem states that for `C(n, k1, k2, ...)` modulo `p`, we can expand `n`, `k1`, `k2`, ... in base `p` and compute the product of the multinomial coefficients of the corresponding digits.\n\nLet `k1 = αp`, `k2 = βp/2`, and `k3 = γp/3`. Expanding them as polynomials in `p` gives their base-`p` representation:\n*   `k1 = αp = Σ(1*p^(3i) + 3*p^(3i+1) + 4*p^(3i+2))`. The digits are `(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, ...)`.\n*   `k2 = βp/2 = Σ(4*p^(3i) + 2*p^(3i+1) + 2*p^(3i+2))`. The digits are `(4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, ...)`.\n*   `k3 = γp/3 = Σ(1*p^(3i) + 3*p^(3i+1) + 4*p^(3i+2))`. The digits are `(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, ...)`.\n\nLet `n = k1 + k2 + k3`. The base-`p` digits of `n` (`ni`) are the sum of the digits of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, as there are no carries (the sum of digits is always less than `p`).\n*   For `j` congruent to `0 mod 3`: `n_j = 1+4+1 = 6`.\n*   For `j` congruent to `1 mod 3`: `n_j = 3+2+3 = 8`.\n*   For `j` congruent to `2 mod 3`: `n_j = 4+2+4 = 10`.\n\nBy Lucas's Theorem, `f(αp, βp, γp) mod p` is the product of `C(n_j, k1,j, k2,j, k3,j)` for all `j`. This product has a repeating cycle of three terms:\n*   `T0 = C(6, 1, 4, 1) = 6!/(1!4!1!) = 30`.\n*   `T1 = C(8, 3, 2, 3) = 8!/(3!2!3!) = 560`.\n*   `T2 = C(10, 4, 2, 4) = 10!/(4!2!4!) = 3150`.\n\nLet `K = T0 * T1 * T2 = 30 * 560 * 3150 = 52,920,000`.\nThe number of terms in the product is determined by the highest power of `p` in the summation for `αp`. The summation goes up to `i = (3p-1)/2`, so the total number of product terms is `3*((3p-1)/2) + 3 = (9p+3)/2`. The number of cycles `(T0*T1*T2)` is `((9p+3)/2) / 3 = (3p+1)/2`.\n\nThe final value is `K^((3p+1)/2) mod p`. Using Fermat's Little Theorem:\n`K^((3p+1)/2) = K^(3(p-1)/2 + 2) = (K^((p-1)/2))^3 * K^2 (mod p)`\nThe term `K^((p-1)/2)` is the Legendre symbol `(K/p)`.\n`K = 2^6 * 3^3 * 5^4 * 7^2`. So, `(K/p) = (3^3/p) = (3/p)`.\n\nBy the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity: `(3/p) = (p/3) * (-1)^((p-1)/2 * (3-1)/2) = (p/3) * (-1)^((p-1)/2)`.\nFor `p = 2^127 - 1`:\n*   `p ≡ (-1)^127 - 1 ≡ -2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)`. So, `(p/3) = 1`.\n*   `p = 2^127 - 1`. Since `127 ≥ 2`, `2^127` is divisible by 4, so `p ≡ 0 - 1 ≡ 3 (mod 4)`. This implies `(p-1)/2` is odd.\nTherefore, `(-1)^((p-1)/2) = -1`.\nThis gives `(K/p) = (3/p) = 1 * (-1) = -1`.\n\nSubstituting this back, the result is `(-1)^3 * K^2 = -K^2 (mod p)`.\n`K = 52,920,000`, so `K^2 = 2,799,326,400,000,000`.\nThe final value is `-2,799,326,400,000,000`.\n\n"
