    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$. Then a character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nIn our case, a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $36036$ must be of the form:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$\nwhere:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters:\n$o(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o(\\chi_1), o(\\chi_2), o(\\chi_3), o(\\chi_4), o(\\chi_5))$.\nWe are looking for characters where this order is $6$. This requires that all individual orders $o(\\chi_i)$ must be divisors of $6$.\n\n### 4. Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe now determine the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor, restricting to those whose order is a divisor of 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one principal character (conductor 1, order 1) and one non-principal character (conductor 4, order 2). This single primitive character has order 2. So there is 1 choice for $\\chi_1$, and its order is $o_1=2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo 3. The characters modulo 3 form a group of order $\\phi(3)=2$. The primitive characters modulo 9 are those whose orders in the group $C_6$ do not divide 2. The possible orders are 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So there are $2+2=4$ choices for $\\chi_2$. The order $o_2$ is either 3 or 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. A character is primitive if it is not the principal character (which has order 1). We need the order to be a divisor of 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_3$. The order $o_3$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. Primitive characters are all non-principal ones. We need the order to be a divisor of 6. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. The only divisor of 6 among these (other than 1) is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    So there is only 1 choice for $\\chi_4$, and its order is $o_4=2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need the order to be a divisor of 6. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The divisors of 6 among these are 1, 2, 3, 6. Primitive characters have order greater than 1.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    So there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_5$. The order $o_5$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nLet's analyze the lcm of the orders for any combination of the chosen characters:\n$o(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5) = \\text{lcm}(2, o_2, o_3, 2, o_5)$.\n\n*   All possible orders ($o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5$) are divisors of 6. Therefore, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6.\n*   The order of $\\chi_1$ is $o_1=2$. This ensures that the lcm is a multiple of 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_2$ is either 3 or 6, so it is always a multiple of 3. This ensures that the lcm is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. Combined with the fact that the lcm must be a divisor of 6, we conclude that the order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is always exactly 6 for any valid choice of component characters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character:\nNumber of characters = (Choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_5$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n"
