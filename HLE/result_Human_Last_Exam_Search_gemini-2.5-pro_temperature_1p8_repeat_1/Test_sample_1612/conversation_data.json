    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), a hitter earns the Triple Crown by leading their league—either the American League (AL) or the National League (NL)—in three specific statistical categories in the same season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n\nIn the history of the AL and NL, this impressive feat has been accomplished by 10 players a total of 12 times since RBIs became an official statistic in 1920. The most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers in 2012, which was the first time in 45 years a player had achieved this milestone.\n\nThe list of MLB Triple Crown winners in the American and National Leagues includes:\n\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, AL)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, AL)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966, AL)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956, AL)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947, AL)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937, NL)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934, AL)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, AL)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933, NL)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925, NL)\n\nBefore RBIs were officially recorded in 1920, several other players led their league in these three categories, including players from the Negro Leagues, which are now officially recognized by MLB. This brings the total number of unique Triple Crown winners across all recognized major leagues to 27. Notably, Oscar Charleston won three Triple Crowns in the Negro Leagues.\n\nIt is a rare accomplishment, with eleven of the thirteen eligible players who have won a batting Triple Crown being elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n<<<10>>>"
