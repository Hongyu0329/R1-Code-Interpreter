    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numbers.\n\nThe first number is **MDCCCLXXIX**.\n*   M represents 1000\n*   DCCC represents 800\n*   LXX represents 70\n*   IX represents 9\n\nAdding these values together: 1000 + 800 + 70 + 9 = 1879.\nTherefore, MDCCCLXXIX is equal to 1879.\n\nThe second number is **MDCCLXXXXI**.\n*   M represents 1000\n*   DCC represents 700\n*   LXXXX represents 90\n*   I represents 1\n\nAdding these values together: 1000 + 700 + 90 + 1 = 1791.\n\nNow, we perform the subtraction as indicated in the equation:\n1879 - 1791 = 88.\n\nThe solution to the equation is 88.\n<<<88>>>"
