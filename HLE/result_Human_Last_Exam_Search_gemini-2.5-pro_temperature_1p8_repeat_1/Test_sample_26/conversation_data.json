    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 0.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Identify the space**: A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, is a complex surface, meaning it has a complex dimension of 2 and a real dimension of 4.\n\n2.  **Apply the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for Homotopy Groups**: A powerful result by Klaus Lamotke provides a generalization of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for the homotopy groups of a smooth hypersurface. The theorem states that if $F$ is a smooth hypersurface of complex dimension $m \\geq 2$ in $\\mathbb{P}_n$, then the inclusion map $i: F \\to \\mathbb{P}_n$ induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(F) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{P}_n)$ for all $k > m$.\n\n3.  **Check the conditions for the theorem**: In this case, $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so its complex dimension is $m=2$. The question asks for the third homotopy group, so we are interested in $k=3$. Since $k=3 > m=2$, the condition of Lamotke's theorem is met. Therefore, the inclusion map induces an isomorphism:\n    $$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) $$\n\n4.  **Compute the third homotopy group of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$**: The homotopy groups of complex projective spaces can be determined from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the Hopf fibration. For $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the fibration is:\n    $$ S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3 $$\n    The long exact sequence in homotopy includes the following segment:\n    $$ \\dots \\to \\pi_3(S^1) \\to \\pi_3(S^7) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_2(S^1) \\to \\dots $$\n\n5.  **Use known homotopy groups of spheres**: The homotopy groups of the circle $S^1$ are $\\pi_k(S^1)=0$ for $k \\geq 2$. Thus, $\\pi_3(S^1)=0$ and $\\pi_2(S^1)=0$. Furthermore, for a sphere $S^n$, the homotopy groups $\\pi_k(S^n)$ are trivial for $k < n$. In our case, for $S^7$, we have $\\pi_3(S^7) = 0$ since $3 < 7$.\n\n6.  **Determine $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$**: Substituting these trivial groups into the long exact sequence gives:\n    $$ \\dots \\to 0 \\to 0 \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to 0 \\to \\dots $$\n    This implies that $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is the trivial group, i.e., $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion**: Since $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ and $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, it follows that $\\pi_3(X) = 0$. The rank of a group is the size of a minimal generating set. For the trivial group $\\{0\\}$, the rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
