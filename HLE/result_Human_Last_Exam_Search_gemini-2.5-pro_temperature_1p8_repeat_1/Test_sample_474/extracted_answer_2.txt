The proposed approach has limited ecological validity. While using human observers can be a useful starting point to generate hypotheses about mimicry rings, it is fundamentally flawed because human vision differs significantly from that of the primary predators of *Bombus* species, particularly birds. The inability of humans to perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which birds can see, means that crucial visual signals that define the mimicry syndrome from a predator's perspective could be missed entirely. This can lead to inaccurate clustering of species. Therefore, while the method might provide a preliminary grouping, it is not a valid final determinant of mimicry syndromes without further testing using techniques that account for the predator's actual visual capabilities, such as spectrophotometry and avian vision models.
