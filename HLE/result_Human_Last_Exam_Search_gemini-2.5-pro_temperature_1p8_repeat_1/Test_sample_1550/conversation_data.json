    "The two given plane quadrics are:\n1.  `164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0`\n2.  `864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0`\n\nTo determine the number of real intersection points, one can solve this system of two quadratic equations in two variables, x and y. Analytically, this process can be quite complex, as it typically involves eliminating one variable to obtain a quartic equation in the other.\n\nA more direct method is to graph the two quadrics and visually inspect the number of intersections. By using a graphing utility, we can plot these two implicit curves.\n\nThe discriminant `B^2 - 4AC` can be used to classify the conic sections.\nFor the first equation, `A=164`, `B=-216`, `C=72`, the discriminant is `(-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576`. Since the discriminant is less than 0, the conic is an ellipse.\nFor the second equation, `A=864`, `B=-1056`, `C=324`, the discriminant is `(-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608`. Since this discriminant is also negative, the second conic is also an ellipse.\n\nUpon plotting both ellipses on a graph, it becomes evident that they intersect at two distinct points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
