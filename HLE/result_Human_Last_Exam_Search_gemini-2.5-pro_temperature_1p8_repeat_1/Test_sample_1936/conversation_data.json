    "The smallest number `n` for which there exists a set `G` of `n` elements with a binary operation that does not form a group depends on whether the empty set is considered.\n\n### Case 1: Non-empty sets are required\n\nMost standard definitions of a group require the set `G` to be non-empty. Following this common convention:\n\n*   **n = 1:** Let `G = {a}`. The only possible binary operation is `a · a = a`. This structure satisfies all group axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** The result `a` is in `G`.\n    *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · (a · a)` is true since all evaluations lead to `a`.\n    *   **Identity Element:** `a` acts as the identity element, since `a · a = a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** `a` is its own inverse because `a · a = a`, and `a` is the identity.\n    Therefore, any set of size 1 with a binary operation is always a group (the trivial group).\n\n*   **n = 2:** Let `G = {a, b}`. It is possible to define a binary operation on `G` such that it is *not* a group. For instance, define the operation `*` such that for any element `x` in `G`, `x * y = x`. The operation table would be:\n\n| * | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | a |\n| b | b | b |\n\nThis structure, known as a left-zero semigroup, is not a group because it fails to have an identity element:\n*   There is no element `e` in `G` such that `e * x = x` for all `x` in `G`. If `e=a`, then `a * b = a ≠ b`. If `e=b`, then `b * a = b ≠ a`.\n\nSince n=1 always forms a group and a non-group structure can be created with n=2, the smallest such positive integer is 2.\n\n### Case 2: The empty set (n=0) is considered\n\nIf we consider `n=0`, the set is the empty set, `G = {}`. A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G × G` is also the empty set, there is exactly one such function (the empty function). With this operation, one must check the group axioms:\n*   **Associativity:** This property is vacuously true as there are no elements to test.\n*   **Identity Element:** The definition of a group requires the existence of an identity element *in* the set G. Since the empty set has no elements, it cannot contain an identity element.\n\nTherefore, the empty set with its unique binary operation is not a group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFollowing the predominant convention in mathematics that a group must be a non-empty set, the smallest number `n` is 2. If the empty set were allowed, the answer would be 0.\n\n<<<2>>>"
