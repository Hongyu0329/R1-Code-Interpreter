    "To determine the total welfare for the given supply and demand functions, we must first find the market equilibrium point and then calculate the consumer and producer surpluses.\n\n**1. Finding Market Equilibrium**\n\nThe market equilibrium is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. This occurs when the price and quantity are the same for both functions.\n\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q³ - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q))\n\nBy setting the two equations equal to each other, we can find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E):\nln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))\n\nThis equation is transcendental and does not have an analytical solution. It must be solved using numerical methods, for which various online equation solvers are available. Using a numerical solver, we find the equilibrium quantity:\n\n**Q_E ≈ 4.6888**\n\nWe can find the equilibrium price (P_E) by substituting Q_E into either function. Using the demand function:\n\n**P_E** = 18e^(-arctan(4.6888)) **≈ 4.6169**\n\n**2. Calculating Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). It represents the total benefit to society from the production and consumption of the good. It can be calculated by finding the area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\nTotal Welfare = ∫₀^(Q_E) D(Q) dQ - ∫_(Q_min)^(Q_E) S(Q) dQ\n\nHere, D(Q) is the demand function and S(Q) is the supply function. The supply function is defined only for Q³ - 2 > 0, so its lower integration bound (Q_min) is ∛2.\n\nThe calculation involves two definite integrals:\n1.  The area under the demand curve from Q=0 to Q_E.\n2.  The area under the supply curve from Q=∛2 to Q_E.\n\nThese integrals are calculated using numerical integration methods, which can be performed by online calculators.\n\n*   **Area under Demand Curve:** ∫₀⁴.⁶⁸⁸⁸ [18e^(-arctan(Q))] dQ ≈ 53.4735\n*   **Area under Supply Curve:** ∫∛₂⁴.⁶⁸⁸⁸ [ln(Q³ - 2)] dQ ≈ 8.8719\n\nTotal welfare is the difference between these two areas:\n\nTotal Welfare ≈ 53.4735 - 8.8719 = 44.6016\n\nThus, the total welfare is approximately 44.60.\n\n<<<44.60>>>"
