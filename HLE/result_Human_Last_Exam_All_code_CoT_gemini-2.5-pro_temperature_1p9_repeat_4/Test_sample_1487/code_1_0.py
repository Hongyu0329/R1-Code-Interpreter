# The mathematical derivation simplifies the problem to a final arithmetic calculation.
# This script computes this result and presents the answer as requested.

# The original expression is: (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# Our derivation showed that:
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)

# Substituting this into the expression, the numerator becomes:
# 2 * ||alpha||^2 = 2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1) = (pi^2/6 - 1)

# So, the fraction part of the expression simplifies to:
# (pi^2/6 - 1) / (pi^2/6 - 1) = 1

# This reduces the entire expression to a simple sum.
term1 = 1
term2 = 10**15
result = term1 + term2

# The problem requests to output each number in the final equation.
# We present the final simplified equation and its result.
