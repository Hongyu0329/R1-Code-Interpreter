    This function identifies the indices of insect tribes whose immatures are 
    unlikely to be collected using a beat-sheet method based on their life history.

    - 1) Apis: Larvae are in hives, not on plants. (Unlikely)
    - 2) Melipotini: Caterpillars are external foliage feeders. (Likely)
    - 3) Eupholini: Larvae are internal borers or root feeders. (Unlikely)
    - 4) Acritini: Larvae live in dung/carrion/litter, not on plants. (Unlikely)
    - 5) Oxyptilini: Caterpillars are often external feeders. (Likely)
    - 6) Dictyophorini: Nymphs live on plant stems/leaves. (Likely)
    - 7) Acanthocerini: Larvae are in decaying wood or ant nests. (Unlikely)

    The code will select the indices of the unlikely tribes and print them in 
    ascending order, separated by commas.
