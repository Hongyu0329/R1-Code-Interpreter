    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: First, we need to establish the precise structure of a \"barbell graph with 10 nodes.\" The most common and symmetrical interpretation is a graph constructed from two identical complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge. To have 10 nodes in total, we must have two `K_5` (complete graphs with 5 nodes each). These two `K_5` cliques are disjoint, and one node from the first clique is connected to one node from the second clique.\n2.  **Identify the Bottleneck Edge**: The \"bottleneck edge\" is the single edge that connects the two `K_5` cliques. Let's call the nodes it connects `u` and `v`.\n3.  **Understand Randomized Uniform Gossiping**: The problem describes a specific sampling process. In each step of this process:\n    *   A node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all `N` nodes (with probability `1/N`).\n    *   Then, one of that node's neighbors is selected uniformly at random (with probability `1/degree(node)`).\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees**: To find the sampling probability, we need the degree of the nodes `u` and `v` connected by the bottleneck edge. A node in a `K_5` is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique. The bottleneck edge adds one more connection. Thus, the degree of nodes `u` and `v` will be `(5 - 1) + 1 = 5`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability**: The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is the probability of picking `u` and then its neighbor `v`, plus the probability of picking `v` and then its neighbor `u`.\n    *   `P(sampling edge (u,v)) = P(picking u) * P(v is neighbor of u) + P(picking v) * P(u is neighbor of v)`\n    *   `P(sampling edge (u,v)) = (1/N) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/N) * (1/deg(v))`\n6.  **Execute and Present**: We will write a Python script to formalize these calculations and print out each step of the equation along with the final probability.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bottleneck_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the graph parameters based on the problem description.\n    # A barbell graph with 10 nodes is interpreted as two K_5 cliques\n    # connected by a single edge.\n    num_nodes_total = 10\n    nodes_per_clique = 5\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing a barbell graph with N = {num_nodes_total} nodes.\")\n    print(f\"The graph consists of two complete graphs (K_{nodes_per_clique}) connected by one bottleneck edge.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    # Let the bottleneck edge be (u, v).\n    # Degree of u = (connections inside its K_5) + (the bottleneck connection)\n    degree_bridge_node = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1\n    \n    print(\"The gossiping process is as follows:\")\n    print(\"1.
