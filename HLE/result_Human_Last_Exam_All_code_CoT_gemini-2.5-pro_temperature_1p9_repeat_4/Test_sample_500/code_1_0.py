    # 1. Define the parameters from the problem description.
    # Arrival rate lambda
    lambda_rate = 3
    # The service time survival function P(S > u) is given for large u.
    # P(S > u) = c1/u + c2/(u * ln(u))
    # where c1 is the coefficient of the 1/u term, and c2=m is a positive integer.
    c1 = 1/3
    # The specific value of m (as long as it's a positive integer) does not affect the conclusion.

    # 2. Identify the queueing model.
    # The arrivals are a Poisson process (M), service times are from a General distribution (G),
    # and customers enter service immediately, implying infinite servers (inf).
    # This is an M/G/inf queue.

    # 3. Analyze the expected service time E[S].
    # The behavior of an M/G/inf queue depends on the expected service time E[S].
    # E[S] is calculated as the integral of the survival function P(S > u) from 0 to infinity.
    # E[S] = integral_0^inf P(S > u) du
    # The integral is guaranteed to diverge if the integral for large u diverges.
    # Let's analyze the integral of the tail: integral(c1/u + m/(u*ln(u))) du.
    # The integral of c1/u is c1 * ln(u). As u -> infinity, ln(u) -> infinity.
    # This term alone is enough to make the integral diverge.
    # Therefore, the expected service time E[S] is infinite.

    # 4. State the consequence for the M/G/inf queue.
    # A standard result in queueing theory states that for an M/G/inf queue with a
    # positive arrival rate (lambda > 0) and infinite mean service time (E[S] = infinity),
    # the number of customers in the system, X_t, grows without bound.
    # That is, lim_{t->inf} X_t = infinity, almost surely.

    # 5. Conclude the value of the limit inferior.
    # If the number of customers X_t tends to infinity, its limit inferior must also be infinity.
    final_liminf = float('inf')

    # 6. Print the reasoning with the given numbers.
