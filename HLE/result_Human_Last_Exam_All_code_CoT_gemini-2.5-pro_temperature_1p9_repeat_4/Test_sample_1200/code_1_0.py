    print("   - This process can lead to daughter cells that are homozygous for a specific allele (e.g., 'a/a') from a heterozygous parent cell ('A/a').")

    print("   - This is a valid mechanism that CAUSES copy-neutral LOH.\n")

    # Analysis of Option B
    print("B. A deletion of a chromosomal region:")
    print("   - This results in the loss of an allele, leading to a hemizygous state (e.g., 'a/-').")
    print("   - This is LOH, but it is NOT copy-neutral because the total gene copy number is reduced from 2 to 1.\n")

    # Analysis of Option C
    print("C. Trisomy:")
    print("   - This is the presence of three copies of a chromosome.")
    print("   - This is a copy number GAIN, not a copy-neutral event.\n")

    # Analysis of Option D
    print("D. Uniparental disomy (UPD):")
    print("   - This is the state where a cell has two copies of a chromosome, but both come from a single parent.")
    print("   - By definition, it is 'disomy' (two copies), making it copy-neutral.")
    print("   - It is also 'uniparental', meaning the genetic information from the other parent is lost, resulting in LOH.")
    print("   - This term perfectly describes the state of copy-neutral LOH.\n")

    # Analysis of Option E
    print("E. Duplication of a chromosomal region:")
    print("   - This results in an increase in the number of gene copies (e.g., three or more).")
    print("   - This is a copy number GAIN, not a copy-neutral event.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("While mitotic recombination (A) is a process that can cause copy-neutral LOH, Uniparental Disomy (D) is the most accurate and descriptive term for the resulting state itself. Acquired UPD is often used as a synonym for copy-neutral LOH in the context of tumorigenesis.")
