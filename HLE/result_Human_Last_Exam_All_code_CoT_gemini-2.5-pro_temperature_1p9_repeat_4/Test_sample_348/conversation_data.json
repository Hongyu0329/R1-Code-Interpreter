    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium point, which is where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_E`) and the price is the same (`P_E`). After finding the equilibrium price (`P_E`) and quantity (`Q_E`), we can calculate the total welfare by summing the consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define Supply and Demand Functions**: Represent the given equations `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)` and `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))` in Python.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: Numerically solve the equation `ln(Q_E^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_E))` to find the equilibrium quantity `Q_E`. Then, calculate the equilibrium price `P_E` using either function.\n3.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)**: CS is the area between the demand curve and the equilibrium price line from Q=0 to Q=Q_E. We will compute it using the integral: `CS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (Demand(Q) - P_E) dQ`.\n4.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)**: PS is the area between the equilibrium price line and the supply curve. The supply function is defined for `Q > 2^(1/3)`. We will compute PS using the integral: `PS = ∫[c to Q_E] (P_E - Supply(Q)) dQ`, where `c = 2^(1/3)`.\n5.  **Calculate Total Welfare (TW)**: The total welfare is the sum of the two surpluses: `TW = CS + PS`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `scipy` library for numerical solving and integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\ndef demand_p(q):\n  \"\"\"Defines the demand function P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q)).\"\"\"\n  return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\ndef supply_p(q):\n  \"\"\"Defines the supply function P = ln(Q^3 - 2).\"\"\"\n  # The function is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0\n  with np.errstate(invalid='ignore'): # Suppress log of negative number warnings during solve\n    return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium\ndef equilibrium_equation(q):\n  \"\"\"Equation to solve for equilibrium: Demand(Q) - Supply(Q) = 0.\"\"\"\n  return demand_p(q) - supply_p(q)\n\n# An initial guess is needed for the numerical solver.\n# Let's try Q=4: P_demand is ~4.78, P_supply is ~4.13. They are close.\ninitial_guess = 4.0\n# fsolve finds the root of the equation, which is our equilibrium quantity Q_E\nQ_E = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess)[0]\n\n# Calculate the equilibrium price P_E using the demand function\nP_E = demand_p(Q_E)\n\nprint(f\"Market Equilibrium found at:\")\nprint(f\"  - Equilibrium Quantity (Q_E): {Q_E:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  - Equilibrium Price (P_E):    {P_E:.4f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)\n# CS = Integral from 0 to Q_E of (Demand(Q) - P_E) dQ\ncs_integrand = lambda q: demand_p(q) - P_E\nconsumer_surplus, cs_error = quad(cs_integrand, 0, Q_E)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)\n# The supply curve is defined for Q > 2^(1/3). This is the lower limit for integration.\nq_min_supply = (2)**(1/3)\n# PS = Integral from q_min_supply to Q_E of (P_E - Supply(Q)) dQ\nps_integrand = lambda q: P_E - supply_p(q)\nproducer_surplus, ps_error = quad(ps_integrand, q_min_supply, Q_E)\n\nprint(f\"Calculating welfare components:\")\nprint(f\"  - Consumer Surplus (CS): {consumer_surplus:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"  - Producer Surplus (PS): {producer_surplus:.4f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Total Welfare\n# Total Welfare (TW) = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\ntotal_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\nprint(\"The final equation for total welfare is:\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = {consumer_surplus:.4f} + {producer_surplus:.4f} = {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\n```\n<<<15.6963>>>"
