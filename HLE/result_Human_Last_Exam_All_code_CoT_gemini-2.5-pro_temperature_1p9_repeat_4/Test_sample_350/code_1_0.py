    This function identifies the two key historical philosophers who influenced
    Wolfhart Pannenberg's theology of cosmic history and contingency.
    
    Analysis:
    1.  The text describes Pannenberg's theology of "cosmic history," moving beyond
        a purely human-centered view. This is a clear engagement with and development
        of Georg Hegel's philosophy of history, which sees history as the unfolding
        of Spirit.
    2.  The text also emphasizes a "contingent concept of time" and an engagement with
        natural science (physics). This points to Friedrich Schelling, a contemporary of Hegel,
        whose 'Naturphilosophie' (philosophy of nature) and later work on freedom and
        contingency provided a crucial resource for theologians looking to move beyond
        Hegel's more deterministic system. Pannenberg drew on Schelling to incorporate
        contingency and the natural world into his historical theology.

    Conclusion:
    The two primary influences are Georg Hegel and Friedrich Schelling. This corresponds
    to option E in the list.
