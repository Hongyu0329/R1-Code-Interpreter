    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Challenge:** The number `10^100` (a 1 followed by 100 zeros) is far too large for standard floating-point arithmetic. We need a specialized library for high-precision calculations.\n2.  **Use Periodicity:** The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The core of the problem is to find the remainder of `10^100` when divided by `π`.\n3.  **Select the Right Tool:** Python's `mpmath` library is designed for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic and is perfect for this task.\n4.  **Set Precision:** To accurately calculate `10^100 mod π`, the precision (number of decimal places) for the calculation must be greater than the number of digits in the integer part of `10^100 / π`, which is about 100. We will set the precision to 110 decimal places to ensure accuracy.\n5.  **Implement the Code:** The script will import `mpmath`, set the desired precision, calculate `tan(10^100)`, and then extract the first three digits following the decimal point from the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef find_tan_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the decimal point of tan(10^100)\n    using high-precision arithmetic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Set the working precision for mpmath.\n    # To compute tan(10^100), we are interested in the value of 10^100 mod pi.\n    # Since 10^100 has 101 digits, we need a precision of at least 100 decimal\n    # places for pi to get an accurate result. We'll set the precision to 110.\n    mpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n    # 2. Define the numbers in the expression tan(10^100).\n    # Using variables helps show that all numbers in the equation are used.\n    base = 10\n    exponent = 100\n    \n    # 3. Represent the large number using mpmath's power function.\n    x = mpmath.power(base, exponent)\n\n    # 4. Calculate the tangent. mpmath handles the argument reduction (x mod pi)\n    # automatically with the set precision.\n    result = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n    # 5. Extract the first three digits after the decimal point.\n    # Convert the result to a string for easy manipulation.\n    result_str = str(result)\n    \n    # Find the index of the decimal point.\n    decimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n    \n    # Slice the string to get the three characters after the decimal point.\n    first_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\n    # 6. Print the final answer, including the numbers from the original expression.\n    print(f\"The value of tan({base}^{exponent}) is approximately {result:.10f}...\")\n    print(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_tan_digits()\n```\n<<<248>>>"
