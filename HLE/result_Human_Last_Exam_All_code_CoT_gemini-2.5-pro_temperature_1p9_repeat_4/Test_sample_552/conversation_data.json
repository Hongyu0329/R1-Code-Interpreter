    "In this task, I will first identify the scientist whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his famous 1905 paper on Brownian motion. After finding the correct person based on historical records, I will write a simple Python script. The script will store the scientist's name and the year of the paper in variables and then use the `print` function to output a sentence that answers your question directly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_einstein_citation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose\n    lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The year of the paper in question.\n    paper_year = 1905\n\n    # The scientist whose \"Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Gastheorie\" (Lectures on Gas Theory)\n    # was cited by Einstein.\n    scientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a clear, formatted sentence.\n    # The number 1905 is explicitly printed as requested by the instructions.\n    print(f\"In his {paper_year} paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of {scientist_name}.\")\n\nsolve_einstein_citation()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
