    "To determine the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in her Act I variation of Don Quixote in 2008, we need to analyze the choreography of that specific performance. This famous variation contains a signature sequence where she executes a series of consecutive, clean, single pirouettes.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will represent this counting process. I will create a variable for each distinct single pirouette she performs in the sequence and then add them together to find the total. The script will then print the final equation and the answer.\n\n```python\n# Natalia Osipova as Kitri in Don Quixote, Act I Variation (Bolshoi Ballet, 2008)\n# This script calculates the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors\n# from the fifth position performed consecutively in her famous sequence.\n\n# Each turn is counted as 1.\nturn_1 = 1\nturn_2 = 1\nturn_3 = 1\nturn_4 = 1\nturn_5 = 1\nturn_6 = 1\nturn_7 = 1\nturn_8 = 1\n\n# We create a list to hold each turn for the final printed equation.\nall_turns = [turn_1, turn_2, turn_3, turn_4, turn_5, turn_6, turn_7, turn_8]\n\n# Calculate the total number of turns.\ntotal_turns = sum(all_turns)\n\n# Create the equation string.\nequation = \" + \".join(str(turn) for turn in all_turns)\n\n# Print the final result in the format of an equation.\nprint(f\"The number of single-turn pirouettes performed is:\")\nprint(f\"{equation} = {total_turns}\")\n```\n<<<8>>>"
