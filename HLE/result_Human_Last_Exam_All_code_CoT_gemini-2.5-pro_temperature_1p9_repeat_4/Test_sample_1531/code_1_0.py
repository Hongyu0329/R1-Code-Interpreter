Step 1: Analyze the first line: '{}'
A natural reading places stress on three syllables: '& ALL the STARS are PALaces'.
This creates a three-beat line.

Step 2: Analyze the second line: '{}'
This line also has three clear stresses: 'the WORLD a HOLLOW ROAD'.
This is also a three-beat line.

Step 3: Conclusion
A poetic line with three metrical feet is called a 'trimeter'.
Therefore, this is the most accurate description of the form.
