Here is the step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations:

**Reaction 1: Elimination to form Product A**

The starting material is [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, more systematically named (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane. This compound is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically bulky base. These conditions favor an E2 elimination reaction. Due to the steric hindrance of the base, it preferentially removes a proton from the least sterically hindered β-carbon. In (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(Br)-CH3), the β-protons are on C2 and C4. The protons on the C4 methyl group are primary and more accessible than the secondary protons on C2. This leads to the formation of the Hofmann product, which is the less substituted alkene.

- **Starting Material:** (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane
- **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK)
- **Product A:** 4-phenylbut-1-ene (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2)

The chiral center at C3 is destroyed in this step, making product A an achiral molecule.

**Reaction 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation to form Product B**

Product A, 4-phenylbut-1-ene, is treated with borane in THF (BH3/THF) and then oxidized with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which results in the anti-Markovnikov hydration of the alkene. The borane adds to the terminal carbon of the double bond (C1 of the butene moiety), and the subsequent oxidation step replaces it with a hydroxyl group (-OH).

- **Starting Material (A):** 4-phenylbut-1-ene
- **Reagents:** 1. BH3/THF, 2. H2O2, NaOH
- **Product B:** 4-phenylbutan-1-ol (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH)

Product B is a primary alcohol and is achiral.

**Reaction 3: Bromination to form Product C**

Product B, 4-phenylbutan-1-ol, is reacted with phosphorus tribromide (PBr3). This is a classic method for converting a primary alcohol into a primary alkyl bromide via a substitution reaction (SN2 mechanism). The hydroxyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.

- **Starting Material (B):** 4-phenylbutan-1-ol
- **Reagent:** PBr3
- **Product C:** 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph)

**Identity of the Final Product, C**

The final product, C, is identified as follows:

- **IUPAC Name:** 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane

- **Chirality:** The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is an **achiral** molecule. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically requires the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). In 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, no carbon atom is a stereocenter as each carbon atom in the butane chain is bonded to at least two identical hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the molecule possesses internal planes of symmetry and is not chiral. The original chirality of the starting material was lost in the first reaction step.

The numbers in the final IUPAC name are:
