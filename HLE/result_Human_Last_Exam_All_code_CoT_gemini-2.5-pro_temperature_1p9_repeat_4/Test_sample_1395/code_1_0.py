# Step 1: Define the chromatic number of the Asian graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# The graph of sovereign Asian nations before 1991 was a complex planar graph.
# According to the Four Color Theorem, the chromatic number of any planar graph is at most 4.
# Due to its complexity, the Asian continental graph required 4 colors.
chi_before = 4
print(f"Let chi_before be the chromatic number of the Asian graph before the Soviet dissolution. We have chi_before = {chi_before}.")

# Step 2: Define the chromatic number after the Soviet dissolution.
# The dissolution created several new countries in Asia, such as Kazakhstan.
# After this change, a new geopolitical formation occurred where four countries—China, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia—all share borders with each other.
# This forms a K4 clique, which requires 4 colors. Thus, the new chromatic number is 4.
chi_after = 4
print(f"Let chi_after be the chromatic number after the dissolution. We have chi_after = {chi_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the change in the chromatic number.
# The change is the difference between the chromatic number after and before the event.
delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
print(f"The change, delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before = {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine beta based on the change in planarity.
# A graph of contiguous political countries on a map is planar by definition.
# The dissolution only redrew boundaries on the map, so the graph remained planar.
# Since the planarity did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, therefore beta = {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
# The final result is the product of beta and delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
