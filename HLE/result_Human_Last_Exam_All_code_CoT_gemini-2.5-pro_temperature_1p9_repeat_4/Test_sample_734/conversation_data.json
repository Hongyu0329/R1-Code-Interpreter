    "The Christian theologian who first developed a sophisticated framework and terminology to explain how events like the virgin birth could occur and how the laws of nature themselves might have been altered by the Fall is **Augustine of Hippo** (354â€“430 AD).\n\nAugustine did not see miracles as violations of the natural order established by God. Instead, he argued that God, in the act of creation, embedded latent potentialities or \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*) within nature. These are hidden causalities that can bring about events which seem extraordinary to us but are, in fact, part of God's larger, original plan for creation.\n\n*   **For the virgin birth:** Augustine would argue that the potential for a human to be conceived without a human father was one of these \"seminal reasons\" placed within creation, to be actualized at the chosen moment of Christ's incarnation. It was not against nature as a whole, but against the *known course* of nature.\n*   **For the Fall:** Augustine believed that the Fall of Man had profound consequences for the natural world itself. He interpreted biblical passages (like Genesis 3:17-18, \"Cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it... Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you\") to mean that the harmonious functioning of nature was disrupted. This constitutes an alteration in the state of natural laws as they relate to humanity, a shift from a benign to a more hostile order.\n\nThis framework allowed Augustine to maintain God's sovereignty over a consistent natural order while simultaneously affirming the reality of unique divine acts (miracles) and systemic historical changes (the effects of the Fall).\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
