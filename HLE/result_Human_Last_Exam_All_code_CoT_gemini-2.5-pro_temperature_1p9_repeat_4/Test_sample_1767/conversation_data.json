    "The Chern number is a topological invariant, and for weakly coupled or joined systems, it is an additive quantity. When two Chern insulators are brought together to form a junction with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1.\n\n*   Chern number of the first insulator, C₁ = 1\n*   Chern number of the second insulator, C₂ = 1\n\nThe total Chern number of the junction, C_total, is C₁ + C₂.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum and displays the equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number is an additive quantity.\n# The total Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the final equation showing all the numbers involved\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers:\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
