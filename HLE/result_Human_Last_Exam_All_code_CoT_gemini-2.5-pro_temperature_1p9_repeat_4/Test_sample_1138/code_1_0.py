    This premise is confusing because standard ECDSA is designed to be existentially *unforgeable* under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA), which is a core security goal. A scheme that is 'existentially forgeable' is insecure.

    We will proceed with the most likely interpretation: the question is about the class of digital signature schemes for which 'existential forgery' is the defined threat model we design defenses for. We will analyze the properties of a secure scheme like standard ECDSA within this context.
