    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we will analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Symmetry:** The core of the molecule is a 1,3,5,2,4,6-hexasubstituted benzene ring. The substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are identical large arms, and the substituents at 2, 4, and 6 are identical methyl groups. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry.\n2.  **Simplify the Problem:** Due to the C3 symmetry, the three large arms are chemically equivalent to each other, and the three methyl groups on the central ring are also equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of chemically distinct protons in a single repeating unit, which consists of one of the large arms and one of the methyl groups on the central ring.\n3.  **Count Signals in the Repeating Unit:** We will systematically count the number of non-equivalent proton environments within one arm and the associated central methyl group. The chirality of the arm will be a key factor, as it makes many protons, which might otherwise be equivalent, distinct (diastereotopic).\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this step-by-step analysis and calculates the total number of signals.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_signals():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the structure of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    to determine the number of expected 1H NMR signals based on its symmetry and chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing molecular symmetry.\")\n    print(\"The molecule possesses a C3 rotational axis.
