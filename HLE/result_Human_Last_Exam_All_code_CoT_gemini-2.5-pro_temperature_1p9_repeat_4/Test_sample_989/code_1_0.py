    """

    # Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support
    # vectors from only one class.
    # Analysis A: TRUE. This is a consequence of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
    # conditions in the SVM dual formulation. One key constraint is that the sum of the
    # products of Lagrange multipliers (alpha_i) and class labels (y_i) must be zero:
    # sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0. Support vectors are points with alpha_i > 0.
    # If all support vectors belonged to one class (e.g., y_i = +1 for all alpha_i > 0),
    # the sum would be strictly positive, violating the constraint. Thus, support vectors
    # must come from more than one class.

    # Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be
    # optimal for SVM.
    # Analysis B: TRUE. Standard SVMs can be biased towards the majority class.
    # Cost-sensitive SVMs address this by introducing different penalty parameters (C)
    # for each class. Assigning a higher penalty to misclassifications of the minority
    # class causes the decision boundary to be pushed further away from those points,
    # effectively creating an optimal but unequal margin.

    # Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally
    # tractable for some kernels.
    # Analysis C: TRUE. This is the main benefit of the "kernel trick". For instance,
    # the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel corresponds to a mapping to an
    # infinite-dimensional feature space. However, SVM calculations only require the dot
    # product in that space, which is computed easily by the kernel function itself,
    # avoiding any explicit, intractable computations in the infinite-dimensional space.

    # Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision
    # boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.
    # Analysis D: TRUE. The SVM decision boundary is defined only by the support vectors
    # (points on or within the margin). Data points that are correctly classified and are
    # outside the margin are "interior points" and have Lagrange multipliers (alpha_i)
    # of zero. Since they do not contribute to the weight vector `w` or the bias `b`
    # that define the boundary, their position can be changed (as long as they don't cross
    # the margin) without any effect on the final hyperplane.

    # Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.
    # Analysis E: FALSE. This is a general mathematical statement, not limited to SVMs,
    # and it is not universally true. A strictly convex function is not guaranteed to
    # possess a minimizer. For a simple counterexample, the function f(x) = e^x is
    # strictly convex on the entire real line, but its value always decreases as x
    # approaches negative infinity. It approaches an infimum of 0 but never reaches it, so
    # it has no global minimum. Therefore, the statement is false.
