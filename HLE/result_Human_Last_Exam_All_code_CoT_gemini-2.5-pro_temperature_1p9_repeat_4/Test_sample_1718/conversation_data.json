    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Dimensionality and Coordinates:**\nA Kähler manifold is a special type of complex manifold. Its real dimension, let's call it `n`, must be an even number. It is more natural to work with its complex dimension, `m`, where `n = 2m`. We use complex coordinates $(z^1, ..., z^m)$.\n\n**2. Riemann Tensor Simplification:**\nOn a general `n`-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Riemann tensor has $\\frac{n^2(n^2-1)}{12}$ independent components. However, for a Kähler manifold, the compatible complex structure imposes additional symmetries. A major simplification is that the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor are of the form $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$, where indices with a bar are anti-holomorphic and indices without a bar are holomorphic. Here, $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$ each run from 1 to `m`.\n\n**3. Symmetries of the Non-zero Components:**\nThese components, $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$, are not all independent. They obey several key symmetries:\n*   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}}$ (Symmetry in the two holomorphic indices, $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$)\n*   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}}$ (Symmetry in the two anti-holomorphic indices, $\\bar{\\beta}$ and $\\bar{\\delta}$)\n*   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = \\overline{R_{\\beta\\bar{\\alpha}\\delta\\bar{\\gamma}}}$ (A reality condition relating the tensor to its complex conjugate)\n\n**4. Counting the Components:**\nDue to the symmetries in the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic indices, the tensor's information is captured by how it acts on symmetric pairs of indices.\n*   The number of distinct symmetric pairs of holomorphic indices, $(\\alpha, \\gamma)$, is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `m` with replacement, which is $\\binom{m+1}{2} = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$. Let's call this number `d`.\n*   Similarly, the number of distinct symmetric pairs of anti-holomorphic indices is also `d`.\n*   The symmetries allow us to view the components of the Riemann tensor as entries of a `d x d` Hermitian matrix.\n*   The number of independent real numbers needed to specify a `d x d` Hermitian matrix is `d^2`.\n\n**5. The Final Formula:**\nSubstituting `d = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}`, the total number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is:\nNumber of components = $d^2 = \\left(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\right)^2$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this number for a user-specified complex dimension `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_riemann_components_kahler():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        m_input = input(\"Enter the complex dimension of the Kähler manifold (m): \")\n        m = int(m_input)\n\n        if m <= 0:\n            print(\"Error: The complex dimension must be a positive integer.\")\n            return\n\n        # On a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m, the independent components\n        # of the Riemann tensor correspond to the entries of a d x d Hermitian matrix,\n        # where d = m(m+1)/2.\n        # The number of independent real components in such a matrix is d^2.\n\n        # Formula: N = ( (m * (m + 1)) / 2 )^2\n\n        d = (m * (m + 1)) // 2\n        num_components = d ** 2\n\n        print(f\"\\nFor a Kähler manifold with complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n        print(\"The formula for the number of independent components is (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2.\")\n        print(f\"First, we calculate d = m * (m + 1) / 2:\")\n        print(f\"d = ({m} * ({m} + 1)) / 2 = {d}\")\n        print(f\"Then, the number of components is d^2:\")\n        print(f\"Result = {d}^2 = {num_components}\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input.
