    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the equilibrium points of the given system of differential equations by setting both derivatives, $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$, to zero.\n2.  Then, I will analyze the stability of these equilibrium points by calculating the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluating its eigenvalues at each point. This will allow me to identify any saddle points.\n3.  A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different behaviors. Often, these are the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points. I will look for a separatrix that connects the saddle point to another equilibrium point.\n4.  I will hypothesize a polynomial form for this separatrix, $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$. I'll use the coordinates of the connected equilibrium points to determine some of the coefficients.\n5.  To find the remaining coefficient(s), I will use the fact that the separatrix must be a solution to the phase trajectory equation, $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$. By substituting the polynomial form into this equation and comparing coefficients, I can solve for the unknown parameters.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script that explains these steps in the comments and prints out the final equation of the separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the steps to find the separatrix for the given system of ODEs and prints the result.\n    The system is:\n    d'(t) = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    u'(t) = u**2*(u-1)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Find equilibrium points.\n    # We set u'(t) = 0, which gives u^2(u-1) = 0, so u=0 or u=1.\n    \n    # If u=0, we set d'(t) = 0:\n    # 2*d**2 + 0*d - 0 = 0  => 2*d**2 = 0 => d=0.\n    # Equilibrium point: (0, 0).\n    \n    # If u=1, we set d'(t) = 0:\n    # 2*d**2 + (-3+5)*d - 0 = 0 => 2*d**2 + 2*d = 0 => 2d(d+1)=0 => d=0 or d=-1.\n    # Equilibrium points: (1, 0) and (1, -1).\n\n    print(\"The equilibrium points are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze stability (determine the saddle point).\n    # The Jacobian matrix J(u,d) is:\n    # J = [[3*u**2 - 2*u, 0],\n    #      [(-3 + 10*u)*d - 3*u**2 + 4*u**3, 4*d - 3*u + 5*u**2]]\n    \n    # At (1, -1):\n    # J(1,-1) = [[1, 0], [-6, -2]]\n    # The eigenvalues are 1 and -2.
