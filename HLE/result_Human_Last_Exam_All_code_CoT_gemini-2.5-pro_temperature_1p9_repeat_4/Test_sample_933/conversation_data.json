    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the coldest efficient temperature for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) synthesis, followed by the Python code to present the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Chemical Reaction:** The task is to find the optimal synthesis temperature for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4). This is a well-documented reaction in inorganic chemistry: the direct combination of Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂) gas.\n2.  **Consult Chemical Principles:** The reaction's outcome depends heavily on the conditions. The specific product (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆) is controlled by the ratio of reactants, pressure, and temperature.\n3.  **Identify Efficient Conditions for XeF4:** According to chemical literature, the standard method for producing XeF₄ efficiently involves heating a 1:5 mixture of Xe and F₂ to **400 °C**. While the reaction can occur at lower temperatures, the rate becomes impractically slow, making it \"inefficient\". At much higher temperatures, the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) is favored. Therefore, 400 °C is the established coldest temperature for *efficient* thermal synthesis.\n4.  **Develop a Python Script:** I will create a Python script that programmatically represents this knowledge. The script will:\n    *   State the known efficient temperature for XeF₄ synthesis.\n    *   Provide the chemical reasoning behind this temperature choice.\n    *   Compare this value to the provided multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n    *   As requested, it will also print out the numbers involved in the final chemical equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_xenon_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the optimal synthesis temperature for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known data from chemical literature for the synthesis of Xenon Fluorides.\n    # The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) from its elements is an established process.\n    # Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) -> XeF₄(s)\n    \n    target_compound = \"Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\"\n    efficient_temp_C = 400  # The standard temperature in Celsius for efficient synthesis.\n    \n    print(\"### Analysis of Xenon Tetrafluoride Synthesis ###\")\n    \n    reasoning = (\n        f\"1.
