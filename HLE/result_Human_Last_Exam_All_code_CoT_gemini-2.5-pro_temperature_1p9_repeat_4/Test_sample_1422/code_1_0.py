    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram.

    This function uses topological rules for Feynman diagrams to derive the answer.

    I: number of internal lines (propagators)
    V: number of vertices
    n: number of fields/lines meeting at each vertex (e.g., n=3 for phi^3, n=4 for phi^4)
