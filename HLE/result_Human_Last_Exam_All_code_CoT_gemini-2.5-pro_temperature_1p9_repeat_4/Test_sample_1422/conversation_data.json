    "To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological relations for Feynman diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will start with the fundamental formula that relates the number of loops (L) in a diagram to its number of internal lines (I) and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`.\n2.  Next, I will use a second formula that relates the properties of the vertices to the lines. For a theory with `n` fields interacting at each vertex (e.g., n=4 for a φ⁴ theory), and for a vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external lines, which is sufficient to find the minimum), the relationship is `n * V = 2 * I`.\n3.  I will combine these two equations to express the number of vertices (V) as a function of the number of loops (L) and the type of interaction (n).\n4.  I will then set the number of loops L to 2, as requested by the problem.\n5.  Finally, I will calculate V for the simplest possible interacting theories (n=3 and n=4) to find the absolute minimum number of vertices required. The code will print out each step of this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram.\n\n    This function uses topological rules for Feynman diagrams to derive the answer.\n    L: number of loops\n    I: number of internal lines (propagators)\n    V: number of vertices\n    n: number of fields/lines meeting at each vertex (e.g., n=3 for phi^3, n=4 for phi^4)\n\n    The relationships are:\n    1) L = I - V + 1\n    2) n * V = 2 * I  (for vacuum diagrams, i.e., no external lines)\n\n    We solve these for V in terms of L and n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We want a two-loop diagram\n    L = 2\n    \n    print(\"Goal: Find the minimum number of vertices (V) for a two-loop (L=2) Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"We use two topological formulas for a diagram with V vertices and I internal lines:\")\n    print(\"1.
