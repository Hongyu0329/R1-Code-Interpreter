    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of these tori.\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive groups states that this number is equal to the number of so-called $F$-conjugacy classes in the corresponding Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Weyl group is $W(E_8)$. The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is \"split\", which in turn means that the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nWhen $F$ acts trivially, the $F$-conjugacy classes are identical to the ordinary conjugacy classes of the group $W(E_8)$. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThis is a classic result in computational group theory. The number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ is 112. This number can be obtained by classifying the elements of the group by their order and then counting the number of conjugacy classes for each order. The following script demonstrates this by summing up these counts to arrive at the total.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e8_tori():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type E8.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E_8).\n    The calculation is based on the known classification of conjugacy classes by element order.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data from the classification of conjugacy classes in W(E_8) by R.W.
