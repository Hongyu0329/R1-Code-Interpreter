    # Finding 1: No polypectomy was performed.
    print("Fact 1: The case states, 'No polypectomy was performed during the procedure.'")
    print("   - Reasoning: Postpolypectomy syndrome is a complication of polypectomy.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This directly rules out choice D, 'Postpolypectomy syndrome'.\n")

    # Finding 2: Specific pain location.
    print("Fact 2: The patient experienced 'upper abdominal pain and left-shoulder discomfort.'")
    print("   - Reasoning: Pain referred to the left shoulder (Kehr's sign) is a classic sign of diaphragmatic irritation from blood in the abdomen, which strongly suggests injury to the spleen located in the left upper quadrant (LUQ).")
    print("   - Conclusion: This finding is highly specific for choice C, 'Splenic laceration'.\n")

    # Finding 3: Signs of severe blood loss.
    print("Fact 3: The patient developed 'tachycardia and hypotension' and the 'hemoglobin level had decreased to 6.5 g/dL' from an initial 11.7 g/dL.")
    print("   - Reasoning: This indicates a massive and acute hemorrhage, leading to hemorrhagic shock.")
    print("   - Conclusion: While any of the bleeding complications (A, B, C) can cause a drop in hemoglobin, this profound and rapid deterioration is the classic presentation for a solid organ injury like a splenic laceration, which can bleed profusely into the abdomen.\n")

    # Finding 4: Comparison with other options.
    print("Comparative Analysis:")
    print("   - A. Colonic perforation: Possible, but less likely to present with both Kehr's sign and such severe, rapid hemorrhage.")
    print("   - B. Lower GI bleeding: Unlikely, as it typically presents with rectal bleeding and does not explain the specific LUQ and referred shoulder pain.")
    print("   - C. Splenic laceration: All key features—the mechanism (difficult colonoscopy near the splenic flexure), LUQ pain, Kehr's sign, and massive hemoperitoneum leading to shock—are perfectly explained by this diagnosis.\n")

    print("Final Conclusion: The combination of key findings most strongly supports 'Splenic laceration'.")
