    "This problem requires an understanding of a specific historical sound change in English called Trisyllabic Laxing (or Trisyllabic Shortening).\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing:** This rule states that a long vowel becomes short if it's in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. This often happens when a suffix is added to a base word. For example, `sane` (/eɪ/, long 'a') becomes `sanity` (/æ/, short 'a').\n2.  **Analyze each word:** I will examine each word on the list to see if it fits this pattern. I'll look at its base word (if any), its number of syllables, and the vowel sound in question.\n    *   **southern:** Derived from `south` (/aʊ/). The vowel changes to /ʌ/ (a short vowel). However, `southern` only has two syllables (south-ern). So, this isn't *trisyllabic* laxing.\n    *   **derivative:** Derived from `derive` (/aɪ/, a long diphthong). The word `derivative` (de-riv-a-tive) has four syllables. The original long vowel is now in the third-to-last syllable and has been shortened to /ɪ/. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **serenity:** Derived from `serene` (/iː/, a long 'e'). In `serenity` (se-ren-i-ty), the vowel is in the third-to-last syllable and shortens to /ɛ/. This is also a classic example.\n    *   **pleasant:** Derived from `please` (/iː/, a long 'e'). The vowel shortens to /ɛ/ in `pleasant` (pleas-ant). But, like `southern`, the word only has two syllables.\n    *   **gratitude:** Related to `grateful` (/eɪ/, a long 'a'). In `gratitude` (grat-i-tude), a three-syllable word, the vowel is in the first (and third-from-last) syllable and is a short /æ/. This is another example of the rule applying.\n    *   **shadow:** This word comes from Old English `sceadwe`, where the first vowel (`æ`) was already short. The word has two syllables (shad-ow). It is not trisyllabic, and its vowel was never long to begin with, so it could not have been shortened by this rule.\n3.  **Conclusion:** `Derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` all show clear signs of trisyllabic laxing. `Southern` and `pleasant` show vowel shortening, but in disyllabic (two-syllable) words, so it isn't technically *trisyllabic* laxing. `Shadow` is the most distinct outlier because it is disyllabic AND its root vowel was never long. Therefore, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n```python\ndef find_word_without_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to find the one that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n    Trisyllabic Laxing is a sound change rule where a long vowel becomes short when it is\n    in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable of a word.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = {\n        \"southern\": \"From 'south' (/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/).
