    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**: The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong and sterically bulky base. This combination strongly indicates an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Understand the E2 Mechanism on a Cyclohexane Ring**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. It proceeds via a concerted mechanism where the leaving group (in this case, Br) and a proton on an adjacent carbon must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** orientation (one group axial-up, the other axial-down).\n\n3.  **Examine the Conformations of the Starting Material**:\n    *   (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *trans* isomer. This means the bromo and methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring.\n    *   It exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n        *   **Conformer A (more stable)**: The bulky bromo and methyl groups occupy equatorial positions.\n        *   **Conformer B (less stable)**: The bromo and methyl groups occupy axial positions.\n    *   The E2 reaction can **only** proceed from Conformer B, because only in this conformation is the leaving group (Br) in the required axial position. Although this conformer is less populated at equilibrium, the reaction will pull the equilibrium towards it as the product is formed.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways from the Reactive Conformer (Conformer B)**:\n    *   In Conformer B, let's assume the bromine at C1 is **axial up**. This means the methyl group at C2 is **axial down**.\n    *   We now look for adjacent protons that are **axial down**.\n    *   **Path 1 (towards C2)**: To form the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene), a proton must be removed from C2. However, since the methyl group at C2 is axial down, the proton at C2 is **equatorial**. It is *not* trans-diaxial to the bromine. Therefore, elimination to form 1-methylcyclohexene is **impossible**.\n    *   **Path 2 (towards C6)**: To form the less substituted Hofmann-like product (3-methylcyclohexene), a proton must be removed from C6. Carbon C6 has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial proton** at C6 is oriented down, making it perfectly trans-diaxial to the axial-up bromine at C1.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   Due to the strict stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction, the base can only abstract the axial proton from C6.\n    *   This leads exclusively to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group at C2 remains.\n    *   The final product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"potassium tert-butoxide\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 Elimination\"\n\n    print(f\"Starting analysis for the reaction of {reactant} with {reagent}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Identify the reaction type.\")\n    print(f\"The reagent, {reagent}, is a strong, sterically bulky base.
