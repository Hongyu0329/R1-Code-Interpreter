    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Quantity**: First, I will identify the name of the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function as it's known in the nuclear criticality and reactor physics community. This function is fundamental to reactor noise analysis.\n2.  **Provide the Mathematical Model**: I will present a simplified but common mathematical model for this quantity based on one-speed neutron diffusion theory. This will provide a concrete formula to work with. The formula will be of the form `S(k, ω)`, where `k` is the wave number (Fourier conjugate of space) and `ω` is the angular frequency (Fourier conjugate of time).\n3.  **Develop Python Code**: I will write a Python script that implements this formula. The script will:\n    *   Define typical physical constants for a nuclear system (like neutron speed, diffusion coefficient, and macroscopic cross-sections).\n    *   Create a function that calculates the value of this quantity for given `k` and `ω` inputs.\n    *   Calculate and print a specific example, clearly showing the inputs and the result.\n\nThe physical quantity you're asking about is the **Neutron Power Spectral Density (NPSD)**. It describes how the \"power\" (or variance) of the fluctuations in the neutron population is distributed across different frequencies and spatial modes.\n\nFor a simplified one-speed diffusion model without delayed neutrons, the NPSD, `S(k, ω)`, can be expressed as:\n\n`S(k, ω) = A / (α(k)² + ω²)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `A` is a constant related to the strength of the stochastic noise source in the system.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency.\n*   `k` is the wave number.\n*   `α(k)` is the k-dependent prompt neutron decay constant (Rossi-alpha), given by: `α(k) = v * (Σₐ + D*k² - νΣf)`\n    *   `v`: neutron speed\n    *   `D`: diffusion coefficient\n    *   `Σₐ`: macroscopic absorption cross-section\n    *   `νΣf`: macroscopic neutron production cross-section\n\nThe following Python code calculates the NPSD based on this model.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_npsd(k, omega, params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Neutron Power Spectral Density (NPSD) using a one-speed\n    diffusion model without delayed neutrons.\n\n    Args:\n        k (float): Wave number (in cm^-1).\n        omega (float): Angular frequency (in rad/s).\n        params (dict): A dictionary containing physical parameters of the system.\n            'v': neutron speed (cm/s)\n            'D': diffusion coefficient (cm)\n            'Sigma_a': macroscopic absorption cross-section (cm^-1)\n            'nuSigma_f': macroscopic neutron production cross-section (cm^-1)\n            'A': noise source strength constant (arbitrary units)\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The value of the NPSD S(k, omega).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unpack parameters\n    v = params['v']\n    D = params['D']\n    Sigma_a = params['Sigma_a']\n    nuSigma_f = params['nuSigma_f']\n    A = params['A']\n\n    # Calculate the k-dependent prompt neutron decay constant (Rossi-alpha)\n    # alpha(k) = v * (Sigma_a + D*k^2 - nuSigma_f)\n    alpha_k = v * (Sigma_a + D * k**2 - nuSigma_f)\n\n    # Calculate the NPSD\n    # S(k, omega) = A / (alpha(k)^2 + omega^2)\n    # Adding a small epsilon to the denominator to avoid division by zero\n    # in a perfectly critical system (alpha_k=0) at zero frequency (omega=0).\n    epsilon = 1e-12\n    npsd_value = A / (alpha_k**2 + omega**2 + epsilon)\n    \n    return npsd_value, alpha_k\n\n# --- Main execution ---\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define physical parameters for a hypothetical slightly subcritical thermal system\n    # (Values are for illustrative purposes)\n    physical_parameters = {\n        'v': 2.2e5,        # Thermal neutron speed (cm/s)\n        'D': 0.8,          # Diffusion coefficient (cm)\n        'Sigma_a': 0.02,   # Absorption cross-section (cm^-1)\n        'nuSigma_f': 0.0199,# Production cross-section, making it slightly subcritical (cm^-1)\n        'A': 1000.0        # Arbitrary source strength\n    }\n\n    # Input values for the calculation\n    input_k = 0.1      # Example wave number in cm^-1\n    input_omega = 1000.0 # Example angular frequency in rad/s\n\n    # Calculate the NPSD\n    S_k_omega, alpha_k_val = calculate_npsd(input_k, input_omega, physical_parameters)\n\n    # Print the results in a clear format\n    print(\"--- Nuclear Power Spectral Density Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Given Parameters:\")\n    for key, value in physical_parameters.items():\n        print(f\"  {key}: {value}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation for:\")\n    print(f\"  Wave Number (k)      = {input_k} cm^-1\")\n    print(f\"  Angular Frequency (ω) = {input_omega} rad/s\")\n    print(\"\\nIntermediate Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"  k-dependent decay constant α(k) = {alpha_k_val:.2f} s^-1\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Result ---\")\n    print(\"The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is the Neutron Power Spectral Density, S(k, ω).\")\n    print(f\"Its calculated value is:\")\n    print(f\"S(k={input_k}, ω={input_omega}) = {S_k_omega:.6e}\")\n```\n<<<Neutron Power Spectral Density>>>"
