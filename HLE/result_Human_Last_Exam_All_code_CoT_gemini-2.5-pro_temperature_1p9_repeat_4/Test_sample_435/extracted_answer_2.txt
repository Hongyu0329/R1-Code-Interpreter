Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, persistence, and effector function, interleukin-15 would be predicted to **increase cytokine release** from CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. The resulting cells are more functionally potent, leading to a more robust release of key effector cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α.
