# Step 1: Analyze the user's question.
# The user is asking for the NCCN-recommended treatment for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after the first-line therapy (trastuzumab and a taxane) has failed. This is known as the "second-line" setting.

# Step 2: Search the provided text for information on treatment guidelines.
# The text has a specific paragraph summarizing the current NCCN guidelines. This is the most reliable information to use.

# Step 3: Extract the recommended treatment sequence from the NCCN summary paragraph.
# The text states: "Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines with category 1 evidence recommend THP [a regimen containing trastuzumab and a taxane] as the preferred first-line regimen for HER2+ MBC."
# For the next step, the text says: "Upon disease progression, TDXd is recommended in the second-line setting."
# TDXd is the abbreviation for fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan.

# Step 4: Compare this information with the given answer choices.
# A. Tucatinib, trastuzumab, and capecitabine: The text identifies this as a preferred *third-line* therapy.
# B. Trastuzumab emtansine: The text states this agent was "replaced" by TDXd as the second-line therapy.
# C. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan: The text explicitly names this as the recommended agent for the second-line setting, which is the scenario in the question.
# D. Chemotherapy: This is too general and not the specific agent recommended.
# E. None of the above: Option C is directly supported by the text.

# Step 5: Conclude the most accurate answer.
# Based on the direct statement from the text's summary of NCCN guidelines, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan is the recommended treatment.
