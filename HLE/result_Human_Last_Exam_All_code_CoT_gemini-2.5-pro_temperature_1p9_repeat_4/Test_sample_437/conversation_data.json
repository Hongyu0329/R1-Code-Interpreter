    "Of course, I can help with that. The task is to evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ where $\\phi$ is a $1s$ Slater-type orbital (STO). This integral represents the expectation value of the potential energy operator $\\frac{1}{r}$ for an electron in a $1s$ orbital. In this case, we assume we are evaluating the integral for a single orbital centered at the origin, so $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi_{1s}$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Define the 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO)**: The mathematical form of a 1s STO is $\\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) = N e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ is the orbital exponent and $N$ is the normalization constant.\n2.  **Normalize the Orbital**: I will first find the value of $N$ by solving the normalization condition $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle = \\int |\\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 d\\mathbf{r} = 1$. The integration is performed over all space using spherical coordinates.\n3.  **Set up the Integral**: The integral to be evaluated is $\\int \\phi_{1s}^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$. Since the STO is real, this simplifies to $\\int \\phi_{1s}^2(\\mathbf{r}) \\frac{1}{r} d\\mathbf{r}$.\n4.  **Solve with Python**: I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic integration required for both the normalization and the final evaluation. The code will display each step of the calculation and print the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef evaluate_1s_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function evaluates the integral <phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s> for a \n    1s Slater-type orbital using symbolic mathematics with the sympy library.\n    It demonstrates the process step-by-step, from normalization to the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the necessary symbolic variables for spherical coordinates (r, theta, phi)\n    # and the orbital exponent (zeta).\n    r, theta, phi = sp.symbols('r theta phi', real=True, positive=True)\n    zeta = sp.symbols('zeta', real=True, positive=True)\n\n    # Use the infinity symbol from sympy for integration limits.\n    oo = sp.oo\n\n    # Step 1: Define the unnormalized 1s Slater-type orbital (STO).\n    # The functional form is an exponential decay.\n    phi_1s_unnormalized = sp.exp(-zeta * r)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The unnormalized 1s Slater-type orbital (STO) is:\")\n    print(f\"    \\u03C6_unnormalized(r) = {phi_1s_unnormalized}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the normalization constant, N.\n    # The normalization condition is Integral(|N * phi|^2 dV) = 1 over all space.\n    # The volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = r^2 * sin(theta) * dr * dtheta * dphi.\n    integrand_for_norm = phi_1s_unnormalized**2 * r**2 * sp.sin(theta)\n    \n    # We solve the integral of |phi_unnormalized|^2 dV.\n    norm_integral_val = sp.integrate(integrand_for_norm, (phi, 0, 2*sp.pi), (theta, 0, sp.pi), (r, 0, oo))\n\n    # N is the reciprocal of the square root of this integral.\n    N = sp.sqrt(1 / norm_integral_val)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the normalization constant N.\")\n    print(f\"    The integral of |\\u03C6_unnormalized|^2 over all space evaluates to: {norm_integral_val}\")\n    print(f\"    The normalization constant N is therefore: {N}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Define the normalized 1s STO.\n    phi_1s_normalized = N * phi_1s_unnormalized\n    print(\"Step 3: The normalized 1s STO is:\")\n    print(f\"    \\u03C6_1s(r) = {phi_1s_normalized}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Evaluate the integral <phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s>.\n    # The operator is 1/r.\n    operator = 1 / r\n    \n    # The integrand is |phi_1s|^2 * (1/r) * dV.\n    final_integrand = phi_1s_normalized**2 * operator * r**2 * sp.sin(theta)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Set up the final integral for <\\u03C6_1s| 1/r |\\u03C6_1s>.\")\n    print(f\"    The integrand is |{phi_1s_normalized}|^2 * ({operator}) * r^2 * sin(\\u03B8)\\n\")\n\n    # Perform the final integration over all space.\n    final_result = sp.integrate(final_integrand, (phi, 0, 2*sp.pi), (theta, 0, sp.pi), (r, 0, oo))\n\n    # Step 5: Display the final result.\n    # The final equation is <phi_1s | (1/r) | phi_1s> = result.\n    op_num = 1 # The number in the operator term 1/r\n    \n    print(\"Step 5: The result of the integration is:\")\n    print(f\"    <\\u03C6_1s| ({op_num}/r) |\\u03C6_1s> = {final_result}\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The expectation value of the 1/r operator for a 1s Slater orbital is simply the orbital exponent, zeta.\")\n    print(\"For example, for a hydrogen atom, where \\u03B6 = 1, the value is 1.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    evaluate_1s_integral()\n```\n<<<zeta>>>"
