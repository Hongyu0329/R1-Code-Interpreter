    "Here is my plan to determine the diet of adult Raphidiopterans:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Subject:** The question asks about the feeding habits of adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies.\n2.  **Recall/Research Key Facts:** I will access my knowledge base regarding entomology. The primary diet of both larval and adult snakeflies is predatory. They consume small, soft-bodied arthropods like aphids and mites. However, adults are also known to supplement their diet.\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A. Nectar & B. Pollen:** Adults are often found on flowers and are known to consume nectar and pollen as an energy source to fuel their flight and predatory activities. So, A is plausible. B is too specific to a New Zealand plant (Māhoe), making it a likely distractor, even though pollen in general is a food source.\n    *   **C. Fungus:** This is incorrect. They are not known to be fungivores.\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** This is incorrect. They are predators, not herbivores. Karamū is also a New Zealand native plant.\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** Snakeflies are well-known predators of aphids. While \"Totara\" is a specific tree, \"Aphids\" is the key food item, which is correct.\n4.  **Synthesize the Best Answer:** Based on the analysis, adult snakeflies feed on both aphids (E) and nectar/pollen (A). Therefore, the option that combines both A and E is the most complete and accurate choice.\n5.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script that logically steps through these facts and prints the reasoning before outputting the final conclusion in the specified format.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Known facts about adult Raphidiopteran (snakefly) diet\n    primary_diet = \"predatory on small, soft-bodied insects (e.g., aphids)\"\n    supplementary_diet = \"nectar and pollen\"\n    \n    # Evaluate the choices based on the facts\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the food sources for adult Raphidiopterans.\")\n    print(f\"Fact 1: Adults are predatory. Their main food source is {primary_diet}.\")\n    print(\"This fact supports option E (Totara Aphids), as aphids are a primary food.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(f\"Fact 2: Adults also require energy for flight and hunting, which they get from {supplementary_diet}.\")\n    print(\"This fact supports option A (Nectar).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the combined answer choices.\")\n    print(\"Choice F suggests that both A (Nectar) and E (Aphids) are correct.\")\n    print(\"Since scientific records confirm that adults feed on both small insects like aphids and supplement their diet with nectar, this choice is the most comprehensive.\")\n    print(\"Other options like leaf tissue (D) or fungus (C) are incorrect as snakeflies are not herbivores or fungivores.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    final_answer = \"F\"\n    print(\"Conclusion: The most accurate answer is F, as it includes both their predatory and supplementary food sources.\")\n    \n    # Output the final answer in the required format\n    sys.stdout.write(\"<<<{}>>>\\n\".format(final_answer))\n\nsolve_raphidioptera_diet()\n```"
