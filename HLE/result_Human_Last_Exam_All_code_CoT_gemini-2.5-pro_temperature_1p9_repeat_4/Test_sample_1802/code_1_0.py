# The rank of a quantum channel and its complementary channel are equal.
# So, the problem reduces to finding the maximal rank of a Pauli channel Lambda
# acting on a d-dimensional quantum system.
#
# A Pauli channel is described by Lambda(rho) = sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{i,j} U_{i,j} * rho * (U_{i,j})^dagger,
# where {U_{i,j}} is the set of d^2 generalized Pauli operators.
#
# These d^2 Pauli operators are linearly independent and form a basis for the
# space of d x d matrices. The rank of the channel is the number of
# linearly independent Kraus operators, which equals the number of non-zero
# probability coefficients p_{i,j}.
#
# To maximize the rank, we need the maximum possible number of non-zero
# coefficients. We can choose all d^2 coefficients to be non-zero (e.g., p_{i,j} = 1/d^2),
# which corresponds to a valid channel (the completely depolarizing channel).
#
# Therefore, the maximal number of linearly independent Kraus operators is d^2.

# Calculate the maximal rank
maximal_rank = d ** 2

# Print the result and the final equation.
# The following print statement shows the equation with all the numbers,
# as requested by the prompt.
