    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  First, I will establish the relationship between the rank of a quantum channel and its complementary channel. It's a key theorem in quantum information theory that these two ranks are equal. This simplifies the problem to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself.\n2.  Next, I'll define the Pauli channel for a $d$-dimensional system (a qudit) and its Kraus operators. The rank of a channel is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators.\n3.  The Kraus operators of a Pauli channel are constructed from the generalized Pauli operators, which are known to be a set of $d^2$ linearly independent operators.\n4.  The rank of the Pauli channel is then determined by the number of non-zero probabilities associated with these Pauli operators. To maximize the rank, we need to maximize this number.\n5.  I will show that it is possible to define a valid Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero (for example, the completely depolarizing channel).\n6.  This leads to the conclusion that the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n7.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that takes the dimension `d` of the qudit and calculates this maximal rank, printing the result and the equation used, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation for an example dimension.\n\n```python\n# The dimension `d` of the qudit system.\n# This value can be changed to any integer greater than or equal to 2.\nd = 3\n\n# The rank of a quantum channel and its complementary channel are equal.\n# So, the problem reduces to finding the maximal rank of a Pauli channel Lambda\n# acting on a d-dimensional quantum system.\n#\n# A Pauli channel is described by Lambda(rho) = sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{i,j} U_{i,j} * rho * (U_{i,j})^dagger,\n# where {U_{i,j}} is the set of d^2 generalized Pauli operators.\n#\n# These d^2 Pauli operators are linearly independent and form a basis for the\n# space of d x d matrices. The rank of the channel is the number of\n# linearly independent Kraus operators, which equals the number of non-zero\n# probability coefficients p_{i,j}.\n#\n# To maximize the rank, we need the maximum possible number of non-zero\n# coefficients. We can choose all d^2 coefficients to be non-zero (e.g., p_{i,j} = 1/d^2),\n# which corresponds to a valid channel (the completely depolarizing channel).\n#\n# Therefore, the maximal number of linearly independent Kraus operators is d^2.\n\n# Calculate the maximal rank\nmaximal_rank = d ** 2\n\n# Print the result and the final equation.\n# The following print statement shows the equation with all the numbers,\n# as requested by the prompt.\nprint(f\"For a qudit of dimension d = {d}, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is d^2.\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{d}^2 = {maximal_rank}\")\n\n```\n<<<d^2>>>"
