    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we can use a general theorem from algebraic topology.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the general form of the map**: The given map is an instance of the form $\\alpha: \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$, where $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$.\n2.  **Recall the relevant theorem**: A theorem by M. Arkowitz and C. R. Curjel provides the connectivity for this type of map. It states that if $X$ is a $(p-1)$-connected space and $Y$ is a $(q-1)$-connected space (for $p, q \\ge 2$), then the map $\\alpha$ is $(p+q-1)$-connected. The connectivity of a map is the highest integer $k$ for which the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i = k$.\n3.  **Determine the connectivity of the spaces X and Y**:\n    *   The space $X = S^4$ (the 4-sphere) is $(4-1)=3$-connected. This gives us $p-1 = 3$, so $p=4$.\n    *   The space $Y = S^6$ (the 6-sphere) is $(6-1)=5$-connected. This gives us $q-1 = 5$, so $q=6$.\n4.  **Calculate the connectivity of the map**: Using the formula from the theorem, the connectivity is $p+q-1$.\n5.  **Substitute the values**: We substitute $p=4$ and $q=6$ into the formula to get the final result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the connectivity of the map:\n# f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\n\n# This map is of the general form alpha: Sigma(Omega X wedge Omega Y) -> Omega(X wedge Y)\n# where X = S^4 and Y = S^6.\n\n# According to a theorem by Arkowitz and Curjel, the connectivity of this map\n# is given by the formula (p + q - 1), where X is (p-1)-connected\n# and Y is (q-1)-connected.\n\n# For X = S^4, the sphere of dimension d1 = 4.\n# A d-sphere is (d-1)-connected.\n# So, S^4 is (4-1) = 3-connected.\n# This means p-1 = 3, so p = 4.\nd1 = 4\np = d1\n\n# For Y = S^6, the sphere of dimension d2 = 6.\n# S^6 is (6-1) = 5-connected.\n# This means q-1 = 5, so q = 6.\nd2 = 6\nq = d2\n\n# The connectivity of the map is p + q - 1.\nconnectivity = p + q - 1\n\n# We print the equation and the final answer.\n# The result shows each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The connectivity is given by the formula p + q - 1.\")\nprint(f\"For X=S^4, p = {p}.\")\nprint(f\"For Y=S^6, q = {q}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: {p} + {q} - 1 = {connectivity}\")\nprint(f\"So, the connectivity of the map is {connectivity}.\")\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
