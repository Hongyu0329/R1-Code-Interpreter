# The problem is to find the connectivity of the map:
# f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)

# This map is of the general form alpha: Sigma(Omega X wedge Omega Y) -> Omega(X wedge Y)
# where X = S^4 and Y = S^6.

# According to a theorem by Arkowitz and Curjel, the connectivity of this map
# is given by the formula (p + q - 1), where X is (p-1)-connected
# and Y is (q-1)-connected.

# For X = S^4, the sphere of dimension d1 = 4.
# A d-sphere is (d-1)-connected.
# So, S^4 is (4-1) = 3-connected.
# This means p-1 = 3, so p = 4.
d1 = 4
p = d1

# For Y = S^6, the sphere of dimension d2 = 6.
# S^6 is (6-1) = 5-connected.
# This means q-1 = 5, so q = 6.
d2 = 6
q = d2

# The connectivity of the map is p + q - 1.
connectivity = p + q - 1

# We print the equation and the final answer.
# The result shows each number in the final equation.

print(f"For X=S^4, p = {p}.")
print(f"For Y=S^6, q = {q}.")
print(f"The calculation is: {p} + {q} - 1 = {connectivity}")
print(f"So, the connectivity of the map is {connectivity}.")
