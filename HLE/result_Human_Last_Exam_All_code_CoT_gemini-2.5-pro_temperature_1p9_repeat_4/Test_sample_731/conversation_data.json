    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the semidihedral group and a clear definition of what a \"power subgroup\" is. The term \"power subgroup\" is not standard in group theory literature. The most reasonable interpretation in this context is that it refers to the set of all **cyclic subgroups** of the group. A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element, and every subgroup generated by a power of an element (e.g., $\\langle g^k \\rangle$) is itself a cyclic subgroup. We will proceed by counting all distinct cyclic subgroups of the semidihedral group of order 512.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$. Its structure is given by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    For size 512, we have $n=9$. Thus, the group is $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The group elements consist of two types: powers of $r$ (i.e., $r^i$) and elements of the form $sr^i$.\n\n2.  **Count Cyclic Subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$**:\n    The element $r$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $256$. The number of subgroups in a cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$. For order $256 = 2^8$, there are $8+1=9$ divisors, and thus 9 distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Count Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements of the Form $sr^i$**:\n    We need to determine the order of elements of the form $sr^i$ and how many distinct subgroups they generate.\n    *   **Case 1: $i$ is even.** The elements are of the form $sr^{2k}$. There are $128$ such elements. It can be shown that each of these elements has an order of 2. Each element generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2. This gives us 128 distinct subgroups.\n    *   **Case 2: $i$ is odd.** The elements are of the form $sr^{2k+1}$. There are $128$ such elements. It can be shown that each of these elements has an order of 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators. Therefore, these 128 elements pair up to generate $128 / 2 = 64$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\n4.  **Sum the Counts**:\n    The total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the subgroups from these disjoint sets of generators. We add the counts from steps 2 and 3. The subgroups generated by $sr^i$ are never the same as those in $\\langle r \\rangle$ (except for the trivial subgroup {1}, which is counted in step 2), because they contain elements outside of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle$: 9\n    *   Subgroups from $sr^i$ with even $i$: 128\n    *   Subgroups from $sr^i$ with odd $i$: 64\n    *   Total = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe python code will automate this calculation based on the general formula derived for $SD_{2^n}$: Number of cyclic subgroups = $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_sd(group_order):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of cyclic (\"power\") subgroups in the semidihedral group of a given order.\n    The order must be a power of 2, specifically 2^n for n >= 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    if group_order < 16 or (group_order & (group_order - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"The semidihedral group SD_{group_order} is typically defined for orders 2^n where n >= 4.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n    # 1.
