    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the specific section within the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that is dedicated to listing the names of the Prophets.\n2.  I will pinpoint the exact starting verse (*bayt*) where the first Prophet's name is mentioned.\n3.  Then, I will identify the ending verse where the last Prophet's name appears.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores these verses and their contents, and then prints the answer clearly, detailing which Prophets are mentioned in each verse within that range. This fulfills the requirement of using code to present the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses_in_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and displays the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the 25 Prophets of Islam.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The poem states in bayt 39 that 25 prophets will be detailed.\n    # The actual list of names begins in bayt 40.\n    # We will use a dictionary to map the verse number to the prophets mentioned.\n    prophets_by_verse = {\n        40: \"Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim\",\n        41: \"Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub\",\n        42: \"Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman\",\n        43: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, Taha (Muhammad)\"\n    }\n\n    start_verse = min(prophets_by_verse.keys())\n    end_verse = max(prophets_by_verse.keys())\n\n    print(f\"The names of the Prophets in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt {start_verse} to bayt {end_verse}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe details for each bayt are as follows:\")\n\n    # Print each verse number and the names contained within it.\n    for verse_number, names in prophets_by_verse.items():\n        print(f\"Bayt {verse_number}: contains the names {names}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_prophets_verses_in_poem()\n```\n<<<40 to 43>>>"
