# 1. Define the true biological extinction rate for an evolutionary species, mu_E.
# For the purpose of calculation, we can use a placeholder value of 1.0.
# The final multiplicative factor is a ratio and will be independent of this specific value.
mu_E = 1.0

# 2. The total extinction rate for a morphospecies (mu_M) is the sum of the true extinction rate
# and the rate of pseudo-extinction.
# mu_M = mu_E + rate_of_pseudo_extinction
# The rate of pseudo-extinction is composed of extinction from anagenesis (sigma)
# and from bifurcating speciation classification (0.5 * lambda_E).
# So, rate_of_pseudo_extinction = sigma + 0.5 * lambda_E.

# 3. We apply the key assumption derived from the problem statement: the rate of
# pseudo-extinction equals the rate of true biological extinction.
# This gives us the constraint: rate_of_pseudo_extinction = mu_E.
rate_of_pseudo_extinction = mu_E

# 4. Now we calculate the total extinction rate for a morphospecies, mu_M, by substituting
# the result from our assumption.
# The equation becomes: mu_M = mu_E + mu_E
mu_M = mu_E + rate_of_pseudo_extinction

# 5. The question asks for the multiplicative factor, which is the ratio of the morphospecies
# extinction rate to the evolutionary species extinction rate (mu_M / mu_E).
factor = mu_M / mu_E

# 6. As requested, we print each number in the final equation that leads to the answer.
