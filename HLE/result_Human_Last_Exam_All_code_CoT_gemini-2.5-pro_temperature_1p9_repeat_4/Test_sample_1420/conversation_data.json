    "Of course. Here is the plan to calculate the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** The calculation requires the spatial dimension `d`, the upper critical dimension `d_c`, and the number of components of the order parameter `n`.\n    *   `d = 3` (as given).\n    *   For this class of problems (like the Ising model), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n    *   The problem does not specify the model, so we will assume the most common case, the Ising universality class, where `n = 1`.\n2.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ):** The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as the difference between the upper critical dimension and the spatial dimension: `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **Use the Epsilon Expansion Formula for α:** To the first order in `ϵ`, the specific heat exponent `α` for an O(n) model is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Execute and Display:** A Python script will be used to substitute the parameters into the formula, display the step-by-step calculation with all the numbers, and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for a system in d=3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
