def find_photochemical_species():
    """
    Identifies and prints the indices of species that perform photochemical synthesis.

    This function is based on the biological knowledge that:
    - Algae, cyanobacteria, and plants perform photosynthesis (e.g., Gloeochaete, Aphanothece, Baileya).
    - Certain bacteria and archaea perform other forms of phototrophy (e.g., Halapricum, Ectothiorhodosinus, Chlorobaculum, Gemmatimonas).
    - Humans perform photochemical synthesis of Vitamin D.
    - Sponges, worms, fish, and molluscs in the list are animals that do not perform such processes.
