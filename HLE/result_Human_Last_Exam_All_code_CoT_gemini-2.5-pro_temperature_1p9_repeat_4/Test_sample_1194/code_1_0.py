    # Step 1: Define the context
    print("1. Context: Heterochromatin is a tightly packed, transcriptionally silent form of chromatin.")
    print("   - It spreads along the chromosome from a nucleation point.")
    print("   - Barrier elements are DNA sequences that stop this spread, creating a boundary.\n")

    # Step 2: Evaluate the provided options
    print("2. Evaluating the Options:\n")

    # Option A
    print("   - A. Enhance acetylation... promote euchromatic state.")
    explanation_a = "Histone acetylation (e.g., H3K9ac) is a classic mark of euchromatin (active chromatin). By recruiting Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs), barriers create a local environment that is actively hostile to the formation and spread of heterochromatin, which relies on H3K9 methylation. This is a key and well-documented mechanism."
    print(textwrap.fill(explanation_a, width=80, initial_indent="     ", subsequent_indent="     "))

    # Option B
    print("\n   - B. Recruit enzymes that demethylate heterochromatin.")
    explanation_b = "Recruiting histone demethylases to remove the H3K9me3 marks is a valid way to counteract heterochromatin. This is also a known mechanism that can contribute to barrier function. However, the active establishment of an opposing chromatin state (euchromatin) is often seen as the more primary function."
    print(textwrap.fill(explanation_b, width=80, initial_indent="     ", subsequent_indent="     "))

    # Option C
    print("\n   - C. Insulate nucleosomes, preventing any acetylation or methylation.")
    explanation_c = "This is incorrect. Barriers do not create a 'dead zone' for modifications. Instead, they are highly active sites that recruit specific enzymes to establish a particular chromatin state (usually euchromatic), which involves active acetylation."
    print(textwrap.fill(explanation_c, width=80, initial_indent="     ", subsequent_indent="     "))

    # Option D
    print("\n   - D. Disrupt histone-DNA interactions, destabilizing heterochromatin.")
    explanation_d = "This is too vague. While chromatin remodeling at barriers can alter nucleosome positions, the primary function is better described by the specific enzymatic activities that are recruited, such as those that cause acetylation."
    print(textwrap.fill(explanation_d, width=80, initial_indent="     ", subsequent_indent="     "))
    
    # Option E
    print("\n   - E. Block... through steric hindrance.")
    explanation_e = "This is an oversimplification. While insulator-binding proteins attach to the barrier DNA, their role is not just to be a physical roadblock. They serve as a platform to recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes, making the mechanism active rather than passive."
    print(textwrap.fill(explanation_e, width=80, initial_indent="     ", subsequent_indent="     "))

    # Step 3: Conclusion
    print("\n3. Conclusion:\n")
    conclusion_text = "The most accurate and primary mechanism described is the establishment of an active, euchromatic domain that serves as a firewall against the spread of silent heterochromatin. The key modification that defines this active domain is histone acetylation. Therefore, recruiting factors that promote acetylation is the principal function of many barrier elements."
    print(textwrap.fill(conclusion_text, width=80))
    print("\nAlthough the option incorrectly states 'acetylation of DNA' instead of 'acetylation of histones', it represents the correct core concept among the choices provided.")
