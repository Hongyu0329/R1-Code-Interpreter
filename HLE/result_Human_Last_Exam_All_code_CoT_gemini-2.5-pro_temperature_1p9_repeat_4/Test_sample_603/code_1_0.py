        'A': "Heat capacity change is assumed to be zero.",
        'B': "The NNPB parameters are T-independent.",
        'C': "Impossibility to capture heterogeneity in bulk experiments.",

    Thinking Process:
    1. The key terms are "bulk experiments" and "ideal experimental conditions".
    2. "Bulk" means the experiment measures the average behavior of a large population (ensemble) of molecules.
    3. "Ideal conditions" means we should disregard limitations arising from imperfect equipment or procedural errors.

    Evaluating the choices:
    - Choices A and B are about the *model* used for data analysis (the nearest-neighbor model often assumes Î”Cp=0), not a limitation of the *experiment* itself. More complex models can be used with bulk data.
    - Choices D and E describe *non-ideal* experimental conditions (imperfect temperature control), which the question asks us to ignore.
    - Choice C points to a fundamental consequence of averaging. In any large population of molecules, some may exist in different states (e.g., alternative conformations, misfolded states, or follow different melting pathways). A bulk experiment measures the average of all these states, smearing out the details. It cannot distinguish between a homogeneous population and a heterogeneous one. This loss of information about molecular variability is an inherent limitation of ensemble averaging.
    
    Conclusion: The impossibility of capturing molecular heterogeneity is the correct fundamental limitation.
