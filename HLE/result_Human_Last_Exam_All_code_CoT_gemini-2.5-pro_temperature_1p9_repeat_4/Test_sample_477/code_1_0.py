    Explains the role of LIG1 in CTG somatic instability
    in the context of Myotonic dystrophy.

    explanation = """
    1.  Context: Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by an expansion of CTG repeats. Somatic instability, the continued expansion of these repeats in body cells, worsens the disease.

    2.  Mechanism of Instability: Repeat expansion is believed to happen through DNA repair pathways. A temporary hairpin structure can form on the CTG repeat strand. DNA polymerase can fill in the gap, adding extra repeats, but this leaves a 'nick' in the DNA backbone.

    3.  Role of LIG1: DNA Ligase I (LIG1) is the enzyme responsible for sealing this final nick. By sealing the nick, it finalizes the repair process and makes the expansion permanent.

    4.  Impact of LIG1 Knockout/Reduction: If LIG1 is absent or deficient, it cannot seal the nick. The expansion process is aborted because the newly synthesized DNA strand containing the extra repeats is not properly integrated. This prevents the expansions from becoming locked in.

    5.  Conclusion: Scientific studies, particularly in mouse models, have demonstrated that reducing LIG1 levels significantly suppresses CTG repeat expansions. Therefore, knocking out or reducing LIG1 leads to reduced somatic instability.
