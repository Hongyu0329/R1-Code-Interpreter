    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is critical to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure proper instrument setup and accurate data interpretation. These controls can be divided into three essential categories.\n\nHere is my plan to calculate the total number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the foundational control. I will count one tube for the unstained beads to measure their natural autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap between the five different fluorophores, a separate control is needed for each one. I will count one control for each of the five channels.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For a multi-color sorting experiment, FMO controls are essential for accurately setting the boundaries (gates) to separate positive and negative populations. This is especially important when fluorescence from other channels can affect the baseline of the channel you are looking at. I will count one FMO control for each of the five channels.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that lists these controls, explains their purpose, and calculates the total number required.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorophores/channels in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    print(\"To ensure high-quality data and sorting purity, you should prepare three types of essential controls:\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
