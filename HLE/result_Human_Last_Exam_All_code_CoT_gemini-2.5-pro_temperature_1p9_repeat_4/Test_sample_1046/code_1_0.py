    """
    This function explains the biological reasoning for how a bacterium with a stable genome
    could acquire drug resistance as rapidly as one with frequent lateral gene transfer.

    print("Analyzing the problem step by step:")
    print("-----------------------------------")
    
    print("\nStep 1: Define the core puzzle.")
    print("Bacterium 1 uses lateral gene transfer, a very fast way to acquire fully functional resistance genes from other bacteria.")
    print("Bacterium 2 has a stable genome and relies on its own mutations, which are typically slower to generate effective resistance at a population level.")
    print("The question is: How can Bacterium 2's slower mechanism achieve the same result in the same amount of time?")

    print("\nStep 2: Evaluate the necessary factors for rapid evolution via mutation.")
    print("For Bacterium 2 to keep pace, its evolutionary process needs to be highly efficient. Two key concepts are critical:")
    print("  a) Compensatory Mutations: Initial resistance mutations often make the bacterium less 'fit' (e.g., grow slower). A second, 'compensatory' mutation can fix this problem, allowing the resistant strain to thrive and spread rapidly through the population.")
    print("  b) Cross-Resistance: This is a powerful accelerator. It occurs when a single mutation provides resistance to multiple different drugs. This means the bacterium gets a 'multi-drug resistance' package from a single evolutionary event, bypassing the need for multiple, independent, rare mutations.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluate the given answer choices.")
    print("A. Incorrect. 'Rare mutations' alone do not explain the rapid pace.")
    print("C. Incorrect. This option dodges the biological question by assuming an experimental error.")
    print("D. Incorrect. Without compensatory mutations, the resistant strain would likely be outcompeted due to a fitness cost, slowing its spread.")
    print("E. Incorrect. This is only part of the story. Compensatory mutations help the strain survive, but cross-resistance is needed to explain the breadth and speed of acquisition required to match Bacterium 1.")
    print("B. Correct. This is the most comprehensive answer. It includes the initial 'rare resistance mutations', the 'compensatory mutations' to restore fitness and allow for rapid spread, and the critical accelerator 'cross-resistance', which allows the bacterium to gain a wide spectrum of resistance efficiently.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The combination of compensatory mutations (to ensure the resistant strain is competitive) and cross-resistance (to make a single mutational event highly impactful) provides a powerful mechanism for the second bacterium to acquire resistance at a pace comparable to that of a bacterium using lateral gene transfer.")
