    "The main difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the foundational technique of how the bend is achieved, which directly relates to the placement of the hips.\n\n**Vaganova Method:** This technique emphasizes a very stable core and torso. When executing a cambré derrière, the bend is initiated from the upper spine, with the feeling of lifting the sternum towards the ceiling. The hips must remain square and directly over the supporting legs. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault, as it breaks the line and places undue stress on the lower back. The goal is a pure, controlled bend of the upper and middle back.\n\n**Balanchine Method:** This style often prioritizes creating extreme lines and visual impact. To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend in a cambré derrière, the Balanchine technique allows and even encourages the hips to press forward. This change in hip placement alters the center of gravity and facilitates a greater degree of flexibility in the backbend, creating a more pronounced curve.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While port de bras (arm carriage) styles differ between the methods, it is not the most defining difference for this specific step.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core technical difference. Vaganova keeps the hips stable and square, while Balanchine allows them to push forward. This is the correct answer.\n*   **C. Speed:** A cambré is generally a slow, sustained movement (adagio) in both techniques. Speed is not the primary differentiator.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the hip placement. Because the hip placement (B) is the *cause* of the difference in degree (D), it is the more fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement follows the line of the spine in both techniques to complete the visual line. While there might be subtle stylistic differences, it is not the foundational mechanical difference.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental distinction is the placement of the hip.\n\n<<<B>>>"
