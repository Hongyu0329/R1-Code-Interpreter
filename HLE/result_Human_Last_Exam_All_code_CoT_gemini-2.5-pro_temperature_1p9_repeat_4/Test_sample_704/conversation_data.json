    "Here is a plan to solve the riddle:\n1.  First, I need to decipher the colors mentioned in the question. The combination of yellow and blue produces the color green. The second color is explicitly stated as blue.\n2.  Next, I need to recall or look up Isaac Newton's mapping of the visible light spectrum to the diatonic musical scale.\n3.  The question asks for the musical note that corresponds to the \"range between\" green and blue. In Newton's system, he assigned a specific note to each color band. The green band is assigned a note, and it lies spectrally right before the blue band.\n4.  Therefore, the answer is the note that Newton associated with the color green.\n5.  I will write a Python script that defines this mapping, identifies the correct color, and prints the corresponding note along with the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by mapping Newton's colors to musical notes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to the musical scale.\n    newton_color_music_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors from the user's question.\n    # The color produced by combining yellow and blue is green.\n    color_1 = \"Green\"\n    color_2 = \"Blue\"\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the note for the range.\n    # The question asks for the note corresponding to the range BETWEEN green and blue.\n    # In Newton's mapping, the color band \"Green\" is assigned the note F.
