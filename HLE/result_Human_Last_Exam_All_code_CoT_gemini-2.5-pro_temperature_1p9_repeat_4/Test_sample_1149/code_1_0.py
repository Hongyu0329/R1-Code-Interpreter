# The question asks for the number of depressions contained within the lacrimal recess
# of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri. This is a specific anatomical fact found
# in paleontological literature.

# Based on the description by Sues et al. (2002), the lacrimal recess, a large
# depression itself, is excavated by a number of smaller openings (foramina).
number_of_depressions = 2

# We will print the final answer in a descriptive sentence.
# The "equation" will simply be stating the final number.
