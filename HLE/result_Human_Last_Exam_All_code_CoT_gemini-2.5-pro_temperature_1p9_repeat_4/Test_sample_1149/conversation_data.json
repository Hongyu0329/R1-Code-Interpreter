    "This is a question that requires looking up a specific anatomical fact from paleontological literature. My plan is to find the scientific paper that describes the skull of *Irritator challengeri* and extract the specific detail about the lacrimal recess. Then, I will present this factual answer using a simple Python script as requested.\n\nThe primary scientific paper describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri* is \"Irritator challengeri, a new spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002). According to this paper, the lacrimal recess (which is itself a large depression) is excavated by two large pneumatic foramina (openings). Therefore, the recess contains 2 depressions within it.\n\nThe following Python code will print this information.\n\n```python\n# The question asks for the number of depressions contained within the lacrimal recess\n# of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri. This is a specific anatomical fact found\n# in paleontological literature.\n\n# Based on the description by Sues et al. (2002), the lacrimal recess, a large\n# depression itself, is excavated by a number of smaller openings (foramina).\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# We will print the final answer in a descriptive sentence.\n# The \"equation\" will simply be stating the final number.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} smaller depressions, which are identified as pneumatic foramina.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
