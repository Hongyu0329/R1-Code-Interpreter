    "This is a factual question that can be answered by retrieving information from a knowledge base. Here is the plan:\n1.  Identify the key entities in the question: \"Nobel laureates\", \"Enron commercial\", \"2000\", and the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n2.  Search my knowledge base for the intersection of these entities to find the names of the individuals featured.\n3.  Create a simple Python script to store these names in variables and print them in a full sentence to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_enron_commercial_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in a 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Note: Paul Krugman won his Nobel prize in 2008, after the commercial aired.\n    # John Nash won his Nobel prize in 1994, before the commercial aired.\n    nobel_laureate_1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    nobel_laureate_2 = \"John Nash\"\n\n    print(f\"The two individuals, who are both Nobel laureates, featured in the 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline 'Ask Why' were: {nobel_laureate_1} and {nobel_laureate_2}.\")\n\nsolve_enron_commercial_question()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and John Nash>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
