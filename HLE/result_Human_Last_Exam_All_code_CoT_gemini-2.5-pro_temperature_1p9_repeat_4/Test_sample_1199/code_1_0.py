    Analyzes a C++ snippet to determine the number of virtual table loads
    under perfect compiler optimization and prints the reasoning.

    explanation = """
Step-by-step analysis of the virtual table loads:

1.  **First call: `a->foo()`**
    *   The line `A* a = new A();` creates an object of type 'A'.
    *   The compiler knows the exact dynamic type of the object pointed to by `a` is 'A' at this point.
    *   Therefore, the compiler can perform an optimization called "devirtualization" and call the function `A::foo()` directly, bypassing the virtual call mechanism.
    *   Number of virtual table loads for this call: 0

2.  **Second call: `a->foo()`**
    *   The function `escape(a);` is opaque to the compiler. It acts as an optimization barrier.
    *   The compiler must assume that the function could have changed the object's dynamic type (e.g., by using placement new to construct a different derived class object at that memory address).
    *   Since the object's type is no longer known at compile time, the compiler must perform a true virtual function call. This involves loading the object's vtable pointer and using it to look up the function's address in the vtable.
    *   Number of virtual table loads for this call: 1

3.  **Third call: `b->foo()`**
    *   The line `A* b = new(a) B;` uses "placement new" to construct a new object of type 'B' in the same memory location.
    *   The compiler sees this and knows that from this point forward, the dynamic type of the object pointed to by `b` is 'B'.
    *   Once again, the compiler can devirtualize the call and invoke `B::foo()` directly.
    *   Number of virtual table loads for this call: 0

Total Calculation:
The total number of virtual table loads is the sum of the loads from each call.
