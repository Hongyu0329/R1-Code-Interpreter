# The task is to identify the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from the given list.
# A mutualist is an organism that engages in a mutually beneficial relationship with another.
# For Asclepias fascicularis (a plant), mutualists are typically pollinators or defenders that receive nectar in return.

# Analysis of each option:
# 1. Danaus plexipus (Adult): Mutualist. Adult monarch butterflies are key pollinators of milkweed, feeding on its nectar.
# 2. Megachile frigidus (Adult): Mutualist. Adult leafcutter bees are effective pollinators, feeding on nectar.
# 3. Formica rufa (Adult): Mutualist. Ants are attracted to nectar and can defend the plant from herbivores.
# 4. Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult): Mutualist. Adult digger wasps feed on nectar and act as pollinators.
# 5. Pepsis thisbe (Adult): Mutualist. Adult tarantula hawk wasps are also pollinators that feed on nectar.
# 6. Megachile ericetorum (Adult): Mutualist. Like other leafcutter bees, adults are pollinators.
# 7. Danaus plexipus (Larva): Not a mutualist. The larva is a herbivore that eats the plant's leaves.
# 8. Megachile frigidus (Larva): Not a mutualist. The larva is in a nest and does not interact with the plant.
# 9. Formica rufa (Larva): Not a mutualist. The larva is in a nest and does not interact with the plant.
# 10. Sphex ichneumoneus (Larva): Not a mutualist. The larva is a predator on paralyzed insects in a burrow.
# 11. Pepsis thisbe (Larva): Not a mutualist. The larva feeds on a paralyzed spider in a burrow.
# 12. Megachile ericetorum (Larva): Not a mutualist. The larva is in a nest and does not interact with the plant.

# The indices of all mutualists are therefore 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
# The code will print these numbers as a comma-separated string.
