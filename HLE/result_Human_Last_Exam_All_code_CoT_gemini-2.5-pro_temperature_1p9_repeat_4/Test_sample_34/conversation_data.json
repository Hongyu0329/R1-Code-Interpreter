    "This is a poker theory question that can be answered using Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario**: The situation is a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game. The action is an open-raise to 2.5x from the button (BTN). The BTN is the most powerful position in poker, allowing for the widest opening range. The rake-free environment further encourages opening a wider range of hands because there is more money in the pot to win pre-flop.\n2.  **Define \"Worst Suited Jack\"**: The question asks for the \"worst\" suited Jack that one *should* still open. This implies we are looking for the hand in the JXs (Jack-X suited) category that has the lowest expected value (EV) while still being a profitable open-raise. Any hand weaker than this would be a fold.\n3.  **Rank Suited Jacks**: The value of a suited hand like JXs generally decreases as the second card (the 'kicker') gets lower. I can list the suited Jack hands from strongest to weakest: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    *   **Higher kickers** (like in JTs, J9s) offer better straight potential, better high-card value, and a lower chance of being dominated if you flop a Jack.\n    *   **Lower kickers** (like in J3s, J2s) have very little straight potential and are easily out-kicked. Their primary value comes from their ability to make a flush.\n4.  **Consult GTO Ranges**: Standard GTO charts for this scenario confirm that due to the power of position and the profitability of stealing the blinds, all suited Jacks are considered standard open-raises from the button.\n5.  **Identify the Bottom of the Range**: Following the ranking logic, J2s is the suited Jack with the lowest standalone equity and the worst playability. It is the most marginal, lowest EV hand within the \"suited Jack\" category that is still included in a GTO opening range. Therefore, it is the \"worst\" one you should still open.\n6.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a simple Python script that defines the list of suited jacks, identifies the weakest one, and prints the answer with a brief explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_opening_hand():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open-raise from the button\n    in a standard 100BB poker game, based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We list all suited Jack hands. In poker, these are ranked by their\n    # second card (the \"kicker\"). A higher kicker is better.\n    # The list is ordered from strongest (JTs) to weakest (J2s).\n    suited_jacks = ['JTs', 'J9s', 'J8s', 'J7s', 'J6s', 'J5s', 'J4s', 'J3s', 'J2s']\n\n    # The \"worst\" hand in a category that you should still play is the one with the\n    # lowest rank and lowest expected value, which is the last one in our ordered list.\n    worst_suited_jack_to_open = suited_jacks[-1]\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker principles for a 100BB cash game:\")\n    print(\"1. The Button is the strongest position, so you should open-raise a very wide range of hands.\")\n    print(\"2. A rake-free environment makes opening even more profitable.\")\n    print(\"3. All suited Jacks (from JTs down to J2s) are considered standard, profitable opens from the button.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe 'worst' hand to open is the one with the lowest expected value that is still profitable.\")\n    print(\"Within the suited Jack category, hand strength decreases as the kicker gets lower.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the worst suited Jack you should open from the button is: {worst_suited_jack_to_open}\")\n\nfind_worst_opening_hand()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
