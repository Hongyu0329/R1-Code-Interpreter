    "To determine which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert them from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If, during this conversion, the resulting sRGB values fall outside the valid range, the color is considered \"out of gamut\" and cannot be represented.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Linearize ROMM RGB**: The input ROMM RGB values are non-linear (gamma-corrected). The first step is to convert them to linear values. For the given inputs, this is done by raising the value of each channel (R, G, B) to the power of 1.8.\n2.  **Convert to XYZ D50**: Using a standard conversion matrix, we'll transform the linear ROMM RGB values into the CIE XYZ color space, which is a device-independent standard. ROMM RGB uses a D50 illuminant as its reference white point.\n3.  **Chromatic Adaptation**: The sRGB color space uses a D65 reference white point. We must apply a chromatic adaptation transformation (using the Bradford matrix) to convert the XYZ values from a D50 reference to a D65 reference.\n4.  **Convert to Linear sRGB**: Using another standard matrix, we'll convert the D65-adapted XYZ values into linear sRGB values.\n5.  **Check Gamut**: A color is representable in sRGB if and only if all of its linear sRGB components (R, G, and B) are between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n\nI will implement this conversion process in Python to check each color. The final output will be the list of numbers corresponding to the colors that are out of the sRGB gamut.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB colors from a given list are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of ROMM RGB color values to check\n    colors = [\n        (0, 0, 1),      # 1\n        (0, 1, 0),      # 2\n        (0, 0.5, 0.6),  # 3\n        (0.4, 0.5, 0.6),# 4\n        (1, 1, 1)       # 5\n    ]\n\n    # --- Transformation Matrices ---\n\n    # 1.
