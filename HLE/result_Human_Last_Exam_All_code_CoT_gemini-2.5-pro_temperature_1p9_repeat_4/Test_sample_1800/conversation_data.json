    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single fixed number but rather an optimal range that depends on the specific reaction (Water Gas Shift vs. Water Splitting), synthesis method, and operating conditions like temperature. The goal is to maximize the number of active Ni-O-Ce interfaces while preventing the formation of less active bulk NiO and ensuring thermal stability.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that summarizes findings from scientific literature. The script will define the commonly reported optimal atomic ratio ranges for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions and print this information in a structured format, including a pseudo-equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_optimal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Summarizes and prints the optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratios for Ni-Ceria catalysts\n    in Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions based on literature data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data from scientific literature on catalytic performance\n    catalyst_data = {\n        \"Water Gas Shift (WGS)\": {\n            \"lower_bound\": 0.1,\n            \"upper_bound\": 0.25,\n            \"reasoning\": \"This range maximizes the crucial Ni-O-Ce interfacial sites, which are highly active for the WGS reaction. Lower ratios limit active sites, while higher ratios can lead to the formation of bulk NiO, which is less effective.\"\n        },\n        \"Water Splitting (WS)\": {\n            \"lower_bound\": 0.2,\n            \"upper_bound\": 0.4,\n            \"reasoning\": \"For high-temperature water splitting or steam reforming, a slightly higher Ni loading enhances catalytic activity. However, exceeding this range can cause the Ni nanoparticles to sinter (agglomerate), leading to a loss of surface area and deactivation.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Summary of Optimal Ni/Ce Atomic Ratios for Ni-Ceria Catalysts\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n\n    for reaction, data in catalyst_data.items():\n        print(f\"\\nReaction: {reaction}\")\n        print(f\"Reasoning: {data['reasoning']}\")\n        \n        # Printing the numbers in a final equation format as requested\n        print(\"\\nOptimal Ratio Equation:\")\n        # The sys.stdout.write trick is used to print without a default newline,\n        # allowing for a more natural equation format.\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"    {data['lower_bound']} < (Ni/Ce)_optimal < {data['upper_bound']}\\n\")\n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n        \n    print(\"\\nNote: The ideal ratio is highly dependent on synthesis and operating conditions.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the summary\nget_optimal_ni_ce_ratio()\n\n```\n<<<The optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratio generally falls within the range of 0.1 to 0.4, with lower values (~0.1-0.25) favored for the Water Gas Shift reaction and higher values (~0.2-0.4) for high-temperature Water Splitting.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
