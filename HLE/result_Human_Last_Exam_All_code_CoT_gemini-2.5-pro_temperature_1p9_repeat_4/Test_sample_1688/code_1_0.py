Kerckhoffs's Principle is the foundation of modern cryptography, stating that a system's security
should depend only on the secrecy of the key. The scenario presented violates this core assumption.

In any encryption scheme, C = E(P, K), where C is the ciphertext, P is the plaintext, K is the key, and E is the encryption algorithm.
To decrypt, one computes P = D(C, K), where D is the decryption algorithm.

The premise states an adversary knows:
1. The system/algorithm (E and D) - This is assumed by Kerckhoffs's Principle.
2. The encryption key (K) - This is the critical new condition.

If an adversary has both the ciphertext (C) and the key (K), they can simply compute D(C, K) to find the plaintext (P).
Therefore, confidentiality is fundamentally broken by definition. Let's evaluate why the proposed solutions do not fix this:
