The question asks to identify the class of subsets of the natural numbers N that are existentially definable in the real numbers R, using the language of fields (+, -, *) and a predicate P for N. Arbitrary real parameters are allowed.

1.  First, we show that any recursively enumerable (r.e.) subset of N is definable in this way. By the Matiyasevich theorem (DPRM theorem), a set S is r.e. if and only if it is Diophantine. This means there is a polynomial P with integer coefficients such that n is in S if and only if there exist natural numbers z_1, ..., z_k such that P(n, z_1, ..., z_k) = 0. This statement can be written as an existential formula in the given language: we use the predicate P to ensure z_i are natural numbers, and the polynomial is expressed using +, -, and *.
    `exists z_1, ..., z_k in R (P(z_1) and ... and P(z_k) and P(n, z_1, ..., z_k) = 0)`
    This shows that all r.e. sets are definable. This rules out choices A, B, C, which are proper subsets of r.e. sets.

2.  Second, we show that any set definable in this way is recursively enumerable. A set S is defined by a formula `exists y_1, ..., y_m in R, phi(n, y_1, ..., y_m, c_1, ... c_k)`. Some of the conditions in phi may require certain polynomial expressions to be natural numbers. These can be rewritten using the P predicate and additional existential quantifiers. We want to know, for a given n, if this statement is true. This can be turned into a search procedure (a semi-algorithm). We can enumerate all possible natural number values for the variables constrained by P. For each choice, we are left with deciding an existential formula over the reals.
    The theory of real closed fields is decidable (Tarski-Seidenberg). While the parameters c_i could be non-computable, model-theoretic transfer principles ensure that if the formula is satisfiable for some n in N, it is also satisfiable with algebraic parameters. Since algebraic numbers are computable, the decision procedure for the existential theory of reals becomes effective.
    The search procedure enumerates tuples of natural numbers and runs a decision procedure for each. This procedure halts if and only if n is in the set S. The existence of such a semi-algorithm is equivalent to S being recursively enumerable.

3.  Combining both points, the class of definable subsets of N is precisely the class of recursively enumerable subsets of N. This corresponds to choice D.
    Choice E, arithmetical sets, is too broad, as this class corresponds to formulas with arbitrary alternations of quantifiers, not just existential ones.
    Choice F, all subsets of N, is incorrect because the logic of this structure is not powerful enough to define non-r.e. sets. Our construction of non-r.e. sets via a custom real parameter works on the surface, but the underlying theory ensures that such definitions can be algorithmically checked, which is not possible for non-r.e. sets.
