    "To answer your question, we must first understand how the Pauli exclusion principle is represented in the path integral formalism.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Pauli Principle and Grassmann Variables**: The Pauli exclusion principle, which forbids two identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state, is mathematically represented using anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. For any Grassmann variable `η`, the anticommutation rule `η * η = - η * η` leads directly to the property `η² = 0`. This `η² = 0` is the algebraic expression of the Pauli principle.\n\n2.  **Fermionic Integration (Berezin Integral)**: Integration over these Grassmann variables, called Berezin integration, is not defined by a standard measure but by a set of formal rules. These rules are designed to be consistent with the `η² = 0` property. The \"measure\" `dη` is a symbolic part of these rules.\n\n3.  **The Defining Rules**: For a single Grassmann variable `η`, the integral is defined by two fundamental properties. These properties are not derived; they are axioms that define the integration process. Any \"function\" of a single Grassmann variable `η` can be expanded as `f(η) = A + Bη`, since all higher powers like `η²` are zero. The integral is then defined as a linear operator satisfying the following.\n\n4.  **Code to Display the Rules**: The Python code below will print these two fundamental rules. These rules are the \"value\" or definition of the integral measure in this context, ensuring that the properties of fermionic fields are respected.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef display_berezin_integration_rules():\n    \"\"\"\n    In the path integral formalism, the \"measure\" for integrating over a\n    Grassmann variable is not a single number but is defined by a set of axiomatic rules.\n    These rules, known as Berezin integration, are constructed to be consistent with\n    the algebraic property η² = 0, which enforces the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n    This script prints the two fundamental rules that define this integral for a single\n    Grassmann variable η.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The Berezin integral over a single Grassmann variable η is defined by the following two rules:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Rule 1: The integral of a constant is zero.\n    # This rule ensures that only terms containing the variable contribute.\n    constant_part = 1\n    result_1 = 0\n    print(f\"Rule 1: The integral of a constant ({constant_part}) is defined to be {result_1}.\")\n    print(f\"∫ dη * {constant_part} = {result_1}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n\n    # Rule 2: The integral of the variable itself is normalized to one.\n    # This is the normalization convention.\n    linear_part_coeff = 1\n    result_2 = 1\n    print(f\"Rule 2: The integral of the variable η (multiplied by coefficient {linear_part_coeff}) is defined to be {result_2}.\")\n    print(f\"∫ dη * η = {result_2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"\\nThese two rules combined define the integral for any function f(η) = A + Bη as ∫ dη f(η) = B.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_berezin_integration_rules()\n\n```\n<<<The measure is axiomatically defined by the rules ∫ dη = 0 and ∫ dη η = 1.>>>"
