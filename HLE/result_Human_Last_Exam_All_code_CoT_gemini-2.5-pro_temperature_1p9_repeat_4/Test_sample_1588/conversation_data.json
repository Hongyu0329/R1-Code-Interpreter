    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of linearly independent commutators of order 10 involving two non-commuting variables, say X and Y. This quantity corresponds to the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree 10 in a free Lie algebra with two generators. The answer is given by Witt's formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce Witt's Formula**: The formula for the number of basis elements of degree `n` in a free Lie algebra on `k` generators is:\n    `L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where the sum is over the positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Set the Parameters**: For this problem, the order is `n = 10`, and we have two generators (X and Y), so `k = 2`.\n\n3.  **Identify Divisors**: Find all positive divisors `d` of `n=10`. The divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\n4.  **Implement the Möbius Function `μ(d)`**:\n    *   `μ(d) = 1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    *   `μ(d) = -1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    *   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n\n5.  **Create a Python Script**: Write a script to perform the following:\n    *   Calculate the value of `μ(d)` for each divisor `d`.\n    *   Calculate the value of `k^(n/d)` for each `d`.\n    *   Compute the sum `Σ μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n    *   Divide the sum by `n` to get the final result.\n    *   Print out each step of the calculation, including the individual numbers in the final equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of a number.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) -> {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    # Check for squared prime factors\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    \n    # If square-free, return (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of a number.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_order_count(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for order n and k generators\n    and prints the step-by-step calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero coefficients of order n={n} for k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's formula: L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(d) * k^(n/d)\")\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"\\nThe positive divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors}\")\n    \n    sum_terms_values = []\n    sum_terms_str = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power_val = k**(n // d)\n        term_value = mu_d * power_val\n        \n        sum_terms_values.append(term_value)\n        sum_terms_str.append(f\"({mu_d} * {k}^{n//d})\")\n        \n    total_sum = sum(sum_terms_values)\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Build the equation string\n    # e.g., (1/10) * [(1 * 1024) + (-1 * 32) + (-1 * 4) + (1 * 2)]\n    sum_calc_str = \" + \".join(sum_terms_str)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Construct the sum for L_{k}({n})\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * [{sum_calc_str}]\")\n\n    # Build the next step of calculation string\n    # e.g., (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]\n    values_str_list = [str(v) for v in sum_terms_values]\n    calc_str = \" + \".join(values_str_list).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: Evaluate each term in the sum\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * [{calc_str}]\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the total sum\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * {total_sum}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 4: Perform the final division\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = {total_sum} / {n} = {result}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is {result}.\")\n    \n    \n# Parameters for the problem\nn_order = 10\nk_generators = 2\n\nsolve_bch_order_count(n_order, k_generators)\n```\n<<<99>>>"
