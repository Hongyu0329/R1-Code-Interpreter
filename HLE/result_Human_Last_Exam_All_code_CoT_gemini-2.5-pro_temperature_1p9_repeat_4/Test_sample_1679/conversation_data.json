    "To find the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Locations:** First, I need to determine the locations of the Luxor Obelisks. There are two: one at the Luxor Temple in Egypt, and one at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Search Best Picture Winners:** I will go through the list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first award in 1929.\n3.  **Cross-Reference:** I'll look for the first film on that list that is set in or contains scenes in either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris, France, and explicitly shows one of the obelisks.\n4.  **Analyze Candidates:**\n    *   No early Best Picture winners were set in ancient or modern Egypt.\n    *   Several early winners were set in Paris, including *The Life of Emile Zola* (won in 1938) and *An American in Paris* (won in 1952).\n    *   While *The Life of Emile Zola* is set in Paris, it is a historical drama focused on interiors like courtrooms and offices. It does not feature prominent shots of Parisian landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   *An American in Paris*, by its very title and nature as a vibrant musical, is a celebration of the city. It contains numerous on-location shots and, most famously, a climactic ballet sequence that features stylized representations of Parisian landmarks. One of these is the Place de la Concorde, which prominently features the Luxor Obelisk.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\nHere is the Python code to print the answer.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the first film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture\n# and depicted a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n# There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France.\n# We need to find the earliest Best Picture winner set in either location\n# that shows the obelisk.\n\n# After reviewing the list of Best Picture winners, no early winners were set in Egypt.\n# We then look for films set in Paris.\n\n# \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937) is set in Paris but doesn't focus on landmarks.\n# \"An American in Paris\" (1951) is a musical that heavily features Parisian scenery.\n\n# The film's climactic ballet sequence includes a stylized depiction of the\n# Place de la Concorde, which is where the Parisian Luxor Obelisk is located.\n# The award was given in 1952 for the 1951 film year.\n\nmovie_title = \"An American in Paris\"\n\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
