# The task is to identify the first film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture
# and depicted a Luxor Obelisk.

# There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France.
# We need to find the earliest Best Picture winner set in either location
# that shows the obelisk.

# After reviewing the list of Best Picture winners, no early winners were set in Egypt.
# We then look for films set in Paris.

# "The Life of Emile Zola" (1937) is set in Paris but doesn't focus on landmarks.
# "An American in Paris" (1951) is a musical that heavily features Parisian scenery.

# The film's climactic ballet sequence includes a stylized depiction of the
# Place de la Concorde, which is where the Parisian Luxor Obelisk is located.
# The award was given in 1952 for the 1951 film year.
