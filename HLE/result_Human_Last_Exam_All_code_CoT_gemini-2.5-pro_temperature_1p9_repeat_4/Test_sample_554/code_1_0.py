# This script calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.

# 1. The chemical formula for a well-known nanocar molecule is C58H38.
num_carbon = 58
num_hydrogen = 38

# 2. The prefix "perfluoro-" means that every hydrogen atom (H)
#    is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).
#    Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms will equal the number of original hydrogen atoms.
num_fluorine = num_hydrogen

# 3. Explain the process and state the final result.
print("The chemical formula for a standard nanocar is C58H38.")
print("The term 'perfluoro' indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.")
print(f"In the original molecule, there are {num_hydrogen} hydrogen atoms.")
print("After perfluorination, these are replaced by the same number of fluorine atoms.")

# 4. As requested, output each part of the final formula: C58F38.
print("\nThe final equation is:")
print("C", num_carbon, "F", num_fluorine)

# 5. State the final answer clearly.
print(f"\nTherefore, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain {num_fluorine} fluorine atoms.")
