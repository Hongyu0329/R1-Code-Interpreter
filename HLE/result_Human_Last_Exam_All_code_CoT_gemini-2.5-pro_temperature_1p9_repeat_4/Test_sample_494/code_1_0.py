Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-zero hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1.  **The Origin of Tunneling:** Ammonia (NH3) has a trigonal pyramidal shape. The nitrogen atom can quantum mechanically "tunnel" through the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms, in a process called nitrogen inversion. This is possible because the two inverted states are separated by a finite potential energy barrier. In quantum mechanics, any particle has a non-zero probability of passing through such a barrier. This tunneling effect splits the vibrational ground state into two distinct, closely-spaced energy levels.

2.  **The Potential Energy Surface is Unchanged:** The shape of the potential energy surface, including the height and width of the barrier, is determined by the electrostatic forces between the electrons and the nuclei, and the masses of the nuclei. These factors are independent of nuclear spin. Replacing ordinary spin-1/2 hydrogen with exotic spin-0 hydrogen does not change the nuclear charge or (we assume) the mass, so the double-well potential that enables tunneling remains unchanged.

3.  **The Role of Nuclear Spin (Pauli Principle):** The primary role of nuclear spin is to dictate the overall symmetry of the total molecular wavefunction upon the exchange of identical particles.
    *   **Ordinary Hydrogen (Protons):** With spin-1/2, they are fermions. The total wavefunction of the molecule must be *antisymmetric* when any two protons are exchanged.
    *   **Exotic Hydrogen:** With spin-0, they are bosons. The total wavefunction of the molecule must be *symmetric* when any two of these exotic hydrogens are exchanged.

4.  **Conclusion:** The change from fermion to boson statistics does not eliminate the tunneling phenomenon itself. The double-well potential still exists, and the nitrogen nucleus can still tunnel through it. Therefore, the splitting of the ground state energy level will still occur.

What *does* change are the allowed combinations of rotational and vibrational states. The overall symmetry requirement (now symmetric for bosons instead of antisymmetric for fermions) alters the selection rules. This means the resulting absorption or emission spectrum of the exotic ammonia would be different from that of ordinary ammonia, but the fundamental feature of energy-level splitting due to tunneling would persist.
