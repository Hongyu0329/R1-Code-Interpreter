# Here is the Python code to provide the answer.
# The plan is to identify which champion's hook ability interacts with Flash
# in a way that allows its range to be extended by flashing backwards.

# Based on League of Legends game mechanics:
# - Blitzcrank's Q (Rocket Grab): Flashing repositions the hook's origin. It does not extend the range backwards.
# - Nautilus's Q (Dredge Line): Flashing repositions the hook's origin. It does not extend the range backwards.
# - Pyke's Q (Bone Skewer): Flashing repositions the hook's origin. It does not extend the range backwards.
# - Thresh's Q (Death Sentence): Flashing during the cast time moves the origin but keeps the original target vector,
#   which allows for the specific range-extending hook-flash by flashing backwards.
