    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the system**: We are dealing with a supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with `n=2` replicas.\n2.  **Identify the target manifold**: The fields of this model live on a supermanifold, which for class D with `n` replicas is the symmetric superspace `M = G/H`, where `G = OSp(2n|2n)` and the subgroup `H = OSp(n|n) x OSp(n|n)`.\n3.  **Define the \"bosonic sector\"**: The question asks for the number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables parametrizing the bosonic sector. This is the dimension of the bosonic base manifold of the supermanifold `M`, which is `M_B = G_B/H_B`. Here `G_B` and `H_B` are the maximal bosonic subgroups of `G` and `H`.\n4.  **Determine the bosonic subgroups**:\n    *   The bosonic subgroup of the orthosymplectic group `OSp(p|q)` is `SO(p) x Sp(q, R)`, provided `q` is even.\n    *   For `G = OSp(2n|2n)`, with `n=2`, we have `p=q=4`, so `G_B = SO(4) x Sp(4, R)`.\n    *   For `H = OSp(n|n) x OSp(n|n)`, with `n=2`, we have `p=q=2`. A single factor's bosonic part is `SO(2) x Sp(2, R)`. Thus, `H_B = (SO(2) x Sp(2, R)) x (SO(2) x Sp(2, R))`.\n5.  **Calculate the dimension**: The number of variables is the dimension of the manifold `M_B`, calculated as `dim(M_B) = dim(G_B) - dim(H_B)`. We will use the standard formulas for the dimensions of these Lie groups:\n    *   `dim(SO(k)) = k(k-1)/2`\n    *   `dim(Sp(2k, R)) = k(2k+1)`\n6.  **Implement in Python**: The Python code will perform the calculations using these formulas for `n=2` and print the result, showing each step of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bosonic_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmann variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model\n    of symmetry class D with a specified number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas\n    n = 2\n\n    # Formulas for Lie group dimensions\n    def dim_so(k):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the special orthogonal group SO(k).\"\"\"\n        return k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n    def dim_sp(k_even):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the real symplectic group Sp(k_even, R).\"\"\"\n        if k_even % 2 != 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"The argument for Sp must be an even number.\")\n        k = k_even // 2\n        return k * (2 * k + 1)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of bosonic variables for symmetry class D with n = {n} replicas.\")\n    print(\"The target supermanifold is G/H, where G = OSp(2n|2n) and H = OSp(n|n) x OSp(n|n).\")\n    print(\"The number of bosonic variables equals the dimension of the bosonic base G_B/H_B.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate dimension of the bosonic supergroup G_B = SO(2n) x Sp(2n,R)\n    g_so_k = 2 * n\n    g_sp_k = 2 * n\n    dim_g_b_so = dim_so(g_so_k)\n    dim_g_b_sp = dim_sp(g_sp_k)\n    dim_g_b = dim_g_b_so + dim_g_b_sp\n\n    print(f\"Dimension of the bosonic group G_B = SO({g_so_k}) x Sp({g_sp_k}, R):\")\n    print(f\"dim(SO({g_so_k})) = {g_so_k} * ({g_so_k} - 1) / 2 = {dim_g_b_so}\")\n    print(f\"dim(Sp({g_sp_k}, R)) = {g_sp_k//2} * (2 * {g_sp_k//2} + 1) = {dim_g_b_sp}\")\n    print(f\"Total dim(G_B) = {dim_g_b_so} + {dim_g_b_sp} = {dim_g_b}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Calculate dimension of the bosonic subgroup H_B = (SO(n) x Sp(n,R)) x (SO(n) x Sp(n,R))\n    h_so_k = n\n    h_sp_k = n\n    dim_h_b_so_factor = dim_so(h_so_k)\n    dim_h_b_sp_factor = dim_sp(h_sp_k)\n    dim_h_b_factor = dim_h_b_so_factor + dim_h_b_sp_factor\n    dim_h_b = 2 * dim_h_b_factor\n    \n    print(f\"Dimension of the bosonic subgroup H_B = [SO({h_so_k}) x Sp({h_sp_k}, R)] x [SO({h_so_k}) x Sp({h_sp_k}, R)]:\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of one [SO({h_so_k}) x Sp({h_sp_k}, R)] factor:\")\n    print(f\"  dim(SO({h_so_k})) = {h_so_k} * ({h_so_k} - 1) / 2 = {dim_h_b_so_factor}\")\n    print(f\"  dim(Sp({h_sp_k}, R)) = {h_sp_k//2} * (2 * {h_sp_k//2} + 1) = {dim_h_b_sp_factor}\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of one bosonic factor of H = {dim_h_b_so_factor} + {dim_h_b_sp_factor} = {dim_h_b_factor}\")\n    print(f\"Total dim(H_B) = 2 * {dim_h_b_factor} = {dim_h_b}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Final result is the dimension of the coset space G_B/H_B\n    num_variables = dim_g_b - dim_h_b\n    \n    print(\"The number of non-Grassmann variables is dim(G_B/H_B) = dim(G_B) - dim(H_B).\")\n    print(f\"Result = {dim_g_b} - {dim_h_b} = {num_variables}\")\n    \ncalculate_bosonic_variables()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
