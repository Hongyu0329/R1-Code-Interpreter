# Step 1: Define the values based on the interpretation of the equation.

# The symbols '𒌋' (10) and '𒁹' (1) are from the Babylonian cuneiform system.
# The term '𒌋𒌋𒌋' translates to 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.
denominator = 30

# The term '𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹' translates to (10 + 10) + (1 + 1 + 1) = 23.
subtrahend = 23

# The term 'หลวง' is not a standard numeral. A logical assumption is that it
# represents the number 900, as it creates a simple integer result when
# divided by 30, a common feature in such puzzles.
numerator = 900

# Step 2: Perform the calculation based on the translated equation.
# The equation is: 900 / 30 - 23
result = numerator / denominator - subtrahend

# Step 3: Print the final equation in modern numbers to show the solution.
# The output includes each number involved in the final calculation.
print("The equation translates to the following calculation using modern numbers:")
print(f"{int(numerator)} / {int(denominator)} - {int(subtrahend)} = {int(result)}")
