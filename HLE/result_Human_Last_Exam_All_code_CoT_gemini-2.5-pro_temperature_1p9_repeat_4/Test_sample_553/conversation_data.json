    "This is a music theory question. My plan is to first understand the musical terms in the user's question, and then find the song that fits the description.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the musical terminology**:\n    *   **Tonic**: This is the 'home' chord of a key. For a song in A minor, the tonic chord is A minor.\n    *   **Minor fifth chord**: This is the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale, but with a minor quality. In a minor key, this is a common chord. For example, in the key of A minor, the fifth note is E. A minor chord built on E is E minor (E-G-B). This chord is referred to as the \"minor dominant\" or \"v\" (lowercase Roman numeral).\n    *   **Chord Jump**: This implies a progression from one chord to the next.\n    *   So, we are looking for a song that starts with the progression: **tonic minor chord -> minor fifth chord** (i -> v).\n\n2.  **Analyze Beatles songs**:\n    *   A prominent candidate is the song **\"I'll Be Back\"** from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n    *   The song is in the key of A minor.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) is **A minor**.\n    *   The minor fifth chord (v) is **E minor**.\n    *   The song's verse begins with an A minor chord (\"*You know if you break my heart I'll go...*\") and immediately moves to an E minor chord (\"*...but I'll be back again.*\").\n    *   This perfectly matches the **i -> v** progression right from the start.\n\nAnother song people sometimes think of is \"Michelle\", but the tonic to minor fifth progression (Fm to Cm) in that song occurs in a later section (\"I love you, I love you, I love you\"), not at the very beginning of the song. Therefore, \"I'll Be Back\" is the correct answer.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific harmonic progression.\n    The progression is from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord (i -> v).\n\n    Analysis:\n    - The song is \"I'll Be Back\".\n    - The key is A minor.\n    - The tonic chord (i) is A minor.\n    - The minor fifth chord (v) is E minor.\n    - The song starts with this exact progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"I'll Be Back\"\n    key = \"A minor\"\n    tonic_chord = \"A minor (i)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"E minor (v)\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"It starts with a progression from the tonic chord, {tonic_chord}, to the minor fifth chord, {minor_fifth_chord}.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
