    "This is a trivia question about the web cartoon \"Homestar Runner\". I can provide the answer using a simple Python script as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  The question asks for the name of a fictional singer from a specific episode, \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n2.  I will define two variables in Python: one for the episode number and one for the singer's name, which I know from my data.\n3.  The script will then use a formatted string to print a sentence that answers the user's question, including the episode number as requested by the prompt's instructions.\n\n```python\ndef find_prom_singer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the fictional singer performing at the prom\n    in the Homestar Runner cartoon, \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The episode number in question\n    episode_number = 15\n    \n    # The name of the singer whose cardboard cutout is the \"performer\"\n    singer_name = \"Thom Yorke\"\n    \n    # Print the answer in a full sentence, including the episode number.\n    print(f\"In 'Teen Girl Squad #{episode_number}', the cardboard cutout performing at the Junior prom is of the singer {singer_name}.\")\n\nfind_prom_singer()\n```\n<<<Thom Yorke>>>"
