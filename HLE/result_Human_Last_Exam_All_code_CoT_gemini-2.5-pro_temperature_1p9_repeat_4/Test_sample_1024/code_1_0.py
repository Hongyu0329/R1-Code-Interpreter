    This function provides the solution to the multi-part literary puzzle.
    Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School," where a horse's tracks are disguised as a cow's. The answer is 6.
    Part B: The misremembered allusion underscores the novel's theme of education vs. mis-education, central to its academic parody. The answer is 3.
    Part C: Nabokov's most intense experience with back-referencing was his monumental annotated translation of "Eugene Onegin." The answer is 7.
    The sum is 6 + 3 + 7 = 16, which is a multiple of 8.
