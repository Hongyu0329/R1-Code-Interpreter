    "In the Feynman path integral formalism for a non-interacting system, the bare Green's function, $G_0$, which describes the propagation of a particle, can be derived from the action of the system. When we Fourier transform from real-time and space to frequency-energy and momentum space, the expression becomes particularly simple.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ in frequency-momentum ($\\omega, k$) space is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n*   $\\omega$: Represents the frequency (or energy) of the propagating particle.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$: Represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum). This is the energy the particle would have in the absence of interactions.\n*   $i\\delta$: Is an infinitesimally small imaginary part. The term `i` is the imaginary unit, and `delta` ($\\delta$) is a small positive real number that approaches zero. This term is crucial for handling the poles in the complex plane and correctly defines the time-ordering of the propagator. Its sign can depend on whether the state $k$ is occupied or empty relative to the Fermi sea, but the fundamental inverse dependence on $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ remains.\n\nEssentially, the bare Green's function has a pole whenever the particle's energy $\\omega$ is equal to one of the system's allowed single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this relationship by calculating $G_0$ for some sample values.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, delta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 in frequency-momentum space.\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency/energy of the particle.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        delta (float): A small positive infinitesimal for contour integration.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the bare Green's function G_0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Green's function is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta)\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * delta\n    g0 = 1 / denominator\n    return g0\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to demonstrate the calculation of G_0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Example values ---\n    # Frequency/energy of the propagating particle\n    omega = 2.5\n    # Single-particle energy of a specific state 'k'\n    epsilon_k = 2.4\n    # Small infinitesimal value\n    delta = 0.1\n\n    # Calculate G_0\n    g0_value = calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, delta)\n\n    # Print the equation with the numbers used\n    print(\"The bare Green's function G_0 is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta)\")\n    print(\"\\nWith the following values:\")\n    print(f\"omega     (ω) = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"epsilon_k (ε_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"delta     (δ) = {delta}\")\n    \n    # Final equation with numbers\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{delta})\")\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value of G_0 is: {g0_value}\")\n    \n    # You can also print the real and imaginary parts separately\n    print(f\"Real part: {g0_value.real:.4f}, Imaginary part: {g0_value.imag:.4f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<Inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and the single-particle energy ϵ_k, expressed as  $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$.>>>"
