    "The task is to determine the number of distinct colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus. I will write a Python script that accomplishes this by following these steps:\n\n1.  I will first identify the primary and distinct allotropes of phosphorus. These are white phosphorus (which can also appear yellow), red phosphorus, violet phosphorus, and black phosphorus.\n2.  I will create a list in Python where each element is a string representing one of these distinct colors.\n3.  The script will then count the number of elements in the list.\n4.  Finally, it will print out an equation that represents the counting process, showing a '1' for each color and then the final sum, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    of the main allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The four major allotropes of phosphorus have distinct colors.\n    # 1. White Phosphorus (often turns yellow upon exposure to light)\n    # 2. Red Phosphorus\n    # 3. Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's phosphorus)\n    # 4. Black Phosphorus\n    colors = [\"White\", \"Red\", \"Violet\", \"Black\"]\n    \n    # Count the number of colors\n    total_colors = len(colors)\n    \n    # As requested, create and print an equation showing how the total was calculated.\n    # We will represent each counted color as '1' in the sum.\n    equation_parts = ['1' for color in colors]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The calculation for the number of colors is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_colors}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nPhosphorus has {total_colors} major allotropes with distinct colors: {', '.join(colors)}.\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
