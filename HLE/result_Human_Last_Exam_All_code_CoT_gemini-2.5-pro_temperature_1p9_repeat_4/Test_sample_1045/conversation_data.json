    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms and their counts in the molecule:** Toluene has the formula C7H8, which means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For a second-row atom like Carbon (C):** The 6-31G basis set specifies:\n        *   One contracted function for the core (1s) orbital.\n        *   Two contracted functions for the valence s-orbital (2s).\n        *   Two sets of contracted functions for the valence p-orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz), which is 2 * 3 = 6 functions.\n        *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 2 (valence s) + 6 (valence p) = 9 contracted functions.\n    *   **For a Hydrogen (H) atom:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The 6-31G basis set specifies:\n        *   Two contracted functions for its single valence s-orbital (1s).\n        *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 2 contracted functions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:** Sum the functions from all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule formula: C7H8\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom with the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 2 valence s (2s) + 2*3 valence p (2p) = 9\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 2 valence s (1s) = 2\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from carbon atoms\ntotal_funcs_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * funcs_per_carbon\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from hydrogen atoms\ntotal_funcs_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_funcs_molecule = total_funcs_carbon + total_funcs_hydrogen\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation\nprint(\"To calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for Toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"1.
