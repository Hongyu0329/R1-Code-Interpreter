# Given parameters
E_g = 3.0  # Band gap in eV
E_peak_1s = 1.0  # Resonance peak for 1s exciton in eV
n = 3 # The principal quantum number for the target state

# --- Step 1: Calculate the 1s exciton binding energy ---
# The resonance peak energy is the band gap minus the binding energy.
Eb_1s = E_g - E_peak_1s

print(f"Eb_1s = {E_g} eV - {E_peak_1s} eV = {Eb_1s} eV\n")

# --- Step 2: Calculate the effective 2D Rydberg energy (Ry_2D) ---
# For a 2D system, the binding energy is Eb_n = Ry_2D / (n - 0.5)^2.
# For n=1, this means Eb_1s = Ry_2D / (1 - 0.5)^2 = 4 * Ry_2D.
# Therefore, Ry_2D = Eb_1s / 4.
Ry_2D = Eb_1s / 4.0
print(f"The effective 2D Rydberg energy (Ry_2D) is calculated from the 1s state:")
print(f"Ry_2D = Eb_1s / 4 = {Eb_1s} eV / 4 = {Ry_2D} eV\n")

# --- Step 3: Calculate the binding energy for the n=3 state ---
# The term "Rydberg energy for n=3" refers to the binding energy of the n=3 state (Eb_3).
denominator = (n - 0.5)**2
Eb_3 = Ry_2D / denominator
print(f"The binding energy for the n={n} state (Eb_3) is calculated using the formula:")
