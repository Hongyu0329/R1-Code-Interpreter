    """
    This function provides information on the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.

    A cap set in the vector space (Z/3Z)^n is a subset S that contains no three distinct
    elements forming a line (i.e., if x, y, z are in S and x + y + z = 0, then x = y = z).
    The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension n is denoted by r_3(n).

    The value of r_3(n) is unknown for most n, including n=8.
    The question asks for the best known lower bound for r_3(8).
    Lower bounds are established by discovering explicit constructions of large cap sets.
