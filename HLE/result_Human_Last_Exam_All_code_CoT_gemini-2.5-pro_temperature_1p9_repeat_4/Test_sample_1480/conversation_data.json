    "To calculate the rule activation level for a fuzzy rule, we typically use an implication method which is often a t-norm operation. The t-norm combines the firing level of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part) with the membership function of the consequent (the \"THEN\" part).\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define variables for the antecedent firing level, `Phi_k(x′)`, which is given as 0.7.\n2.  Define a variable for the consequent membership grade, `μG_k_j(y_j)`, which is given as 0.9.\n3.  Apply a t-norm operation. The most common t-norm is the minimum (min) operator, which I will use for this calculation.\n4.  The result of `min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))` will be the rule activation level.\n5.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the antecedent firing level.\nphi_k = 0.7\n\n# Step 2: Define the consequent membership grade.\nmu_g = 0.9\n\n# Step 3: Apply the t-norm operation.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, which we use here.\n# This calculates the activation of the rule's consequent.\nactivation_level = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_g)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated as the t-norm (minimum) of the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership grade.\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_g}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
