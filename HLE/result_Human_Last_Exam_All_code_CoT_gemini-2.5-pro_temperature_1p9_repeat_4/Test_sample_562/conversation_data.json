    "My plan is to first identify the radical, also known as bushu (部首), for the Japanese character 謄. Radicals are the components used to classify and look up kanji in dictionaries. Then, I will find the common Japanese name for this radical and provide its Hepburn transcription. I will write a simple Python script to display this information.\n\n1.  **Character Decomposition**: The character 謄 is composed of a left part and a right part.\n2.  **Radical Identification**: The left part, 言, is a common radical. This is the radical under which 謄 is classified in dictionaries.\n3.  **Radical Name**: The radical 言 is known as \"kotoba\" or \"iu,\" but when it appears on the left side of a character, it has a specific name: \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n4.  **Hepburn Transcription**: Transcribing \"ごんべん\" into Hepburn romanization gives \"Gonben\".\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will create a Python script that declares the kanji and its radical's name and then prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄\n    and provides its name in Hepburn transcription.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji = '謄'\n    # The radical for 謄 is 言, which is called \"gonben\" when on the left.\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n    \n    print(f\"The bushu / radical for the character '{kanji}' is called: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
