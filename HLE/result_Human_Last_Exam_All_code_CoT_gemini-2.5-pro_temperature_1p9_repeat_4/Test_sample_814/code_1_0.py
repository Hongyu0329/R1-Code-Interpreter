    }

    # Treatment Options Analysis
    # A. Duloxetine + Gabapentin: Covers pain, mood, and specific neurologic symptoms (paresthesia, RLS). Very comprehensive.
    # B. Gabapentin: Good for pain and neurologic symptoms, but less effective for depression/anxiety.
    # C. Duloxetine: Excellent for pain and mood, but may not be enough for RLS and paresthesia alone.
    # D. Cyclobenzaprine: Mainly for sleep and muscle spasm. Not a primary treatment for core symptoms.
    # E. Duloxetine + Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen has limited utility in fibromyalgia. Weak combination.
    # F. Duloxetine + Cyclobenzaprine: Good for pain, mood, and sleep, but Gabapentin is better for paresthesia/RLS.

    # Rationale: The patient has a classic, multi-faceted presentation of Fibromyalgia.
    # A single agent might not cover all symptoms effectively.
    # The combination of Duloxetine and Gabapentin offers the most comprehensive approach:
    # - Duloxetine targets the core pain, depression, and anxiety.
    # - Gabapentin adds another layer of pain control and specifically addresses the troublesome
    #   neurologic symptoms of paresthesia and restless leg syndrome, while also improving sleep.
    # This dual-mechanism approach is a standard strategy for moderate-to-severe Fibromyalgia.
