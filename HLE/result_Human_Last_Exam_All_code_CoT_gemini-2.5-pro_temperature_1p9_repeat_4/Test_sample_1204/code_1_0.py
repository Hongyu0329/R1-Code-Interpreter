    option_I = "Counsel patient on stopping cannabis"

    # Option II: Ask patient to request admission for med detox.
    # Analysis: Low priority and dangerous. Abruptly stopping all psychiatric medications
    # at once can cause severe withdrawal. Medication changes should be gradual and systematic.
    option_II = "Ask patient to request admission for med detox"

    # Option III: Order a urine drug test.
    # Analysis: High priority. A UDS provides objective data about substance use, which is
    # central to this case. It's a standard of care for diagnosis and safety.
    option_III = "Order a urine drug test"
    priority_III = "High"

    # Option IV: Prescribe melatonin for insomnia.
    # Analysis: Good choice. Insomnia is a major complaint. Melatonin is a safe, low-risk,
    # non-addictive intervention that directly addresses a key symptom while the
    # more complex underlying issues are managed.
    option_IV = "Prescribe melatonin for insomnia"

    # Option V: Discontinue acamprosate and increase naltrexone.
    # Analysis: Low priority. The patient is in remission for Alcohol Use Disorder. There is no
    # clinical indication to change a medication regimen that appears to be working for a stable condition.
    option_V = "Discontinue acamprosate and increase dosage of naltrexone"
    priority_V = "Low"

    # Option VI: Start atomoxetine.
    # Analysis: Inappropriate/Illogical. The case states the patient is already on atomoxetine.
    # One cannot 'start' a medication the patient is already taking.
    option_VI = "Start atomoxetine"
