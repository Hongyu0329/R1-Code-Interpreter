    "My plan is to first identify the numerical imprints on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules based on publicly available drug identification data. Then, I will write a Python script to compare these two numbers.\n\n1.  **Store the imprints**: The script will store the full numerical imprints, \"3108\" (for 10mg) and \"3109\" (for 20mg), in string variables.\n2.  **Compare the numbers**: The code will iterate through the digits of both numbers to find the specific digits that are different.\n3.  **Print the output**: Finally, the script will print the full imprint number for each capsule and then state the specific numbers that differ between them, fulfilling the request to show all numbers in a final comparative statement.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and compares the numerical imprints on two\n    different strengths of Teva brand fluoxetine capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on drug identification data, these are the numerical imprints.\n    # The imprint on Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsules is \"TEVA 3108\".\n    imprint_10mg = \"3108\"\n\n    # The imprint on Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsules is \"TEVA 3109\".\n    imprint_20mg = \"3109\"\n\n    # Lists to store the digits that are different\n    diff_digits_from_10mg = []\n    diff_digits_from_20mg = []\n\n    # Iterate through the strings and compare them character by character\n    # This assumes the imprint numbers are the same length.\n    for i in range(len(imprint_10mg)):\n        if imprint_10mg[i] != imprint_20mg[i]:\n            diff_digits_from_10mg.append(imprint_10mg[i])\n            diff_digits_from_20mg.append(imprint_20mg[i])\n    \n    # Format the final output\n    print(f\"The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\n    print(f\"The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n\n    if diff_digits_from_10mg:\n        # Construct the final \"equation\" or comparison statement\n        diff1 = diff_digits_from_10mg[0]\n        diff2 = diff_digits_from_20mg[0]\n        print(f\"Comparing {imprint_10mg} and {imprint_20mg}, the different numbers are {diff1} and {diff2}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The numbers are identical.\")\n\nfind_imprint_differences()\n```\n<<<8 and 9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
