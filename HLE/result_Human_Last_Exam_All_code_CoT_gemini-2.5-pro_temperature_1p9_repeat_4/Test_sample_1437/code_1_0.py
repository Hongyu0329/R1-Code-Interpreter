    # The Lindhard function at q=0, omega=0 is given by Pi(0, 0) = -N(E_F),
    # where N(E_F) is the density of states at the Fermi level.

    # For a D-dimensional homogeneous electron gas, the density of states N(E_F)
    # is related to the electron density 'n' and the Fermi energy 'E_F' by:
    # N(E_F) = (D/2) * (n / E_F)
