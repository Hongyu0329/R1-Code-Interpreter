    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in `ϕ⁴` theory near four dimensions, we need to analyze the renormalization group (RG) flow of the coupling constant. The fixed points of this flow correspond to scale-invariant theories, which are crucial for describing critical phenomena.\n\nHere is the plan to derive the expression:\n1.  **Start with the Beta Function**: The RG flow of a coupling constant `u` is governed by its beta function, `β(u) = μ * du/dμ`, which describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale `μ`. For the `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` (associated with a `(u/4!)ϕ⁴` interaction term) is well-established.\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point**: A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where the flow stops, meaning the beta function is zero: `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for u***: By setting the beta function to zero, we obtain an algebraic equation for `u*`. This equation has a trivial solution `u* = 0` (the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial solution, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is what we are looking for. The expression for this fixed point will be in terms of `ϵ`.\n4.  **Code the Solution**: I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to define the beta function symbolically and solve the fixed-point equation. The code will print out the steps of the derivation and the final expression for `u*`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point\n    coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols for the coupling 'u' and the small parameter 'epsilon'\n    u, epsilon, pi = sp.symbols('u epsilon pi')\n\n    # The one-loop beta function for phi^4 theory in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions.\n    # The convention used is for a Lagrangian with an interaction term (u/4!) * phi^4.\n    # The coefficient is 3 / (16 * pi^2) for a single-component scalar field (N=1).\n    coefficient = 3 / (16 * pi**2)\n    beta_u = -epsilon * u + coefficient * u**2\n\n    print(\"The one-loop beta function for the coupling u in ϕ⁴ theory is:\")\n    # Using symbols for a cleaner printout\n    print(f\"β(u) = -ε*u + (3 / (16*π²)) * u²\\n\")\n\n    # A fixed point u* is found where the beta function is zero: β(u*) = 0\n    # We are interested in the non-trivial fixed point (u* != 0).\n    # The equation is: -ε*u* + (3 / (16*π²)) * (u*)² = 0\n    # For u* != 0, we can divide by u*: -ε + (3 / (16*π²)) * u* = 0\n    \n    fixed_point_eq = sp.Eq(-epsilon + coefficient * u, 0)\n\n    print(\"The equation for the non-trivial fixed point u* is:\")\n    # To avoid floating point numbers in the printout, build the expression with Integers\n    u_sym = sp.Symbol('u*')\n    eq_to_print = sp.Eq(-epsilon + (sp.Integer(3) / (sp.Integer(16) * pi**2)) * u_sym, 0)\n    print(f\"{sp.pretty(eq_to_print, use_unicode=True)}\\n\")\n\n    # Solve the equation for u to find the expression for the fixed point u*\n    u_star_solution = sp.solve(fixed_point_eq, u)\n    \n    # The result from solve is a list, so we take the first element\n    u_star = u_star_solution[0]\n\n    # Now, let's explicitly print the final expression for u* with all its numerical parts.\n    num_coeff = 16\n    den_coeff = 3\n    print(\"Solving for u*, we get the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point:\")\n    print(f\"u* = ({num_coeff} * π² * ε) / {den_coeff}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_fixed_point()\n\n```\n<<<u* = (16 * pi**2 * epsilon) / 3>>>"
