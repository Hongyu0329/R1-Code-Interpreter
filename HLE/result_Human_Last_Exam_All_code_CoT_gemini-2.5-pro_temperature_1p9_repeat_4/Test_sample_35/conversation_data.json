    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct hand to shove all-in with:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Situation:** We are in a poker tournament, near the money bubble, in an early position (UTG1) with a 16 big blind (bb) stack.\n2.  **Strategic Considerations:**\n    *   **Stack Size (16bb):** This stack size is in the \"push/fold\" zone. Raising a small amount is generally incorrect because it commits a large portion of our stack and we'll often be forced to fold if another player re-raises (3-bets). Going all-in (\"jamming\") is the standard play.\n    *   **Position (UTG1):** This is an early position, meaning many players will act after us. We need a much stronger hand to shove here than from a later position because the probability of someone behind us waking up with a strong calling hand is higher.\n    *   **Bubble Factor:** Being near the money bubble creates significant ICM (Independent Chip Model) pressure. Players with medium and large stacks will call our all-in with a very tight range because they want to avoid busting before the money. This means our all-in has a high chance of success (high fold equity). However, if we *are* called, it will almost certainly be by a premium hand (e.g., big pocket pairs or strong Aces).\n3.  **Formulate a Shoving Range:** Given the high ICM pressure and our early position, we must be very selective. A standard \"GTO\" range for this stack depth is too wide. We need to tighten up considerably to account for the bubble. A safe and profitable shoving range in this specific spot is extremely narrow, consisting of only premium hands that perform well even when called. A reasonable range would be `TT+` (pocket Tens or better), `AQs+` (Ace-Queen suited or better), and `AKo` (Ace-King offsuit). Some might argue for `99`, but it's marginal as it performs poorly against the tight calling range of `TT+, AK`.\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:** We will check each hand from the answer choices against this tight, bubble-specific shoving range.\n    *   `QJs`: Too weak. It is dominated by many hands in a calling range.\n    *   `AJo`: A trouble hand. It is dominated by `AQ` and `AK` and is a big underdog to pairs like `TT+`. It's a clear fold given the circumstances.\n    *   `99`: Marginal. While a strong pair, it is in very bad shape against the `TT+` part of a likely calling range. Many tight players would fold `99` here to avoid bubble risk.\n    *   `AKo`: A premium hand. It has excellent equity against the likely calling range. It dominates `AQ`, is a coin flip against pairs like `QQ`, `JJ`, `TT`, and has blockers to `AA` and `KK`. This is the ideal hand to shove.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, `AKo` is the only hand among the choices that is a clear and profitable shove in this high-pressure situation.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to automate this decision-making process.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define card ranks for easy comparison\nRANKS = '23456789TJQKA'\n\ndef get_rank(card_char):\n    \"\"\"Returns the numerical rank of a card character.\"\"\"\n    return RANKS.find(card_char)\n\ndef check_hand(hand_str, shoving_range):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given hand is in the recommended shoving range.\n\n    Args:\n        hand_str (str): The hand to check, e.g., 'QJs', '99', 'AKo'.\n        shoving_range (dict): A dictionary defining the shoving range.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the hand is in the range, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    card1_rank = get_rank(hand_str[0])\n    card2_rank = get_rank(hand_str[1])\n    is_suited = len(hand_str) == 3 and hand_str[2] == 's'\n    is_offsuit = len(hand_str) == 3 and hand_str[2] == 'o'\n    is_pair = card1_rank == card2_rank\n\n    if is_pair:\n        min_pair_rank = get_rank(shoving_range.get(\"pairs\", \"Z\")[0])\n        return card1_rank >= min_pair_rank\n    elif is_suited:\n        for suited_hand in shoving_range.get(\"suited\", []):\n            min_high_card = get_rank(suited_hand[0])\n            min_low_card = get_rank(suited_hand[1])\n            if card1_rank == min_high_card and card2_rank >= min_low_card:\n                return True\n    elif is_offsuit:\n        for offsuit_hand in shoving_range.get(\"offsuit\", []):\n            min_high_card = get_rank(offsuit_hand[0])\n            min_low_card = get_rank(offsuit_hand[1])\n            if card1_rank == min_high_card and card2_rank >= min_low_card:\n                return True\n    \n    return False\n\ndef analyze_shove_options():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes poker hands against a defined shoving range for a specific scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Scenario ---\n    position = \"UTG+1\"\n    stack_bb = 16\n    situation = \"Near the money bubble\"\n\n    print(f\"Scenario: Shoving with {stack_bb}bb from {position} {situation}.\")\n    print(\"ICM pressure is very high, so our shoving range must be very tight.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # A tight shoving range for this spot: TT+, AQs+, AKo\n    # This range prioritizes survival and equity when called.\n    # Some might shove 99, but we'll use a tighter range of TT+ to emphasize bubble caution.\n    # AKo is included in 'offsuit' as 'KQ' would mean KQo, KJo, etc. We specify only 'AKo'\n    shoving_range = {\n        \"pairs\": \"TT\",      # Tens or better\n        \"suited\": [\"AQs\"],  # Ace-Queen suited or better (implies AKs)\n        \"offsuit\": [\"AKo\"]  # Ace-King offsuit\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Recommended Shoving Range: TT+, AQs+, AKo\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Hand Options ---\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"QJs\",\n        \"C\": \"99\",\n        \"D\": \"AJo\",\n        \"E\": \"AKo\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the options:\\n\")\n    final_decision = None\n    for choice, hand in options.items():\n        is_shove = check_hand(hand, shoving_range)\n        decision = \"SHOVE\" if is_shove else \"FOLD\"\n        if is_shove:\n            final_decision = choice\n        print(f\"Hand {choice}: {hand}\")\n        print(f\"   Analysis: This hand is outside a tight bubble range.
