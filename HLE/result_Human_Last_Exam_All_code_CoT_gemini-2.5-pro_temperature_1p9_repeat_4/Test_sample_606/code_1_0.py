# This script calculates the change in the effective number of neutrino species (N_eff)
# in a hypothetical cosmological scenario.

# Step 1: Define the baseline standard model parameters.
# In the Standard Model of Cosmology, N_eff is slightly greater than 3.
# We will use the commonly cited value.
Neff_standard = 3.044
print(f"The standard model value for N_eff is: {Neff_standard}")

# Let's think in terms of energy density units.
# The total energy density of relativistic species is parameterized by N_eff.
# The portion from neutrinos in the Standard Model is proportional to Neff_standard.
# Let's define a base unit as the energy density of a single ideal neutrino species.
# So, the total neutrino energy density in the SM is Neff_standard times this unit.
rho_nu_standard = Neff_standard  # Using relative units where one neutrino species has density = 1.
print(f"In relative units, the standard neutrino energy density is: {rho_nu_standard}")

# Step 2: Introduce the new physics.
# A new heavy particle decays, adding energy SOLELY to the neutrinos.
# Let's assume this decay adds a certain amount of energy density.
# The exact amount would depend on the particle's mass and abundance,
# but for this problem, we only need to know that it's a positive value.
# Let's choose a hypothetical positive value for this added energy density.
delta_rho_nu_from_decay = 1.5
print(f"\nThe new particle decays, injecting additional energy density into the neutrino sector.")
print(f"Added neutrino energy density from decay: {delta_rho_nu_from_decay}")

# Step 3: Calculate the new total neutrino energy density.
# The new total energy density is the sum of the standard amount plus the new amount.
rho_nu_new = rho_nu_standard + delta_rho_nu_from_decay
print(f"The new total neutrino energy density is: {rho_nu_standard} + {delta_rho_nu_from_decay} = {rho_nu_new}")

# Step 4: Calculate the new N_eff.
# The new N_eff is simply the new total neutrino energy density,
# as we defined our units relative to a single neutrino species.
Neff_new = rho_nu_new
print(f"\nThe new N_eff is calculated from this new total energy density.")
print(f"Final N_eff = {Neff_new}")

# Final conclusion based on the calculation.
if Neff_new > Neff_standard:
    conclusion = "increase"
else:
    # This case is not possible given the problem statement but included for completeness.
    conclusion = "decrease or stay the same"

# The prompt asks for the final answer in a specific format. The question is "would Neff increase or decrease".
# The output will be the answer to that question.
# To be extra explicit, we can format the final conclusion clearly.
