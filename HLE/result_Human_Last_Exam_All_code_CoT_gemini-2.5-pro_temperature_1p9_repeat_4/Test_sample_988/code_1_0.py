    print("Step 1: Understand the stressor and its effect.")
    print("High temperature (29°C for this tropical/subtropical cyanobacterium) can disrupt metabolic pathways, particularly photosynthesis and respiration. This disruption leads to the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, causing oxidative stress.\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluate the cellular defense mechanisms.")
    print("To protect themselves from oxidative damage, cells have a sophisticated antioxidant defense system. This system can be broadly divided into enzymatic and non-enzymatic components (which include hydrosoluble and liposoluble antioxidants).\n")

    print("Step 3: Determine the 'initial' response.")
    print("The term 'initially activated' points to the first line of defense. When ROS levels begin to rise, the cell's primary and most rapid response is to increase the activity of enzymes specifically designed to neutralize these harmful molecules.")
    print("Key enzymes in this response include:")
    print(" - Superoxide Dismutase (SOD): Converts superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide.")
    print(" - Catalase (CAT) and Peroxidases (e.g., Ascorbate Peroxidase, APX): Detoxify hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.\n")
    print("Scientific studies on Microcystis aeruginosa have consistently shown that the activity of these very enzymes (CAT, APX, SOD) increases significantly and rapidly upon exposure to stressors like high temperature. While non-enzymatic antioxidants are also crucial, the enzymatic system represents the immediate, activated defense.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.")
    print("The initial activation to counteract the immediate threat of ROS is handled by the enzymatic antioxidant system.\n")
    
    correct_option = 'C'
    print(f"Final Answer Choice: {correct_option}")
    print(f"The correct option is C because {options[correct_option]} are the first line of defense activated to combat the immediate increase in Reactive Oxygen Species caused by heat stress.")
