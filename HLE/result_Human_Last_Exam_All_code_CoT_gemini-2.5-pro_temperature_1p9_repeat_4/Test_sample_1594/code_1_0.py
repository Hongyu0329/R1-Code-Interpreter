  This function represents the process of identifying the shape
  formed by the buildings of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and
  Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa from an aerial view.
  
  The process is as follows:
  1. Locate the two schools using a map service. They are adjacent
     on Via Benedetto Croce in Pisa, Italy.
  2. Switch to satellite view to observe the buildings' layout.
  3. The combined footprint of the main buildings clearly forms a
     specific letter of the alphabet.

  The identified letter is 'E'.
