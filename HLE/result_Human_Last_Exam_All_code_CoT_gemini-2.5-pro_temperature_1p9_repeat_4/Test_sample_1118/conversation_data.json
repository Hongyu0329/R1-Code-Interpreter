    "To answer your question, I will first research the specific painting you mentioned, Curt Querner's self-portrait from 1933. I'll identify the object he is holding and its symbolic meaning within the historical context of his political persecution.\n\nMy plan is to then create a Python script. This script will store the key pieces of information (the artist's name, the year, and the symbolic object) in variables and then use a `print()` statement to construct a sentence that directly answers your question. This approach fulfills the requirements of providing a code-based solution and using the print function for the output.\n\n```python\ndef solve_querner_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's question about\n    Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The question refers to the painting \"Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblumen\"\n    # (Self-Portrait with Poppy Flowers).\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    symbol = \"a poppy flower\"\n\n    # In his self-portrait from that year, Querner, who was a communist\n    # and faced persecution, holds a poppy flower. The red poppy can be\n    # seen as a symbol of defiance, life, and resistance against the\n    # rising Nazi regime.\n    # The code prints the numbers and the final answer as requested.\n    print(f\"In the year {year}, the artist {artist} painted a self-portrait after escaping persecution.\")\n    print(f\"In his hand, he holds {symbol} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nsolve_querner_riddle()\n```\n<<<a poppy flower>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In 1933, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait after having escaped from Gestapo.
