    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand Prime Factorization**: Any integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. The largest of these prime numbers is the largest prime divisor.\n2.  **Devise an Algorithm**: I will use an efficient trial division method. The plan is to:\n    a. Check for divisibility by 2.\n    b. Then, check for divisibility by odd numbers (`d`) starting from 3.\n    c. This checking only needs to go up to the square root of the number (`sqrt(n)`). If we find a factor `d`, we divide `n` by it repeatedly and continue. If we've checked all numbers up to `sqrt(n)` and found no factors, the remaining value of `n` must be a prime number itself.\n3.  **Write the Python Code**: I will write a Python script to implement this algorithm. The script will find all prime factors, print the factorization equation, and then identify the largest factor from the list.\n4.  **Execute and Find the Answer**: The script will process the number 8139881 and output the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the prime factorization of a given number,\n    prints the factorization equation, and returns the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_number = number\n    factors = []\n\n    # First, handle the factor of 2\n    while number % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        number //= 2\n\n    # Next, handle odd factors from 3 up to sqrt(number)\n    d = 3\n    while d * d <= number:\n        while number % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            number //= d\n        d += 2\n\n    # If the number is still greater than 1, it must be a prime factor itself.\n    # This handles the case where the original number is prime or has a large prime factor.\n    if number > 1:\n        factors.append(number)\n\n    # If no factors were found and the original number is > 1, it's a prime number.\n    if not factors and original_number > 1:\n        factors.append(original_number)\n        \n    # Print the prime factorization equation\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    if factors:\n        equation_str = f\"{original_number} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n        print(equation_str)\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor is {largest_prime}.\")\n        return largest_prime\n    else:\n        print(f\"{original_number} does not have any prime divisors.\")\n        return None\n\n# The number we want to analyze\nn = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(n)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
