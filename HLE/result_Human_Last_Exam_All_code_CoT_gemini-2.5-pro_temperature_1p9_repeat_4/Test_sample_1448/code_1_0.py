    # The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is a cornerstone of many-body theory for describing two-particle correlations.
    # It provides a non-perturbative way to compute the two-particle Green's function.
    # The equation can be written schematically as G = G₀ + G₀ * K * G, where:
    # - G is the full two-particle Green's function, which determines the scattering amplitude.
    # - G₀ is the product of two non-interacting single-particle propagators.
    # - K is the interaction kernel, which sums all two-particle irreducible interaction diagrams.
    #
    # Therefore, the BSE provides a relationship or correspondence that allows one to calculate
    # the full scattering amplitude (G) from the interaction kernel (K).

    The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is an integral equation that describes the scattering of two interacting particles. It establishes a correspondence between the complete two-particle scattering amplitude (which contains all possible interactions) and the interaction kernel. The interaction kernel is defined as the sum of all two-particle irreducible diagrams, representing the fundamental interactions that cannot be broken down further within the two-particle framework. Therefore, the BSE relates the scattering amplitude to the interaction kernel.
