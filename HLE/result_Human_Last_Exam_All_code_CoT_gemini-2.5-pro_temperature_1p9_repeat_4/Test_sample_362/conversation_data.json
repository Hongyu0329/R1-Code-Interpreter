    "My plan to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:** I will first identify the two reactants provided: the aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and the Wittig reagent ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane).\n2.  **Recall the Wittig Reaction Mechanism:** This reaction involves the formation of an alkene. The oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) is replaced by the carbon group of the phosphonium ylide (P=CR'R''). The other product is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n3.  **Construct the Product:** I will combine the carbon skeleton from the aldehyde `((CH₃)₃C-CH=)` with the carbon skeleton from the ylide `(=CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄))` to form the new alkene.\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:** I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the resulting alkene structure, `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`. This involves finding the longest carbon chain containing the double bond, numbering it to give the double bond the lowest possible number, identifying all substituents, and assembling the name. I will also consider the stereochemistry (E/Z isomerism), noting that unstabilized ylides typically yield the Z-alkene.\n5.  **Generate the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically represents these steps, printing the logic and the final derived product name, as requested. The code will explicitly highlight the numbers in the final product's name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of a Wittig reaction and prints the step-by-step derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants\n    aldehyde_name = \"pivalaldehyde\"\n    aldehyde_fragment = \"(CH3)3C-CH\"\n\n    ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    ylide_fragment = \"CH-CH2-(2-ClC6H4)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Wittig Reaction Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Reactant 1 (Aldehyde): {aldehyde_name}\")\n    print(f\"Reactant 2 (Ylide): {ylide_name}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the reaction mechanism and product construction\n    print(\"Step 2: The Wittig Reaction combines the carbon frameworks of the reactants.\")\n    print(\"The (CH3)3C-CH= part of the aldehyde reacts with the =CH-CH2-(2-ClC6H4) part of the ylide.\")\n    product_structure = f\"{aldehyde_fragment}=CH-CH2-(2-ClC6H4)\"\n    print(f\"This forms a new alkene with the structure: {product_structure}\")\n    print(\"The other product is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3P=O).\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Naming the product (IUPAC Nomenclature)\n    print(\"Step 3: Determining the IUPAC name for the product.\")\n    print(\"1.
