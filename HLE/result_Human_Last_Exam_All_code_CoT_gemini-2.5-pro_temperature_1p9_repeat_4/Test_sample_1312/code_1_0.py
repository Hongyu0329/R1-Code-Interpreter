    Thinking Process to Arrive at the Correct Answer:

    1. Deconstruct the Question: The core of the question is about finding a feature of the genome's physical structure ("intrinsic genome architectural feature") that compensates for the negative effects of "limited recombination." Limited recombination leads to "genetic deterioration" because it prevents the separation of beneficial and deleterious mutations (a process known as Muller's Ratchet).

    2. Evaluate Each Option:
       - A, C, D, E: These options involve creating new genetic material or variation. Multigene families (D) and Polyploidy (E) create redundancy by duplicating genes, which provides a buffer against deleterious mutations. A working copy of a gene can mask a broken one. This is a valid way to prevent the *consequences* of deterioration.
       - B: Chromosomal inversions are sections of a chromosome that have been flipped. Their primary effect is to suppress recombination within the inverted segment. This seems counter-intuitive at first.

    3. The "Supergene" Hypothesis (The key insight for choice B):
       While inversions suppress recombination, this can be highly advantageous. In a population with limited recombination, natural selection is inefficient because genes are tightly linked. If a favorable combination of alleles (a "co-adapted gene complex") arises, it is at risk of being broken up by recombination.
       An inversion can capture this entire beneficial set of genes, effectively 'locking' them together. This locked block of genes is known as a "supergene." It now evolves as a single unit. This allows natural selection to act on the entire successful block, rather than inefficiently on the individual genes. By preserving this optimal combination, the inversion serves as a compensatory mechanism, preventing the genetic deterioration that would result from the breakup of the complex.

    4. Conclusion: While gene duplication (D, E) provides a buffer, the specific hypothesis of a genome architectural feature making selection itself more efficient under limited recombination points directly to chromosomal inversions creating supergenes. This is a classic concept in evolutionary genomics.
