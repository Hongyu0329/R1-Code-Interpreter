# The problem simplifies to a recursive calculation.
# Let x_k be the value after k applications.
# The initial value, derived from A = succ(I), is 2.
x0 = 2

# The operation B, when applied to a Church numeral n, transforms it to n^3.
# The expression evaluates to B(B(B(A))), so we apply this operation three times.
print(f"The initial value is x0 = {x0}")

# First application of the B operator
x1 = x0 ** 3
print(f"After the 1st application of B, we get x1 = {x0}^3 = {x1}")

# Second application
x2 = x1 ** 3
print(f"After the 2nd application of B, we get x2 = {x1}^3 = {x2}")

# Third application gives the final church integer n
n_val = x2 ** 3
print(f"After the 3rd application of B, we get the final number n = {x2}^3 = {n_val}")

# The question asks for the base-2 logarithm of n.
# n = ((2^3)^3)^3 = 2^(3*3*3) = 2^27.
# Therefore, log_2(n) = 27.
