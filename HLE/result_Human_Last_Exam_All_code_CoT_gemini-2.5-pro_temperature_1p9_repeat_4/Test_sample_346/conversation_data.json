    "This problem requires us to determine the value of a Church integer `n` represented by a complex SKI combinator expression and then find its base-2 logarithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Simplify the SKI expression**: I will analyze the structure of the given expression and use the reduction rules of SKI combinators (`S`, `K`, `I`) to simplify it into a more understandable form.\n2.  **Identify the components**: The simplified expression will involve two main components, which I'll call `A` and `B`. I will determine what these components represent in the context of Church numerals.\n3.  **Determine the operation**: The simplified expression is of the form `B(B(B(A)))`. This means a function `B` is applied three times to an initial value `A`. I need to deduce what this function `B` does to a Church numeral.\n4.  **Calculate the value of n**: Using the initial value `A` and the function `B`, I will calculate the final integer `n` by applying the function iteratively.\n5.  **Compute log_2(n)**: Once `n` is found, I will calculate its base-2 logarithm.\n6.  **Provide the Code**: I will write a Python script that implements the calculation to find the final answer, showing each step of the iterative process.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Expression Simplification**:\n    The expression `E` is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`.\n    The `S` combinator's rule is `S x y z = x z (y z)`. The `I` combinator's rule is `I x = x`.\n    `S I y z` simplifies to `I z (y z)`, which further reduces to `z (y z)`.\n    By repeatedly applying this rule, the expression `E` reduces as follows:\n    `E = S(I)(Y)(B)` where `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))` reduces to `B (Y B)`.\n    `Y B = S(I)(W)(B)` where `W = S(I)(K(A))` reduces to `B (W B)`.\n    `W B = S(I)(K(A))(B)` reduces to `B ((K A) B)`.\n    The `K` combinator's rule is `K x y = x`, so `(K A) B = A`.\n    Substituting everything back, we get: `E = B(B(B(A)))`.\n\n2.  **Identifying A and B**:\n    -   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`. The combinator `succ = S(S(K(S))(K))` is the standard successor function for Church numerals. The combinator `I` is equivalent to the Church numeral for 1. Therefore, `A = succ(1) = 2`.\n    -   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`. This is `succ` applied to `S(I)(I)`. The combinator `U = S(I)(I)` is the self-application combinator, `U f = f(f)`.\n\n3.  **The Operation B(n)**:\n    -   The `succ` function is `succ n f x = f(n f x)`.\n    -   Here `n` is `U`, so `B = succ(U) = λf x. f(U f x)`.\n    -   Since `U f = f f`, we have `B = λf x. f(f f x)`.\n    -   Now, we find the effect of applying `B` to a Church numeral `n`. This is written as `B(n)`. We substitute `n` for `f` in `B`'s definition: the resulting numeral is `λx. n(n n x)`.\n    -   In Church numeral arithmetic, applying a numeral `m` to `k` (`m k`) is multiplication (`m * k`).\n    -   So, `n n` evaluates to `n * n = n^2`.\n    -   Then `n(n^2)` evaluates to `n * n^2 = n^3`.\n    -   Therefore, the function `B` transforms a numeral `n` into `n^3`.\n\n4.  **Calculating n**:\n    We have a recurrence relation `x_{k+1} = (x_k)^3` with `x_0 = A = 2`. We need to find `n = x_3`.\n    -   `x_0 = 2`\n    -   `x_1 = (x_0)^3 = 2^3 = 8`\n    -   `x_2 = (x_1)^3 = 8^3 = 512`\n    -   `x_3 = n = (x_2)^3 = 512^3`\n\n5.  **Final Answer**:\n    We need `log_2(n) = log_2(512^3)`.\n    Using logarithm properties, this is `3 * log_2(512)`.\n    Since `512 = 2^9`, `log_2(512) = 9`.\n    The final answer is `3 * 9 = 27`. Note that `n = 512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^{27}`.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem simplifies to a recursive calculation.\n# Let x_k be the value after k applications.\n# The initial value, derived from A = succ(I), is 2.\nx0 = 2\n\n# The operation B, when applied to a Church numeral n, transforms it to n^3.\n# The expression evaluates to B(B(B(A))), so we apply this operation three times.\nprint(f\"The initial value is x0 = {x0}\")\n\n# First application of the B operator\nx1 = x0 ** 3\nprint(f\"After the 1st application of B, we get x1 = {x0}^3 = {x1}\")\n\n# Second application\nx2 = x1 ** 3\nprint(f\"After the 2nd application of B, we get x2 = {x1}^3 = {x2}\")\n\n# Third application gives the final church integer n\nn_val = x2 ** 3\nprint(f\"After the 3rd application of B, we get the final number n = {x2}^3 = {n_val}\")\n\n# The question asks for the base-2 logarithm of n.\n# n = ((2^3)^3)^3 = 2^(3*3*3) = 2^27.\n# Therefore, log_2(n) = 27.\nlog2_n = math.log2(n_val)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final church integer n can be written as an equation:\")\nprint(\"n = ((2^3)^3)^3 = 2^(3*3*3) = 2^27\")\nprint(f\"The value of log_2(n) is therefore log_2(2^27), which is {log2_n:.0f}.\")\n```\n<<<27>>>"
