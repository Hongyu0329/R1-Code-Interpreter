    "My plan is to solve this problem by applying the principles of statistical mechanics, whose foundations are described by large deviation theorems like the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem. This theorem implies that the equilibrium state of a system is the macroscopic state with the highest probability, which corresponds to the state of maximum entropy. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem provides the bounds for the probability of deviations from the average behavior, reinforcing that for a large system, the state of maximum entropy is overwhelmingly the most likely.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Identify the System:** We are dealing with a gas of light quanta (photons), which are bosons. A key property is that their total number is not conserved. In the language of statistical mechanics, this means their chemical potential is zero.\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium Distribution:** The process of maximizing the entropy for a Bose gas subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy (canonical ensemble) and zero chemical potential leads to the celebrated Planck distribution. This distribution gives the average number of photons `<n(ε)>` in a state with energy `ε` at a given temperature `T`.\n3.  **Calculate Mean Energy:** The equilibrium mean energy `U` is found by integrating the energy of each state (`ε`) multiplied by the number of photons in that state (`<n(ε)>`) over the continuous density of states `g(ε)` available to photons in a 3D volume. This results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy. We will present the mean energy density, `u = U/V`.\n4.  **Calculate Entropy:** The equilibrium entropy `S` can then be derived from the energy `U` using fundamental thermodynamic relations for a photon gas. We will present the entropy density, `s = S/V`.\n\nThe following Python script will outline this derivation and print the final, explicit equations for the equilibrium mean energy density and entropy density.\n\n```python\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    of a photon gas based on principles of statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium State of a Photon Gas ---\")\n    print(\"Based on large deviation principles, the equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the state of maximum entropy.\")\n    print(\"For a gas of photons (bosons with zero chemical potential), this leads to the Planck distribution.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The Planck distribution for the mean occupation number of a state with energy ε at temperature T is:\")\n    print(\"<n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B * T)) - 1)\")\n    print(\"where k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: To find the mean energy density (U/V), we integrate ε * <n(ε)> over the density of states g(ε).\")\n    print(\"The density of states for photons is g(ε) = (8 * π * ε^2) / (h^3 * c^3), where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\")\n    print(\"u = U/V = ∫ [ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε)] dε from 0 to infinity\")\n    print(\"Performing this integration yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy density.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: To find the entropy density (S/V), we use the thermodynamic relation for a photon gas: S = (4/3) * U / T.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Equilibrium Values ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\nEquilibrium Mean Energy Density (u = U/V):\")\n    # Using explicit numbers as requested by the prompt\n    print(\"The final equation for the mean energy density as a function of temperature T is:\")\n    print(\"u(T) = (8 * π^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * T^4\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo show each number in the final equation:\")\n    print(\"Numerator constant part: 8 * π^5 * k_B^4\")\n    print(\"Denominator constant part: 15 * h^3 * c^3\")\n    print(\"The energy is proportional to the temperature to the power of: 4\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nEquilibrium Entropy Density (s = S/V):\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the entropy density as a function of temperature T is:\")\n    print(\"s(T) = (32 * π^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3)) * T^3\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo show each number in the final equation:\")\n    print(\"Numerator constant part: 32 * π^5 * k_B^4\")\n    print(\"Denominator constant part: 45 * h^3 * c^3\")\n    print(\"The entropy is proportional to the temperature to the power of: 3\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_photon_gas_equilibrium()\n\n```\n<<<u(T) = (8 * π^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * T^4, s(T) = (32 * π^5 * k_B^4 / (45 * h^3 * c^3)) * T^3>>>"
