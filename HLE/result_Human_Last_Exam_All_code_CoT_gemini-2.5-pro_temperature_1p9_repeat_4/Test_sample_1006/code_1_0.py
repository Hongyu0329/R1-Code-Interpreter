    The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact topological space X with two specific properties.

    1.  Let's denote the long ray as R = [0, \u03c9\u2081). Property (1) states that X contains a dense copy of R. This means that X is a compactification of the long ray R.

    2.  Property (2) states that every bounded continuous function f: R -> \u211d extends to a unique continuous function on X. This is the universal mapping property that defines the Stone-\u010cech compactification of R, denoted as \u03b2R. By definition, \u03b2R is the unique (up to homeomorphism) compact Hausdorff space that contains R as a dense subspace and satisfies this extension property.

    3.  Therefore, any space X that fulfills the given conditions must be homeomorphic to \u03b2R.

    4.  Let X_1 and X_2 be two spaces satisfying the given properties. From our reasoning, we have:
        - X_1 is homeomorphic to \u03b2R.
        - X_2 is homeomorphic to \u03b2R.

    5.  Since homeomorphism is an equivalence relation, if X_1 is homeomorphic to \u03b2R and X_2 is homeomorphic to \u03b2R, then X_1 is homeomorphic to X_2.

    6.  This means that all such spaces X belong to the same homeomorphism class.
