    "The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for such a graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the properties of chromatic number.** The chromatic number of a graph on $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n2.  **Relate chromatic number to complete graphs.** A fundamental result in graph theory states that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so all vertices must have a different color.\n3.  **Apply the given constraint.** The problem states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be less than the number of vertices. For $n = 12345$, this means $\\chi(G) < 12345$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n4.  **Check if the upper bound is achievable.** To show that $12344$ is the maximum possible value, we need to demonstrate that there exists a non-complete graph on $12345$ vertices that requires exactly $12344$ colors.\n5.  **Construct an example graph.** Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete graph on $12344$ vertices, which we can call $K_{12344}$. Then add one more vertex, let's call it $v_{12345}$, and do not add any edges connected to it. The resulting graph has $12345$ vertices. It is not complete because $v_{12345}$ is not connected to any other vertex. The subgraph $K_{12344}$ requires $12344$ colors. The extra vertex $v_{12345}$ can be colored with any of these colors, so the entire graph needs exactly $12344$ colors. Another common example is taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge. This graph contains a clique of size $12344$ and thus requires at least $12344$ colors.\n6.  **Conclusion.** Since any non-complete graph with $12345$ vertices needs at most $12344$ colors, and we have found a graph that needs exactly $12344$ colors, the maximum number of colors required is $12344$. The calculation is simply the number of vertices minus one.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that calculates this result and explains the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph\n    with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # A graph G with n vertices has a chromatic number of n if and only if\n    # G is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # Since the graph in the problem is not a complete graph, its chromatic\n    # number must be less than n.\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n    print(\"The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed to color a graph G with 12345 vertices, given it is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"Let n be the number of vertices.\")\n    print(f\"Here, n = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"\\nA graph on n vertices has a chromatic number of n if and only if it is a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"Since G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than n.\")\n    print(f\"This implies the number of colors must be at most n - 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo confirm this is the maximum, we need to show that a graph needing n - 1 colors exists.\")\n    print(\"Consider a graph formed by a complete subgraph on n - 1 vertices (a (n-1)-clique) and one other vertex not connected to all vertices of the clique.\")\n    print(\"Such a graph is not complete, but the (n-1)-clique itself requires n - 1 distinct colors.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is indeed n - 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
