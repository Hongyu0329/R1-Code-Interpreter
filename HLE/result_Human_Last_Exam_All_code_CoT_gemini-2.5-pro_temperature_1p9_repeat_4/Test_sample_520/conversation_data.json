    "This is a historical question. The answer cannot be computed, but I can write a Python script to provide the known historical fact.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Store the true profession of Andre Vernault in a variable.\n2.  Print a sentence that clearly answers the user's question using this variable.\n\n```python\ndef find_true_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reveals the true profession of Andre Vernault.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Andre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed from his interrogators.\n    his_profession = \"a Catholic priest\"\n    \n    # Print the answer in a clear sentence.\n    print(f\"Andre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed from British counterintelligence during World War II, was that of {his_profession}.\")\n    print(\"He feared that if his true profession was known, he would be sent back to occupied Belgium where the clergy were being persecuted.\")\n\nfind_true_profession()\n```\n<<<A Catholic priest>>>"
