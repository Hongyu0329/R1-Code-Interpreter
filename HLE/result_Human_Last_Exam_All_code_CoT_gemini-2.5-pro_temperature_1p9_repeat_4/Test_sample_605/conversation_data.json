    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Crawley-Nordstr√∂m (CN) Invariant:** The CN invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial $F(z_1, ..., z_n) = 0$ in a weighted projective space with weights $(w_1, ..., w_n)$ is given by the formula:\n    $I_{CN} = \\frac{d^{n-1}}{\\prod_{i=1}^n w_i}$\n    where $d$ is the quasi-homogeneous degree of the polynomial and $n$ is the number of variables.\n\n2.  **Identify Weights and Variables:**\n    *   The ambient space is defined by weights: $w = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n    *   There are $n=5$ variables.\n\n3.  **Determine the Degree (d):** A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous with degree $d$ if every monomial adds up to the same degree, where the degree of a monomial $z_1^{e_1} z_2^{e_2} \\cdots z_n^{e_n}$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i w_i$. Let's calculate the degree for each term of the given polynomial $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$:\n    *   Term $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8 \\cdot 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n    *   Term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n    *   Term $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n    *   Term $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $1 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 + 1 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$\n    *   Term $z_2z_3^4$: $1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$\n    *   Term $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n    *   Term $z_5^3$: $3 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$\n    \n    There is a slight discrepancy; one term has a degree of 224 while all others have a degree of 225. This points to a likely typo in the problem's polynomial. We will proceed assuming the polynomial is indeed quasi-homogeneous with the intended degree being $d=225$.\n\n4.  **Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition:** For a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its degree must equal the sum of the weights.\n    *   Sum of weights: $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   Since our assumed degree $d=225$ equals the sum of the weights, the Calabi-Yau condition is met.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Invariant:** Now we plug the values into the formula:\n    *   $d = 225$\n    *   $n = 5$\n    *   $I_{CN} = \\frac{225^{5-1}}{22 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 75} = \\frac{225^4}{117232500}$\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform the calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the weights and the number of variables\nweights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\nn = len(weights)\n\n# The degree 'd' of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface is the sum of its weights.\n# We confirmed this matches the degree of most terms in the polynomial.\nd = sum(weights)\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant: d^(n-1)\nnumerator = d**(n - 1)\n\n# Calculate the denominator: product of all weights\ndenominator = 1\nfor w in weights:\n    denominator *= w\n\n# Calculate the final invariant\ninvariant = numerator / denominator\n\n# To present the full equation, we need the weights as strings\nweights_str = \" * \".join(map(str, weights))\n\n# Print the final result in the requested format\nprint(\"The Crawley-Nordstrom Invariant is calculated as d^(n-1) / (product of weights).\")\nprint(f\"Given weights: ({', '.join(map(str, weights))})\")\nprint(f\"Number of variables (n): {n}\")\nprint(f\"Degree (d = sum of weights): {d}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"CN Invariant = {d}^{n-1} / ({weights_str})\")\nprint(f\"CN Invariant = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"CN Invariant = {invariant}\")\n\n# Simplify the fraction for a more precise representation\n# Use math.gcd to find the greatest common divisor and simplify the fraction.\ncommon_divisor = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\nsimplified_numerator = numerator // common_divisor\nsimplified_denominator = denominator // common_divisor\n\nprint(f\"\\nAs a simplified fraction:\")\nprint(f\"CN Invariant = {simplified_numerator} / {simplified_denominator}\")\n\n# Return the final numerical answer in the specified format\n# The problem asks for the numerical invariant itself.\nfinal_answer = invariant\nprint(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer} >>>\")\n```\n<<<21.861713915239925>>>"
