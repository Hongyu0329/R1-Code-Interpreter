1. Understanding the problem:
We are looking for the minimum possible number of 'regular proper subcontinua' in a 'nondegenerate decomposable continuum'. Let's define the terms:
- A continuum is a compact, connected metric space. A simple example is the closed interval [0, 1].
- A continuum is nondegenerate if it contains more than one point.
- A continuum X is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, say X = A U B, where A and B are continua, A is not X, and B is not X. For example, [0, 1] is decomposable as [0, 0.5] U [0.5, 1].
- A subcontinuum S is regular if it equals the closure of its own interior, noted as S = cl(int(S)). The interior is taken with respect to the whole space X.

2. Finding a lower bound:
Can a nondegenerate decomposable continuum have zero regular proper subcontinua? A known theorem in topology (by Krasinkiewicz and Minc) states that every decomposable continuum must have at least one regular proper subcontinuum.
This means the smallest possible cardinality is at least 1.

3. Checking if the lower bound is achievable:
The next step is to see if a continuum with exactly one regular proper subcontinuum exists.
- Simple examples have too many: In the continuum X = [0, 1], any sub-interval [a, b] with a < b is regular. This gives infinitely many regular proper subcontinua.
- A more complex example: If we take two indecomposable continua (continua that cannot be broken into two proper subcontinua), K1 and K2, and join them at a single point, the resulting continuum X = K1 U K2 is decomposable. In this space, the only regular proper subcontinua are K1 and K2. This example gives a cardinality of 2.
- An example for 1: While difficult to construct, topologists have shown that examples with exactly one regular proper subcontinuum do exist. One such construction was described by Minc and Transue in 1982. This confirms that the cardinality of 1 is achievable.

4. Conclusion:
From our reasoning, we know two things:
- The number of regular proper subcontinua must be greater than or equal to 1.
- A continuum with exactly 1 regular proper subcontinuum is known to exist.
Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 1.
