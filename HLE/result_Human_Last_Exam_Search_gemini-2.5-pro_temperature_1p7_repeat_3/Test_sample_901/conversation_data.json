    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide is an E2 elimination reaction.\n\n1.  **Reactants Analysis:**\n    *   **(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane:** This is the substrate. The (1S,2R) stereochemistry indicates that this is a *cis*-isomer, where the bromine atom and the methyl group are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. In its chair conformations, a *cis*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane has one substituent in an axial position and the other in an equatorial position.\n    *   **Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu):** This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. Its large size influences the regioselectivity of the elimination reaction.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction proceeds via an E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism. This mechanism is a one-step process where the base removes a proton, and the leaving group (bromide) departs simultaneously, forming a double bond.\n    *   A critical requirement for the E2 mechanism in a cyclohexane ring is that the hydrogen to be removed and the leaving group must be in an *anti-periplanar* (or diaxial) arrangement. This means one must be axial up, and the other must be axial down.\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis:**\n    *   The *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as a mixture of two equilibrating chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformation A:** The bromine atom is in the axial position, and the methyl group is in the equatorial position. This conformation is capable of undergoing E2 elimination because the leaving group (Br) is axial.\n    *   **Conformation B:** After a ring flip, the bromine atom is in the equatorial position, and the methyl group is in the axial position. E2 elimination cannot occur from this conformation because the bromine is not axial.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction must proceed through **Conformation A**.\n\n4.  **Regioselectivity (Choice of Product):**\n    *   In Conformation A (with the axial bromine), there are two different types of beta-hydrogens that are also axial and thus *anti-periplanar* to the bromine:\n        *   A hydrogen on carbon-2 (C2), which is adjacent to the methyl group. Removing this hydrogen would lead to the formation of **1-methylcyclohexene**, the more substituted alkene (Zaitsev product).\n        *   A hydrogen on carbon-6 (C6). Removing this hydrogen would lead to the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**, the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product).\n    *   Because potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base, it experiences steric hindrance when trying to access the proton on C2 due to the nearby methyl group. The proton on C6 is much more accessible.\n    *   Consequently, the bulky base preferentially removes the sterically less hindered proton from C6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction is regioselective and, due to the use of a bulky base, favors the formation of the thermodynamically less stable but kinetically favored product. The major product of the reaction is the Hofmann elimination product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
