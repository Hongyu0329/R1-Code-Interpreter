    "### The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval and the unit circle is (π - 1/2) / 2.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance provides a way to measure how far two metric spaces are from being isometric. For the specific case of a line segment and a circle, a precise calculation has been carried out.\n\nThe distance between an interval of length λ, denoted as Iλ, and the unit circle with its intrinsic metric, S¹, depends on the value of λ. According to a study by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is given by two cases:\n*   For 0 ≤ λ ≤ 2π/3, the distance is (π - λ/2) / 2.\n*   For 2π/3 ≤ λ ≤ π, the distance is λ/3.\n\nIn this instance, the interval is, so its length λ is 1. Since 1 falls within the first case (0 ≤ 1 ≤ 2π/3 ≈ 2.09), the applicable formula is (π - λ/2) / 2.\n\nSubstituting λ = 1 into the formula yields:\ndGH(I₁, S¹) = (π - 1/2) / 2\n\nThis result is obtained through the method of correspondences, which involves finding a relation between the two spaces and minimizing the \"distortion\" of the distances under this relation.\n\n<<<1.32079632679>>>"
