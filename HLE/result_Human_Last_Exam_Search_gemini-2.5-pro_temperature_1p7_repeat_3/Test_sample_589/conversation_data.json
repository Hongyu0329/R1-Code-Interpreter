    "The Hollywood feature film that features a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car is the 2007 film *Hot Rod*, produced by Paramount Pictures.\n\nIn the film, the main character, Rod Kimble (played by Andy Samberg), who is an amateur stuntman, performs a stunt where he rides a pink bicycle head-on into a moving car. While Rod is technically a young adult and not a teenager in the movie, the character's immaturity and the nature of the stunt align with the user's description. The scene is played for comedic effect, highlighting Rod's inept but persistent attempts at daredevil feats.\n\nA notable scene in the 1985 film *The Goonies*, produced by Warner Bros., also features a teenager, Brand (played by Josh Brolin), riding a small pink girl's bicycle with training wheels, but he is not riding toward an oncoming car.\n\n<<<Hot Rod (2007)>>>"
