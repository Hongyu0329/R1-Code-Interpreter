    "## \"The Charge at Huj\" Is Latest Depicted Battle in Lady Butler's Work\n\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by the renowned military artist Lady Butler is the \"Charge at Huj,\" which took place on November 8, 1917, during the First World War. The painting, formally titled *\"The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj\"*, immortalizes a cavalry charge against Ottoman and German positions in Palestine.\n\nLady Butler, born Elizabeth Thompson, was famous for her depictions of British military campaigns. While she painted scenes from various conflicts, including the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, her work also extended to the early 20th century.\n\nSeveral of her paintings depict events from World War I. For instance, her work *\"The Retreat from Mons\"* portrays the battle fought on August 23, 1914, and *\"Footballers at Loos\"* captures a moment from the Battle of Loos on September 25, 1915.\n\nAnother of her paintings, *\"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders,\"* completed in 1929, also portrays a scene from the First World War. As the war in Flanders lasted until 1918, it is conceivable that this painting depicts a later event. However, without a specific battle or date identified for this work, the \"Charge at Huj\" remains the latest confirmed historical battle depicted in her portfolio.\n\nOther notable battles painted by Lady Butler include:\n*   **The Battle of Waterloo (1815)**, depicted in *\"Scotland Forever!\"*\n*   **The Battle of Quatre Bras (1815)**, shown in *\"The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras\"*\n*   **The 1842 retreat from Kabul**, in *\"Remnants of an Army\"*\n*   **The Battle of Inkerman (1854)**, the likely subject of *\"The Roll Call\"*\n*   **The Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879)**, depicted in *\"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\"*\n*   **The Battle of Laing's Nek (1881)**, shown in *\"Floreat Etona!\"*\n*   **The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir (1882)**, captured in her painting of the same name.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj"
