For all quintuply, sextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants (up to N-electron excitations), the matrix elements of the form $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero in the case of CCSD. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body interactions, which results in the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian being unable to generate excitations beyond quadruples when acting on the reference determinant.
