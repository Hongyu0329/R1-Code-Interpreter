    "The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot is 3. However, the standard grid number invariant is often defined as the arc index, and the minimal grid diagram for a trefoil has an arc index (or grid number) of 5. There are two distinct trefoil knots, the left-handed and right-handed trefoils, which are mirror images of each other.\n\nThe grid number for a knot K is the minimal number of columns (or rows) in a grid diagram representing K. For the left-hand trefoil knot, the minimal grid number is 5.\n\nTo find the number of distinct minimal grid diagrams, we must consider equivalences up to translation and rotation. A paper by Baldwin, Ozsváth, and Szabó details the enumeration of such diagrams. Specifically, for the trefoil knot (3_1), there are a total of 10 grid diagrams of the minimal size 5. These are split between the left-handed and right-handed versions.\n\nFor the left-hand trefoil knot, there are exactly 2 distinct minimal grid diagrams of size 5, up to rotation and translation.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand trefoil knot has 2 grid diagrams with the minimal grid number when considered up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
