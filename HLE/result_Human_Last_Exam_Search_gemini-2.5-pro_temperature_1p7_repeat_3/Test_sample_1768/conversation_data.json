    "A nucleotide sequence can be translated into a protein in three different reading frames. Since the provided sequence is from the middle of an open reading frame (ORF), the correct frame should not contain any stop codons.\n\nThe three possible forward reading frames are:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Begins with the first nucleotide (`g`ga cat tgt...). Translating this frame reveals a stop codon (`tag`) early in the sequence:\n    *   `GGA CAT TGT TGT TAG...`\n    *   `G  H  C  C  Stop...`\n\n*   **Frame 2:** Begins with the second nucleotide (`g` `gac` `att` `gtt`...). This frame translates into a continuous sequence of amino acids with no stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 3:** Begins with the third nucleotide (`gg` `aca` `ttg` `ttg`...). This frame also contains a stop codon (`tga`):\n    *   `ACA TTG TTG TTA GCG AAG ACT TGA...`\n    *   `T  L  L  L  A  K  T  Stop...`\n\nBecause reading frames 1 and 3 contain premature stop codons, they are not the correct open reading frame. Therefore, the correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n**Reading Frame: 2**\n\n**Protein Sequence: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSSVLAERLEKW**\n\n<<<Frame 2, DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSSVLAERLEKW>>>"
