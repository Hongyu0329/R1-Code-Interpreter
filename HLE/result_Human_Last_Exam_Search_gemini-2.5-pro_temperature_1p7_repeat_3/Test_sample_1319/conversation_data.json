    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Parnassus.\n\nSeveral mountains feature in Homer's epic poem, but Mount Parnassus stands as the highest among them, second only to the mythical abode of the gods, Mount Olympus. The height of Mount Parnassus is 2,457 meters (8,061 feet).\n\nThe *Iliad* also references other notable peaks, including:\n\n*   **Mount Ida in Crete:** This mountain, sacred as the mythical birthplace of Zeus, reaches an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet).\n*   **Mount Ida in Turkey (Anatolia):** From this mountain, near ancient Troy, the gods were said to have observed the Trojan War. Its highest peak is 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n*   **Mount Othrys:** Known in mythology as the base of the Titans, this mountain's highest summit is 1,726 meters (5,663 feet).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain, reputed to be the home of the Centaurs, has a highest peak of 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n\nWhile Mount Ida in Crete is nearly the same height as Mount Parnassus, the latter is slightly taller, making it the highest mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
