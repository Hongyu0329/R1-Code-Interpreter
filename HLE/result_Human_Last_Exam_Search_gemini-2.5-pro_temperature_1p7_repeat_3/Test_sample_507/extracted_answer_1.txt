Persian and Tagalog show striking similarities in the words for "mom" (Māmān/Mama) and "dad" (Bābā/Papa) while having different words for "broom" (Jāru/walis). These languages originate from distinct Asian cultures (Iranian and Filipino) and different language families (Indo-European and Austronesian) with no history of direct contact. The similarity in parental terms is likely a result of the common babbling sounds made by infants.
