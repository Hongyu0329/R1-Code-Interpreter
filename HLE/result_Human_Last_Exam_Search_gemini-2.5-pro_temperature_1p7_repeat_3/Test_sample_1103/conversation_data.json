    "In the context of the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants corresponding to imaginary quadratic fields with a class number of 48 has been determined. Following extensive computational work, it has been established that there are **99** such fundamental discriminants.\n\nThis result is a part of a larger effort to classify all imaginary quadratic fields for small class numbers. The complete determination for class numbers up to 100 was accomplished by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". This work built upon earlier results for smaller class numbers and provided a comprehensive list and count for each class number up to 100.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number has a rich history, with the class number one problem being solved in the mid-20th century. The subsequent extension to higher class numbers required significant computational power and advanced techniques. Watkins' work is considered a major milestone in this area of number theory. While the explicit list of the 99 fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is extensive, the total count has been definitively established through his research.\n\n<<<99>>>"
