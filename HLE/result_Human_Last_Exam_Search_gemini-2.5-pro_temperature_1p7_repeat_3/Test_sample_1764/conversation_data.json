    "It has been established that for any finite ultrametric space $X$ and any infinite-dimensional Banach space $B$, there always exists at least one isometric embedding of $X$ into $B$. This means that in such cases, the number of isometric embeddings is at least 1.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings, considering all possible finite ultrametric spaces and all possible Banach spaces. This includes finite-dimensional Banach spaces.\n\nConsider the case where the Banach space is finite-dimensional. A key result in this area, as stated in multiple sources, is that a finite ultrametric space with $m$ points can be isometrically embedded into the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if $m \\le n+1$. The space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with the Euclidean norm is a Banach space.\n\nTo find the smallest possible number of embeddings, we can select a specific finite ultrametric space $X$ and a specific Banach space $B$ for which this number is minimized.\n\nLet $X$ be a finite set of four points, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$, with the discrete metric where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. This space is ultrametric because for any three distinct points $x_i, x_j, x_k$, the ultrametric inequality $d(x_i, x_j) \\le \\max\\{d(x_i, x_k), d(x_k, x_j)\\}$ holds, as $1 \\le \\max\\{1, 1\\}$.\n\nLet the Banach space $B$ be the 2-dimensional Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^2$, with the standard norm. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the cardinality of the continuum. An isometric embedding would map the four points of $X$ to four points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that are all mutually at a distance of 1 from each other. However, it is a well-known geometric fact that the maximum number of equidistant points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $n+1$. For $\\mathbb{R}^2$, this maximum is 3 (the vertices of an equilateral triangle).\n\nSince our chosen space $X$ has 4 points and our chosen Banach space $B$ is $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (where n=2), and because $4 > 2+1$, it is impossible to isometrically embed $X$ into $B$. Therefore, for this specific choice of $X$ and $B$, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nAs the number of embeddings cannot be a negative number, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space into a Banach space is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
