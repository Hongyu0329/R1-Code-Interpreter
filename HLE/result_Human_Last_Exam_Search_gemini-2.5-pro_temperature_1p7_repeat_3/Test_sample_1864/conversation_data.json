    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a minimum of **12 essential controls** for a robust and accurate experiment. These controls are crucial for setting up the instrument, compensating for spectral overlap, and accurately identifying and sorting your target cell population.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls and their purpose:\n\n### 1. Unstained Controls (2 tubes)\n*   **Unstained Cells (1 tube):** This control consists of your cells without any fluorescent labels. It is essential to determine the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population and to set the initial voltage settings on the flow cytometer.\n*   **Unstained Streptavidin Beads (1 tube):** This control contains only the streptavidin beads. It is necessary to assess the autofluorescence of the beads themselves across all five detection channels.\n\n### 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes)\nFor any multicolor flow cytometry experiment, single-stain controls are absolutely essential to correct for spectral overlap, which is the spillover of a fluorophore's emission into a detector that is not its primary one. You will need one single-stain control for each fluorophore in your panel. These can be prepared using either your cells or compensation beads, but they must be as bright or brighter than your experimental samples.\n*   **AF350 single stain (1 tube)**\n*   **GFP single stain (1 tube)**\n*   **PE single stain (1 tube)**\n*   **AF647 single stain (1 tube)**\n*   **AF750 single stain (1 tube)**\n\n### 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes)\nFMO controls are critical for accurate gating, especially in a sorting experiment where the purity of the sorted population is paramount. An FMO control includes all the fluorophores in your panel except for one. This allows you to visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other channels into the \"empty\" channel, helping you to set a precise gate for what is truly a positive signal. For a new or complex multicolor panel, it is recommended to prepare an FMO control for each channel.\n*   **AF350 FMO (1 tube):** Stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **GFP FMO (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **PE FMO (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **AF647 FMO (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750.\n*   **AF750 FMO (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647.\n\n### Other Important Considerations:\n*   **Viability Dye:** It is highly recommended to include a viability dye to exclude dead cells, which can non-specifically bind antibodies and exhibit high autofluorescence. If your viability dye is one of the five listed fluorophores, its single-stain control will serve as the necessary compensation control. If you use a sixth dye for viability, you will need an additional single-stain control for it.\n*   **Isotype Controls:** The use of isotype controls is a topic of debate in the field. While they can help to assess non-specific binding due to the antibody's Fc region, FMO controls are generally considered more appropriate for setting gates in multicolor experiments.\n\nIn summary, preparing these 12 controls will provide you with the necessary information to properly set up your sorter, compensate your data correctly, and confidently identify your target population for a successful sorting experiment.\n\n<<<12>>>"
