    "The minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of faces of its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 equilateral triangles. Since the faces of the convex hull are already triangles, no further division is necessary for triangulation. Therefore, the number of visible triangles from the outside is simply the number of faces of the regular icosahedron.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
