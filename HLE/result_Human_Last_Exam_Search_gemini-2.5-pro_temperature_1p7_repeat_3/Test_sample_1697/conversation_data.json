    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis transformation occurs via a process known as directed ortho-metalation (DoM). Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Directed ortho-Metalation (Deprotonation):**\n    *   The starting molecule has two functional groups that can direct the lithiation: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt2) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe2).\n    *   The tertiary amide group is a significantly stronger directing metalation group (DMG) than the tertiary amine group. Both groups direct the metalation to the C2 position, which is the carbon atom located between them. This cooperative effect makes the hydrogen at the C2 position the most acidic and therefore the most readily removed.\n    *   sec-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi) is a very strong base used to deprotonate weak carbon acids. TMEDA is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion, increasing the basicity and reactivity of the sec-BuLi.\n    *   The sec-BuLi, activated by TMEDA, selectively removes the proton from the C2 position, forming a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench (Methylation):**\n    *   The resulting aryllithium species is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   When methyl iodide (CH3I) is added to the solution, the nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group of the methyl iodide.\n    *   This attack displaces the iodide ion and forms a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching the methyl group to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe final compound obtained is therefore N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
