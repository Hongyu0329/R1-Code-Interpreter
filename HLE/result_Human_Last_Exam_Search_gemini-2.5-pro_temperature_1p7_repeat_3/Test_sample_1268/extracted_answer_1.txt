The upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\|f\|_\infty$, of a Hecke-Maass newform for a squarefree natural number $N$ in relation to the covolume $V$ is given by $\|f\|_\infty \ll_{\epsilon} \lambda^{5/24+\epsilon} V^{1/3+\epsilon}$, where $\lambda$ is the Laplace eigenvalue and $\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant.
