    "An upper bound for the maximum norm of Hecke-Maass newforms in relation to the covolume for squarefree levels has been a significant area of research in number theory. Let $f$ be a Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform of square-free level $N$ with Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The space on which these forms are defined is the modular surface $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half-plane and $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is a congruence subgroup of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe covolume $V$ of this space is given by $V = \\text{vol}(Y_0(N)) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$. For a squarefree natural number $N$, the covolume $V$ is directly proportional to $N$.\n\nThe maximum norm, or sup-norm, of such a form, denoted by $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, is the maximum value $|f(z)|$ for $z \\in Y_0(N)$. The form $f$ is typically normalized to have an $L^2$-norm of 1.\n\nThe relationship between the maximum norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, the eigenvalue $\\lambda$, and the level $N$ (and thus the covolume $V$) is expressed through various bounds. A \"trivial\" bound can be established as $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll N^{1/2+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$, where the form is $L^2$-normalized with respect to a measure that gives the space a volume of 1.\n\nHowever, significant improvements over this trivial bound have been achieved. For a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ of square-free level $N$ and eigenvalue $\\lambda$, which is $L^2$-normalized to 1, the best currently known upper bound is a hybrid one that incorporates both the eigenvalue and the level. This bound was established by Nicolas Templier and is given by:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nSince the covolume $V$ is proportional to $N$ for squarefree $N$, we can express this bound in terms of $V$ as:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis inequality represents the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume for squarefree levels. The exponent $1/3$ for the level $N$ (and consequently for the covolume $V$) is the best known result to date for squarefree levels.\n\nIf the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is considered to be fixed (the \"level aspect\"), the bound simplifies to $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$, or in terms of the covolume, $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, of a Hecke-Maass newform for a squarefree natural number $N$ in relation to the covolume $V$ is given by $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$, where $\\lambda$ is the Laplace eigenvalue and $\\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant.>>>"
