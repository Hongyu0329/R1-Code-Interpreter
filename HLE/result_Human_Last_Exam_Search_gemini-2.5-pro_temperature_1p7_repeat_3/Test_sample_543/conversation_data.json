    "### Final Product Named 1,2,3-Triphenylbenzene\n\nThe reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nIn this Grignard reaction, the phenyl group (C₆H₅) from the phenyl magnesium bromide acts as a nucleophile, replacing the halogen atoms on the benzene ring. The reactivity of halogens in such aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions generally follows the order: I > Br > Cl > F. This is because the carbon-iodine bond is the weakest, making iodide the best leaving group.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in a stepwise manner:\n1.  The iodine atom at the 2-position is the most reactive and is replaced first by a phenyl group.\n2.  Given the \"excess\" amount of phenyl magnesium bromide and the energy supplied by refluxing, the two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 are subsequently replaced by phenyl groups.\n\nThe final product is a central benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature, this compound is named 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. The aqueous work-up step is crucial for quenching any unreacted Grignard reagent and neutralizing the magnesium halide byproducts formed during the reaction.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
