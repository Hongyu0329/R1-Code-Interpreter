    "There is no credible information available to confirm that two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n\nExtensive searches for \"Enron 'Ask Why' commercial Nobel laureates 2000,\" \"two Nobel laureates in 2000 Enron commercial,\" \"who starred in Enron 'Ask Why' commercial,\" \"academics in Enron 2000 commercial,\" and \"'Nobel laureates' in Enron 'Ask Why' commercial\" have yielded no evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe search results do contain information about Enron's \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign, its subsequent bankruptcy, and various individuals associated with the company. There are also mentions of Nobel laureates in the context of economic theories related to the scandal and, ironically, Enron's executives being awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for \"Most Creative Use of Imaginary Numbers\". However, no sources substantiate the presence of any Nobel laureates as actors or spokespeople in their television commercials.\n\nIt is possible that this is a misconception or a conflation of different pieces of information surrounding the Enron scandal.\n\n<<<There is no evidence that any Nobel laureates were featured in the 2000 Enron commercial.>>>"
