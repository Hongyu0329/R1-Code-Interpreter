    "Despite a thorough search for a video of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote*, a complete and accessible video of the Act I variation from that specific year is not available online. Numerous search results title a 2008 performance but lead to unavailable content or broken links.\n\nWhile reviews from the time confirm her performance and praise her technical skill in turning and jumping, they do not provide a specific count of the pirouettes in the Act I variation. Choreography, including the number of pirouettes, can differ between productions and even from one performance to another, making it impossible to give a precise number without visual confirmation of the 2008 performance.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008 cannot be determined from the available information.\n\n<<<Unable to answer>>>"
