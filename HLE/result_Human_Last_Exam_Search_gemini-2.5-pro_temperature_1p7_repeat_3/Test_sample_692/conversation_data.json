    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in an aboriginal writing system is December 8, 36 BCE. This date was found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The inscription is in the form of the Maya Long Count calendar, although it is considered to be an epi-Olmec or Isthmian script rather than Mayan.\n\nBefore this discovery, it was believed that the earliest recorded date was on a Zapotec monument known as \"Danzante\" Stone (Monument 3) in San José Mogote, Oaxaca, with a suggested date of 500-600 BCE. However, the dating of this monument has been questioned, with some scholars suggesting it may have been reused. Other Zapotec monuments, Stelae 12 and 13 from Monte Albán, are provisionally dated to 500-400 BCE and are thought to show one of the earliest calendric representations in Mesoamerica. The glyphs on the San José Mogote Danzante are believed to possibly represent a calendar day-name, \"1 Earthquake\".\n\nWhile the Olmec civilization is credited with having the earliest writing system in Mesoamerica, with some artifacts dating to around 650 BCE, these do not contain a specific recorded calendar date. An Olmec cylinder seal from around 650 BCE has glyphs that some researchers interpret as \"King 3 Ajaw,\" which is a day in the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. However, this interpretation is debated.\n\nTherefore, the most definitively dated and widely accepted earliest recorded date is from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo. The fragmented inscription on the stela has been reconstructed to represent the Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13, which corresponds to December 8, 36 BCE.\n\n<<<December 8, 36 BCE>>>"
