    "The Beatles song that begins with a distinctive chord jump from the tonic to a non-diatonic minor chord is **\"Yesterday\"**.\n\nWritten by Paul McCartney, \"Yesterday\" is in the key of F major. The song famously opens with an acoustic guitar playing an F major chord (the tonic, or I chord), immediately followed by an E minor 7th chord (Em7).\n\nWhile the E minor 7th is not technically a \"minor fifth\" chord in the key of F (which would be a C minor chord), it functions as an unexpected and harmonically sophisticated shift to a minor quality chord right at the start of the song. This initial chord change is a key element of the song's melancholic and memorable character. The E minor 7th chord acts as a leading-tone chord that resolves to the A7 chord, which in turn leads to D minor, the relative minor of F major. This progression (I - viiÂ°7/vi - V7/vi - vi) is a notable example of the Beatles' innovative use of harmony.\n\nOther Beatles songs feature unusual chord progressions and the use of non-diatonic chords. For instance, \"From Me To You\" includes a minor dominant chord, but this appears in the bridge section rather than at the very beginning of the song. The striking opening of \"Yesterday\" with the direct move from a major tonic to an unexpected minor chord makes it the most fitting answer to your query.\n\n<<<Yesterday>>>"
