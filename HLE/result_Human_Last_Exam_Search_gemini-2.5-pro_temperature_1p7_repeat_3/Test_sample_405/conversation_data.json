    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear colorless, white, or yellowish. Impure white phosphorus is often called yellow phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus has a deep red color, though its appearance can range from reddish-violet to a dark red-purple. It can also exhibit an iron-grey luster.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is typically violet or has a red-purple hue. It has been described as appearing as yellowish-red translucent plates and can have a steely blue luster. When ground into a very fine powder, it can look red.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most stable form of phosphorus and, as its name suggests, is black and flaky with an appearance similar to graphite.\n\nA more recently synthesized form is blue phosphorus, a two-dimensional material. As implied by its name, this allotrope is blue.\n\nTherefore, the observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are white/yellow, red, violet/purple, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5>>>"
