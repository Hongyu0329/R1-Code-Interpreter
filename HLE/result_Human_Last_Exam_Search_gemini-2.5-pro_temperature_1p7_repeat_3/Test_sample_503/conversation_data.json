    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, the left adjoint $L: \\to$ and the right adjoint $R: \\to$. The objects $[n]$ in this category are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nFor an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all joins (suprema). In a finite ordinal $[m]$, the join of any subset is its maximum element, and the join of the empty set is the bottom element, 0. For $L$ to preserve joins, two conditions must be met:\n1. For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, $L(\\max(S)) = \\max(L(S))$. This is automatically satisfied by any order-preserving map.\n2. For the empty set, $L(\\sup(\\emptyset)) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))$. This means $L(0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it satisfies the condition $L(0) = 0$.\n\nEach such left adjoint $L$ uniquely determines the right adjoint $R$ and hence the entire adjunction. Thus, the number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$ is the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is a non-decreasing sequence of 24 integers:\n$L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$\nsuch that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first element of the sequence. We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23:\n$L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$\nwhere each element is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic stars and bars problem. We are choosing 23 numbers from a set of $37+1=38$ possibilities, with replacement, and the order in which we choose them does not matter as they will be arranged into a non-decreasing sequence. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, where $k=23$ is the number of items to choose and $n=38$ is the number of categories to choose from.\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps from $[23-1]=$ to $$, which is given by the formula $\\binom{n+m+1}{m}$ with $m=22$ and $n=37$, or by the formula $\\binom{n+m}{m}$ for maps from $[m-1]$ to $[n]$.\nLet's use the latter general formula for the number of order-preserving maps from $[m]$ to $[n]$ with the condition $L(0)=0$. This count is $\\binom{n+m}{m}$.\n\nFor this problem, $m=23$ and $n=37$. The number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$\n\nThis can be calculated as:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!}$\n\nThe numerical value is $54,627,305,641,434,340$.\n\n<<<54627305641434340>>>"
