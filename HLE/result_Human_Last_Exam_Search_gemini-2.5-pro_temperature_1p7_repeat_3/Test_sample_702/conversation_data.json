    "Answering this question requires delving into the concepts of algebraic topology, specifically concerning loop spaces, smash products, suspensions, and the connectivity of maps.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Map and Spaces\n\nFirst, let's identify the spaces and the map in question:\n*   **$S^n$**: The n-dimensional sphere.\n*   **$\\Omega X$**: The based loop space of a pointed topological space X. Its homotopy groups are given by $\\pi_k(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(X)$.\n*   **$\\Sigma X$**: The reduced suspension of a pointed space X. Its homotopy groups are related by the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(\\Sigma X)$ in a certain range.\n*   **$X \\wedge Y$**: The smash product of two pointed spaces X and Y. For spheres, $S^m \\wedge S^n$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{m+n}$.\n\nThe map is given as:\n$f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n\nUsing the sphere equivalence, we can simplify the target space:\n$\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$\n\nSo the map is $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$. The question mentions this map is \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers,\" which points towards its natural construction in homotopy theory. This map is the (left) adjoint of a natural pairing between loop spaces. The adjunction between suspension ($\\Sigma$) and loop space ($\\Omega$) functors states that there is a natural bijection of homotopy classes of maps: $[\\Sigma A, B] \\cong [A, \\Omega B]$.\n\nApplying this adjunction, our map $f$ corresponds to an adjoint map:\n$f': \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\Omega^2 S^{10}$\n\nThe connectivity of $f$ is the same as the connectivity of its adjoint map $f'$.\n\n### 2. Connectivity of the Spaces\n\nThe connectivity of a map is determined by comparing the homotopy groups of the source and target spaces. A map $g: A \\to B$ is **k-connected** if the induced map on homotopy groups, $g_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$. This is equivalent to the condition that the homotopy fiber of the map is $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nLet's determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain of $f'$.\n\n**Domain: $A = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$**\n*   The 4-sphere, $S^4$, is 3-connected ($\\pi_i(S^4) = 0$ for $i<4$). The loop space $\\Omega S^4$ is therefore 2-connected, with its first non-trivial homotopy group being $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The 6-sphere, $S^6$, is 5-connected ($\\pi_i(S^6) = 0$ for $i<6$). The loop space $\\Omega S^6$ is therefore 4-connected, with its first non-trivial homotopy group being $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   According to the Hurewicz theorem and the Künneth formula for homology, the first non-trivial homology group of a smash product of two spaces occurs at the sum of the dimensions of the first non-trivial homology groups of the individual spaces. The first non-trivial homology for $\\Omega S^4$ is $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and for $\\Omega S^6$ it is $H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   Thus, the first non-trivial homology group of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is in degree $3+5=8$. By the Hurewicz theorem, this implies that the space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is **7-connected**. The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Codomain: $B = \\Omega^2 S^{10}$**\n*   The 10-sphere, $S^{10}$, is 9-connected.\n*   The double loop space $\\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is therefore $(9-2) = \\textbf{7-connected}$.\n*   Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### 3. Connectivity of the Map\n\nBoth the domain and codomain of the adjoint map $f'$ are 7-connected. This means that for $i < 8$, $\\pi_i(A) = \\pi_i(B) = 0$, so the induced map is an isomorphism (of trivial groups). Let's examine the map on the first non-trivial homotopy groups in degree 8:\n\n$f'_*: \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$\n\nThis is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. The natural map $f'$ is known in homotopy theory to induce an isomorphism on the lowest-degree non-trivial homotopy group. This means $f'_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_8$.\n\nNow, we return to the original map $f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   **Domain of $f$**: Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, its suspension $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is **8-connected**. The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Codomain of $f$**: $\\Omega S^{10}$ is also **8-connected**. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's check the connectivity of $f$:\n*   For $i<9$, $\\pi_i$ of both the domain and codomain are trivial, so $f_*$ is an isomorphism. This means the map is at least 9-connected.\n*   For $i=9$, the map is $f_*: \\pi_9(\\text{Domain}) \\to \\pi_9(\\text{Codomain})$, which corresponds to $f'_*$ on $\\pi_8$, and is therefore an isomorphism $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. Since an isomorphism is also a surjection, the condition for being 9-connected is satisfied.\n*   For a map to be 10-connected, $f_*$ must be an isomorphism for $i<10$. Since it is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$, this holds. So the map is at least 10-connected.\n*   For the map to be 10-connected, we also require $f_*: \\pi_{10}(\\text{Domain}) \\to \\pi_{10}(\\text{Codomain})$ to be a surjection. Let's look at these groups:\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(\\text{Domain}) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(\\text{Codomain}) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. From tables of homotopy groups of spheres, we know $\\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The group $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is more complex, but a calculation using the Künneth formula and the Hurewicz theorem shows that its homology counterpart $H_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. It is a standard result that the map $f'_*$ on this level is a surjection.\n\n*   To be 11-connected, the map $f_*$ on $\\pi_{10}$ would need to be an isomorphism. However, the source group $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is not isomorphic to the target group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, the map cannot be 11-connected.\n\nBased on this analysis, the map is surjective on $\\pi_{10}$ but not an isomorphism.\n\nFinal conclusion: The map is an isomorphism on homotopy groups up to degree 9, and surjective in degree 10, but not an isomorphism in degree 10. This makes the map 10-connected.\n\n<<<10>>>"
