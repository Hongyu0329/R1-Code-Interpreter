The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is defined by the Berezin integration rules: for a single Grassmann variable \( \theta \), the integral of a constant is zero (\( \int d\theta \cdot 1 = 0 \)) and the integral of the variable itself is one (\( \int d\theta \cdot \theta = 1 \)). These rules are built upon the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables (\( \theta_i \theta_j = - \theta_j \theta_i \)), which directly leads to their nilpotency (\( \theta_i^2 = 0 \)), the mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle in this formalism.
