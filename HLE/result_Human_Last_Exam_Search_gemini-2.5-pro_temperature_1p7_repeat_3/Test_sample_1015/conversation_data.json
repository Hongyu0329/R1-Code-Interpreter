    "A notable distinction between a cambré derrière (a bend of the upper body backward) in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods lies in the placement of the hip. This difference is most evident when the cambré is executed in conjunction with an arabesque.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso, with the hips remaining aligned with the shoulders. The backbend in a cambré derrière originates from the upper and middle back, while the hips are kept as level as possible to preserve a classical line.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method allows for greater freedom in the hips. A key characteristic of the Balanchine arabesque, and by extension a cambré derrière, is the permission for the hip of the working leg to lift and open towards the audience. This creates the illusion of a longer line and is a signature element of the Balanchine style.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement, speed, and head placement can also differ between the two techniques, the approach to hip placement in a cambré derrière is a fundamental and defining point of divergence. The Balanchine style's allowance for an open hip contrasts sharply with the Vaganova method's strict adherence to squared hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
