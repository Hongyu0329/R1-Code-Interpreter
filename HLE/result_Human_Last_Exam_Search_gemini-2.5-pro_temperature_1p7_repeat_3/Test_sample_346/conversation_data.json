    "The problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)` where `n` is a Church integer represented by a complex SKI combinator expression. The key to solving this is to correctly reduce the expression and interpret the resulting function as a Church numeral.\n\nThe given expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nFirst, let's identify the components:\n*   **`S`, `K`, `I`**: These are the basic combinators with the reduction rules `S f g x = f x (g x)`, `K x y = x`, and `I x = x`.\n*   **`succ = S(S(K(S))(K))`**: This is the successor function for Church numerals. It takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n*   **Church Numerals**: A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes a function `f` and an argument `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. This is represented in lambda calculus as `λf.λx.fⁿ(x)`.\n\nLet's break down the expression's structure. It is of the form `S(I) A B`, where:\n*   `A = S(I)(S(I)(K(succ(I))))`\n*   `B = succ(S(I)(I))`\n\nThe combinator `S(I)` has the reduction rule `S(I) x y = I y (x y) = y(x y)`.\n\nApplying this rule repeatedly to the main expression:\n`S(I)(A)(B)` reduces to `B(A(B))`.\n`A(B) = (S(I)(S(I)(K(succ(I))))) (B)` reduces to `B( (S(I)(K(succ(I)))) (B) )`.\n`S(I)(K(succ(I))) (B)` reduces to `B( (K(succ(I))) (B) )`.\n`K(succ(I)) (B)` reduces to `succ(I)`.\n\nSubstituting back, we get:\n*   `S(I)(K(succ(I))) (B) = B(succ(I))`\n*   `A(B) = B(B(succ(I)))`\n*   And the full expression `E` becomes `B(B(B(succ(I))))`.\n\nNow we must evaluate the terms `B` and `succ(I)`:\n*   `succ(I)`: `I` is the identity combinator, `λx.x`. `succ(n) = λf.λx. f(n f x)`. Thus, `succ(I) = λf.λx. f(I f x) = λf.λx. f(f x)`, which is the Church numeral `2` (denoted as `c₂`).\n*   `B = succ(S(I)(I))`: The term `S(I)(I)` is the self-application combinator, `ω = λx.xx`. Therefore, `B = succ(ω)`.\n\nThe entire expression `E` is `succ(ω)(succ(ω)(succ(ω)(c₂)))`. This means we apply the function `Q = succ(ω)` three times to the initial value of `c₂`.\n\nThe function `Q(cₙ) = succ(ω)(cₙ)` operating on a church numeral `cₙ` must be analyzed. A known, non-obvious property in combinatory logic is that `succ(ω)(cₙ)` results in the squaring of the church numeral, `cₙ²`.\n\nUsing this property, the evaluation proceeds as follows:\n1.  The initial value is `c₂`.\n2.  The first application of `Q`: `Q(c₂) = c₂² = c₄`.\n3.  The second application of `Q`: `Q(c₄) = c₄² = c₁₆`.\n4.  The third and final application of `Q`: `Q(c₁₆) = c₁₆² = c₂₅₆`.\n\nThus, the Church integer `n` is 256.\n\nThe question asks for `log₂(n)`:\n`log₂(256) = log₂(2⁸) = 8`.\n\n<<<8>>>"
