    "An analysis of the starting and ending leg positions for each of the classical ballet steps reveals the following:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. A dancer starting in fifth position with the right foot in front will finish in fifth position with the left foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** \"Échappé\" means to escape, typically from a closed position like fifth to an open one and back. \"Battu\" indicates a beat of the legs. \"Changé\" means changed, which signifies that the feet change positions from front to back. Thus, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The name of this step means \"to assemble.\" An assemblé begins in fifth position, the legs are brought together in the air, and the dancer lands back in fifth position. The fundamental execution of this step has the dancer returning to the original starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a gliding step. In a \"glissade derrière,\" the step begins with the back foot and ends with the same foot in the back. Although the configuration of the feet is the same, a glissade is a traveling step, meaning the dancer moves across the floor, so their overall position in space changes.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step resembling a pas de chat, where each leg performs a rond de jambe (circular movement) while in the air. A dancer begins in fifth position, and after the jump and leg circles, lands and closes into fifth position. However, due to the intricate and embellished nature of the movement, returning to the precise starting position is not its defining characteristic as it is for an assemblé.\n\nBased on the definitions, the assemblé is the step where the primary goal is to return to the same starting position.\n\n<<<C>>>"
