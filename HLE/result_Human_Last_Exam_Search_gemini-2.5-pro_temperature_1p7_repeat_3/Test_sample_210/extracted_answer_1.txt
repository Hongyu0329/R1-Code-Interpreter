Between 1803 and 1823, there is no specific record of the number of destitute migrants who settled on Colonel Thomas Talbot's land grant; however, by 1826, the total number of settlers had reached approximately 20,000. Colonel Talbot's original land grant was 5,000 acres, and by 1821 his personal holdings had grown to over 65,000 acres, making the acreage he claimed more than 60,000 acres larger than the original grant.
