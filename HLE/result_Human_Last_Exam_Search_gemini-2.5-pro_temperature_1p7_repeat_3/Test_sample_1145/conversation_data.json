    "To determine the probability of finding the particle in the 1D box within the specified interval, we must integrate the probability density function over this range.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' for a given quantum state 'n' is:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the wave function:\nP(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n\nWe are given the quantum state n = 2, and the interval is from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a. The probability (Prob) is the integral of the probability density over this interval:\nProb = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ᵃ (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1/2)(1 - cos(2θ)).  Here, θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral gives:\nProb = (2/a) ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ᵃ (1/2) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\nProb = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\nProb = (1/a) [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π * 0.505a / a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π * 0.495a / a)) ]\nProb = (1/a) [ (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nProb = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity sin(A) - sin(B) = 2cos((A+B)/2)sin((A-B)/2), with A=2.02π and B=1.98π, we get:\nsin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π) = 2cos(2π)sin(0.02π) = 2sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstituting this back into our probability equation:\nProb = 0.01 - (1/4π)(2sin(0.02π))\nProb = 0.01 - (1/(2π))sin(0.02π)\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\nsin(0.02π) ≈ sin(0.06283) ≈ 0.06279\nProb ≈ 0.01 - (0.06279 / (2 * 3.14159))\nProb ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099934\nProb ≈ 0.0000066\n\nThe interval is centered around x = 0.5a, which is a node for the n=2 state (the wave function is zero). Consequently, the probability of finding the particle in this small interval around the node is very low.\n\n<<<0.00000659>>>"
