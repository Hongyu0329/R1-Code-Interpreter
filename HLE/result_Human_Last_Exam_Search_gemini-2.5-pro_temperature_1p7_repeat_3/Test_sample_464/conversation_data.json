    "Yes, it follows that $f = 0$. Here is the reasoning behind this conclusion.\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. The defining characteristic of a Schwartz function is that the function itself and all of its derivatives decay faster than any inverse power of $|x|$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. The condition given is that all moments of the function are zero, which is expressed as:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in analyzing the Fourier transform of the function $f$. The Fourier transform of $f$, denoted by $\\hat{f}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx\n$$\n\nA key property of Schwartz functions is that their Fourier transforms are also Schwartz functions. Since $\\hat{f}$ is infinitely differentiable, we can compute its derivatives. Differentiating under the integral sign (which is permissible for Schwartz functions), the $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx\n$$\n\nEvaluating these derivatives at the origin ($\\xi = 0$) gives:\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx\n$$\n\nAccording to the initial assumption, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. This directly implies that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nSo, we have a function $\\hat{f}$ which is a Schwartz function and all of its derivatives at the origin are zero.\n\nA fundamental result from complex analysis, related to the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem, states that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function can be extended to an entire function on the complex plane. This means there exists an analytic function $F(z)$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that its restriction to the real axis is $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$.\n\nBecause $F(z)$ is an entire function, it is equal to its Taylor series expansion around any point. Let's consider the Taylor series around $z=0$:\n$$\nF(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{F^{(k)}(0)}{k!} z^k\n$$\nThe coefficients of this series are determined by the derivatives of $F$ at the origin, which are the same as the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin. As we have shown that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$, all the coefficients of the Taylor series are zero.\n\nThis means that $F(z)$ is identically zero for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Consequently, its restriction to the real axis, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, must also be identically zero.\n\nFinally, the Fourier transform is an invertible operation on the space of Schwartz functions. This means that if $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$, then the function $f(x)$ must itself be the zero function. This can be seen from the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$\nf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = 0\n$$\n\nTherefore, if a Schwartz function $f$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function. It is worth noting that this conclusion does not hold for more general classes of functions, such as $C^\\infty$ functions that are not in the Schwartz class.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
