    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we first need to analyze the conductor $d$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $d=53599$.\nThe prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet the prime factors be $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$. Since $d$ is a square-free integer, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2\\chi_3\\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if none of the component characters $\\chi_i$ are the principal (trivial) character.\n\n### Step 2: Character Group Structure\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n*   For $p_1=7$, the group is cyclic of order $7-1=6$.\n*   For $p_2=13$, the group is cyclic of order $13-1=12$.\n*   For $p_3=19$, the group is cyclic of order $19-1=18$.\n*   For $p_4=31$, the group is cyclic of order $31-1=30$.\n\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$. We require this order to be 6.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of order 6:\n1.  Each $\\chi_i$ must be a non-trivial character (order $>1$).\n2.  The orders of the components, $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must divide 6. This means $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$. This is possible because for each prime factor $p_i$, $p_i-1$ is divisible by 6.\n3.  The least common multiple of these orders must be 6.\n\nLet $N_{prim}(k)$ be the number of primitive characters of order $k$. We can find this by considering the number of primitive characters whose order divides a given number. Let $P(m)$ be the number of primitive characters with order dividing $m$. A primitive character has order dividing $m$ if and only if each of its non-trivial components has an order dividing $m$.\n\nThe number of characters modulo $p_i$ with order dividing $m$ is $\\gcd(m, p_i-1)$. The number of non-trivial characters with order dividing $m$ is $\\gcd(m, p_i-1)-1$.\nTherefore, $P(m) = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} (\\gcd(m, p_i-1) - 1)$.\n\n*   The number of primitive characters whose order divides 6 is:\n    $P(6) = (\\gcd(6,6)-1)(\\gcd(6,12)-1)(\\gcd(6,18)-1)(\\gcd(6,30)-1) = (6-1)(6-1)(6-1)(6-1) = 5^4 = 625$.\n    These characters can have order 2, 3, or 6.\n\n*   The number of primitive characters whose order divides 3 is:\n    $P(3) = (\\gcd(3,6)-1)(\\gcd(3,12)-1)(\\gcd(3,18)-1)(\\gcd(3,30)-1) = (3-1)(3-1)(3-1)(3-1) = 2^4 = 16$.\n    These are the primitive characters of order 3, so $N_{prim}(3) = 16$.\n\n*   The number of primitive characters whose order divides 2 is:\n    $P(2) = (\\gcd(2,6)-1)(\\gcd(2,12)-1)(\\gcd(2,18)-1)(\\gcd(2,30)-1) = (2-1)(2-1)(2-1)(2-1) = 1^4 = 1$.\n    This is the number of primitive characters of order 2, so $N_{prim}(2) = 1$.\n\nThe set of primitive characters with order dividing 6 is the disjoint union of the sets of primitive characters of order 2, 3, and 6. Therefore:\n$P(6) = N_{prim}(2) + N_{prim}(3) + N_{prim}(6)$.\n\nWe want to find $N_{prim}(6)$:\n$N_{prim}(6) = P(6) - N_{prim}(2) - N_{prim}(3) = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n"
