    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **Toluene Composition**: The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8, meaning it is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) Atom Basis Functions**: For each carbon atom, the 6-31G basis set specifies:\n    *   One contracted function for the 1s core orbital.\n    *   Two contracted functions for the 2s valence orbital.\n    *   Two contracted functions for each of the three 2p valence orbitals (px, py, pz).\n    *   This results in a total of 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted functions per carbon atom**.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H) Atom Basis Functions**: For each hydrogen atom, which only has a 1s orbital, the 6-31G basis set specifies:\n    *   Two contracted functions for the 1s valence orbital.\n    *   This gives a total of **2 contracted functions per hydrogen atom**.\n\n*   **Total Calculation**:\n    *   The 7 carbon atoms contribute: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n    *   The 8 hydrogen atoms contribute: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n    *   The sum for the entire toluene molecule is 63 + 16 = **79 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n<<<79>>>"
