    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is determined through the epsilon expansion. This expansion is carried out in terms of the small parameter ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the number of spatial dimensions. The behavior of the coupling constant under changes in the energy scale is described by the beta function, β(u).\n\nTo the leading order in both the coupling constant u and ϵ, the beta function is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\n\nHere, the term -ϵu arises from the classical scaling of the coupling constant, and the term Bu² is the one-loop quantum correction. The constant B depends on the specific conventions used for defining the coupling constant. A commonly used normalization in many field theory textbooks gives B = (3 / (16π²)).\n\nA fixed point of the theory is a value of the coupling u* for which the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale (β(u*) = 0). Apart from the trivial \"Gaussian\" fixed point at u* = 0, there exists a non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nSetting the beta function to zero to find the Wilson-Fisher fixed point yields:\n\n-ϵu* + B(u*)² = 0\n\nSolving for the non-zero value of u* gives the leading order expression:\n\nu* = ϵ / B\n\nUsing the common normalization where B = (3 / (16π²)), the fixed point coupling is:\n\nu* = (16π²/3)ϵ\n\nThis result shows that the fixed point coupling is of order ϵ, which justifies the use of perturbation theory in the epsilon expansion for small ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ϵ>>>"
