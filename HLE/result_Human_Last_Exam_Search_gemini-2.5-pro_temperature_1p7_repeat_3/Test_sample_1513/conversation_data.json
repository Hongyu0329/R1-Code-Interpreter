    "The island town that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name, and is located more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, is Hanga Roa on Easter Island.\n\nEaster Island, a special territory of Chile located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, which is approximately 2,075 kilometers away.\n\nThe island's main town and harbor is named Hanga Roa, which translates to \"Long Bay\" or \"Wide Bay\" in the Rapa Nui language. The town is situated on the west coast of the island, in the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau.\n\nEaster Island itself is of volcanic origin, primarily formed by three extinct coalesced volcanoes. One of these, Rano Kau, located at the southwestern end of the island next to Hanga Roa, has a large, circular, water-filled crater, which is a volcanic caldera. While the town of Hanga Roa lies on the coastal plain, it is situated next to this significant volcanic feature.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
