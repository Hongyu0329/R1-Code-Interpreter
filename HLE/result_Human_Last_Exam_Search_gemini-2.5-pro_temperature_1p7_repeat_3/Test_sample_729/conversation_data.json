    "A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, has a well-defined structure from which we can determine the number of its cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q128 can be defined by the following presentation:\nQ128 = ⟨a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹⟩\n\nThe subgroups of Q128 can be divided into two categories: those that are subgroups of the cyclic group ⟨a⟩, and those that are not.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups within ⟨a⟩:** The element 'a' generates a cyclic subgroup of order 64. For any cyclic group, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of its order. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. This gives a total of 7 cyclic subgroups.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups not contained in ⟨a⟩:** The remaining 64 elements of Q128 are of the form aⁱx, where i ranges from 0 to 63. All of these elements have an order of 4. A cyclic subgroup of order 4 has two generators (the element and its inverse). Therefore, the 64 elements of order 4 generate 64 / 2 = 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nCombining these two sets of subgroups, the total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in Q128 is 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nThis result is also confirmed by a known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in a generalized quaternion group of order 2ⁿ, which is 2ⁿ⁻² + n. For Q128, n=7, so the number of cyclic subgroups is 2⁷⁻² + 7 = 2⁵ + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
