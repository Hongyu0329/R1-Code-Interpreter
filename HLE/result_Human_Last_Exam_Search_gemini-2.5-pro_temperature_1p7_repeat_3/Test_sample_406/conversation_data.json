    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point (x, y, z) that remains unchanged under three distinct mappings, F, G, and H, with specific domains and codomains. The conditions for the existence of such a point are found in the domain of fixed-point theory, particularly within the framework of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\n### Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nLet X, Y, and Z be non-empty sets. For the functions:\n*   F: X × Y × Z → X\n*   G: Y × X × Y → Y\n*   H: Z × Y × X → Z\n\nAn element (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is called an **FGH-tripled fixed point** if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThis concept was introduced as a generalization of the standard tripled fixed point and an extension of the FG-coupled fixed point.\n\n### Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are guaranteed under a specific set of conditions, which are primarily established in the context of partially ordered metric spaces. While the precise formulation of the theorems can vary, they generally require the following conditions to be met:\n\n1.  **Properties of the Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces endowed with partial orderings. A complete metric space is one in which every Cauchy sequence converges to an element within the space.\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property.\" This property relates the ordering of the inputs to the ordering of the outputs. For instance, F is considered to have the mixed monotone property if it is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. The specific mixed monotone properties for F, G, and H are defined in a way that works cohesively to ensure the iterative sequences used in the proof are convergent.\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a contractive-type condition. This condition ensures that the distances between the images of two points under F, G, and H are smaller than the distances between the original points, scaled by some factor. This is a generalization of the Banach contraction principle. For an FGH-tripled fixed point, the contractive inequality would involve all three functions and would look something like:\n    d(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) + d(G(y,x,y), G(v,u,v)) + d(H(z,y,x), H(w,v,u)) ≤ k * (d(x,u) + d(y,v) + d(z,w))\n    where (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) are comparable elements in the product space, and k is a constant less than 1. The exact form can vary and may involve more complex expressions.\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist an initial triplet (x₀, y₀, z₀) that has a specific relationship with its image under F, G, and H. For example, x₀ must be \"less than or equal to\" F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ must be \"greater than or equal to\" G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and so on, according to the partial order. This condition provides a starting point for the iterative construction of a sequence that converges to the fixed point.\n\n5.  **Continuity or Regularity:** Often, the theorem requires that the functions F, G, and H be continuous. However, this condition can sometimes be relaxed and replaced by a regularity condition on the space, which ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence converges to a point, then the term is less than or equal to the limit point.\n\nIf these general conditions are met, the existence of at least one FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed. To ensure that this fixed point is unique, an additional condition is typically required: for any two points in the product space, there must exist a third point that is comparable to both.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point exists for functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z if the spaces (X, dX), (Y, dY), and (Z, dZ) are complete, partially ordered metric spaces, the mappings F, G, and H satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition, and there exists an initial point satisfying a specific ordered relationship with its image under the mappings. For uniqueness, an additional condition on the comparability of elements in the product space is required."
