An FGH-tripled fixed point exists for functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z if the spaces (X, dX), (Y, dY), and (Z, dZ) are complete, partially ordered metric spaces, the mappings F, G, and H satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition, and there exists an initial point satisfying a specific ordered relationship with its image under the mappings. For uniqueness, an additional condition on the comparability of elements in the product space is required.
