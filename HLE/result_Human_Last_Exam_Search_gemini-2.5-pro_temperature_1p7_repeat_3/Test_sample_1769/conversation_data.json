    "Without the influence of the Old Norse language following the Viking invasions, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would almost certainly be **suster**.\n\nHere is the linguistic breakdown of how this conclusion is reached:\n\n*   **The Original Anglo-Saxon Word**: The native Old English word for a female sibling was **sweostor**, with common dialectal variations such as **swuster**. This word is a direct ancestor from Proto-Germanic *swestÄ“r, making it a cousin to other Germanic words like the German *Schwester* and Dutch *zuster*.\n\n*   **The Norse Influence**: The Vikings, who spoke Old Norse, used the word **systir** for the same relation. Old Norse and Old English were closely related languages, and during the period of intense interaction and settlement in the Danelaw, their vocabularies began to blend.\n\n*   **Linguistic \"Contamination\"**: In Middle English, the native word *sweostor* naturally evolved into forms like *suster*. However, the pronunciation was heavily influenced by the Old Norse *systir*. Specifically, the \"i\" vowel sound from *systir* replaced the \"u\" sound in *suster*. This process of one word's form blending with a related word from another language is a common linguistic phenomenon. The result was the hybrid word \"sister\" that we use today.\n\n*   **An Alternate Timeline**: In a history without Norse and Anglo-Saxon interaction, there would have been no *systir* to alter the native word's development. The Old English *sweostor* or *swuster* would have continued its natural evolution into the Middle English **suster**. From there, it would likely have been passed down into Modern English, retaining its form, much like the Dutch cognate *zuster*.\n\nTherefore, had the Norse never arrived, English speakers today would almost certainly refer to a female sibling as a \"suster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
