    "The ground space degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the number of independent, non-trivial logical operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but not necessarily with each other. The topology of the surface on which the code is defined dictates these operators.\n\n1.  **Toric Code on a Closed Surface:** For a closed surface of genus *g* (a sphere with *g* handles or \"donut holes\"), there are 2*g* independent non-trivial loops. This gives rise to 2*g* logical operators, which can be grouped into *g* pairs of anti-commuting logical X and Z operators. This encodes *g* logical qubits, leading to a ground state degeneracy of 2<sup>2g</sup>. A standard torus is a genus `g=1` surface, and its ground state degeneracy is 2<sup>2*1</sup> = 4.\n\n2.  **Holes as Boundaries:** The question refers to \"holes\" as boundaries on a surface, which are distinct from the genus of a surface. These are regions where the lattice is terminated. There are two primary types of boundaries for the toric code: smooth and rough.\n    *   **Smooth boundaries** are boundaries where plaquette operators are modified. Plaquette excitations (m-anyons or fluxes) can be absorbed or disappear at a smooth boundary. This allows for a logical Z operator (a string of Pauli-Z operators) to form a non-trivial loop around a smooth hole.\n    *   **Rough boundaries** are where star operators are modified. Star excitations (e-anyons or charges) can be absorbed at a rough boundary. This allows for a logical X operator (a string of Pauli-X operators) to form a non-trivial loop around a rough hole.\n\n3.  **Degeneracy from Holes:**\n    *   For each of the **n smooth holes**, one can define a logical qubit. The logical Z operator (`Z_i`) is a Wilson loop of Pauli-Z operators encircling the i-th hole. The corresponding logical X operator (`X_i`) is a string of Pauli-X operators running from the i-th smooth hole to another boundary. These `n` pairs of operators (`X_i`, `Z_i`) form `n` commuting logical qubits. Therefore, `n` smooth holes contribute a factor of 2<sup>n</sup> to the degeneracy. This is consistent with findings that `n` holes (of the same type, implicitly smooth) lead to a 2<sup>n</sup>-fold degeneracy.\n    *   Similarly, for each of the **m rough holes**, one can define a logical qubit by swapping the roles of X and Z operators. The logical X operator (`X_j`) is a 't Hooft loop of Pauli-X operators encircling the j-th rough hole. The corresponding logical Z operator (`Z_j`) is a string of Pauli-Z operators running from the j-th rough hole to another boundary. This set gives `m` logical qubits, contributing a factor of 2<sup>m</sup> to the degeneracy.\n\n4.  **Combining Smooth and Rough Holes:** The logical operators associated with the smooth holes (Z-loops and X-strings) commute with the logical operators associated with the rough holes (X-loops and Z-strings). Therefore, the total number of encoded logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each type of hole, which is `n + m`.\n\nThe total ground space degeneracy is the product of the degeneracies from each type of hole:\nDegeneracy = (Degeneracy from `n` smooth holes) × (Degeneracy from `m` rough holes) = 2<sup>n</sup> × 2<sup>m</sup> = 2<sup>n+m</sup>.\n\nThis corresponds to choice A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
