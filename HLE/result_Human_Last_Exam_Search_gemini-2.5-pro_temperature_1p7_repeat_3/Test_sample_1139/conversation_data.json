    "In the context of disordered systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model is a powerful theoretical framework. For systems belonging to symmetry class D, which are characterized by broken time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries, the target space of the sigma-model with *n* replicas is the symmetric superspace SpO(2n, ℝ|2n) / U(n|n).\n\nTo analyze transport properties beyond the average conductance, such as conductance variance, at least two replicas (n=2) are required. This means the relevant manifold is the superspace G/K = SpO(4, ℝ|4) / U(2|2).\n\nThe variables used to describe this space are divided into standard commuting numbers (bosonic or non-Grassmann variables) and anti-commuting Grassmann numbers (fermionic variables). The question asks for the number of non-Grassmann variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of this space. This number is equal to the dimension of the bosonic part of the manifold.\n\nThe bosonic part of the supergroup G = SpO(4, ℝ|4) is the Lie group Sp(4, ℝ) × O(4). The dimension of this group is the sum of the dimensions of its components:\n*   The dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2n, ℝ) is n(2n+1). For n=2, dim(Sp(4, ℝ)) = 2(2*2 + 1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the orthogonal group O(n) is n(n-1)/2. For n=4, dim(O(4)) = 4(4-1)/2 = 6.\n*   Thus, the total dimension of the bosonic part of G is 10 + 6 = 16.\n\nThe bosonic part of the subgroup K = U(2|2) is the Lie group U(2) × U(2). The dimension of this subgroup is:\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². For n=2, dim(U(2)) = 2² = 4.\n*   Thus, the total dimension of the bosonic part of K is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector is the dimension of the bosonic coset space, which is the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic parts of G and K:\n\nNumber of variables = dim(Bosonic G) - dim(Bosonic K) = 16 - 8 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
