    "The provided protein sequences are de novo designed coiled-coil peptides. Their oligomeric states—whether they form dimers, trimers, or other multimers—are determined by specific amino acid patterns within their sequences. These states have been experimentally determined and published in scientific literature. The correct oligomeric states for the given sequences are as follows:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is designed as a **dimer** (2). Its structure has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography and is deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence also forms a **dimer** (2). It is a well-characterized de novo designed coiled-coil.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This peptide is designed to form a **tetramer** (4). The arrangement of isoleucine residues at key positions within the heptad repeat promotes the formation of a four-helix bundle.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** This sequence is designed to be a **dimer** (2). Similar to the first two sequences, the placement of its hydrophobic and charged residues favors a dimeric state.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This sequence forms a **trimer** (3). The specific positioning of threonine and other residues in the core of the coiled-coil directs it to assemble into a three-stranded structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of oligomeric states for the given peptides is 2, 2, 4, 2, 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
