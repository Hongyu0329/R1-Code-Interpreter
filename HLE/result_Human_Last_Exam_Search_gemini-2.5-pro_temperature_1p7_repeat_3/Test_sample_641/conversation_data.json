    "I have been unable to find a direct formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997). The scientific literature consulted provides general formulas for the number of involutions in the larger general unitary group U(n,q) or discusses the number of conjugacy classes of involutions, but the specifics for PSU(4,q) where q â‰¡ 5 (mod 8), which is the case for q=997, are not explicitly detailed in the search results. The calculation requires either deeper results from the theory of finite groups, specifically on the structure and conjugacy classes of PSU(4,q) for this specific congruence, or the use of specialized computer algebra systems to compute the character table or class information, which are beyond my capabilities.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a numerical answer to the question.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer to the question as the exact formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is not available in the searched documents, and its derivation requires more advanced mathematical tools than are currently accessible to me.>>>"
