    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights, we must first define the graph's structure and the sampling process.\n\n### Barbell Graph Structure\n\nA barbell graph is typically constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a path. For a graph with 10 nodes, a common and simple structure is to have two complete graphs of the same size, with a single edge connecting them. In this case, the 10 nodes are divided into two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5). These two K5 graphs are then joined by a single edge.\n\n### The Bottleneck Edge\n\nThe \"bottleneck edge\" is the edge that connects the two large, dense communities (the cliques). Its removal would disconnect the two cliques. In the defined structure of two K5 graphs connected by a path, the bottleneck is the single edge that joins them. There is only one such edge in this configuration.\n\n### Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping implies that each edge in the graph has an equal probability of being selected at any given time. Therefore, the probability of sampling any specific edge is 1 divided by the total number of edges in the graph.\n\n### Calculating the Total Number of Edges\n\nTo find the probability, we need to calculate the total number of edges in the 10-node barbell graph. The graph consists of three parts:\n1.  **The first complete graph (K5):** The number of edges in a complete graph with *n* nodes is given by the formula n * (n-1) / 2.\n    *   For a K5, the number of edges is 5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10 edges.\n2.  **The second complete graph (K5):** This graph is identical to the first.\n    *   It also has 10 edges.\n3.  **The connecting bottleneck edge:** As defined, there is 1 edge connecting the two K5 cliques.\n\nThe total number of edges in the barbell graph is the sum of the edges from all three parts:\nTotal Edges = (Edges in first K5) + (Edges in second K5) + (Bottleneck edge)\nTotal Edges = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21 edges.\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the ratio of the number of bottleneck edges to the total number of edges in the graph.\n\n*   Number of bottleneck edges = 1\n*   Total number of edges = 21\n\nProbability = 1 / 21\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph constructed from two K5 cliques is 1/21.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
