    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must analyze its structure based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which is dictated by the arrangement of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids in a repeating seven-residue pattern known as a heptad repeat (`abcdefg`).\n\n### Heptad Repeat Analysis\n\nIn a canonical coiled-coil, the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat are typically hydrophobic. They form the core of the structure, providing the thermodynamic driving force for oligomerization. The specific identity of the amino acids at these core 'a' and 'd' positions is a primary determinant of the final oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n\nThe key rules derived from experimental studies are as follows:\n*   **Dimers** are favored when isoleucine (I) is at the 'a' position and leucine (L) is at the 'd' position.\n*   **Tetramers** are favored in the reverse arrangement, with leucine (L) at the 'a' position and isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position.\n*   **Trimers** are often formed when there is a more even distribution of isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\n### Applying the Rules to the Sequence\n\nLet's assign the heptad positions to the given sequence:\n**`GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`**\n\nTo find the correct register, we look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues that fit the `(a) b c (d) e f g` structure. Let's test a register that aligns the prominent hydrophobic residues (I and L) into the core 'a' and 'd' positions. A highly plausible alignment starts with the first isoleucine at a 'd' position.\n\nLet's map the sequence starting from the third residue (I) as position 'd':\n\n**`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`**\n      `d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c` (G is a C-terminal cap)\n\nThis assignment results in the following residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions over four heptad repeats:\n\n*   **Heptad 1:** `a` = L (position 7), `d` = I (position 3)\n*   **Heptad 2:** `a` = L (position 14), `d` = I (position 10)\n*   **Heptad 3:** `a` = L (position 21), `d` = I (position 17)\n*   **Heptad 4:** `a` = L (position 28), `d` = I (position 24)\n\n### Conclusion on Oligomeric State\n\nThe analysis reveals a consistent pattern: **Leucine (L) residues occupy all 'a' positions, and Isoleucine (I) residues occupy all 'd' positions.**\n\nThis \"L at 'a' and I at 'd'\" arrangement is the classic signature for the formation of a **tetrameric** (four-helix) coiled-coil. The packing of the bulkier, Î²-branched isoleucine at the `d` position and the more flexible leucine at the `a` position is sterically and energetically favorable for a four-helix bundle structure. The other residues in the sequence, such as the charged (K, E) and polar (Q, S) amino acids at the solvent-exposed `b, c, e, f, g` positions, are consistent with stabilizing an alpha-helical structure in an aqueous environment.\n\nTherefore, the protein coiled-coil sequence is predicted to form a tetramer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
