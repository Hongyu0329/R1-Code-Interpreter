    "The semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$, is a non-abelian group of order $2^9$. Its structure is defined by the presentation $\\langle r, s | r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$. A subgroup of a group G is called a power subgroup if it can be expressed as the set of k-th powers of all elements in G for some integer k.\n\nTo find the number of power subgroups, we analyze the sets $G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$ for different values of k.\n\nFirst, consider the case where **k is an odd integer**. For any odd k, the set of k-th powers of all elements of $SD_{512}$ is the group $SD_{512}$ itself. Therefore, all odd values of k yield only one distinct power subgroup, which is the group G itself.\n\nNext, consider the case where **k is an even integer**. For any even k, the set of k-th powers of all elements in $SD_{512}$ forms a cyclic subgroup generated by an element of the form $r^d$, where $d$ is a divisor of 256. Specifically, the resulting subgroup is $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$. Since k is even, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of k and 256 must also be an even number.\n\nThe divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. The even divisors among these are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. Each of these eight even divisors corresponds to a distinct cyclic subgroup:\n*   $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThese eight subgroups are all the possible power subgroups for even values of k.\n\nCombining the results from both cases, we have one power subgroup from the odd values of k (the group $SD_{512}$ itself) and eight distinct power subgroups from the even values of k.\n\nIn total, the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is $1 + 8 = 9$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
