    "The determinant of the provided adjacency matrix is 0.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nTo compute the determinant of this matrix, one can use the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2*2 - (-1)*(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)*2 - (-1)*(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*(-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6 = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can observe that the sum of the entries in each row is 0 (2 - 1 - 1 = 0). A matrix with a row or column of zeros has a determinant of 0. When the sum of the rows is a zero vector, it indicates that the rows are linearly dependent, which implies that the matrix is singular and its determinant is zero.\n\nThe context provided, \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\),\" points to the realm of cluster algebras and representation theory. The \"Markov quiver\" is a cyclic quiver with three vertices, and the matrix provided is its associated affine Cartan matrix of type \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\). The number 13 is a Markov number, and its presence confirms this context. In the classification of generalized Cartan matrices, those of affine type have a determinant of 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
