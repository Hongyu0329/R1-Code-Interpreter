    "The most frequently cited method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gases. This direct combination is considered an efficient method for production.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the synthesis is typically carried out under the following conditions:\n*   A molar ratio of 1 part xenon to 5 parts fluorine (1:5).\n*   The mixture is heated in a nickel container.\n*   The standard temperature for this reaction is 400 °C. A patent for the process specifies a temperature range of 350 to 450 °C, with 400 °C being the preferred temperature.\n*   The reaction is performed at elevated pressures, for instance, around 6-7 bar.\n\nWhile other synthesis methods exist, such as using an electric discharge or UV radiation, the thermal method at 400 °C is consistently presented as the standard for efficient production. For instance, the original synthesis in 1962 was achieved by heating the elements to 400 °C. Flow methods also utilize a temperature range of 300-500°C. Temperatures much lower than this are noted to favor the production of xenon difluoride (XeF2) instead.\n\nBased on this information, 400 °C is the coldest temperature from the given options at which XeF4 can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
