For a simulation of a universal gate implementation on a distance-3 surface code, the approximate number of non-Clifford T gates required is 4 to 7. For the implementation of a universal quantum computer on a distance-5 surface code capable of running a small algorithm like factoring 21, the number is on the order of a few dozen non-Clifford gates. For a large-scale algorithm like factoring a 2048-bit number, the number would be on the order of 10ยนโฐ T gates.
