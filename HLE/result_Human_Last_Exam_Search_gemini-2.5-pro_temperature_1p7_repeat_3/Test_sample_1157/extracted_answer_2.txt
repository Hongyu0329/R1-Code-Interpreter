The appropriate management involves a multi-stage approach, starting with delayed replantation of the avulsed teeth to preserve alveolar bone, while being fully aware that ankylosis and resorption are inevitable. This requires immediate medical consultation to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c of 7.5%) to aid healing and prevent infection, alongside antibiotic therapy. The SNB angle of 88Â° indicates a prognathic mandible (skeletal Class III), which must be factored into the design of the final prosthesis. The cells of interest are primarily osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which will mediate the resorption and ankylosis process due to the non-viability of the periodontal ligament cells after the 28-hour delay. For definitive tooth replacement, a cast metal framework removable partial denture, likely made of a biocompatible titanium alloy with acrylic teeth, is recommended. The abutment teeth for this denture would include the left central incisor and second premolar as primary supports, with the right first and second premolars engaged for crucial cross-arch stabilization.
