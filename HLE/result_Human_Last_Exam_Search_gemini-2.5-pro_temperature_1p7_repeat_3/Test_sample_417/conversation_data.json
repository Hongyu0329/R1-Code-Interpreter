    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry is required.\n\nThe molecule can be broken down into three main components for analysis:\n1.  **The central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core.**\n2.  **The three methylene (-CH2-) linker groups.**\n3.  **The three identical (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl substituents.**\n\n**Analysis of Molecular Symmetry:**\n\nThe central benzene ring is substituted at positions 1, 3, and 5 with identical large, chiral groups. This creates a C3 rotational axis of symmetry through the center of the ring. Due to this symmetry, the three substituents are chemically equivalent, as are the three methyl groups on the benzene ring and the three methylene linker groups. Therefore, we only need to determine the number of unique proton signals in one of the repeating units and add the signals from the central core.\n\n**Signal Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Central Mesitylene Core:**\n    *   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will integrate to 9 protons and appear as a single peak. (**1 peak**)\n    *   The aromatic protons at positions 1, 3, and 5 have been replaced by the substituents, so there are no aromatic C-H signals from the central ring.\n\n*   **Methylene (-CH2-) Linkers:**\n    *   The three -CH2- groups are equivalent by C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, each -CH2- group is attached to a stereocenter within the large substituent. This makes the two protons of the methylene group diastereotopic, and therefore, they are not chemically equivalent.\n    *   These two non-equivalent protons will likely appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet) due to geminal coupling. Thus, the three equivalent methylene units will give rise to two distinct signals. (**2 peaks**)\n\n*   **(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl Substituent:**\n    *   This portion of the molecule is derived from camphor, a bicyclic compound, and is referred to as (4S,7R)-campho[2,3-c]pyrazole. It has two stereogenic centers.\n    *   Because there are no internal planes of symmetry within this substituent, and due to its rigid, bicyclic nature, all the protons are in unique chemical environments and are non-equivalent.\n    *   Let's count the protons in one of these units:\n        *   **Three Methyl Groups:** The methyl groups at C7, and the two at C8 (gem-dimethyl) are all diastereotopic. The two methyls at C8 are non-equivalent because of the chiral environment of the rest of the bicyclic system. This results in **3 peaks**.\n        *   **Ring Protons:** We need to count the remaining C-H protons. The structure is a tetrahydro-4,7-methano-indazole. Let's trace the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-derived skeleton:\n            *   One proton at the C4 bridgehead. (**1 peak**)\n            *   One proton on the indazole ring at C3. (**1 peak**)\n            *   Two diastereotopic protons at C5 (a CH2 group). (**2 peaks**)\n            *   Two diastereotopic protons at C6 (a CH2 group). (**2 peaks**)\n    *   In total, within one substituent, there are 3 (from CH3) + 1 (from C4-H) + 1 (from C3-H) + 2 (from C5-H2) + 2 (from C6-H2) = **9 peaks**.\n\n**Total Number of Peaks:**\n\nBy summing the peaks from each distinct part of the molecule, we get:\n*   From the central methyl groups: 1\n*   From the linking methylene groups: 2\n*   From the camphor-indazole substituent: 9\n\nTotal peaks = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectra.\n\n<<<L>>>"
