    "After a thorough investigation into the history of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, no evidence could be found of a unique architectural feature being removed by the city administration in 1950.\n\nHistorical records and numerous sources detail various transformations of the square and the adjacent Pantheon over the centuries. These include the initial clearing of medieval structures to create the piazza, the addition of the central fountain in the 16th century, and the later placement of the Egyptian obelisk on the fountain in the 18th century. There have also been several demolitions of surrounding buildings at different times to enlarge the square.\n\nA significant architectural removal associated with the Pantheon itself was the demolition of the twin bell towers, often pejoratively called the \"ass's ears,\" in the late 19th century. These had been added to the ancient structure and were not an original feature.\n\nHowever, extensive searches for any architectural element removed specifically from the Piazza della Rotonda in or around the year 1950 have not yielded any results. It is possible the information about a 1950 removal is inaccurate or refers to a minor, unrecorded change.\n\n<<<Based on the available information, there is no record of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.>>>"
