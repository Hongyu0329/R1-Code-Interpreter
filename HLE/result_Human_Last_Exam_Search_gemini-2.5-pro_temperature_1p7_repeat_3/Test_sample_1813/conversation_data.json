    "Based on the research paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers\" by Esther Banaian and Archan Sen, the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is associated with a specific continued fraction, denoted as \\( C_{p/q} \\). These numbers are solutions to the Diophantine equation \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz \\).\n\nThe authors provide a table of these continued fractions for rational numbers \\( p/q \\) where \\( p \\le q/2 \\). For cases where \\( p > q/2 \\), the associated Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is the same as \\( m_{(q-p)/q} \\). This implies that the numerator of the continued fraction for \\( p/q \\) is the same as for \\( (q-p)/q \\). This property arises from the fact that the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{(q-p)/q} \\) is the reverse of the one associated with \\( m_{p/q} \\), and a continued fraction and its reverse have the same numerator.\n\nTo find the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\), we can use this symmetry property. Here, \\( p=4 \\) and \\( q=7 \\). Since \\( 4 > 7/2 \\), we look at the case for \\( (7-4)/7 = 3/7 \\). The continued fraction \\( C_{4/7} \\) will be the reverse of \\( C_{3/7} \\).\n\nFrom the tables provided in the paper by Banaian and Sen, the continued fraction for \\( m_{3/7} \\) is:\n\\( C_{3/7} = \\)\n\nThis continued fraction is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards. Therefore, reversing it yields the same sequence.\n\nThus, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the same as for \\( m_{3/7} \\).\n\n<<<>>>"
