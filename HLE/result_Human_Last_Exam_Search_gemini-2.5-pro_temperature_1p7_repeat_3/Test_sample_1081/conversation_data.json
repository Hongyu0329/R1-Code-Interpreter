    "I have performed an initial search and have gathered some information about reductive groups, maximal tori, and Weyl groups. Here's a summary of what I've found and what I still need to do:\n\n**What I have:**\n*   A general understanding of reductive groups over finite fields and the definition of an F_q-rational maximal torus.\n*   The key principle that the F_q-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the F-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W.\n*   The order of the Weyl group of E_8, which is W(E_8) = 696,729,600.\n*   Some information about the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of E_8.\n\n**What I still need:**\n*   A clear and definitive statement about the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of E_8. The initial search results provide some details about specific conjugacy classes but not the total number.\n*   A confirmation of the relationship between the number of rational maximal tori and the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group, especially for the split case over a finite field. For a split reductive group over a finite field, the Frobenius action F on the Weyl group is trivial. In this case, the F-conjugacy classes are just the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group.\n*   To synthesize the information to arrive at the final number.\n\nBased on this, my next step should be to find a precise count of the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of E_8. After that, I will be able to answer the user's question.I have gathered sufficient information to answer the question. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n*   A reductive group of type E_8 over a finite field F_q can be considered in the \"split\" case. This means that the Frobenius endomorphism F acts trivially on the Weyl group W.\n*   The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G over F_q is in one-to-one correspondence with the number of F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W.\n*   An F-conjugacy class of an element `w` in W is the set of all elements of the form `v * w * F(v)^-1`, where `v` is in W.\n*   Since the group is split, the Frobenius action F is trivial on W. Therefore, the F-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W.\n*   The Weyl group for a group of type E_8 is denoted as W(E_8).\n*   Multiple sources confirm that the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E_8) is 112.\n\nTherefore, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8 over F_q is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of E_8.\n\nI am now ready to provide the final answer.\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\nFor a split reductive group over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, such as the case of a group of type $E_8$ where the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the associated root system, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group, $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$, is a finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed to be 112. Therefore, there are 112 distinct $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori up to conjugacy.\n\n<<<112>>>"
