    "I am unable to determine the exact number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nExtensive searches confirmed that Svetlana Gileva did perform this role with the Semperoper Ballett during the specified period. Reviews from performances around that time, including a 2018 London tour, praise her interpretation of the choreography.\n\nHowever, video recordings of the 2015 performance featuring Svetlana Gileva in the \"Jete Woman\" solo, which were previously available on platforms like YouTube, are no longer accessible. Without a visual record of the performance, it is impossible to identify and count the specific ballet steps in question.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized step in ballet terminology. It is likely an informal descriptor for a sequence of movements within the choreography that evokes the characteristic style of George Balanchine, known for its speed, articulation, and dynamic quality. There are social media trends among dancers using the hashtag #pasdebalanchine to showcase such movements. However, without a precise definition within the context of Forsythe's work or a viewable performance, a definitive count remains unattainable.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer.>>>"
