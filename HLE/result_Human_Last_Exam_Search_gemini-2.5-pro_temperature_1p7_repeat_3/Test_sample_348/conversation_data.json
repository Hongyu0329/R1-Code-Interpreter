    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal. The total welfare is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus at this equilibrium point.\n\n**1. Finding Market Equilibrium**\n\nThe market equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied (Q_S) equals the quantity demanded (Q_D) and the price (P) is the same for both. Let Q be the equilibrium quantity.\n\n*   Supply: P = ln(Q³ - 2)\n*   Demand: P = 18e^(-arctan(Q))\n\nWe set the two equations equal to find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E):\nln(Q³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q))\n\nThis equation cannot be solved algebraically. Using numerical methods to solve for Q, we find the equilibrium quantity:\n*   **Q_E ≈ 2.769**\n\nNow, we substitute Q_E back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price (P_E). Using the supply function:\nP_E = ln((2.769)³ - 2)\nP_E = ln(21.23 - 2)\nP_E = ln(19.23)\n*   **P_E ≈ 3.016**\n\n**2. Calculating Consumer Surplus (CS)**\n\nConsumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from Q=0 to Q=Q_E. It is calculated by the integral:\nCS = ∫ [from 0 to Q_E] (P_D(Q) - P_E) dQ\nCS = ∫ [from 0 to 2.769] (18e^(-arctan(Q)) - 3.016) dQ\n\nThis integral is also evaluated using numerical methods:\n*   **CS ≈ 16.295**\n\n**3. Calculating Producer Surplus (PS)**\n\nProducer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The supply function P = ln(Q³ - 2) is defined for Q³ - 2 > 0, which means Q > ³√2 ≈ 1.26. Therefore, the integration is from Q = 1.26 to Q_E.\nPS = ∫ [from ³√2 to Q_E] (P_E - P_S(Q)) dQ\nPS = ∫ [from 1.26 to 2.769] (3.016 - ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nEvaluating this integral numerically:\n*   **PS ≈ 2.193**\n\n**4. Calculating Total Welfare (TW)**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\nTW = CS + PS\nTW = 16.295 + 2.193\nTW ≈ 18.488\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total welfare is 18.49.\n\n<<<18.49>>>"
