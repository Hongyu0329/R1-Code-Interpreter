    "Let the given sequence be denoted by a(n), where n starts from 1.\nThe terms are:\na(1) = 2\na(2) = 11\na(3) = 23\na(4) = 51\na(5) = 119\n\nWe need to find the next term, a(6).\n\nLet's try to find a pattern or a rule that connects the terms. We can examine the relationship between a term and its preceding terms.\n\nLet's test for a linear recurrence relation of the form `a(n) = A * a(n-1) + B * a(n-2) + C`.\n\nLet's test the option `a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) + a(n-2) + C`.\nFor n = 3: `23 = 2 * 11 + 2 + C => 23 = 24 + C => C = -1`\nFor n = 4: `51 = 2 * 23 + 11 + C => 51 = 46 + 11 + C => 51 = 57 + C => C = -6`\nFor n = 5: `119 = 2 * 51 + 23 + C => 119 = 102 + 23 + C => 119 = 125 + C => C = -6`\n\nWe can observe that for n â‰¥ 4, the rule `a(n) = 2 * a(n-1) + a(n-2) - 6` holds true.\n\nLet's verify this rule for the given terms:\n*   For n = 4: `a(4) = 2 * a(3) + a(2) - 6 = 2 * 23 + 11 - 6 = 46 + 11 - 6 = 51`. This matches the actual value of a(4).\n*   For n = 5: `a(5) = 2 * a(4) + a(3) - 6 = 2 * 51 + 23 - 6 = 102 + 23 - 6 = 119`. This matches the actual value of a(5).\n\nSince the rule is consistent for the later terms in the sequence, we can use it to find the next term, a(6).\n\n*   For n = 6: `a(6) = 2 * a(5) + a(4) - 6 = 2 * 119 + 51 - 6 = 238 + 51 - 6 = 289 - 6 = 285`.\n\nThus, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 285. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
