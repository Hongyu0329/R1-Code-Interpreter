The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value and depends on the specific reaction and conditions. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, a Ni loading of 5-12.5 wt% is generally effective, with some studies highlighting an optimum around 7% molar. For water splitting, the synergistic effects of co-doping with other metals like iron, or using nickel compounds such as nitrides, appear more critical than a specific Ni/Ce ratio.
