    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy system, the rule activation level is determined by performing a t-norm operation between the firing strength of the rule's antecedent, denoted as `Φk(x′)`, and the membership grade of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy logic.\n\nIn this context, both `Φk(x′)` and `μG_k_j(y_j)` are typically intervals to represent higher degrees of uncertainty. However, the query provides specific scalar values: `Φk(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This implies a simplified case, for example, considering the upper bounds of these intervals at a specific alpha-cut. The rule activation level is therefore calculated by applying a t-norm to these two values.\n\nThe most common t-norms used in fuzzy logic are the **minimum t-norm** and the **product t-norm**.\n\n1.  **Minimum t-norm**: This t-norm simply takes the minimum of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = min(Φk(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Product t-norm**: This t-norm calculates the algebraic product of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = Φk(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nSince the problem does not specify which t-norm to use, the answer depends on the chosen operation. If the commonly used minimum t-norm is applied, the activation level is 0.7. If the product t-norm is used, the result is 0.63. Given the prevalence of the minimum t-norm in many fuzzy system implementations, it is a very common choice.\n\n<<<The rule activation level is **0.7** using the minimum t-norm or **0.63** using the product t-norm.>>>"
