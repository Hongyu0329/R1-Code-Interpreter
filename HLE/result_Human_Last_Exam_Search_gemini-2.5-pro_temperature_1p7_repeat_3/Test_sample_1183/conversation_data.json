    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a fragment of γ-graphyne (gamma-graphyne). Graphynes are carbon allotropes characterized by a planar structure containing both sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in aromatic rings and sp-hybridized carbon atoms in acetylenic linkages.\n\nThe specific structure derived from the provided SMILES string reveals a highly symmetric, planar molecule. The analysis of its structure indicates the presence of the following symmetry elements:\n*   A six-fold principal axis of rotation (C₆) perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n*   Six two-fold axes of rotation (C₂) in the molecular plane.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) coincident with the molecular plane.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) that pass through opposite vertices.\n*   Three dihedral mirror planes (σₔ) that bisect the angles between the C₂ axes.\n*   An inversion center (i).\n\nThe combination of these symmetry elements unequivocally assigns the molecule to the D₆ₕ point group. This is the same point group as graphene, which also possesses a hexagonal lattice. Studies on graphyne and its derivatives have confirmed that they exhibit this high level of symmetry.\n\n<<<D₆ₕ>>>"
