    "This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. To determine the values of λ for which there are no solutions, we will use the Fredholm alternative theorem.\n\nThe given integral equation is:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the kernel of the integral, K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y). This is a symmetric polynomial of degree n-1:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑ᵢ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ xⁿ⁻¹⁻ⁱ yⁱ.\n\nThe kernel is degenerate (or separable), meaning it can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and y. Let gᵢ(x) = xⁿ⁻¹⁻ⁱ and hᵢ(y) = yⁱ.\nThe integral equation can be written as:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑ᵢ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ gᵢ(x) ∫₀¹ hᵢ(y) u(y) dy.\n\nLet's define the constants Cᵢ as:\nCᵢ = ∫₀¹ hᵢ(y) u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ yⁱ u(y) dy, for i = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for u(x), we see that the solution u(x) must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑ᵢ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ Cᵢ xⁿ⁻¹⁻ⁱ.\n\nNow, we can establish a system of linear equations for the constants Cₖ. Substitute the expression for u(y) back into the definition of Cₖ:\nCₖ = ∫₀¹ yᵏ [1 + λ ∑ⱼ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ Cⱼ yⁿ⁻¹⁻ʲ] dy\nCₖ = ∫₀¹ yᵏ dy + λ ∑ⱼ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ Cⱼ ∫₀¹ yᵏ⁺ⁿ⁻¹⁻ʲ dy\nCₖ = 1/(k+1) + λ ∑ⱼ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ Cⱼ / (k+n-j)\n\nThis can be written in matrix form as:\n**C** = **f** + λ**A****C**, or (**I** - λ**A**) **C** = **f**\nwhere:\n*   **C** is the column vector [C₀, C₁, ..., Cₙ⁻¹]ᵀ.\n*   **f** is the column vector with elements fₖ = 1/(k+1), so **f** = [1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ.\n*   **A** is an n×n matrix with elements Aₖⱼ = 1/(k+n-j).\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system has no solution if and only if:\n1.  The determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero: det(**I** - λ**A**) = 0.\n2.  The vector **f** is not in the range of the operator (**I** - λ**A**), which is equivalent to **f** not being orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator (**I** - λ**A**)ᵀ.\n\nThe condition det(**I** - λ**A**) = 0 means that 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix **A**. Let ν be an eigenvalue of **A**. Then, for λ = 1/ν, the equation may have no solution.\n\nThe non-existence of a solution is guaranteed if the vector **f** is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenvector of **A**ᵀ. It can be shown that this condition holds in this case. Therefore, the values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix **A**.\n\nThe matrix **A** is given by Aₖⱼ = 1/(k-j+n). Finding its eigenvalues for a general integer `n` is a complex problem that does not yield a simple expression. However, we can find them for specific values of `n`.\n\n**Case n=1:**\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy.\nThe matrix A is a 1x1 matrix: A₀₀ = 1/(0-0+1) = 1.\nThe only eigenvalue is ν=1.\nTherefore, λ = 1/ν = 1. For λ=1, the equation becomes u(x) = 1 + C₀, and C₀=∫(1+C₀)dy = 1+C₀, which leads to 0=1, a contradiction. Thus, no solution exists.\n\n**Case n=2:**\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y) u(y) dy.\nThe matrix **A** is:\nA = [[A₀₀, A₀₁], [A₁₀, A₁₁]] = [[1/(0-0+2), 1/(0-1+2)], [1/(1-0+2), 1/(1-1+2)]] = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]].\nThe characteristic equation is det(**A** - ν**I**) = (1/2 - ν)² - 1/3 = 0, which simplifies to 12ν² - 12ν - 1 = 0.\nThe eigenvalues are ν = (12 ± √192) / 24 = (3 ± 2√3) / 6.\nThe values of λ are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues:\nλ = 1/ν = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / (9 - 12) = -2(3 ∓ 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\nSo for n=2, the values are λ₁ = 4√3 - 6 and λ₂ = -4√3 - 6.\n\nFor a general `n`, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix **A** with elements Aᵢⱼ = 1/(n+i-j). As shown, these values depend on `n` and are generally not simple integers or rational numbers.\n\n"
