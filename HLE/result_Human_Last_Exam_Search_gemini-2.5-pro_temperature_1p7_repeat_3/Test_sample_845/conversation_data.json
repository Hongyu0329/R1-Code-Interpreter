    "The value between heartbeats used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is most commonly called the **interbeat interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhen measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), this value is often specifically referred to as the **RR interval**. This name comes from the \"R\" peak in the QRS complex of an ECG waveform, and the interval is the time between successive R peaks.\n\nAnother term you might encounter is the **NN interval**, which stands for \"normal-to-normal\" interval. This term is used to specify that the intervals are between consecutive heartbeats originating from the sinus node, after any irregular beats or artifacts have been removed from the data.\n\nWhile PPG (photoplethysmography) does not measure the R-peaks of an ECG, the time between the pulses it detects is still fundamentally a measure of the beat-to-beat interval. Therefore, IBI is a very accurate term, although RR interval is also frequently used in the context of HRV analysis regardless of the recording method.\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI)>>>"
