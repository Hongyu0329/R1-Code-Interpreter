    "The exact value for the angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability for the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by $\\alpha = \\arctan(2\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}})$.\n\nThe determination of the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle for BDF methods involves finding the largest sector of the complex plane, symmetric about the negative real axis, that is contained within the method's stability region. This sector is denoted by $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is found by identifying the point on the stability boundary where a tangent line passes through the origin.\n\nRecent work by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis has provided exact analytical expressions for these angles for BDF methods of orders 3 through 6. While older and some recent literature mentions an approximate value of $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$ for BDF4, the exact expression for the tangent of the angle is more complex than a simple rational or elementary radical.\n\nThe exact value derived by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis can be expressed as:\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha) = 4(2+\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nFrom this, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in terms of the arctan function is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(2\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$\n\n<<<$\\arctan(2\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}})$>>>"
