    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a multi-step calculation process is required, as standard calculators cannot handle a number of this magnitude directly. The solution relies on the periodic nature of the tangent function.\n\nThe tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x - kπ) for any integer k. Therefore, tan(10^100) is equivalent to tan(10^100 mod π). This reduces the problem to finding the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π.\n\nThis can be expressed as tan(π * {10^100 / π}), where {y} denotes the fractional part of y. To find the fractional part of 10^100 / π, we can use the decimal expansion of 1/π. Shifting the decimal point 100 places to the right in the decimal representation of 1/π gives us the value of 10^100 / π. The fractional part of this new number is what we need for our calculation.\n\nThe value of 1/π to a high degree of precision is required. The decimal expansion of 1/π begins as 0.3183098861... To find the fractional part of 10^100 / π, we look at the digits of 1/π starting from the 101st decimal place.\n\nHigh-precision calculations show that the digits of 1/π from the 101st place onwards are `129538...`. Thus, the fractional part of 10^100 / π is approximately 0.129538.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the tangent of this value multiplied by π.\nValue to calculate = tan(0.129538 * π).\n\nThis calculation gives:\ntan(0.129538 * 3.14159265...) = tan(0.406954...) ≈ 0.43100.\n\nThe first three digits after the decimal point are 431. This method, which involves finding the modular value with respect to π, is the standard way to solve for trigonometric functions of very large numbers and is a classic problem in numerical analysis.\n\n<<<431>>>"
