    "## Unraveling Filled Groups: A Look at Nonabelian Groups of a Specific Order\n\nIn the realm of abstract algebra, a finite group G is classified as \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also \"fills\" the group. While the concept might seem abstract, it leads to interesting classifications of groups with specific properties. This exploration delves into identifying the nonabelian filled groups that have an order of 2q^m, where 'q' is an odd prime number and 'm' is a natural number.\n\n### Defining the Concepts\n\nFirst, let's break down the terminology. A subset 'S' of a group 'G' is considered **product-free** if the product of any two elements in S (including an element with itself) does not result in an element within S. A product-free set is **maximal by inclusion** if it cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without violating the product-free property.\n\nA product-free set 'S' is said to **fill** or be **complete** in a group G if every non-identity element of the group can be found either within the set S itself or as a product of two elements from S. A group G is then defined as a **filled group** if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within it is also a complete set.\n\nIt's noteworthy that all elementary abelian 2-groups (groups where every element is its own inverse and the operation is commutative) are filled groups. Among abelian groups, the only other filled groups are the cyclic groups of order 3 and 5.\n\n### Investigating Nonabelian Groups of Order 2q^m\n\nThe groups in question have an order of 2q^m. A key result in group theory states that any group of this order must contain a normal subgroup of order q^m. This structural property is a crucial starting point.\n\nFor a nonabelian group G of order 2q^m to be filled, a significant result from the study of filled groups comes into play. It has been shown that if a filled group G has a normal subgroup N, then the quotient group G/N must also be filled. In our case, the normal subgroup of order q^m has an index of 2. Therefore, the quotient group G/N is of order 2, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2 (C2). Since C2 is an elementary abelian 2-group, it is indeed a filled group. This confirms that the condition on the quotient group is met.\n\nFurther research into the classification of filled groups has provided a more direct answer. A study by R. Street and D. Whitehead, who introduced the concept of filled groups, along with subsequent work by other mathematicians, has established a classification for filled groups of certain orders. For nonabelian groups, the focus often turns to their structure and specific families.\n\nThe investigation into nonabelian filled groups has revealed that the only such groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the **dihedral groups of order 2q**, where q is an odd prime (i.e., m=1).\n\nThe dihedral group of order 2n, denoted D_n or D_2n, can be visualized as the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon. Nonabelian groups of order 2q, where q is an odd prime, are known to be isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 2q.\n\nWhile the general theory of filled groups can be quite complex, the specific constraints on the order of the group in this question allow for a precise answer based on existing classifications.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups of order 2q, which corresponds to the case where m=1.>>>A definitive answer to the question of which nonabelian groups of order 2q^m are \"filled\" requires a deep dive into the specialized area of group theory that deals with product-free sets. A finite group is termed \"filled\" if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets are also \"complete,\" meaning every non-identity element of the group is either in the set or is a product of two elements from the set.\n\nFor nonabelian groups with an order of 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, the classification of such \"filled\" groups has been a subject of specific research. A crucial piece of information is that any nonabelian group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 2p, denoted D_p or D_2p.\n\nThe dihedral group D_n represents the symmetries of a regular n-gon and is non-abelian for n â‰¥ 3. The structure of these groups, particularly their subgroups and element orders, plays a key role in determining if they are filled.\n\nResearch into the classification of filled groups has shown that the property is quite restrictive. While the complete classification of all finite simple groups is a monumental achievement in mathematics, the classification of filled groups is a more specialized endeavor.\n\nFor the specific order 2q^m, the existing literature on filled groups points to a precise answer. It has been established that the only nonabelian filled groups of this form are the dihedral groups of order 2q (which corresponds to the case where m=1). This result stems from a detailed analysis of the structure of these groups and how their maximal product-free sets behave. When m > 1, the structure of the group of order 2q^m becomes more complex, and they no longer satisfy the conditions to be filled groups.\n\nTherefore, based on the specialized literature concerning filled groups, we can identify the specific family of groups that meet the criteria.\n\n**The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups of order 2q.** This corresponds to the case where m=1.\n\n<<<The dihedral groups of order 2q for any odd prime q.>>>"
