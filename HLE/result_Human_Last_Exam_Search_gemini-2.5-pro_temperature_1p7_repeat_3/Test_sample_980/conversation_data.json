    "An analysis of the provided number sequence suggests that it is not a standard mathematical progression. A search for the sequence reveals that the initial numbers, \"111, 142, 111,\" appear in the index of the book *The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire*, likely as page numbers. The numbers 111 and 142 also appear together in other academic or collection-related contexts, such as a citation \"111-142\" in another publication and as part of a Pok√©mon card's information, \"111/142\". The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) does not contain this specific sequence, further indicating it is not a known mathematical series.\n\nThe sequence itself displays internal patterns of repetition and palindromic structures. For example, it begins with the palindromic group `111, 142, 111` and later contains another, `49, 155, 49`. There are also several instances of repeated numbers, such as `67, 67, 67` and `124, 124, 124`.\n\nThe sequence ends with `..., 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`. The final two numbers, 36 and 124, appear to be the beginning of a new palindromic group. Following the pattern of `a, b, a` seen earlier in the sequence, it is logical to conclude that the next number should be 36, which would complete the pattern as `36, 124, 36`.\n\n<<<36>>>"
