    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant for any Calabi-Yau manifold is 0.\n\nA Calabi-Yau manifold is a complex manifold with a vanishing first Chern class, which implies that its canonical bundle is trivial. The Crawley-Nordström invariant is a concept from birational geometry, primarily defined for Fano varieties (which have an ample anti-canonical bundle). The invariant `cn(X)` is defined as the supremum of all real numbers `t ≥ 0` such that the divisor class `−K_X − tH` is pseudo-effective for every ample divisor `H` on the manifold `X`.\n\nFor a Calabi-Yau manifold, the canonical bundle `K_X` is trivial, meaning `K_X ~ 0`. Consequently, the anti-canonical bundle `−K_X` is also trivial. The defining condition for the Crawley-Nordström invariant simplifies to finding the supremum of `t ≥ 0` for which `−tH` is pseudo-effective. An ample divisor `H` has positive intersection with any curve. For any `t > 0`, the class `−tH` will have a negative intersection with any curve, meaning it cannot be pseudo-effective. Therefore, the only value for which the condition holds is `t = 0`. This makes the Crawley-Nordström invariant for any Calabi-Yau manifold equal to 0.\n\nThe specific Calabi-Yau link is described by the equation:\n$0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\nin the weighted projective space $W\\mathbb{P}^4(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\nFor a hypersurface in a weighted projective space to be Calabi-Yau, its degree must equal the sum of the weights. The sum of the given weights is $22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$. Checking the weighted degrees of the monomials in the equation reveals an inconsistency:\n*   `deg`( $z_1^8z_3$ ): $8 \\times 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n*   `deg`( $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ ): $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$\n*   `deg`( $z_1z_2^7$ ): $1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n*   `deg`( $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$ ): $22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$\n*   `deg`( $z_2z_3^4$ ): $29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$\n*   `deg`( $z_4^3z_5$ ): $3 \\times 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n*   `deg`( $z_5^3$ ): $3 \\times 75 = 225$\n\nThe polynomial is not homogeneous due to the second term, suggesting a typographical error in the provided equation. However, since the problem explicitly states that this represents a Calabi-Yau link, we rely on this classification. The property of being Calabi-Yau is sufficient to determine the invariant. It should be noted that the Crawley-Nördstrom invariant can also be defined for the associated G2-manifold of the link, but in the context of the birational invariant for the Calabi-Yau threefold itself, the value is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
