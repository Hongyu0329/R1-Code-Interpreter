    "The user is asking for the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix.\n\nFrom the search results, I can piece together the definitions and properties I need.\n\n1.  **Qudit Pauli Channel**: A Pauli channel is a quantum channel that maps a density matrix $\\rho$ to a linear combination of Pauli operators acting on $\\rho$. For a d-dimensional system (qudit), the generalized Pauli operators $P_{r,s}$ are defined based on the shift and clock matrices X and Z. A Pauli channel has the form $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{r,s=0}^{d-1} p_{r,s} P_{r,s} \\rho P_{r,s}^\\dagger$. The coefficients $p_{r,s}$ form a probability distribution.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel**: A quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be represented using a Stinespring dilation, $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$, where V is an isometry from the system's Hilbert space to a larger Hilbert space of the system and an environment E. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is obtained by tracing over the system instead of the environment: $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\n3.  **Kraus Operators**: A channel can also be described by Kraus operators $\\{K_i\\}$ such that $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_i K_i \\rho K_i^\\dagger$. For a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are proportional to the Pauli operators: $K_{r,s} = \\sqrt{p_{r,s}} P_{r,s}$. The number of Kraus operators is $d^2$.\n\n4.  **Rank of a Channel**: The rank of a channel is often referred to as the Choi rank, which is the rank of the Choi-Jamiołkowski state corresponding to the channel. The Choi rank is equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to represent the channel.\n\n5.  **Complementary Channel from Kraus Operators**: If the Kraus operators of a channel $\\Lambda$ are $\\{K_i\\}$, the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is given by $\\Lambda^c(X) = \\sum_{i,j} \\text{Tr}(K_i^\\dagger K_j X) |i\\rangle\\langle j|$. Here, the output space of the complementary channel is spanned by the basis states $|i\\rangle$. The dimension of this output space is the number of Kraus operators.\n\nLet's combine these concepts.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a d-dimensional qudit system has $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, $P_{r,s}$, where $r, s \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$. The action of the channel is:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{r,s=0}^{d-1} p_{r,s} P_{r,s} \\rho P_{r,s}^\\dagger$\nwhere $\\sum_{r,s} p_{r,s} = 1$ and $p_{r,s} \\ge 0$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $K_{r,s} = \\sqrt{p_{r,s}} P_{r,s}$.\nThere are $d^2$ such Kraus operators, indexed by the pair $(r,s)$.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps an operator $X$ on the input space to an operator on a space whose dimension is equal to the number of Kraus operators. Let's index the Kraus operators by a single index $k$ from $1$ to $d^2$.\n$\\Lambda^c(X) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^{d^2} \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l X) |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\n\nThe output of the complementary channel is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix. The rank of this channel is the rank of its output when the input is a full-rank state, or more formally, the dimension of the subspace spanned by the outputs.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the rank of the matrix $M$ with entries $M_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l X)$.\nLet's analyze the matrix elements:\n$M_{kl} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_k} P_k)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_l} P_l) X) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l X)$\nwhere $P_k$ and $P_l$ are generalized Pauli operators.\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators form a complete orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. Specifically, $\\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$.\n\nLet's consider the output of the complementary channel for a specific input, say $X = \\frac{1}{d} I$.\n$\\Lambda^c(\\frac{1}{d}I) = \\sum_{k,l} \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\frac{1}{d}I) |k\\rangle\\langle l| = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l) |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\nSince $\\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$, this simplifies to:\n$\\Lambda^c(\\frac{1}{d}I) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}) |k\\rangle\\langle l| = \\sum_k p_k |k\\rangle\\langle k|$\nThis is a diagonal matrix, and its rank is the number of non-zero $p_k$.\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to consider the case where the output space has the largest possible dimension. The output space of the complementary channel is a subspace of the space of $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices.\n\nLet's consider the Choi-Jamiołkowski state of the complementary channel, $J(\\Lambda^c)$. The rank of the channel is the rank of this state.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes \\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)$\n$\\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|) = \\sum_{k,l} \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l |i\\rangle\\langle j|) |k\\rangle\\langle l| = \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l |i\\rangle\\langle j|) |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\n\nLet the set of Kraus operators be $\\{K_k\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$. The complementary channel is defined as $\\Lambda^c(X) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^{d^2} \\mathrm{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l X) |k\\rangle \\langle l|$. The output space is a space of $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices. The rank of the complementary channel is the dimension of the image of $\\Lambda^c$.\n\nThe dimension of the image is at most the dimension of the domain, which is $d^2$, and at most the dimension of the codomain, which is $(d^2)^2$. However, the rank is typically defined as the Choi rank, which is the rank of the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$.\n\nThe Choi matrix of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is a $d \\times d^2$ by $d \\times d^2$ matrix. A more direct way to determine the rank is to find the number of linearly independent operators in the image of the channel.\n\nThe number of Kraus operators for a Pauli channel is $d^2$, corresponding to the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators. If all probabilities $p_{r,s}$ are non-zero, then we have $d^2$ Kraus operators.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the rank of the matrix $G$ with entries $G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l)$. In our case, $G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(\\sqrt{p_k}P_k^\\dagger \\sqrt{p_l}P_l) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l) = d\\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\delta_{kl}$. This is a diagonal matrix. Its rank is the number of non-zero $p_k$. If all $p_k > 0$, the rank is $d^2$. This is not the rank of the channel, but the rank of the Gram matrix of the Kraus operators.\n\nLet's go back to the definition of the complementary channel's output:\n$\\Lambda^c(X) = \\sum_{k,l} \\langle k| \\mathcal{K}(X) |l \\rangle |k\\rangle \\langle l|$, where $\\mathcal{K}(X)$ is an operator on the environment space defined by $\\mathcal{K}(X)_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l X)$.\nThe dimension of the environment is equal to the number of Kraus operators, which is at most $d^2$. Let's assume we have $d^2$ non-zero probabilities $p_{r,s}$, so there are $d^2$ Kraus operators. The environment has dimension $d^2$.\n\nThe complementary channel maps a state on a $d$-dimensional space to a state on a $d^2$-dimensional space.\n$\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_{d^2})$\n\nThe rank of a channel $\\Phi$ is the rank of its Choi matrix $J(\\Phi)$. The rank is also the dimension of the vector space spanned by the operators $K_i^\\dagger K_j$.\nFor the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, its Kraus operators are not immediately obvious from the definition.\n\nLet's use the Stinespring dilation.\nLet $\\{|k\\rangle\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$ be an orthonormal basis for the environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\nThe isometry $V$ for the channel $\\Lambda$ is given by:\n$V |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} (K_k |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} (\\sqrt{p_k} P_k |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle$.\n\nThe complementary channel is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nLet's take a basis for the input space, $\\{|i\\rangle\\}_{i=0}^{d-1}$. We compute $\\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)$:\n$\\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|) = \\text{Tr}_S(V |i\\rangle\\langle j| V^\\dagger)$\n$= \\text{Tr}_S \\left( \\left(\\sum_k \\sqrt{p_k} P_k |i\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle \\right) \\left(\\sum_l \\sqrt{p_l} \\langle j| P_l^\\dagger \\otimes \\langle l| \\right) \\right)$\n$= \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}_S ( (P_k|i\\rangle\\langle j|P_l^\\dagger) \\otimes (|k\\rangle\\langle l|) )$\n$= \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(P_k|i\\rangle\\langle j|P_l^\\dagger) |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\n$= \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\langle j|P_l^\\dagger P_k|i\\rangle |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\n\nThis is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix. The rank of the complementary channel is the dimension of the subspace of $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices spanned by the outputs $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ for all input density matrices $\\rho$.\nThis is equivalent to the dimension of the span of $\\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)$ for all $i,j$.\nThe space of operators $\\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)$ is spanned by the operators $|k\\rangle\\langle l|$ with coefficients $C_{ij}^{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\langle j|P_l^\\dagger P_k|i\\rangle$.\n\nLet's assume the most general case where all $d^2$ probabilities $p_{r,s}$ are non-zero. Then we have $d^2$ Kraus operators.\nThe matrix elements of the Pauli operators are non-zero in general. $P_{r,s} = X^r Z^s$.\nThe operators $P_k$ form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\nTherefore, the operators $P_l^\\dagger P_k$ also span the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nLet $A_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} P_l^\\dagger P_k$.\nThen $\\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|) = \\sum_{k,l} \\langle j| A_{kl} |i\\rangle |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nThis can be seen as a mapping from the space of input operators (represented in the basis $|i\\rangle\\langle j|$) to the space of output operators (represented in the basis $|k\\rangle\\langle l|$).\n\nLet's analyze the span of the output states. The output state $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ density matrix.\nThe rank of the *output state* $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ can be at most $d^2$. We are asked for the rank of the *channel*.\n\nThe Choi rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is the rank of the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes \\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)$.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{i,j,k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\langle j| P_l^\\dagger P_k | i \\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nLet's try to express this as a projector on a larger space.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\left( \\sum_{i,j} |i\\rangle \\langle j| \\langle j| P_l^\\dagger P_k |i\\rangle \\right) \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\nThe term in the parenthesis is $\\sum_i |i\\rangle\\langle i| (P_l^\\dagger P_k)^T = (P_l^\\dagger P_k)^T$. The transpose is with respect to the chosen basis.\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (P_l^\\dagger P_k)^T \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\n\nThis looks complicated. Let's try another approach. The rank of a channel is the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{K_i^\\dagger K_j\\}_{i,j}$.\nThe Kraus operators of the complementary channel are not the same as the original channel.\n\nLet's consider the dimension of the range of $\\Lambda^c$.\nThe range is the span of $\\{\\Lambda^c(\\rho) | \\rho \\text{ is a density matrix}\\}$. This is the same as the span of $\\{\\Lambda^c(X) | X \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)\\}$.\nThe space of operators $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ has dimension $d^2$. The basis is, for example, the set of Pauli operators $\\{P_m\\}$.\nSo let's calculate $\\Lambda^c(P_m)$.\n$\\Lambda^c(P_m) = \\sum_{k,l} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l P_m) |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nThe trace term is a generalized structure constant of the Pauli group algebra. $\\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l P_m)$ is non-zero if $P_l P_m$ is proportional to $P_k$. Since $P_k$ form a basis, $P_l P_m = \\sum_n c_n P_n$. So $\\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l P_m) = \\sum_n c_n \\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_n) = d \\cdot c_k$.\nSo we need to find the coefficient $c_k$ in the expansion $P_l P_m = c_k P_k + ...$. The Pauli group is a group, so $P_l P_m$ is proportional to another Pauli operator, let's say $P_n$, where the multiplication rule depends on the indices. $P_{r_1, s_1} P_{r_2, s_2} = \\omega^{s_1 r_2} P_{r_1+r_2, s_1+s_2}$. There is a phase factor. So $P_l P_m$ is not exactly $P_k$, but $\\omega^{\\phi} P_n$ for some phase $\\phi$ and index $n$. So $\\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l P_m)$ is non-zero only if $P_k$ is proportional to $P_l P_m$. This means $k$ is fixed by $l$ and $m$.\nSo for a given input basis element $P_m$, the output is $\\sum_{l} C_l |f(l,m)\\rangle \\langle l|$, where $f(l,m)$ is the index corresponding to the product $P_l P_m$.\n\nThis is getting too complex. There must be a simpler property.\nThe rank of a complementary channel is related to the number of Kraus operators of the original channel.\nFrom \"Complementary Channels and a Characterisation of Entanglement Breaking Channels\", the complementary channel $\\Phi^C$ is defined by $\\Phi^C(X) = \\sum_{i,j} \\text{Tr}(K_i^\\dagger K_j X) E_{ji}$, where $E_{ji} = |j\\rangle\\langle i|$. The output space is $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, where $d$ is the number of Kraus operators.\nFor a Pauli channel, we can have up to $d^2$ Kraus operators, if all probabilities $p_{r,s}$ are non-zero. Let $K_{r,s} = \\sqrt{p_{r,s}} P_{r,s}$. Let's index them with a single index $k \\in \\{1, ..., d^2\\}$.\nThe complementary channel is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^{d^2} \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) |l\\rangle\\langle k|$.\nThe output is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix. Let's call this matrix $M(\\rho)$.\nThe rank of the channel is the dimension of the subspace $\\{M(\\rho) | \\rho \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)\\}$.\nThe mapping $\\rho \\mapsto M(\\rho)$ is linear. So the dimension of the image is $\\text{dim}(\\text{Im}(\\Lambda^c))$.\n$\\text{dim}(\\text{dom}(\\Lambda^c)) = d^2$.\nFrom the rank-nullity theorem, $\\text{dim}(\\text{Im}(\\Lambda^c)) = \\text{dim}(\\text{dom}(\\Lambda^c)) - \\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(\\Lambda^c))$.\nLet's find the kernel. When is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)=0$?\n$\\sum_{k,l} \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) |l\\rangle\\langle k| = 0$.\nThis means $\\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) = 0$ for all $k,l$.\n$\\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l \\rho) = 0$.\nAssuming all $p_k > 0$, this is equivalent to $\\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l \\rho) = 0$ for all $k,l$.\nThe operators $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l}$ span the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\nTo see this, note that $\\{P_l\\}_l$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. So for any operator $A$, we can write $A = \\sum_l c_l P_l$. We can also write $P_k^\\dagger$ in this basis. So the products span the whole space.\nSo, $\\text{Tr}(A \\rho)=0$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. This implies $\\rho=0$.\nSo the kernel is trivial, ker($\\Lambda^c$) = {0}.\nThis means the dimension of the image is equal to the dimension of the domain, which is $d^2$.\nSo the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nLet's double-check the statement that $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l}$ spans $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\nLet's fix $k$. Then the set $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_l$ consists of $d^2$ operators. Since $P_k$ is invertible (unitary), multiplying by $P_k^\\dagger$ is an invertible linear map on the space of operators. So if $\\{P_l\\}_l$ is a basis, then $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_l$ is also a basis for any fixed $k$.\nSo yes, the set $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l}$ definitely spans $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\n\nSo, if all $d^2$ probabilities $p_{r,s}$ are non-zero, the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nIs it possible to have a rank higher than $d^2$?\nThe number of Kraus operators is at most $d^2$. Let the number of Kraus operators be $N$. Then the complementary channel maps to the space of $N \\times N$ matrices.\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^N \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) |l\\rangle\\langle k|$.\nThe dimension of the domain is $d^2$.\nThe dimension of the image is at most $d^2$.\nSo the rank cannot be greater than $d^2$.\n\nWhat if some probabilities $p_{r,s}$ are zero? Let's say we have $N < d^2$ non-zero probabilities. Then we have $N$ Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}_{k=1}^N$.\nThe complementary channel is $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^N \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) |l\\rangle\\langle k|$.\nThe output is an $N \\times N$ matrix.\nThe condition for the kernel is $\\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) = 0$ for all $k,l \\in \\{1,..,N\\}$.\nThis is $\\text{Tr}(\\sqrt{p_k p_l} P_k^\\dagger P_l \\rho) = 0$, which simplifies to $\\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l \\rho) = 0$ for all $k,l \\in \\{1,..,N\\}$.\nLet $S$ be the set of indices for which $p_k>0$. We need $\\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l \\rho)=0$ for all $k,l \\in S$.\nLet $\\mathcal{A}$ be the algebra generated by the Pauli operators $\\{P_k\\}_{k \\in S}$. The operators $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l \\in S}$ are a subset of the Pauli operators (up to a phase). Let this subset be $\\mathcal{P}_S$. We have $\\text{Tr}(A\\rho)=0$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{P}_S$.\nIf $\\mathcal{P}_S$ spans the entire space $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, then $\\rho=0$ and the rank is $d^2$. This would require $|S| \\ge d$. For example, if $S$ includes $\\{P_{r,0}\\}$ and $\\{P_{0,s}\\}$, then their products generate all Pauli operators.\nIf $\\mathcal{P}_S$ does not span the whole space, there could be a non-zero $\\rho$ in the kernel. The space spanned by $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l\\in S}$ is a subspace of $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\nThe dimension of the kernel is $d^2 - \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l\\in S})$.\nThe rank of the channel is $\\text{dim}(\\text{Im}) = d^2 - \\text{dim}(\\text{ker}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l\\in S})$.\nThe maximal value is achieved when the span is the largest.\nThe largest possible span is $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, which has dimension $d^2$. This is achieved when the set $\\{P_k\\}_{k \\in S}$ generates the full Pauli group. This happens if, for example, we take $P_{1,0} = X$ and $P_{0,1} = Z$. Their powers and products generate all $d^2$ Pauli operators.\nSo, if the set of non-zero probability Pauli operators includes the generators of the Pauli group, then the span of their products will be the full matrix algebra, the kernel of the complementary channel will be trivial, and its rank will be $d^2$.\n\nThe question is about the *maximal* rank. So we should choose the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ such that the rank of its complement $\\Lambda^c$ is maximized.\nBased on the analysis, the rank is at most $d^2$. And we have shown that a rank of $d^2$ is achievable. This happens when the Kraus operators correspond to a set of Pauli operators that generate the full Pauli group under multiplication (and taking adjoints), and when their associated probabilities are non-zero. The simplest case is when all $d^2$ Pauli operators have non-zero probabilities. In this case, the set $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l=1}^{d^2}$ spans the entire operator space $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, making the kernel of the complementary channel trivial.\nThe dimension of the domain of $\\Lambda^c$ is $d^2$. The dimension of the image (the rank) is $d^2 - \\text{dim(ker)}$. Since the kernel is trivial, the rank is $d^2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\nLet's check the terminology again. The rank of a channel can sometimes refer to the rank of the output state for a specific input, but \"rank of the channel\" usually means the Choi rank. Let's verify that my calculation of the dimension of the image is equivalent to the Choi rank.\n\nThe Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c$ is $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes \\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)$.\nThe rank of this matrix is the rank of the linear map that maps $|j\\rangle\\langle i|$ to $\\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)$. This map is exactly the channel $\\Lambda^c$ acting on the basis operators. The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the image of this linear map. This aligns with my previous reasoning.\n\nLet's review the steps.\n1.  A general Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional qudit is given by $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} p_k P_k \\rho P_k^\\dagger$, where $P_k$ are the generalized Pauli operators and $p_k \\ge 0$, $\\sum p_k = 1$.\n2.  The Kraus operators can be chosen as $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} P_k$. The number of Kraus operators, $N$, is the number of non-zero $p_k$. $N \\le d^2$.\n3.  The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is given by $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^N \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) |l\\rangle\\langle k|$, where $\\{|k\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for an $N$-dimensional space.\n4.  The rank of the channel $\\Lambda^c$ is the dimension of its image space, $\\text{Im}(\\Lambda^c)$.\n5.  By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\text{dim}(\\text{Im}(\\Lambda^c)) = \\text{dim}(\\text{dom}(\\Lambda^c)) - \\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(\\Lambda^c))$. The domain is $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, with dimension $d^2$.\n6.  An operator $\\rho$ is in the kernel of $\\Lambda^c$ if $\\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) = 0$ for all $k,l \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}$. This is equivalent to $\\text{Tr}((P_k^\\dagger P_l) \\rho) = 0$ for all $k,l$ where $p_k, p_l > 0$.\n7.  To maximize the rank, we need to minimize the kernel dimension. The kernel is minimized when the set of operators $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l \\in S}$ (where $S$ is the set of indices with $p_k>0$) spans the largest possible subspace of $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\n8.  The largest possible subspace is $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ itself, which has dimension $d^2$.\n9.  If $\\text{span}\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l \\in S} = \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, then $\\text{Tr}(A\\rho)=0$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, which implies $\\rho=0$. So, the kernel is trivial ($\\text{dim}(\\text{ker})=0$).\n10. The set $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l \\in S}$ spans $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ if the set $\\{P_k\\}_{k \\in S}$ generates the entire Pauli group. For example, if we choose $S$ to be the set of all $d^2$ indices (i.e., all $p_k > 0$), then $\\{P_k\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. Then for a fixed $l$, $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k}$ is also a basis, so the whole set $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}_{k,l}$ certainly spans $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\n11. Therefore, for a Pauli channel with $p_k > 0$ for all $k=1, ..., d^2$, the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2 - 0 = d^2$.\n12. Since the rank is at most the dimension of the domain ($d^2$), the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\nThe result seems solid. I will formulate the final answer.A Pauli channel, denoted by $\\Lambda$, is a quantum channel that transforms a qudit density matrix $\\rho$ into another qudit density matrix. The action of a Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined as:\n\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{r,s=0}^{d-1} p_{r,s} P_{r,s} \\rho P_{r,s}^\\dagger$\n\nHere, $P_{r,s}$ are the generalized Pauli operators, which form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $p_{r,s}$ are probabilities, meaning they are non-negative and sum to one.\n\nThe complementary channel, $\\Lambda^c$, describes the information that leaks to the environment. If the original channel $\\Lambda$ has Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$, its complementary channel can be expressed as:\n\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l} \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) |l\\rangle\\langle k|$\n\nFor a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators can be chosen as $K_{r,s} = \\sqrt{p_{r,s}} P_{r,s}$. Let's index these with a single integer $k$ from $1$ to $d^2$. The dimension of the output space of the complementary channel is determined by the number of Kraus operators used, which can be up to $d^2$.\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel, often referred to as the Choi rank, is the rank of its Choi-Jamiołkowski state. This rank is also equivalent to the dimension of the image of the channel map. The domain of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, which has a dimension of $d^2$. According to the rank-nullity theorem, the rank of the channel is the dimension of its domain minus the dimension of its kernel.\n\nAn operator $\\rho$ is in the kernel of $\\Lambda^c$ if $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = 0$. This implies that $\\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_l \\rho) = 0$ for all pairs of indices $k$ and $l$. For the Pauli channel, this condition becomes:\n\n$\\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(P_k^\\dagger P_l \\rho) = 0$\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we should consider the case that minimizes the dimension of the kernel. The maximal rank is achieved when the set of probabilities $\\{p_{r,s}\\}$ is chosen such that the kernel of the complementary channel is as small as possible. Let's assume all $p_{r,s}$ are non-zero. In this scenario, we have $d^2$ Kraus operators, and the condition for an operator $\\rho$ to be in the kernel simplifies to:\n\n$\\text{Tr}((P_k^\\dagger P_l) \\rho) = 0$ for all $k,l \\in \\{1, \\dots, d^2\\}$.\n\nThe set of operators $\\{P_k\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$ forms a basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices. Consequently, the set of all products $\\{P_k^\\dagger P_l\\}$ spans this entire space. Therefore, if the trace of the product of any operator in this spanning set with $\\rho$ is zero, $\\rho$ must be the zero operator. This means the kernel of $\\Lambda^c$ is trivial, i.e., its dimension is 0.\n\nGiven that the dimension of the domain of $\\Lambda^c$ is $d^2$, and for a suitable choice of the Pauli channel the kernel dimension is 0, the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2 - 0 = d^2$. Since the rank of the channel cannot exceed the dimension of its domain, this is the maximal possible rank.\n\nThus, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
