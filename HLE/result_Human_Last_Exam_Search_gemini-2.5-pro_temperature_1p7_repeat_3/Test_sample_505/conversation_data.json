    "In the standard surface code architecture, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single, contiguous patch is determined by the number of holes, or defects, introduced into that patch. For a standard planar surface code where holes have \"closed\" boundaries, the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **Logical Qubits per Patch:** Each patch of surface code has two holes. In the standard configuration, each hole allows for the encoding of one additional logical qubit. Therefore, a single patch with two holes can encode two logical qubits.\n\n*   **Total Logical Qubits:** The problem specifies two separate patches of surface code. Since the patches are distinct, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n\nTherefore, with two logical qubits encoded per patch, the total for two patches is:\n\n2 logical qubits/patch Ã— 2 patches = 4 logical qubits.\n\nIt is worth noting that more complex configurations exist. For instance, if the boundaries of the holes are mixed (containing both \"open\" and \"closed\" sections), a single patch with two holes could encode more qubits, but this is a more generalized and less standard case. Similarly, the arrangement of qubits within a patch affects the code's distance and its resilience to errors. However, based on the most common and straightforward implementation of surface codes with holes, the answer is four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
