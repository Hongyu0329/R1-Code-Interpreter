    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed, leading to the creation of **two diastereomeric isomers**.\n\nThe ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two ruthenium centers. The starting ruthenium complex, *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), is chiral and exists in two enantiomeric forms (Δ and Λ). The reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands on each of two ruthenium complexes.\n\nThe resulting dinuclear complex, [(bpy)2Ru(μ-dptztz)Ru(bpy)2]4+ (where bpy is bipyridine and μ-dptztz is the bridging ligand), can exist in different stereoisomeric forms depending on the combination of the chirality at the two metal centers. This leads to the formation of two distinct diastereoisomers that can be separated. These diastereomers are:\n*   A **meso (Δ/Λ)** form, which possesses a center of inversion.\n*   A **racemic (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ)** form, which contains a two-fold axis of rotation and consists of a pair of enantiomers.\n\nWhile the racemic form is a mixture of two enantiomers, they are diastereomeric to the meso form. Therefore, the reaction produces two separable diastereoisomers. Research has shown that these two diastereomers are formed in a 2:1 ratio.\n\n<<<2"
