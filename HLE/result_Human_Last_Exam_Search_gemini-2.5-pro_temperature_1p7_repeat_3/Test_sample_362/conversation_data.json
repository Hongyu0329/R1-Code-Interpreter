    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (Wittig reagent). In this specific reaction, pivalaldehyde (2,2-dimethylpropanal) reacts with (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n\nThe carbonyl group (C=O) of pivalaldehyde is replaced by the ethylidene group (=CH-CH₂-) from the Wittig reagent. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe chemical structures of the reactants are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde**: (CH₃)₃C-CHO\n*   **Wittig reagent**: Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) (where Ph is a phenyl group and the chloro group is on the 2-position of the phenyl ring)\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n(CH₃)₃C-CHO + Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) + Ph₃P=O\n\nThe resulting product is named **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry of the double bond, the nature of the ylide is important. The ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, is considered an unstabilized ylide because the carbon atom of the P=C bond is attached to an alkyl group. Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the (Z)-alkene (cis isomer) under kinetic control, especially in lithium-salt-free conditions. Therefore, the major product of this reaction is expected to be (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
