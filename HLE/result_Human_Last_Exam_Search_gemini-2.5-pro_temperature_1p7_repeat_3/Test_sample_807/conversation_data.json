    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is a fluorescent pink. This chemical compound is commonly known as Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye characterized by a bright, fluorescent pink or magenta hue. While its powdered form appears green, it dissolves in water to produce a vibrant pink.\n\nCrayola does not disclose the specific pigments used in their crayons, citing proprietary formulas. However, the company introduced a line of fluorescent crayons in 1972, which included colors that glow under black light. Among the original fluorescent colors was \"Ultra Pink,\" which was later renamed \"Shocking Pink\" in 1990. Other fluorescent pink crayons from Crayola include \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" and \"Hot Magenta\".\n\nRhodamine B is also identified by other names, including Basic Violet 10 and C.I. 45170. It is a widely used industrial colorant for products like textiles, paper, and paints. Given its distinct fluorescent pink color, it is logical to conclude that Rhodamine B is the pigment responsible for the color of Crayola's fluorescent pink crayons.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
