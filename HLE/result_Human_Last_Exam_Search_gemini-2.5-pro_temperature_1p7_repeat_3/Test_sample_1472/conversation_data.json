    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper ion.\n\nFor **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)**, the complex has a tetrahedral coordination geometry around the copper atom. The cation possesses a crystallographic S₄ axis, and its point group is **S₄**. This non-polar point group is relatively uncommon.\n\nFor **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)**, the complex exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry. The copper ion is coordinated to the four sulfur atoms of the two dithiahexane ligands in the equatorial plane and to two counter-ions (like tetrafluoroborate) in the axial positions. While the crystal structure belongs to the P2₁/c space group which is centrosymmetric, the individual complex cation [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]²⁺ is located on an inversion center, giving it a point group of **Cᵢ**.\n\nTherefore, the symmetry point group is S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex.\n\n<<<S₄ for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) and Cᵢ for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)>>>"
