    "The given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis equation is a first-order, second-degree nonlinear ordinary differential equation. A systematic approach to solving this equation is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Rearrange the equation**\n\nLet $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in terms of $p$:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p + (9x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n$y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1) p - x^{2}(y^2-9) = 0$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify with a substitution**\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can use the substitution $u = y^2$. This implies $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, and therefore $p = \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nSubstituting this into the rearranged equation gives:\n$x^2(u-9) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$\n\nMultiplying by 4, we get a differential equation for $u(x)$:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^{2} + 2x(x^2+1) \\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation for u(x)**\n\nThis is a type of nonlinear differential equation. We can seek a polynomial solution for $u(x)$. Let's try a solution of the form $u(x) = A - Bx^2$.\nThen, $\\frac{du}{dx} = -2Bx$.\nSubstituting this into the differential equation for $u$:\n$(-2Bx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(-2Bx) - 4x^2(A - Bx^2 - 9) = 0$\n$4B^2x^2 - 4Bx^2(x^2+1) - 4x^2(A - 9) + 4Bx^4 = 0$\n$4B^2x^2 - 4Bx^4 - 4Bx^2 - 4(A - 9)x^2 + 4Bx^4 = 0$\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n$(4B^2 - 4B - 4(A-9))x^2 = 0$\nFor this equation to hold for all $x$, the coefficient of $x^2$ must be zero:\n$B^2 - B - (A-9) = 0$\n\nLet $B=C$, where C is an arbitrary constant. Then we have $C^2 - C - (A-9) = 0$, which gives $A = C^2 - C + 9$.\nThus, a solution for $u(x)$ is $u = C^2 - C + 9 - Cx^2$.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back to find the general solution for y(x)**\n\nSince $u=y^2$, we have:\n$y^2 = C^2 - C + 9 - Cx^2$\n\nThis is the general solution to the differential equation. It can also be written in the implicit form:\n$y^2 + Cx^2 = C(C-1) + 9$\n\n**Singular Solutions**\n\nIn addition to the general solution, there may be singular solutions. By testing constant values for y, we can find that $y = 3$ and $y = -3$ are also solutions to the original equation. These can be obtained from the general solution by setting the constant $C=0$.\n\n<<<y^2 + Cx^2 = C(C-1) + 9>>>"
