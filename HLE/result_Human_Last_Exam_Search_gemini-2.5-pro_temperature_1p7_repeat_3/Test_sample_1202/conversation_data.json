    "After a gene is duplicated, it has several possible evolutionary fates. One of the most common is **pseudogenization**, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes non-functional. While this leads to divergence, it does not result in the *retention* of two functional genes. Another potential process is **gene conversion**, which involves the transfer of genetic material between the duplicate copies. This process tends to homogenize the genes, counteracting divergence, although it can also help spread new variants within a gene family. **Adaptive radiation** is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of diversification of a lineage, and while gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for it, it is not a mechanism for the retention of specific genes itself.\n\nTwo primary mechanisms are widely recognized for the retention and functional divergence of duplicated genes: neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is the process where one of the duplicated genes acquires a new, beneficial function through mutation, while the other copy continues to perform the original, ancestral function. This is an adaptive process that directly explains both the retention of the two copies (one for the old function, one for the new) and their divergence.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** occurs when the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (for example, being active in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, the two copies accumulate degenerative mutations that knock out complementary subsets of the original functions or expression patterns. As a result, both genes are required to be retained to carry out the full scope of the ancestral functions, a concept known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This partitioning of functions leads to their retention and divergence, primarily in their regulatory sequences.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are critical mechanisms. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial fate for duplicated genes because it can occur through neutral or nearly neutral degenerative mutations, which are far more common than the rare beneficial mutations required for a gene to gain an entirely new function (neofunctionalization). By providing a neutral pathway to preserving both gene copies, subfunctionalization can increase the longevity of duplicates in the genome, which in turn provides more evolutionary time for neofunctionalization to potentially occur later. Therefore, because it relies on more frequent mutational events, subfunctionalization is considered a highly probable mechanism for the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicated genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
