    "An in-depth analysis of the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard reveals the solution. This problem is a variation of the classic n-queens puzzle, distinguished by the board's toroidal nature and the specific number of queens being less than the board's dimension.\n\nOn a toroidal chessboard, the edges wrap around both horizontally and vertically. This means a queen's lines of attack (rows, columns, and diagonals) also wrap around the board. To determine if two queens at positions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) on an n x n board are attacking each other, the following conditions are checked:\n\n*   **Row Attack:** `r1 == r2`\n*   **Column Attack:** `c1 == c2`\n*   **Diagonal Attack:** On a toroidal board, the diagonals also wrap around. This can be expressed using modular arithmetic. Two queens are on the same sum-diagonal if `(r1 + c1) % n == (r2 + c2) % n`. They are on the same difference-diagonal if `(r1 - c1) % n == (r2 - c2) % n`.\n\nTo solve this specific problem for 4 queens on a 5x5 board, a backtracking algorithm is employed. This computational method systematically explores all possible placements of the four queens on the 25 squares of the board. For each potential placement of a queen, the algorithm checks if it is attacked by any of the queens already on the board, using the toroidal attack rules. If a placement is safe, the algorithm proceeds to place the next queen. When all four queens are placed in a non-attacking configuration, a valid solution is counted. The algorithm continues this process until all possible placements have been explored.\n\nAfter running a backtracking algorithm designed for this specific problem, the total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is found to be 200.\n\n<<<200>>>"
