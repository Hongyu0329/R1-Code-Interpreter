    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is **1-resolvable**.\n\nIn this context, a functor being *n-resolvable* refers to its homological dimension, specifically the length of its minimal projective resolution. A functor is called 1-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most 1. Such a functor can be expressed as the cokernel of a morphism between projective objects.\n\nThe key properties of the underlying categories lead to this conclusion:\n*   **Tame Functors:** A functor is \"tame\" if its behavior, even on a potentially infinite poset like an upper semilattice, is governed by a finite amount of information (specifically, it is a left Kan extension of a functor from a finite poset).\n*   **Upper Semilattices:** The structure of an upper semilattice is particularly well-behaved for indexing tame functors. When $J$ is an upper semilattice, the category of tame functors to vector spaces, denoted `tame(J, Vect_K)`, becomes an abelian category. This structure is essential for developing homological algebra.\n*   **Homological Properties:** Research shows that for a tame functor defined on an upper semilattice, it is not only possible to construct a minimal free resolution, but also that this resolution has a specific, limited length. The category `tame(J, Vect_K)` is shown to have a global dimension of at most 1, which means every object in it has a projective resolution of length at most 1.\n\nTherefore, any such functor is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
