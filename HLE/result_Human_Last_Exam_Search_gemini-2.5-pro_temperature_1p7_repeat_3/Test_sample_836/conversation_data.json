    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** or **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)** in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nNeutron noise analysis is a technique used in the nuclear criticality community to study the fluctuations in neutron flux within a reactor or other fissile material assembly. These fluctuations, or \"noise,\" provide valuable information about the system's kinetic parameters and can be used to monitor its state, such as its proximity to criticality.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function in this context describes the correlation between neutrons at different positions and at different times. The analysis of this correlation is often performed in the frequency domain. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function (a form of the pair correlation function for a single detector signal) with respect to time. This transform decomposes the neutron noise signal into its constituent frequencies, revealing characteristic signatures of the nuclear system.\n\nWhen correlations between signals from two different detectors are considered, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function is known as the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD). This technique is particularly useful for eliminating uncorrelated noise and extracting parameters like the prompt neutron decay constant, which is crucial for assessing criticality. The Rossi-alpha experiment, a foundational technique in neutron noise analysis, is directly related to measuring the time correlation between neutron detections, which is the basis for these frequency-domain analyses.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density (PSD) or Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)>>>"
