    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction becomes 2.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two topological systems are brought together such that there is no significant barrier between them, their respective topological characteristics combine. In this scenario, the \"negligible tunneling barrier\" implies that the two Chern insulators effectively merge into a single, larger system.\n\nEach of the original Chern insulators with a Chern number (C) of 1 possesses a single chiral edge state. When they are joined, the combined system will have a total of two chiral edge states propagating along its outer edges. This corresponds to a total Chern number of C = 1 + 1 = 2 for the junction.,\n\nThis principle is analogous to the stacking of Chern insulators, where multilayer structures can exhibit higher Chern numbers that are the sum of the individual layers' contributions. The number of conducting channels at the interface between two regions with different Chern numbers (C1 and C2) is determined by the difference |C1 - C2|. In this case, within the combined system, the interface between the two C=1 regions effectively vanishes, and the entire system is characterized by the sum of their Chern numbers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
