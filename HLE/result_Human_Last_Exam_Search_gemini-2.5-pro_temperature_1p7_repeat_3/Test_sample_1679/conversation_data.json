    "**An American in Paris (1951)** was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk. The iconic Parisian landmark is showcased during the film's celebrated and lengthy ballet sequence.\n\nThis elaborate, 17-minute dance number, which serves as the film's climax, takes place on a series of stylized sets designed to represent various famous locations in Paris. One of these sets is a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, where the real Luxor Obelisk stands. In the film's fantastical depiction, a replica of the obelisk is clearly visible in the background as Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron dance.\n\nWhile some earlier Best Picture winners had scenes set in Paris, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), extensive research, including reviews of filming locations and scene descriptions, reveals no evidence of the Place de la Concorde or its famous obelisk being depicted. Other winners with scenes in France, like *Wings* (1927), were set during World War I and did not feature Parisian landmarks. The majority of the early Best Picture winners were filmed on Hollywood backlots and studio sets, with *An American in Paris* being notable for its artistic and grand-scale recreation of the French capital.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
