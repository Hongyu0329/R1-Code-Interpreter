    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Ascarosepion bandense*, formerly *Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily other lobes within the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is located in the posterior part of the subesophageal mass.\n\nSpecifically, the following lobes are situated posteriorly to the main palliovisceral lobe:\n\n*   **Posterior chromatophore lobes (PC):** As their name suggests, these lobes are located towards the rear of the palliovisceral complex and are involved in controlling the chromatophores on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass.\n*   **Fin lobes (F):** These lobes, which control the movement of the fins, are also located within this posterior complex.\n*   **Dorsal and Ventral vasomotor lobes (DV, VV):** These lobes are part of the palliovisceral complex as well.\n\nA brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish shows the three-dimensional arrangement of these lobes, confirming their position relative to the palliovisceral lobe. The entire palliovisceral lobe complex is responsible for the lower motor control of locomotion, including escape movements and ink ejection, which are functions associated with the posterior of the animal.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes.>>>"
