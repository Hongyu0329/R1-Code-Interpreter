    "### Eigenvalues of Total Angular Momentum for a p-Electron\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is **l = 1**, and the spin angular momentum quantum number is **s = 1/2**. The total angular momentum, **J**, is the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta: **J** = **L** + **S**.\n\nThe total angular momentum operator, J², and its z-component, Jz, commute, meaning they share a common set of eigenstates and their eigenvalues can be determined simultaneously.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series, ranging from |l - s| to l + s in integer steps. For a p-electron:\n*   j = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   j = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThis leads to two possible states for the electron, characterized by j = 3/2 and j = 1/2. The eigenvalues of J² and Jz for each of these states are as follows:\n\n**1. For the state j = 3/2:**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²:** The eigenvalue of the J² operator is given by the formula ħ²j(j+1).\n    *   For j = 3/2, the eigenvalue is ħ²(3/2)(3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz:** The eigenvalues of the Jz operator are given by ħm_j, where m_j can take values from -j to +j in integer steps.\n    *   For j = 3/2, the possible values of m_j are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ**.\n\n**2. For the state j = 1/2:**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²:** Using the same formula, ħ²j(j+1):\n    *   For j = 1/2, the eigenvalue is ħ²(1/2)(1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz:** Following the rule for m_j:\n    *   For j = 1/2, the possible values of m_j are -1/2 and 1/2.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are **(-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ**.\n\nIn summary, the spin-orbit coupling splits the p-level into two manifolds, j = 3/2 and j = 1/2, each with its own set of allowed projections of the total angular momentum on the z-axis.\n\n<<<The common eigenvalues are:\nFor j = 3/2:\nJ² eigenvalue = (15/4)ħ²\nJz eigenvalues = (-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (3/2)ħ\n\nFor j = 1/2:\nJ² eigenvalue = (3/4)ħ²\nJz eigenvalues = (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ\n>>>"
