    "The commonly used name for the genus *Perdita* in their native range is \"fairy bee\" and also \"miner bee,\" with \"fairy bee\" being more specific to the genus, often attributed to their small size. The broader family Andrenidae, which includes *Perdita*, are collectively known as \"miner bees\" due to their practice of nesting in the ground.\n\nWhile the exact year the *genus* was first called \"fairy bee\" is not definitively documented in the search results, instances of individual species being given common names including \"fairy bee\" date back to the work of early entomologists. For example, *Perdita nevadensis*, described by T.D.A. Cockerell in 1896, is now known by the common name \"Nevada Fairy Bee\". Other species were given similar common names in the early 20th century, such as \"Ainslie's Fairy Bee\" (*Perdita ainsliei*, described in 1932) and \"Sandbar Willow Fairy Bee\" (*Perdita maculigera maculipennis*, described in 1910). The term \"fairy bee\" is used colloquially for *Perdita meconis* as well. Given that one of the earliest described species, from 1896, now carries the common name \"fairy bee,\" this suggests the name was likely coined around that time or in the early 1900s as more species of this genus were being discovered and named.\n\n<<<fairy bee, 1896>>>"
