    "Based on widely accepted preflop opening ranges for a 100BB cash game, the weakest suited jack that is typically considered a standard open from the button is J5s. While ranges can vary slightly depending on the specific chart or opponent tendencies, J5s is often cited as being at the bottom of the suited jack opening range from this position. Weaker suited jacks like J4s, J3s, and J2s are generally considered folds in a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
