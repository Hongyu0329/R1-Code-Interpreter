    "The thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is an integer that measures the \"p-adic distance\" between clusters of roots of the defining polynomial. The calculation involves finding a suitable model of the curve and analyzing the valuations of the roots of the polynomial.\n\nFirst, we find an isomorphic model of the curve $z^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ that is more suitable for analysis. A hyperelliptic curve defined by $z^2 = f(x)$ is isomorphic to a curve defined by $y^2 = c^{2g+2} f(x/c)$, where $g$ is the genus. For the given curve, the genus is $g=2$. By choosing the scaling factor $c=2$, we obtain the equation:\n\n$y^2 = 2^6 (2(x/2)^5 + 2(x/2)^3 + 1) = 64 (x^5/16 + x^3/4 + 1) = 4x^5 + 16x^3 + 64$.\n\nLet's call this new polynomial $f_2(x) = 4x^5+16x^3+64$. We analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f_2(x)$ using its Newton polygon. The vertices of the Newton polygon are determined by the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$ and $v$ is the 2-adic valuation normalized by $v(2)=1$. The points for $f_2(x)$ are $(5, v(4)=2)$, $(3, v(16)=4)$, and $(0, v(64)=6)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0, 6)$ to $(3, 4)$, with slope $(4-6)/(3-0) = -2/3$.\n2.  A segment from $(3, 4)$ to $(5, 2)$, with slope $(2-4)/(5-3) = -1$.\n\nAccording to the theory of Newton polygons, the valuations of the roots are the negatives of the slopes of the segments. This implies that the polynomial $f_2(x)$ has:\n*   Three roots with 2-adic valuation $v(r) = -(-2/3) = 2/3$.\n*   Two roots with 2-adic valuation $v(r) = -(-1) = 1$.\n\nThis indicates that the roots of the polynomial form two distinct clusters, which in turn suggests that the stable reduction of the curve has two components connected by a double point. The thickness of this double point can be calculated as the \"length\" of the bridge connecting the two components in the stable model. This length is given by the formula $L = n_1 \\cdot n_2 \\cdot d(C_1, C_2)$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the number of roots in each cluster, and $d(C_1, C_2)$ is the valuation of the difference between any two roots from the different clusters.\n\nIn our case:\n*   Cluster 1 has $n_1 = 3$ roots with valuation $2/3$.\n*   Cluster 2 has $n_2 = 2$ roots with valuation $1$.\n\nThe distance between the clusters is $d(C_1, C_2) = \\min(v(r_1-r_2))$ for $r_1 \\in C_1, r_2 \\in C_2$. By the properties of non-archimedean valuations, this is $\\min(v(r_1), v(r_2)) = \\min(2/3, 1) = 2/3$.\n\nTherefore, the thickness is calculated as:\n$L = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (2/3) = 4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
