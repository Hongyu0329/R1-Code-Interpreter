The value of the critical exponent ν is not a single, universally fixed number but depends on the dimensionality of the system and its underlying symmetries. The term "G₄-theoretical framework" is non-standard. If interpreted as φ⁴-theory for d=3 in the Ising universality class (n=1), ν ≈ 0.630. If interpreted as the 3D Anderson localization transition (G4 scaling), ν ≈ 1.57. A precise answer requires clarification of the framework.
