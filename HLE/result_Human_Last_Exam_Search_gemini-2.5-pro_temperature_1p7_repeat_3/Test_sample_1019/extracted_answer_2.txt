The d-threshold for Hamiltonicity in the specified range is \(p = \frac{16\eta}{n^2}\) for the case where \(\eta = \omega(1)\), which covers most of the range. For the case where \(\eta = \Theta(1)\), the threshold is \(p = \omega\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)\) and no sharp threshold exists. Therefore, a single expression for a sharp threshold across the entire range does not exist. The most specific sharp threshold result applies when \(\eta\) grows with \(n\).
