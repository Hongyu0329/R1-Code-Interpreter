    "Using large deviation theorems, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems, one can derive the equilibrium properties of a Bose gas of light quanta (photons). These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics used to describe such systems.\n\n### Theoretical Framework: Large Deviation Theory in Statistical Mechanics\n\nLarge deviation theory concerns the probabilities of rare events and provides a framework to quantify these probabilities. In statistical mechanics, the macroscopic state of a system corresponds to the average behavior of its microscopic constituents. Equilibrium is the most probable macroscopic state. Large deviation theorems are used to identify this most probable state and describe the probability of fluctuations away from it.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem relates the probability of an empirical distribution (the observed distribution of particles over states) to the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) with respect to a reference measure. For a system of particles, it essentially provides a rigorous justification for Boltzmann's formula, S = k log W, by showing that the probability of observing a particular macroscopic configuration is exponentially related to its entropy. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes this entropy under given constraints.\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability of large deviations of the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables from their expected value. In the context of a photon gas, it can be applied to the total energy of the system, which is the sum of the energies of individual photons. The theorem introduces a \"rate function\" that quantifies the exponential decay of the probability of observing a mean energy different from the equilibrium value. The equilibrium state corresponds to the minimum of this rate function.\n\n### Application to the Photon Gas (Bose Case)\n\nFor a gas of photons in a volume V, the following steps outline the derivation of equilibrium properties using large deviation principles:\n\n1.  **System Description**: The microstate of the system is defined by the number of photons, `n_s`, in each energy level `ε_s`. Photons are bosons, so any number of them can occupy a given energy level.\n2.  **Constraints**:\n    *   The total energy of the system is held constant at a mean value, E: Σs `n_s` `ε_s` = E.\n    *   The total number of photons is not conserved, which corresponds to a chemical potential of zero.\n3.  **Equilibrium Condition**: The equilibrium distribution of photons over the energy levels is found by maximizing the Boltzmann-Sanov entropy subject to the constraint on the mean energy. This is a variational problem that can be solved using Lagrange multipliers.\n4.  **Equilibrium Distribution**: The distribution that maximizes the entropy under these conditions is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for photons (with zero chemical potential):\n    ⟨n_s⟩ = 1 / (exp(βε_s) - 1)\n    where β = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n### Equilibrium Values of Mean Energy and Entropy\n\nOnce the equilibrium distribution is determined, the mean energy and entropy can be calculated by integrating over all possible photon energies. The energy of a photon with frequency ν is ε = hν, where h is Planck's constant. The density of states (number of available energy modes per unit volume per unit frequency) is g(ν) = (8πν²) / c³, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U or <E>)**\n\nThe total mean energy is found by integrating the energy of photons in each mode, multiplied by the average number of photons in that mode, over all frequencies:\n\nU = V ∫₀^∞ (hν) * (1 / (exp(hν/kT) - 1)) * (8πν²/c³) dν\n\nEvaluating this integral yields the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**:\n\nU = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴ = aVT⁴\n\nwhere `a` is the radiation constant. The mean energy of the photon gas is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nThe entropy of the photon gas at equilibrium can be derived from the mean energy using fundamental thermodynamic relations. For a photon gas, the pressure is P = U / (3V). The entropy is given by:\n\nS = (U + PV) / T = (U + U/3) / T = 4U / 3T\n\nSubstituting the expression for U, we get:\n\nS = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³ = (4/3)aVT³\n\nThese results, originally derived by Planck and Bose, are reproduced and placed on a firm probabilistic foundation by the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff large deviation theorems.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy (U):\nU = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴\n\nEquilibrium Entropy (S):\nS = (4/3) * (8π⁵k⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T³\n>>>"
