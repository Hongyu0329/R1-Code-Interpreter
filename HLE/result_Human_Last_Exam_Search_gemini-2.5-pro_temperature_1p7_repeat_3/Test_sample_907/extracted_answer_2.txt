The problem asks for the equation of the absorption cross-section for a chain of molecules under two different conditions, following an initial exciton creation at t=0. This implies we are considering an excited-state absorption from a one-exciton state to a two-exciton state. The general formula for the absorption cross-section `σ(ω)` based on first-order time-dependent perturbation theory is:

`σ(ω) = (π ω / (ε₀ħc n)) |d_if|² L(ω - ω_if)`

where `ω` is the photon frequency, `d_if = ⟨f|d|i⟩` is the transition dipole moment between the initial state `|i⟩` and final state `|f⟩`, `ω_if = (E_f - E_i) / ħ` is the transition frequency, and `L` is a line-shape function determined by the Gaussian laser pulse.

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**

In this case, the molecules are independent. The initial state is a single molecule `m` excited, `|i⟩ = |...e_m...⟩`, and the final state has a second molecule `k` excited, `|f⟩ = |...e_m...e_k...⟩`. The transition dipole moment is that of a single molecule's ground-to-excited transition, `d_if = d_ge`.

The absorption cross-section equation is:
**`σ(ω) = (π ω / (ε₀ħc n)) |d_ge|² L(ω - (E_e - E_g)/ħ)`**

where:
*   `d_ge`: Transition dipole moment of a single isolated molecule.
*   `E_e - E_g`: Excitation energy of a single molecule.
*   `ε₀, ħ, c, n`: Physical constants (permittivity, Planck's constant, speed of light, refractive index).
*   `L`: A Gaussian line-shape function reflecting the spectral profile of the ultrashort pulse.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.**

Here, excitations are delocalized Frenkel excitons. The initial state is a one-exciton state `|Ψ_1ex(k₁)⟩` with energy `E_1ex(k₁)`, and the final state is a two-exciton state `|Ψ_2ex(k_f)⟩` with energy `E_2ex(k_f)`. The transition dipole moment and energies depend on the collective properties of the chain.

The absorption cross-section equation is:
**`σ(ω, k₁) = (π ω / (ε₀ħc n)) |d_(1ex→2ex)(k₁, k_f)|² L(ω - (E_2ex(k_f) - E_1ex(k₁))/ħ)`**

where:
*   `k₁` and `k_f`: Wavevectors characterizing the delocalized one- and two-exciton states, respectively.
*   `d_(1ex→2ex)(k₁, k_f)`: The transition dipole moment between the collective one-exciton and two-exciton states. Its value is a function of the molecular transitio
