    "Based on a complete classification, there are 13 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. This classification was established by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. A product-free set is a subset of a group where the product of any two elements (including an element with itself) is not in the set. A set is maximal by inclusion if it cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without violating the product-free property.\n\nThe 13 finite groups are:\n*   **Abelian Groups (7 groups):**\n    *   The cyclic group C₄\n    *   The cyclic group C₅\n    *   The cyclic group C₆\n    *   The cyclic group C₇\n    *   The cyclic group C₈\n    *   The Klein four-group V₄ (also denoted as C₂ × C₂)\n    *   The group C₂ × C₄\n\n*   **Non-Abelian Groups (6 groups):**\n    *   The symmetric group S₃ (isomorphic to the dihedral group D₆)\n    *   The dihedral group D₈\n    *   The quaternion group Q₈\n    *   The dihedral group D₁₀\n    *   The alternating group A₄\n    *   A specific semidirect product group C₃ ⋊ C₄ of order 12\n\nThese groups were identified through a systematic analysis of the structural properties of a group `G` containing such a set `S`. A key result is that the subgroup generated by the set, `<S>`, must be a normal subgroup of `G`, with the corresponding quotient group `G/<S>` being either trivial or an elementary abelian 2-group. The final classification lists all possible isomorphism classes for the group `G`. While some sources might mention a different number, a direct analysis of the classification theorem in the original research paper confirms there are 13 such groups.\n\n<<<13>>>"
