    "Based on an analysis of Terraria's game mechanics, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players in the world. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its base health in Expert Mode is 3,640 for a single player.\n\nThe health scaling formula changes as more players join. For the second player, there's a 35% health increase. From the third to the ninth player, a more complex iterative formula is applied. For 10 or more players, the health multiplier is adjusted to be less drastic at higher player counts.\n\nThe formula for the health multiplier continues to increase with each additional player, and there is no known hard-coded cap on a boss's maximum health. Therefore, with a theoretical infinite number of players, the Eye of Cthulhu's health would also be infinite.\n\nHowever, in practice, a Terraria server has a maximum player limit of 255. According to community analysis of the game's code, the health multiplier for 255 players is approximately 171.3666.\n\nTo calculate the practical maximum health:\n*   **Base Health (Expert Mode):** 3,640 HP\n*   **Multiplier for 255 players:** 171.3666\n*   **Maximum Health:** 3,640 * 171.3666 = 623,793.584\n\nAfter rounding, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with the maximum number of players the game supports is approximately 623,794.\n\n<<<623794>>>"
