    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding how the system behaves before the complexities of particle interactions are considered.\n\nThe bare Green's function can be expressed in the energy-momentum (or frequency-momentum) domain. For a system of non-interacting fermions or bosons, the bare Green's function is a diagonal matrix in the basis of single-particle energy eigenstates. Its components are given by:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)** for ϵ_k > μ (unoccupied states)\n\nand\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k - iη)** for ϵ_k < μ (occupied states)\n\nHere:\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function for a particle with momentum **k** and energy (or frequency) **ω**.\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state with momentum **k**.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which separates occupied from unoccupied energy levels at zero temperature.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimal imaginary term that ensures the correct causal behavior of the propagator. The sign of this term depends on whether the energy level is above or below the chemical potential.\n\nThis relationship shows that the bare Green's function has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In other words, for a given momentum **k**, the Green's function becomes singular when the energy **ω** of the propagating particle matches its own energy eigenvalue **ϵ_k**. This singularity signifies the energy at which a non-interacting particle can exist. The inclusion of interactions modifies this simple picture, shifting these poles and introducing a finite lifetime for the particle, transforming it into a \"quasiparticle\".\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is that of a simple pole structure, where the denominator of the Green's function vanishes when the energy variable equals the energy eigenvalue.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function, G_0, on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k ± iη). This means that for a given momentum k, G₀ has a simple pole at the energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.>>>"
