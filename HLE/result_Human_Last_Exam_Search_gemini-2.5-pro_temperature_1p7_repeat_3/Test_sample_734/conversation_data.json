    "**Augustine of Hippo: Pioneering Theological Language for Alterations in Natural Law**\n\nThe Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the consequences of the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD). He introduced the concept of \"**rationes seminales**,\" or \"**seminal reasons**,\" a term he adapted from Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophy to explain how seemingly new or miraculous events could occur within God's created order.\n\nAugustine posited that at the moment of creation, God embedded these \"seminal reasons\" within the fabric of the universe. These are latent potentialities or \"seedlike principles\" for all things that would come into being over time. This framework allowed him to account for both the regular course of nature and for extraordinary events, or miracles, which he saw not as violations of God's natural order, but as the activation of these hidden potentials by divine will.\n\n**Application to the Virgin Birth:**\n\nFor Augustine, the virgin birth of Jesus was a prime example of a miracle explained through the *rationes seminales*. He argued that such an event was not contrary to nature in an absolute sense, but rather beyond the *usual* course of nature known to humanity. God, in this view, activated a pre-ordained potentiality within creation to bring about the birth of Christ from a virgin. This act demonstrated a change in the observable laws of nature, yet it was a possibility that God had woven into creation from the beginning. Augustine's writings explicitly state that the laws of nature were changed in the case of the virgin birth.\n\n**Application to the Fall:**\n\nAugustine also employed the concept of \"seminal reasons\" to explain the doctrine of original sin and the alteration of human nature after the Fall of Adam and Eve. He controversially taught that all of humanity was \"seminally present in the loins of Adam.\" Therefore, when Adam sinned, the entirety of the human race, existing in a \"seminal nature,\" was corrupted. This \"vitiated\" nature, including the tendency towards sin (concupiscence), was then passed down through generations. The state of human nature was thus fundamentally altered from its original, pre-lapsarian condition, a change explained through the transmission of this corrupted seminal identity.\n\nBy utilizing the single, specialized concept of *rationes seminales*, Augustine of Hippo was the first Christian theologian to provide a theoretical framework that could encompass both the miraculous singularity of the virgin birth and the inherited, universal change in human nature resulting from the Fall, describing both as alterations to the established natural order, orchestrated by God's sovereign will.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
