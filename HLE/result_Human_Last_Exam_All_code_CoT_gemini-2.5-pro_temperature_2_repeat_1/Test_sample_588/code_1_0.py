def solve():
    # The reasoning detailed in the thought process leads to a logical contradiction.
    # To summarize:
    # 1. A smooth, orientable 4-manifold to be "full" must admit a metric of index 3.
    # 2. The existence of an index 3 metric requires its second Stiefel-Whitney class, w_2, to be zero.
    # 3. For a connected sum N = M_1 # M_2 # ... # M_l, the condition w_2(N) = 0 implies w_2(M_i) = 0 for all i.
    # 4. For M(a,b) = M(a) x M(b), w_2(M(a,b)) = 0 if and only if a=1 and b=1.
    # 5. M(1,1) is full (it's the parallelizable 4-torus).
    # 6. The problem states that none of the M(a_i, b_i) can be full, so (a_i, b_i) cannot be (1,1).
    # 7. This implies w_2(M(a_i, b_i)) is never zero for any of the component manifolds.
    # 8. This in turn implies w_2(N) is never zero.
    # 9. Therefore, N can never be full.
    # The premises of the question are contradictory. Thus, no such tuple exists.
    # The answer should be an empty tuple.
    
    # We will print the characters representing an empty tuple.
