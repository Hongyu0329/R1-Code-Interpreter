# The goal is to find the second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only behavior (B22_steric).
# This is calculated using a hard-sphere model for the protein.
# The formula is: B22_steric = (Hard-Sphere Coefficient) * (Partial Specific Volume)

# The Hard-Sphere Coefficient is a dimensionless constant from statistical mechanics.
hard_sphere_coeff = 4

# The Partial Specific Volume (v_bar) for a typical monoclonal antibody is a standard value.
v_bar = 0.73  # units: mL/g

# Calculate the steric-only virial coefficient.
B22_steric = hard_sphere_coeff * v_bar
