    This function computes the clique number for the graph described in the problem,

    1. Defines the directed graph G_n based on the poset D_n.
       - Vertices are the integers 0 to n-1.
       - An edge (u, v) exists if u < v.

    2. Constructs the underlying undirected line graph X_un of G_n.
       - The vertices of X_un are the edges of G_n.
       - An edge exists in X_un between two vertices (representing edges e1 and e2 from G_n)
         if e1 and e2 share a common vertex in G_n.

    3. Computes and returns the clique number of X_un.

# If v1=u2, v2=u3, v3=u1 (a 3-cycle), it's impossible in G because u1 < v1 = u2 < v2 = u3 < v3 = u1 => u1 < u1.
