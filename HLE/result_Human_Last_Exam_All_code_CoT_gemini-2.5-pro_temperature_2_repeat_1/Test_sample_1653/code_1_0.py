# Based on heuristic arguments from potential theory and random walk exponents,
# the asymptotic behavior of h_k is believed to be a power law h_k ~ k^p.
# The calculation of the exponent p is a theoretical physics/mathematics problem.
#
# Let's outline a plausible line of reasoning that points towards p = -4.
# The problem is about a random walk on a 2D lattice. The probability for such a walk
# starting far away to hit a target region scales with the properties of harmonic functions
# in 2D.
# The probability of a 2D random walk starting at a large distance R from a point
# to ever hit that point decays very slowly, as ~ 1/ln(R).
# However, the probability of *not hitting* a target for a very long time given that the walk
# has already avoided another target is a more complex object.
# Heuristically, let's simplify the problem: we are interested in the influence of the set A_k
# (located near the origin) on the probability of hitting B_k (located at a distance
# of about k^2 from the origin). The influence or potential decays logarithmically, but the
# probability of certain long-time events often follows a power law.
#
# A very common exponent in 2D random walk problems is 2. The probability P(walk from distance R hits small set)
# scales like the derivative of the Green's function, G'(R) ~ 1/R. The probability squared might
# control the decay we are after, (1/R)^2. If R ~ k^2, we get (1/k^2)^2 = 1/k^4 = k^(-4).
# This gives the exponent -4.

p = -4

# The problem asks to calculate lim_{k->inf} ln(h_k)/ln(k).
# If h_k ~ k^p, then ln(h_k) ~ p * ln(k).
# So, ln(h_k)/ln(k) ~ p.
# The limit is the exponent p.
