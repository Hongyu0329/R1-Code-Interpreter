# Plan:
# 1. Determine the value of n_2, the number of vertices for the 2-planar graph.
#    - According to the problem's geometric constraints, a 2-planar graph must be bipartite.
#    - Bipartite graphs cannot have odd-length cycles like C₅.
#    - The condition that the graph has 'n' C₅ cycles can only be satisfied if n = 0, because the actual number of C₅ cycles is 0.
#    - Therefore, n_2 must be 0.
n_2 = 0

# 2. Determine the value of n_3, the number of vertices for the 3-planar graph.
#    - A 3-planar graph must be tripartite. Tripartite graphs can have C₅ cycles, so a non-zero n_3 might exist.
#    - However, the final formula is (n_2 + n_3) * n_2. Since n_2 is 0, the entire expression will be 0, regardless of n_3's value.
#    - We can use a placeholder for n_3 to demonstrate the calculation.
n_3 = 30  # Placeholder value, its actual value is not needed.

# 3. Calculate the final result using the formula (n_2 + n_3) * n_2.
result = (n_2 + n_3) * n_2

# 4. Print the final equation with all numbers, as requested.
print(f"Based on the analysis, n_2 must be 0 due to a contradiction in the problem statement for the 2-planar case.")
print(f"The value of n_3 is not required for the final calculation.")
print(f"The calculation is:")
print(f"({n_2} + {n_3}) * {n_2} = {result}")

# The final numerical answer enclosed in <<<>>>
print("<<<0>>>")
