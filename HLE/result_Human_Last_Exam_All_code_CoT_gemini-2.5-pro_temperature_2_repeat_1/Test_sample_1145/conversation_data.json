    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **State the Formula:** The probability `P` of finding a particle in a 1D box between positions `x1` and `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψn(x)|²`, over that interval.\n\n2.  **Probability Density:** The normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is `ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`. The probability density is `|ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)`.\n\n3.  **Perform Integration:** We need to compute the definite integral:\n    `P = ∫ (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx` from `x1` to `x2`.\n    The analytical solution to this integral is:\n    `P = [x/a - (1/(2nπ)) * sin(2nπx/a)]` evaluated from `x1` to `x2`.\n\n4.  **Substitute Values:** We will substitute the given values into the resulting formula:\n    *   Quantum number, `n = 2`\n    *   Lower bound of the interval, `x1 = 0.495a`\n    *   Upper bound of the interval, `x2 = 0.505a`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** The Python code will perform the numerical calculation and print the final equation with the numbers plugged in, along with the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a given interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given parameters\n    n = 2\n    # The interval is defined in terms of the box length 'a'. We can use normalized\n    # coordinates where a=1, as 'a' cancels out in the final formula.\n    x1 = 0.495\n    x2 = 0.505\n\n    # The analytical solution for the probability P is:\n    # P = [x - (1/(2*n*pi)) * sin(2*n*pi*x)] from x1 to x2\n    \n    # Calculate each term of the equation\n    delta_x = x2 - x1\n    \n    arg1_sin = 2 * n * math.pi * x1\n    arg2_sin = 2 * n * math.pi * x2\n    \n    sin_term = math.sin(arg2_sin) - math.sin(arg1_sin)\n    \n    coeff = 1 / (2 * n * math.pi)\n    \n    # Calculate the final probability\n    probability = delta_x - coeff * sin_term\n\n    # Print the final equation with all numbers substituted\n    print(\"The final equation for the probability is:\")\n    print(f\"P = ({x2} - {x1}) - (1 / (2 * {n} * pi)) * (sin(2 * {n} * pi * {x2}) - sin(2 * {n} * pi * {x1}))\")\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(\"\\nCalculated Probability:\")\n    print(f\"P = {probability}\")\n\ncalculate_probability()\n<<<0.000006579731113444431>>>"
