    "My plan is to first identify the specific historical event, which is the major defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng during the Lam Sơn uprising in Vietnam. Then, I will pinpoint the geographical location of this battle. Finally, I will determine the corresponding modern Vietnamese province for that location and present this information using a Python script as requested.\n\nThe battle in question occurred in late 1427. While a larger Ming army under Wang Tong was defeated earlier in 1426 at Tốt Động – Chúc Động (modern-day Hanoi), Mu Sheng's first major *personal* defeat happened when he was leading a relief army from Yunnan. Upon hearing that the other Ming relief army under Liu Sheng was annihilated, Mu Sheng's forces panicked and retreated. Lê Lợi's forces pursued and routed Mu Sheng's army at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá, along the Lo River (Sông Lô). This area is located in modern-day Phú Thọ Province.\n\nI will now generate the Python code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the modern Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng\n    suffered his first major personal defeat during the Lam Sơn uprising.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The year of the defeat was 1427.\n    year_of_defeat = 1427\n    \n    # The general's name.\n    general_name = \"Mu Sheng\"\n    \n    # The historical battle took place at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá, along the Lo River.\n    # This geographical area corresponds to the modern-day province of Phú Thọ.\n    province_name = \"Phú Thọ\"\n\n    print(f\"The Ming General {general_name} experienced his first major personal defeat in the year {year_of_defeat}.\")\n    print(f\"This happened while his army was retreating and was routed by Vietnamese forces.\")\n    print(f\"The location of this battle corresponds to the current Vietnamese province of: {province_name}\")\n\nfind_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Phú Thọ>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
