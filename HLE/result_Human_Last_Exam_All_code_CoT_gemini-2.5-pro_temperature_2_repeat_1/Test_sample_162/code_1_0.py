    # The reasoning behind the conclusion
    analysis = """
    To determine the source of Dilp2 driving neural stem cell reactivation, we must analyze the results of the different manipulations described.

    1.  Evidence for the Hemolymph Pathway (Dilp2 secreted to the hemolymph):
        *   The key experiment is overexpressing the Dilp2-binding protein, Imp-L2, in the fat body.
        *   This action specifically removes or "soaks up" Dilp2 from the hemolymph (the fly's blood).
        *   The result is a complete failure of neural stem cell reactivation.
        *   This loss-of-function evidence is very strong: if removing Dilp2 from the hemolymph prevents reactivation, then hemolymph Dilp2 is essential for reactivation.

    2.  Evidence for the Neuronal Transport Pathway (Dilp2 transported to DRNs):
        *   Inhibiting the activity of the DRNs, the neurons that receive Dilp2, causes only a "delay" in reactivation, not a complete failure.
        *   This suggests that this pathway modulates the timing or efficiency of the process but is not the primary trigger. The effect is less severe than blocking the hemolymph pathway.

    3.  Conclusion:
        *   The most direct and compelling evidence points to the Dilp2 secreted into the hemolymph. Blocking this source completely prevents neural stem cell reactivation, indicating it is the essential pathway. The neuronal pathway appears to play a secondary or modulatory role.
