    "My plan is to address your question by identifying the specific quote from Fernand Braudel, which he attributes to Paul Morand. The quote itself contains the answer. I will use a simple Python script to store the translated quote in a variable and then extract and print the key term, which is the \"conceptual entity\" you are asking about.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on the provided historical quote.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Fernand Braudel, in his work, quotes the writer Paul Morand.\n    # The original French quote is: \"La politique doit, pour être juste, s'inscrire sur une sphère.\"\n    # The English translation makes the subject of the sentence clear.\n    translated_quote = \"Politics, to be accurate, must be inscribed on a sphere.\"\n\n    # The \"conceptual entity\" is the subject of this sentence.\n    # The reference to \"the symbol of a nation\" is an example of a political element\n    # that needs to be viewed from this broader, global (\"spherical\") perspective.\n    entity = \"Politics\"\n\n    print(\"The quote provided is: '\" + translated_quote + \"'\")\n    print(\"The conceptual entity in this quote is the subject of the sentence.\")\n    print(\"Final entity identified: \" + entity)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Politics>>>"
