    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the rule of the elementary cellular automaton and the state of the intermediate row. Since there are only 256 possible rules for an elementary cellular automaton, we can systematically test each one.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Represent the top and bottom rows as lists of integers (0s and 1s). The top row is `01101001` and the bottom row is `10000111`.\n2.  Iterate through every possible rule, from rule 0 to rule 255.\n3.  For each rule, I will perform a two-step simulation:\n    a.  Apply the current rule to the `top_row` to generate a candidate `intermediate_row`. I'll assume periodic boundary conditions, which is standard practice (the right neighbor of the last cell is the first cell, and the left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell).\n    b.  Apply the *same* rule to this `intermediate_row` to generate a `calculated_bottom_row`.\n4.  Compare the `calculated_bottom_row` with the given `bottom_row`.\n5.  If they match, we have found the correct rule and the correct `intermediate_row`. Since the problem states there is only one valid solution, this will be our answer.\n6.  Finally, I will print the complete three-row sequence as requested and the intermediate row in the special format.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-step cellular automaton evolution by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    top_row_str = \"01101001\"\n    bottom_row_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    top_row = [int(c) for c in top_row_str]\n    bottom_row = [int(c) for c in bottom_row_str]\n    n = len(top_row)\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible elementary rules\n    for rule_number in range(256):\n        # The rule's binary representation defines the output for each of the 8 possible neighbor triplets\n        # The standard Wolfram convention orders triplets from '111' down to '000'\n        rule_bin = format(rule_number, '08b')\n        rule_map = {\n            (1, 1, 1): int(rule_bin[0]),\n            (1, 1, 0): int(rule_bin[1]),\n            (1, 0, 1): int(rule_bin[2]),\n            (1, 0, 0): int(rule_bin[3]),\n            (0, 1, 1): int(rule_bin[4]),\n            (0, 1, 0): int(rule_bin[5]),\n            (0, 0, 1): int(rule_bin[6]),\n            (0, 0, 0): int(rule_bin[7]),\n        }\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate the intermediate row from the top row\n        intermediate_row = [0] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighbors using periodic boundary conditions\n            left = top_row[(i - 1) % n]\n            center = top_row[i]\n            right = top_row[(i + 1) % n]\n            triplet = (left, center, right)\n            intermediate_row[i] = rule_map[triplet]\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate the bottom row from the intermediate row\n        calculated_bottom_row = [0] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighbors using periodic boundary conditions\n            left = intermediate_row[(i - 1) % n]\n            center = intermediate_row[i]\n            right = intermediate_row[(i + 1) % n]\n            triplet = (left, center, right)\n            calculated_bottom_row[i] = rule_map[triplet]\n        \n        # Check if the calculated bottom row matches the target bottom row\n        if calculated_bottom_row == bottom_row:\n            intermediate_row_str = \"\".join(map(str, intermediate_row))\n            print(top_row_str)\n            print(intermediate_row_str)\n            print(bottom_row_str)\n            # This is the unique solution\n            print(f\"<<<{intermediate_row_str}>>>\")\n            return\n\nsolve_cellular_automaton()\n```"
