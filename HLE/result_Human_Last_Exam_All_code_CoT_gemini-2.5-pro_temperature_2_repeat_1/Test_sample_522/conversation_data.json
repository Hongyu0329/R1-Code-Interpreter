    "This problem requires us to deduce a transformation rule from the given input-output pairs and then apply it to a new input to find the missing output.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Parse the data**: The input and output strings are comma-separated rows of digits, representing a grid. The digits are '0', '1', and '2'.\n\n2.  **Identify the core transformation**: In both `Input_A` -> `Output_A` and `Input_B` -> `Output_B`, the transformation involves a single '2' changing its position with a '0'.\n    *   In A, the '2' at `(1, 1)` moves to `(0, 0)`. This is a top-left diagonal move.\n    *   In B, the '2' at `(3, 6)` moves to `(2, 7)`. This is a top-right diagonal move.\n\n3.  **Formulate a movement rule**: This suggests the '2' attempts to move diagonally upwards. Let's establish a priority for these moves. Let's assume it first tries to move Top-Left (TL), and if not possible, then Top-Right (TR).\n    *   For **A**: '2' is at `(1,1)`. Its TL neighbor `(0,0)` is a '0', so it can move there. The move is executed. This matches `Output_A`.\n    *   For **B**: '2' is at `(3,6)`. Its TL neighbor `(2,5)` is '0'. According to our priority `TL > TR`, it should move here. However, `Output_B` shows a move to `(2,7)` (TR). This contradicts the priority.\n    *   Let's reverse the priority: first try Top-Right (TR), then Top-Left (TL).\n        *   **A**: `2` at `(1,1)`. TR neighbor `(0,2)` is '1', so the move is blocked. It then tries TL. Neighbor `(0,0)` is '0'. The move is made. Correct.\n        *   **B**: `2` at `(3,6)`. TR neighbor `(2,7)` is '0'. The move is made. Correct.\n        This priority (`TR > TL`) seems to work.\n\n4.  **Investigate the `MISSING` case**: For `Input_C`, the output is `MISSING`. This implies a special condition is met (or not met) that prevents the transformation.\n    *   `Input_C` Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at `(1, 4)`. Let's apply our `TR > TL` rule. The TR neighbor `(0, 5)` is a '0'. The rule would predict a move, but the output is `MISSING`.\n    *   This means there's an additional condition. Let's examine the neighbors of the '2' in the cases where a move occurs. The moves seem to be a \"jump\" or \"wall-kick\", where the '2' uses an adjacent '1' for support.\n        *   **A (TL move from (1,1))**: The 'T' neighbor is `(0,1)='0'`, 'L' neighbor is `(1,0)='1'`. Support from the left '1' seems plausible.\n        *   **B (TR move from (3,6))**: 'T' neighbor `(2,6)='0'`, 'R' neighbor `(3,7)='1'`. Support from the right '1'.\n        *   Let's formalize this: For a move to a '0' destination to be valid, one of the two adjacent \"supporting\" cells must be a '1'.\n            *   For a TL move: T or L neighbor must be '1'.\n            *   For a TR move: T or R neighbor must be '1'.\n    *   Let's re-check our `TR > TL` rule with this support condition:\n        *   **A**: Try TR from `(1,1)`. Fails (target is '1'). Try TL. Target `(0,0)` is '0'. Support check: `T='0'`, `L='1'`. `'0'=='1' OR '1'=='1'` is True. Move is valid. Correct.\n        *   **B**: Try TR from `(3,6)`. Target `(2,7)` is '0'. Support check: `T='0'`, `R='1'`. `'0'=='1' OR '1'=='1'` is True. Move is valid. Correct.\n        *   **C**: Try TR from `(1,4)`. Target `(0,5)` is '0'. Support check: `T='0'`, `R='0'`. `'0'=='1' OR '0'=='1'` is False. The move is invalid. The rule then checks TL. Target `(0,3)` is '0'. Support check: `T='0'`, `L='1'`. This is valid! So a TL move would occur. This doesn't explain `MISSING`.\n\n5.  **Final Hypothesis**: There must be another, simpler condition causing `MISSING` in `Input_C`. Let's examine a unique property of `Input_C`. The grid width is 6 (columns 0 to 5). The '2' is at column 4. In A, the '2' is at column 1 (width 6). In B, it's at column 6 (width 13).\n    *   Let's propose a blocking rule: if the '2' is located at column `width - 2`, the transformation is blocked and results in `MISSING`.\n    *   **A**: '2' at `(1,1)`. Width=6. `1 != 6 - 2 = 4`. Rule doesn't apply. Correct.\n    *   **B**: '2' at `(3,6)`. Width=13. `6 != 13 - 2 = 11`. Rule doesn't apply. Correct.\n    *   **C**: '2' at `(1,4)`. Width=6. `4 == 6 - 2 = 4`. Rule applies. The output is `MISSING`. Correct.\n\nThis hypothesis consistently explains all three examples. The value for `MISSING` is therefore the string \"MISSING\" itself.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle based on the derived rules.\n    The primary rule is that if a '2' is found at column index W-2 (where W is grid width),\n    the output is 'MISSING'.
