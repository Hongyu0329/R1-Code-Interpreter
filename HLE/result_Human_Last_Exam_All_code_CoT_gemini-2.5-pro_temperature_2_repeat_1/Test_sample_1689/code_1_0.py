    # C. Topical steroid: This is a treatment, not a diagnostic step.
    # D. Patch test: This is the gold-standard test to identify the specific allergen in suspected allergic contact dermatitis.

The patient's history and the physical examination findings, particularly the distribution of the rash on the posterior axillary folds while sparing the vault, are classic for textile contact dermatitis. The goal of the diagnostic workup is to confirm this suspicion and identify the specific allergen.

- A skin biopsy (A) is not indicated as a first-line test.
- A KOH preparation (B) could rule out a fungal infection, but it would not confirm the primary suspicion.
- A topical steroid (C) is a treatment, not a diagnostic investigation.
- A patch test (D) is the definitive diagnostic procedure to identify the causative agent in allergic contact dermatitis.

Therefore, the best next step is to perform a patch test.
