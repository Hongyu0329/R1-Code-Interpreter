              "violates the separation of concerns principle, and makes the logic difficult to test and reuse."),

        'B': ("Inappropriate. Putting all the logic into the Order class makes it a 'God Object' and violates the "
              "Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Logic related to customer discounts belongs with the Customer, "
              "inventory belongs with the Book, and infrastructure concerns like sending emails should not be directly "
              "coupled with a domain entity."),

        'C': ("Inappropriate. While this option attempts to distribute responsibilities, it fails to account for the "
              "orchestration logic required to create an order. An order placement process coordinates between multiple "
              "entities (Customer, Book). This coordination logic doesn't naturally belong in any single entity and "
              "is a prime candidate for a Domain Service."),

              "any single entity. The process of placing an order, which coordinates between a Customer and Books, is a "
              "perfect example. The service orchestrates the high-level flow."),

        'E': ("Appropriate. This is often the ideal approach. It combines a Rich Domain Model (where entities like Order "
              "have their own intrinsic logic) with Domain Services that orchestrate processes spanning multiple entities. "
              "This balances responsibilities effectively.")
