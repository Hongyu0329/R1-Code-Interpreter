    # --- Step 1: Analyze the incident involving Mark ---
    print("\nIncident 1: Mark and the damaged pool.")
    print("  - Mark was negligent: He was distracted and failed to safely operate the lawnmower, directly causing the damage. Thus, Mark is liable.")
    print("  - Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. is the employer: Under the principle of vicarious liability, Evergreen is liable for the negligent acts of its employee (Mark) committed during his employment.")
    print("  - Therefore, for the pool damage, Mark and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. are jointly and severally liable.")
    print("  - The neighbours are not liable, as their connection to the event (owning the dog and having a low fence) is too indirect. The direct cause was Mark's own negligence.")

    print("\n-----------------------------------------")

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the incident involving Lincoln ---
    print("\nIncident 2: Lincoln and the scratched Ferrari.")
    print("  - Lincoln was negligent: He should have foreseen that blowing rocks with a powerful blower near a car would cause damage. Thus, Lincoln is liable.")
    print("  - The extent of the damage (small scratches) affects the amount of compensation owed, but it does not eliminate liability itself.")
    print("  - Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. is the employer: Similar to the first incident, Evergreen is vicariously liable for Lincoln's negligence because he was performing his job duties.")
    print("  - Therefore, for the car damage, Lincoln and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. are jointly and severally liable.")

    print("\n-----------------------------------------")

    # --- Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the analysis ---
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The correct answer must state that:")
    print("1. For the pool damage, Evergreen and Mark are jointly and severally liable.")
    print("2. For the car damage, Evergreen and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable.")
    print("\nThis matches option E.")

    correct_answer_text = "E. Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. and Mark are jointly and severally liable for the damage that resulted from Mark's actions.  Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable for the damage that resulted from Lincoln's actions."
