def find_transience_infimum():
    """
    This script finds the infimum of the set of values 'c' for which a given
    Markov chain is transient.

    The method involves:
    1. Calculating the first and second moments of the jumps from a state k.
    2. Setting up a differential equation for a Lyapunov function f(k) based on
       these moments.
    3. Solving the ODE to find the form of f(k).
    4. Applying Lamperti's criterion for transience/recurrence based on whether
       f(k) is bounded or unbounded as k -> infinity.
    5. Solving for the critical value of c that separates these two behaviors.
