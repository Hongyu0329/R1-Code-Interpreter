    "In the context of the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, serves as the propagator for a single, non-interacting particle. To understand its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, it's most convenient to work in the frequency-momentum space.\n\nThe relationship is defined by the following formula for the Feynman propagator:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n*   **$G_0(k, \\omega)$**: The bare Green's function for a state with quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum) and frequency $\\omega$.\n*   **$\\epsilon_k$**: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state $k$. This is the term of interest.\n*   **$\\omega$**: The frequency variable.\n*   **$\\mu$**: The chemical potential, which establishes the Fermi energy level.\n*   **$i\\delta$**: An infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. The sign of $\\delta$ depends on whether the state $\\epsilon_k$ is above or below the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n    *   For particle states (unoccupied, $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$), the term is $+i\\eta$.\n    *   For hole states (occupied, $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$), the term is $-i\\eta$, where $\\eta$ is a small positive real number.\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a term that is linear in the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The function has a simple pole where the denominator approaches zero, which corresponds to the physical energy of the quasi-particle.\n\nThe following Python script will print out this formula and clarify the different cases.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the formula for the bare Green's function G_0,\n# explicitly showing its dependence on the single-particle energy epsilon_k.\n\nprint(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy epsilon_k is an inverse linear relationship.\")\nprint(\"The general formula is:\")\nprint(\"\\n  G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - (epsilon_k - mu) + i*delta)\\n\")\nprint(\"Where:\")\nprint(\"  G_0      : The bare Green's function.\")\nprint(\"  k        : The quantum number of the single-particle state (e.g., momentum).\")\nprint(\"  omega    : The frequency.\")\nprint(\"  epsilon_k: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for state k.\")\nprint(\"  mu       : The chemical potential.\")\nprint(\"  i        : The imaginary unit.\")\nprint(\"  delta    : A small infinitesimal whose sign depends on the state's energy relative to the chemical potential.\")\nprint(\"\\nThis general form can be broken down into two specific cases:\")\n\n# Case 1: Particle state (unoccupied level)\nprint(\"\\n1. For a particle state where epsilon_k > mu (an unoccupied level):\")\nprint(\"   The term delta is positive (+eta, where eta is a small positive number).\")\nprint(\"   The final equation is:\")\nprint(\"   G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + mu + i*eta)\")\n\n# Case 2: Hole state (occupied level)\nprint(\"\\n2. For a hole state where epsilon_k < mu (an occupied level):\")\nprint(\"   The term delta is negative (-eta).\")\nprint(\"   The final equation is:\")\nprint(\"   G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + mu - i*eta)\")\n\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ exhibits an inverse linear dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$, as shown by the formula: $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$.>>>"
