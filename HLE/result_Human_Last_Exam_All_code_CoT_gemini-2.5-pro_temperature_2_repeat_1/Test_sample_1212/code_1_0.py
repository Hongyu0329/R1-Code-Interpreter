    This script analyzes the provided Go puzzle to find all killing moves for White.

    Board State Analysis:
    - Black Stones: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1 form a single connected group.
    - White Stones: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5 are surrounding the black group.
    - It is White's turn to move.

    Liberty Analysis:
    The black group's liberties (empty adjacent points) are:
    1. A1 (touches A2 and C1)
    2. B1 (touches C1)
    3. A3 (touches A2 and B3)
    4. A4 (touches B4)
    5. B2 (an internal point, touching A2, B3, B4, and C2)

    Candidate Move Evaluation:
    White must play on one of these five liberties to kill the group.

    1. Move at B2: Playing at B2 would place a white stone in a position with no
       liberties of its own, without capturing any black stones on the same turn.
       This is a suicide move, which is illegal in Go. So, White cannot play at B2.

    2. Moves at A1, B1, A3, A4: These are the "external" liberties. Let's analyze playing
       on any of them (e.g., W at A1).
       - White plays at A1. The black group loses one liberty.
       - Black's best reply is often to play on the key internal point (B2) to try and form an eye.
       - Even if Black plays at B2, the potential eye is a "false eye." White can continue to
         play on the remaining external liberties (B1, A3, A4).
       - White can systematically remove all external liberties. For example:
         W@A1 -> B@B2 -> W@B1 -> B@A3 -> W@A4. This last move at A4 leaves the black
         group with no liberties, capturing it.
       - If Black tries to play on an external liberty instead of B2, White can capture
         even more quickly by taking the other external points, eventually forcing black
         into atari and capturing with a final move at B2.

    Conclusion:
    Playing on any of the four external liberties (A1, B1, A3, A4) initiates a
    sequence that White can always win, leading to the capture of the black group.
    Therefore, all four of these moves are correct.
