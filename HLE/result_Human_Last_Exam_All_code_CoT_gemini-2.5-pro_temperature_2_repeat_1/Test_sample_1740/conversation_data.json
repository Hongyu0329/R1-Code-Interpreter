    "My plan is to determine the number of human let-7 family members by consulting established biological databases and literature. The let-7 family is a group of related microRNAs, but the term \"member\" can be interpreted in two ways: as the number of unique mature miRNA sequences or as the number of distinct genes that produce them. Since some members (like let-7a) are encoded by multiple genes, counting the genes gives a more comprehensive picture of the family's representation in the genome. I will identify the different let-7 subtypes (let-7a, let-7b, etc.) and count how many distinct gene loci are associated with each. Then, I will write a Python script that stores these counts, calculates the total sum, and prints the detailed breakdown as a final equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_human_let7_family_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of human let-7 family members,\n    based on the number of distinct gene loci.\n\n    The let-7 family includes several microRNAs, and some, like let-7a,\n    are encoded by multiple distinct genes (paralogs). This function sums\n    the gene counts for each family member to provide a total. miR-98 is\n    included as it is widely considered a functional member of the let-7 family.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary mapping each let-7 family member to the number of its\n    # corresponding gene loci identified in the human genome.\n    let7_gene_loci = {\n        \"let-7a\": 3,\n        \"let-7b\": 1,\n        \"let-7c\": 1,\n        \"let-7d\": 1,\n        \"let-7e\": 1,\n        \"let-7f\": 2,\n        \"let-7g\": 1,\n        \"let-7i\": 1,\n        \"miR-98\": 1,\n    }\n\n    # Calculate the total number of members by summing the gene counts\n    total_members = sum(let7_gene_loci.values())\n\n    # Build the detailed equation string for clarity\n    equation_parts = []\n    for member, count in let7_gene_loci.items():\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{count} ({member})\")\n    \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"To date, the number of identified human let-7 family members (by gene loci) is calculated as follows:\")\n    # Print the full equation showing how the total is derived\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_members}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_human_let7_family_members()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
