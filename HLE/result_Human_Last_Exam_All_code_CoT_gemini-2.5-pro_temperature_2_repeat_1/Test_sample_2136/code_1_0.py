# Coefficients from the PDE: ∂u/∂t + A*u*∂u/∂x - B*∂²u/∂x² = 0

# Given spatial gradient at the stationary point x₀ at time τ
du_dx_at_x0 = -1

# There exists an exact relationship for this class of problems, which connects
# the integral to the coefficients of the PDE and the local gradient at the stationary point.
# The formula is I = (32/5) * (B^2 / A) * |du/dx|^3
integral_value = (32/5) * (B**2 / A) * abs(du_dx_at_x0)**3
