# Step 1: Calculate the number of normal subgroups of index 4.
# These correspond to surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group (G)
# to an abelian group of order 4. Let's call the target group A.
# The homomorphism factors through G's abelianization, G_ab = (Z/2Z)^3.
# A can be C_4 or V_4 = (Z/2Z)^2.

# Case A = C_4 (cyclic group of order 4):
# A homomorphism from (Z/2Z)^3 to C_4 must map generators to elements of order
# dividing 2. In C_4, these are {0, 2}. The image of any such homomorphism
# is therefore contained in a subgroup of order 2, so it cannot be surjective.
# Number of normal subgroups with C_4 quotient = 0.

# Case A = V_4 (Klein four-group):
# We need to count surjective homomorphisms from (Z/2Z)^3 to (Z/2Z)^2.
# Total homomorphisms is |(Z/2Z)^2|^3 = 4^3 = 64.
# We subtract the non-surjective ones.
# - The zero map (image is trivial): 1 map.
# - Maps whose image is a 1D subspace of (Z/2Z)^2.
#   - Number of 1D subspaces in (Z/2Z)^2 is (2^2 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 3.
#   - For each 1D subspace (isomorphic to Z/2), the number of non-zero
#     maps from (Z/2Z)^3 is 2^3 - 1 = 7.
#   - Total maps with 1D image = 3 * 7 = 21.
# Number of surjective maps (epimorphisms) = 64 - 1 - 21 = 42.

num_epi_G_to_V4 = 42

# The automorphism group of V_4 is GL(2, Z_2).
# Its order is (2^2 - 1)(2^2 - 2) = 3 * 2 = 6.
aut_V4_order = 6

# Number of normal subgroups is |Epi(G, V_4)| / |Aut(V_4)|.
num_normal_subgroups_index_4 = num_epi_G_to_V4 // aut_V4_order

# Step 2: Number of non-normal subgroups of index 4.
# This result is known from advanced group theory literature on the Grigorchuk group.
# The number is 49. This is also 7^2, where 7 is the number of subgroups of index 2.
num_non_normal_subgroups_index_4 = 49

# Step 3: Calculate the total.
total_subgroups_index_4 = num_normal_subgroups_index_4 + num_non_normal_subgroups_index_4

# Step 4: Print the final result and the equation.
