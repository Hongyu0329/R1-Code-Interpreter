# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the first virtual call `a->foo()`.
#    The compiler knows the dynamic type of `a` is `A`, so it can devirtualize the call.
#    Number of vtable loads is 0.
#
# 2. Analyze the second virtual call `a->foo()`.
#    `escape(a)` makes the dynamic type of `a` unknown to the compiler.
#    A real virtual dispatch is necessary, which requires one vtable load.
#    Number of vtable loads is 1.
#
# 3. Analyze the third virtual call `b->foo()`.
#    The placement `new(a) B` makes the dynamic type of `b` known as `B`.
#    The compiler can devirtualize the call.
#    Number of vtable loads is 0.
#
# 4. Sum the loads to find the total.

# Number of vtable loads for the first call
loads_call_1 = 0
print(f"Loads for the first call (a->foo()): {loads_call_1}")

# Number of vtable loads for the second call
loads_call_2 = 1
print(f"Loads for the second call (a->foo() after escape): {loads_call_2}")

# Number of vtable loads for the third call
loads_call_3 = 0
print(f"Loads for the third call (b->foo()): {loads_call_3}")

# Calculate the total
total_loads = loads_call_1 + loads_call_2 + loads_call_3

print(f"\nTotal vtable loads = {loads_call_1} + {loads_call_2} + {loads_call_3} = {total_loads}")
