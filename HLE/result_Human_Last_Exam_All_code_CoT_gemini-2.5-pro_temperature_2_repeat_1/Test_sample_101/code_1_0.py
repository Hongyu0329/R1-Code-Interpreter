    1.  The question asks where concrete, actionable feedback has the greatest *long-term* developmental impact, according to Hidi and Renninger's model.

    2.  A student with 'Emerging Individual Interest' (Phase 3) is at a pivotal point. They are moving from needing external support to generating their own interest.

    3.  At this stage, they have enough foundational interest to value the feedback but are still building the skills and confidence to proceed independently.

    4.  Concrete feedback on 'immediate next steps' provides a perfect bridge. It helps them overcome challenges, builds their sense of competence, and solidifies their connection to the subject, thereby facilitating the crucial transition to a stable, 'Well-Developed Individual Interest' (Phase 4).

    5.  For students in other phases, the impact is less transformative. For those in Phase 1 or 2, the interest may be too dependent on external factors for the feedback to foster long-term change. For those in Phase 4, the interest is already self-sustaining.

    6.  Therefore, the feedback has its most significant long-term impact on the student with an emerging individual interest.
