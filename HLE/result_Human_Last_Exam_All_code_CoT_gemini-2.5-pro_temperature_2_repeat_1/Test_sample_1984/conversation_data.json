    "To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, for the given differential equation.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the function:** The differential equation is $x'(t) = f(x(t))$, where $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$.\n\n2.  **Find equilibrium points:** Equilibrium points exist where $x'(t) = 0$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\n    $$\n    -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n    $$\n    Factor out a $-x$ from the expression:\n    $$\n    -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n    $$\n    The term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n    $$\n    -x(x-1)^2 = 0\n    $$\n    The solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points: $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the stability of each equilibrium point:** We can determine stability by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at each equilibrium point. An equilibrium point $x_0$ is stable if $f'(x_0) < 0$.\n\n    First, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n    $$\n    f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n    $$\n    Now, we test each point:\n    *   **For $x = 0$**:\n        $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n        Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n    *   **For $x = 1$**:\n        $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n        Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around $x=1$. Since $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative, the sign of $f(x)$ near $x=1$ is determined by the sign of $-x$, which is negative.\n        - For $x > 1$, $f(x) < 0$, so the solution moves towards $x=1$.\n        - For $x < 1$ (but close to 1), $f(x) < 0$, so the solution moves away from $x=1$.\n        Since solutions starting on one side of $x=1$ move away from it, the point is not stable (it is semi-stable).\n\n4.  **Count the number of stable equilibria:** Based on the analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. Therefore, $m=1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final expression:** We need to calculate $m - 2^{4048}$. With $m=1$, this becomes $1 - 2^{4048}$. The following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\n# The number of stable equilibrium points, m, is 1.\nm = 1\n\n# The exponent in the expression.\nexponent = 4048\n\n# The base of the exponent.\nbase = 2\n\n# Calculate the value of 2^4048.\n# Python can handle arbitrarily large integers.\nlarge_number = base**exponent\n\n# Calculate the final result of m - 2^4048.\nresult = m - large_number\n\n# Output the equation with the found values.\n# The numbers in the final equation are m=1, base=2, exponent=4048.\nprint(f\"The equation to solve is: {m} - {base}^{exponent}\")\nprint(\"The final result is:\")\nprint(result)\n\n```\n<<<...-1>>>"
