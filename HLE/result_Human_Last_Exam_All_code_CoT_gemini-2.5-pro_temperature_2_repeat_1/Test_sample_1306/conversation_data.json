    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the mathematical object**: The question concerns the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. The key parameter is that $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. In the language of representation theory, this means we are in the \"root of unity\" case with $l=3$.\n\n2.  **Characterize the representations**: Unlike the case where $q$ is not a root of unity (where every indecomposable representation is irreducible), the root of unity case is much more complex. The category is no longer semisimple, and it contains infinitely many distinct indecomposable objects. This is a standard result in the field; the category is of \"infinite representation type.\"\n\n3.  **Count the irreducible objects**: The irreducible (or simple) objects in this category are well-classified. For a primitive $l$-th root of unity, there are exactly $l$ non-isomorphic irreducible representations. In our case, $l=3$, so there are **3** irreducible objects.\n\n4.  **Count the total indecomposable objects**: As established in step 2, the category $C$ is of infinite representation type. This means there is an **infinite** number of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects. For example, there are infinite families of indecomposable modules of dimension $l=3$ that are parameterized by a continuous variable from the base field $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the percentage**: The percentage is calculated as:\n    (Number of Irreducible Objects / Total Number of Indecomposable Objects) * 100\n\n    Plugging in our findings, the calculation is (3 / ∞) * 100. Any finite number divided by infinity is 0.\n\n6.  **Formulate the code**: The python script will print this reasoning, stating the number of irreducible objects, explaining why the total number of indecomposable objects is infinite, and then presenting the final calculation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_irreducible_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of irreducible objects in the category C for\n    the quantum group u_q(sl_2) where q is a primitive third root of unity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In the representation theory of quantum groups, when q is a primitive l-th root of unity,\n    # the structure of the category of representations changes dramatically from the classical case.\n    # Here, l=3.\n\n    # Step 1: Count the number of irreducible (simple) representations.\n    # For a primitive l-th root of unity, there are 'l' distinct irreducible representations.\n    num_irreducible = 3\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the total number of indecomposable representations.\n    # The category of representations is of \"infinite representation type\", meaning\n    # there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable objects.\n    # We can represent this concept using infinity.\n    total_indecomposable = math.inf\n    total_indecomposable_symbol = \"∞\"\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the percentage of irreducible objects in the specified category C.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Step 1: The number of irreducible objects in C.\")\n    print(f\"For q a primitive 3rd root of unity, there are exactly {num_irreducible} non-isomorphic irreducible representations.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The total number of indecomposable objects in C.\")\n    print(\"The category C is of 'infinite representation type', which means it contains an infinite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects.\")\n    print(f\"Total number of indecomposable objects = {total_indecomposable_symbol}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: The final percentage calculation.\")\n    print(\"Percentage = (Number of Irreducible Objects / Total Number of Indecomposable Objects) * 100\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n\n    # Printing each \"number\" in the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"Percentage = ({num_irreducible} / {total_indecomposable_symbol}) * 100\")\n\n    # A finite number divided by infinity is 0.\n    result_percentage = 0.0\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis evaluates to {result_percentage}%.\")\n\ncalculate_irreducible_percentage()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
