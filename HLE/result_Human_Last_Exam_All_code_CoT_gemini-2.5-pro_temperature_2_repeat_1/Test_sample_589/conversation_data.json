    "My plan is to first identify the movie that matches the specific scene described. The key elements are a teenager, a pink bike, and a confrontation with an oncoming car. Based on these details, I've determined the movie is the 1985 horror sequel \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge.\" In the film, the teenage protagonist Jesse Walsh rides a pink bike and pedals toward his menacing gym teacher's approaching car.\n\nTo fulfill the prompt's requirement of providing a Python script and incorporating an \"equation\" for any numbers involved, I will write a script that constructs and prints the movie title. The number '2' in the title will be represented by a simple addition equation.\n\n```python\n# Movie Identification Script\n\n# The movie in question is \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\".\n# We will construct the title and present it as the answer.\n\n# Define the parts of the movie title.\ntitle_part_1 = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"\ntitle_number = 2\ntitle_part_2 = \": Freddy's Revenge\"\n\n# As per the instructions, an equation involving the number in the title is required.\n# We will create a simple equation for the number 2.\nfirst_number_in_equation = 1\nsecond_number_in_equation = 1\nresult = first_number_in_equation + second_number_in_equation\n\n# Combine the parts into the full movie title string.\nfull_movie_title = f\"{title_part_1} {title_number}{title_part_2}\"\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"The movie where a teenager rides a pink bike toward an oncoming car is: {full_movie_title}\")\n\n# Print the equation as requested, showing each number.\nprint(\"\\nEquation for the number in the title:\")\nprint(f\"{first_number_in_equation} + {second_number_in_equation} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
