# Movie Identification Script

# The movie in question is "A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge".
# We will construct the title and present it as the answer.

# Define the parts of the movie title.
title_part_1 = "A Nightmare on Elm Street"
title_number = 2
title_part_2 = ": Freddy's Revenge"

# As per the instructions, an equation involving the number in the title is required.
# We will create a simple equation for the number 2.
first_number_in_equation = 1
second_number_in_equation = 1
result = first_number_in_equation + second_number_in_equation

# Combine the parts into the full movie title string.
full_movie_title = f"{title_part_1} {title_number}{title_part_2}"

# Print the final answer.
print(f"The movie where a teenager rides a pink bike toward an oncoming car is: {full_movie_title}")

# Print the equation as requested, showing each number.
print("\nEquation for the number in the title:")
print(f"{first_number_in_equation} + {second_number_in_equation} = {result}")
