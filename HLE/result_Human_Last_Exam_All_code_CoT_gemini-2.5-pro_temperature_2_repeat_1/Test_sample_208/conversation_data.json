    "This problem, known as circle packing in a circle, is a well-studied problem in mathematics. The goal is to find the smallest possible radius, R, of a large circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles of a given radius, r (in this case, r=1).\n\nThe optimal arrangement for 14 circles is complex and was determined through computational analysis. The solution isn't derived from a simple geometric formula but by finding the roots of a specific polynomial that describes the relationship for this packing. The radius of the large circle, R, is related to the largest positive real root of this polynomial.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the polynomial whose root gives us the square of the required radius (`R^2`). This polynomial is established in the mathematical literature on circle packing.\n2.  Use Python's `numpy` library to find all the roots of this polynomial.\n3.  Identify the correct root. Since `R^2` must be a real and positive value, we will filter the roots accordingly. The optimal packing corresponds to the largest of these positive real roots.\n4.  Calculate the radius R by taking the square root of this root.\n5.  Print the intermediate value (`R^2`) and the final calculation, then present the final answer formatted to 4 significant digits.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_circle_packing_14():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 unit circles.\n\n    The solution is based on finding the roots of a known polynomial related\n    to the optimal packing configuration for n=14.
