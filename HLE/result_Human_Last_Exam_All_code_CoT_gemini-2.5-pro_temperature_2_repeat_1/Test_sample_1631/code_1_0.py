    # Explanation of the engineering principle:
    # In sheet metal forming, success depends on controlling how the flat metal sheet
    # flows into the three-dimensional die cavity.
    # - Too much material flowing into a region causes compressive stresses, leading to wrinkles (Option A).
    # - Too little material flowing into a region (i.e., too much restriction) causes high tensile stresses,
    #   leading to excessive thinning and tearing/splitting (Option I).
    #
    # "Positive and negative bypass notches" are features designed specifically to manage this flow.
    # A positive notch can act as a restrainer (a small-scale drawbead), slowing down material flow.
    # A negative notch (a cutout) can relieve stress and provide more material locally, enabling easier flow.
    # This control over material inflow is especially critical around complex geometries (e.g., small radii, sharp corners)
    # where the material demand is not uniform.
    #
    # Option D provides the most fundamental and encompassing reason. It describes the core mechanism
    # (controlling material inflow) that engineers manipulate to prevent the resulting defects mentioned
    # in other options like A and I.
