    "My plan is to first identify the physicist and the specific optical effect based on the clues provided in your question. The key detail is the story involving the accidental observation by a custodial worker, which is a well-known anecdote in the history of science.\n\nOnce the physicist is identified, I will write a simple Python script. The script will store the name of the physicist in a variable and then use the `print()` function to display the name, fulfilling the requirement to provide the answer via a code block.\n\n```python\ndef solve_physics_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the physicist\n    who discovered phase contrast microscopy.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The clues point to the Dutch physicist Frits Zernike.\n    # - He worked in microscopy.\n    # - He discovered phase contrast, an optical effect that makes transparent objects visible.\n    # - The discovery was famously inspired by observing a janitor cleaning a diffraction grating (a type of concave mirror),\n    #   which made the normally invisible grooves on the grating visible.\n    \n    physicist_name = \"Frits Zernike\"\n    \n    print(physicist_name)\n\nsolve_physics_riddle()\n```\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
