def solve_max_ghtw():
    """
    Calculates the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (ghtw) for a hypergraph
    with a given number of hyperedges.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Upper Bound: For any hypergraph with N hyperedges, a trivial
       tree decomposition with a single bag containing all N hyperedges has a
       width of N - 1. Thus, ghtw <= N - 1.

    2. Lower Bound: We can construct a "worst-case" hypergraph with N
       hyperedges {e1, ..., eN} by including a common vertex 'v' in every
       hyperedge. For any valid tree decomposition of this hypergraph, there
       must be a bag that contains all hyperedges incident to 'v', which is the
       entire set {e1, ..., eN}. This forces the maximum bag size to be at least
       N, and therefore the width to be at least N - 1.

    3. Conclusion: Since ghtw <= N - 1 for all hypergraphs and ghtw >= N - 1
       for a specific case, the maximum possible ghtw is N - 1.
