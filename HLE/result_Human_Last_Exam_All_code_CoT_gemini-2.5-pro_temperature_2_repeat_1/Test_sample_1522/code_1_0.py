    """
    Analyzes the mathematical properties of a function f based on the given
    conditions and determines the smallest possible number of its fixed points.

    A fixed point of f is a real number x such that f(x) = x.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the given condition on the function f.
    # The problem states that there is a single constant 'a' satisfying two properties:
    #  (1) a <= 1
    #  (2) For all distinct x, y in R, |f(x) - f(y)| < a * |x - y|
    #
    # From property (2), we can divide by |x - y| (which is non-zero):
    #  |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y| < a
    # This inequality holds for ALL distinct x and y. This means 'a' is a strict
    # upper bound for the set of all possible ratios |f(x)-f(y)|/|x-y|.
    #
    # The supremum (least upper bound) of these ratios is known as the
    # Lipschitz constant of f, denoted by K. So, K <= a.
    # The problem can be summarized by the following chain of inequalities:
    #   K <= a  AND  a <= 1
    # Furthermore, since the inequality |f(x)-f(y)| < a|x-y| is strict for all x, y,
    # the supremum K must be strictly less than 'a' if the supremum is attained, or K <= a.
    # Let's consider the full statement: exists a in (-inf, 1] s.t. K < a.
    # This implies that K must be strictly less than 1.
    # For instance, if K were 1, you could not find any a <= 1 such that K < a.
    # Therefore, the condition is equivalent to stating that the Lipschitz constant K < 1.

    # Step 2: Identify the type of function.
    # A continuous function on a metric space with a Lipschitz constant K < 1
    # is known as a "contraction mapping".
    
    # Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.
    # This theorem states that a contraction mapping on a non-empty complete
    # metric space always has exactly one fixed point.
    # The set of real numbers R, with the standard distance metric d(x,y)=|x-y|,
    # is a non-empty complete metric space.
    #
    # The theorem guarantees both the EXISTENCE and UNIQUENESS of a fixed point.
    #   - Uniqueness proof sketch: Assume two distinct fixed points x1, x2.
    #     Then f(x1)=x1 and f(x2)=x2. The condition gives |x1-x2|=|f(x1)-f(x2)| <= K|x1-x2|.
    #     Since |x1-x2|>0, we can divide to get 1 <= K, which contradicts K < 1.
    #     So there can be at most one fixed point.
    #   - Existence proof sketch: Define g(x) = f(x) - x. g is continuous.
    #     It can be shown that g(x) -> +inf as x -> -inf, and g(x) -> -inf as x -> +inf.
    #     By the Intermediate Value Theorem, g(x) must equal zero for some x.
    #     This value of x is a fixed point.

    # Step 4: Conclude the result.
    # For any function f that satisfies the given conditions, the number of fixed points
    # is not just "at least" or "at most" one; it is *exactly* one.
    
    number_of_fixed_points = 1
    
    # Final Output
    print("The given conditions imply that the function f is a contraction mapping on the real numbers.")
    print("The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees that such a function has exactly one fixed point.")
    print("Therefore, the number of fixed points is always 1.")
    print(f"\nThe smallest possible number of fixed points for f is {number_of_fixed_points}.")
