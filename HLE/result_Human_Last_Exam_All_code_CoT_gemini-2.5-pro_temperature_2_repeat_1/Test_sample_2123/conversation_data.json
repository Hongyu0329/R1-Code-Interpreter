    "This is a fascinating literary riddle that requires connecting Russian literature, geography, and English poetry through a linguistic pun. My plan is to identify the source of the riddle and then use a Python script to lay out the logical steps of the pun.\n\nThe plan involves these steps:\n1.  **Identify the Source:** The riddle refers to a famous essay by the Russian formalist writer Viktor Shklovsky, titled \"Zoo, or Letters Not about Love.\"\n2.  **Identify the Metaphor:** In the essay, Shklovsky describes the grand, sweeping boulevards of Vienna. To express their shape and impressiveness, he compares them to the backside of an Amazon.\n3.  **Identify the Pun:** The common Russian word for \"backside\" is \"попа\" (pronounced 'popa').\n4.  **Connect to the Poet:** This Russian word sounds nearly identical to the surname of the famous 18th-century English poet, Alexander Pope.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this connection.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the literary riddle by breaking down the pun.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The key to the riddle is a metaphorical description in a Russian essay.\n    source_essay = \"Zoo, or Letters Not about Love\"\n    author = \"Viktor Shklovsky\"\n    location = \"Vienna\"\n\n    # In the essay, the boulevards of Vienna are compared to an Amazon's backside.\n    # The Russian word for \"backside\" is the core of the pun.\n    key_russian_word = \"попа\"\n    phonetic_pronunciation = \"popa\"\n\n    # This sound directly corresponds to the surname of a famous English poet.\n    english_poet_surname = \"Pope\"\n\n    # Print the explanation step-by-step.\n    print(\"The riddle's solution is based on a literary reference and a linguistic pun:\")\n    print(f\"1. The essay is '{source_essay}' by {author}.\")\n    print(f\"2. When describing the wide boulevards of {location}, the author uses a specific metaphor.\")\n    print(f\"3. The Russian word at the heart of the metaphor is '{key_russian_word}', pronounced roughly as '{phonetic_pronunciation}'.\")\n    print(f\"4. This sound is phonetically similar to the surname of the English poet, Alexander {english_poet_surname}.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the surname is:\")\n    print(english_poet_surname)\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution.\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Pope>>>"
