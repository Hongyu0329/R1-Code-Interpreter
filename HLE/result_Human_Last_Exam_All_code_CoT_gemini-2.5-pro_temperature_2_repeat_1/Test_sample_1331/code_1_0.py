    This mutation disrupts the formation of the 2-3 anti-terminator loop. The anti-terminator is essential for transcription to continue when tryptophan is low. By preventing its formation, region 3 is always available to pair with region 4. Under high tryptophan, the ribosome would already block region 2, but this mutation ensures that even under low tryptophan, the anti-terminator cannot form. This would lead to termination in both low and high tryptophan conditions.

    The terminator structure has two parts: the 3-4 stem-loop and the following U-rich sequence. The stem-loop causes the polymerase to pause, and the weak A-U bonds between the U-rich sequence and the DNA template allow the transcript to dissociate. Changing the U-rich sequence to G-C rich would create strong G-C bonds. Even if the 3-4 loop forms and the polymerase pauses, the transcript would not be released. This directly prevents termination. Although the 3-4 loop itself still forms, its function is abolished, fulfilling the primary goal of the question (continued transcription).

    "Overexpression" is vague. If it means more efficient translation initiation, it would not change the fundamental logic.
