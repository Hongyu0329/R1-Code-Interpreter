    # The problem asks for the minimum size of the union of n=2024 sets,
    # where each set has k=45 elements, and any two sets have an intersection of size 1.
    #
    # A construction that achieves this is the "sunflower" model.
    # In this model, all sets share one common element.
    # The other k-1 elements in each set are unique to that set.
    # The total number of elements in the union is the single common element
    # plus the n groups of (k-1) unique elements.
    # The formula is: Union Size = 1 + n * (k - 1)
    #
    # A key result from combinatorial design theory shows that when n > (k-1)^2,
    # as is the case here (2024 > 44^2 = 1936), this sunflower construction
    # indeed gives the minimum possible size for the union.
