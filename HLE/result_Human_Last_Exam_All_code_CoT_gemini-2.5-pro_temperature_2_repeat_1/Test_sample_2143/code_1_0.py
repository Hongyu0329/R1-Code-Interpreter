# Plan:
# 1. The request asks for the full name of "HE" based on an interpretation by Veronika Campan.
# 2. The clues provided are "another's material possessions" and "prohibition against representation," which refer to the Ten Commandments.
# 3. Veronika Campan is a Lacanian psychoanalyst. Lacanian psychoanalysis is a re-interpretation of the work of a foundational figure.
# 4. That foundational figure, who wrote a famous and controversial book on Moses and the commandments late in his life, is Sigmund Freud.
# 5. The script will store his first and last name and then print the full name.

first_name = "Sigmund"
last_name = "Freud"

# Combine and print the full name.
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
