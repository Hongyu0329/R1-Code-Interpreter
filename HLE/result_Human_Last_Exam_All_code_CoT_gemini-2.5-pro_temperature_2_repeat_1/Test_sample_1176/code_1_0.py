    This function stores and prints the solution to the geology classification task.

    The task is to classify 10 statements about North American Cordilleran geology
    as either Consensus (C) or Debated (D).

    The classifications are as follows:
    1: C (Morrison formation as a foredeep deposit)
    2: D (Cause of metamorphic core complexes)
    3: C (Existence of the Nevadaplano)
    4: D (Cause of the Arizonaplano)
    5: C (Relative position of Laramide and Sevier structures)
    6: C (Origin of the Sierra Nevada and Idaho batholiths)
    7: C (Southwestward propagation of ignimbrite volcanism)
    8: D (Uplift history of the Colorado Plateau)
    9: D (Uplift history of the Cascades arc)
    10: D (Specific cause of the Laramide orogeny)

    The final answer is a continuous string of these classifications.
