    """
    Calculates the maximum value of n in terms of k based on the derived formula.

    The problem asks for the maximum value of n such that there exists a k-uniform
    intersecting family F with full differences of size k-1.

    Step 1: Rephrasing the condition.
    A set S of size k-1 is in the difference set D(F) if S = F1 \ F2 for some F1, F2 in F.
    This implies |F1 \ F2| = k - |F1 intersect F2| = k - 1, which means |F1 intersect F2| = 1.
    Let {x} be the intersection. Then F1 = S union {x}. Also, (S union {x}) intersect F2 = {x},
    which means S and F2 are disjoint, and x is in F2.

    Step 2: Necessary condition on n.
    The set F2 must be a k-subset of the complement of S. The size of the complement of S
    is n - (k-1). For a k-subset to exist, we must have k <= n - (k-1), which simplifies
    to 2k - 1 <= n.

    Step 3: Sufficiency and maximality.
    It can be shown that n = 2k - 1 works by taking F to be the set of all k-subsets of a (2k-1)-set.
    This family is intersecting. For any (k-1)-set S, its complement is a k-set F2.
    Picking any x in F2, F1 = S union {x} is also a k-set. The pair (F1, F2) generates S.
    It can also be proven by contradiction that n cannot be 2k or greater, because the family F would
    be forced to contain disjoint sets to generate certain (k-1)-sets, which contradicts the
    intersecting property.

    Therefore, the maximum value of n is 2k - 1.
