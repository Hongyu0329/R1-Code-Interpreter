    "The user wants to find the gain matrix `L` for a deadbeat observer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. This requires finding an observer gain matrix `L` such that the observation error dynamics `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)` converge to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is achieved by making the matrix `A - LC` nilpotent, which means placing all its eigenvalues at the origin (0).\n\n2.  **Observability Check**: First, we must verify that the system is observable. A deadbeat observer that can drive the error to zero from any initial state can only be designed if the system is observable. We will check this by computing the rank of the observability matrix `O = [C; CA; ...; CA^(n-1)]`, where `n` is the number of states. If the rank of `O` is equal to `n`, the system is observable. For this problem, `n=4`.\n\n3.  **Pole Placement Formulation**: Designing the observer gain `L` to place the poles of `A - LC` is known as a pole placement problem. This problem is \"dual\" to the more common state-feedback control problem. We can find `L` by solving the pole placement problem for the dual system, which is defined by matrices `A^T` (as the state matrix) and `C^T` (as the input matrix). We want to find a gain `K` for this dual system such that `A^T - C^T K` has all eigenvalues at zero. The desired observer gain `L` will then be `K^T`.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: We will use Python with the `numpy` and `scipy` libraries.\n    *   Define the system matrices `A` and `C`.\n    *   The desired eigenvalues (poles) for a deadbeat observer are all at `0`. However, placing multiple poles at the exact same location can be numerically challenging for standard algorithms, especially for multi-output systems. To overcome this, we can place the poles at slightly different locations near zero (e.g., `-1e-6, -2e-6, ...`). The resulting gain matrix will be a very close approximation of the ideal deadbeat gain.\n    *   We will use the function `scipy.signal.place_poles` on the dual system (`A.T`, `C.T`) to find the gain `K`.\n    *   The final observer gain is `L = K^T`.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: The script will calculate and print the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.signal import place_poles\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function designs a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices from the problem description\n    A = np.array([[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n                  [1, 0, 0, 2],\n                  [0, 1, 0, -1],\n                  [-1, 0, 1, -1]])\n    C = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\n    # Get the number of states, n\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Check system observability ---\n    # Construct the observability matrix O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]\n    O_list = [C]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        O_list.append(O_list[-1] @ A)\n    O = np.vstack(O_list)\n    rank_O = np.linalg.matrix_rank(O)\n\n    if rank_O < n:\n        print(f\"The system is not observable (Rank of observability matrix is {rank_O}).\")\n        print(\"A deadbeat observer that drives the error to zero for any initial state cannot be designed.\")\n        return\n\n    # --- Step 2: Design the deadbeat observer using pole placement ---\n    # We need to find L such that all eigenvalues of (A - LC) are zero.\n    # This is equivalent to finding K for the dual system (A.T, C.T) such that\n    # eigenvalues of (A.T - C.T * K) are zero.
