# General solution
# The general solution to the differential equation is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9
# We can write this as y**2 - C*x**2 - C**2 - C - 9 = 0

# To present the components of the solution y^2 = C*x^2 + C**2 + C + 9:
term_y_sq = y**2
term_Cx_sq = C * x**2
term_C_sq = C**2
term_C = C
constant_term = 9

# We express the equation as y^2 = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4
