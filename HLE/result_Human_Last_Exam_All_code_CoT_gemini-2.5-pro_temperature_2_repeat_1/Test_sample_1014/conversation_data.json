    "My plan is to find the largest prime divisor of 8,139,881 by first determining all of its prime factors.\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization Function:** I will create a Python function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its prime factors.\n2.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   First, the function will handle the case of the smallest prime, 2, by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 and adding 2 to the list of factors.\n    *   Then, it will iterate through odd numbers (`i`) starting from 3 up to the square root of the remaining `n`. For each `i` that divides `n`, it will be added to the factors list, and `n` will be divided by `i`. This is repeated until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`.\n    *   After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 2, the remaining value of `n` is a prime factor itself. This correctly handles cases where the number is prime (like 8,139,881) or has a prime factor larger than its square root.\n3.  **Output:**\n    *   After obtaining the list of prime factors, I will construct and print the prime factorization equation, for example `8139881 = 8139881`. This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    *   Finally, I will find the maximum value from the list of factors and print it as the largest prime divisor.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime factors of a given number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Handle the factor 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n        \n    # Handle odd factors\n    # Iterate from 3 up to the square root of the remaining n\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n            \n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2, it is the last factor\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(int(n))\n        \n    return factors\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to find and print the largest prime divisor of 8139881.\n    \"\"\"\n    number = 8139881\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(number)\n    \n    if not factors:\n        print(f\"The number {number} has no prime factors (or is 1).\")\n        return\n\n    # Fulfill the requirement to output the equation\n    equation = f\"{number} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n    print(\"The prime factorization is:\")\n    print(equation)\n\n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {number} is:\")\n    print(largest_prime)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
