# --- Plan Execution ---

# 1. Set up high-precision calculation environment
# The number 7^13 has 11 digits. The result of the log calculation will
# also have a large integer part. To get the fractional part accurately,
# we need to set a high precision. 50 digits is more than sufficient.
decimal.getcontext().prec = 50

# 2. Define the expression N = e^(-7^13)
# We calculate its base-10 logarithm, L = log10(N).
# L = -7^13 * log10(e)

# 3. Calculate the terms for L
val_7_13 = decimal.Decimal(7) ** 13
# log10(e) can be computed as 1 / ln(10)
log10_e = decimal.Decimal(1) / decimal.Decimal(10).ln()
L = -val_7_13 * log10_e

# 4. Decompose N into its significand and exponent
# N = A * 10^k, where k is the integer part of L and A is from the fractional part.
# k = floor(L)
# log10(A) = {L} = L - floor(L)
# A = 10^{L - floor(L)}
k = L.to_integral_value(rounding=decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)
A = decimal.Decimal(10) ** (L - k)

# 5. Find the first two non-zero digits from the significand A
# Convert A to a string to iterate through its digits.
# We format it with enough precision to avoid rounding errors on the first few digits.
s = "{:.40f}".format(A)

# Collect all non-zero digits
nonzero_digits = []
for char in s:
    if char.isdigit() and char != '0':
        nonzero_digits.append(char)

d1 = nonzero_digits[0]
d2 = nonzero_digits[1]

# --- Output the results ---
print("The number we are analyzing is N = e^(-7^13).")

print(f"The exponent is k = floor(log10(N)) = floor(-7^13 * log10(e)).")

print(f"log10(e) ≈ {log10_e}")
print(f"log10(N) ≈ {L}")
print(f"So, k = {k}")

print("\nStep 2: Calculate the significand A.")
print(f"The significand is A = 10^(log10(N) - k).")
print(f"A ≈ {A}")

print("\nStep 3: Find the first two non-zero digits from A.")
print(f"The first non-zero digit is the first digit of A, which is {d1}.")
print(f"The second non-zero digit is the next digit of A, which is {d2}.")

print(f"\nThus, the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13) are {d1} and {d2}.")
