    "My plan is to determine the answer by comparing the frequency of a human muscle twitch with the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Frequency:** A human muscle twitch, or myogenic sound, produces very low-frequency vibrations, typically in the range of 10-50 Hz. I will use a representative frequency of **25 Hz** for the calculation.\n2.  **Gather Data:** I will research the approximate hearing ranges for each animal in the answer choices.\n3.  **Create a Program:** I will write a Python script that stores these hearing ranges. The script will then iterate through each animal and perform a check to see if 25 Hz falls within its hearing range.\n4.  **Display the Logic:** For each animal, the script will print the comparison in a clear format, showing the animal's minimum and maximum hearing frequency against the target frequency. This will satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation.\"\n5.  **Identify the Best Candidate:** The program will identify all animals that *could* hear the sound and then provide a final conclusion explaining why one candidate is the most likely.\n\n```python\ndef find_animal_with_super_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines which animal might be able to hear a human muscle twitch\n    by comparing the twitch's frequency to the hearing ranges of different animals.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
