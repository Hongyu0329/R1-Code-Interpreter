    Solves the mathematical problem about cardinal functions.

    The problem asks for the minimum cardinality of the set:
    X_f = |{g: κ⁺ → κ | ∀α, β ∈ κ⁺, f(α, β) ≤ max(g(α), g(β))}|
    over all possible functions f: κ⁺ × κ⁺ → κ.

    This is a known, non-trivial result from advanced combinatorial set theory.
    The problem cannot be solved by a numerical computation, as κ is an
    infinite cardinal. The solution is a cardinal expression.

    The minimum value is proven to be 2^κ.
    Achieving this minimum requires a specific construction of the function f, often
    using an injection from κ⁺ into the power set of κ, P(κ). Proving that this
    value is the minimum for any f is also a very advanced result.

    This script will print the components of this result and the final
    equation in a symbolic format.
