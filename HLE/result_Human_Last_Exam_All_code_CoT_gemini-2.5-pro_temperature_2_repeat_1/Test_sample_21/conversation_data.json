    "To find the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Apply Chebotarev's Density Theorem**: This theorem states that the desired density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ of the polynomial that are 7-cycles.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group $G$**: I'll start by computing the discriminant of the polynomial. If the discriminant is a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_7$. I will also verify the irreducibility of the polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ to ensure $G$ is a transitive group.\n3.  **Identify Candidate Groups**: Based on the properties from step 2, I will list the possible transitive subgroups of $A_7$ that could be the Galois group $G$.\n4.  **Refine the Group Choice**: I will factor the polynomial modulo a small, unramified prime. The structure of the factorization provides information about the cycle structure of elements in $G$, which will help eliminate some of the candidate groups.\n5.  **Calculate the Density**: For the remaining candidate groups, I will calculate the proportion of 7-cycles. The problem is set up such that this proportion is the same for all remaining possibilities, leading to a single answer for the density.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the necessary calculations for steps 2 and 4 and explain the final calculation based on the group theory analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nimport math\n\ndef solve_polynomial_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n    f = x**7 - 14*x**5 + 56*x**3 - 56*x + 22\n    \n    print(\"This script determines the natural density of primes p for which\")\n    print(\"f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 is irreducible mod p.\")\n    print(\"According to Chebotarev's Density Theorem, this density equals the proportion\")\n    print(\"of 7-cycles in the Galois group G of the polynomial.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the discriminant to determine if G is in A_7.\n    disc = sympy.discriminant(f, x)\n    if sympy.is_perfect_square(disc):\n        print(f\"The discriminant is {disc}, which is a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"This implies the Galois group G is a subgroup of the alternating group A_7.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The discriminant is not a perfect square.
