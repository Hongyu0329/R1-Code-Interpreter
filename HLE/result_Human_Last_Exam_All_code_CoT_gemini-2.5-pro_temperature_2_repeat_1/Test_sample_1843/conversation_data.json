    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $N$ and order $k$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$. For $N = 36036$, the factorization is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi = \\prod_{p^a || N} \\chi_{p^a}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character modulo the prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$.\n\n3.  **Order of Characters:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1^{a_1}}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_2^{a_2}}), \\dots)$. We are given that the desired order is 6.\n\n4.  **Counting Component Characters:** For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we need to count the number of available primitive characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ whose order divides 6.\n    *   For a modulus $p^a$ where the group of characters is cyclic (i.e., for $p$ odd, or for $p^a=2, 4$), the number of primitive characters whose order divides a number $D$ is given by the formula: $\\text{gcd}(\\phi(p^a), D) - \\text{gcd}(\\phi(p^{a-1}), D)$ (with $\\phi(p^0) = 1$).\n    We will apply this to each factor of $N=36036 = 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n5.  **Verifying the LCM Condition:** For the final character's order to be exactly 6, the lcm of the component orders must be 6. This requires that at least one component has an order divisible by 2, and at least one has an order divisible by 3.\n    *   For the factor $4=2^2$, any primitive character has order 2. This guarantees the lcm is divisible by 2.\n    *   For the factor $9=3^2$, any primitive character has order 3 or 6. This guarantees the lcm is divisible by 3.\n    Since the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. As all component orders must divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Therefore, the lcm is guaranteed to be exactly 6 for any combination of chosen component characters.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        while temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors[temp_n] = factors.get(temp_n, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Greatest common divisor.\"\"\"\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef count_primitive_chars_by_order_divisor(p, k, D):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo p^k\n    whose order divides D.
