    "Based on my research, the user's question is based on a false premise. The former President of Nigeria is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name. The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. There is no public record of Goodluck Jonathan ever identifying himself with the name Azikiwe.\n\nTherefore, I will write a Python script to clarify this misunderstanding. The script will state the correct name and explain that the event in question never occurred.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_and_event():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about when Goodluck Jonathan\n    publicly identified as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    correct_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    mistaken_name_part = \"Azikiwe\"\n    \n    print(f\"The full name of the former President of Nigeria is {correct_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The name '{mistaken_name_part}' is not part of his name.\")\n    print(\"This might be a confusion with Nnamdi Azikiwe, another prominent Nigerian political figure.\")\n    print(\"\\nConsequently, there is no year in which Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe' because that is not his name.\")\n\ncheck_name_and_event()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe, as \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
