    "The name \"Odobeccus\" is not actually Gaulish, but rather the Latinized form of a Frankish (a Germanic tribe) name. This name is primarily known from historical chronicles and, unlike more famous names like *Chlodovech* (which became *Clovis*), it did not evolve into a standard, commonly recognized name in modern French. French historical texts often refer to this individual simply as \"Odobeccus.\"\n\nHowever, we can find a French equivalent by looking at the component parts of the name. The first element, **Odo-**, is a common Germanic root meaning \"wealth\" or \"property.\" This same root did evolve into a well-known French name.\n\nThe Germanic root **Odo-** is the origin of the French name **Eudes**.\n\nFor example, the 9th-century king of West Francia, Odo, is known in French as *Eudes Ier*. Therefore, while the full name \"Odobeccus\" does not have a direct translation, its root element corresponds to the French name \"Eudes\".\n\n<<<Eudes>>>"
