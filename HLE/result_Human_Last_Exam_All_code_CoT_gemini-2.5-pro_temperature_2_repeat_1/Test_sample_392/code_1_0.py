    This function verifies and prints the best checkmating sequence for the given
    chess position.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Load the chess board from the FEN string.
    2.  Based on prior analysis, the shortest and most forcing mate is sequence C.
    3.  This script programmatically executes the moves from sequence C:
        1... Qg1+ (Queen sacrifice, check)
        2. Rxg1 (Forced capture by White)
        3... Nf2# (Knight delivers a smothered checkmate)
    4.  After verifying the sequence leads to a checkmate, it prints the full
        sequence in standard algebraic notation.
