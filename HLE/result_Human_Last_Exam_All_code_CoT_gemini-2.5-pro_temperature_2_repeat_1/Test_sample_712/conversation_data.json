    "To answer your question, I will write a Python script that prints the name of the bacterial genus known for producing a compound with triboluminescent properties.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the specific genus of bacterium based on scientific knowledge. The genus *Photobacterium* is known for its bioluminescent properties. The enzyme responsible, luciferase, when crystallized, has been shown to exhibit triboluminescence (emitting light when the crystals are crushed).\n2.  Create a Python script that stores this name in a variable.\n3.  Use a `print()` function to display the answer in a clear, full sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_bacterium_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the genus of a bacterium\n    that produces a chemical compound exhibiting triboluminescent properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus is Photobacterium. It produces the enzyme luciferase.\n    # Crystals of luciferase have been shown to be triboluminescent.\n    genus = \"Photobacterium\"\n    \n    print(f\"The genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties is: {genus}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer.\nfind_bacterium_genus()\n```\n<<<Photobacterium>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
