    Calculates the number of distinct paths in a space formed by a line
    segment intersecting a circle twice.

    A "distinct path" is interpreted as a path that does not reuse any of the three
    connections between the two intersection points (P and Q).

    The path must go from one end of the line segment (A) to the other (B),
    passing through P and Q. The variety of paths comes from the different ways
    to travel between P and Q.
