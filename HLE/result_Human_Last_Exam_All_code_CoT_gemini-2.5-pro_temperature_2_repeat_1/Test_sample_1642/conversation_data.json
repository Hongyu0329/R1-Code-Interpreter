    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Constraints:** The problem requires placing `m` white queens and `m` black queens on a 16x16 chessboard such that no queen attacks any other queen. This implies that all `2 * m` queens must be in non-attacking positions relative to each other, regardless of their color.\n2.  **Relate to the N-Queens Problem:** The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board. Let this maximum number be `K`. We then have the relation `K = 2 * m`.\n3.  **Determine the Maximum Queens:** For any `N x N` board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens you can place is `N`. This is because each queen must occupy a unique row and a unique column. For a 16x16 board, `N=16`, so the maximum number of non-attacking queens is 16.\n4.  **Formulate and Solve the Equation:** From the steps above, we have `2 * m = 16`. Solving this equation gives `m = 8`.\n5.  **Confirm the Solution:** The ability to place 16 non-attacking queens on a 16x16 board is a known result of the \"16-Queens Problem\". Since a solution exists, it is possible to place 16 queens, and we can simply designate 8 as white and 8 as black. This confirms that `m = 8` is an achievable maximum.\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that outlines this logic and prints the final equation and its solution as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\n    can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The size of the chessboard.\n    N = 16\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the problem constraints.\")\n    print(\"We have 'm' white queens and 'm' black queens.
