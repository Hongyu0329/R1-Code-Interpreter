    "This problem asks for the minimum area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line defined by `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Dual Problem Formulation**: I will rephrase the problem in the dual space. The condition that a convex set `K` (containing the origin) intersects the line `px + qy = 1` is related to its polar dual body `K*`. This transformation turns the problem of minimizing `Area(K)` into maximizing `Area(K*)` under a new set of constraints.\n\n2.  **Solving the Dual Problem**: I'll find the maximum possible area for `K*`. This involves using Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies, which provides a relationship between the area of a convex set and the presence of integer lattice points within it. The set of points to be avoided by `int(K*)` is `S = {(p, q) | gcd(p, q) = 1}`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Minimal Area**: Using the relationship between the areas of a convex body and its polar dual (the Blaschke-Santaló inequality), I can find the minimum area for the original body `K`.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Shape and Calculating the Area**: I will identify the specific geometric shape of the convex set `K` that achieves this minimal area. Finally, I will provide a Python script that calculates the area of this shape, explicitly showing the formula and the values used, as requested.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Duality**: Let `K` be a centrally symmetric convex body containing the origin. The condition that `K` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` (where `(p,q)` is a primitive integer vector) is equivalent to its polar dual `K*` not containing any primitive integer vector `(p,q)` in its interior. The problem of finding the `K` with minimal area is thus equivalent to finding the centrally symmetric convex body `K*` with the maximal area whose interior is free from primitive integer points.\n\n2.  **Maximizing `Area(K*)`**: According to Minkowski's theorem, any centrally symmetric convex body in `R^2` with an area greater than 4 must contain a non-zero integer point `v = (p, q)`. If this point `v` is in the interior of `K*`, then the primitive integer point `v' = (p/gcd(p,q), q/gcd(p,q))` associated with it must also lie in the interior of `K*`. Since we require the interior of `K*` to be free of all such primitive points, its area cannot exceed 4. The maximum area `Area(K*) = 4` is achieved, for instance, by the square `K* = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`, whose interior `(-1, 1) x (-1, 1)` contains no non-zero integer points at all.\n\n3.  **Minimizing `Area(K)`**: The Blaschke-Santaló inequality provides a relationship between the area of a centrally symmetric convex body `K` and its polar dual `K*`. In `R^2`, this is `Area(K) * Area(K*) >= 8`. To minimize `Area(K)`, we must maximize `Area(K*)`. Using the maximal area `Area(K*) = 4` we found in the previous step, we get:\n    `Area(K) >= 8 / Area(K*) = 8 / 4 = 2`.\n    Thus, the minimal possible area for `K` is 2.\n\n4.  **The Optimal Shape**: This minimum area is achieved when the body `K` and its dual `K*` are parallelograms. We already identified `K*` as the square `[-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`. The polar dual of this square is the set `K = {(x, y) | |x| + |y| <= 1}`. This is a rhombus (a diamond shape) with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0),` and `(0, -1)`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the area of this specific rhombus.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_minimal_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the minimal area of the convex domain K.\n    The minimal domain is the rhombus (diamond shape) defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The convex domain with minimal area is the rhombus defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.\")\n    print(\"Its vertices are (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1).\")\n    \n    # The diagonals of the rhombus connect opposite vertices.\n    # The horizontal diagonal goes from (-1, 0) to (1, 0).\n    # The vertical diagonal goes from (0, -1) to (0, 1).\n    d1 = 1 - (-1)\n    d2 = 1 - (-1)\n    \n    print(f\"The length of the horizontal diagonal (d1) is {d1}.\")\n    print(f\"The length of the vertical diagonal (d2) is {d2}.\")\n    \n    # The area of a rhombus is calculated as (d1 * d2) / 2.\n    area = (d1 * d2) / 2\n    \n    print(\"The area of a rhombus is given by the formula: (d1 * d2) / 2\")\n    print(f\"So, the minimal area = ({d1} * {d2}) / 2 = {int(area)}\")\n\ncalculate_minimal_area()\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
