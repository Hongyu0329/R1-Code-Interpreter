    "To solve the initial value problem, we will first find the general solution to the differential equation by separating variables, then use the initial condition to find the particular solution, and finally evaluate this solution at t=1.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Separate the variables:**\n    The given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$. We can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n    $$\n    Assuming $x \\neq 0$, we can separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n    $$\n\n2.  **Integrate both sides:**\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    The integration yields:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n3.  **Apply the initial condition:**\n    We are given $x(0) = -8$. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation to solve for $C$:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n\n4.  **Find the particular solution:**\n    Now substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n    Solving for $x(t)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n    To simplify, find a common denominator for the right side:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}{8}\n    $$\n    Invert both sides to get the final expression for $x(t)$:\n    $$\n    x(t) = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Calculate x(1):**\n    Substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find $x(1)$.\n    $$\n    x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1} = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1} = \\frac{8}{3}\n    $$\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final value based on the derived expression.\n\n```python\n# The particular solution for the initial value problem is x(t) = 8 / (-4*t^2 + 8*t - 1).\n# We need to find the value of x(1).\n\n# Value of t to substitute\nt = 1\n\n# Numerator of the expression\nnumerator = 8\n\n# Denominator of the expression\ndenominator = -4 * (t**2) + 8 * t - 1\n\n# Calculate the result\nx_1 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the equation with substituted values\nprint(f\"The final equation to solve is x(1) = {numerator} / (-4 * ({t})^2 + 8 * ({t}) - 1)\")\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The value of x(1) is: {x_1}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
