def solve_billiards_limit():
    """
    Solves the billiards problem step-by-step using sympy.

    The solution involves finding an exact expression for M(theta), the supremum of
    the reflection angle alpha, and then calculating its limit as theta -> 0.

    1.  Define symbolic variables.
    2.  Express the trajectory vector 'v' and the inner normal 'n'. The supremum
        of alpha is found for a path starting near x=1 and ending near y=C=5e^{i*theta}.
    3.  Calculate the dot product v . n.
    4.  Calculate the magnitudes |v| and |n|.
    5.  Compute cos(alpha) = |v . n| / (|v|*|n|).
    6.  From cos(alpha), derive tan(alpha).
    7.  Define M(theta) = arctan(tan(alpha)).
    8.  Calculate the limit of M(theta) as theta -> 0.
