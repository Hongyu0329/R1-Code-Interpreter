    "The primary question you've asked is a qualitative physics question about the optical properties of boron nanosheets. I will answer this question first. The request for a coding solution is best addressed by providing a script that illustrates the physical principles underlying the process in question.\n\n### Plan and Explanation\n\n1.  **Answer the Physics Question:** I will first explain the physics behind spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). The key requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is that it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). This property is intrinsically linked to the material's crystal structure; specifically, the material must lack inversion symmetry.\n2.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheets:** I will then discuss the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene). The common, stable phases of borophene are known to be centrosymmetric, meaning they possess inversion symmetry.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on this symmetry, ideal, defect-free boron nanosheets have a χ⁽²⁾ of zero and would therefore **not** be expected to exhibit SPDC. I will add the caveat that factors breaking this symmetry (like strain, defects, or interaction with a substrate) could potentially induce a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n4.  **Provide Illustrative Code:** To satisfy the request for a Python script, I will provide code that demonstrates the law of energy conservation in the SPDC process. The script will not analyze borophene itself, but will calculate the wavelength of an 'idler' photon that would be produced alongside a 'signal' photon, given a certain 'pump' photon. The governing equation is: `1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler`. The script will use example values and print the full equation with the numbers, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spdc_wavelengths():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function illustrates the principle of energy conservation in\n    Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n\n    SPDC is a process where one high-energy 'pump' photon splits into two\n    lower-energy photons: a 'signal' and an 'idler'. Energy conservation\n    dictates that the energy of the pump equals the sum of the energies\n    of the signal and idler photons. Since a photon's energy is inversely\n    proportional to its wavelength (E = hc/λ), this relationship can be\n    expressed in terms of wavelengths:\n\n    1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler\n\n    This script calculates the idler wavelength given the pump and signal\n    wavelengths.\n\n    Note: The question of whether a material *can* exhibit SPDC depends on its\n    crystal symmetry. Materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric),\n    like the common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets, have a vanishing\n    second-order nonlinearity and are not expected to exhibit this effect.\n    This script simply demonstrates the math if the effect were to occur.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- User-defined values ---\n    # Example values are in nanometers (nm)\n    pump_wavelength = 405  # A common laser wavelength (blue/violet)\n    signal_wavelength = 810 # A common case is degenerate SPDC where signal/idler are double the pump wavelength\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # The equation is: 1/λ_idler = 1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal\n    # First, check if the signal wavelength is physically possible (must be longer than the pump)\n    if signal_wavelength <= pump_wavelength:\n        print(f\"Error: Signal wavelength ({signal_wavelength} nm) must be greater than pump wavelength ({pump_wavelength} nm).\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the idler wavelength\n    idler_wavelength = 1 / (1 / pump_wavelength - 1 / signal_wavelength)\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"Illustrating Energy Conservation in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n    print(f\"Given a pump photon wavelength of {pump_wavelength} nm and a signal photon wavelength of {signal_wavelength} nm...\")\n    print(\"\\nWe use the conservation of energy formula: \")\n    print(\"1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the numbers to solve for the idler wavelength:\")\n    print(f\"1/{pump_wavelength} = 1/{signal_wavelength} + 1/λ_idler\")\n    \n    # Rearranging the formula to solve for the idler\n    print(f\"1/λ_idler = 1/{pump_wavelength} - 1/{signal_wavelength}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    # Using round to present a cleaner number\n    print(f\"The calculated idler photon wavelength is: {round(idler_wavelength, 2)} nm\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Verifying Equation:\")\n    # Showing the full equation with the calculated idler value\n    print(f\"1/{pump_wavelength} = 1/{signal_wavelength} + 1/{round(idler_wavelength, 2)}\")\n\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_spdc_wavelengths()\n```\n<<<No, ideal free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion because their common crystal structures are centrosymmetric.
