No, ideal free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion because their common crystal structures are centrosymmetric. This symmetry results in a vanishing second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a necessary condition for the process to occur.
