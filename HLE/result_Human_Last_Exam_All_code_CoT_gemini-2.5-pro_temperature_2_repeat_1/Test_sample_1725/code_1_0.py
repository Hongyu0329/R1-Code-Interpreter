    This function provides the solution to the crystal physics problem.

    Part A asks for the dimension of the fibers of the bundle pi, which represents the local state of the crystal.
    This is identified with the distortion tensor C_ij, a 3x3 matrix, which has 9 components.
    So, dim(pi's fiber) = 9.

    Part B asks for the number of coefficients specifying the energy functional E.
    The energy E must be a quadratic function of the dislocation density tensor (derivatives of C)
    and must be invariant under the cubic symmetry group O_h. The number of such independent
    quadratic invariants for a general second-rank tensor under O_h is 4.
    So, number of coefficients = 4.
