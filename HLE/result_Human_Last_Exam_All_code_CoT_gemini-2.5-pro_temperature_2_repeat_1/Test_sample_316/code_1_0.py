    Solves for the other critical exponent in the given harmonic analysis problem.

    The problem states that for the reverse square function estimate for the cone in R^3,
    the optimal exponent alpha is a piecewise linear function of 1/p, and its slope
    changes at two critical values of p. One is given as p = 4.

    Based on the theory of Fourier restriction for the cone, the known critical
    exponents are p=4 (the Stein-Tomas exponent) and p=10/3 (from the work of
    Bourgain, Wolff, and Tao on bilinear restriction estimates and Kakeya-type constructions).

    Therefore, the other critical exponent is 10/3.
