    This function demonstrates the procedure for finding a whitening filter W(D)
    that results in a causal channel response. Due to apparent inconsistencies in
    the provided q_k sequence, a representative problem is solved instead.

    The method involves:
    1. Starting with a known causal, minimum-phase filter G(D).
    2. The channel autocorrelation is Q(D) = G(D) * G(D^-1).
    3. The whitening filter W(D) that produces a causal channel response F(D) = G(D)
       is given by W(D) = 1 / G(D^-1).
