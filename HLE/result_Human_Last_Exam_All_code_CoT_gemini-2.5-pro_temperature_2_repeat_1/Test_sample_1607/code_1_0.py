    Analyzes the statements about quantum symmetries and determines which are true.

    Statement Analysis:
    A) False. The generator of spatial translations is the momentum operator p̂, which has a continuous spectrum for a free particle.
    B1) True. The condition [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0, with τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂, leads to the operator virial theorem 2T = r·∇V. For V ∝ r^k, this means T = (k/2)V. For this to hold for a subspace of states (specifically, zero-energy states), the potential must have k=-2. So V(r) ∝ 1/r². The system has a special scale invariance for this potential.
    B2) False. The transformation Ŝ†(θ)x̂Ŝ(θ) leads to x̂ → e^(2ħθ)x̂. The scaling factor is not e^θ as stated. The convention for τ is fixed by the problem statement.
    C) False. [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is a necessary AND sufficient condition for [Ŝ(θ), Ĥ] = 0 for all θ. One can prove this using the series expansion of the exponential and differentiation.
    D) True. Since [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0 implies [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0, we can show that Ĥ(τ̂|ψ⟩) = τ̂(Ĥ|ψ⟩) = τ̂(E|ψ⟩) = E(τ̂|ψ⟩). Thus, τ̂|ψ⟩ is an energy eigenstate with the same energy E.
    E) False. The operator for a rotation by angle θ around the z-axis is conventionally defined as e^(-iθL̂_z/ħ). The operator in the question, Ŝ(θ) = e^(-iθL̂_z), represents a rotation by an angle of θħ, not θ.
    F) True. This is a direct consequence of the Ehrenfest theorem for the time evolution of expectation values: d⟨τ̂⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[τ̂, Ĥ]⟩. The time derivative is zero for all states if and only if the commutator is zero.
    G) False. [Ŝ(θ₁), Ŝ(θ₂)] = 0 for a single generator τ̂ is always true since τ̂ commutes with itself. This condition provides no information about whether τ̂ is Hermitian. The unitarity of Ŝ, assumed in the primer, implies τ̂ is Hermitian, but the commutation relation itself does not.
    H) False. The spectrum of Ŝ is {e^(-iθλ)} where λ is in the spectrum of τ̂. An unbounded operator can have a discrete spectrum (e.g., the Hamiltonian of the quantum harmonic oscillator). Therefore, the spectrum of Ŝ is not always continuous.
    I) True. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula states e^A * e^B = e^(A+B) if and only if [A, B] = 0. Here, [−iθ₁τ̂₁, −iθ₂τ̂₂] = -θ₁θ₂[τ̂₁, τ̂₂] = -iθ₁θ₂τ̂₃ ≠ 0. Therefore, the equality does not hold.
    J) True. Given [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0 and Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩, we have Ĥ(Ŝ|ψ⟩) = Ŝ(Ĥ|ψ⟩) = Ŝ(E|ψ⟩) = E(Ŝ|ψ⟩). Thus, Ŝ|ψ⟩ is an eigenstate of Ĥ with the same energy E.

    The true statements are B1, D, F, I, J.
    Sorted alphabetically, they are: BDFIJ.
