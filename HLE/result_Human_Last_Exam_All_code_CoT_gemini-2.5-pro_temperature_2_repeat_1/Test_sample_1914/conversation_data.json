    "Answering this question requires a combinatorial case-by-case analysis of how categories can be constructed given the constraints. This is a problem of structural enumeration rather than a numerical computation. The Python code below outlines the steps of this analysis and calculates the sum of the disjoint cases to find the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Acknowledge Basic Categorical Axioms:** Any category with 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have two identity morphisms, `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\n2.  **Identify the Remaining Morphisms:** The problem states there are 4 morphisms in total. With `id_A` and `id_B` accounted for, we have 2 remaining non-identity morphisms, which we'll call `f` and `g`.\n3.  **Case-based Enumeration:** The core of the solution is to enumerate all possible structures by assigning a source and target to `f` and `g`. We will group these assignments into cases that are structurally similar. For each case, we determine how many non-isomorphic categories can be formed by defining the composition operation in a way that satisfies the category axioms (associativity and identity).\n4.  **Check for Isomorphism:** Within each case and between cases, we need to ensure we are only counting non-isomorphic categories. This is done by considering symmetries (like swapping the labels of objects `A` and `B`, or morphisms `f` and `g`) and by analyzing the \"matrix of morphism counts\" `(|Hom(A,A)|, |Hom(A,B)|; |Hom(B,A)|, |Hom(B,B)|)`. Categories with different matrices (up to permutation) cannot be isomorphic.\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total count is the sum of the number of non-isomorphic categories found in each disjoint case.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan by assigning the number of categories found in each case to a variable and printing the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef count_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \n    The approach is a case-by-case analysis based on the structure of the\n    morphisms. A category with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 total morphisms must contain\n    two identity morphisms (id_A, id_B). Let the two remaining non-identity\n    morphisms be f and g. We classify the possible categories based on the source\n    and target assignments for f and g.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Case 1: Both f and g are endomorphisms on object A (f: A -> A, g: A -> A).\n    # In this case, the set of morphisms from A to A, Hom(A,A), is {id_A, f, g}.\n    # For the category to be valid, this set must be closed under composition\n    # and form a monoid of order 3 with id_A as the identity.\n    # The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is a known result in algebra.\n    # By symmetry, having both f and g be endomorphisms on B is isomorphic.\n    num_case1 = 7\n\n    # Case 2: Both f and g map from object A to object B (f: A -> B, g: A -> B).\n    # These are two \"parallel arrows\". No compositions between f and g are possible.\n    # The structure is fixed by the identity axioms. Since f and g are symmetric\n    # (i.e., they can be swapped to yield an isomorphic category), there is only\n    # one unique category structure of this type.\n    # The case f, g: B -> A is symmetric and gives no new categories.\n    num_case2 = 1\n\n    # Case 3: One endomorphism on each object (f: A -> A, g: B -> B).\n    # Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f} and Hom(B,B) = {id_B, g}. Each of these must form\n    # a monoid of order 2. There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2:\n    #   1. The group C_2 (where f*f = id_A)\n    #   2. The multiplicative monoid {0,1} (where f*f = f)\n    # The categories are products of these monoids. The distinct pairs up to\n    # isomorphism (swapping A and B) are (C_2, C_2), ({0,1}, {0,1}), and (C_2, {0,1}).\n    num_case3 = 3\n\n    # Case 4: One morphism from A to B and one from B to A (f: A -> B, g: B -> A).\n    # Composition rules must be defined. The composition g o f must be an\n    # endomorphism on A. The only morphism in our set of four that is an\n    # endomorphism on A is id_A, so we must define g o f = id_A.\n    # Similarly, f o g = id_B. This fully defines the composition table and\n    # results in one unique category: the category representing an isomorphism.\n    num_case4 = 1\n\n    # Case 5: One endomorphism on A and one morphism from A to B (f: A -> A, g: A -> B).\n    # Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f} must be a monoid of order 2 (2 choices).\n    # The composition g o f maps A->A->B, so its result must be in Hom(A,B) = {g}.\n    # Thus, the composition rule must be g o f = g. This is associative for both\n    # of the order-2 monoid structures for Hom(A,A), so we have 2 distinct categories.\n    num_case5 = 2\n    \n    # Case 6: One endomorphism on A and one morphism from B to A (f: A -> A, g: B -> A).\n    # This is the \"dual\" of Case 5.\n    # Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f} is a monoid of order 2 (2 choices).\n    # The composition f o g maps B->A->A, so we must have f o g = g.\n    # This gives 2 distinct categories.
