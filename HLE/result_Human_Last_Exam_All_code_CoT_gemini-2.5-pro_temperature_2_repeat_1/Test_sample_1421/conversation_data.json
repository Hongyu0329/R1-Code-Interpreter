    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation is derived using the Feynman path integral formalism. This approach provides a powerful way to calculate thermodynamic quantities in quantum field theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Start with the Definition**: The partition function in quantum statistical mechanics is defined as Z = Tr[exp(-βH)], where β is the inverse temperature and H is the Hamiltonian.\n2.  **Introduce Path Integrals**: The trace operation can be expressed as an integral over all possible field configurations (paths) in imaginary time, τ, which runs from 0 to β.\n3.  **Specify Fermionic Fields**: Unlike bosonic fields, fermionic fields are described by anti-commuting Grassmann numbers (ψ and ψ̄). The integral is therefore a functional integral over these Grassmann fields.\n4.  **Impose Boundary Conditions**: The trace operation for fermions imposes anti-periodic boundary conditions on the fields in the imaginary time direction. This means a field configuration ψ at time τ must be equal to the negative of the field at time τ + β. This is a fundamental difference from bosons, which have periodic boundary conditions.\n5.  **Define the Euclidean Action**: The paths are weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action, `exp(-S_E)`. The Euclidean action `S_E` is obtained from the standard Minkowskian action by performing a Wick rotation (t → -iτ).\n6.  **Assemble the Formula**: Combine all these elements to write down the final expression for Z.\n7.  **Generate Python Code**: Create a Python script that prints the final formula along with an explanation of its components. To adhere to the prompt, the code will print each symbol or component of the equation sequentially.\n\nHere is the Python code that generates and explains the formula.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and prints the formula for the fermionic partition function\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The formula is constructed from its constituent parts to fulfill the prompt's\n    # requirement of outputting each component of the final equation.\n    # Note: Unicode characters are used for mathematical symbols.\n    \n    equation_parts = [\n        \"Z\", \" \", \"=\", \" \", \"∫\", \"  \", \"Dψ̄\", \" \", \"Dψ\", \" \",\n        \"exp\", \"(\", \"-\", \"S_E\", \"[\", \"ψ̄\", \",\", \" \", \"ψ\", \"]\", \")\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Adding the subscript for the anti-periodic boundary condition\n    # is tricky in a standard console.
