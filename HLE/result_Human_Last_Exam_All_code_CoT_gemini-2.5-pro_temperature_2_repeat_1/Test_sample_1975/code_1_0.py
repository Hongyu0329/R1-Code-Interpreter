def solve_order_type_problem():
    """
    This function outlines the reasoning and calculates the order type of the set X.

    The problem asks for the order type of X, where X is the set of infinite cardinals μ
    for which there is a "free" set of size μ. A set of indices x is free if
    x intersect (union of a_alpha for alpha in x) is the empty set.
    The setting is kappa = omega_7.

    A combinatorial set theory argument based on Ramsey's theorem and the properties
    of the given head tail weak Delta-system shows that there must exist a free set
    of the maximum possible size, which is kappa = omega_7.

    The argument proceeds by showing that any other configuration of set memberships
    within a large "homogeneous" family of sets leads to a contradiction.
    The only possibility left is the one that defines a free set.

    Therefore, we can find a free set of size omega_7. Since any subset of a
    free set is also free, it follows that for any infinite cardinal mu smaller
    than or equal to omega_7, mu must be in X.

    The infinite cardinals up to omega_7 are:
    omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7.
    We need to find the order type of this set of cardinals. As this is a finite
    set of elements in increasing order, the order type is simply the number
    of elements in the set.
