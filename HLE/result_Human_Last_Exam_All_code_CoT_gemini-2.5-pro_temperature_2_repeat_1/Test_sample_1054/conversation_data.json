    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the highest Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter threshold from the provided table where the diagnostic sensitivity is over 60% and the specificity is over 80%.\n2.  **Represent the Data:** I will codify the relevant data from \"Table 3\" — specifically the \"AM diameter (mm)\", \"Sensitivity (%)\", and \"Specificity (%)\" columns — into a Python list of dictionaries for easy processing.\n3.  **Apply the Conditions:** I will iterate through each data entry. For each AM diameter, I will check if it simultaneously meets two conditions:\n    *   `Sensitivity > 60`\n    *   `Specificity > 80`\n4.  **Identify Qualifying Diameters:** All diameter values that satisfy both conditions will be collected into a separate list.\n5.  **Find the Maximum Value:** The problem asks for \"at most, what\" diameter, which means we need the largest diameter from our list of qualifying values. I will find the maximum value in this list.\n6.  **Output the Result:** The code will first print the evaluation for each diameter threshold to show the logic, then it will explicitly state the final maximum diameter that meets the requirements.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_diameter():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter that meets the specified\n    sensitivity and specificity criteria based on the provided data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the table, stored as a list of dictionaries.\n    # Each dictionary represents a row with diameter, sensitivity, and specificity.\n    data = [\n        {'diameter': 4, 'sensitivity': 8.7, 'specificity': 100.0},\n        {'diameter': 5, 'sensitivity': 17.4, 'specificity': 97.4},\n        {'diameter': 6, 'sensitivity': 39.1, 'specificity': 94.7},\n        {'diameter': 7, 'sensitivity': 60.9, 'specificity': 92.1},\n        {'diameter': 8, 'sensitivity': 73.9, 'specificity': 84.2},\n        {'diameter': 9, 'sensitivity': 82.6, 'specificity': 71.1},\n        {'diameter': 10, 'sensitivity': 91.3, 'specificity': 55.3},\n        {'diameter': 11, 'sensitivity': 95.7, 'specificity': 42.1},\n        {'diameter': 12, 'sensitivity': 95.7, 'specificity': 31.6},\n        {'diameter': 13, 'sensitivity': 100.0, 'specificity': 18.4},\n        {'diameter': 14, 'sensitivity': 100.0, 'specificity': 10.5},\n        {'diameter': 15, 'sensitivity': 100.0, 'specificity': 5.3},\n    ]\n\n    # Define the required sensitivity and specificity thresholds.\n    sensitivity_threshold = 60\n    specificity_threshold = 80\n\n    print(f\"Searching for the maximum AM diameter where Sensitivity > {sensitivity_threshold}% and Specificity > {specificity_threshold}%.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    valid_diameters = []\n\n    # Iterate through the data to find all diameters meeting the criteria.\n    for row in data:\n        is_sensitive = row['sensitivity'] > sensitivity_threshold\n        is_specific = row['specificity'] > specificity_threshold\n\n        # Check if both conditions are met\n        if is_sensitive and is_specific:\n            valid_diameters.append(row['diameter'])\n            print(f\"Checking Diameter <= {row['diameter']} mm:\")\n            print(f\"  - Sensitivity: {row['sensitivity']}% (>{sensitivity_threshold}%) -> PASS\")\n            print(f\"  - Specificity: {row['specificity']}% (>{specificity_threshold}%) -> PASS\")\n            print(\"  Result: MEETS criteria.\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Checking Diameter <= {row['diameter']} mm:\")\n            # Show which specific condition failed\n            sens_check = f\"(>{sensitivity_threshold}%) -> PASS\" if is_sensitive else f\"(>{sensitivity_threshold}%) -> FAIL\"\n            spec_check = f\"(>{specificity_threshold}%) -> PASS\" if is_specific else f\"(>{specificity_threshold}%) -> FAIL\"\n            print(f\"  - Sensitivity: {row['sensitivity']}% {sens_check}\")\n            print(f\"  - Specificity: {row['specificity']}% {spec_check}\")\n            print(\"  Result: Does NOT meet criteria.\\n\")\n\n    # Find the maximum diameter from the list of valid ones.\n    if valid_diameters:\n        max_diameter = max(valid_diameters)\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n        print(f\"The AM diameter thresholds that met both conditions are: {valid_diameters} mm.\")\n        print(f\"The question asks for the maximum ('at most') of these values.\")\n        print(f\"The final answer is {max_diameter}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No diameter threshold was found that meets both criteria.\")\n\nfind_max_diameter()\n<<<8>>>"
