    "This is a film trivia question. My plan is to identify the movie and the specific scene. Then, I will create a Python script that stores this information and prints the answer for you in a clear format. The film in question is \"Good Will Hunting,\" and the character is Will Hunting. He says \"Thank you\" to the bus driver as he leaves Boston to follow Skylar, choosing love over a career and thus sealing his new path.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_quote_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and describes the film scene based on the user's query.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"Good Will Hunting\"\n    character_name = \"Will Hunting\"\n    action_description = \"says 'Thank you' to the bus driver\"\n    consequence = \"sealing his fate to pursue love instead of a pre-arranged career\"\n\n    # Print the details of the scene.\n    print(f\"In the Oscar-nominated film '{film_title}', the character {character_name} seals his fate by saying \\\"Thank you\\\" while boarding a bus.\")\n    print(\"\\nScene context:\")\n    print(f\"This happens at the end of the movie when he chooses to leave Boston for California to be with Skylar, turning his back on a prestigious job offer.\")\n    print(f\"The simple act of boarding the bus and thanking the driver signifies his final decision to follow his heart.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_movie_quote_scene()\n```\n<<<Good Will Hunting>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
