    "Of course. The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a classic organic chemistry reaction. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product, followed by a Python script to present the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The reactants are 1,3-butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a dienophile). Their reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Predict the Product Structure**: In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene's four carbons and the dienophile's two carbons combine to form a cyclohexene ring derivative. The dienophile (`CCl₂=CF₂`) is unsymmetrical in terms of its substituents, which can lead to two possible products (regioisomers). The major product can be predicted using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory. The most favorable interaction occurs between the parts of the molecules with the largest orbital coefficients (HOMO of the diene and LUMO of the dienophile). This predicts that the major product will be **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script using the `rdkit` library, a powerful toolkit for cheminformatics.\n    *   Define the reactants and the predicted major product using their SMILES strings, a standard text-based representation for molecules.\n    *   Use `rdkit` to calculate the chemical formula for each molecule.\n    *   Display the full chemical equation, including the stoichiometric coefficients (which are all 1 in this case), fulfilling the requirement to show \"each number in the final equation\".\n    *   Print the name, formula, and SMILES string of the final product.\n\nHere is the Python script to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# The user is asked to run the following python code to solve the problem.\n# First, you need to install rdkit library if you have not.\n# You can install it by running 'pip install rdkit' in your shell.\n\ndef get_diels_alder_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and displays the product of the Diels-Alder reaction between\n    butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        from rdkit import Chem\n        from rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Error: The 'rdkit' library is required to run this script.\")\n        print(\"Please install it by running 'pip install rdkit' in your terminal.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    # Step 1: Define reactants and the major product by their SMILES strings.\n    # SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a textual\n    # representation of chemical structures.\n\n    # Reactant 1: Butadiene\n    butadiene_smiles = 'C=CC=C'\n    \n    # Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\n    dienophile_smiles = 'C(F)(F)=C(Cl)Cl'\n    \n    # The major product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n    # This regioselectivity is predicted by Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory.\n    product_smiles = 'C1=CCC(Cl)(Cl)C1(F)F'\n\n    # Step 2: Create RDKit molecule objects from the SMILES strings.\n    mol_butadiene = Chem.MolFromSmiles(butadiene_smiles)\n    mol_dienophile = Chem.MolFromSmiles(dienophile_smiles)\n    mol_product = Chem.MolFromSmiles(product_smiles)\n\n    # A check to ensure molecules were created correctly.\n    if not all([mol_butadiene, mol_dienophile, mol_product]):\n        print(\"Error: Could not parse one or more of the molecular SMILES strings.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the chemical formula for each molecule.\n    formula_butadiene = CalcMolFormula(mol_butadiene)\n    formula_dienophile = CalcMolFormula(mol_dienophile)\n    formula_product = CalcMolFormula(mol_product)\n\n    # Step 4: Display the reaction details and product information.\n    print(\"The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder reaction.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\")\n    \n    # Printing with stoichiometric coefficients to show \"each number in the final equation\"\n    print(f\"1 {formula_butadiene} + 1 {formula_dienophile} -> 1 {formula_product}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Product Information ---\")\n    print(f\"Name: 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene\")\n    print(f\"Formula: {formula_product}\")\n    print(f\"SMILES: {product_smiles}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_diels_alder_product()\n\n```\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
