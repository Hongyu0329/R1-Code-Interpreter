    Analyzes different strategies for mitigating identifiability issues
    in time-varying birth-death models on extant-only phylogenies.
    """

    explanation = """
The core identifiability problem with time-varying birth-death models on phylogenies of extant species is that different combinations of speciation rates (λ(t)) and extinction rates (μ(t)) can produce the same likelihood. To mitigate this, a strategy must either add new information or constrain the model's flexibility.

Analysis of the provided options:
- A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: HELPS. This reduces the model's flexibility (a form of regularization), which constrains the possible solutions.

- B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: HELPS. Priors add external information, which narrows down the plausible parameter space.

- C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5: DOES NOT HELP. This strategy dramatically *increases* model flexibility and the number of parameters. This will worsen the identifiability problem by allowing even more parameter combinations to fit the data.

- D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors: HELPS. Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages, which is the key information missing from extant-only data.

- E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate: HELPS. This focuses inference on a parameter combination that is identifiable from the data, thus sidestepping the original problem.

- F. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny (probability of lineage removal after sampling = 1): HELPS. This is another way of adding direct fossil evidence of extinction.

- G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate: HELPS. Similar to E, this focuses on a more identifiable aspect of the process.

Conclusion: The only strategy that is counter-productive is the one that significantly increases model complexity without adding new data.
