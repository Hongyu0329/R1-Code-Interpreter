print("--- Problem Definition ---")
print("A dispersion point in a connected topological space X is a point x such that X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.")
print("The task is to find the maximum possible number of dispersion points in a compact connected metric space.")

print("\n--- The Proof that the Cardinality is at most 1 ---")
print("Let D be the set of dispersion points for a compact connected metric space X.")
print("We will prove that the cardinality |D| cannot be greater than 1.")
print("\nStep 1: Assume for the sake of contradiction that X has at least two dispersion points, d1 and d2.")

print("\nStep 2: Since d1 is a dispersion point, the subspace Y1 = X \\ {d1} is totally disconnected.")
print("Because X is a compact metric space, Y1 is locally compact and Hausdorff. In such a space, being totally disconnected is equivalent to being zero-dimensional, which means it has a basis of sets that are both open and closed (clopen).")

print("\nStep 3: The space Y1 contains the point d2. Since Y1 is totally disconnected and has more than one point, it is not connected. Thus, we can find a non-empty proper subset of Y1, let's call it V, that is clopen. We can choose V such that it contains d2.")

print("\nStep 4: Let W = Y1 \\ V. Since V is a non-empty proper clopen subset of Y1, W is also a non-empty, disjoint, and clopen subset of Y1.")

print("\nStep 5: Let cl(V) and cl(W) denote the closures of V and W in the original space X. The union cl(V) U cl(W) is equal to cl(V U W) = cl(Y1) = X. Because X is connected, cl(V) and cl(W) cannot be disjoint. Their intersection must be precisely {d1}.")

print("\nStep 6: The subspace cl(W) must be connected. If it were not, it could be split into two disjoint non-empty closed sets, which would lead to a separation of X, contradicting the fact that X is connected. Thus, cl(W) is a connected subspace of X.")

print("\nStep 7: We chose V to contain d2, so d2 is not in W. Furthermore, d2 is not in cl(W), because the only point cl(W) shares with cl(V) is d1, and d2 is distinct from d1. This means the entire subspace cl(W) is contained within X \\ {d2}.")

print("\nStep 8: By definition, d2 is a dispersion point, so the space X \\ {d2} is totally disconnected. Since cl(W) is a subset of this space, cl(W) must also be totally disconnected.")

print("\nStep 9: We have now reached a contradiction. In Step 6, we showed cl(W) is connected. In Step 8, we showed it is totally disconnected. The only topological space that is both connected and totally disconnected is a single point.")
print("Therefore, cl(W) must be a single point. This point must be d1 (from Step 5), so cl(W) = {d1}.")

print("\nStep 10: This implies that W = cl(W) \\ {d1} is the empty set. This contradicts our conclusion in Step 4 that W is a non-empty set.")

print("\nStep 11: The contradiction arose from our initial assumption that X has at least two dispersion points. Therefore, the assumption is false. A compact connected metric space can have at most one dispersion point. So, |D| <= 1.")

print("\n--- Achievability of the Maximum ---")
print("The Knaster-Kuratowski fan is a well-known example in topology of a compact connected metric space that has exactly one dispersion point.")
print("This shows that the maximum value of 1 is indeed achievable.")

print("\n--- Final Answer ---")
max_cardinality = 1
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
# As there is no equation, we simply output the final result of the deduction.
print("The maximum cardinality is:")
print(max_cardinality)
