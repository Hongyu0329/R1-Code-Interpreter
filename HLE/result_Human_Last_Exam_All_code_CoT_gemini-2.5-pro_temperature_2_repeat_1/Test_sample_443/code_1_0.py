def solve_covering_problem():

    Solves for the smallest integer k for the unit ball covering problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest integer k such that Z(P, T), a subset of
    the zero set of a real polynomial P of degree D, can be covered by O(D^k) unit balls.

    Let's analyze the problem by constructing a "worst-case" example that maximizes
    the number of balls required.

    Consider the polynomial family P(x, y, z) = 4x - T_D(z), where T_D is the
    Chebyshev polynomial of degree D.
    1.  This is a real polynomial of degree D.
    2.  The gradient is grad(P) = (4, 0, -T_D'(z)). The norm of the gradient is
        sqrt(16 + (T_D'(z))^2) which is always >= 4. So, P is nonsingular on its zero set.

    The set Z(P, T) consists of points on the surface 4x = T_D(z) that are inside the
    cylinder (x^2 + y^2 <= 1/4) and satisfy the angle condition.
    The condition x^2 <= 1/4 means |x| <= 1/2, so |T_D(z)| <= 2. This is always
    true for z in [-1, 1], where T_D is defined.

    The angle condition states that the angle between the tangent plane and the
    cylinder's direction (the z-axis) is > 1/10. This is equivalent to
    |grad(P)_z| / ||grad(P)|| > sin(1/10).
    So, |-T_D'(z)| / sqrt(16 + (T_D'(z))^2) > c, where c = sin(1/10).
    This implies (1-c^2)T_D'(z)^2 > 16c^2, or |T_D'(z)| > C for some constant C.
    This condition excludes regions where the surface is "flat" along z.

    Now, let's analyze the number of balls needed to cover the surface. This is
    highly dependent on the surface's curvature. The curvature of the curve
    x(z) = T_D(z)/4 is given by kappa = |x''(z)| / (1 + x'(z)^2)^(3/2).
    The folds of the surface occur where x'(z) is small, but these are not necessarily
    the regions of highest curvature relevant to the covering.

    Let's reconsider a slightly different polynomial to make the high-curvature regions
    satisfy the angle condition: P(x,y,z) = z - T_D(x/2). This is a polynomial of degree D.
    - grad(P) = (-T_D'(x/2)/2, 0, 1). The norm is always >= 1, so it's nonsingular.
    - Angle condition: 1 / sqrt(1 + (T_D'(x/2)/2)^2) > c.
      This simplifies to |T_D'(x/2)| < C' for some constant C'.
    - This condition selects the regions near the extrema of T_D(x/2), i.e., the "folds".

    The curvature of z(x) = T_D(x/2) is kappa = |z''(x)| / (1+z'(x)^2)^(3/2).
    Near the folds, z'(x) is close to 0 and z''(x) is large.
    T_D''(x) can be as large as O(D^2) at the extrema of T_D'. The maxima/minima of T_D(x)
    are located at x-values that makes x/2=cos(j*pi/D). There are about D/2 such folds
    in the interval [-1/2, 1/2] (which corresponds to x in [-1, 1]).
    The radius of curvature R at these folds is 1/kappa, which is O(1/D^2).

    A surface strip of length L (here L~1, the diameter of the cylinder) and small
    radius of curvature R requires approximately L / sqrt(R) unit balls to be covered.
    For one such fold, the number of balls is ~ 1 / sqrt(1/D^2) = D.

    Since there are O(D) such folds within the region of interest, the total number
    of balls required is O(D) * O(D) = O(D^2).
    
    This construction shows that for some polynomials, the number of balls required
    grows as D^2. Therefore, the smallest k must be at least 2. Standard results in
    the field suggest that this is also an upper bound.
