    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $g=6$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$. A Dirichlet character is primitive with a composite conductor $d$ only under specific conditions related to its prime factorization.\n2.  For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if it is a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ with prime conductor $p_i$, i.e., $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$.\n3.  The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$.\n4.  For a character $\\chi_i$ to be primitive for a prime conductor $p_i$, its order must be greater than 1 and must divide $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$. The number of such characters of order $k > 1$ is given by $\\phi(k)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n5.  We will count the number of combinations of characters $(\\chi_1, \\ldots, \\chi_k)$ that satisfy the order condition lcm(ord($\\chi_1$), ..., ord($\\chi_k$)) = 6. This can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Factorize the conductor d.\")\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(d_factors.keys())\n    k = len(primes)\n    print(f\"The conductor d = {d} has the prime factorization: {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}.\")\n    print(f\"Since d is square-free, a character chi is primitive with conductor d if and only if chi is the product of k={k} primitive characters chi_i, each with prime conductor p_i from the factorization.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyze the order condition.\")\n    print(f\"The order of chi is lcm(ord(chi_1), ..., ord(chi_{k})), which must be {g}.\")\n    print(f\"This implies that for each i, ord(chi_i) must be a divisor of {g}.
