    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nI will first outline the two fundamental philosophical problems with the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, excluding Gettier cases. These are:\n1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** This issue arises from the \"J\" (Justification) component.\n2.  **The Problem of the Criterion:** This issue arises from the \"T\" (Truth) component and its relationship to Knowledge itself, creating circularity.\n\nTo satisfy the unusual request for a code-based solution to a philosophical question, I will provide a Python script. This script will not \"solve\" the problem but will *illustrate* it by modeling the JTB definition with functions. The code will demonstrate how these two philosophical problems create logical dead-ends (infinite recursion and circular dependencies), making the JTB formula unworkable in practice.\n\nThe script will:\n*   Define a function to analyze a given belief according to the JTB criteria.\n*   Simulate the \"Regress Problem\" by following a chain of justifications until it hits a wall.\n*   Explain the \"Problem of the Criterion\" by showing how verifying 'Truth' requires pre-existing 'Knowledge'.\n*   Conclude by printing a summary \"equation\" using `1` for a successfully met condition and `?` for a problematic one, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef analyze_jtb_problems(initial_belief):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a belief using the JTB definition and demonstrates its two primary problems\n    (excluding Gettier problems).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing Belief: '{initial_belief}' using JTB model: Knowledge = Justification + Truth + Belief ---\\n\")\n    \n    # B for Belief: This is the easiest condition. We assume the agent holds the belief.\n    b_val = 1\n    print(f\"[B] Belief: The agent believes '{initial_belief}'. (Condition Met.
