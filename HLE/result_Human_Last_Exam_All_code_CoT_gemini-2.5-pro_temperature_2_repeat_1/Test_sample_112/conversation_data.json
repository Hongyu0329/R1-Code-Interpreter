    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  Identify the specific manuscript in which the Middle English poem \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved.\n2.  Examine the contents of that manuscript to find a text that can be described as a \"book of manners\" or a \"courtesy book.\"\n3.  Write a simple Python script that stores this title in a variable and then prints the answer in a complete sentence, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef find_companion_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\".\n    The poem \"Sir Launfal\" survives in a single medieval manuscript,\n    Cotton Caligula A.ii, now in the British Library. This manuscript is\n    a collection of various texts. Among them is a courtesy book,\n    which is a book about etiquette and manners.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The title of the book of manners found in the same manuscript.\n    book_title = \"The Boke of Curtasye\"\n    alternate_title = \"The Book of Courtesy\"\n\n    print(f\"Sir Launfal was preserved in a manuscript alongside the book of manners known as '{book_title}' (or '{alternate_title}').\")\n\nfind_companion_book()\n```\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
