    "Of course. This is a question in algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory. The solution involves understanding the connectivity of various topological spaces and how maps between them affect their homotopy groups. I will outline the necessary theoretical background and then provide a Python script that carries out the specific calculations.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map:** The map is `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. We need to find its connectivity. The space `Sⁿ` is the n-sphere, `ΩX` is the loop space of `X`, `X ∧ Y` is the smash product, and `ΣX` is the suspension.\n\n2.  **Use a key fibration sequence:** A known result in homotopy theory (due to F. Cohen, T. Ganea, and others) states that this map `f` fits into a homotopy fibration sequence:\n    `ΩS⁴ * ΩS⁶ → Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`\n    where `ΩS⁴ * ΩS⁶` is the homotopy fiber of the map `f`, and `*` denotes the join of two spaces.\n\n3.  **Relate map connectivity to fiber connectivity:** The connectivity of a map is one greater than the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. Thus, we need to calculate `connectivity(ΩS⁴ * ΩS⁶) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the connectivity of the fiber:** The connectivity of the join `X * Y` is given by `conn(X) + conn(Y) + 2`. Therefore, we need to find the connectivity of `ΩS⁴` and `ΩS⁶`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the connectivity of the loop spaces:** The loop space functor `Ω` reduces the connectivity of a space by 1. Since the connectivity of `Sⁿ` is `n-1`, the connectivity of `ΩSⁿ` is `n-2`.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the results:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations step-by-step, showing how the connectivity of the map is derived from the properties of these spaces and constructions. The script will print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map described in the problem\n    using established results from homotopy theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dimensions of the spheres in the problem.\n    n1 = 4\n    n2 = 6\n\n    print(\"This problem asks for the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^4 ^ Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 ^ S^6).\")\n    print(\"To find this, we use a standard result in homotopy theory which places this map in a fibration sequence:\")\n    print(\"F -> Sigma(Omega S^4 ^ Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 ^ S^6)\")\n    print(\"The fiber F of this map is the join of the two loop spaces, F = Omega S^4 * Omega S^6.\")\n    print(\"The connectivity of a map is 1 + connectivity(Fiber).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate connectivity of the individual loop spaces.\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Calculate Connectivity of the Loop Spaces ---\")\n    print(\"The connectivity of a sphere S^k is k-1.\")\n    print(\"The loop space construction Omega reduces connectivity by 1.
