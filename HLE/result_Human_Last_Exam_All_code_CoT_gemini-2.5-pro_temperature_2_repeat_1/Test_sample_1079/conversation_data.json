    "In this problem, we need to find the number of elements in the reflection group H3 that possess a specific property. Let's outline the plan to solve this.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:** The group is the reflection group of type H3, also known as the full symmetry group of the icosahedron. The problem mentions its Coxeter number, `h`, is 10.\n2.  **Understand the Question:** We are looking for the number of elements `g` in H3 for which there exists a \"regular\" eigenvector, and the corresponding eigenvalue `λ` has an order of 10. An eigenvector is regular if it is not left fixed by any reflection in the group. An eigenvalue having order 10 means `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 <= k < 10`. This means `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n3.  **Apply a Key Theorem from Reflection Group Theory:** A theorem by Springer and Lehrer states that the set of elements in an irreducible finite Coxeter group `W` that have a specific primitive `h`-th root of unity (`h` = Coxeter number) as a regular eigenvalue is precisely the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element `c`.\n4.  **Connect to the Calculation:**\n    *   Since all primitive `h`-th roots of unity correspond to elements conjugate to a Coxeter element (or powers `c^k` where `gcd(k,h)=1`, which are also conjugate to `c` in an irreducible group), the set of elements we are looking for is exactly the set of all Coxeter elements of H3.\n    *   The number of such elements is the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element.\n    *   This size is calculated as `|W| / |C(c)|`, where `|W|` is the order of the group and `C(c)` is the centralizer of `c`.\n    *   For any Coxeter element `c`, its centralizer `C(c)` is the cyclic group `<c>` generated by `c`, which has order `h`.\n    *   So, the final formula is simply the order of the group `H3` divided by its Coxeter number `h`.\n5.  **Find the values:**\n    *   The Coxeter number for H3, `h`, is 10.\n    *   The order of the group H3, `|H3|`, is the product of its \"degrees\", which are 2, 6, and 10. So, `|H3| = 2 * 6 * 10 = 120`.\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will divide `120` by `10` to get the final answer. The Python script will perform and display this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The reflection group of type H3 is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron.\n# Its order can be calculated as the product of its degrees: 2, 6, and 10.\norder_H3 = 2 * 6 * 10\n\n# The Coxeter number for H3 is given in the problem statement.\ncoxeter_number_h = 10\n\n# The number of elements in H3 having a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10\n# (the Coxeter number) is equal to the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element.\n# This is calculated by dividing the order of the group by its Coxeter number.\nnumber_of_elements = order_H3 // coxeter_number_h\n\n# Print the final calculation as requested.\nprint(f\"The number of such elements is calculated by dividing the order of the group H3 by its Coxeter number h.\")\nprint(f\"Order of H3 = {order_H3}\")\nprint(f\"Coxeter number h = {coxeter_number_h}\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{order_H3} / {coxeter_number_h} = {number_of_elements}\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"
