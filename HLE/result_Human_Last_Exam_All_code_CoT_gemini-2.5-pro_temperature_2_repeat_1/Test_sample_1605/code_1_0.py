# The number of homeomorphism classes for a given disconnection number D.
# We are asked to find this for D = 4.

# Let C(D) be the number of classes for disconnection number D.

# For D=1, there are no such spaces.
num_classes_D1 = 0

# For D=2, the only class is the simple closed curve (circle).
num_classes_D2 = 1

# For D=3, the only class is the Theta-3 graph.

print(f"Number of classes for disconnection number 3: {num_classes_D3}")

# For D=4, there are three fundamental classes.
# These correspond to the "4-irreducible" graphs, which are minimal 2-connected
# graphs with a disconnection number of 4.
# Class 1: The Theta-4 graph (two vertices connected by 4 arcs).
# Class 2: The K_4 graph (the skeleton of a tetrahedron).
# Class 3: The K_{3,3} graph (the utility graph).
