# Step 1: Use the boundary conditions to find the components of the initial vector x_0.
# From the condition x_{2025}^2 = 10^20, we deduce x_0^2 = 10^20.
x0_2 = 10**20

# From the condition -2/3*x_1^1 - 2/sqrt(3)*x_1^2 + sqrt(3)/(2*pi) = 0,
# after assuming a typo correction for r, we get the relation x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2.
x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 2: The value to be computed is equivalent to (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
# We calculate this value.
val_x0_1_sq = x0_1**2
val_x0_2_sq = x0_2**2
