The residues W365, Y382, I411, L415, and L430 in the human beta-1 subunit are hotspots for direct interaction with the alpha-1 subunit. Key sites for fine-tuning the channel's gating properties include the N-terminal domain (residues 1-70), the residue E390, and the Hook/V2 Loop region (approx. residues 170-220).
