    # Analysis Step 1: Approximate the ODE for large x
    # Original ODE: y''' = y^4 + (y')^4 - y''/(3x^2+2) + 1/(tan(x)+1)
    # For large x, we neglect the term y''/(3x^2+2) as it decays quickly.
    # The term 1/(tan(x)+1) is oscillatory. A rigorous treatment is complex.
    # We proceed by looking for a dominant balance among the core terms.
    
    # Analysis Step 2: Assume a power-law solution y(x) = C * x^n
    # The main terms scale as:
    # y''' ~ x^(n-3)
    # y^4  ~ x^(4n)
    # y'^4 ~ x^(4n-4)
    
    # Analysis Step 3: Find a balance by equating powers.
    # A potential balance occurs if y''' and y^4 have the same power.
    # n - 3 = 4n  => 3n = -3 => n = -1.
    # This implies the solution might behave like y(x) = C / x for large x.
    
    # Analysis Step 4: Determine the constant C from the balance.
    # If y(x) = C * x^(-1), then:
    # y'''(x) = -6 * C * x^(-4)
    # y^4(x) = C^4 * x^(-4)
    # Balancing y''' = y^4 gives -6C = C^4.
    # For a non-trivial solution (C != 0), we get C^3 = -6.
    
    # Analysis Step 5: Calculate C
    C_cubed = -6
    # The real cube root of -6
    C = math.copysign(pow(abs(C_cubed), 1/3.0), C_cubed)
    
    # Analysis Step 6: Formulate the approximate expression.
    # Rounding C to two decimal places.
    C_rounded = round(C, 2)
    
    # Although this approximation doesn't fully resolve the issues with the
    # oscillatory term, it's derived from a plausible dominant balance.
    
    # Final Answer Formatting

    expression_y = f"y(x) = {C_rounded:.2f} * x^(-1)"
