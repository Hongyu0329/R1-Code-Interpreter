    "This statement is True.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of variation in a trait that is explained by the additive effects of *all* common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered together. It can be thought of as the \"ceiling\" or the maximum possible predictive power you could achieve with a perfect linear model using those SNPs, where you know the true effect size of every single SNP.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool. A PGS is constructed using SNP effect sizes that are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). These estimations have inherent uncertainty and error because they are derived from a finite sample of people. Furthermore, PGS are often built using only a subset of SNPs that pass a certain statistical significance threshold.\n\nBecause a PGS is built using incomplete and noisy (estimated) information, its ability to explain variance in the phenotype (its R-squared value) will necessarily be lower than the theoretical maximum (the SNP heritability). The predictive power of a PGS can approach the SNP heritability as GWAS sample sizes become extremely large (reducing estimation error), but it cannot exceed it.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this principle. It first defines a trait with a \"true\" SNP heritability. It then simulates the result of a GWAS, which produces *estimated* (and therefore imperfect) SNP effects. Finally, it builds a PGS using these imperfect estimates and shows that its predictive ability is lower than the true SNP heritability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_vs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simulation to demonstrate that the variance explained by a Polygenic Score (PGS)\n    is lower than the SNP heritability of a trait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
