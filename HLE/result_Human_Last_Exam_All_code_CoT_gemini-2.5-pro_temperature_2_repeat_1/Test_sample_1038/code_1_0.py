    # Option A
    print("\n[A] Minimum-length/large-width transistors with a small gate capacitor (~1 pF).")
    analysis_A = """
    Pros:
    - A small capacitor and high-current transistors allow for a very fast reset time, meeting the < 5 microsecond goal.
    Cons:
    - Minimum-length transistors suffer from higher leakage currents (short-channel effects), which works against the goal of achieving a very high resistance.
    - Switching from a strong-inversion 'reset' state injects significant channel charge into the small capacitor. This disturbs the carefully set gate voltage, making it difficult to maintain a stable subthreshold bias.
    - Poor bias stability compromises the ability to handle the sensor offset accurately.
    Verdict: This strategy sacrifices core performance (high resistance, stability) for speed. It is a poor trade-off.

    # Option B
    print("\n[B] Split gate capacitor into segments refreshed by a two-phase clock.")
    analysis_B = """
    Pros:
    - Periodically refreshing the capacitor segments effectively combats long-term gate voltage drift due to leakage.
    Cons:
    - Adds significant complexity (switches, clock generator).
    - The clock-feedthrough and charge injection from the refresh switches will introduce noise and ripple on the gate voltage, appearing as periodic offset steps or distortion in the output.
    - The switches themselves are additional sources of leakage.
    Verdict: This addresses the leakage symptom but not the root cause, while introducing new sources of noise and complexity.
    """
    print(textwrap.dedent(analysis_B))

    # Option C
    print("\n[C] On-chip body-bias generator to increase the threshold voltage during operation.")
    analysis_C = """
    Pros:
    - Applying a reverse body bias increases the transistor's threshold voltage (Vt). A higher Vt pushes the transistor deeper into subthreshold for a given gate-source voltage (Vgs), dramatically reducing subthreshold current and achieving a much higher resistance.
    - A higher Vt creates a wider Vgs range for subthreshold operation. This increased margin makes it much easier to handle the +/- 100 mV sensor offset without driving the transistor out of the desired region.
    - During the 'reset' phase, the body bias can be turned off, restoring the normal (lower) Vt, which helps drive the transistor into strong inversion for a fast reset.
    Cons:
    - Body biasing consumes some voltage headroom, slightly reducing the maximum signal swing. However, for a +/- 100mV signal around a midpoint, the available swing is still sufficient.
    Verdict: This is a powerful, fundamental solution. It directly tackles the core challenge of achieving high resistance and offset tolerance at a low supply voltage by modifying the transistor's physical properties. It offers the best balance of all conflicting requirements.
    """
    print(textwrap.dedent(analysis_C))
    
    # Option D
    print("\n[D] Replace bootstrapping with high-impedance current mirrors for gate bias.")
    analysis_D = """
    Pros:
    - Completely eliminates the problem of gate capacitor leakage by actively holding the gate voltage.
    Cons:
    - This is no longer a bootstrapped resistor; the gate voltage is fixed. When the input DC level (source voltage) shifts due to offset, the Vgs changes directly, which can easily push the transistor out of the subthreshold region. This severely limits offset tolerance.
    - It loses the dynamic behavior and wide tuning range of the bootstrapped topology.
    Verdict: This approach solves the leakage problem but creates a more severe offset tolerance problem, making it unsuitable.
    """
    print(textwrap.dedent(analysis_D))

    # Option E
    print("\n[E] Use a single 'split-gate' transistor.")
    analysis_E = """
    Pros:
    - An interesting concept that could potentially be used for mismatch trimming.
    Cons:
    - Split-gate devices are non-standard in most CMOS processes and would require a complex custom design.
    - This approach does not inherently solve the primary issues of leakage, headroom, or offset tolerance any better than other options. The control scheme is also complex and unproven for this application.
    Verdict: Too complex, non-standard, and does not provide a clear solution to the main problems.

    After evaluating all options, Strategy C (On-chip body-bias generator) emerges as the most effective. It directly addresses the physical limitations of the transistor at low supply voltage. By increasing the threshold voltage, it allows for both extremely high resistance and provides the necessary bias margin to tolerate sensor offsets, without significantly compromising reset speed.
