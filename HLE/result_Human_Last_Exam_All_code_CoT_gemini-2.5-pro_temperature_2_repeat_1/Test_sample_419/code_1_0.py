    print(" - Antibody of interest binds MUC1 only with a TN antigen (GalNAc).")
    print(" - MUC1 protein has a FLAG tag.")
    print(" - A high concentration of free GalNAc (500 mM) is used as a competitive inhibitor.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 2: Determine the timing for adding the anti-FLAG antibody.")
    print(" - An anti-FLAG antibody binds directly to the FLAG tag on the target protein.")
    print(" - This means it functions as a primary antibody.")
    print(" - Primary antibodies are added during the primary incubation step.")
    print(" > Conclusion: The anti-FLAG antibody should be added with the primary antibodies.")
    print(" > This eliminates choices B and E.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Determine the reason for including the anti-FLAG antibody control.")
    print(" - The experiment aims to show that 500 mM GalNAc competitively inhibits the anti-MUC1-TN antibody.")
    print(" - A potential problem (confounder): The high concentration of GalNAc (500 mM) might have side effects on the cells.")
    print(" - The most critical potential side effect is causing the cells to remove the MUC1-FLAG protein from their surface.")
    print(" - If this happened, the anti-MUC1-TN signal would decrease because its target is gone, not because binding was blocked.")
    print(" - The anti-FLAG antibody's binding is independent of the GalNAc sugar.")
    print(" - By measuring the anti-FLAG signal, we can confirm if the amount of MUC1 protein on the cell surface remains constant, even in the presence of the inhibitor.")
    print(" > Conclusion: The anti-FLAG antibody is essential to verify that the inhibitor has not altered the surface expression of the MUC1 protein.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 4: Select the best answer choice.")
    print(" - Choice C: 'Anti-flag should be added with the primary antibodies. Its included to verify GalNAc has not altered surface expression of MUC1'")
    print(" - This aligns perfectly with our analysis of timing (Step 2) and reason (Step 3).")
