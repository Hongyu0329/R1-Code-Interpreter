    # The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.
    # The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base.
    # The reaction is an E2 elimination, which requires an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial)
    # arrangement between the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.
    # The substrate must be in the less stable di-axial conformation for the reaction to occur.
    # In this conformation:
    #   - Br is axial on C1.
    #   - The proton on C2 is equatorial (CH3 is axial), so elimination cannot occur here.
    #   - The proton on C6 is axial and anti-periplanar to the Br.
    # Thus, elimination occurs by removing the proton from C6.

    # The resulting alkene has a double bond between the original C1 and C6.
    # The methyl group is on the original C2.
    # Renaming this product according to IUPAC rules gives 3-methylcyclohexene.
