    "Of course, I can help you with this organic chemistry problem. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Substrate:** The stereochemical designation (1S, 2R) for a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane indicates that the two substituents (bromine and methyl) are *trans* to each other.\n3.  **Draw Chair Conformations:** For a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, there are two possible chair conformations:\n    *   **Di-equatorial conformer:** Both the bromine and the methyl group are in equatorial positions. This is the more stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position.\n    *   **Di-axial conformer:** Both the bromine and the methyl group are in axial positions. This is the less stable conformation.\n4.  **Apply the E2 Reaction Mechanism Rule:** The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an *anti-periplanar* (or *trans*-diaxial) arrangement. This means they must both be in axial positions, with one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n5.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   The E2 reaction cannot occur from the more stable di-equatorial conformer because the leaving group (Br) is not in an axial position.\n    *   For the reaction to proceed, the molecule must ring-flip into the less stable di-axial conformer, where the bromine is axial. Although this conformation is present in only a small amount at equilibrium, the reaction proceeds through it (Le Chatelier's principle).\n6.  **Identify Possible Products and Select the Correct One:**\n    *   In the di-axial conformer, the bromine atom is axial on carbon 1 (C1). We look for axial protons on the adjacent beta-carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position. Therefore, the proton on C2 is in the equatorial position. Since there is no axial proton on C2, elimination cannot occur to form a double bond between C1 and C2. The Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) cannot be formed.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two protons. One is axial and one is equatorial. The axial proton is perfectly positioned (*anti-periplanar*) for elimination with the axial bromine.\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract this axial proton from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n7.  **Name the Final Product:** The product has a double bond between what was originally C1 and C6, and a methyl group on what was originally C2. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules for alkenes, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2). This makes the methyl group located at position 3. The final product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the product of the given chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    # The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base.\n    # The reaction is an E2 elimination, which requires an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial)\n    # arrangement between the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.\n    # The substrate must be in the less stable di-axial conformation for the reaction to occur.\n    # In this conformation:\n    #   - Br is axial on C1.\n    #   - The proton on C2 is equatorial (CH3 is axial), so elimination cannot occur here.\n    #   - The proton on C6 is axial and anti-periplanar to the Br.\n    # Thus, elimination occurs by removing the proton from C6.\n\n    # The resulting alkene has a double bond between the original C1 and C6.\n    # The methyl group is on the original C2.\n    # Renaming this product according to IUPAC rules gives 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    product_number = 3\n    substituent = \"methyl\"\n    parent_alkene = \"cyclohexene\"\n\n    # Printing the components of the final product's name as per the instructions.\n    print(f\"The number in the final product's name is: {product_number}\")\n    print(f\"The substituent group is: {substituent}\")\n    print(f\"The parent alkene is: {parent_alkene}\")\n    print(f\"The full name of the product is: {product_name}\")\n\n# Execute the function to find the answer\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
