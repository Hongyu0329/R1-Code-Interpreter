    "To scan the Latin line, I will determine whether each syllable is long or short based on established rules of Latin prosody.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Syllabify the line**: Break the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" into its constituent syllables.\n2.  **Apply Elision**: Identify and apply elision, where a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel. In this case, `bene esse` becomes `ben' esse`.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Length**:\n    *   A syllable is **Long (L)** if its vowel is long by nature (like the 'o' in `soli`) or by position (a vowel followed by two or more consonants, e.g., the 'e' in `et` or the 'i' in `sit`). Diphthongs are also long. The dative `i` in `soli` is also long.\n    *   A syllable is **Short (S)** if its vowel is naturally short and it's in an \"open\" syllable (ends in the vowel).\n4.  **Group into Feet**: Based on the sequence of long and short syllables, I will group them into six metrical feet, as is appropriate for the line's probable meter (Iambic Senarius, which allows for substitutions). The final pattern is a mix of trochees, pyrrhics, spondees, and dactyls.\n\nBased on this plan, the derived scansion for each word is:\n*   `et`: L\n*   `tibi`: S S\n*   `ben(e) esse`: S L S\n*   `soli`: L L\n*   `quom`: L\n*   `sibi`: S S\n*   `sit`: L\n*   `male`: S S\n\nCombining these results in a 14-syllable line. I will group these into six feet to present the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the Latin line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n    \n    The scansion is determined by the following syllable-by-syllable analysis:\n    - et: Long by position (followed by 't' and 't').\n    - ti-bi: Both syllables are short.\n    - ben(e) esse: Elision occurs. 'be-' is short. '-nes-' is long by position ('ss'). '-se' is short.\n    - so-li: 'o' is long by nature. The dative 'i' is long by nature.\n    - quom: Long by position (followed by 'm' and 's').\n    - si-bi: Both syllables are short.\n    - sit: Long by position (followed by 't' and 'm').\n    - ma-le: Both syllables are short.\n\n    The resulting sequence is grouped into six feet.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    foot1 = \"L S\"  # et ti-\n    foot2 = \"S S\"  # -bi be-\n    foot3 = \"L S\"  # -n'es se\n    foot4 = \"L L\"  # so- li-\n    foot5 = \"L S S\" # quom si- bi\n    foot6 = \"L S S\" # sit ma- le\n\n    # Print the scansion with each foot separated by a space.\n    # The final equation shows the quantitative value of each syllable in the line.\n    print(foot1 + \" \" + foot2 + \" \" + foot3 + \" \" + foot4 + \" \" + foot5 + \" \" + foot6)\n\nsolve()\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
