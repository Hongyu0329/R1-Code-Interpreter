def find_mutualists():
    """
    This function identifies the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    The logic is as follows:
    - Mutualism for a plant typically involves pollination.
    - Adult pollinators benefit from nectar and the plant benefits from pollen transfer.
    - We evaluate each organism:
      1) Danaus plexipus (Adult Monarch): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
      2) Megachile frigidus (Adult Bee): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
      3) Formica rufa (Adult Ant): Nectar robber, not an effective pollinator. Not a mutualist.
      4) Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult Wasp): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
      5) Pepsis thisbe (Adult Wasp): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
      6) Megachile ericetorum (Adult Bee): Pollinator. MUTUALIST.
      7) Danaus plexipus (Larva): Herbivore, eats leaves. Not a mutualist.
      8-12) All other larvae (Bee, Ant, Wasp): Live in nests/burrows and have no direct interaction with the plant. Not mutualists.
