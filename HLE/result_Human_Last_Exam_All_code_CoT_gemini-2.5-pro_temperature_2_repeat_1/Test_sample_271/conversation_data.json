    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that solves the problem. I will first explain the overall plan, then provide the code that performs the necessary calculations and reasoning steps.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Polynomial**: The first step is to analyze the given polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We'll start by factoring it over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ to see if it breaks down into simpler irreducible components.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: For each irreducible factor, we will determine its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The splitting field $K$ of the original polynomial $P(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors. We'll determine the structure of the full Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ and its order. This will require checking if the splitting fields of the factors are disjoint.\n3.  **Apply Galois Theory**: According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ (such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) and subgroups of the Galois group $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup, $\\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n4.  **List Possible Degrees**: We are looking for degrees of extensions $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ for all proper normal subfields ($ \\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$). This corresponds to finding all proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$. The degree of such an extension is given by the formula $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H|$. We will identify the orders of all such subgroups $H$ and calculate the corresponding degrees.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan using the `sympy` library to perform polynomial factorization and Galois group computations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_field_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the possible degrees of normal intermediate field extensions for the\n    splitting field of the given polynomial over Q.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    P = x**7 - 2 * x**5 - 9 * x**3 + 3 * x**2 + 18 * x - 6\n\n    print(\"### Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and its Galois group. ###\")\n    print(f\"The polynomial is P(x) = {P}\")\n\n    # Factor the polynomial over the rational numbers\n    P_factors = sympy.factor(P)\n    print(f\"Factoring P(x) over Q, we get: {P_factors}\")\n\n    # The factors are (x**4 - 3) and (x**3 - 2*x + 3)\n    p1 = P_factors.args[0]\n    p2 = P_factors.args[1]\n    print(f\"Let P1(x) = {p1} and P2(x) = {p2}.\")\n\n    # These factors are irreducible over Q.
