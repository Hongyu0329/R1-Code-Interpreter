    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Request**: The goal is to simulate the one-dimensional cellular automaton known as \"Rule 110\". I need to start with a single cell in state '1' surrounded by '0's and run the simulation for 20 generations (or steps). The final output should be the binary pattern of the 20th generation.\n\n2.  **Represent the Automaton**: I will use a Python list of integers (0s and 1s) to represent the row of cells. To handle the edges, I'll use a list that is wide enough to contain the pattern's growth over 20 steps, padding it with '0's on both sides. A width of 61 cells is sufficient (`1 initial cell + 2 * 20 cells for growth + padding`).\n\n3.  **Define Rule 110**: The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by the 3-cell neighborhood (itself, its left neighbor, and its right neighbor) of the current generation. I'll use a Python dictionary to map the 8 possible neighborhood patterns (e.g., `(1,1,1)`, `(1,1,0)`) to their corresponding outcomes (`0`, `1`). The name \"Rule 110\" comes from the binary sequence of these outcomes: `01101110`, which is 110 in decimal.\n\n4.  **Simulation Loop**:\n    *   I'll initialize a list representing the cells, with a single '1' at the center.\n    *   I will then loop 20 times. In each iteration:\n        *   A new list for the next generation will be created, initialized with '0's.\n        *   I will iterate through the current generation's cells, considering each 3-cell neighborhood.\n        *   Using the Rule 110 dictionary, I'll calculate the state of each cell in the next generation and populate the new list.\n        *   At the end of the iteration, the current generation list is replaced with the newly computed one.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: After 20 loops, the list will contain the final pattern. I will convert this list of numbers into a single binary string, removing any leading or trailing '0's for a clean result, and then print it.\n\n```python\n# Plan: Simulate Rule 110 for 20 steps from a single '1' cell.\n# 1. Set up the environment: grid width, number of generations, and the rule dictionary.\n# 2. Initialize the starting state: a wide list of 0s with a single 1 in the middle.\n# 3. Loop 20 times to simulate the generations.\n# 4. In each step, compute the next generation based on the current one and the rule.\n# 5.
