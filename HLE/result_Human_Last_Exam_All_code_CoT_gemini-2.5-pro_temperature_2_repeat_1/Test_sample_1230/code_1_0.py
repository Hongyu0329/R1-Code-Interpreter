    Analyzes Charles's situation and provides a recommendation.

    recommendation = """
The first thing Charles needs to adjust is his diet.

Reasoning:
1.  Extreme Restriction: His diet limits animal protein, fat, AND carbohydrates simultaneously. Restricting all three major macronutrients is unsustainable and can lead to severe energy deficiency.
2.  Symptoms Match the Cause: His struggle to "keep up with the demands" is a classic sign of insufficient energy intake. Without enough fuel from a balanced diet, he will lack the energy for his new exercise plan and even daily work activities.
3.  Exercise Needs Support: Exercise increases the body's energy and protein needs. His current diet works against his fitness goals by not providing the necessary fuel for workouts and recovery.
4.  Medical Risk: Given his history of seizures, a very low-calorie or metabolically stressful diet could be risky. A more balanced and moderate approach is safer.

Conclusion:
Charles should adjust his diet to be more balanced and sustainable. Instead of severely limiting everything, he should focus on a moderate calorie deficit, ensuring he gets enough protein for muscle repair and sufficient healthy carbohydrates for energy to fuel his workouts and his busy life.
