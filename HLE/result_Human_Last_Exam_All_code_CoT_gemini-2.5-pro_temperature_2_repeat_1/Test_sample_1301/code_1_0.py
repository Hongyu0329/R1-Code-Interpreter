    This function returns the SMILES string for a molecule that fits all the given constraints.
    The constraints are as follows:
    - Molecular Weight: 258.11 g/mol (Monoisotopic Mass: 258.11034)
    - Formula: C12H18O6
    - Heavy Atoms: 18
    - Valence Electrons: 102
    - Formal Charge: 0
    - Radical Electrons: 0
    - Heteroatoms: 6 (5 ethers, 1 carbonyl oxygen)
    - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors: 6
    - Hydrogen Bond Donors: 0
    - Total Rings: 3
    - Saturated Heterocycles: 3
    - Rotatable Bonds: 0
    - Functional Groups constraints: Includes one carbonyl, five ethers. Excludes amines, thiols, esters, acids, hydroxyls, etc.
    - No F, Cl, Br, I atoms.
    - No carbocycles.
    - Contains a bicyclic arrangement within its tricyclic structure.

    The designed molecule is a complex, rigid, tricyclic keto-polyether.
    Its structure can be systematically named as:
    4,7,10,13,16-Pentaoxa-2-azatricyclo[5.4.4.1^{1,8}]hexadecan-3-one, with the Nitrogen atom at position 2 replaced by a Carbon, 
    resulting in an all-C/H/O structure. This complex fused and bridged system ensures zero rotatable bonds.

    SMILES representation of the molecule:

    # Breaking down the SMILES:
    # O=C1         : A carbonyl group C at pos 1, part of a ring.
    # ...OC2        : An ether oxygen, then a C at pos 2, starting a new ring.
    # ...C3OC4     : ...and so on, building the fused/bridged system.
    # ...C3C45      : Indicates C at pos 3 connects to C at pos 4, which is also a member of ring 5.
    # ...C12        : Closes ring 1 by connecting to C at pos 2.
    
    # As per instructions to output each number in the final equation:
