    # (a) Provide an expression for the minimum number of vertices a genus-g A-marked
    # graph must have for M_trop_{g,A} to be non-empty.
    # The condition for the moduli space to be non-empty is the stability condition: 2g + |A| >= 3.
    # If this holds, a stable graph with one vertex can be constructed by taking one vertex,
    # adding g loops (for genus), and attaching |A| legs (for markings). The valency
    # of this vertex is 2g + |A|, which is >= 3. So a 1-vertex graph is possible.
    # Therefore, the minimum is 1.
    answer_a = "1"

    # (b) Is it true that if g = 0, the moduli space M_trop_{g,A} is always a simplicial fan?
    # Yes, for g=0, M_trop_{0,A} corresponds to the Bergman fan of the complete graph on |A| vertices,
    # which is a well-known simplicial fan. Its maximal cones correspond to trivalent trees
    # and are simplicial. All other cones are faces of these, and thus also simplicial.
    answer_b = "yes"

    # (c) For g > 0, will M_trop_{g,A} be a tropical variety? If so, what is its
    # complex dimension? If not, will it still form a partially open polyhedral complex?
    #
    # First part: Is it a tropical variety?
    # No. For g>0, the space M_trop_{g,A} constructed as a colimit of metric graphs is
    # not balanced, which is a required condition for a tropical variety.
    answer_c_part1 = "no"

    # Second part (conditional on the first being "no"): Will it still form a
    # partially open polyhedral complex?
    # Yes. The space is constructed by gluing polyhedral cones (R^E_>=0) together
    # along their faces. This construction inherently produces a polyhedral complex.
    answer_c_part2 = "yes"
