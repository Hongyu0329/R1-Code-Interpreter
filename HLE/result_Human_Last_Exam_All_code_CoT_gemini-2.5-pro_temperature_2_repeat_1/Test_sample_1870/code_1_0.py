    # The problem asks for the minimal ordinal delta for a specific type of tower.
    # This value is known in set theory as the tower number for P(omega_1)/Countable, denoted t(omega_1).

    # A theorem in ZFC states that for a regular cardinal kappa that is not weakly inaccessible,
    # the tower number t(kappa) is equal to kappa^+, the successor cardinal of kappa.
    
    # Let's verify the conditions for kappa = omega_1.
    # 1. Is omega_1 a regular cardinal? Yes, by definition.
    # 2. Is omega_1 weakly inaccessible?
    #    A cardinal kappa is weakly inaccessible if it's regular and for all lambda < kappa, 2^lambda < kappa.
    #    Let's test for kappa = omega_1 with lambda = omega_0 (or just omega).
    #    The condition is 2^omega < omega_1.
    #    However, the set of all subsets of omega, P(omega), has cardinality 2^omega.
    #    By Cantor's diagonal argument, P(omega) is uncountable.
    #    The first uncountable cardinal is omega_1. So, 2^omega must be greater than or equal to omega_1.
    #    Therefore, the condition 2^omega < omega_1 is false.
    #    This means omega_1 is NOT weakly inaccessible.
    
    # Both conditions of the theorem are met.
    # We can apply the theorem t(kappa) = kappa^+.
