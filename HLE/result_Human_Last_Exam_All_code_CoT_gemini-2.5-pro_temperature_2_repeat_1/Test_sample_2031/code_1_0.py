    This function analyzes a poem to determine the symbolic meaning of 'opals'
    and prints the step-by-step reasoning.

    print("Plan: Analyze the poem to find the significance of 'opals'.")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------")

    print("Step 1: Identify the line and its immediate context.")
    print("The line is: 'Her keepsake eyes are opals, skin a moonstone'.")
    print("Her eyes are described as 'keepsakes', meaning they are holding onto something precious from the past: her memories.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the symbolic properties of opals.")
    print("Opals are unique gemstones known for their 'play-of-color'. Their appearance changes, showing different colors and flashes of light from different angles. This gives them a sense of depth, complexity, and changeability.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 3: Connect the symbol to the poem's larger narrative.")
    print("The poem sets up a strong contrast between two phases of the woman's life:")
    print("  - Past: A life of glamour, risk, and excitement ('velvet rooms', 'winning streak', 'fixing cards').")
    print("  - Present: Her 'bedbound years', where 'long-lost secrets... returned in nightly fears'.")
    print("The events of the past have not changed, but her perception of them has. The memories have shifted from sources of pride or excitement to sources of fear.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluate the options and conclude.")
    print("The shifting, multi-layered appearance of an opal serves as a perfect metaphor for her memories.")
    print("Like an opal's colors changing with the angle of view, the memories' emotional meaning changes with the perspective of time.")
    print("Therefore, the opals represent the rich, multi-faceted nature of her memories and how their emotional resonance has shifted over her lifetime.")
    print("Choice E, 'The shifting depth of memories', best captures this complex idea.")
