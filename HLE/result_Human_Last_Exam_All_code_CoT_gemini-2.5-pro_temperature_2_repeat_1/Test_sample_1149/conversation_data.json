    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a question of retrieving a specific fact from paleontological literature. The plan is to find the scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull and extract the relevant anatomical information. The code will then store and display this information.\n\nAccording to the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott describing the skull, the lacrimal recess is subdivided into two distinct parts: a shallower anterior depression and a deeper posterior depression.\n\nHere is the python code that reflects this finding.\n\n```python\n# The question is about the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.\n# Based on scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002), the lacrimal recess is subdivided.\n\n# Define the number of depressions in each subdivision.\nanterior_depressions = 1\nposterior_depressions = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions.\ntotal_depressions = anterior_depressions + posterior_depressions\n\n# Print the result in a descriptive sentence, showing the calculation.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions, resulting from its subdivision into an anterior and a posterior part.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {anterior_depressions} (anterior) + {posterior_depressions} (posterior) = {total_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
