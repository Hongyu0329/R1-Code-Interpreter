# The question is about the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.
# Based on scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002), the lacrimal recess is subdivided.

# Define the number of depressions in each subdivision.
anterior_depressions = 1
posterior_depressions = 1

# Calculate the total number of depressions.
total_depressions = anterior_depressions + posterior_depressions

# Print the result in a descriptive sentence, showing the calculation.
print(f"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions, resulting from its subdivision into an anterior and a posterior part.")
print(f"Calculation: {anterior_depressions} (anterior) + {posterior_depressions} (posterior) = {total_depressions}")
