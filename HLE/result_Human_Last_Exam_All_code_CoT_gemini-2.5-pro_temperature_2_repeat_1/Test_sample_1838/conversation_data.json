    "To find the central pixel of the line from (1,1) to (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixels that make up the line. Then, we can find the one in the middle of that sequence.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Set up the initial variables:** We start with the line's endpoints, (x1, y1) = (1, 1) and (x2, y2) = (11, 5).\n2.  **Calculate deltas:** We find the change in x (dx) and the change in y (dy).\n    *   dx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   dy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n3.  **Implement Bresenham's algorithm:** Since the change in x (10) is greater than the change in y (4), the algorithm will always step one unit in x for each point and decide whether to step in y.\n4.  **Trace the line:** We will loop from the starting x-coordinate to the ending x-coordinate, calculating the y-coordinate for each pixel and storing the results.\n5.  **Find the central pixel:** Once we have the complete list of pixels on the line, we can easily locate the central one by finding the element at the middle index of our list.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    pixels = []\n    \n    # Set up initial variables for Bresenham's algorithm\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    \n    # This specific case has a slope between 0 and 1 (dx > dy > 0)\n    # Initialize the decision parameter\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    # Iterate from start to end point to generate all pixels\n    # We loop dx + 1 times to include the start and end points\n    for _ in range(dx + 1):\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n        \n        # Decide whether to increment y\n        if p >= 0:\n            y += 1\n            p += 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n        else:\n            p += 2 * dy\n        \n        # Always increment x in this case\n        x += 1\n\n    # Find the central pixel from the list\n    # The middle index is the total number of items // 2\n    central_index = len(pixels) // 2\n    central_pixel = pixels[central_index]\n\n    print(f\"The line from ({x1},{y1}) to ({x2},{y2}) contains {len(pixels)} pixels.\")\n    #Uncomment the line below to see all the pixels on the line\n    #print(f\"Pixels on the line: {pixels}\")\n    print(f\"The central pixel is at coordinate: ({central_pixel[0]}, {central_pixel[1]})\")\n\nfind_central_pixel()\n```\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
