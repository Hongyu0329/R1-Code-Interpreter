    print(" - The set of all composants of an indecomposable continuum X forms a partition of X (i.e., they are disjoint and their union is X).")
    print(" - A key theorem in topology states that every composant of an indecomposable continuum is a 'meager set' (a set of the 'first category').")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Step 3: The Baire Category Theorem")
    print(" - This theorem states that any nonempty compact Hausdorff space (which includes all continua) is a 'non-meager set' (a set of the 'second category').")
    print(" - In simple terms, a continuum cannot be written as a countable union of meager sets.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Step 4: Deduction")
    print(" - Let's assume the number of composants is countable (either finite or countably infinite).")
    print(" - Since the composants partition the continuum X, X would be a countable union of its composants.")
    print(" - Because each composant is a meager set, this would make X a countable union of meager sets. By definition, this would mean X is a meager set.")
    print(" - This conclusion—that X is a meager set—directly contradicts the Baire Category Theorem.")
    print(" - Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. The number of composants cannot be countable; it must be uncountable.")

    print("Step 5: The Precise Number")
    print(" - A more advanced theorem in continuum theory specifies the exact number. For any indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is not just uncountable, it is exactly 'c'.")
    print(" - 'c' represents the cardinality of the continuum, which is the size of the set of all real numbers.")
