    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this topological question, followed by a Python script that presents the reasoning and the answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Key Terms:** First, I will clarify the definitions of the mathematical objects in the question: \"continuum,\" \"indecomposable continuum,\" and \"composant.\"\n2.  **State Relevant Properties:** I will state the essential properties of composants within an indecomposable continuum. The crucial properties are that they partition the continuum and that each one is a \"meager set.\"\n3.  **Introduce the Baire Category Theorem:** This fundamental theorem of topology provides a key constraint. It states that a continuum, being a compact Hausdorff space, cannot be a meager set.\n4.  **Logical Deduction:** I will combine these facts. If the number of composants were countable, the entire continuum would be a countable union of meager sets, which is itself a meager set. This would contradict the Baire Category Theorem. Therefore, the number of composants must be uncountable.\n5.  **Provide the Exact Number:** I will then cite the more specific theorem from continuum theory which states that the number of composants in any indecomposable continuum is not just uncountable, but is precisely *c*, the cardinality of the continuum.\n6.  **Final Answer:** This leads to the conclusion that the smallest (and only) number of composants is *c*. I will use a Python script to print this entire line of reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composant_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to determine the smallest number of\n    composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum, we follow these logical steps from topology:\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Definitions\")\n    print(\" - Continuum: A nonempty, compact, connected Hausdorff space.\")\n    print(\" - Indecomposable Continuum (X): A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\" - Composant: The composant of a point x in X is the union of all proper subcontinua of X that contain x.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Key Properties of Composants\")\n    print(\" - The set of all composants of an indecomposable continuum X forms a partition of X (i.e., they are disjoint and their union is X).\")\n    print(\" - A key theorem in topology states that every composant of an indecomposable continuum is a 'meager set' (a set of the 'first category').\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: The Baire Category Theorem\")\n    print(\" - This theorem states that any nonempty compact Hausdorff space (which includes all continua) is a 'non-meager set' (a set of the 'second category').\")\n    print(\" - In simple terms, a continuum cannot be written as a countable union of meager sets.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Deduction\")\n    print(\" - Let's assume the number of composants is countable (either finite or countably infinite).\")\n    print(\" - Since the composants partition the continuum X, X would be a countable union of its composants.\")\n    print(\" - Because each composant is a meager set, this would make X a countable union of meager sets.
