    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any of the 21 PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases, we can use a logical approach based on group theory and permutations.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal of PLL is to permute the last layer pieces (4 corners and 4 edges) into their correct positions. OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer) is already solved, so the top face is all one color, and pieces don't need to be flipped. We need to find the smallest number of side-sticker observations that can uniquely distinguish all 21 possible PLL permutations.\n\n2.  **The Parity Property:** A key property of the Rubik's Cube is that any legal move results in an even total permutation of its pieces. For PLL, this means the permutation of corners (`P_corners`) and the permutation of edges (`P_edges`) are linked. Specifically, the sign (or parity) of their permutations must be the same.\n    *   `sign(P_corners) = sign(P_edges)`\n    *   This means if the edge permutation is an even number of swaps (e.g., a 3-cycle), the corner permutation must also be an even number of swaps. If the edge perm is odd (e.g., a 2-cycle), the corner perm must also be odd.\n\n3.  **Information Needed for Permutations:** To uniquely identify a permutation of *n* items, you only need to determine where `n-1` of those items are mapped. The position of the last item is then automatically determined.\n\n4.  **Applying to Edges:** There are 4 edge pieces. To determine their permutation, we need to know the mapping of `4 - 1 = 3` edge pieces.\n    *   **How many stickers?** We can find out which edge piece is in a specific location (e.g., the Front edge slot) by looking at its single side-sticker. The color of that sticker uniquely identifies which of the 4 top-layer edge pieces it is.\n    *   Therefore, by observing **3 edge stickers** (e.g., at the Front, Right, and Back positions), we can fully determine the permutation of all 4 edges.\n\n5.  **Applying to Corners:** Similarly, there are 4 corner pieces. To determine their permutation, we would need to know the mapping of `4 - 1 = 3` corner pieces.\n    *   However, thanks to the parity rule (Step 2), we already know the `sign` of the corner permutation from the edges.\n    *   Knowing the mapping of 3 corners *plus* the required sign is enough to uniquely determine the permutation of all 4 corners.\n    *   **How many stickers?** Like with edges, we can find out which corner piece is in a specific location by looking at just one of its side-stickers. For instance, looking at the sticker on the Front face that belongs to the corner in the Up-Front-Left position will tell us which of the 4 corner pieces is there.\n    *   Therefore, by observing **3 corner stickers** (e.g., one from the UFL, UFR, and UBL positions), we can determine the mapping of 3 corners.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The total minimum number of stickers is the sum of stickers needed for the edge and corner sub-problems. This gives us `3` stickers for the edges plus `3` stickers for the corners.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the logic for determining the minimum number of stickers\n    needed to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The PLL step permutes 4 top-layer edges and 4 top-layer corners.\n    # Due to the mathematical properties of the cube (parity), the permutation\n    # of edges and the permutation of corners are linked.
