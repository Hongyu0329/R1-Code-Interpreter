    # Due to the mathematical properties of the cube (parity), the permutation
    # of edges and the permutation of corners are linked. Knowing one helps
    # constrain the other.

    # To uniquely determine a permutation of N items, one only needs to know
    # the destination of N-1 of those items. The last one is forced.

    # Observing a single sticker on the side of an edge piece is enough to
    # uniquely identify it.

    # Similarly, we need to determine the mapping of 4 - 1 = 3 corner pieces.
    # The permutation of the 4th corner is then constrained by the mapping of the
    # first three and the parity of the edge permutation.

    # is enough to uniquely identify it.
