    # Step 1: Characterize the set X.
    # X is the set of possible cofinalities of 2^omega.
    # From KÃ¶nig's theorem, cf(2^omega) > omega.
    # 2^omega is singular, so cf(2^omega) < 2^omega.
    # We are given 2^omega < Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    # Also, cf(2^omega) must be a regular cardinal.
    # Thus, X is the set of all regular cardinals mu such that:
    # Aleph_0 < mu < Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}

    # Step 2: Identify the elements of X.
    # The regular cardinals greater than Aleph_0 are the successor cardinals Aleph_{alpha+1}.
    # So, X = { Aleph_{alpha+1} | Aleph_{alpha+1} < Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}} }
    # This simplifies to X = { Aleph_{beta} | beta is a successor ordinal and beta < omega_{omega+5} }

    # Step 3: Find the order type.
    # The order type of X is the order type of its indices, the set of successor ordinals less than omega_{omega+5}.
    # This set of indices is order-isomorphic to the ordinal omega_{omega+5} itself.
    # The isomorphism is f(alpha) = alpha + 1 for all alpha < omega_{omega+5}.

    # Step 4: Construct and print the final equation.
    # The final equation is: Order Type of X = omega_{omega+5}.
    # We will print each component of this equation.
