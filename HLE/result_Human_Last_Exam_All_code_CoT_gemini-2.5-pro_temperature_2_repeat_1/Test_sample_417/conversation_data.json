    "To determine the number of peaks expected in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Overall Symmetry**: The molecule has a central 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring, which imparts a C3 rotational symmetry to the entire molecule. This means the three large substituent groups attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent. Similarly, the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent. We only need to count the number of unique proton environments in one of the three identical \"arms\" and add it to the count from the central core.\n\n2.  **Central Core Protons**: The central core is 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. The three methyl groups are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   **Signal 1**: The three methyl groups on the benzene ring give a single signal.\n\n3.  **Linker Protons**: Each substituent is connected to the central ring by a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   The three -CH2- groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\n    *   Within each -CH2- group, the two protons are attached to a chiral center (the entire camphopyrazole unit is chiral). This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will produce two distinct signals.\n    *   **Signals 2 & 3**: The methylene linker protons contribute two signals.\n\n4.  **Substituent Protons**: We now analyze the protons on one of the `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl` units. This is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system. Since there are no internal planes of symmetry within this unit, protons in chemically distinct positions will not be equivalent.\n    *   **Signal 4**: The single proton on the pyrazole ring (at position C3) is unique.\n    *   **Signal 5**: The bridgehead methine proton (at position C4 of the bicyclic system) is in a unique environment.\n    *   **Signals 6, 7, 8**: There are three methyl groups on the camphor-like skeleton. One is at a bridgehead (C7), and two are a gem-dimethyl pair (at C8). These three methyl groups are all in different chemical environments, giving three distinct signals.\n    *   **Signals 9, 10, 11, 12**: There are two methylene groups in the six-membered ring (at C5 and C6). In this rigid and asymmetric structure, all four methylene protons (H-5exo, H-5endo, H-6exo, H-6endo) are chemically non-equivalent and will each produce a separate signal. This gives four more signals.\n\n### Summary of Signals\n*   Central core methyl groups: 1 signal\n*   Linker -CH2- protons: 2 signals\n*   Indazole unit protons:\n    *   Pyrazole H: 1 signal\n    *   Methine H: 1 signal\n    *   Three methyl groups: 3 signals\n    *   Four methylene protons: 4 signals\n    *   Total from indazole unit: 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 9 signals\n\n**Total number of signals = 1 (core) + 2 (linker) + 9 (substituent) = 12 signals.**\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints this result step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the structure of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-\n    tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene and\n    calculates the expected number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the molecule to determine the number of 1H NMR peaks...\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\n    # 1.
