    print("\n1. Identify the dominant operations:")
    print("   The algorithm consists of an initialization step and a 'while' loop.")
    print("   - The initialization (Step 1) performs a fixed number of operations (assignments, division, subtraction). This is a constant time operation, O(1).")
    print("   - The 'while' loop (Step 2) repeats until its condition `q > 0` is false. The total time complexity will be determined by how many times this loop runs.")

    print("\n2. Analyze the number of loop iterations:")
    print("   The loop's execution depends on the variable 'q'. Let's trace its value:")
    print("   - Before the loop: q = floor(n / c)")
    print("   - After 1st iteration: The new q becomes approximately floor((n/c) / c) = floor(n / c^2)")
    print("   - After 2nd iteration: The new q becomes approximately floor((n/c^2) / c) = floor(n / c^3)")
    print("   - After k iterations: The value of q is approximately floor(n / c^(k+1))")

    print("\n3. Determine the loop's termination:")
    print("   - The loop stops when `q` is no longer greater than 0 (i.e., `q = 0`).")
    print("   - This happens when `n / c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1.")
    print("   - Mathematically: n / c^k < 1  =>  n < c^k  =>  log_c(n) < k.")
    print("   - This means the number of iterations, `k`, is proportional to log_c(n). The number of iterations is essentially the number of digits in the base-c representation of the number n.")
    
    print("\n4. Analyze the cost of each iteration:")
    print("   - The work done inside the loop consists of a few basic arithmetic operations (i := i + 1, x := q, q := floor(x/c), a_i := x - qc).")
    print("   - Each of these operations takes constant time. Therefore, the cost of a single loop iteration is constant, or O(1).")

    print("\n5. Calculate the Total Time Complexity:")
    print("   - Total Complexity = (Number of Iterations) * (Cost per Iteration)")
    print("   - Total Complexity â‰ˆ (log_c n) * O(1)")
    print("   - In Big O notation, this is written as O(log_c n).")
    print("\n   - Note: In complexity analysis, the base of the logarithm is usually considered a constant factor (since log_c(n) = log(n)/log(c)), so the complexity is commonly simplified to O(log n).")
