    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we will analyze the number of fundamental operations it performs, focusing on how this number grows as the input `n` increases.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the main loop:** The core of the algorithm's work is done inside the `while q > 0` loop.\n2.  **Count iterations:** We will determine how many times the loop runs. This depends on how the value of `q` changes in each step.\n3.  **Analyze loop body:** We'll look at the operations inside the loop to see if they take constant time.\n4.  **Combine the findings:** The total time complexity will be the number of iterations multiplied by the cost of each iteration.\n5.  **Express in Big O notation:** We'll write the final complexity using Big O notation, simplifying it to its most common form.\n\nThe Python script below will print this step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the computational time complexity of the provided IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step Analysis of IMAG(n, c) Time Complexity:\")\n    print(\"======================================================\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1.

This is a constant time operation, O(1).\")\n    print(\"   - The 'while' loop (Step 2) repeats until its condition `q > 0` is false. The total time complexity will be determined by how many times this loop runs.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n2.
