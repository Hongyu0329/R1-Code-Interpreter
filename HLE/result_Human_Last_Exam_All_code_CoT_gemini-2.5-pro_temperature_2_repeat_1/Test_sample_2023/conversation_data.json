    "My plan to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function `f(a,b,c)`**: The recurrence relation `f(a,b,c)=f(a-1,b,c)+f(a,b-2,c)+f(a,b,c-3)` with base case `f(0,0,0)=1` implies that `f(a,b,c)` counts the number of ways to reach point `(a,b,c)` from the origin using steps `(1,0,0)`, `(0,2,0)`, and `(0,0,3)`. This is non-zero only if `b` is even and `c` is a multiple of 3. In that case, `f(a,b,c)` is given by the multinomial coefficient `(a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)`.\n\n2.  **Simplify Arguments Modulo p**: We need to compute `f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod{p}`. Due to the properties of factorials modulo a prime `p`, we can't simply reduce the arguments `\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p` modulo `p` first. We must use Lucas's Theorem.\n\n3.  **Apply Lucas's Theorem**: Lucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients states that `C(n, k_1, ..., k_m) \\equiv \\prod_{i=0}^{d} C(n_i, k_{1,i}, ..., k_{m,i}) \\pmod p`, where `n_i` and `k_{j,i}` are the base-`p` digits. To apply this, we need the base-`p` representation of the arguments of our multinomial coefficient: `a = \\alpha_p`, `b_2 = \\beta_p/2`, and `c_3 = \\gamma_p/3`.\n\n4.  **Determine Base-p Digits**: By expanding the definitions of `\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p`, we can find the base-`p` representation of `a`, `b_2`, and `c_3`.\n    *   `a_k` (digit k of `\\alpha_p`): `1` if `k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`, `3` if `k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`, `4` if `k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`.\n    *   `b_{2,k}` (digit k of `\\beta_p/2`): `4` if `k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`, `2` if `k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`, `2` if `k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`.\n    *   `c_{3,k}` (digit k of `\\gamma_p/3`): `1` if `k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`, `3` if `k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`, `4` if `k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`.\n    The sum `N = a+b_2+c_3 = 2a+b_2`, so its k-th digit `N_k` is `2a_k+b_{2,k}` (as there are no carries).\n    *   `N_k`: `6` if `k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`, `8` if `k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`, `10` if `k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Component Multinomials**: The result is a product of `C(N_k, a_k, b_{2,k}, c_{3,k}) \\pmod p` for each digit `k`. We have three repeating cases:\n    *   `k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`: `T_0 = C(6, 1, 4, 1) = 6!/(1!4!1!) = 30`.\n    *   `k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`: `T_1 = C(8, 3, 2, 3) = 8!/(3!2!3!) = 560`.\n    *   `k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`: `T_2 = C(10, 4, 2, 4) = 10!/(4!2!4!) = 3150`.\n\n6.  **Determine the Number of repetitions**: The product extends up to `k_{max} = (9p+1)/2`, which is the highest power in the base-`p` expansion. For `p = 2^{127}-1`, it can be shown that `p \\equiv 7 \\pmod{12}`. This implies that the number of occurrences for each of the three cases is the same. Let this count be `C`. The value is `C = (3p+1)/2`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: The required value is `(T_0 \\cdot T_1 \\cdot T_2)^C \\pmod p`. Let `V = T_0 \\cdot T_1 \\cdot T_2 = 52,920,000`. We need `V^C \\pmod p`.\n    The exponent is `C = (3p+1)/2 = 3(p-1)/2 + 2`.\n    So, `V^C \\equiv V^{3(p-1)/2 + 2} \\equiv (V^{(p-1)/2})^3 \\cdot V^2 \\pmod p`.\n    By Euler's criterion, `V^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv (V/p) \\pmod p` (Legendre symbol).\n    The prime factors of V are 2, 3, 5, 7. We can show that `(V/p) = (3/p)`.\n    Using quadratic reciprocity with `p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3` and `p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4`, we get `(3/p) = -1`.\n    Therefore, the final result is `(-1)^3 \\cdot V^2 \\equiv -V^2 \\pmod p`, which is `p - V^2`.\n\nThe following Python code performs this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The problem reduces to calculating p - V^2, where p is the given prime\n# and V is the product of three multinomial coefficients.\n\n# The Mersenne prime p = 2^127 - 1\np = (2**127) - 1\n\n# The three repeating multinomial coefficients calculated from the base-p digits.\n# T0 = C(6, 1, 4, 1)\n# T1 = C(8, 3, 2, 3)\n# T2 = C(10, 4, 2, 4)\nT0 = 30\nT1 = 560\nT2 = 3150\n\n# V is the product of these coefficients.\nV = T0 * T1 * T2\n\n# V_squared is V^2, the value to be subtracted from p.\nV_squared = V**2\n\n# The final result of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p.\nresult = p - V_squared\n\n# Output each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The result is derived from the equation: p - (T0 * T1 * T2)^2\")\nprint(f\"Final calculation: {p} - {V_squared} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<170141183460469231731687303715884105727 - 2800526400000000 = 170141183460469231731687303715881305201>>>"
