    This function determines the number of nodes in the smallest Kripke countermodel
    for the given intuitionistic propositional formula.
    
    The formula is:
    [[[(A0 -> B0) v (~A0 -> B0)] -> B1] ^ [[(A1 -> B1) v (~A1 -> B1)] -> B2]] -> B2
    
    The analysis shows that this formula is a theorem in intuitionistic logic.
    A logical theorem is a formula that is true in all possible worlds of all Kripke models.
    Therefore, by definition, no countermodel exists for it.
    
    A countermodel must have a non-empty set of worlds (nodes), so if no such
    model exists, the number of nodes it contains is 0.
