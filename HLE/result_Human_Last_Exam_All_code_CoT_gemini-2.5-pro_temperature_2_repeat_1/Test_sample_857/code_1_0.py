    print("A key theorem in continuum theory (by J.J. Charatonik and W.J. Charatonik) states:")
    print("For a hereditarily decomposable continuum, the set of points where it fails to be coastal is precisely its set of endpoints.")
    print("\nTherefore, the problem is simplified to: What is the largest possible number of endpoints in a hereditarily decomposable continuum?")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Constructing a Maximizing Example ---")
    print("To find this maximum, we can construct an example. A classic example is the 'Cantor fan'.")
    print("The Cantor fan is created by taking the cone over the Cantor set. All points in the Cantor set are connected by straight lines to a single apex point.")
    print("This construction results in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.")
    print("In this Cantor fan, the set of endpoints is precisely the Cantor set itself.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Determining the Cardinality ---")
    print("The standard (middle-thirds) Cantor set is known to have a cardinality of 2 to the power of Aleph-null (\\u2135).")
    print("This cardinality is known as the 'cardinality of the continuum', denoted by 'c'.")
    print("So, we have an example of a hereditarily decomposable continuum with 'c' endpoints.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Confirming the Maximum ---")
    print("The set of endpoints (non-coastal points) is a subset of the entire space X.")
    print("A non-degenerate continuum (like the Cantor fan) has a cardinality of 'c'.")
    print("Therefore, the number of endpoints cannot exceed 'c'.")

    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Since we found an example with 'c' non-coastal points and the number cannot be greater than 'c', the maximum possible cardinality is 'c'.")

    # is associated with the set of natural numbers, starting with 0.
