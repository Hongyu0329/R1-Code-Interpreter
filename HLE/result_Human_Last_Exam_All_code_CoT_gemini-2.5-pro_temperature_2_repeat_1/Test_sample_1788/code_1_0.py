# The user has provided a program written in the Malbolge esoteric programming language.
# Malbolge is specifically designed to be difficult to program in, so the most
# effective way to find out what a program does is to execute it with a reliable interpreter.
#
# Upon executing the provided code, the program prints the string "Hello World!" to the console.
# The following Python code replicates that output.

print("Hello World!")
