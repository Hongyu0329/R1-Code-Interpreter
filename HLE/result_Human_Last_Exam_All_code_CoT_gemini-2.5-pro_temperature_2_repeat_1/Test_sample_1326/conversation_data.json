    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$. Since the definition of the function $p(x)$ changes at $x=3$, we must split the integral into two parts.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Split the integral**: The total integral $\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx$ will be calculated as the sum of two separate integrals:\n    *   The integral of the first part of the function, $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$, from $x=0$ to $x=3$.\n    *   The integral of the second part of the function, $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$, from $x=3$ to $x=4$.\n2.  **Calculate each integral**: We will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically calculate the value of each integral. This is a robust way to handle definite integrals, especially for complex functions.\n3.  **Sum the results**: The final answer is the sum of the values of the two integrals.\n4.  **Present the output**: The Python script will print the value of each integral, show the final summation, and output the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the integral of the given piecewise function\n    from x=0 to x=4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the two parts of the function p(x)\n    def p1(x):\n        \"\"\"p(x) for 0 <= x <= 3\"\"\"\n        return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n    def p2(x):\n        \"\"\"p(x) for 3 <= x <= 5\"\"\"\n        return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n    # Calculate the integral for the first part (0 to 3)\n    # The result of quad is a tuple (value, estimated_error)\n    integral1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n    # Calculate the integral for the second part (3 to 4)\n    integral2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n    # Calculate the total integral by summing the two parts\n    total_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"The integral from x = 0 to x = 4 is split into two parts:\")\n    print(f\"1.
