# The analysis of the poem's structure reveals a specific error in the final three lines (the envoi).
# The sestina form requires the envoi to contain all six key end-words from the poem:
# mountains, valleys, forests, music, morning, and evening.
#
# The given envoi (lines 73-75) is as follows:
# 73: ...mountains ...valleys
# 74: ...music
# 75: ...morning ...evening
# This envoi is missing the word 'forests'. This proves that line 74 is incorrect.
#
# A line ending in 'forests' must have been swapped with line 74.
# Line 74 ("Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music") fits thematically in Stanza 6,
# where the speaker Klaius has already mentioned his "strange exclaiming music" (line 32).
# The original line at that position, line 35, ends in 'forests'.
# Swapping line 35 ("Long since my thoughts chase me like beasts in forests") with line 74
# corrects the envoi and breaks the required end-word pattern in Stanza 6, fulfilling all
# conditions of the puzzle.

swapped_line_one = 35
swapped_line_two = 74

print(f"{swapped_line_one} and {swapped_line_two}")
