    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we will denote as $p_i$, we need to solve the system of equations when the derivatives are zero, as the probabilities are constant at steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$).\n\n**Our Plan:**\n\n1.  **Set up the Steady-State Equations:** By setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ in the given system, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n    *   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    *   And the normalization condition: $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n2.  **Solve for Probabilities:** We will solve this system by expressing $p_0, p_2,$ and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n    *   From the first equation, we get an expression for $p_0$.\n    *   From the second equation, we get an expression for $p_2$.\n    *   From the third equation, we get an expression for $p_3$ (which will depend on $p_2$, and thus on $p_1$).\n\n3.  **Use the Normalization Condition:** Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation ($p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$). This allows us to solve for the numerical value of $p_1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Sum:** Once we have $p_1$, we can easily calculate $p_0$. The final step is to compute the desired sum, $p_0 + p_1$.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** The code will perform these algebraic steps numerically to find the values of $p_0$ and $p_1$ and then compute their sum, printing the result in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_kolmogorov_steady_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Kolmogorov-Chapman system for steady-state probabilities and calculates P0 + P1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given transition rates\n    lambda01 = 0.019\n    lambda10 = 0.65\n    lambda12 = 0.4\n    lambda21 = 0.392\n    lambda23 = 0.008\n    lambda31 = 0.008\n\n    # At steady state (t -> +inf), derivatives P_i'(t) are 0.\n    # The system becomes a set of linear equations for probabilities p_i = P_i(+inf).\n    #\n    # From P_0'(t) = 0:  lambda01 * p0 = lambda10 * p1  => p0 = (lambda10 / lambda01) * p1\n    # From P_2'(t) = 0:  (lambda21 + lambda23) * p2 = lambda12 * p1 => p2 = (lambda12 / (lambda21 + lambda23)) * p1\n    # From P_3'(t) = 0:  lambda31 * p3 = lambda23 * p2 => p3 = (lambda23 / lambda31) * p2\n    #\n    # We express p0, p2, and p3 as multiples of p1.
