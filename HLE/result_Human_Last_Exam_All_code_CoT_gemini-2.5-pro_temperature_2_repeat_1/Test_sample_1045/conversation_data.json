    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we first need to understand how many functions this basis set assigns to each type of atom.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set:**\n    *   For a Hydrogen (H) atom, the 1s orbital is described by two basis functions (a split-valence): one function contracted from 3 primitive Gaussians and another single primitive Gaussian. Total = 2 basis functions.\n    *   For a second-row atom like Carbon (C), the core 1s orbital is described by one contracted function (from 6 primitives). The valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is split. This results in one set of inner functions (s and p) and one set of outer functions (s and p). This gives 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence s, p) + 4 (outer valence s, p) = 9 basis functions.\n\n2.  **Count the Atoms in Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Functions:**\n    *   The total is the sum of functions from all atoms: `(Number of C atoms * Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms * Functions per H)`.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python script below.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_basis_functions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8)\n    with a 6-31G basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Molecular formula of toluene is C7H8\n    num_carbon = 7\n    num_hydrogen = 8\n\n    # Number of basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n    # For Carbon (C): 1 core function (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\n    functions_per_carbon = 9\n    # For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\n    functions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n    # Calculate the total number of basis functions\n    total_carbon_functions = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\n    total_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\n    total_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n    # Print the explanation and the calculation\n    print(\"For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8):\")\n    print(f\"1.
