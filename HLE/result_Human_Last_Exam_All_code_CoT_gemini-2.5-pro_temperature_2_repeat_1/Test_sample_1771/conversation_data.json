    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to trace the etymological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word through the requested languages.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE form:** Break down `*seh₂gieti` to identify its root and the phonemes involved. The key parts are the `s`, the `e`, the laryngeal `h₂`, the voiced velar `g`, and the present-tense suffix `-yeti`.\n2.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** Apply the primary sound changes.\n    *   The laryngeal `h₂` will color the preceding `e` to an `a`.\n    *   PIE `*ā` (from `*eh₂`) will become PGmc `*ō`.\n    *   **Grimm's Law** will transform the PIE voiced stop `g` into a voiceless stop `k`.\n    *   The PIE verbal suffix `-yeti` corresponds to the PGmc class 1 weak verb infinitive `*-janą`.\n3.  **PGmc to Old Norse (ON):**\n    *   Apply **i-umlaut**, where the `/j/` in the `*-jan` suffix will mutate the preceding back-vowel `*ō` to `œ`.\n    *   Account for the phonological changes to the infinitive ending.\n4.  **PGmc to Old English (OE):**\n    *   Apply **i-umlaut**, where `/j/` mutates `*ō` to `ē`.\n    *   Apply **West-Germanic palatalization**, where `k` becomes `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/) before a front vowel or `/j/`.\n5.  **PGmc to Old High German (OHG):**\n    *   Apply the **High German Consonant Shift**, changing `k` to the fricative `hh` (pronounced /x/).\n    *   Apply **OHG diphthongization**, changing `*ō` to `uo`.\n    *   The `/j/` from the suffix is often dropped after causing i-umlaut, though the umlaut on `uo` is not always consistently written in the texts.\n\nI will now generate a Python script that carries out this plan and prints the results at each stage.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces a PIE word through its Germanic descendants based on linguistic sound laws.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

PIE to Proto-Germanic (*sōkijaną)\n    pgmc_explanation = \"\"\"\n    From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc), we see these key changes:\n    1. Laryngeal Coloring: The laryngeal 'h₂' colors the preceding 'e' to 'a'. Root becomes '*sag-'.\n    2. Vowel Shift: The resulting long vowel PIE *ā (from *eh₂) becomes PGmc *ō. Root is now '*sōk-'.\n    3. Grimm's Law: The voiced stop *g becomes a voiceless stop *k.\n    4. Suffix: The PIE suffix *-yeti becomes the PGmc Class 1 weak verb infinitive suffix *-janą.\n    \"\"\"\n    pgmc_form = \"*sōkijaną\"\n    pgmc_meaning = \"'to seek'\"\n    print(\"Stage 1: Proto-Germanic\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(pgmc_explanation).strip())\n    print(f\"Result in Proto-Germanic: *{pie_root} > {pgmc_form} ({pgmc_meaning})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 3. Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (sœkja)\n    on_explanation = \"\"\"\n    From PGmc to Old Norse (ON), the main change is i-umlaut:\n    1. i-Umlaut: The 'j' in the suffix *-janą palatalizes (fronts) the preceding back vowel *ō to œ.\n    2. Suffix Change: The PGmc infinitive ending evolves into the Old Norse '-a', and the 'j' is retained.\n    \"\"\"\n    on_form = \"sœkja\"\n    on_meaning = \"'to seek, visit, prosecute'\"\n    print(\"Stage 2: Old Norse\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(on_explanation).strip())\n    print(f\"Result in Old Norse: {pgmc_form} > {on_form} ({on_meaning})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 4. Proto-Germanic to Old English (sēcan)\n    oe_explanation = \"\"\"\n    From PGmc to Old English (OE), two crucial West Germanic changes occur:\n    1. i-Umlaut: Like in Norse, the 'j' mutates the root vowel, but in OE, *ō becomes ē.\n    2. Palatalization: The consonant *k is palatalized by the 'j' to ċ (pronounced /tʃ/, like 'ch' in 'church').\n    3. The 'j' is then lost and the ending becomes '-an'.\n    \"\"\"\n    oe_form = \"sēcan\"\n    oe_meaning = \"'to seek'\"\n    print(\"Stage 3: Old English\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(oe_explanation).strip())\n    print(f\"Result in Old English: {pgmc_form} > {oe_form} ({oe_meaning})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 5. Proto-Germanic to Old High German (suohhen)\n    ohg_explanation = \"\"\"\n    From PGmc to Old High German (OHG), the changes are distinct:\n    1. High German Consonant Shift: The voiceless stop *k shifts to a voiceless fricative, written 'hh' /x/.\n    2. Diphthongization: The long vowel *ō is broken into the diphthong 'uo'.\n    3. The suffix *-janą becomes '-en'. The 'j' causes an i-umlaut on 'uo' -> 'üe', but this was not always written.\n    \"\"\"\n    ohg_form = \"suohhen\"\n    ohg_meaning = \"'to seek, to visit'\"\n    print(\"Stage 4: Old High German\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(ohg_explanation).strip())\n    print(f\"Result in Old High German: {pgmc_form} > {ohg_form} ({ohg_meaning})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Final Summary\n    print(\"Summary of Etymological Development:\")\n    print(f\"PIE *seh₂gieti gives us:\")\n    print(f\"Proto-Germanic: {pgmc_form}\")\n    print(f\"Old Norse: {on_form}\")\n    print(f\"Old English: {oe_form}\")\n    print(f\"Old High German: {ohg_form}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    trace_etymology()\n```\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną, Old Norse: sœkja, Old English: sēcan, Old High German: suohhen>>>"
