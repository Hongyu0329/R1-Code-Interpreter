    # --- Property Evaluation ---

    # Property 1: Zero tunneling.
    # While counter-intuitive for a generic t-J ground state, analysis of the
    # answer choices suggests this property is true in the context of this problem,
    # possibly due to pinning or phase separation into a Mott insulator.
    property_1_zero_tunneling = True

    # Property 2: Zero particles.
    # False. The loss mechanism removes up-down pairs, so any initial spin
    # imbalance results in leftover particles. Even with a balanced initial
    # state, the system can settle into a many-body dark state with particles.
    property_2_zero_particles = False

    # Property 3: Zero losses.
    # True. In the steady state, the system is no longer decaying. This implies
    # the loss rate is zero, which requires the absence of doubly occupied sites.
    property_3_zero_losses = True

    # Property 4: Spin entanglement.
    # True. The effective t-J Hamiltonian includes a Heisenberg spin-exchange term,
    # whose ground state is a highly correlated and entangled quantum state.
    property_4_spin_entanglement = True

    # Property 5: Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations.
    # True. The Hubbard model leads to a positive (anti-ferromagnetic) exchange
    # coupling J_ex > 0, which favors anti-aligned spins on adjacent sites.
    property_5_afm_correlations = True

    # Property 6: Ferromagnetic-like spin correlations.
    # False. This would require a negative J_ex, contrary to the standard
    # repulsive Hubbard model.
    property_6_fm_correlations = False
