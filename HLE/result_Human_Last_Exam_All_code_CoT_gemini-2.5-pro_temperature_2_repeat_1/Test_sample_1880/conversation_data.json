    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for quartic polynomials.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion for this.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. A key test is whether $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic:** The reducibility of an associated cubic polynomial, the resolvent cubic, provides the next major clue to identify the group.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** We will check if the resolvent cubic has rational roots.\n5.  **Distinguish Final Cases:** Based on the properties of the discriminant and the roots of the resolvent cubic, we can distinguish between the remaining possible groups ($D_4$ or $C_4$) and determine the final order. The final test involves checking if the original polynomial becomes reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThis entire process can be scripted. The following Python code will perform these calculations, print out the values and equations used in each step, and determine the order of the Galois group.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # For the standard depressed quartic form x^4 + px^2 + qx + r,\n    # we have p=0, q=8, r=14.\n    p_coeff = 0\n    q_coeff = 8\n    r_coeff = 14\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n    print(\"The polynomial is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2, as p divides 14 and 8, but not 1, and p^2=4 does not divide 14.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of S4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial.\")\n    # For a depressed quartic x^4 + qx + r, the discriminant formula simplifies from\n    # Δ = 16p^4r - 4p^3q^2 - 128p^2r^2 + 144pq^2r - 27q^4 + 256r^3\n    # to Δ = -27q^4 + 256r^3, since p=0.\n    delta = -27 * (q_coeff**4) + 256 * (r_coeff**3)\n    \n    print(f\"Using coefficients q={q_coeff}, r={r_coeff} in the discriminant formula:\")\n    print(f\"Δ = -27 * ({q_coeff})^4 + 256 * ({r_coeff})^3\")\n    print(f\"Δ = -27 * {q_coeff**4} + 256 * {r_coeff**3}\")\n    print(f\"Δ = {-27 * (q_coeff**4)} + {256 * (r_coeff**3)}\")\n    print(f\"Δ = {delta}\")\n\n    sqrt_delta = int(math.sqrt(delta))\n    is_square = (sqrt_delta * sqrt_delta == delta)\n    print(f\"\\nThe discriminant Δ is not a perfect square in Q (sqrt({delta}) is irrational).\")\n    print(\"This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of A4.
