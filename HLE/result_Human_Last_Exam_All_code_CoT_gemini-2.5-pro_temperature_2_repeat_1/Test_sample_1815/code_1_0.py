    This function explains the reasoning and returns the final answer.

    The problem asks for the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers (Z)
    that have no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    1. A topological group G is totally bounded if and only if it is a (topological)
       subgroup of a compact group K. In our case, Z would be a dense subgroup of a
       compact group K. Since Z is infinite, K must be infinite.

    2. A group has "no nontrivial convergent sequences" if the only sequences that
       converge are those that are eventually constant.

    3. Let's assume such a topology T exists on Z. Then (Z, T) is a dense subgroup
       of an infinite compact group K.

    4. Let's consider an open neighborhood U of the identity element `e` in K.
       - If U contains only a finite number of integers, then we could find a smaller
         neighborhood V such that V intersects Z only at 0. This would make {0} an
         open set in the topology on Z.
       - If {0} is open in a topological group, the topology must be discrete (all points
         are open).
       - However, the integers with the discrete topology are not totally bounded.
         Consider the open set U = {0}. Any finite union of its translates, like
         {g_1, g_2, ..., g_n}, is a finite set and cannot cover the infinite set Z.
       - This is a contradiction. Therefore, every open neighborhood U of the identity `e`
         in K must contain infinitely many integers.

    5. Since every neighborhood of `e` contains infinitely many integers, we can construct
       a sequence of distinct non-zero integers (z_n) that converges to `e`. This
       would be a non-trivial convergent sequence in (Z, T).

    6. This contradicts the condition that there are no non-trivial convergent sequences.

    7. The two conditions—being totally bounded and having no non-trivial convergent
       sequences—are mutually exclusive for the infinite group of integers.

    Therefore, the number of such topologies is 0.
