    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Interpret the User's Request**: The user is asking for the continued fraction of a \"generalized Markov number\" denoted as $m_{4/7}$. This notation, while not universally standardized, is strongly associated with a specific construction in the field of Diophantine approximation and the study of the Markov and Lagrange spectra. The construction yields a quadratic irrational number whose continued fraction is periodic and derived from the continued fraction of the rational number in the subscript, in this case, 4/7.\n\n2.  **Compute the Continued Fraction of the Rational Number**: First, I will find the simple continued fraction of $r = 4/7$. For a rational number $p/q$ between 0 and 1, this takes the form $[0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$.\n\n3.  **Ensure Odd Length**: The standard construction requires the sequence of coefficients $(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$ to have an odd length. If the length $n$ is even, it's converted to an equivalent continued fraction with an odd number of coefficients by replacing the last coefficient $a_n$ with $(a_n-1)$ and appending a 1. For $4/7$, we will see if this step is necessary.\n\n4.  **Construct the Palindromic Part**: From the odd-length sequence of coefficients $A = (b_1, \\ldots, b_k)$, a new palindromic sequence $W$ is created. This palindrome is formed by taking the sequence $A$ and appending the reverse of $A$ with its last element removed. That is, $W = (b_1, \\ldots, b_k, b_{k-1}, \\ldots, b_1)$.\n\n5.  **Form the Final Period**: The periodic part of the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number is created by taking the palindromic sequence $W$ and appending the integer 2.\n\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that implements these steps. The script will take $p=4$ and $q=7$, perform the calculations, and print the final continued fraction in a clear, formatted equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the continued fraction of the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n\n    Args:\n        p (int): The numerator of the rational number.\n        q (int): The denominator of the rational number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if q <= 0 or p < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"p must be non-negative and q must be positive.\")\n    if p >= q:\n        raise ValueError(\"This construction is typically for rationals p/q in (0,1).\")\n\n    # Step 1: Get the continued fraction coefficients for p/q.\n    # The coefficients [a_1, a_2, ...] are for the fractional part.\n    temp_p, temp_q = p, q\n    coeffs = []\n    _ = temp_p // temp_q # a_0, which is 0 for p < q\n    temp_p, temp_q = temp_q, temp_p % temp_q\n    \n    while temp_q > 0:\n        a = temp_p // temp_q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        temp_p, temp_q = temp_q, temp_p % temp_q\n    \n    # Step 2: Ensure the length of the coefficient sequence is odd.\n    if len(coeffs) % 2 == 0:\n        last_coeff = coeffs.pop()\n        # This identity [..., a] = [..., a-1, 1] is used.\n        coeffs.append(last_coeff - 1)\n        coeffs.append(1)\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the palindromic sequence W.\n    # W = (a_1, ..., a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)\n    palindrome_part = coeffs[:-1]\n    palindrome_part.reverse()\n    W = coeffs + palindrome_part\n\n    # Step 4: Form the final period by appending 2.\n    period = W + [2]\n\n    # Step 5: Print the final result in the desired format.\n    print(f\"The continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{p}/{q} is constructed as follows:\")\n    print(f\"1.
