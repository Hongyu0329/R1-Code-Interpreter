    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the shape of the water's surface:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Icosahedron's Properties:** An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. It possesses a high degree of symmetry, including a center of inversion. This means for every point on its surface, there is an identical point on the opposite side through the center.\n\n2.  **Understand the Setup:** The tank is standing on one of its triangular faces, making this face the base. Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, there is another parallel triangular face at the very top.\n\n3.  **Interpret \"Half-Filled\":** When the tank is half-filled, the water occupies exactly half of the icosahedron's total volume.\n\n4.  **Apply the Symmetry Principle:** For any centrally symmetric object like an icosahedron, any plane passing through its center of symmetry divides the object into two equal volumes. Therefore, the water surface must be a flat plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n5.  **Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section:** The water surface is the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at its center. When an icosahedron is oriented with one face on the bottom and a parallel face on the top, the horizontal cross-section at its exact center (the \"equator\") is a **regular hexagon**.\n\nThe vertices of this hexagon are formed by the midpoints of the six edges that lie on the horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n```python\ndef explain_water_surface_shape():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and determines the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Description of the object and setup\n    object_name = \"Icosahedron\"\n    base_shape = \"equilateral triangle\"\n    fill_level = \"half-filled\"\n    \n    # Geometric Reasoning\n    reasoning_step_1 = \"An icosahedron is a centrally symmetric polyhedron.
