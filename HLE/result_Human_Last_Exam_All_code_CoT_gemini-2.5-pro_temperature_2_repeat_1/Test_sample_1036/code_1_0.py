# The problem asks for the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, 2, ..., 100)
# such that n gives different remainders when divided by each of k = 2, 3, ..., 100.
# As explained in the thinking process, the number of such integers is equal to the
# number of valid sequences of remainders (r_2, r_3, ..., r_{100}).

# We found that for each step in constructing the sequence of remainders,
# there are exactly two choices.
# The number of remainders to determine is from k=2 to k=100.
num_remainders = 100 - 2 + 1

# For each of the `num_remainders` steps, there are 2 choices.
num_choices_per_step = 2

# The total number of possibilities is `num_choices_per_step` raised to the power of `num_remainders`.
base = num_choices_per_step
exponent = num_remainders
result = base ** exponent

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The conceptual equation is: Total Solutions = (Choices per step) ^ (Number of steps)
