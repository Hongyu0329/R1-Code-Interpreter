    Solves the given Diophantine equation by factoring it and using known results from number theory.

    # The Diophantine equation can be factorized into:
    # (x^3 + y^3 - z^3) * (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4) = 0
    # As x, y, z, w are positive integers, one of the factors must be zero.
    
    # Case 1: x^3 + y^3 - z^3 = 0 (or x^3 + y^3 = z^3)
    # By Fermat's Last Theorem, this equation has no solution in positive integers.
    
    # Case 2: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4 = 0 (or x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4)
    # This equation has solutions. We need the one with the smallest max({x, y, z, w}).
    # The smallest known such solution (found by Roger Frye, 1988) is:
    # {x, y, z} = {95800, 217519, 414560} and w = 422481.
    
    # We are asked to find the sum x + y + z for this solution.
    # The assignment of values to x, y, and z can be any permutation of the set,
    # but the sum will be the same.
