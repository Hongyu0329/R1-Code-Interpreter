    "My plan is to identify the novel and author based on the two key pieces of information you provided: the specific quote from Jorge Luis Borges and his description of the author in relation to William Faulkner. I will use this information to determine the correct novel. Once identified, I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the novel and its author as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef print_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the novel and author\n    that Jorge Luis Borges praised with the given quote.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel_title = \"El astillero (The Shipyard)\"\n    author_name = \"Juan Carlos Onetti\"\n\n    print(\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to is:\")\n    print(f\"Title: {novel_title}\")\n    print(f\"Author: {author_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nBorges made these remarks in his prologue to the novel.\")\n\nprint_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<El astillero (The Shipyard)>>>"
