    "To determine the letter formed by the buildings of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa, we would need to analyze their shape from a top-down satellite view. Since running a real-time satellite image analysis is not feasible within a simple script, I will programmatically store and present the known information based on geographical data from mapping services.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Store the names of the two high schools in variables.\n2.  Store the letter that their combined building shapes form in another variable.\n3.  Print a sentence that clearly states the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the solution:\n```python\ndef find_building_shape():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the letter formed by the combined shape\n    of two high schools in Pisa when viewed from above.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two high schools located next to each other in Pisa\n    school_1 = \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\"\n    school_2 = \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\"\n\n    # The letter formed by the layout of their buildings\n    letter_shape = \"H\"\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"When viewed from above, the buildings of the high schools '{school_1}' and '{school_2}' stand next to each other, forming the letter:\")\n    print(letter_shape)\n\nfind_building_shape()\n```\n<<<H>>>"
