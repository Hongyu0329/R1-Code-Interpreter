# The problem asks for the threshold value of the parameter 'a' for an ellipsoid E(1, a)
# where the symplectic embedding capacity into a ball is determined solely by the volume constraint.
# This phenomenon occurs when a is greater than or equal to a specific value related to the golden ratio.
# The threshold value is tau^4, where tau is the golden ratio.

# Step 1: Calculate the terms needed for the golden ratio formula.
# The golden ratio tau is defined as (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
val_5 = 5
sqrt_5 = math.sqrt(val_5)
print(f"The equation requires the square root of 5.")
print(f"sqrt({val_5}) = {sqrt_5}")

# Step 2: Calculate the golden ratio, tau.
val_1 = 1
val_2 = 2
tau = (val_1 + sqrt_5) / val_2
print(f"\nNext, we calculate the golden ratio, tau.")
print(f"tau = ({val_1} + {sqrt_5}) / {val_2} = {tau}")

# Step 3: Calculate the final answer, a = tau^4.
power = 4
result = tau ** power
print(f"\nFinally, we calculate the value 'a' by raising tau to the power of 4.")
print(f"a = tau^{power} = {tau} ^ {power} = {result}")

print(f"\nThus, the value at which the volume constraint becomes the only obstruction is a = {result:.6f}")
