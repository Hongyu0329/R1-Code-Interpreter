    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. In our case, `x(t) = cos(9t)` can be written as `x(t) = sin(9t + π/2)`, so we have `a=9` and `b=5`.\n\n2.  **Check the properties of `a` and `b`:** The parameters are `a=9` and `b=5`.\n    *   They are integers.\n    *   They are coprime, as `gcd(9, 5) = 1`.\n    *   Both are odd numbers.\n    *   The phase difference `δ` is `π/2`.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:** For Lissajous curves of the form `x = cos(at)` and `y = sin(bt)` where `a` and `b` are coprime odd integers, there is a specific formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points. The curve does not pass through the origin since `cos(9t)` and `sin(5t)` cannot be zero for the same value of `t`. The number of self-intersection points `N` is given by:\n    N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute `a=9` and `b=5` into the formula.\n    N = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2\n    N = 8 * 4 / 2\n    N = 32 / 2\n    N = 16\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve\n    of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)) where a and b are odd coprime integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the curve equations x=cos(9t), y=sin(5t)\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # Check if a and b are coprime\n    if math.gcd(a, b) != 1:\n        print(\"The numbers a and b must be coprime.\")\n        return\n\n    # Check if a and b are odd\n    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:\n        print(\"The numbers a and b must be odd for this specific formula.\")\n        return\n    \n    print(\"The curve is a Lissajous curve defined by (cos(at), sin(bt)).\")\n    print(f\"For this curve, a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n    print(\"Since a and b are coprime odd integers, the number of self-intersections is given by the formula (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the number of self-intersections\n    intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Print the full equation and the result\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = ({a-1}) * ({b-1}) / 2 = { (a-1)*(b-1) } / 2 = {intersections}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of self-intersection points is {intersections}.\")\n\nsolve_lissajous_intersections()\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
