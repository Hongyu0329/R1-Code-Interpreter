    "In his political philosophy, particularly in his analysis of macrospheres, Peter Sloterdijk considers the modern State to be a metaphor for the **Leviathan**.\n\nHe draws heavily on Thomas Hobbes's concept of the Leviathan as an \"artificial man\" or a sovereign political body created to contain and protect its citizens from the chaos of the state of nature. For Sloterdijk, the Leviathan represents a monumental attempt to create a large-scale, self-enclosed, and immunologically secure container—a political macrosphere—that functions as an artificial environment for its population. It's a grand project of political \"air-conditioning\" and containment.\n\n<<<The Leviathan>>>"
