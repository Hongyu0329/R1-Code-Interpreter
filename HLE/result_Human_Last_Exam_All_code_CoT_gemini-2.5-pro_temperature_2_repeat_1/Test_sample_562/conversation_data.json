    "I will identify the radical (bushu) for the Japanese character 謄 and provide its name in Hepburn romanization.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the character:** The character 謄 can be broken down into two main components: a left part (hen) and a right part (tsukuri).\n2.  **Identify the radical:** The left part is 言. This is a common radical meaning \"speech\" or \"to say.\"\n3.  **Find the radical's name:** When the 言 radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏), and its specific name is \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n4.  **Create the script:** I will write a Python script to print this information and the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the Japanese character 謄\n    and prints its name in Hepburn romanization.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji = \"謄\"\n    radical_component = \"言\"\n    radical_name_hiragana = \"ごんべん\"\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n\n    print(f\"The Japanese character is: {kanji}\")\n    print(f\"The radical (bushu) is the left part: {radical_component}\")\n    print(f\"The name for this radical is {radical_name_hiragana}, which is transcribed as '{radical_name_hepburn}' in the Hepburn system.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{radical_name_hepburn}>>>\")\n\nfind_radical()\n```"
