    # Step 1: Calculate the thermal voltage (Vt)
    Vt = (k * T) / q

    # Step 2: Calculate the current I1 at voltage V1 using the Shockley diode equation.
    # This is the point where the behavior starts to change to linear.
    I1 = Io * (math.exp(V1 / (n * Vt)) - 1)

    # Step 3: Calculate the dynamic resistance (rd) in the specified linear region.
    # Since the region is linear, rd is the constant slope.
    rd = (V2 - V1) / (I2 - I1)
    abs_rd = abs(rd)

    # Step 4: Determine the target reflected load impedance (RL_prime) for startup.
    # For oscillation to start, RL_prime must be less than |rd|.
    # Applying the 20% margin: RL_prime = (1 - margin) * |rd|
    RL_prime = (1 - margin) * abs_rd

    # Step 5: Calculate the required impedance transformation ratio (N_squared).
    # This ratio transforms the external load RL to the target RL_prime.
    # RL_prime = RL / N_squared  =>  N_squared = RL / RL_prime
    impedance_ratio = RL / RL_prime
