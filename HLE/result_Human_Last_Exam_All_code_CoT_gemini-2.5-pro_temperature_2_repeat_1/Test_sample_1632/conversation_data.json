    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find the number of self-avoiding walks of exactly 10 steps on a 2D square grid (Manhattan lattice). A self-avoiding walk is a path that never visits the same point twice.\n\n2.  **Devise an Algorithm**: A direct calculation using a formula is not feasible as no simple formula exists. The best approach for a small number of steps like 10 is to use a backtracking algorithm to count all possible valid walks.\n\n3.  **Recursive Backtracking**:\n    *   I will write a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks(x, y, steps_left, visited_path)`.\n    *   This function will count the number of valid walks starting from the point `(x, y)` with `steps_left` steps remaining, given the `visited_path` so far.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when `steps_left` is 0, which means we've successfully found one complete walk. In this case, the function returns 1.\n    *   In the recursive step, the function will try to move to all four neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    *   For each neighbor, it checks if the point has already been visited.\n    *   If not visited, it adds the neighbor to the `visited_path` and makes a recursive call with `steps_left - 1`.\n    *   It adds the result of the recursive call to a running total.\n    *   After the recursive call returns, it removes the neighbor from `visited_path`. This is the \"backtracking\" step, which allows other paths to be explored.\n\n4.  **Use Symmetry**: All walks start at an origin point, say (0,0). The first step can be in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. By the symmetry of the grid, the number of valid 10-step walks starting with a step to the right is the same as the number starting with a step left, up, or down.\n    *   Therefore, I can calculate the number of walks that start by moving to one specific direction (e.g., right, to point (1,0)) and then multiply the result by 4 to get the total number of walks.\n    *   This means I'll calculate the number of 9-step self-avoiding walks starting from (1,0), with the constraint that the path cannot visit (0,0).\n\n5.  **Final Output**: The code will calculate the number of walks starting in one direction and then print the final equation showing the multiplication by 4 to get the total `a(10)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_walks_recursive(x, y, steps_left, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    A recursive function to count the number of self-avoiding walks.\n    - x, y: current coordinates of the walk.\n    - steps_left: number of steps remaining in the walk.\n    - visited: a set of (x,y) tuples representing the path so far.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: if there are no steps left, we have found one valid walk.\n    if steps_left == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    count = 0\n    # Explore neighbors: up, down, left, right\n    moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n\n        # If the neighbor has not been visited, we can move there.\n        if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n            # Add the new point to the visited set for the recursive call.\n            visited.add((next_x, next_y))\n            # Recursively count walks from the new point.\n            count += count_walks_recursive(next_x, next_y, steps_left - 1, visited)\n            # Backtrack: remove the point to explore other paths.\n            visited.remove((next_x, next_y))\n            \n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a \n    Manhattan lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    \n    print(f\"Let a(n) be the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\")\n    print(f\"To find a({n}), we assume the walk starts at (0,0).\")\n    print(f\"By symmetry, a({n}) is 4 times the number of walks that start by moving in one specific direction (e.g., to the right).\")\n\n    # A walk of n steps starting at (0,0) and moving right first\n    # is equivalent to an (n-1) step walk from (1,0) that avoids (0,0).\n    steps_remaining = n - 1\n    \n    # The path already contains the starting point (0,0) and the first step to (1,0).\n    start_point = (0, 0)\n    first_step_pos = (1, 0)\n    initial_visited = {start_point, first_step_pos}\n\n    # Calculate the number of walks for one initial direction.\n    walks_one_direction = count_walks_recursive(\n        first_step_pos[0], \n        first_step_pos[1], \n        steps_remaining, \n        initial_visited\n    )\n\n    # The total number of walks is 4 times this value.\n    total_walks = 4 * walks_one_direction\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of {n}-step walks starting with a move to the right is: {walks_one_direction}\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = 4 * {walks_one_direction} = {total_walks}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
