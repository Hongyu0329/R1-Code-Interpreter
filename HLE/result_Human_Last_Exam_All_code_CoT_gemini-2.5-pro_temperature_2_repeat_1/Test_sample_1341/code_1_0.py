    print("The critical point is whether Gary's text message qualifies as the 'written notice of default' required by the contract.")
    print("A text merely stating a payment was missed is not a formal declaration of default that initiates the legal repossession process.")
    print("Because a proper notice was not sent, the clock for the 3-day cure period never started.")
    print("Therefore, Gary's attempt to repossess the vehicle was premature and not in accordance with the contract terms.")
    print("\nThis aligns with choice C: The terms of the contract are enforceable, but Gary is not yet entitled to retake possession of the vehicle because sending a text mentioning that Jack missed a payment does not constitute written notice of default, as is required under the terms of the agreement.")
