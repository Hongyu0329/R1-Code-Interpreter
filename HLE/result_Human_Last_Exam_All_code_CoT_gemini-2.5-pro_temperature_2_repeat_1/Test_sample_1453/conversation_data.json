    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions 'a' and 'd' form the hydrophobic core that stabilizes the structure through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. We must first find the correct alignment (phasing) of this repeat onto the given sequence.\n2.  **Score Potential Phasings:** We will test all seven possible starting frames for the heptad repeat. A scoring system will be used to find the most plausible phasing, which typically places hydrophobic residues (like I, L, V, A, W) at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n3.  **Analyze the Core Residues:** Once the best phasing is identified, we will examine the specific amino acids that occupy the 'a' and 'd' core positions.\n4.  **Apply Packing Principles:** The identity and pattern of core residues determine the most stable oligomeric state. We will apply established principles:\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically stabilized by purely hydrophobic 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Often characterized by specific hydrophobic patterns (e.g., Isoleucine at 'd' and Leucine at 'a') or, crucially, by the presence of polar residues (like Serine, Asparagine) in the core. The trimeric structure can uniquely stabilize these polar residues by forming a hydrogen-bond network in the center of the complex.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Has its own packing preferences, but a polar core is less favorable than in a trimer.\n\nBy analyzing the core residues of the predicted best phasing, we can deduce the most likely oligomeric state. The Python code below automates this process.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_coiled_coil():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state based on\n    the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and core residue properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The protein sequence to be analyzed\n    sequence = \"GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing Coiled-Coil Sequence:\", sequence)\n    print(\"=\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 1: Find the most likely heptad repeat phasing.\n    # The 'a' and 'd' positions are critical.
