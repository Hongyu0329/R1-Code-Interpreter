    This script calculates the smallest natural number N with the property that,
    for every anisotropic quadratic form Q in N variables over a specific field K,
    the map defined by Q is surjective.

    The argument proceeds in steps:
    1. The number N is the u-invariant of the field K, u(K).
    2. The field K is a 2-dimensional local field of characteristic 2.
    3. The u-invariant of K is related to the u-invariant of its residue field k
       by the formula u(K) = 2 * u(k).
    4. The residue field k is a 1-dimensional local field of characteristic 2,
       and its u-invariant is known to be 4.
