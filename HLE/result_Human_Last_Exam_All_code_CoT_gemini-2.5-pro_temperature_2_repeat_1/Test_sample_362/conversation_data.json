    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:** I will first break down the IUPAC names of the two reactants provided to determine their chemical structures. The reactants are an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and a phosphonium ylide (a Wittig reagent).\n2.  **Apply the Wittig Reaction Mechanism:** The Wittig reaction is a well-defined organic reaction that forms an alkene. I will apply the known mechanism where the carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:** By combining the relevant parts of the two reactants, I will deduce the chemical structure of the main organic product.\n4.  **Name the Product:** I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the resulting alkene structure. This includes finding the longest carbon chain containing the new double bond, numbering the chain correctly, identifying all substituents, and determining the stereochemistry (E/Z) of the double bond, which is influenced by steric factors in this case.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints the full reaction equation, clearly stating the names of the reactants and products. The script will also provide a detailed explanation of the product's IUPAC name, highlighting the meaning of the numbers (locants) as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the product of a specific Wittig reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
