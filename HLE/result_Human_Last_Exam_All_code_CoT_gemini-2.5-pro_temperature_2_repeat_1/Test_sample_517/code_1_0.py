# The problem asks for the limit of the probability p_n as n approaches infinity.
# Based on the analysis of the underlying stochastic process (a conditioned random walk),
# we can derive the asymptotic behavior of p_n.
# The analysis, using a continuous approximation (a partial differential equation for the hitting probability),
# shows that p_n approaches 0 as n becomes large.
#
# The asymptotic formula for p_n is approximately:
# p_n ~ C * log(log(n)) / log(n)
# where C is a constant.
#
# As n -> infinity, log(n) grows much faster than log(log(n)),
# so the fraction log(log(n))/log(n) goes to 0.
#
# Therefore, the limit is 0.
# The code will simply print this final result.
