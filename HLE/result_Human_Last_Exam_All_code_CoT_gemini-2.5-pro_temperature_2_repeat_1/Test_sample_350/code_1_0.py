    # The question concerns Wolfhart Pannenberg's later work on cosmic history,
    # time, and physics.
    
    # Analysis of Influences:
    # 1. Georg (G.W.F.) Hegel: Pannenberg's entire project of "theology as history"
    # is a direct and critical engagement with Hegel's philosophy of history.
    # The idea that revelation is historical and universal is a Hegelian theme that
    # Pannenberg transforms.
    # 2. Friedrich Schelling: For his later turn to "cosmic history" and a theology
    # of nature that could engage with physics, Pannenberg drew significantly from
    # Schelling's later "positive philosophy," which dealt with themes of freedom,
    # contingency, and a history of nature itself as part of the divine life.
    
    # This combination of Hegel (for the structure of history as revelation) and
    # Schelling (for the inclusion of nature and contingency) is the correct answer.
