    "To determine the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume for squarefree natural numbers, we turn to the Minkowski bound from algebraic number theory. The code below will derive this relationship step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish the Context**: We are working with real quadratic number fields, which are of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ where $N$ is a squarefree natural number.\n2.  **Identify Key Parameters**: For any real quadratic field, we can determine its degree ($n$), number of real embeddings ($r_1$), and number of complex embeddings ($r_2$).\n3.  **Introduce the Covolume**: The covolume ($V$) of the lattice of integers is the square root of the absolute value of the field's discriminant, $V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n4.  **Apply Minkowski's Bound**: State the general formula for the Minkowski bound ($M$), which provides an upper limit for the norm of an ideal in every class of the ideal class group. The formula is $M \\leq (\\frac{4}{\\pi})^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n5.  **Derive the Specific Bound**: Substitute the parameters for a real quadratic field into the general formula to find the constant that relates the bound ($M$) to the covolume ($V$). The user's notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is understood to refer to this bound, M.\n\nThe Python script will now execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_minkowski_bound_relation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the upper bound for the norm of an ideal\n    in relation to the covolume for real quadratic number fields Q(sqrt(N)),\n    where N is a squarefree natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script determines the upper bound for the norm (denoted k_{k,∞}) in relation to the covolume (V).\")\n    print(\"The context is real quadratic fields K = Q(sqrt(N)) for a squarefree integer N > 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # 1.
