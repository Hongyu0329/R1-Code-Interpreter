    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of possible values for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface and $C^{(15)}$ is its 15th symmetric power.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Jacobian of C**: The rank of the Neron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve, denoted $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, is directly related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety, $J(C)$. For a curve $C$ of genus $g$ and a symmetric power $d \\ge g-1$, the following formula by MacDonald holds:\n    $$ \\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1 $$\n    In our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. Since $15 \\ge 3-1 = 2$, this formula applies. Therefore, our task is to find the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$ where $C$ is a genus 3 curve.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounds for ρ(J(C))**: The Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension $g$ (like $J(C)$) has a rank $\\rho$ that is bounded. For a Jacobian of a curve of genus $g$, the rank $\\rho(J(C))$ satisfies:\n    $$ 1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le g^2 $$\n    For our genus $g=3$ curve, this means:\n    $$ 1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9 $$\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Rank**: The smallest possible rank, $\\rho(J(C))=1$, is achieved for a \"generic\" curve. In this case, the Jacobian $J(C)$ has no complex multiplication, and its endomorphism ring is simply the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. The Neron-Severi group is then generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Such curves are abundant.\n    *   Minimum $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n    *   Smallest $\\rho(X) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Find the Largest Rank**: The largest possible rank, $\\rho(J(C))=g^2=9$, is achieved for very special curves whose Jacobians have maximal complex multiplication. These are Jacobians that are isogenous to a product of CM elliptic curves. For genus 3, the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$, is a well-known example. Its Jacobian has $\\rho(J(C))=9$.\n    *   Maximum $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n    *   Largest $\\rho(X) = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We will use a simple Python script to state these facts and compute the final values. The fact that we are considering the 15th symmetric power does not affect the ranks, as the formula holds for any $d \\ge 2$.\n\n```python\n# The genus of the Riemann surface C.\ng = 3\n\n# The symmetric power d.\nd = 15\n\nprint(\"The problem is to find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15),\")\nprint(f\"where C is a Riemann surface of genus g = {g}.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of C, rho(C^(d)), is given by the formula:\")\nprint(\"rho(C^(d)) = rho(J(C)) + 1\")\nprint(\"where J(C) is the Jacobian of C. This formula holds for d >= g-1.\\n\")\nprint(f\"In this case, g = {g} and d = {d}, so {d} >= {g-1}, and the formula applies.\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, rho(J(C)), for a curve of genus g={g} is bounded:\")\nprint(f\"1 <= rho(J(C)) <= g^2, which means 1 <= rho(J(C)) <= {g**2}.\\n\")\n\n# --- Smallest Rank ---\nmin_rho_JC = 1\nsmallest_rank = min_rho_JC + 1\nprint(\"1. Smallest Rank:\")\nprint(f\"This occurs for a generic curve C, where rho(J(C)) is minimal, i.e., rho(J(C)) = {min_rho_JC}.\")\nprint(\"The smallest possible rank of NS(X) is therefore:\")\nprint(f\"rho(J(C))_min + 1 = {min_rho_JC} + 1 = {smallest_rank}\\n\")\n\n# --- Largest Rank ---\nmax_rho_JC = g**2\nlargest_rank = max_rho_JC + 1\nprint(\"2. Largest Rank:\")\nprint(f\"This occurs for a special curve C (like the Fermat quartic), where rho(J(C)) is maximal, i.e., rho(J(C)) = g^2 = {max_rho_JC}.\")\nprint(\"The largest possible rank of NS(X) is therefore:\")\nprint(f\"rho(J(C))_max + 1 = {max_rho_JC} + 1 = {largest_rank}\\n\")\n\n```\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.\n<<<[2, 10]>>>"
