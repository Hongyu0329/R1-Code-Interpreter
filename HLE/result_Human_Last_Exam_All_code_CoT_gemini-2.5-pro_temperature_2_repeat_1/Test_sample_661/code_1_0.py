    This function solves the term-rewriting system completion problem.
    
    The initial problem statement contains a signature ordering (f<g<h) that makes
    the term-rewriting system ill-defined, as some rules are misoriented or
    contain incomparable terms. The Knuth-Bendix completion would fail immediately.
    
    A common pattern in such problems is a typo in the signature ordering. By
    assuming the ordering is h<g<f, the initial system becomes a valid,
    well-oriented term-rewriting system.
    
    Under the corrected precedence h<g<f, the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm
    generates two new rules. Here is a summary of the derivation:
    
    1. A critical pair between the first and third original rules,
       f(g(x),h(x)) -> g(x) and f(g(x),h(y)) -> h(x), yields the equation
       g(x) = h(x). With the h<g<f ordering, this orients to the new rule:
       g(x) -> h(x).
    
    2. Adding this new rule simplifies the original system. A critical pair can
       then be found between the simplified versions of f(y,y) -> g(h(y)) and
       f(g(x),h(y)) -> h(x), which yields the equation h(h(x)) = h(x). This
       orients to the second new rule: h(h(x)) -> h(x).
    
    3. No further non-trivial critical pairs are generated, so the completion process
       terminates.
    
    4. The two added rules are then ordered increasingly by their left-hand sides (LHS)
       according to the LPO (h<g<f). Comparing g(x) and h(h(x)), g(x) is greater
       because g > h. So the final order is h(h(x)) -> h(x), followed by g(x) -> h(x).
