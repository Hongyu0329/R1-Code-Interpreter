    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a set of points (x, y, z) from sets X, Y, and Z, respectively, that remain unchanged after being operated upon by the functions F, G, and H.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the function definitions. It appears there is a typo in the prompt, listing the function G twice with different signatures. I will assume you meant three distinct functions, F, G, and H, with the following signatures based on your request:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n*   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n\nBased on these, an FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z)` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `x = F(x, y, z)`\n2.  `y = G(y, x, y)` (Note that the element `y` is used as the first and third input to G).\n3.  `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\nThe general mathematical conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a fixed point come from fixed-point theory. A common set of conditions is that `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces and the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy a \"contractive mapping\" condition. In simple terms, this means that each time you apply the functions to a guess, the resulting new triplet is guaranteed to be closer to the actual fixed point. If the functions are contractive, iteratively applying them will always converge to the unique fixed point.\n\nInstead of a formal mathematical proof, I will provide a Python script that demonstrates these conditions. I will define three simple functions `F`, `G`, and `H` that are known to have a fixed point. Then, I will use an iterative method, starting from a random guess `(0, 0, 0)`, to find the fixed point. The code will then verify that the found point satisfies the three defining equations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef F(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines the function F: X*Y*Z -> X.\n    This function is designed to have a fixed point for x at x=1, given y=2, z=3.\n    (1 + 2 + 3) / 6 = 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (x + y + z) / 6.0\n\ndef G(y, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines the function G: Y*X*Y -> Y.\n    Note that the signature is G(y,x,y).
