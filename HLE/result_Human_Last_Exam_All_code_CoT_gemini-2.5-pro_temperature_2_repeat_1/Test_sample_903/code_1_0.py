    # Step 1: Analyze the Ligand
    # The ligand is 1,3-Di[3-(2’-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene.
    # Let's break down the coordinating part: '[3-(2’-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]'
    # The molecule has two of these 'arms' attached to a benzene ring.
    # In each arm, the potential donor atoms are nitrogens.
    # - '2-pyridyl': Contains one nitrogen atom that is a strong donor.
    # - 'pyrazol-1-yl': This is a pyrazole ring attached at the N1 position. The N1 nitrogen is
    #   used for bonding to the rest of the molecule, but the N2 nitrogen has a lone pair
    #   available for coordination.
    # So, each arm provides 2 nitrogen donor atoms.

    # Step 2: Analyze the Metal Salt
    # The metal salt is ZnBr2.
    # This provides a Zn(II) center and two bromide (Br-) anions.
    # Bromide anions can act as ligands.
    salt_ligands = collections.Counter({"Br": 2})
    print(f"The salt ZnBr2 provides {salt_ligands['Br']} Bromide (Br) anions that can act as ligands.")
    
    # Step 3: Predict the Coordination
    # Zn(II) is a d^10 metal ion and commonly forms 6-coordinate octahedral complexes,
    # especially with large multidentate ligands.
    # We have a tetradentate (4-donor) N,N,N,N ligand and two monodentate Br- ligands.
    # These can combine to form a stable, neutral 6-coordinate complex.
    # Total Donors = (N donors from ligand) + (Br donors from salt)
    total_donors = ligand_donors + salt_ligands
    coordination_number = sum(total_donors.values())
