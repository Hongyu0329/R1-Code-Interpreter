    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  The problem is to find the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n2.  I will first establish that $X$ is simply-connected (i.e., $\\pi_1(X) = 0$) using the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n3.  For simply-connected spaces, a key result from rational homotopy theory states that the rank of the $k$-th homotopy group equals the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k$. Thus, we need to find $b_3(X)$.\n4.  Since $X$ is a smooth complex surface, it is a compact, orientable real 4-manifold. I will use Poincaré Duality, which states $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$, to relate $b_3(X)$ to $b_1(X)$.\n5.  From step 2, we know that $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, which means $b_1(X) = 0$.\n6.  By combining these steps, I will deduce the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nI will now write a Python script to execute this plan and print the derivation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\n    The method involves relating the rank of the homotopy group to Betti numbers, which are then\n    determined using standard theorems from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"To find the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X), we will follow these steps:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Relate homotopy group rank to Betti numbers\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Relate Homotopy Group Rank to Betti Numbers ---\")\n    print(\"For any simply-connected topological space Y, a result from rational homotopy theory\")\n    print(\"states that the rank of its k-th homotopy group equals its k-th Betti number:\")\n    print(\"rank(pi_k(Y)) = b_k(Y).\")\n    print(\"We must first verify that our space X is simply-connected.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Show X is simply-connected using Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Show X is Simply-Connected ---\")\n    print(\"X is a smooth hypersurface in CP^3.
