# This code requires a SageMath environment to run, as it uses specific functions
# for algebraic geometry. You can execute it online using SageMathCell.

# Define the polynomial ring over the rational numbers
P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')

# Define the polynomial from the right-hand side of the curve's equation
f = x^6 + 4*x^5 + 6*x^4 + 2*x^3 + x^2 + 2*x + 1

# Create the hyperelliptic curve object
C = HyperellipticCurve(f)

# The conductor() method for a hyperelliptic curve computes the
# conductor of its Jacobian variety.
conductor_value = C.conductor()

# Print the computed conductor
print(conductor_value)
