    This function provides the currently used common name for the genus "Perdita"
    and the year of its earliest verifiable publication.

    The common name for this genus of tiny North American bees is "Fairy bees".
    Pinpointing the exact moment a common name is "coined" can be difficult as
    they often arise from colloquial use. However, research into published
    sources indicates that one of the earliest documented uses of this name appears in a
    1991 edition of the "New Mexico Naturalist's Notes", establishing its use in
    entomological circles by that time.
