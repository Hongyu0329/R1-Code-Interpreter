    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares:** An 8x8 chessboard has a perimeter. The number of squares on this perimeter can be calculated as the total number of squares minus the inner squares. An 8x8 board has 64 total squares and a 6x6 inner area, so there are `64 - 36 = 28` edge squares. Alternatively, it's `(8 * 4) - 4` (for the double-counted corners), which is `32 - 4 = 28`.\n\n2.  **Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge:** The goal is to place as many bishops as possible on these 28 squares without any bishop attacking another. This is a known variation of the N-Bishops problem. For an n x n board, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is `2n - 2`. For an 8x8 board, this is `2 * 8 - 2 = 14`. A simple way to achieve this is to place bishops on all 8 squares of one column (e.g., column 'a') and on the 6 non-conflicting squares of the opposite column (e.g., `h2` through `h7`).\n\n3.  **Calculate the squares without bishops:** Subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find how many are empty. This will be `28 - 14`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\n# The size of the chessboard\nn = 8\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of squares on the edge of the board.\n# The formula is 4 * n - 4, which accounts for the four corners being counted once.\ntotal_edge_squares = 4 * n - 4\n\n# Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares.\n# For an n x n board, the solution is 2 * n - 2.\nmax_bishops_on_edge = 2 * n - 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n# This is the difference between the total edge squares and the number of bishops placed.\nempty_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n# Print the final result, showing each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"Total number of edge squares on an {n}x{n} board: {total_edge_squares}\")\nprint(f\"Maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge: {max_bishops_on_edge}\")\nprint(\"Number of edge squares lacking bishops is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops_on_edge} = {empty_squares}\")\n\n```\n<<<14>>>"
