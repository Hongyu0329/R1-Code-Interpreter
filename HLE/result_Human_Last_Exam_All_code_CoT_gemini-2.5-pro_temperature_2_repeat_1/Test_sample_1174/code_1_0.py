# The scaling exponents as determined from physical principles.
n1 = 1      # S_B proportional to conductivity sigma
n2 = 1      # S_B proportional to temperature T
n3 = -2     # S_B proportional to 1/z^2
n4 = 0      # S_B constant at very low frequencies (no screening)
n5 = -2     # S_B proportional to omega^-2 in the thin-sheet screening regime
n6 = -1.5   # S_B proportional to omega^-3/2 in the thick-sheet (skin depth) regime

# The problem asks for the value of the expression sum(k * n_k) for k from 1 to 6.
# Let's write out the full equation.
