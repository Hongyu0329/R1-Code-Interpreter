    explanation = """
    When a laser with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), or a 'vortex beam', interacts with a thin target, it imparts a rotational motion to the plasma electrons. This process leads to two significant consequences for the generated proton beam:

    1. Generation of a Strong Axial Magnetic Field:
    The rotating electron current acts like a nano-solenoid, generating a powerful and stable magnetic field along the laser's propagation axis.

    2. Effects of the Magnetic Field on the Proton Beam:
    This induced magnetic field directly influences the accelerated protons.

    a) Collimation: The forward-moving protons experience a Lorentz force from the axial magnetic field. This force is directed radially inward, pinching the proton beam and counteracting its natural divergence. This results in a more collimated beam.

    b) Energy Increase: The magnetic field confines the hot electrons that create the accelerating sheath field. By trapping these electrons near the axis, the density and duration of the sheath field are enhanced. A stronger, longer-lasting accelerating field transfers more energy to the protons, thus increasing the maximum proton energy.

    Conclusion: The net effect is that the proton beam becomes both more collimated and more energetic.
