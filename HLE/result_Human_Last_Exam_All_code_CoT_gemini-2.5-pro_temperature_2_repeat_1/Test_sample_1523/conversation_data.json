    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to determine the inner product, followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Point:** The foundation of finite-temperature field theory is the partition function `Z`, which is expressed as a functional integral over the field `ϕ`. This integral is weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action, `exp(-S_E[ϕ])`.\n2.  **Define the Euclidean Action:** For a neutral scalar field `ϕ` with mass `m`, the Euclidean action `S_E` in a 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime `(τ, **x**)` is given by:\n    `S_E[ϕ] = ∫ d⁴x_E [ ½(∂_μ ϕ)² + ½m²ϕ² ]`\n    At a finite temperature `T`, the imaginary time dimension `τ` is compactified, meaning the integral `∫ dτ` runs from `0` to `β = 1/T`.\n3.  **Rewrite the Action:** The goal is to express the action in a quadratic form, `S_E = ½(ϕ, Dϕ)`. This form helps in evaluating the functional integral and defines the propagator of the field. The inner product is defined as `(f, g) = ∫ d⁴x_E f(x)g(x)`.\n4.  **Derive the Operator D:** By applying integration by parts to the kinetic term `(∂_μ ϕ)²` and assuming boundary terms vanish (due to the periodicity of `ϕ` in imaginary time), we can find the explicit form of the operator `D`.\n    *   `∫(∂_μ ϕ)² d⁴x_E = ∫(∂_μ ϕ)(∂_μ ϕ) d⁴x_E = -∫ϕ (∂_μ∂_μ) ϕ d⁴x_E = -∫ϕ □_E ϕ d⁴x_E`\n    *   Here, `□_E = ∂_μ∂_μ = ∂_τ² + ∇²` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.\n5.  **Assemble the Inner Product:** Substituting this back into the action gives:\n    `S_E = ½ ∫ d⁴x_E [ -ϕ(□_E ϕ) + m²ϕ² ] = ½ ∫ d⁴x_E ϕ(x) [-□_E + m²] ϕ(x)`\n    From this, we can directly identify the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)` where the operator `D` is `(-□_E + m²)`.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that prints this resulting mathematical expression in a clear format, explicitly stating the numerical coefficients involved in the operator `D`, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs and prints the mathematical expression for the\n    inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature.\n    It explicitly details the numerical coefficients as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the various mathematical components as strings\n    inner_product_symbol = \"(ϕ, D_ϕ)\"\n    integral = \"∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x\"\n    field = \"ϕ(τ, x)\"\n\n    # Define the terms of the operator D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\n    op_term1 = \"∂_τ²\"\n    op_term2 = \"∇²\"\n    op_term3 = \"m²\"\n\n    # Define the numerical coefficients for each term in the operator\n    coeff1 = -1\n    coeff2 = -1\n    coeff3 = 1\n\n    # Construct the full expression string\n    final_equation = (f\"{inner_product_symbol} = {integral} {field} * \"\n                      f\"[ ({coeff1})*{op_term1} + ({coeff2})*{op_term2} + ({coeff3})*{op_term3} ] \"\n                      f\"* {field}\")\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(\"In the functional integral representation for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) that appears in the quadratic part of the action is:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(\"\\nThis expression shows the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the result of the kinetic operator D acting on ϕ.\")\n\n    # Explicitly print each number in the equation as requested\n    print(\"\\nThe numerical coefficients in the operator D are:\")\n    print(f\"1.
