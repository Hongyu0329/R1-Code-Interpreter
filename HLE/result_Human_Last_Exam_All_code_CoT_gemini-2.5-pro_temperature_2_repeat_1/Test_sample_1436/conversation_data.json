    "Of course. Here is a Python script to calculate the symmetry factor for the described Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagram's Components:** The Feynman diagram in question has two vertices and four lines (propagators) connecting them. This topology is sometimes referred to as a \"setting-sun\" diagram if it's part of a larger diagram.\n\n2.  **Recall the Rule for Symmetry Factors:** The symmetry factor, `S`, of a Feynman diagram is the number of transformations (permutations of its vertices and internal lines) that leave the diagram unchanged. It's calculated by considering the different types of symmetries present.\n\n3.  **Calculate Symmetry from Vertices:** The two vertices are identical (as they come from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian, e.g., `λφ⁴`). Interchanging these two vertices leaves the diagram's overall structure the same. The number of such permutations is `2!`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Symmetry from Lines:** The four lines connecting the two vertices are also identical (representing the same type of field propagator). They can be permuted among themselves in any order without changing the diagram. The number of permutations for these four lines is `4!`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Factors:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the symmetries from permuting the identical vertices and the identical lines.\n\n    *   S = (Number of vertex permutations) × (Number of line permutations)\n    *   S = 2! × 4!\n\n6.  **Code the Calculation:** I will write a Python script that calculates these factorial values, multiplies them, and prints the final equation and result, clearly showing each component.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four identical lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The diagram has two identical vertices.
