    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   A **nondegenerate continuum** has more than one point.\n    *   The **composants** of a continuum are equivalence classes of points, where two points are in the same class if they are contained in some proper subcontinuum. Composants partition the space.\n    *   The **product** of two continua, X and Y, is the space X × Y.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of composants a single continuum can have:**\n    *   A continuum can be **decomposable** (the union of two proper subcontinua). In this case, it has exactly **1** composant (the entire space itself). An example is a closed interval `[0, 1]`.\n    *   A continuum can be **indecomposable** (not the union of two proper subcontinua). In this case, it has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$, an uncountably infinite number) of composants. An example is the pseudo-arc or a solenoid.\n\n3.  **Relate the composants of the product to the factors:**\n    *   A known theorem in topology states that the composants of the product space `X × Y` are precisely the sets `K_x × K_y`, where `K_x` is a composant of `X` and `K_y` is a composant of `Y`.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of composants in `X × Y` is the product of the number of composants in `X` and the number of composants in `Y`.\n\n4.  **Maximize the result:**\n    *   To find the *largest possible number* of composants in the product `X × Y`, we must maximize the number of composants for both `X` and `Y`.\n    *   This is achieved by choosing both `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate *indecomposable* continua.\n    *   In this case, `X` has **c** composants and `Y` has **c** composants.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final number:**\n    *   The total number of composants is `c * c`.\n    *   By the laws of cardinal arithmetic, `c * c = c`.\n    *   Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is **c**.\n\n6.  **Create a Python script:**\n    *   The script will not compute this mathematically but will use strings to represent the concepts and print the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the final answer, fulfilling the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the largest possible number of composants\n    of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let 'c' be the symbol for the cardinality of the continuum, an uncountable infinity.\n    c = 'c'\n    \n    # The number of composants of a continuum X, denoted |C(X)|, can be:\n    # 1) 1, if X is decomposable (e.g., an interval [0,1]).\n    # 2) c, if X is indecomposable (e.g., the pseudo-arc).\n    \n    # To maximize the number of composants in the product space X x Y,\n    # we must maximize the number of composants for both X and Y.\n    # This is achieved by choosing both to be indecomposable continua.\n    \n    max_composants_X = c\n    max_composants_Y = c\n    \n    # The number of composants of the product X x Y is the product of the number\n    # of composants of X and the number of composants of Y.\n    # |C(X x Y)| = |C(X)| * |C(Y)|\n    \n    # By the laws of cardinal arithmetic, the product of c with itself is still c.\n    # c * c = c\n    \n    result = c\n\n    # Output the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"Let c represent the cardinality of the continuum.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of composants for the first continuum is: {max_composants_X}\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of composants for the second continuum is: {max_composants_Y}\")\n    print(f\"The calculation for the product space is: {max_composants_X} * {max_composants_Y} = {result}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is c.\")\n\nsolve_composants_problem()\n```\n<<<c>>>"
