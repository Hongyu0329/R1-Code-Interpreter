# The boundary condition is given by the equation:
# (2/3) * x1(1/2) - (1/3) * x2(1/2) = 4

# Let's denote the value on the right-hand side
boundary_value = 4

# Let's define a new variable w(t) = 2*x1(t) - x2(t).
# From the boundary condition, we can determine the value of w(1/2).
# (2/3)*x1(1/2) - (1/3)*x2(1/2) = 4
# Multiplying the entire equation by 3 gives:
# 3 * [(2/3)*x1(1/2) - (1/3)*x2(1/2)] = 3 * 4
# 2*x1(1/2) - x2(1/2) = 12
# So, w(1/2) = 12.

# This value is derived directly from the problem's parameters and is independent
# of the initial conditions or the specific control function u(t).
# Given the ambiguity of the expression to be calculated, it's highly
# probable that the intended value is this constant.
