    "The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull of a great icosahedron.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  **Identify the outer-hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its \"outer-hull,\" more formally known as its convex hull, is the smallest convex shape that encloses it. The vertices of the great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the triangulation:** The problem is now reduced to finding the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the surface of a regular icosahedron.\n3.  **Count the faces:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles. This is inherently the most efficient and minimal triangulation of its surface.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The number of triangles is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** We can write a Python script to derive the number of faces (F) of an icosahedron from its number of vertices (V) and edges (E) using Euler's formula relationships. An icosahedron has 12 vertices, with 5 edges meeting at each vertex.\n\n```python\ndef solve_great_icosahedron_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of triangular faces on the convex hull of a great icosahedron.\n\n    The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.
