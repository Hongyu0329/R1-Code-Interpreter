    "The number of logical qubits, `k`, that can be encoded in a single planar patch of surface code with `h` holes (boundaries) is given by the formula `k = h - 1`.\n\nSince you have two separate patches, and each patch has two holes, we can calculate the total number of logical qubits by first finding the qubits per patch and then multiplying by the number of patches.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation and show the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of distinct surface code patches\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes in each patch\nnum_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n# The formula for logical qubits (k) in a single planar patch is k = h - 1,\n# where h is the number of holes (or boundaries).\nqubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch - 1\n\n# Total number of logical qubits is the sum of qubits from each patch.\ntotal_logical_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\nprint(f\"For one patch with {num_holes_per_patch} holes, the number of logical qubits is {num_holes_per_patch} - 1 = {qubits_per_patch}.\")\nprint(f\"For {num_patches} such patches, the total number of logical qubits is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{num_patches} * ({num_holes_per_patch} - 1) = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
