    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nMy plan is to first research the history of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" to identify a unique feature that was removed around the year 1950. After finding the correct historical fact, I will present the answer in a Python script that prints a descriptive text, as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the trivia question about the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature = \"The tramway lines\"\n    removal_year = 1950\n    explanation = (\n        f\"Until around {removal_year}, {feature.lower()} ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, \"\n        \"passing in front of the Pantheon. These tracks and their overhead power lines were a \"\n        \"defining feature of the square's modern landscape for decades. They were removed as \"\n        \"part of a city-wide effort to update transportation and reduce the visual impact of \"\n        \"modern infrastructure on ancient monuments.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(\"The unique feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda around 1950 was:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<The tramway lines>>>"
