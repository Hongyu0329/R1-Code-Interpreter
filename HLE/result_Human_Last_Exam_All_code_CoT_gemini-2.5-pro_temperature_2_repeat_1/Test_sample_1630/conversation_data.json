    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Re-frame the question:** The problem asks for the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$. So, the task is to find the maximum number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the degree of the equation:** I will determine the degree of the polynomial $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Given that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both degree-3 polynomials, their composition $f(g(x))$ will be a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$. This means the fixed-point equation, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n3.  **Establish an upper bound:** According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. This sets an upper bound of 9 for the number of fixed points.\n\n4.  **Demonstrate achievability:** The main challenge is to show that 9 fixed points are actually achievable. I need to argue that it's possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions ($f' > 0, g' > 0$) and for which $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n    *   Let $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. For the 9th-degree polynomial $k(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative, $k'(x)$, must have 8 distinct real roots (by Rolle's Theorem).\n    *   I will analyze the derivative $k'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    *   I will determine the degree of $k'(x)$, which turns out to be 8.\n    *   An 8th-degree polynomial can indeed have 8 distinct real roots. I'll argue that this is possible under the given constraints on $f$ and $g$.\n    *   If $k'(x)$ has 8 roots, then $k(x)$ has 8 local extrema. Since $k(x)$ is a 9th-degree polynomial, it goes from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. By adjusting the constant term (which is possible without violating the derivative conditions), we can ensure the local maxima are positive and local minima are negative, which guarantees 9 roots.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that presents this entire line of reasoning in a clear, step-by-step format. The script will use `print` statements to output the explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_fixed_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the maximum number of fixed points\n    for the composition of two degree-3 polynomials with positive derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Introduction to the problem\n    print(\"Problem: Let f and g be polynomials of degree 3 such that f'(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0 for all x.\")\n    print(\"What is the maximum number of fixed points that f(g(x)) can have?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Formulating the fixed-point equation\n    print(\"Step 1: The fixed-point equation\")\n    print(\"A fixed point 'x' of a function h(x) is a value such that h(x) = x.\")\n    print(\"For our problem, h(x) = f(g(x)).
