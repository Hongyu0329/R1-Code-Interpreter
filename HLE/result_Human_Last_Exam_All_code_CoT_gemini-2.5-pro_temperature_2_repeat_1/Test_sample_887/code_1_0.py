# This script determines the effect of C-H bond excitation on the reaction of CHD3 with fluorine.
# Based on the principles of mode-specific chemistry, exciting the C-H bond with a laser
# deposits energy directly into that bond. This has two main effects:
# 1. Acceleration: The overall reaction rate increases because the C-H bond is primed to react.
# 2. Selectivity: The pathway for H-atom abstraction is significantly favored over D-atom abstraction.
# Option D accurately describes both of these outcomes.

correct_answer = 'D'

# The final answer is printed in the required format.
