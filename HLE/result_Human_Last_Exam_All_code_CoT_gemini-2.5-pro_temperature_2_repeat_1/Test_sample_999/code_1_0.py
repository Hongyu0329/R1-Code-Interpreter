    Analyzes the provided statements about neural network quantization and identifies the incorrect one.

    Statement A: Correct. Mixed-precision is a common and effective technique.
    Statement B: Correct. Per-token activation and per-channel weight quantization is a standard high-performance implementation for using INT8 Tensor Cores.
    Statement C: Correct. INT4 quantization can provide significant speed-ups on modern GPUs like A100 and H100, which have hardware support for it.
    Statement D: Incorrect. Non-uniform quantization requires a dequantization step (e.g., table lookup) that adds significant overhead and prevents the direct use of hardware optimized for uniform integer arithmetic (like INT8 Tensor Cores). This makes it highly unlikely to achieve a "substantial" speed-up over the highly optimized native FP16 Tensor Core performance on Ampere GPUs. The primary benefit is model size compression, not speed.
    Statement E: Correct. Quantization is not limited to integers. Low-precision floating-point formats like FP8 and NF4 are also used.
