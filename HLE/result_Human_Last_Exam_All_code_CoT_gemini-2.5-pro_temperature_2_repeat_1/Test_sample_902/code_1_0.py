    print("1. The Halting Problem:")
    print("The pseudo-code for `def_superfast(10000)` requires the program to 'Consider all python programs with source code less than 10000 symbols that return an integer.'")
    print("To fulfill this requirement, a program would need to analyze any given piece of code and determine if it halts and successfully returns an integer value. This is a famous undecidable problem in computer science known as the Halting Problem.")
    print("Alan Turing proved that no general algorithm can solve the Halting Problem. Since implementing `def_superfast` requires solving it, the function is uncomputable, and no program can be written to compute it.\n")

    print("2. Proof by Contradiction (The Berry Paradox):")
    print("Let's assume for a moment that such a program, P, could exist. For this argument, let's also assume its source code is shorter than 10,000 characters.")
    
    print("\nLet S be the integer value that program P computes. So, S = def_superfast(10000).")
    print("By the function's definition, S = Huge_int + 1, where Huge_int is the largest integer output from any program shorter than 10000 characters.")
    
    print("\nHowever, since our hypothetical program P is itself shorter than 10000 characters and returns the integer S, its output (S) must be included when determining Huge_int.")
    print("This means that S must be less than or equal to the maximum value, Huge_int. So, we must have: S <= Huge_int.")
    
    print("\nThis leads to a direct logical contradiction. We have two conflicting statements derived from our initial assumption:")
    print("  a) S = Huge_int + 1")
    print("  b) S <= Huge_int")
    
    print("\nSubstituting the first statement into the second one gives us the final equation:")
    final_equation = "Huge_int + 1 <= Huge_int"
    print(f"  {final_equation}")
    
    # The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation!".
    # The number in our final paradoxical equation is 1.
    number_in_equation = 1
    print(f"\nThis inequality, Huge_int + {number_in_equation} <= Huge_int, simplifies to 1 <= 0, which is logically false.")
    
    print("\nThis contradiction proves that our initial assumption was wrong. No such program P can exist.")
