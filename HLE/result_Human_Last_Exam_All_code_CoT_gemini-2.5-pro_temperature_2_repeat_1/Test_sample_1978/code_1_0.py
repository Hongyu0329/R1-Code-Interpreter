# Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system (n).
# The matrix A is 202000x202000, which means we have a system of n ODEs.
n = 202000

# Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).
# The given conditions are:
# 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0
# 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0
# 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0
# 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0
# 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0
# 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0

# Conditions 3, 4, and 5 are linearly dependent on condition 2.
# This leaves us with three independent conditions: one for x_1, one for x_2,
# and one for x_2024.
k = 3

# Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem.
# The index of a linear BVP is defined as n - k.
index = n - k

# Print the final result, showing each number in the equation.
print(f"The index of the problem is the dimension of the system (n) minus the number of independent boundary conditions (k).")
print(f"Index = n - k")
print(f"Index = {n} - {k}")
print(f"The calculated index is: {index}")

# The final answer in the required format.
print(f"\n<<<{index}>>>")
