    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Determine the Dimension of the System (n)**: The boundary-value problem is based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The dimension of this system, `n`, is the number of individual equations. This is determined by the size of the matrix `A` and the vectors `x(t)` and `I(t)`. Based on the problem description, `A` is a 202000x202000 matrix, so the system consists of `n = 202000` equations.\n\n2.  **Count the Linearly Independent Boundary Conditions (k)**: The problem provides several boundary conditions. Some of these might be redundant (linearly dependent). I will analyze them to find the number of unique, independent conditions, which we'll call `k`.\n    The given conditions are:\n    *   `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`\n    *   `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n    *   `5x₂(T) - 5x₂(0) = 0`  (This is 5 times the previous condition)\n    *   `100x₂(T) - 100x₂(0) = 0` (This is 100 times the second condition)\n    *   `1000x₂(0) - 1000x₂(T) = 0` (This is -1000 times the second condition)\n    *   `100x₂₀₂₄(T) - 100x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0` (This simplifies to `x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`)\n\n    As we can see, the four conditions on `x₂(t)` are all scalar multiples of each other. Thus, they represent only one independent condition. The conditions on `x₁(t)`, `x₂(t)`, and `x₂₀₂₄(t)` involve different state variables, so they are independent of each other. This gives a total of `k = 3` independent boundary conditions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Index**: The index of a linear boundary-value problem is defined as the dimension of the system minus the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    *   Index = `n - k`\n\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a simple Python script to perform this calculation and print the result clearly, showing each number involved in the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system (n).\n# The matrix A is 202000x202000, which means we have a system of n ODEs.\nn = 202000\n\n# Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).\n# The given conditions are:\n# 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n# 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n# 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0\n# 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0\n# 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0\n# 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0\n\n# Conditions 3, 4, and 5 are linearly dependent on condition 2.\n# This leaves us with three independent conditions: one for x_1, one for x_2,\n# and one for x_2024.\nk = 3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem.\n# The index of a linear BVP is defined as n - k.\nindex = n - k\n\n# Print the final result, showing each number in the equation.\nprint(f\"The index of the problem is the dimension of the system (n) minus the number of independent boundary conditions (k).\")\nprint(f\"Index = n - k\")\nprint(f\"Index = {n} - {k}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated index is: {index}\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format.\nprint(f\"\\n<<<{index}>>>\")\n```"
