    Analyzes the convergence rate for stochastic logistic regression.
    
    The problem asks for the optimal rate of convergence for stochastic logistic regression
    in the regime T = O(exp(D)), where D is the norm bound on the parameter vector w.
    
    1.  The loss function is L(w) = E[log(1 + exp(x^T w))], which is convex and smooth.
    2.  In the general case (including adversarial, separable data distributions), the loss function is not strongly convex,
        and the minimum can be "flat". The minimax rate is generally Theta(D/sqrt(T)).
        In the regime T = O(exp(D)), we have D = Theta(log(T)). The rate would be Theta(log(T)/sqrt(T)).
        This is not one of the options A, B, C.
    
    3.  Under common regularity assumptions (non-separable data), the loss function has a
        non-degenerate minimum, meaning the Hessian at the optimum is positive definite. This
        is a form of local strong convexity.
    
    4.  For smooth convex optimization problems with a non-degenerate minimum, the optimal
        rate of convergence for stochastic algorithms is known to be Theta(1/T^(2/3)). This result
        improves upon the general Theta(1/sqrt(T)) rate by exploiting the local quadratic structure
        of the loss function near the optimum.
        
    5. The condition T = O(exp(D)) ensures that D can be made arbitrarily large, meaning for any
       non-separable problem with a finite optimum w*, the constraint ||w|| <= D is not active for large enough T.
       Thus, the rate is determined by the properties of the unconstrained minimum.
       
    Therefore, assuming the question refers to the regular, non-pathological setting, the optimal rate is Theta(1/T^(2/3)).
