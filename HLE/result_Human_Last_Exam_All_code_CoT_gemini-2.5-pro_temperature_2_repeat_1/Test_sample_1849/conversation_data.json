    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a core concept in the theory of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Here's a step-by-step explanation leading to the correct range for the rewards.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Value Iteration Algorithm:** We'll start by looking at the update rule for value iteration and the condition for its convergence.\n2.  **Role of the Reward Function:** We will analyze how the reward function `R` influences the convergence property. The key is to understand the difference between the rate of convergence and the convergence to a finite value.\n3.  **Identify the Necessary Condition:** Based on the analysis, we will determine the fundamental property the reward range must have to guarantee convergence.\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:** We will check each given option against this necessary condition.\n5.  **Demonstrate with Code:** A Python script will be provided to demonstrate the convergence for a valid reward range and the failure to converge for an invalid one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Value Iteration and Convergence:** The value iteration algorithm iteratively applies the Bellman optimality operator `T` to an estimate of the value function `V`:\n    `V_{k+1}(s) = (TV_k)(s) = max_a Σ_{s'} P(s' | s, a) [R(s, a, s') + γ V_k(s')]`\n    The algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the operator `T` is a **contraction mapping** on a complete metric space. With the max-norm `||.||_∞`, we can show that for any two value functions `U` and `V`:\n    `||T(U) - T(V)||_∞ ≤ γ ||U - V||_∞`\n    Since the discount factor `γ` is strictly between 0 and 1 (i.e., `0 ≤ γ < 1`), `T` is a contraction. The proof for this inequality involves the reward terms `R` canceling out, which means the **rate** of convergence (which is `γ`) is independent of the rewards.\n\n2.  **The Role of Rewards and Boundedness:** While the rate isn't affected by rewards, the convergence proof (via the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem) has another requirement: the operator `T` must map the space of value functions to itself. We typically work in the space of **bounded functions**. If `V` is a bounded function, for `T(V)` to also be bounded, the reward function `R` must also be **bounded**. If the rewards were unbounded, it's possible to construct MDPs where the optimal value function `V*` is infinite. In such cases, the value iteration sequence `V_k` would diverge to infinity, so the algorithm would not converge to a finite solution.\n\n3.  **The Necessary Condition:** Therefore, the key condition on the rewards to guarantee geometric convergence to a well-defined (i.e., finite) optimal value function is that the **reward function must be bounded**. This means there must exist some finite number `R_max` such that `|R(s, a, s')| ≤ R_max` for all states and actions.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A. `[-1, 1]`: This is a bounded range. Convergence is guaranteed.\n    *   B. `(0, 1)`: This is a bounded range. Convergence is guaranteed.\n    *   C. `(-1, 1)`: This is a bounded range. Convergence is guaranteed.\n    *   D. `[0, 1]`: This is a bounded range. Convergence is guaranteed.\n    *   E. `ℝ` (the set of all real numbers): This range is unbounded. It does *not* guarantee convergence.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The fundamental requirement is that rewards must be bounded. Options A, B, C, and D all describe bounded ranges and are therefore all sufficient to guarantee convergence. Since the question asks for *the* range, we should choose the one that is most representative or general. In many contexts, rewards are normalized to lie within `[-1, 1]`, which allows for both positive rewards and negative costs/penalties. This makes it a standard and general choice among the valid options.\n\n### Demonstration Code:\nThe following Python script demonstrates this principle. It runs value iteration for a simple MDP. First, it uses bounded rewards and shows convergence. Second, it uses an unbounded reward (`infinity`) and shows that the values diverge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef value_iteration_demo(R, gamma=0.9, T=None, max_iterations=100, tolerance=1e-4):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates value iteration on a simple 2-state, 2-action MDP.\n\n    Args:\n        R (np.array): Reward matrix of shape (actions, states).\n        gamma (float): Discount factor.\n        T (np.array, optional): Transition matrix of shape (actions, start_states, end_states).\n        max_iterations (int): Maximum number of iterations.\n        tolerance (float): Convergence threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    if T is None:\n        # T[action, start_state, end_state]\n        # Action 0: tend to stay, Action 1: tend to move\n        T = np.array([\n            [[0.9, 0.1], [0.1, 0.9]],  # Action 0\n            [[0.1, 0.9], [0.9, 0.1]]   # Action 1\n        ])\n\n    num_states = T.shape[1]\n    V = np.zeros(num_states)\n    \n    print(f\"--- Running Value Iteration ---\")\n    print(f\"Rewards R[action, state]:\\n{R}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n\n    for i in range(max_iterations):\n        V_old = V.copy()\n        \n        # Calculate Q-values: Q(s,a) = R(s,a) + gamma * Sum[P(s'|s,a) * V_old(s')]\n        # Using numpy broadcasting and einsum for efficiency\n        Q = R + gamma * np.einsum('ijk,k->ij', T, V_old)\n        \n        # Update value function: V(s) = max_a Q(s,a)\n        V = np.max(Q, axis=0)\n        \n        # Check for convergence\n        delta = np.max(np.abs(V - V_old))\n        print(f\"Iteration {i+1:3}: V = {np.array2string(V, precision=4, sign=' ')}, Delta = {delta:.6f}\")\n        \n        # Stop if converged or if values explode\n        if np.isinf(V).any():\n            print(\"\\nValues have become infinite.
