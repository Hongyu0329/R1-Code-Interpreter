    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Understand Critical-Level Views:** In population ethics, critical-level views assess the value of a population by summing up the \"utility\" of each person, but only after subtracting a certain \"critical level\" (`c`). The total value of a population is `Sum(welfare - c)` for all individuals. A key feature is that if the critical level `c` is positive, then adding a person with positive welfare that is nonetheless *below* `c` will *decrease* the total value of the population.\n\n2.  **Understand the Non-Elitism Condition:** This condition states that for any population of \"elites\" (people with very high welfare), there exists some other population of people with low but positive welfare that is better. In essence, it says that a massive number of people with decent lives can outweigh a small number of people with fantastic lives. It prevents a small elite from being lexically dominant.\n\n3.  **Test Critical-Level Views against Non-Elitism:**\n    *   Let's create an \"elite\" population, A. Imagine it has one person with a very high welfare of 100.\n    *   Let's set a positive critical level, say `c = 10`.\n    *   The value of population A is `100 - 10 = 90`.\n    *   Now, according to Non-Elitism, we should be able to find a population B, consisting of many people with low but positive welfare, that has a value greater than 90.\n    *   Let's try to construct population B. Let's pick a welfare level that is positive but *below the critical level*, for example, welfare = 5.\n    *   The value contribution of each person in population B is `welfare - c`, which is `5 - 10 = -5`.\n    *   No matter how many people we add to population B, the total value will be `number_of_people * (-5)`. This will always be a negative number.\n    *   A negative value (like that of population B) can never be greater than the positive value of population A (90).\n    *   Therefore, we cannot find a population B that satisfies the condition. This means that critical-level views violate the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates this violation.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates how critical-level views in population ethics\n    violate the 'Non-Elitism' condition of Arrhenius's theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Setup ---\n    # 1.
