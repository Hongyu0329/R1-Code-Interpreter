# The question asks for the largest possible cardinality of an antichain of nonprincipal ultrafilters
# below a fixed nonprincipal ultrafilter V in a specific order (the Rudin-Keisler order restricted
# to non-decreasing finite-to-one functions).

# This is a known problem in set theory. The answer is not a specific integer like 2 or 42, but a
# cardinal number known as the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by 'c' or 2^{\aleph_0}.

# It's possible to construct a family of c pairwise incomparable non-decreasing functions.
# This family can then be used to generate an antichain of ultrafilters of size c below any
# given nonprincipal ultrafilter V.

# The number of all functions from N to N is 2^{\aleph_0}, so c is also an upper bound on the
# number of ultrafilters below V that can be generated, and thus on the size of any antichain.

# Therefore, the largest possible cardinality is c.

# Representing the continuum cardinality, often denoted as c or 2^aleph_0.
# Since we cannot compute an infinite number, we'll represent it symbolically.
# Given the example in the problem description, a symbolic character seems appropriate.
continuum_cardinality = "c"

# The "final equation" part of the prompt is unusual for this type of problem.
# There is no calculation to be performed to get this result.
# We will just print the final answer symbolically.
