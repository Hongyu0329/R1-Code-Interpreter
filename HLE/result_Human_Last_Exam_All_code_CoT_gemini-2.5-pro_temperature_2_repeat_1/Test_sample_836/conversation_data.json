    "Of course. Here is the explanation and the Python code to answer your question.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the function:** First, I will define the function in question. In the context of nuclear criticality, the \"generalized pair correlation function\" refers to the covariance of the neutron flux fluctuations, which we'll denote as $C(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$. This function describes how fluctuations in the neutron population at different points in space and time are related.\n2.  **Define the transform:** Next, I will define the \"space-time, double Fourier transform.\" This mathematical operation converts the correlation function from the space-time domain $(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$ to the wavevector-frequency domain $(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$.\n3.  **Present the result:** The result of this transform is a new function, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$. The python code will print the equation defining this function.\n4.  **Provide the name:** Finally, the code will state the common name for $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ used in the nuclear criticality and reactor noise analysis community.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef display_fourier_transform_identity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and displays the space-time, double Fourier transform of the\n    generalized pair correlation function and provides its common name in the\n    nuclear criticality community.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define mathematical symbols for clarity\n    S_kw = sympy.Symbol(\"S(k, w)\")\n    C_rtau = sympy.Symbol(\"C(r, tau)\")\n    i = sympy.I\n    k, r = sympy.symbols('k, r', real=True, vector=True)\n    w, tau = sympy.symbols('omega, tau', real=True)\n    \n    # Explain the concepts\n    print(\"The 'generalized pair correlation function' in nuclear systems is the covariance of the neutron flux.\")\n    print(\"Let's denote it as C(r, tau), where 'r' is the spatial separation and 'tau' is the time lag.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The space-time, double Fourier transform of this function is a new function, S(k, w).\")\n    print(\"Here, 'k' is the wavevector (the Fourier conjugate of space 'r') and 'w' (omega) is the angular frequency (the Fourier conjugate of time 'tau').\\n\")\n    \n    # Display the defining equation\n    print(\"The definitional equation for this transform is:\\n\")\n    \n    # Manually print the equation to fulfill the user request\n    # to output each 'number' (term) in the equation.\n    print(\"S(k, w)  =  Integral over all tau [ Integral over all r [ C(r, tau) * exp(-i * (k . r - w * tau)) ] d_r ] d_tau\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(\" S(k, w)  => The resulting function in the frequency domain.\")\n    print(\" Integral => A double integral, one over all space (r) and one over all time (tau).\")\n    print(\" C(r, tau)=> The generalized pair correlation function (covariance of neutron flux).\")\n    print(\" exp(...) => The complex exponential which forms the kernel of the Fourier transform.\")\n    print(\" i        => The imaginary unit.\")\n    print(\" k . r    => The dot product of the wavevector and the position vector.\")\n    print(\" w * tau  => The product of angular frequency and time lag.\\n\")\n\n    # State the final answer\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"This function, S(k, w), is most commonly called the:\")\n    print(\"\\033[1mNoise Spectral Density\\033[0m\")\n    print(\"Sometimes, it is also referred to more specifically as the Power Spectral Density (PSD)\")\n    print(\"or Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD) of the neutron noise.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_fourier_transform_identity()\n    print(\"\\n<<<Noise Spectral Density>>>\")\n\n```"
