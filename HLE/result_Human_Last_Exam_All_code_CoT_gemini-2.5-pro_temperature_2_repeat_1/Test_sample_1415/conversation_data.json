    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Form:** The integral is of the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`. The antiderivative of this form is `ln|f(x)|`. In this problem, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is given by `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This results in `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate the Function Values:**\n    *   First, we'll calculate `F₃(1)`.\n        *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n        *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n        *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n        *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   Next, we'll calculate `F₃(0)`.\n        *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n        *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n        *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n        *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Evaluate the Expression:** We will find the value `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`. Note that for `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive, so the absolute value `| |` can be removed.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We will then compute `10000 * V` and find the closest integer to this value.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the functions based on the problem description\ndef F0(x):\n    return x\n\ndef F1(x):\n    return math.sin(F0(x))\n\ndef F2(x):\n    return math.exp(F1(x))\n\ndef F3(x):\n    return math.log(1 + F2(x))\n\n# Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0)\nf3_at_1 = F3(1)\nf3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n# The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n# Let V be the value of the integral\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# The final result is the closest integer to 10000 * V\nresult = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(result)\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated numbers\nprint(f\"The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 is evaluated as ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"So the value of the integral V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0}) = {V}\")\nprint(f\"The required value is the closest integer to 10000 * V = {result}\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer: {closest_integer}\")\n\n# Output the final answer in the required format\n# This is for automated processing and should contain only the final integer.\n# The user wants this specific format at the end.\nprint(f'<<<{closest_integer}>>>')\n```"
