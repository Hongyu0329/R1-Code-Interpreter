    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u^*` in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, we need to analyze the renormalization group (RG) beta function.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function:** In `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` of the ϕ⁴ theory is given by `β(u) = -ϵu + b u²`, where `b` is a positive constant. The value of `b` depends on the normalization conventions, but a standard result gives `b=3`.\n2.  **Find the Fixed Points:** Fixed points `u^*` are values of the coupling where the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling does not change under a change of scale. We solve the equation `β(u^*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve the Equation:** The equation is `-ϵu^* + 3(u^*)² = 0`. This can be factored as `u^*(-ϵ + 3u^*) = 0`.\n4.  **Identify the Solutions:** There are two solutions:\n    *   `u^* = 0`: This is the trivial Gaussian fixed point.\n    *   `-ϵ + 3u^* = 0`: This gives the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, `u^* = ϵ/3`.\n5.  **Leading Order Expression:** The expression `u^* = ϵ/3` is the desired result to the leading order in `ϵ`.\n\nThe following Python script will print out this derivation and the final expression.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher\n    fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem setup\n    print(\"In phi^4 theory in d = 4 - ε dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the coupling u is:\")\n    # The numbers in this equation are 1 (implicit in εu), and 3.\n    print(\"β(u) = -1 * ε * u + 3 * u^2\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # The fixed-point condition\n    print(\"Fixed points u* are found by solving β(u*) = 0:\")\n    print(\"-ε*u* + 3*(u*)^2 = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nFactoring out u* gives:\")\n    print(\"u* * (-ε + 3*u*) = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n\n    # The solutions\n    print(\"This equation has two solutions:\")\n    print(\"1.
