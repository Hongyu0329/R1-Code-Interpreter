Yes, modifying the linker to make it more like PEG is a very sensible strategy and is highly likely to solve the precipitation problem by increasing the probe's water solubility. The computational analysis confirms that adding ethylene glycol units significantly decreases the molecule's hydrophobicity (cLogP value).
