    "Here is my thinking process to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** I need to identify a man based on three specific clues:\n    *   Kurt Vonnegut described him.\n    *   He \"looks like a porcupine.\" This most likely refers to wild, spiky hair.\n    *   His name is two words, and both words start with the same letter (alliteration).\n\n2.  **Initial Candidate (The Obvious Trap):** The most famous Vonnegut quote about a \"porcupine\" is from his novel *Slaughterhouse-Five*, where the narrator sees a picture of **Albert Einstein** and thinks he looks like a porcupine. However, while Albert Einstein fits the first two clues, he fails the third: \"Albert\" starts with 'A' and \"Einstein\" starts with 'E'. This means he cannot be the correct answer.\n\n3.  **Finding a Candidate that Fits All Clues:** I need to find a person with an alliterative name, a porcupine-like appearance, and a connection to Kurt Vonnegut.\n    *   **Alliteration + Appearance:** I searched for famous figures with alliterative names and distinctively spiky or bristly hair. German playwright and poet **Bertolt Brecht** is a perfect fit. His signature look included very short, bristly hair that stood straight up, strongly resembling a porcupine. His name, \"Bertolt Brecht,\" starts with 'B' for both words.\n    *   **The Vonnegut Connection:** The final step is to confirm the connection to Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut was a great admirer of Bertolt Brecht and was significantly influenced by his theatrical techniques, which he mentions in his own writing.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Bertolt Brecht perfectly satisfies all three conditions of the riddle: a strong connection to Kurt Vonnegut, an appearance that matches the \"porcupine\" description, and a two-word name that starts with the same letter.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print this name, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function solves the riddle by identifying the man described.\n\n  Clues:\n  1. Described by Kurt Vonnegut as looking like a porcupine.\n  2. Name is two words, both starting with the same letter.\n\n  The answer is Bertolt Brecht.\n  - He had short, bristly hair that looked like a porcupine's quills.\n  - His name is alliterative (B.B.).\n  - He was a major literary influence on Kurt Vonnegut.\n  \"\"\"\n  first_name = \"Bertolt\"\n  last_name = \"Brecht\"\n  print(f\"{first_name} {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Bertolt Brecht>>>"
