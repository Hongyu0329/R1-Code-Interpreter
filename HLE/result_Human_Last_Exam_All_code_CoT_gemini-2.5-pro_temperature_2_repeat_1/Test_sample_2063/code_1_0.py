# The problem is to find the limiting probability P(n) as n -> infinity.
# P(n) is the probability that for a random DNA sequence of length n with 8 bases (0-7),
# the condition (count of base x) mod 8 != x holds for all x from 0 to 7.

# As n -> infinity, the probability that the count of a specific base x, modulo 8,
# equals any particular value k is 1/8.
# P(count(x) mod 8 = k) -> 1/8 for k in {0, 1, ..., 7}.

# The probability of failure for a single base x is P(count(x) mod 8 = x), which is 1/8.
# The probability of success for a single base x is P(count(x) mod 8 != x), which is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.

# For the entire sequence to be successfully replicated, this must be true for all 8 bases.
# Assuming independence of these events in the limit, the total probability is (7/8)^8.

# Define the components of the final fraction
numerator_base = 7
denominator_base = 8
exponent = 8

# Calculate the full numerator and denominator
final_numerator = numerator_base**exponent
final_denominator = denominator_base**exponent

# Calculate the final probability
result = final_numerator / final_denominator

# Output the components of the equation and the final answer, as requested.
print("The final probability P(n) is the result of the equation: (A^C) / (B^C)")
