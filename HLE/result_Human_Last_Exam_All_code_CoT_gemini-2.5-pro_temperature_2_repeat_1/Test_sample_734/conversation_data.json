    "My plan is to answer the user's question about Christian theology. The user has requested the answer in the format of a Python script. I will identify the theologian who developed a specific terminology to describe alterations in the laws of nature concerning both the virgin birth and the Fall. The most fitting theologian is Augustine of Hippo, who used concepts like \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*) and the \"course of nature\" (*cursus naturae*) to explain how God can act in ways that are unusual (like the virgin birth) without contradicting the deeper order He created, and how that order was itself altered by the Fall. I will create a Python script that stores this name in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n  # This function identifies the theologian based on the described concepts.\n  # The key concepts are:\n  # 1. Specialized terminology for changes in natural law.\n  # 2. Application to the virgin birth (a miracle).\n  # 3. Application to the Fall (an alteration of the state of nature).\n  # Augustine of Hippo developed the concepts of \"seminal reasons\" (rationes seminales)\n  # to explain how God embedded potentials in creation that could be actualized later,\n  # outside the normal \"course of nature\" (cursus naturae). This framework applies\n  # to both miracles like the virgin birth and the changes brought about by the Fall.\n\n  theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n  print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
