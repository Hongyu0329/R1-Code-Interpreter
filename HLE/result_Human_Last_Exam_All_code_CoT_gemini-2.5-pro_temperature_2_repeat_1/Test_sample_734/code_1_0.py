def find_theologian():
  # This function identifies the theologian based on the described concepts.
  # The key concepts are:
  # 1. Specialized terminology for changes in natural law.
  # 2. Application to the virgin birth (a miracle).
  # 3. Application to the Fall (an alteration of the state of nature).
  # Augustine of Hippo developed the concepts of "seminal reasons" (rationes seminales)
  # to explain how God embedded potentials in creation that could be actualized later,
  # outside the normal "course of nature" (cursus naturae). This framework applies
  # to both miracles like the virgin birth and the changes brought about by the Fall.
