def solve_bvp_norm():
    """
    Calculates the symbolic squared norm ||x(1)||^2 for the given BVP.

    The problem as stated is inconsistent. The solution to the IVP derived from
    x'(t) = Hx(t) + f(t) and x(0) = 0.5*alpha does not satisfy the boundary
    condition M*x(0) - N*x(1) = alpha for the given f(t).

    Assuming the problem intends for a solution to exist, we can determine x(1)
    directly from the two boundary conditions:
    1) x(0) = 0.5 * alpha
    2) M*x(0) - N*x(1) = alpha

    From these, we derive x_n(1) = N_n^{-1} * (M_n/2 - 1) * alpha_n.

    The problem specifies that only the component for the index k = 2^2024 is non-zero.
    For this k:
    - k is even, so M_k = 1.
    - alpha_k = 1.
    - h_k = 2^k.
    - N_k = exp(-h_k), so N_k^{-1} = exp(h_k).

    Substituting these gives:
    x_k(1) = exp(h_k) * (1/2 - 1) * 1 = -0.5 * exp(h_k).

    The squared l2-norm is ||x(1)||^2 = |x_k(1)|^2.
    ||x(1)||^2 = (-0.5 * exp(h_k))^2 = 0.25 * exp(2 * h_k)
               = (1/4) * exp(2 * 2^(2^2024)).

    This script will print the numbers that make up this final formula.
