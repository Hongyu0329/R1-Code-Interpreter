    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Theoretical Basis:** We will use a known result from knot theory, the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality. This inequality connects the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot, denoted $P(K)(a, z)$, to its minimum number of Seifert circles, denoted $s(K)$.\n2.  **The Inequality:** The inequality states that the span of the HOMFLY polynomial in the variable 'a', written as $span_a(P(K))$, is bounded by the number of Seifert circles:\n    $span_a(P(K)) \\le 2(s(K) - 1)$.\n3.  **Deriving the Lower Bound:** We can rearrange this inequality to find a lower bound for $s(K)$:\n    $s(K) \\ge \\frac{span_a(P(K))}{2} + 1$.\n4.  **Execution Steps:**\n    *   First, we need the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$. We can obtain this using the `pyknotid` library in Python.\n    *   Next, we will find the highest and lowest powers of the variable 'a' in the resulting polynomial.\n    *   The difference between these powers gives us the span, $span_a(P(K))$.\n    *   Finally, we will substitute this span value into the formula to calculate the lower bound for the number of Seifert circles.\n\nHere is the Python script that performs these calculations and provides the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n# We need the pyknotid library. If not installed, run: pip install pyknotid\ntry:\n    import pyknotid.catalogue as cat\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"The 'pyknotid' library is required.
