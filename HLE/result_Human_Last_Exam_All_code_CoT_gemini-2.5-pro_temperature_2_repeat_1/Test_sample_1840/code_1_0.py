    Solves for the smallest positive integer n such that P_n is odd.

    P_n is the number of distinct partitions of the vertices of the n x n grid
    graph into 3 sets of equal size, each inducing connected subgraphs.

    1. For the partition to be possible, n*n must be divisible by 3, which means n
       must be a multiple of 3. Possible n are 3, 6, 9, ...

    2. A symmetry argument based on reflection across the main diagonal shows that the
       parity of P_n is the same as the parity of the number of partitions that
       are symmetric with respect to this reflection.

    3. For n = 3k where k is odd (n = 3, 9, 15, ...), the size of each of the 3
       partitions (n^2/3) is an odd number.

    4. Further analysis shows that for a partition to be symmetric under this reflection,
       one of its three component subgraphs ('A') must contain all n vertices on the main
       diagonal.

    5. For n=3, the size of each partition must be 3. The subgraph 'A' must therefore
       consist of exactly the three diagonal vertices. This set of vertices is not
       connected in the grid graph. Thus, no such symmetric partitions exist for n=3.
       This means P_3 is even.

    6. This argument extends to all n which are odd multiples of 3.

    7. Therefore, n must be an even multiple of 3. The smallest such positive integer
       is 6.
