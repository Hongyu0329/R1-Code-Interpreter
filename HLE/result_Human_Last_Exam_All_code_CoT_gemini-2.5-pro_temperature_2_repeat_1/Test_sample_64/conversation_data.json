    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」, I will perform a lookup. This is typically done by consulting a specialized Japanese dictionary, such as the NHK Japanese Pronunciation Accent Dictionary. For this task, I will simulate this lookup process using a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a small, mock database within the Python script. This database will store pitch accent information for a few Japanese words, including 「弟」.\n2.  The standard pitch accent for 「弟」 (reading: おとうと, otouto) is designated by the number `[0]`.\n3.  The numerical code `[0]` corresponds to the \"Heiban\" (平板) pattern.\n4.  The script will look up the word 「弟」, retrieve its pitch accent pattern name, and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent(word_to_find):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates looking up a word's pitch accent in a dictionary.\n    The pitch accent is often represented by a number.\n    [0] = Heiban (平板): Low-High-High...\n    [1] = Atamadaka (頭高): High-Low-Low...\n    Other numbers represent Nakadaka (中高) or Odaka (尾高) depending on the position of the drop in pitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A mock database emulating a Japanese pitch accent dictionary.\n    pitch_accent_database = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n            \"pattern_code\": 0,\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Heiban\"\n        },\n        \"兄\": {\n            \"reading\": \"あに\",\n            \"pattern_code\": 1,\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Atamadaka\"\n        },\n        \"心\": {\n            \"reading\": \"こころ\",\n            \"pattern_code\": 2,\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Nakadaka\"\n        },\n        \"山\": {\n            \"reading\": \"やま\",\n            \"pattern_code\": 2,\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Odaka\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    if word_to_find in pitch_accent_database:\n        info = pitch_accent_database[word_to_find]\n        print(f\"Word: 「{word_to_find}」\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {info['reading']}\")\n        print(f\"Pitch Accent Code: [{info['pattern_code']}]\")\n        print(f\"The standard pitch accent pattern is: {info['pattern_name']}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Information for '{word_to_find}' not found in this dictionary.\")\n\n# Find and display the pitch accent for the requested word.\nfind_pitch_accent(\"弟\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
