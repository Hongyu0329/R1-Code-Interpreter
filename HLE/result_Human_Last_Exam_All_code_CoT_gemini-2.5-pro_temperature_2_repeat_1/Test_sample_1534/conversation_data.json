    "This is a question of specialized neuroanatomy. The dwarf cuttlefish brain, like that of other cephalopods, is complex. The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the subesophageal mass, which controls many of the animal's motor and autonomic functions. It is generally considered the most posterior lobe of this brain mass.\n\nMy plan is to provide the anatomical answer within a Python script. The script will store the information in a string variable and then print it to the console, fulfilling the request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef get_brain_anatomy_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides information about the brain regions posterior to the palliovisceral lobe\n    in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    anatomical_info = (\n        \"In the dwarf cuttlefish brain, the palliovisceral lobe is the most posterior major lobe \"\n        \"of the subesophageal brain mass.\\n\"\n        \"Therefore, there are no major brain 'regions' or 'lobes' located directly posterior to it.\\n\\n\"\n        \"The structures that are adjacent and extend from its posterior end are primarily:\\n\"\n        \"1. Stellar Nerves: Large nerves that innervate the mantle muscles for jet propulsion.\\n\"\n        \"2. Visceral Nerves: Nerves that control the organs in the visceral sac.\\n\\n\"\n        \"The closest lobes, located on the posterior and *dorsal* surface of the palliovisceral lobe, \"\n        \"are the Posterior Chromatophore Lobes, which control skin patterning on the back of the animal.\"\n    )\n    print(anatomical_info)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_brain_anatomy_info()\n```\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes (located on its postero-dorsal surface) are the closest brain regions. Major nerves, including the stellar and visceral nerves, exit from its posterior end.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
