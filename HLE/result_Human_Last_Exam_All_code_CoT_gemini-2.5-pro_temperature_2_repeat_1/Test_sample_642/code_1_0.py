# The problem asks for the value of the limit:
# lim_{k -> infinity} [f(k+1) - f(k)]
#
# Let's break down the function f(k).
# f(k) is the minimum number of states |Q| for a Turing machine M
# that recognizes the language L_k = {w in {0,1}^* : |w|_1 is divisible by k}.
#
# 1. A simple machine (like a DFA) would keep a counter in its states,
#    requiring k states. For this model, f(k) = k. The limit would be
#    lim [k+1 - k] = 1.
#
# 2. However, a Turing machine can use its infinite tape to optimize states.
#    It doesn't need to store the counter in its states. Instead, it can
#    write the count on the tape.
#
# 3. The most state-efficient TM for this task for large k would be one that
#    encodes the number k in its structure.
#    The number of states needed to "know" k is proportional to the amount of
#    information in k, which is about log_2(k) bits.
#
#    The machine's algorithm would be:
#    a) Write k on the tape. This takes O(log k) states.
#    b) Count the number of 1's in the input and write the result, N, on the tape.
#       This part can be done with a constant number of states.
#    c) Perform a division of N by k on the tape. A generic algorithm for
#       dividing two numbers on a tape requires a constant number of states,
#       regardless of the size of the numbers.
#
# 4. Therefore, the state complexity is dominated by the need to encode k.
#    f(k) is proportional to log(k), i.e., f(k) = Theta(log k).
#
# 5. We need to compute the limit of the difference:
#    lim_{k -> inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)]
#
#    Let's approximate f(k) with a continuous function c*log(k).
#    The difference becomes c*log(k+1) - c*log(k) = c*log((k+1)/k) = c*log(1 + 1/k).
#
# 6. As k approaches infinity, 1/k approaches 0.
#    The limit becomes c*log(1 + 0) = c*log(1) = 0.
#
# 7. Even though f(k) must be an integer, its rate of growth is sub-linear.
#    The difference f(k+1) - f(k) is an integer that must tend towards 0.
#    This implies that for any epsilon > 0.5, eventually |f(k+1) - f(k) - 0| < 0.5,
#    which means f(k+1) - f(k) = 0 for sufficiently large k.
#    The steps in the function f(k) become infinitely sparse.
#    The limit of the difference is 0.
