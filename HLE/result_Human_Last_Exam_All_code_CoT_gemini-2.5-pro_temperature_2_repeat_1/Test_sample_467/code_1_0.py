    # Step 1: Define the Gauss map g(z) = P(z) / Q(z) and find its degree 'd'.
    # The Gauss map is given as g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
    # We represent the polynomials by their coefficients (highest power first).

    Q_coeffs = [1, 0, 0, 2]  # Q(z) = 1*z^3 + 0*z^2 + 0*z + 2

    # Step 2: Identify the topological parameters 'r' and 'gamma'.
    # The surface is conformally equivalent to C (the complex plane).
    # This means it is topologically a sphere (genus 0) with one puncture.
    gamma = 0  # Genus of the underlying compact surface (the sphere)

    # Step 3: Apply the Morse Index formula for minimal surfaces in R^3.
    # The formula is: Index = 2*d - r + 1 - 2*gamma
    index = 2 * d - r + 1 - 2 * gamma

    # Step 4: Print the final calculation and result.
