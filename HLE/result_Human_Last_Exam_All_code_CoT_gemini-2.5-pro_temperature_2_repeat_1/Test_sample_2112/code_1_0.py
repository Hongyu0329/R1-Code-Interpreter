# The problem asks for a value r_0 > 15 where Phi(r_0) = 0.
# A common pattern in such problems is that r_0 has a special property that
# simplifies one of the complex arguments.
# Let's test the hypothesis that one of the arguments becomes a simple integer, like 1.

# Case 1: The first argument equals 1
# eq1 = arg1 - 1
# solutions1 = sympy.solve(eq1, r)
# sol1 = solutions1[0] if solutions1 else None
# Since 4r+37 = 3-r -> 5r = -34 -> r = -6.8, which is not > 15.

# Case 2: The second argument equals 1
# This implies its numerator equals its denominator.
eq2 = arg2_num - arg2_den
solutions2 = sympy.solve(eq2, r)
r_0 = solutions2[0] if solutions2 else None

# The solution from this hypothesis is r_0 = 41/2 = 20.5.
# This satisfies the condition r > 15.

# Let's print the solution.
# The simplified equation when Phi(r_0) = 0 is Phi(arg1(r_0)) + Phi(arg2(r_0)) = 9.
# We found r_0 such that arg2(r_0) = 1.
r0_val = 20.5
arg2_val_at_r0 = 1

# Calculate the value of the first argument at r_0
arg1_val_at_r0 = (4*r0_val + 37) / (3 - r0_val)

# The resulting equation demonstrates the simplification.
# Let's display it. Note: we cannot display "Phi" but we can show the equation with its arguments.
