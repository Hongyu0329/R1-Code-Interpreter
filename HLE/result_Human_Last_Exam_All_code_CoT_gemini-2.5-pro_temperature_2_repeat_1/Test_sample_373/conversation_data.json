    "The problem asks for the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during a single step of randomized uniform gossiping. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve this:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: A 10-node barbell graph consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge, which is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees**:\n    *   There are two cliques of 5 nodes (K5).\n    *   In a K5, each node is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n    *   The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge have one additional connection.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of the 8 non-bottleneck nodes is 4.\n    *   The degree of the 2 bottleneck nodes is `4 (within-clique) + 1 (bottleneck) = 5`.\n3.  **Calculate the Probability**: Randomized uniform gossiping involves two steps:\n    *   **Step A**: Pick a node `u` uniformly at random from all 10 nodes. The probability of picking any specific node is `1/10`.\n    *   **Step B**: From the chosen node `u`, pick one of its neighbors `v` uniformly at random. The probability of picking a specific neighbor is `1 / degree(u)`.\n4.  **Combine Probabilities**: The bottleneck edge can be sampled in two ways:\n    *   **Path 1**: Select the bottleneck node in the first clique (probability `1/10`), and then it selects its neighbor across the bridge (probability `1/5`). Total probability for Path 1: `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   **Path 2**: Select the bottleneck node in the second clique (probability `1/10`), and then it selects its neighbor across the bridge (probability `1/5`). Total probability for Path 2: `(1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n5.  **Final Probability**: The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive paths. Total probability = `1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\n# Graph parameters\ntotal_nodes = 10\nclique_size = 5\n\n# The bottleneck edge connects two nodes, one from each clique.\n# Let's calculate the degree of these two specific nodes.\n# Degree = (connections within their clique) + (the bottleneck connection)\ndegree_of_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n# --- Probability Calculation ---\n# The gossiping process:\n# 1. A node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes.\nprob_select_any_node = fractions.Fraction(1, total_nodes)\n\n# 2. The selected node chooses a neighbor uniformly at random.\n# We only care if one of the two bottleneck nodes is chosen.\nprob_bottleneck_node_selects_bridge = fractions.Fraction(1, degree_of_bottleneck_node)\n\n# The bottleneck edge can be sampled in two symmetric ways:\n# - Pick the first bottleneck node AND that node picks the bridge.\n# - Pick the second bottleneck node AND that node picks thebridge.\nprob_path1 = prob_select_any_node * prob_bottleneck_node_selects_bridge\nprob_path2 = prob_select_any_node * prob_bottleneck_node_selects_bridge\n\ntotal_probability = prob_path1 + prob_path2\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(\"Calculating the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph.\")\nprint(f\"A 10-node barbell graph has two cliques of {clique_size} nodes.\")\nprint(f\"The degree of each of the 2 nodes connected by the bottleneck edge is {degree_of_bottleneck_node}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe probability is the sum of two scenarios:\")\nprint(\"1.
