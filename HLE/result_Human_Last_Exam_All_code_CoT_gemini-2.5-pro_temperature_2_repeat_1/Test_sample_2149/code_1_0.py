# Values derived from the clues
# Y1 from Clue 1: The year of Drake's oil well is 1859.
Y1 = 1859

# From Y1 = X1X2X3X4, we get:
# X1=1, X2=8, X3=5, X4=9

# From Clue 2, the remaining variables are the digits of Pi with the number 4 removed.
# Pi without 4s = 3.115926535...
# So, X5=3, X6=1, X7=1, X8=5, X9=9, X10=2, X11=6
X9 = 9
X10 = 2
X11 = 6

# Y4 is formed from X9, X10, and X11.
# It is an integer, not a sum.
Y4 = int(f"{X9}{X10}{X11}")

# Topological state indices from the reactants of the original Heck reaction.
# Reactant 1: Phenylmercuric chloride (C6H5HgCl) -> 6 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 13 atoms.
index1 = 13
# Reactant 2: Ethylene (C2H4) -> 2 + 4 = 6 atoms.
index2 = 6

# Calculate the final result
result = (Y4 / Y1) * index1 * index2

# Output the equation with all the numbers
print(f"Equation: ({Y4} / {Y1}) * {index1} * {index2}")

# Print the final numerical answer
print(f"Result: {result}")

# The puzzle asks for the final answer in a specific format.
# Let's format the floating point number as requested.
final_answer = result
print(f"\nFinal Answer: <<<{final_answer}>>>")
