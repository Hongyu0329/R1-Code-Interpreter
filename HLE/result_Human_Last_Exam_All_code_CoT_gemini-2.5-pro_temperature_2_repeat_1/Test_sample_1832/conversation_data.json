    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic problem in general relativity. To find the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we need to use the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the metric:** The spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged massive body is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n2.  **Define the metric components:** I'll set up the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ in spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$. This tensor is diagonal, and its components depend on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$.\n3.  **Use the Christoffel symbol formula:** The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the metric using the formula:\n    $$ \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\rho\\sigma}\\left(\\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma}\\right) $$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n4.  **Automate with code:** Manually calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ potential components is tedious and prone to error. I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform these calculations automatically.\n5.  **Count and display the result:** The script will iterate through all possible indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$, compute the corresponding Christoffel symbol, simplify it, and check if it's non-zero. Finally, it will print the total count of the non-zero symbols and show the summation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
