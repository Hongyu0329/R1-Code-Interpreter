    "The Gauss class number problem, specifically determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number, is a computationally intensive task in number theory. The complete lists for class numbers up to 100 were famously computed by Mark Watkins. For larger class numbers, the problem is generally unsolved.\n\nInstead of performing a full-scale computation, which would require a specialized number theory library like PARI/GP and significant computing resources, I will provide a Python script that looks up the answer from a pre-computed table of results derived from Watkins's work. This approach leverages the known mathematical results to answer your question accurately.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define a dictionary containing the known counts of negative fundamental discriminants for several class numbers.\n2.  Specify the target class number, which is 48.\n3.  Retrieve and print the corresponding count from the dictionary.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gauss_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number\n    by looking up the value from a pre-computed dictionary of results.\n\n    The data is based on the comprehensive computations by Mark Watkins for\n    class numbers up to 100.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping class number (h) to the number of negative fundamental\n    # discriminants with that class number.\n    # Source: OEIS A006203 / Watkins, M.
