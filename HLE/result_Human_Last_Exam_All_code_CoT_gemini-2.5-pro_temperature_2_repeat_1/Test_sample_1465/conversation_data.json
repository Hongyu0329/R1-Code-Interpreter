    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the oligomeric state of these protein sequences.\n\nCoiled-coil oligomerization is primarily determined by the identity of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The packing of these core residues dictates whether the helices form a dimer, trimer, tetramer, or higher-order oligomer. I will analyze each sequence based on established principles of coiled-coil design.\n\n1.  **Sequence 1**: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`. The core 'a' positions are occupied by Alanine (A) and the 'd' positions by Leucine (L). This `a=A, d=L` pattern is known to favor the formation of **trimers**.\n2.  **Sequence 2**: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`. The key feature here is an Asparagine (N) at one of the 'a' positions. Polar residues at core positions are significant determinants. An Asn at the 'a' position is a classic motif that strongly promotes the formation of a parallel **dimer**.\n3.  **Sequence 3**: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`. This sequence has Alanine (A) at the 'a' positions and the beta-branched amino acid Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' positions. The packing of Isoleucine at the 'd' position is highly favorable in a **trimeric** interface.\n4.  **Sequence 4**: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`. The 'd' positions are Leucine (L), while the 'a' positions are mostly the charged residue Lysine (K) with one bulky Tryptophan (W). While unusual, this combination is predicted by coiled-coil algorithms like `LOGICOIL` to form a **trimer**.\n5.  **Sequence 5**: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`. Here, the core 'd' positions are occupied by the polar amino acid Threonine (T). A polar residue like Threonine in the hydrophobic 'd' position is a well-studied motif that drives the formation of parallel **tetramers**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the predicted oligomeric states are 3, 2, 3, 3, and 4. I will now generate a Python script to present these results.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil protein sequences based on\n    known design principles of residues at the 'a' and 'd' heptad repeat positions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\"\n    ]\n\n    # Predictions based on coiled-coil design rules\n    # 1.
