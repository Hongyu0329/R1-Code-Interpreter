    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph Definition**: The graph \\(G\\) is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\". I'll interpret this as the graph union on a shared set of \\(n\\) vertices. The resulting graph \\(G\\) has \\(n\\) vertices, and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles.\n\n2.  **Analyze Graph Properties**: I will analyze the key properties of \\(G\\), specifically its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\). This is crucial because the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is bounded by \\( \\Delta(G) \\). The degree of any vertex is at most \\(2+2+2 = 6\\).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Strategy**: The goal is to find the *maximal* chromatic number. This means we must consider the most \"complex\" version of \\(G\\) we can construct. A graph's complexity, in terms of chromatic number, is often related to the size of its largest clique (a subgraph that is a complete graph). I'll investigate the maximum size of a clique we can form within \\(G\\).\n\n4.  **Case-based Analysis on n**: The structure of the graph and its capabilities change with \\(n\\). I will split the analysis into two main cases:\n    *   **Case 1: Small \\(n\\) (\\(n \\le 7\\))**: In this case, it might be possible for \\(G\\) itself to be a complete graph \\(K_n\\). I will check if the number of edges in \\(K_n\\) can be provided by three \\(n\\)-cycles. If so, the chromatic number is \\(n\\).\n    *   **Case 2: Large \\(n\\) (\\(n > 7\\))**: For larger \\(n\\), \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph \\(K_n\\) as its maximum degree is limited to 6. I'll determine the largest possible clique that can be embedded in \\(G\\) as a subgraph. By showing that a \\(K_6\\) is possible and leveraging Brooks's theorem, I can find the precise maximal chromatic number.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Code**: Finally, I will synthesize these findings into a Python script. The script will explain the logic and calculate the maximal chromatic number for different example values of \\(n\\) to illustrate both cases, printing all reasoning and final equations as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\ndef explain_and_calculate(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the logic and calculates the maximal chromatic number\n    for a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing for n = {n} ---\")\n    if n < 3:\n        print(\"Error: The length of a cycle (n) must be an integer greater than or equal to 3.\")\n        return\n\n    # Case 1: n is small (n <= 7)\n    if n <= 7:\n        result = n\n        print(\"Analysis:\")\n        print(f\"  When n is less than or equal to 7, it is possible to construct the graph G to be a complete graph K_{n}.\")\n        print(f\"  To verify this, we can compare the edges required for K_{n} with the maximum edges three C_{n} can provide.\")\n        k_n_edges = n * (n - 1) // 2\n        max_g_edges = 3 * n\n        print(f\"  Number of edges required for K_{n}: n * (n - 1) / 2 = {k_n_edges}\")\n        print(f\"  Maximum possible edges in G from three C_{n}: 3 * n = {max_g_edges}\")\n        print(f\"  The condition to form K_{n} is that {k_n_edges} <= {max_g_edges}, which simplifies to n - 1 <= 6, or n <= 7.
