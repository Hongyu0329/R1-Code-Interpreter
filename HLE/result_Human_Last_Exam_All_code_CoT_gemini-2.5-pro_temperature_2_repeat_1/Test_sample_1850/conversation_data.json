    "I will solve this by writing a Python script to find the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will use the `requests` library to download the full text of *Paradise Lost* from the Project Gutenberg website.\n2.  Based on literary analysis of the poem, the historical holy figures Milton mentions by name are primarily from the Old Testament, particularly in Books I, XI, and XII. New Testament saints like Peter or Paul are not mentioned by name.\n3.  I will create a list of these specific Old Testament saints and patriarchs to search for: Noah, Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, David, and Solomon.\n4.  I will iterate through this list and use regular expressions to search for each name in the downloaded text. The search will be case-insensitive and will look for whole words only, to avoid false positives (e.g., matching \"arch\" in \"monarch\").\n5.  Finally, I will print each saint's name as it's found and then display the total count.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef find_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script downloads John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and counts the number\n    of pre-defined historical saints mentioned by name within the text.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The URL for the plain text version of \"Paradise Lost\" from Project Gutenberg.\n    url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20/20-0.txt\"\n    \n    # Based on analysis of the text, Milton names several Old Testament figures\n    # who are revered as saints or holy men, but does not name New Testament saints.\n    saints_list = [\n        \"Noah\", \"Enoch\", \"Abraham\", \"Isaac\", \"Jacob\",\n        \"Moses\", \"Joshua\", \"David\", \"Solomon\"\n    ]\n    \n    found_saints = []\n\n    print(\"Attempting to download 'Paradise Lost'...\")\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=20)\n        # Raise an HTTPError if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code.\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        text = response.text\n        print(\"Download complete.
