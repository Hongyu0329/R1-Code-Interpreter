    print("Reasoning:")
    print("The farness of a lattice L is the smallest d such that L is a d-neighbor of Z^n.")
    print("A d-neighbor relation connects two lattices L1 and L2 if they share a common sublattice K of index d in both.")
    print("The lattice Z^n is an odd lattice for any n, as e.g., the vector (1,0,...,0) has an odd norm of 1.")
    print("An even unimodular lattice is, by definition, even.")
    print("Previously, it was a common misconception that neighboring preserves the type (even/odd) of a lattice.")
    print("However, Kneser's theorem on genera implies that p-neighboring preserves the genus only for primes p that do not divide 2*det(L).")
    print("For a unimodular lattice (det=1), this means only neighbors for odd primes p must preserve the genus.")
    print("2-neighboring, therefore, CAN change the genus, and specifically can change an odd lattice into an even one.")
    print("A famous example is the E8 lattice (even, rank 8) which is a 2-neighbor of Z^8 (odd).")
    print("By analogy, it is plausible that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can be constructed as a 2-neighbor of Z^12.")
