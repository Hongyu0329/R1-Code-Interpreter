    "In this chess puzzle, we are asked to find the number of moves for White to achieve a forced checkmate against Black, assuming optimal play from both sides. The position is given by the FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Use a Chess Engine**: The most reliable way to solve a \"mate in N\" puzzle is to use a powerful chess engine like Stockfish. Human analysis can be prone to errors, especially in complex tactical sequences.\n2.  **Setup the Environment**: The Python script will use the `python-chess` library to represent the board and communicate with the engine. It will also require the Stockfish engine to be installed on the user's system. The script will include instructions for installation and will try to automatically locate the Stockfish executable.\n3.  **Analyze the Position**: The script will load the board from the given FEN string and instruct the engine to analyze it. The engine will calculate the best sequence of moves and determine if a forced mate exists.\n4.  **Extract and Display the Solution**: If the engine finds a mate, the script will extract the number of moves (`N`) and the winning sequence of moves (the Principal Variation).\n5.  **Format the Output**: The script will then print:\n    *   The total number of moves for White to win.\n    *   The complete move sequence, formatted clearly with move numbers (e.g., `1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 ...`). This fulfills the request to show the steps and \"output each number in the final equation,\" which I interpret as showing the individual moves and their numbers in the winning line.\n    *   Finally, the numerical answer will be provided in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures an accurate solution and provides a clear, step-by-step explanation of the winning play.\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport chess.engine\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a given FEN string to find the shortest mate for White.\n    It uses the Stockfish chess engine to find the optimal line of play.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Explain and find Stockfish engine ---\n    # The script requires the Stockfish chess engine to be installed and accessible\n    # in the system's PATH.
