    explanation = """
    Step-by-step thinking process to identify the disadvantage of air-stable organic radicals in OLEDs:

    1.  **Understand the Advantage:** Organic radicals have a doublet ground state (D₀) and a doublet excited state (D₁). The emission from D₁ to D₀ is spin-allowed. This bypasses the limitations of traditional fluorescent materials where only singlet excitons (25% of the total) can emit efficiently. Therefore, radicals theoretically allow for 100% internal quantum efficiency.

    2.  **Evaluate the Disadvantage Choices:**
        *   **Choice A (not stable to oxygen):** This contradicts the question's premise of "air-stable" radicals. So, this is incorrect.
        *   **Choice B (wide FWDH):** A wide emission peak (low color purity) can be a problem, but it is not the most fundamental or unique challenge to this class of materials compared to all non-radical emitters.
        *   **Choice E (delocalization causes multiple emissions):** This is physically incorrect. Delocalization is what provides the stability to the radical; it does not cause multiple emissions or inherently low efficiency.
        *   **Choices C and D (quenching):** These choices point to the correct issue. Radicals, being open-shell species, can interact with each other in a process called bimolecular annihilation or quenching. An excited radical (the exciton) can collide with a ground-state radical, causing a non-radiative decay instead of light emission.
        
    3.  **Compare C and D:**
        *   Choice C states this leads to 'low luminance'.
        *   Choice D states this leads to 'low EQE' (External Quantum Efficiency).
        
        Low EQE is the more fundamental problem. EQE measures the ratio of photons emitted to electrons injected, which is the core efficiency of the device. The quenching mechanism directly reduces this ratio. While this can also limit the maximum luminance, the primary impact is on efficiency. Therefore, describing the problem as low EQE due to quenching of excitons by radicals is the most precise and accurate scientific explanation. This is the main hurdle that researchers in the field are trying to overcome.
