    "Answering this question involves methods from the theory of integral equations.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a separable (or degenerate) kernel because it can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and y.\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}`.\n\n2.  **Reduce to a Linear System**: By substituting the form of the kernel into the integral equation, we can see that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. We can then substitute a general polynomial form for `u(x)` back into the equation. This process transforms the integral equation into a system of `n` linear algebraic equations for `n` unknown coefficients (the moments of `u(x)`). The system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λM)C = b`.\n\n3.  **Find Critical Values of λ**: The system fails to have a unique solution if the matrix `(I - λM)` is singular, which means `det(I - λM) = 0`. This is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues `μ` of the matrix `M`, where `λ = 1/μ`. These are the characteristic values of λ.\n\n4.  **Apply Fredholm Alternative**: For these specific values of `λ`, the equation can have either no solution or infinitely many solutions. The Fredholm alternative theorem states that a solution exists only if the function on the left side (in our case, `f(x) = 1`) is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator. For the symmetric kernel we have, this condition simplifies to checking if `1` is orthogonal to the eigenfunctions `u(x)` corresponding to the eigenvalue `μ = 1/λ`. The condition is `∫₀¹ 1 * u(x) dx = 0`. Our analysis shows this condition is generally not met, which means for these values of `λ`, the system is inconsistent and there are no solutions.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: The plan is implemented in the Python code below. The script constructs the `n x n` matrix `M` (where `M_{ij} = 1/(n+i-j)`), calculates its eigenvalues `μ`, and then finds the corresponding values of `λ` by taking the reciprocal, `λ = 1/μ`. The user can specify the value of `n`.\n\nHere is the Python code to find these values of `λ`. The script is set for `n=4` but you can change the value of `n` in the first line to solve for other cases.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent 'n' in the integral equation.
