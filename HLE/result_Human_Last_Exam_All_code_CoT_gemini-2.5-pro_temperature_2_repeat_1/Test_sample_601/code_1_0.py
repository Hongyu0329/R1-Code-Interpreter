# The task is to determine the smallest number of operations needed for a specific
# transformation in a Fibonacci heap. The answer is a number derived from the analysis
# of the heap's operations. The code will present this derivation.

# Number of Insert operations
num_insert = 1

# Number of Decrease-key operations
num_decrease_key = 1

# Number of Delete-min operations
num_delete_min = 1

# The problem is about transforming a k-item chain to a (k+1)-item chain.
# A chain is an atypical structure for a Fibonacci heap, which naturally forms
# binomial-like trees. Creating or extending a chain requires fighting this tendency.
#
# A minimal sequence of operations is as follows:
# 1. Insert a new node, which will become the (k+1)-th item of the chain.
# 2. Use Decrease-key on an existing node in the chain (e.g., the leaf) to cut it
#    and place it in the root list, preparing it for re-linking.
# 3. Use Delete-min (often on a dummy minimal element inserted for this purpose,
#    though for minimum operations count we consider the operations on the core nodes)
#    to trigger consolidation, which links the new node and the detached leaf to form a
#    longer chain. A careful choice of keys and operations ensures the chain structure is achieved.
#
# This constitutes 3 fundamental operations.

total_operations = num_insert + num_decrease_key + num_delete_min

print("The smallest number of operations can be broken down as follows:")
