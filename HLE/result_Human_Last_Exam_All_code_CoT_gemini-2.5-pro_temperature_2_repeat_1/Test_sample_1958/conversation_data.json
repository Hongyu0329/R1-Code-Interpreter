    "To solve this, I will first determine which books of the Bible are mentioned by name in Shakespeare's plays and in which plays these mentions occur. Then, I will organize these books according to their canonical order in the Bible to find the first one on the list.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Create a list of Bible books in their canonical order (Old Testament, then New Testament).\n2.  Create a dictionary containing the Shakespearean plays where specific Bible books are mentioned by name. This will be based on established literary research. The most direct and unambiguous mentions will be prioritized. For example, \"the Hundredth Psalm\" is a direct reference to the Book of Psalms, and \"Corinthians\" is a reference to the Epistles to the Corinthians. Mentions of characters like \"Daniel\" or \"Job\" will be considered allusions to the characters, not mentions of the books by name.\n3.  Iterate through the canonical list of Bible books.\n4.  For each book, check if it exists as a key in my dictionary of mentions.\n5.  The first book found in the canonical list that is also in the dictionary is the answer.\n6.  The program will then print the name of this book and the play in which it is mentioned.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_first_mentioned_bible_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first book of the Bible, in canonical order,\n    mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Canonical order of the 66 books of the Protestant Bible\n    canonical_bible_books = [\n        \"Genesis\", \"Exodus\", \"Leviticus\", \"Numbers\", \"Deuteronomy\",\n        \"Joshua\", \"Judges\", \"Ruth\", \"1 Samuel\", \"2 Samuel\", \"1 Kings\", \"2 Kings\",\n        \"1 Chronicles\", \"2 Chronicles\", \"Ezra\", \"Nehemiah\", \"Esther\", \"Job\",\n        \"Psalms\", \"Proverbs\", \"Ecclesiastes\", \"Song of Solomon\", \"Isaiah\",\n        \"Jeremiah\", \"Lamentations\", \"Ezekiel\", \"Daniel\", \"Hosea\", \"Joel\",\n        \"Amos\", \"Obadiah\", \"Jonah\", \"Micah\", \"Nahum\", \"Habakkuk\", \"Zephaniah\",\n        \"Haggai\", \"Zechariah\", \"Malachi\", \"Matthew\", \"Mark\", \"Luke\", \"John\",\n        \"Acts\", \"Romans\", \"1 Corinthians\", \"2 Corinthians\", \"Galatians\",\n        \"Ephesians\", \"Philippians\", \"Colossians\", \"1 Thessalonians\",\n        \"2 Thessalonians\", \"1 Timothy\", \"2 Timothy\", \"Titus\", \"Philemon\",\n        \"Hebrews\", \"James\", \"1 Peter\", \"2 Peter\", \"1 John\", \"2 John\",\n        \"3 John\", \"Jude\", \"Revelation\"\n    ]\n\n    # A dictionary of direct Bible book mentions in Shakespeare's plays.\n    # We use a key like \"Corinthians\" to represent both 1 & 2 Corinthians.\n    # The most unambiguous mentions are included.\n    mentions_in_shakespeare = {\n        \"Psalms\": \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\",\n        \"Corinthians\": \"Henry IV, Part 1\",\n        # Note: \"Daniel\" and \"Job\" are mentioned as people, not books.\n        # \"Proverbs\" is mentioned, but ambiguously (\"patch grief with proverbs\").\n        # The mention of \"the Hundredth Psalm\" is a very direct reference to the Book of Psalms.\n    }\n    \n    # We use a special key for Corinthians since it's mentioned without 1 or 2\n    mentions_in_shakespeare[\"1 Corinthians\"] = mentions_in_shakespeare[\"Corinthians\"]\n    mentions_in_shakespeare[\"2 Corinthians\"] = mentions_in_shakespeare[\"Corinthians\"]\n\n    # Iterate through the canonical list to find the first match\n    for book in canonical_bible_books:\n        if book in mentions_in_shakespeare:\n            play = mentions_in_shakespeare[book]\n            # Found the first one\n            print(f\"The first book in the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of {book}.\")\n            print(f\"It is mentioned in the play: '{play}'.\")\n            return\n\nfind_first_mentioned_bible_book()\n```\n<<<The first book in the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Psalms.
