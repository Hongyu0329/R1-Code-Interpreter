    "My plan is to decipher the riddle by analyzing the given clues to identify the historical figure.\n\n1.  **\"a joy-discovering sailor\" by Andrei Voznesensky:** This specific, poetic phrase points towards Voznesensky's work. It's from his famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\").\n2.  **Subject of the opera:** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian explorer and statesman Nikolai Rezanov. He undertook a famous sea voyage to what is now California.\n3.  **\"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" and \"answer...emerged in the late 1980s\":** Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk while returning from his journey. His original grave was destroyed during the Soviet era. Efforts to locate his remains were publicized and a new monument was established, with significant attention on this rediscovery in the late 20th century, fitting the \"late 1980s\" timeframe of renewed historical interest during Perestroika.\n\nBased on these points, the man is Nikolai Rezanov. The code below will print his last name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the historical riddle based on the provided clues.\n    \n    Clue 1: The quote \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is from Andrei Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n    Clue 2: The opera is about the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n    Clue 3: Rezanov's grave was lost for many years and rediscovered in Krasnoyarsk in the latter half of the 20th century.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    print(f\"The man's last name is: {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
