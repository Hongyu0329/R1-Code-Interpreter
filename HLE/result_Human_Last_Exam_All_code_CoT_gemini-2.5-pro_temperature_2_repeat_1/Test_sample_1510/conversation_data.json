    "Of the 17 wallpaper groups, we need to identify those whose associated point group has exactly two symmetry operations (i.e., has an order of 2).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:** First, I will determine which of the 10 two-dimensional crystallographic point groups have an order of 2. These are the group '2' (also called C2), which consists of the identity and a 180-degree rotation, and the group 'm' (also called D1), which consists of the identity and a reflection.\n2.  **Map Wallpaper Groups:** I will create a comprehensive list of all 17 wallpaper groups and their corresponding point groups.\n3.  **Count and Sum:** I will then write a Python script to iterate through this data. The script will count how many wallpaper groups are associated with point group '2' and how many are associated with point group 'm'. Finally, it will sum these counts to get the total and print the result as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A mapping of the 17 wallpaper groups to their corresponding crystallographic point group.\n    wallpaper_to_point_group = {\n        'p1': '1',\n        'p2': '2',\n        'pm': 'm',\n        'pg': 'm',\n        'cm': 'm',\n        'p2mm': '2mm',\n        'p2mg': '2mm',\n        'p2gg': '2mm',\n        'c2mm': '2mm',\n        'p3': '3',\n        'p3m1': '3m',\n        'p31m': '3m',\n        'p4': '4',\n        'p4mm': '4mm',\n        'p4gm': '4mm',\n        'p6': '6',\n        'p6mm': '6mm',\n    }\n\n    # The order (number of symmetry operations) for each point group.\n    point_group_orders = {\n        '1': 1,\n        '2': 2,    # Point group of order 2\n        'm': 2,    # Point group of order 2\n        '2mm': 4,\n        '3': 3,\n        '3m': 6,\n        '4': 4,\n        '4mm': 8,\n        '6': 6,\n        '6mm': 12,\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    groups_by_pg = {}\n\n    # Iterate through all wallpaper groups and categorize them by their point group\n    # if the point group has the target order.\n    for wg_name, pg_name in wallpaper_to_point_group.items():\n        if point_group_orders.get(pg_name) == target_order:\n            if pg_name not in groups_by_pg:\n                groups_by_pg[pg_name] = []\n            groups_by_pg[pg_name].append(wg_name)\n    \n    print(\"Finding wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2...\")\n    \n    counts = []\n    total_count = 0\n\n    # Print the details for each relevant point group\n    for pg_name, wg_list in sorted(groups_by_pg.items()):\n        count = len(wg_list)\n        print(f\"\\nPoint group '{pg_name}' has order {target_order}.\")\n        print(f\"Associated wallpaper groups: {', '.join(sorted(wg_list))}\")\n        print(f\"Count: {count}\")\n        counts.append(str(count))\n        total_count += count\n    \n    # Print the final equation as requested\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(counts)\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number is the sum of these counts.\")\n    print(f\"Total = {final_equation} = {total_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
