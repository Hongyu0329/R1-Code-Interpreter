# 1. Define the numbers extracted from the haiku.
num_from_line2 = 30  # "Twice fifteen"
num_from_line1 = 8   # "An August tempest" -> August is the 8th month.
num_from_line3 = 1   # "A divine one"

# 2. The phrases "brings winds of change" and "yields" suggest subtraction.
#    The equation is formed based on the flow of the poem.
result = num_from_line2 - num_from_line1 - num_from_line3

# 3. Convert the numeric result to its corresponding letter of the alphabet.
#    A=1, B=2, ..., so we add 64 to the number to get the correct ASCII value.
final_letter = chr(result + 64)

# 4. Print the steps and the final equation as requested.
