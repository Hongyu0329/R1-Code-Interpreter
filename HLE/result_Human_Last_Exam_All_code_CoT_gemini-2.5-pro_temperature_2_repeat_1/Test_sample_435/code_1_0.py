    print("1. Background on Interleukin-15 (IL-15) Function:")
    print("   - IL-15 is a cytokine that acts as a powerful growth and survival signal for T cells.")
    print("   - Its key functions include stimulating T cell proliferation and, importantly, promoting the development of long-lived, less-differentiated memory T cells.")
    print("   - T cells cultured with IL-15 are generally more persistent and metabolically fit.")

    print("\n---")

    print("2. Background on CAR T Cell Cytokine Release:")
    print("   - CAR T cells are engineered to recognize and attack cancer cells.")
    print("   - When a CAR T cell binds to its target on a cancer cell, it becomes activated and releases a payload of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., Interferon-gamma, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha).")
    print("   - This cytokine release is critical for the direct killing of tumor cells and for orchestrating a wider anti-tumor immune response.")

    print("\n---")

    print("3. Prediction:")
    print("   - Given the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured in the presence of IL-15 would be expected to have superior fitness, persistence, and a more youthful, memory-like phenotype compared to those made without it.")
    print("   - Therefore, it is predicted that IL-15-treated CAR T cells would exhibit an ENHANCED cytokine release profile upon encountering their target cancer cells.")
    print("   - This enhancement would likely manifest in two ways:")
    print("     * A) More Robust Release: A higher quantity of cytokines released per cell, leading to more potent initial anti-tumor activity.")
    print("     * B) More Sustained Release: The ability to continue releasing cytokines over a longer period, as the cells are less prone to exhaustion and persist for longer in the body.")

    print("\n---")
    
    print("4. Conclusion & Clinical Context:")
    print("   - In summary, adding Interleukin-15 during the manufacturing process is predicted to significantly boost the functional capacity of CAR T cells, including their ability to release cytokines.")
    print("   - While this is highly desirable for therapeutic efficacy, it is also important to note that excessive cytokine release can increase the risk of a toxic side effect known as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).")
