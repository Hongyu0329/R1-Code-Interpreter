Interleukin-15 would be predicted to enhance cytokine release in CAR T cells, making it more robust and sustained upon antigen encounter, due to its role in promoting T cell survival, proliferation, and memory formation. This leads to improved anti-tumor function but may also increase the risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome.
