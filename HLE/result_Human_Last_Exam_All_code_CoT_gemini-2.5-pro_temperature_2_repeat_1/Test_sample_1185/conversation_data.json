    "To find the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, we can classify the possible structures of singular stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. This is a well-established problem in algebraic geometry, and the solution can be found by enumerating all possible \"stable dual graphs\" of genus 2.\n\nA stable curve of genus `g ≥ 2` is a connected curve with at most nodal singularities, such that its automorphism group is finite. This is equivalent to a condition on each of its components: for any component `C` of geometric genus `g_C` with `n` nodes on it, the condition `2*g_C - 2 + n > 0` must hold.\n\nThe total arithmetic genus of a curve composed of `k` components is given by `g = Σ g_i + δ - k + 1`, where `g_i` are the geometric genera of the components, `δ` is the number of nodes, and `k` is the number of components. For a stable reduction of a genus 2 curve, the resulting stable curve must have an arithmetic genus of 2.\n\nThe Python script below systematically enumerates all possible configurations of components (up to 2, as it can be shown no stable configuration exists for more) and nodes that result in a stable curve of genus 2. It checks the stability condition for each component and counts the number of valid singular configurations.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_stable(g, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the stability condition for a component.\n    g: geometric genus of the component\n    n: number of nodes on the component\n    \"\"\"\n    stability_value = 2 * g - 2 + n\n    #print(f\"    - Checking stability: 2*g - 2 + n = 2*{g} - 2 + {n} = {stability_value}\")\n    return stability_value > 0\n\ndef get_singular_stable_curves():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and describes all types of singular stable curves of genus 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    \n    print(\"Enumerating possible singular stable curves of genus 2:\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Case 1: Irreducible curves (1 component) ---\n    # Formula: g_comp + num_nodes = 2\n    # We are looking for singular curves, so num_nodes > 0.\n    \n    # Subcase 1.1: 1 component of genus 1\n    g = 1\n    num_nodes = 1\n    num_components = 1\n    \n    # For an irreducible curve, p_a = g_geom + num_nodes = 1 + 1 = 2\n    if is_stable(g, num_nodes):\n        count += 1\n        print(f\"{count}.
