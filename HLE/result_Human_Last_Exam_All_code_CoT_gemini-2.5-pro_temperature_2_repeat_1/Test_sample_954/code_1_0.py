    Analyzes the graph process to determine the asymptotic bounds on the number of steps.

    The process involves vertices losing life in each step based on their own degree and the degrees of their neighbors.
    A key observation is that any vertex 'u' whose degree is greater than or equal to all of its neighbors' degrees will lose exactly 1 life point in a single step.
    Since all vertices start with 1 life, such a vertex is removed immediately.

    In any connected component of a forest, there must be at least one vertex with a maximum degree for that component. This vertex is a local maximum and is removed in the first step.
    This removal can trigger a cascade that dismantles the graph structure very quickly. For many common graph structures like paths, stars, or regular graphs, the process terminates in O(1) steps.

    Constructing a graph that survives for many steps is not straightforward. A vertex 'u' survives longer if its neighbors have much higher degrees. However, these high-degree neighbors are themselves highly unstable because they are likely to be local maxima relative to their other neighbors (especially in a forest, where high-degree nodes are sparse and often connected to many low-degree nodes/leaves). This instability seems to propagate through any complex structure, leading to a rapid collapse.

    Based on this analysis, the process terminates in a constant number of steps, irrespective of the maximum degree of the forest. Therefore, the complexity is O(1) for all three cases.

    The categories are:
    1) f(n) = O(1)
    2) f(n) = omega(1) but O(log^0.1(log n))
    3) f(n) = omega(log^0.1(log n)) but O(log^0.9(log n))
    4) f(n) = omega(log^0.9(log n)) but O(log(log n))
    5) f(n) = omega(log(log n)) but 2^O(sqrt(log(log n)))
    6) f(n) = 2^omega(sqrt(log(log n))) but O(log^0.9(n))
    7) f(n) = omega(log^0.9(n)) but o(log n)
    8) f(n) = Theta(log n)
    9) f(n) = omega(log n)

    f1(n): Forest with max degree at most sqrt(log n). Bound is O(1). Category 1.
    f2(n): Forest with max degree at most log n. Bound is O(1). Category 1.
    f3(n): Any forest. Bound is O(1). Category 1.
