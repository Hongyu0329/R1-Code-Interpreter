# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of nondegenerate,
# locally connected components of a set F satisfying a self-similarity equation.

# Based on the analysis of the Iterated Function System (IFS) defined by the set D,
# any non-empty closed set F satisfying the equation must be disconnected.

# The set of functions can be partitioned based on the x-component of the vectors in D.
# d_x = 0 maps x-coordinates from [0,1] to [0, 1/4].
# d_x = 3 maps x-coordinates from [0,1] to [3/4, 1].
# This implies that F is composed of at least two disjoint sets, F_0 and F_3,
# residing in different vertical strips. So F has at least 2 components.

# Let's apply the same logic recursively.
# F_0 is built from applying the d_x=0 functions to F = F_0 U F_3.
# S_d(F_0) for d_x=0 has x-coordinates in [0, 1/16].
# S_d(F_3) for d_x=0 has x-coordinates in [3/16, 1/4].
# Thus F_0 is itself composed of two disjoint sets.

# Similarly, F_3 is also composed of two disjoint sets.
# In total, F is composed of at least 4 disjoint sets: F_00, F_03, F_30, F_33.
# F_00 is in the x-range [0, 1/16].
# F_03 is in the x-range [3/16, 4/16].
# F_30 is in the x-range [12/16, 13/16].
# F_33 is in the x-range [15/16, 16/16].

# This line of reasoning suggests that any such set F has at least 4 components.
# In the theory of graph-directed fractals, it is possible to construct
# an invariant set F which has exactly 4 connected components. These components
# are non-degenerate and locally connected (they are continuous arcs).

# Therefore, the smallest possible number of such components is 4.
smallest_number_of_components = 4
