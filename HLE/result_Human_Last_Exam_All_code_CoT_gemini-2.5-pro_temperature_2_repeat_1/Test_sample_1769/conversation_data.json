    "This is a fascinating question of alternate history linguistics! To figure this out, we need to find the original Old English word for \"sister\" and apply the natural sound changes that occurred in the English language over the centuries, while ignoring the influence of Old Norse.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify the current Modern English word and its actual origin.\n2.  Find the native Old English word that was replaced.\n3.  Trace the phonetic evolution of this native word through Middle English and into Modern English, using known sound change rules.\n4.  Present the final, hypothetical word.\n\nThe following Python script will walk you through this linguistic journey.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the hypothetical Modern English word for 'sister'\n    without Norse influence by tracing the evolution of the original\n    Old English word 'sweostor'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: The current word, \"sister\", comes from Old Norse \"systir\".\n    # This word replaced the native English word.\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n\n    # Step 2: The native Old English word for \"sister\" was \"sweostor\".\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n\n    print(f\"The current word '{current_word}' is a loanword from Old Norse '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"It replaced the original Old English word: '{old_english_word}'.\\n\")\n    print(\"To find the hypothetical modern word, we trace the evolution of 'sweostor'.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Evolution from Old English to Middle English.\n    # The \"sweo-\" prefix often simplified. The most common attested form\n    # in Middle English derived from 'sweostor' was 'suster'.\n    middle_english_word = \"suster\"\n\n    # Step 4: Evolution from Middle English to Modern English.\n    # The word would have been affected by the Great Vowel Shift.\n    # The short 'u' /ʊ/ (as in 'put') shifted to the 'uh' /ʌ/ sound (as in 'cup').\n    # The spelling, however, would likely have remained.\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"The historical linguistic path would have been:\")\n    # The user prompt requested to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # We will interpret this as printing each stage of the word's evolution.\n    print(f\"1. Old English form: {old_english_word}\")\n    print(f\"2. Middle English form: {middle_english_word}\")\n    print(f\"3. Hypothetical Modern English form: {hypothetical_modern_word}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Thus, without Norse influence, the Modern English word for 'sister' would most likely be '{hypothetical_modern_word}'.\")\n    print(\"This word is pronounced like 'suster' (rhymes with 'duster' or 'cluster').\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
