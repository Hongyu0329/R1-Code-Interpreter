Step-by-step derivation of the solution:

Let the set be S with cardinality |S| = \u03C9\u2084. We are looking for the maximum cardinality of a collection A of subsets of S satisfying:
1. For every subset 'a' in A, its cardinality is |a| = \u03C9\u2084.
2. For every distinct pair of subsets 'a' and 'b' in A, the cardinality of their intersection is |a \u2229 b| < \u03C9\u2084.

The problem states that we can suppose 2^(\u03C9\u2083) = \u03C9\u2084. We will see that this assumption is not necessary for the result.

Let \u03BA = \u03C9\u2084. The problem asks for the maximum size of a family of subsets of \u03BA, where each subset has size \u03BA, and pairwise intersections have size less than \u03BA.

Part 1: Establishing a lower bound for |A|.

We can construct such a family A with size \u03C9\u2084. This shows that the answer is at least \u03C9\u2084.
Let's consider the set X = \u03C9\u2084 \u00D7 \u03C9\u2084. The cardinality of X is |X| = \u03C9\u2084 \u00D7 \u03C9\u2084 = \u03C9\u2084. We can identify X with S.
For each ordinal \u03B1 < \u03C9\u2084, define the set a_\u03B1 = {(\u03B1, \u03B2) | \u03B2 < \u03C9\u2084}.
Let A = {a_\u03B1 | \u03B1 < \u03C9\u2084}.
Let's check the properties:
- The size of the family is |A| = \u03C9\u2084.
- For each a_\u03B1 in A, |a_\u03B1| = \u03C9\u2084.
- For any two distinct sets a_\u03B1 and a_\u03B3 in A (where \u03B1 \u2260 \u03B3), their intersection is a_\u03B1 \u2229 a_\u03B3 = \u2205 (the empty set).
- The cardinality of the intersection is |a_\u03B1 \u2229 a_\u03B3| = 0, which is less than \u03C9\u2084.
So, a family of size \u03C9\u2084 is guaranteed to exist.

Part 2: Establishing an upper bound for |A|.

This is a classic result in combinatorial set theory. We will prove that |A| cannot be greater than \u03C9\u2084.
The proof works for any regular cardinal \u03BA. Since \u03C9\u2084 = \u2135\u2084, which is the successor of \u2135\u2083, it is a regular cardinal.
Assume, for contradiction, that there is such a family A with |A| \u2265 (\u03C9\u2084)^+ = \u03C9\u2085.
Let's take a subfamily of size \u03C9\u2085, which we will also call A = {a_\u03B1 | \u03B1 < \u03C9\u2085}.
Each a_\u03B1 is a subset of \u03C9\u2084 of size \u03C9\u2084.
For any \u03B1 \u2260 \u03B2, |a_\u03B1 \u2229 a_\u03B2| < \u03C9\u2084. Since \u03C9\u2084 is a regular cardinal, any subset of it with cardinality less than \u03C9\u2084 is bounded. Thus, for any \u03B1 \u2260 \u03B2, sup(a_\u03B1 \u2229 a_\u03B2) is an ordinal less than \u03C9\u2084.

We can define a coloring function c on pairs of ordinals from \u03C9\u2085: c({ \u03B1, \u03B2 }) = sup(a_\u03B1 \u2229 a_\u03B2). The range of c is a subset of \u03C9\u2084.
By a theorem of Hajnal (related to Erd\u0151s-Rado partition calculus), for a function from [\u03BA^+]^2 to \u03BA, there is a subset H \u2286 \u03BA^+ of size \u03BA^+ on which the function is "almost constant". More precisely, there exists H \u2286 \u03C9\u2085 with |H| = \u03C9\u2085 and an ordinal \u03B3 < \u03C9\u2084 such that for all distinct \u03B1, \u03B2 \u2208 H, we have c({\u03B1, \u03B2}) < \u03B3.
This implies that for all distinct \u03B1, \u03B2 \u2208 H, their intersection a_\u03B1 \u2229 a_\u03B2 is a subset of \u03B3.

Now, for each \u03B1 \u2208 H, define b_\u03B1 = a_\u03B1 \u2216 \u03B3.
These sets {b_\u03B1 | \u03B1 \u2208 H} are pairwise disjoint.
The cardinality of each b_\u03B1 is |b_\u03B1| = |a_\u03B1 \u2216 \u03B3| = \u03C9\u2084, because |a_\u03B1| = \u03C9\u2084 and |\u03B3| < \u03C9\u2084.
So we have a family of \u03C9\u2085 pairwise disjoint subsets of \u03C9\u2084, each of size \u03C9\u2084.
The union of these sets has cardinality \u03C9\u2085 \u00D7 \u03C9\u2084 = \u03C9\u2085.
But this union is a subset of \u03C9\u2084 \u2216 \u03B3, whose cardinality is \u03C9\u2084.
This implies \u03C9\u2085 \u2264 \u03C9\u2084, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, the initial assumption that |A| > \u03C9\u2084 must be false. So, |A| \u2264 \u03C9\u2084.

Conclusion:

From Part 1, we know |A| \u2265 \u03C9\u2084.
From Part 2, we know |A| \u2264 \u03C9\u2084.
Combining these, the largest possible cardinality is exactly \u03C9\u2084.

The final equation is: The largest cardinality |A| = \u03C9\u2084.
The number in this final equation is 4.
The final answer is \u03C9\u2084.
