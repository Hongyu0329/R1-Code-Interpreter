    This problem asks to identify the types of points on the Berkovich projective line
    that are part of a specific subset defined by an equivalence relation on C_p^x * C_p.

    1. The problem defines a space and an equivalence relation on it. This construction is a known model for the p-adic upper half-plane, which is a fundamental object in p-adic geometry. The standard reference frame for classifying points in this context is the Berkovich line over Q_p.

    2. The types of points on the Berkovich projective line over Q_p are:
        - Type 1: The classical points P^1(Q_p).
        - Type 2: Corresponds to disks with radii in the value group of Q_p (i.e., integer powers of p).
        - Type 3: Corresponds to disks with radii not in the value group of Q_p.
        - Type 4: Corresponds to certain nested sequences of disks with an empty intersection.

    3. We can show that Type 1 points are excluded. An equivalence class in the given space is not a single point but a larger set. For example, the equivalence class of (1, 0) corresponds to the entire unit disk D(0, 1) in A^1(C_p). A disk is a Type 2 point, not a Type 1 point. Since a class corresponds to something 'larger' than a single point, Type 1 points are not in the image.

    4. The space constructed by the equivalence relation is known in the literature (e.g., Drinfeld's p-adic symmetric spaces) to be identifiable with the subset of the Berkovich projective line over Q_p that *excludes* precisely the Type 1 points over Q_p. This space is P^1_{Berk, Q_p} \ P^1(Q_p).

    5. Therefore, the points included are all types *except* Type 1. These are Types 2, 3, and 4.
