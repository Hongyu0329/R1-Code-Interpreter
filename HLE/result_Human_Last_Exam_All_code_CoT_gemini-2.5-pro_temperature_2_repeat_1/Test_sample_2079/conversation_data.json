    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a historical question that requires retrieving a specific fact from a knowledge base rather than performing a calculation. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  I will access my historical knowledge base to find the name of the judge who presided over the town of Bártfa (modern-day Bardejov) in the year 1461.\n2.  I will then present this information using a Python script, as requested. The script will simply use a `print` function to display the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa_1461():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    This information is based on historical records.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 1461\n    city = \"Bártfa (Bardejov)\"\n    judge_name = \"Jakub\"\n\n    print(f\"The judge of {city} in {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nfind_judge_of_bartfa_1461()\n```\n<<<Jakub>>>"
