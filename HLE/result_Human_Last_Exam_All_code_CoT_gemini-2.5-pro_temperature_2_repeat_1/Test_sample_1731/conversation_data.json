    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Theoretical Basis:** The problem will be solved using the principles of statistical mechanics for a Bose-Einstein gas. The equilibrium state of a system is the macrostate with the highest number of corresponding microstates, which is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy. Large deviation theorems, such as the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, provide a rigorous mathematical justification for this principle of maximum entropy, by showing that the probability of the system being in a state significantly different from the maximum entropy state is exponentially small.\n2.  **System Specification:** We consider a gas of photons in a volume V at temperature T. Photons are bosons, so they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. A key property of a photon gas is that the number of photons is not conserved, which implies that their chemical potential is zero.\n3.  **Derivation of Mean Energy (E):** We will start from the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average number of photons in a given energy state. By integrating the energy of photons over all possible energy states, weighted by the photon density of states, we can calculate the total mean energy of the system. This calculation involves a standard integral related to the Riemann-Zeta function.\n4.  **Derivation of Entropy (S):** Once the mean energy (E) is determined, the entropy (S) can be found using the fundamental thermodynamic relationship for a photon gas. For an ultra-relativistic gas like photons, the energy and pressure are related by E = 3PV. Since the chemical potential is zero, the Euler relation E + PV - TS = 0 simplifies to TS = E + PV = E + E/3 = 4E/3. This allows for a straightforward calculation of S once E is known.\n5.  **Final Output:** The Python script will walk through these steps, explaining the formulas and presenting the final equations for E and S. The code will print each component of the final equations to be clear.\n\nHere is the Python script to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the derivation and presents the equilibrium values for\n    mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (Bose case for light quanta) based\n    on statistical mechanics, whose foundational principles are supported by\n    large deviation theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Theoretical Framework ---\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium state of the photon gas is the state of maximum entropy.\")\n    print(\"This is justified by Large Deviation Theory, which states that deviations\")\n    print(\"from this state are exponentially improbable.\\n\")\n    print(\"For a gas of photons (bosons with non-conserved number), the chemical potential is 0.\")\n    print(\"The average number of photons n(e) in an energy state 'e' is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution:\")\n    print(\"  <n(e)> / g(e) = 1 / (exp(e / (k_B * T)) - 1)\")\n    print(\"where g(e) is the density of states, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.\\n\")\n    print(\"The density of states g(e) for photons in a volume V is:\")\n    print(\"  g(e)de = (8 * pi * V / (h^3 * c^3)) * e^2 de\\n\")\n\n    # --- Mean Energy Calculation ---\n    print(\"--- 1.
