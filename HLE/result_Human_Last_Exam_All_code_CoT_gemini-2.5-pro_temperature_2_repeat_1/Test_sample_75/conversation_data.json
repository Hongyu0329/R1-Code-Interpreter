    "Here is the plan to calculate the duration of the Second Great War:\n\n1.  **Establish Start and End Dates:** I will define the start year (2504) and the end year (2508) of the Second Great War according to StarCraft lore.\n2.  **Calculate the Duration:** I will subtract the start year from the end year to get the total duration.\n3.  **Round Up:** Since the duration is exactly 4 years, rounding it up results in the same number.\n4.  **Display the Calculation:** I will print a sentence that clearly shows the numbers used in the subtraction to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in 2504\n# and concluded with the epilogue campaign of Legacy of the Void in 2508.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration of the war\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The result is a whole number, but we use math.ceil to adhere to the \"round up\" instruction.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Output the equation and the final answer\nprint(f\"The Second Great War started in {start_year} and ended in {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"The total duration is calculated as: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration} years.\")\nprint(f\"Rounding up, the war lasted for {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
