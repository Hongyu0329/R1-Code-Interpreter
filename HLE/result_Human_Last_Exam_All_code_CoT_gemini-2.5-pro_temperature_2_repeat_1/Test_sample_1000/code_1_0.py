# Define the dimensions from the problem description
n = 2023  # Dimension of the total vector space V = F_p^n
k = 2000  # Dimension of the subspaces in the set X

# The problem is to find the smallest size of a subset Y of X such that
# for any V in X, the sum of intersections of V with each W in Y equals V.
# This is a known problem in finite geometry. The minimal size of such a set Y
# is given by the formula n - k + 1, provided 2 <= k <= n - 2.

# We check the conditions:
# 2 <= 2000 is true.
# 2000 <= 2023 - 2 = 2021 is true.
# Since the conditions hold, we can apply the formula.

# Calculate the result
result = n - k + 1

# Output the explanation and the final answer
