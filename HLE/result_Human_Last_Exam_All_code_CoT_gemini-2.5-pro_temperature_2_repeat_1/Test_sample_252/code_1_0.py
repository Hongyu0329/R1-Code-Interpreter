    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for CTIS.

    In Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), the goal is to reconstruct
    a 3D spectral data cube (2 spatial dimensions, 1 spectral dimension)
    from a single 2D image.

    The reconstruction requires a set of 2D projections. A single 1D diffraction
    grating only disperses light along one axis, which is insufficient. To create
    the necessary 2D pattern of dispersed images (projections) on the detector,
    we must disperse light in two orthogonal directions.
