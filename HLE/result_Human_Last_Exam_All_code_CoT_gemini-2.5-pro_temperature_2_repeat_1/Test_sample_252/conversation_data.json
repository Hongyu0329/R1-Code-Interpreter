    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The goal is to build a 3D data \"cube\" or \"spectral volume\" (with two spatial dimensions, `x` and `y`, and one spectral dimension, `λ` for wavelength) from a single 2D image captured by a detector.\n2.  **Understand the Tool:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits light into its constituent wavelengths. A standard \"1D\" grating disperses light along a single line or axis.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Computed Tomography\" Aspect:** The core idea of tomography is to reconstruct a volume from a series of projections. In medical CT, these are X-ray images taken from different angles. In CTIS, the different \"projections\" are the multiple, spectrally-dispersed images of the scene created by the grating(s) on the 2D detector.\n4.  **Connect the Pieces:**\n    *   A single point of light entering the system must be projected onto the 2D detector as a pattern that contains information about its wavelength.\n    *   If we use only one 1D diffraction grating, it will disperse the light along a single line. This creates a series of 1D projections, which is not enough information to uniquely reconstruct the 3D data cube. There will be ambiguity between spatial and spectral information.\n    *   To solve this, we need to disperse the light in two orthogonal directions (e.g., horizontally and vertically). This creates a 2D pattern of diffracted orders on the detector. This 2D pattern provides the necessary set of \"projections\" to tomographically reconstruct the full (x, y, λ) data cube without ambiguity.\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Number:** To achieve dispersion in two orthogonal directions, the simplest method is to use two 1D diffraction gratings placed at a 90-degree angle to each other. This component is often called a \"crossed grating.\" Therefore, the minimum number of gratings required is two.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this logic by calculating the number of gratings required based on the number of dispersion axes needed.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for CTIS.\n\n    In Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), the goal is to reconstruct\n    a 3D spectral data cube (2 spatial dimensions, 1 spectral dimension)\n    from a single 2D image.\n\n    The reconstruction requires a set of 2D projections.
