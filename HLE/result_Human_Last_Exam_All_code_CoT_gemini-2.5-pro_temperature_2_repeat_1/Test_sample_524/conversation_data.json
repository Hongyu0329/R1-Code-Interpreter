    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to know the number of distinct \"types\" (homeomorphism classes) of a specific mathematical object: homogeneous planar continua. The request also requires the answer to be presented as a Python script that calculates and prints the result as a simple equation.\n2.  **Consult Mathematical Knowledge:** This question refers to a famous result in the field of point-set topology. A \"continuum\" is a compact, connected metric space. \"Planar\" means it can be drawn in the 2D plane without self-intersection. \"Homogeneous\" means the space looks the same from every point.\n3.  **Identify the Key Theorem:** The classification of homogeneous planar continua is a result established through the work of several prominent mathematicians, including R. H. Bing, F. Burton Jones, and James T. Rogers, Jr. The final theorem states that any such object belongs to one of exactly two categories:\n    *   The object separates the plane (like a circle creates an inside and an outside). There is only **1** such type: the **circle**.\n    *   The object does not separate the plane. There is only **1** such type: the **pseudo-arc**.\n4.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The total number of classes is the sum of the classes from the separating and non-separating cases. Therefore, the calculation is a simple addition: `1 + 1`.\n5.  **Generate the Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script that defines variables for the number of classes in each category, adds them together, and prints the equation and the final result as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the number of homeomorphism classes\n    of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n    This is based on a major theorem in topology. The theorem classifies these\n    mathematical objects into two distinct types based on whether they\n    separate the plane.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the classification theorem by Bing, Jones, and Rogers:\n    # There is exactly one type of homogeneous planar continuum that separates\n    # the plane. This is the simple closed curve, or circle.\n    num_separating_types = 1\n\n    # There is also exactly one type of homogeneous planar continuum that\n    # does not separate the plane. This is the pseudo-arc.\n    num_non_separating_types = 1\n\n    # The total number of homeomorphism classes is the sum of these two mutually\n    # exclusive categories.\n    total_classes = num_separating_types + num_non_separating_types\n\n    print(\"The total number of homeomorphism classes for homogeneous planar continua is the sum of the separating and non-separating types.\")\n    print(\"Equation: (Number of separating types) + (Number of non-separating types)\")\n    print(f\"Result: {num_separating_types} + {num_non_separating_types} = {total_classes}\")\n\nsolve_homeomorphism_classes()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
