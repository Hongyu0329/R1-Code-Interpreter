    print("This script provides a proof for a problem in random walk theory.")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------")

    print("\nStep 1: Formalize the problem.")
    print("Let S be a simple random walk on the lattice Z^d, for d >= 3.")
    print("Let A be a subset of Z^d.")
    print("The hitting time of A is tau_A = min{n >= 1: S_n is in A}.")
    print("The hitting probability of A starting from x is h_A(x) = P_x(tau_A < infinity).")
    print("The problem assumes that P_x(tau_A < infinity) = 1 for infinitely many points x in Z^d.")
    print("Question: Can A be a transient set?")
    print("A set A is transient if the walk, starting at the origin, visits A only a finite number of times almost surely.")
    print("Mathematically, A is transient if P_0(Number of visits to A < infinity) = 1.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyze the hitting probability function h_A(x).")
    print("The function h_A(x) is known to have the following properties:")
    print("  a) It is bounded: 0 <= h_A(x) <= 1 for all x.")
    print("  b) It equals 1 on the set A: h_A(x) = 1 for all x in A.")
    print("  c) It is a discrete harmonic function on the domain Z^d \\ A.")
    print("The problem's condition means that there is an infinite set X where h_A(x) = 1 for all x in X.")

    print("\nStep 3: Deduce the behavior of h_A(x) at infinity.")
    print("Since X is an infinite set, we can find a sequence of points x_n in X such that |x_n| goes to infinity.")
    print("For this sequence, h_A(x_n) = 1. Since h_A(x) is bounded by 1, this implies that the limit superior of h_A(x) as |x| goes to infinity is at least 1.")
    print("So, we have: limsup_{|x|->inf} h_A(x) >= 1.")
    print("Combining this with property (a), h_A(x) <= 1, we must have lim_{|x|->inf} h_A(x) = 1.")

    print("\nStep 4: Prove that h_A(x) must be identically equal to 1.")
    print("Let's define a new function v(x) = 1 - h_A(x).")
    print("This function v(x) is non-negative, bounded, and harmonic on Z^d \\ A.")
    print("Furthermore, v(x) = 0 for all x in A, and from Step 3, lim_{|x|->inf} v(x) = 0.")
    print("By the minimum principle for non-negative harmonic functions on exterior domains in Z^d (d>=3), a function that is zero on the boundary (A) and at infinity must be zero everywhere on its domain of harmonicity.")
    print("Therefore, v(x) = 0 for all x in Z^d \\ A. This gives the equation 1 - h_A(x) = 0.")
    print("This implies h_A(x) = 1 for all x not in A. Since we already know h_A(x) = 1 for x in A, we conclude h_A(x) = 1 for ALL x in Z^d.")

    print("\nStep 5: Analyze the consequence for the number of visits to A.")
    print("Let's see what h_A(x) = 1 implies for the walk's behavior.")
    print("The probability that the walk starting from the origin ever hits A is h_A(0). We've shown this probability is 1.")
    print("Once the walk hits A at some point y, what is the probability of it hitting A again?")
    print("This return probability is given by P_y(tau_A^+ < infinity), where tau_A^+ is the hitting time starting from n=1.")
    print("Using the Strong Markov Property: P_y(tau_A^+ < infinity) = E_y[h_A(S_1)].")
    print("Since h_A(z) = 1 for all points z, the expectation is E_y[1].")
    print("This leads to the equation: E_y[1] = 1.")
    print("So, the probability of returning to A is 1.")
    print("By induction, if the walk has visited A k times, it is certain to visit it a (k+1)-th time.")
    print("This means the walk visits A infinitely many times almost surely.")
    print("So, P_0(Number of visits to A = infinity) = 1.")

    print("\nStep 6: Final Conclusion.")
    print("The definition of a transient set is that P_0(Number of visits to A < infinity) = 1.")
    print("Our deduction shows that P_0(Number of visits to A < infinity) = 0.")
    print("This is a direct contradiction. Thus, the set A cannot be transient.")
    print("\nFinal Answer: No.")
