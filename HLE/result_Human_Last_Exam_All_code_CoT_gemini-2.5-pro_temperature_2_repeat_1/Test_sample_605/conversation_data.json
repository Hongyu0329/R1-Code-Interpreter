    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the defining parameters**: The Calabi-Yau manifold is given as a hypersurface in a weighted projective space. The crucial information is the set of weights for the ambient space, which are `W = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the hypersurface**: For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space to be a Calabi-Yau manifold, its weighted degree `d` must equal the sum of the weights of the ambient space. We will calculate `d = Σ w_i`. The polynomial provided seems to have a small typo in one term's degree, but the definition of a Calabi-Yau manifold in this context fixes the degree to be the sum of weights.\n\n3.  **Identify the formula for the invariant**: The \"Crawley-Nordström invariant\" in this context refers to a specific topological invariant of the manifold, which can be identified with the second Chern number, commonly denoted as `c₂(X) ⋅ H`. For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface `X` defined by a polynomial of degree `d` in a well-formed weighted projective space `P(w₁, w₂, w₃, w₄, w₅)`, this invariant is calculated with the formula:\n    `Invariant = d * Σ_{i<j} wᵢ wⱼ`\n    where `i` and `j` range from 1 to 5.\n\n4.  **Calculate the components**:\n    *   Calculate `d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75`.\n    *   Calculate the sum of the pairwise products of the weights, `Σ_{i<j} wᵢ wⱼ`.\n    *   Compute the final result by multiplying these two values.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python script**: The script will perform these calculations and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface\n    in a weighted projective space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient projective space P(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    \n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree 'd' of the defining polynomial\n    # is the sum of the weights.\n    d = sum(weights)\n    \n    # The invariant is given by the formula: d * sum(w_i * w_j for i < j).\n    # We calculate the sum of pairwise products of the weights.\n    sum_of_pairwise_products = 0\n    for i, j in itertools.combinations(range(len(weights)), 2):\n        sum_of_pairwise_products += weights[i] * weights[j]\n        \n    # The final invariant is the product of the degree and the sum of pairwise products.\n    invariant = d * sum_of_pairwise_products\n    \n    # Output the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The weights are: {weights}\")\n    print(f\"The degree of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface is d = sum(weights) = {d}\")\n    print(f\"The sum of pairwise products of weights is sum(w_i*w_j) = {sum_of_pairwise_products}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe Crawley-Nordstrom invariant is d * sum(w_i*w_j).\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{d} * {sum_of_pairwise_products} = {invariant}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<4362075>>>"
