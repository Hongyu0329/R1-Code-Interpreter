    "This sequence follows the order of the letters on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\n1.  **Identify the Keyboard Row**: The bottom row of letters on a QWERTY keyboard is Z, X, C, V, B, N, M.\n2.  **Analyze the Sequence**: The provided sequence is `ZXXCVYBN_`. If we ignore the second 'X' and the 'Y' which break the pattern, the core sequence is Z, X, C, V, B, N.\n3.  **Determine the Next Letter**: The pattern consists of simply moving one key to the right on the bottom row of the keyboard. After 'N', the next key is 'M'.\n\nThe python code below demonstrates finding the next letter based on this logic.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_letter():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the sequence puzzle by assuming it follows the\n    bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The full bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard\n    keyboard_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n    \n    # The core pattern recognized from the user's sequence\n    sequence_base = \"ZXCVBN\"\n    \n    print(f\"The sequence is based on the keyboard row: {', '.join(list(keyboard_row))}\")\n    print(f\"The core sequence identified is: {', '.join(list(sequence_base))}\")\n    \n    # Find the last letter from our identified sequence\n    last_letter = sequence_base[-1]\n    \n    # Find the index of this letter in the full keyboard row\n    try:\n        index_of_last = keyboard_row.find(last_letter)\n        \n        # Determine the next letter if it exists\n        if index_of_last < len(keyboard_row) - 1:\n            next_letter = keyboard_row[index_of_last + 1]\n            print(f\"The letter after '{last_letter}' in the row is '{next_letter}'.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"The sequence is already at the end of the keyboard row.\")\n            \n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"A letter in the sequence was not found on the keyboard row.\")\n\nfind_next_letter()\n```\n<<<M>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
