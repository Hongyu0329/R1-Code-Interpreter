# The problem is a question in advanced topology (descriptive set theory).
# The space P(X) can be shown to be a perfect Polish space. A Polish space is a
# separable completely metrizable topological space. A perfect space has no isolated points.
# By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of countably many open dense subsets of
# a complete metric space is a dense G-delta set.
# A key theorem of descriptive set theory states that any dense G-delta subset of a
# perfect Polish space is also a perfect Polish space.
# Any non-empty perfect Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum.
# The symbol for the cardinality of the continuum is 'c'.

answer = 'c'
