    "Here's my plan to solve this sequence problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the sequence for patterns.** The sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. It's not a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence. I'll look for other types of patterns.\n2.  **Break the sequence into parts.** I notice the sequence seems to have a \"head\" and a \"tail\". The tail consists of runs of identical numbers (`3,3,3` and `2,2`).\n3.  **Identify the rule for the tail.** The tail seems to follow a rule where blocks of a repeating digit `k` appear. For `k=3`, we see `3,3,3`. For `k=2`, we see `2,2`.\n4.  **Formulate a hypothesis.** Let's assume the starting part of the sequence is `3, 2, 1, 2`. After this prefix, the sequence is made of blocks of `k, k, k` for `k=3, 2, 1, ...` in descending order.\n5.  **Test the hypothesis against the given sequence.**\n    *   Prefix: `3, 2, 1, 2`.\n    *   Block for `k=3`: `3, 3, 3`. Concatenating gives `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3`. This matches the beginning of the given sequence.\n    *   Block for `k=2`: `2, 2, 2`. If we append this, we would have `... 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2`.\n6.  **Compare with the provided sequence.** The given sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. It's missing the last `2` from the `k=2` block.\n7.  **Determine the next elements.**\n    *   The very next element must be `2` to complete the block of three `2`s.\n    *   After the `k=2` block (`2,2,2`) is complete, the rule dictates we move to the `k=1` block, which is `1,1,1`.\n    *   So, the next four elements will be the `2` to finish the current block, followed by the first three elements of the next block, which are `1, 1, 1`.\n8.  **Final Answer.** The next four elements are `2, 1, 1, 1`.\n9.  **Write the code.** The code will implement this logic to generate the full sequence and print the required part of the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the sequence puzzle based on the identified pattern.\n    The pattern is a prefix '3, 2, 1, 2' followed by blocks of repeating digits.\n    Each block consists of a digit 'k' repeated 3 times, for k=3, 2, 1, ...\n    \"\"\"\n    prefix = [3, 2, 1, 2]\n    \n    # The given sequence from the problem\n    given_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n    \n    # Generate the full sequence based on the rule\n    generated_sequence = list(prefix)\n    for k in range(3, 0, -1): # k will be 3, 2, 1\n        block = [k] * 3\n        generated_sequence.extend(block)\n        \n    # The next 4 elements are the ones in the generated sequence right after the given sequence ends\n    start_index = len(given_sequence)\n    next_four_elements = generated_sequence[start_index : start_index + 4]\n    \n    print(\"The given sequence is: \" + \" \".join(map(str, given_sequence)))\n    print(\"The rule is a prefix '3 2 1 2' followed by blocks of k, repeated 3 times, for k=3, 2, 1...\")\n    print(\"The block for k=3 is '3 3 3'.
