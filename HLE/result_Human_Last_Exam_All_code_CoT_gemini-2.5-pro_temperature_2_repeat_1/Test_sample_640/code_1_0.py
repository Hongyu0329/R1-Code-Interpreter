    Analyzes five statements about two-channel quantum scattering.

    The core logic is based on the equivalence of the "nontrivially coupled"
    property between the potential V(r), the S-matrix S(E), and the Jost matrix F(E).
    V_NTC <=> S_NTC <=> F_NTC.

    # Statement 1: A nontrivially coupled S(E) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled V(r).
    # Logic: S_NTC => V_NTC. This is the contrapositive of (V_TC => S_TC).
    # Since a trivially coupled potential decouples the system, leading to a
    # trivially coupled S-matrix, this statement is correct.
    results.append(True)

    # Statement 2: A diagonal S(E) corresponds to a diagonal V(r).
    # Logic: A diagonal S(E) is a special case of a TC S-matrix.
    # S_TC => V_TC. So V(r) can be written as V = U*D*U_dagger.
    # For S = U*S_tilde*U_dagger to be diagonal (when S_tilde is diagonal),
    # the constant matrix U must be a (permuted) diagonal matrix (barring degeneracy).
    # This implies V(r) itself must be diagonal. The statement is correct.
    results.append(True)

    # Statement 3: A nontrivially coupled V(r) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled F(E).
    # Logic: V_NTC => F_NTC. This is the contrapositive of (F_TC => V_TC).
    # F_TC => S_TC (via the relation S = F*(F^*)^{-1}) => V_TC.
    # The chain holds, so the statement is correct.
    results.append(True)

    # Statement 4: A nontrivially coupled F(E) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled S(E).
    # Logic: F_NTC => S_NTC. This is the contrapositive of (S_TC => F_TC).
    # As established, F_TC <=> S_TC.
    # So this statement is correct.
    results.append(True)

    # Statement 5: There exist nontrivially coupled V(r) with diagonal F(E).
    # Logic: A diagonal F(E) is trivially coupled (F_TC).
    # F_TC => V_TC. This contradicts the premise that V(r) is nontrivially coupled.
