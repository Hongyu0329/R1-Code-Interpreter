    "The problem asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the set `[1, N]` under the divisibility relation, where `N = 823564528378596`.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem**: The phrasing \"in [1, N] in the divisor poset\" is slightly ambiguous. It could mean the poset of all integers up to `N`, or the poset formed by just the divisors of `N`. The highly specific structure of the number `N` strongly suggests that the problem is about its divisor poset, `D(N)`. This is a common setup in combinatorial problems. Under this interpretation, \"[1, N]\" simply specifies the range where these divisors lie, with `N` being the largest element.\n\n2.  **Analyze N**: The first step is to find the prime factorization of `N`. This will reveal the structure of its divisor poset. I will perform this factorization to show that `N` is of the form `p1^a * p2^b`.\n\n3.  **Model the Poset**: The divisor poset `D(p1^a * p2^b)` is isomorphic to the product of two chains, `C_{a+1} x C_{b+1}`. An element in this poset corresponds to a divisor `p1^i * p2^j` and can be represented by a coordinate pair `(i, j)`. This poset is a graded poset, where the rank of an element `(i, j)` is `i + j`.\n\n4.  **Apply Greene's Theorem**: For such a graded poset, the sets of elements with the same rank form a natural partition into antichains. A key result in poset theory, Greene's Theorem, implies that the largest union of `k` antichains is the sum of the sizes of the `k` largest rank levels (which are themselves antichains).\n\n5.  **Calculate and Sum**: I will write a Python script to:\n    a. Determine the exponents in the prime factorization of `N`.\n    b. Calculate the size of each rank level by counting how many pairs `(i, j)` sum to each possible rank.\n    c. Identify the 20 largest rank level sizes.\n    d. Sum these 20 sizes to get the final answer and print the corresponding equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the size of the largest union of 20 antichains\n    in the divisor poset of N = 823564528378596.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 823564528378596\n    k = 20\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze N and Model the Poset\n    # The number N has a specific prime factorization which is key to solving the problem.\n    # Let's find the exponents of its prime factors.\n    # N = 823564528378596 = 2^2 * 3^30\n    # This can be verified: 4 * (3**30) == N\n    exponents = [2, 30]\n\n    # The divisor poset D(N) is isomorphic to the product of chains C_{e_i+1},\n    # where e_i are the exponents.
