    "My plan to determine the Galois group is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Field Extension**: I will start by identifying the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the extension field $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. I'll break down the extension into a tower of fields: $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$, where $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Degree**: I will calculate the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$. This is done by finding $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ and $[L:K]$. The degree of the Galois group must be equal to the degree of the extension. $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. I will show that $[L:K]=2$ by proving that $(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is not a square in $K$. This will establish $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 8$.\n\n3.  **Establish that the Extension is Galois**: I will show that $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This proves that the extension is Galois, and we can talk about its Galois group.\n\n4.  **Determine the Group Structure**: Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. I know $|G|=8$. By analyzing the structure of the extension, I will determine properties of $G$. Specifically, I will show that:\n    a. The group $G$ is abelian.\n    b. The group $G$ contains an element of order 4.\n\n5.  **Classify the Group**: Using the classification of abelian groups of order 8, I will use the properties found in the previous step to uniquely identify the group. The abelian groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, and $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$. The properties will eliminate all but one candidate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to find the Galois Group of L/Q.\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The problem asks for the Galois group of a field extension.\n    # The definition of the field L is based on the numbers 2 and 3.\n    num1 = 2\n    num2 = 2\n    num3 = 3\n    num4 = 3\n    \n    print(\"Let L be the field extension Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\")\n    print(\"We want to find the Galois Group G = Gal(L/Q).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the structure of the extension.\")\n    print(\"Let K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
