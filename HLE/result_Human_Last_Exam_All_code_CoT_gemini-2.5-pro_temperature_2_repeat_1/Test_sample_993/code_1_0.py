    print("Step 1: Understand the goal. We need conditions that lead to LOW levels of the 18O isotope in lake sulfates.")
    print("This means the lake water itself must have low 18O levels when the sulfates formed.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the effect of evaporation on 18O levels.")
    print("Evaporation preferentially removes the lighter 16O isotope, leaving the lake water enriched (higher) in the heavier 18O isotope.")
    print("Therefore, to get low 18O, we must MINIMIZE evaporation.\n")

    print("Step 3: Analyze climate factors that minimize evaporation.")
    print(" - A 'cold' climate reduces the energy available for evaporation.")
    print(" - A 'wet' climate (implying high precipitation and humidity) replenishes the lake with 18O-depleted rainwater and reduces the evaporation rate.\n")

    print("Step 4: Analyze the effect of lake levels.")
    print(" - A 'wet' climate leads to 'high' lake levels.")
    print(" - A large, deep lake (high lake level) has a smaller surface-area-to-volume ratio, making it less susceptible to changes from evaporation compared to a shallow lake.\n")

    print("Step 5: Combine the factors.")
    print("The ideal conditions for low 18O are a WET climate (for high input of 18O-depleted water), a COLD climate (to minimize evaporation), and HIGH lake levels (to buffer against isotopic changes).")
