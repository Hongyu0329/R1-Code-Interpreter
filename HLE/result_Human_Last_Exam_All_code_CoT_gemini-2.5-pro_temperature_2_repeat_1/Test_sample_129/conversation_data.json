    "I will solve this problem by using dynamic programming. My program will calculate the number of true and false boolean expressions that can be formed for each length from 1 to 5.\n\nLet `t[k]` be the number of true expressions of length `k`.\nLet `f[k]` be the number of false expressions of length `k`.\n\nAn expression of length `k` can be formed in one of three ways:\n1.  **Binary Operation:** `A op B`, where `op` is `&` or `|`. The total length is `len(A) + len(B) + 1 = k`. We sum over all possible lengths of `A` and `B`.\n2.  **Parentheses:** `(E)`. The total length is `len(E) + 2 = k`. `E` must have length `k-2`.\n3.  **Negation:** `!E`. The total length is `len(E) + 1 = k`. `E` must have length `k-1`.\n\nThese three rules cover all possible well-formed expressions and are mutually exclusive at the top level of the expression's structure.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python code:\n1.  Initialize two arrays, `t` and `f`, of size 6 to store the counts for lengths 0 through 5.\n2.  Set the base case for length 1: `t[1] = 1` (for \"T\") and `f[1] = 1` (for \"F\").\n3.  Loop from `k = 2` to `5` to calculate the counts for each length.\n4.  Inside the loop for `k`:\n    a. Calculate contributions from binary operators (`&`, `|`) by iterating through possible sub-expression lengths `i` from 1 to `k-1`. Let `j = k - 1 - i`.\n    b. Calculate contributions from parenthesized expressions (`(E)`), which depends on counts for length `k-2`.\n    c. Calculate contributions from negated expressions (`!E`), which depends on counts for length `k-1`.\n    d. Sum these contributions to get the total `t[k]` and `f[k]`.\n5.  Finally, print the step-by-step calculations and the final answer for `t[5]`.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5\n    using dynamic programming.\n    \"\"\"\n    # t[k] = number of true expressions of length k\n    # f[k] = number of false expressions of length k\n    t = [0] * 6\n    f = [0] * 6\n\n    # Base case: k=1\n    # Expressions: \"T\" (True), \"F\" (False)\n    t[1] = 1\n    f[1] = 1\n    print(\"k=1:\")\n    print(f\"  t[1] (from 'T') = {t[1]}\")\n    print(f\"  f[1] (from 'F') = {f[1]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Dynamic programming for k = 2 to 5\n    for k in range(2, 6):\n        print(f\"k={k}:\")\n        \n        # 1.
