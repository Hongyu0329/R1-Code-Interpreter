def solve_minimum_prototypes_problem():
    """
    This function analyzes and solves for the minimum number of prototypes (M)
    needed to guarantee the classification of C class centroids.

    The problem asks for a guarantee, which means our solution must work for any
    valid configuration of the C classes and their centroids.

    Let C be the number of classes.

    --- Step 1: Prove that M >= C (Insufficiency of M < C) ---

    Let's assume we have M prototypes where M < C.
    To show this is insufficient, we can use a proof by contradiction combined
    with the pigeonhole principle, considering a k=1 nearest prototype setting.

    1. The user can choose any k for the kNN classifier. Let's choose k=1. The
       classifier then assigns a test point the soft label of its single
       nearest prototype.
    2. We have C class centroids (c_1, ..., c_C) that need to be correctly
       classified. Think of these as C "pigeons".
    3. We have M prototypes (p_1, ..., p_M). The region of space for which a
       given prototype p_j is the nearest is its Voronoi cell. Think of these
       M regions as M "pigeonholes".
    4. Since there are more pigeons (C) than pigeonholes (M), at least one
       prototype's Voronoi cell must contain at least two distinct centroids.
       Let's say prototype p_j is the nearest prototype to both centroid c_a and
       centroid c_b, where a != b.
    5. For c_a to be classified correctly, its predicted label (which is the soft
       label of p_j, s_j) must have its largest value in the a-th component.
       This means s_{ja} > s_{jb}.
    6. For c_b to be classified correctly, its predicted label (also s_j) must
       have its largest value in the b-th component. This means s_{jb} > s_{ja}.
    7. The conditions in (5) and (6) are contradictory. It is impossible for s_j
       to satisfy both.
    8. Therefore, the assumption that M < C prototypes can guarantee correct
       classification for all centroids is false. We must have M >= C.

    --- Step 2: Prove that M = C is sufficient ---

    We can prove sufficiency with a constructive example that always works.

    1. Set the number of prototypes M to be equal to C.
    2. For each class i from 1 to C, place a prototype p_i exactly at the
       location of the class centroid c_i.
    3. Determine the soft label for each prototype. The soft label s_i for p_i
       is based on its proximity to all class centroids. Since p_i is located
       at c_i, its distance to c_i is 0, while its distance to any other
       centroid c_j (j != i) is greater than 0. Any reasonable soft label
       formulation will thus assign p_i a "pure" label for class i, which is
       the one-hot vector e_i (a vector with 1 in the i-th position and 0s
       elsewhere).
    4. Configure the classifier to use k=1.
    5. To classify a centroid c_i, the classifier finds its nearest prototype.
       The distance from c_i to its corresponding prototype p_i is 0. The
       distance to any other prototype p_j is d(c_i, c_j), which is > 0.
       Therefore, p_i is the unique nearest prototype.
    6. The predicted label for c_i is the soft label of p_i, which is e_i.
    7. This label e_i has a score of 1 for class i and 0 for all other classes,
       guaranteeing a correct classification for c_i.
    8. Since this works for any i from 1 to C, this strategy is sufficient.

    --- Step 3: Conclusion ---

    We have shown that M must be at least C, and that M = C is sufficient.
    Therefore, the minimum number of prototypes required is C. The final
    equation expresses this relationship.
