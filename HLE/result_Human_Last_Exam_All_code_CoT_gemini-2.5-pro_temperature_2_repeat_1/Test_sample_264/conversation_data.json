    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Cubes' Positions:** I'll define the two cubes in a 3D coordinate system. For simplicity, let's place the first cube (Cube 1) with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and extending to (1,1,1). This means its domain is `[0, 1]` on each axis (x, y, z).\n2.  **Interpret the Shift:** The problem states the cubes are \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The main diagonal connects opposite corners, like (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). I will interpret this phrase to mean that the second cube (Cube 2) is shifted by a vector of `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This is a common and straightforward interpretation for this type of geometry puzzle. This means Cube 2 occupies the space from `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)` to `(3/2, 3/2, 3/2)`.\n3.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the volume where both cubes exist. I will find the overlapping range for each of the three axes (x, y, and z). This overlapping region will itself be a cube.\n4.  **Calculate the Volume:** I'll calculate the side length of the intersection cube from the overlapping ranges. The volume is then simply the side length cubed.\n5.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script that implements these steps and prints the calculation, including the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the properties of the cubes and the shift\ncube_side_length = 1.0\nshift_per_axis = 0.5\n\n# Define the boundaries of the two cubes\n# Cube 1: from 0 to 1 on each axis\ncube1_min = 0.0\ncube1_max = 1.0\n\n# Cube 2: shifted by 0.5 on each axis\ncube2_min = shift_per_axis\ncube2_max = cube_side_length + shift_per_axis\n\n# Find the boundaries of the intersection volume\n# The start of the intersection is the maximum of the two minimums\n# The end of the intersection is the minimum of the two maximums\nintersect_min = max(cube1_min, cube2_min)\nintersect_max = min(cube1_max, cube2_max)\n\n# Calculate the side length of the intersection cube\nintersect_side_length = intersect_max - intersect_min\n\n# Calculate the volume of the intersection\nvolume = intersect_side_length ** 3\n\n# --- Output the results step-by-step ---\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Determine the geometry of the intersection.\")\nprint(f\"Let Cube 1 be at [0, 1] on each axis.\")\nprint(f\"A shift of {shift_per_axis} along the main diagonal places Cube 2 at [{shift_per_axis}, {shift_per_axis+cube_side_length}] on each axis.\")\nprint(\"The intersection is a smaller cube defined by the overlap on each axis.\")\nprint(\"\")\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate the side length of the intersection cube.\")\nprint(f\"The overlap on any axis is from {intersect_min} to {intersect_max}.\")\nside_x = intersect_side_length\nside_y = intersect_side_length\nside_z = intersect_side_length\nprint(f\"The side length of the intersection cube is: {intersect_max} - {intersect_min} = {intersect_side_length}\")\nprint(\"\")\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate the volume of the intersection.\")\nprint(\"The volume is the product of its side lengths.\")\nprint(f\"Volume = {side_x} * {side_y} * {side_z}\")\nprint(f\"Volume = {volume}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
