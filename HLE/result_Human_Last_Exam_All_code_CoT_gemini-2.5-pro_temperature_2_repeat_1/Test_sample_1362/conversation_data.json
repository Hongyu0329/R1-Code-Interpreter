    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine which curve has good ordinary reduction above 2:\n\n1.  **Understand \"Good Reduction\":** A hyperelliptic curve defined by the equation `z^2 = P(x)` has \"good reduction\" at an odd prime `p` if the discriminant of the polynomial `P(x)` is not divisible by `p`. To have good reduction for all primes \"above 2\" (i.e., for all `p > 2`), the discriminant of `P(x)` must only contain the prime factor 2, meaning it should be a power of 2.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** We will compute the discriminant for the polynomial `P(x)` from each of the five options. Then, we will find the prime factorization of each discriminant. The curve with the \"best\" reduction properties will be the one whose discriminant has the smallest set of odd prime factors.\n\n3.  **Analyze \"Ordinary\" Property:** The term \"ordinary\" implies that the curve does not have special properties (like Complex Multiplication) that are known to cause \"supersingular\" reduction at many primes. Among the candidates with the best \"good reduction\" profile, we will select the one that is most generic. For instance, a curve defined by an irreducible polynomial is more generic than one defined by a reducible polynomial.\n\n4.  **Execute with Python:** We will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform these calculations and present the reasoning. The script will calculate the discriminant for each polynomial, factor it, and print the results to help us identify the best candidate.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef analyze_curve(label, poly_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reduction properties of a curve z^2 = P(x).\n    \n    Args:\n    label (str): The label for the curve (e.g., 'A').\n    poly_str (str): The string representation of the polynomial P(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    P = sympy.sympify(poly_str, locals={'x': x})\n    \n    print(f\"--- Analysis for Curve {label}: z^2 = {P} ---\")\n    \n    # Calculate the discriminant\n    disc = sympy.discriminant(P, x)\n    print(f\"Polynomial P(x): {P}\")\n    print(f\"Discriminant: {disc}\")\n    \n    # Factor the discriminant to find primes of bad reduction\n    if disc != 0:\n        factors = sympy.factorint(disc)\n        odd_prime_factors = {p for p in factors if p != 2 and p != -1}\n        \n        if not odd_prime_factors:\n            print(\"Primes of bad reduction (> 2): None. This curve has good reduction for all odd primes.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Primes of bad reduction (> 2): {sorted(list(odd_prime_factors))}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The polynomial has repeated roots, so the discriminant is 0.
