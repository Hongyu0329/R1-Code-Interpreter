    Calculates how many times greater the morphospecies extinction rate is
    compared to the evolutionary species extinction rate based on the problem's assumptions.

    Let's define the rates of the fundamental processes:
    - ue: The true extinction rate of an evolutionary lineage.
    - le: The branching speciation rate of an evolutionary lineage.
    - p: The rate of anagenesis (splitting a lineage into a new morphospecies).

    The problem states to assume that "all the processes that affect them occur at the same rates".
    We interpret this to mean that the rates of these three fundamental processes are equal.
    So, ue = le = p. For calculation, we can set them to a placeholder value, like 1.
