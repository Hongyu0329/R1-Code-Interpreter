    # The groupoid cardinality of the inserter Ins(F,G) between functors
    # F, G from BZ/nZ to BZ/mZ is given by the formula |Ins(F,G)| = m/n.

    # This is derived from the general formula for groupoid cardinality:
    # Cardinality = sum over isomorphism classes [x] of 1/|Aut(x)|.
    #
    # 1. The objects of the inserter are the elements of Z/mZ, so there are m objects.
    # 2. Let d = b-a. A morphism exists from h1 to h2 if h2 - h1 is in the image of the map k -> dk.
    # 3. The isomorphism classes (connected components) are the cosets of the image subgroup H = Im(k -> dk).
    #    There are m / |H| such components.
    # 4. The automorphism group Aut(h) for any object h is the kernel K of the map k -> dk.
    #    Its size |K| is the same for all objects.
    # 5. The cardinality is (number of components) / |K| = (m / |H|) / |K| = m / (|H|*|K|).
    # 6. By the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, |H|*|K| = n.
    # 7. Thus, the cardinality simplifies to m / n.

    # The values a and b are not needed for the final calculation, only n and m.
    # We must ensure the group homomorphisms are well-defined, i.e., (b-a)*n is divisible by m.
    d = b - a

        print("Warning: The provided map is not a well-defined homomorphism.")
