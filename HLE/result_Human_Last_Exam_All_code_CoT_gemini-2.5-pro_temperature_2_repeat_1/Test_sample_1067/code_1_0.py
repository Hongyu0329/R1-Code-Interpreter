    This function analyzes the logic puzzle and prints the correct answer choice.
    The goal is to find a logical statement that explains why a dog detected an intruder (P) but did not bark (¬Q).

    P: The dog detects an intruder. (True)
    Q: The dog barked. (False)
    """

    # We are looking for an explanation for the situation where P is true and Q is false.

    # Let's analyze option C:
    # P: The dog detects an intruder.
    # Q: The dog barked.
    # R: The dog was asleep.
    # Statement: [(P ∧ ¬R) → Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P), ∴ R

    # Explanation:
    # 1. The proposition `(P ∧ ¬R) → Q` states: "If the dog detects an intruder AND is not asleep, then it will bark."
    #    This is a very reasonable assumption that adds a necessary condition to the original "P → Q" rule.
    # 2. We are given the facts `P` (intruder detected) and `¬Q` (the dog did not bark).
    # 3. From `(P ∧ ¬R) → Q` and `¬Q`, we can use modus tollens to conclude `¬(P ∧ ¬R)`.
    # 4. By De Morgan's laws, `¬(P ∧ ¬R)` is equivalent to `¬P ∨ R`.
    # 5. We are given `P` is true.
    # 6. In the expression `¬P ∨ R`, since `¬P` is false, `R` must be true for the expression to hold.
    # 7. Therefore, the conclusion `R` (The dog was asleep) is logically derived.

    # This conclusion explains the entire scenario without contradicting any of the given evidence.
    # The dog was capable of barking, but didn't, because it was asleep.
