def solve_go_problem():
    """
    Analyzes the Go board position to find the best move for Black.

    The problem is a "life and death" puzzle. To capture the white group,
    Black cannot simply reduce liberties from the outside, as the white group
    has enough internal space to form two "eyes" and live.

    The key is to find the vital point of the white group's potential eye space
    and play there. This type of move is called a 'tesuji'.

    1.  White Stones: {(2, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2)} form one group.
    2.  Potential Eye Space (Liberties): {(1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2)}.
    3.  Analysis of Options:
        - Most options are on the perimeter of the eye space, which allows White
          to play in the center and easily live.
        - The move (2,4) is a 'placement' tesuji, a move deep inside the opponent's
          formation that strikes at the vital point.
    4.  The sequence initiated by B(2,4) is a sacrifice that forces White into an
        inefficient shape (a false eye) and ultimately leads to the group's capture.

    Therefore, the optimal first move is (2,4).
