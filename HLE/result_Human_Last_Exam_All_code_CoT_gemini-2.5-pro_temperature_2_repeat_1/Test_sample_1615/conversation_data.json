    "Of course, I can help you with this graph theory problem. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the key properties of the graph from the problem description: the number of vertices ($n$) and the fact that it's not a complete graph.\n2.  I will use the fundamental properties of graph coloring. The chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G)$, is at most $n$. The chromatic number is exactly $n$ if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$.\n3.  Since the graph $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This sets an upper bound on the number of colors.\n4.  To determine if this upper bound is the maximum possible value, I will demonstrate a construction of a graph that meets the problem's criteria (12345 vertices, not a complete graph) and has a chromatic number equal to this upper bound.\n5.  A simple example is a graph consisting of two disconnected components: a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and a single isolated vertex. This graph has $n$ vertices, is not a complete graph, and its chromatic number is $n-1$.\n6.  This construction proves that $n-1$ is an achievable chromatic number. Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n7.  Finally, I will write a Python script that calculates this value and prints the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph with 12345\n    vertices, given that it is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # In graph theory, the chromatic number of a graph G, denoted Chi(G), is the minimum\n    # number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n\n    # A fundamental theorem states that for any graph with n vertices, Chi(G) <= n.\n    # The equality, Chi(G) = n, holds if and only if the graph G is a complete graph (K_n),\n    # where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n    # The problem specifies that the graph G is not a complete graph.\n    # Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than n.\n    # Chi(G) < n  which means Chi(G) <= n - 1.\n\n    # This means the maximum possible number of colors is at most n - 1.\n    \n    # To confirm that n-1 is the maximum, we need to show that there exists a graph\n    # with n vertices, which is not complete, but requires n-1 colors.\n    # Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete graph on n-1 vertices (K_{n-1})\n    # and adding one more vertex as an isolated point (not connected to anything).\n    #\n    # 1. Total vertices = (n - 1) + 1 = n.\n    # 2. The graph is not a complete K_n because the isolated vertex is not connected to others.\n    # 3. The K_{n-1} part of the graph requires n-1 colors to be colored properly.\n    # 4. The single isolated vertex can be colored with any of the existing n-1 colors.\n    #\n    # The chromatic number of this constructed graph is therefore n-1.\n\n    # Since the maximum number of colors is at most n-1, and we have found a graph\n    # that requires exactly n-1 colors, the maximum is n-1.\n\n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    print(f\"Let n be the number of vertices in the graph G.
