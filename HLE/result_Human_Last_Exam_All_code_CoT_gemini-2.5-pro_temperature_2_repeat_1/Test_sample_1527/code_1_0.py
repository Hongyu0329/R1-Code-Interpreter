    Solves the geometric problem to find the value of r^2.
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1. Identify the geometric constraints. The circle with center C and radius r is
       tangent to two perpendicular lines, y = x + 1 and y = -x + 5. This means
       its center must lie on one of the angle bisectors of these lines (x=2 or y=3).
    2. Assume the second circle (center D, radius R=2) is also tangent to these
       lines, so its center also lies on a bisector. This assumption is necessary
       for the problem to have a unique solution.
    3. The two circles are tangent to each other. We analyze the possible geometric
       configurations for their centers. The most symmetric configuration, which is
       required for a well-posed problem with a single answer, is when the centers
       lie on adjacent bisector rays.
    4. For this symmetric configuration, a geometric derivation shows that the radii
       of the two circles must be equal (r = R).
    5. Given R=2, we can determine r and then calculate r^2.

    # In the symmetric configuration (centers on adjacent rays), the distance 'd'
    # between the centers C(2+sqrt(2)*r, 3) and D(2, 3+sqrt(2)*R) is given by:
    # d^2 = ( (2+sqrt(2)*r) - 2 )^2 + ( 3 - (3+sqrt(2)*R) )^2
    # d^2 = (sqrt(2)*r)^2 + (-sqrt(2)*R)^2 = 2*r^2 + 2*R^2
    
    # For the circles to be tangent, the distance between their centers must be r+R.

    # This simplifies to: r^2 - 2rR + R^2 = 0, which is (r-R)^2 = 0.
    # This proves that r must equal R.
