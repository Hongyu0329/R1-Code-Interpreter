    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions. Let's denote this number by \\(av_{n}^k(1324)\\) for \\(n=333\\) and \\(k=3\\).\n\nSince \\(n=333\\) is a large number and the number of inversions \\(k=3\\) is very small, the permutations must be \"close\" to the identity permutation \\((1, 2, ..., n)\\). The disturbances (inversions) cannot be spread too far apart, as that tends to create forbidden patterns. For example, a permutation with elements \\(a,b,c,d\\) at indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) forming the pattern \\(a < c < b < d\\) contains 1324. This structure is more likely to appear if the elements causing inversions are far from each other.\n\nThis observation suggests that the 1324-avoiding permutations with a small number of inversions are likely decomposable. A permutation \\(\\pi\\) of length \\(n\\) is decomposable if there's an integer \\(m \\in \\{1, ..., n-1\\}\\) such that the first \\(m\\) elements of \\(\\pi\\) are precisely the numbers \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\). If \\(\\pi\\) is decomposable, it can be written as a direct sum \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus \\tau\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\) and \\(\\tau\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, ..., n-m\\}\\). The permutation \\(\\pi\\) would then be \\((\\sigma_1, ..., \\sigma_m, m+\\tau_1, ..., m+\\tau_{n-m})\\).\n\nA key property is that if \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\) are 1324-avoiding, then so is \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus \\tau\\). The number of inversions in such a decomposable permutation is additive: \\(inv(\\pi) = inv(\\sigma) + inv(\\tau)\\).\n\nFor a small, fixed number of inversions \\(k\\), the number \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) becomes independent of \\(n\\) for \\(n\\) large enough. The permutations counted are essentially direct sums of shorter non-identity permutations and long identity segments.\nLet's denote \\(A_k = av_n^k(1324)\\) for large \\(n\\). We can compute \\(A_3\\) by considering how a permutation with 3 inversions can be formed from smaller 1324-avoiding components.\n\nLet \\(c_k\\) be the number of \"indecomposable\" 1324-avoiding permutations with \\(k\\) inversions. In our context, we can think of these as the essential building blocks.\n- **k=0**: The only permutation with 0 inversions is the identity, which is decomposable but serves as a base. We can define \\(c_0=1\\) for the identity of length 1.\n- **k=1**: The only permutation of length 2 with 1 inversion is (2,1). It avoids 1324 (as its length is < 4). So, \\(c_1=1\\). The permutation is \\(\\sigma=(2,1)\\).\n- **k=2**: The permutations of length 3 with 2 inversions are (2,3,1) and (3,1,2). Both avoid 1324. They are the shortest such permutations. Thus, \\(c_2=2\\). The permutations are \\(\\sigma_1=(2,3,1)\\) and \\(\\sigma_2=(3,1,2)\\).\n- **k=3**:\n    - From \\(S_3\\), the permutation (3,2,1) has 3 inversions and avoids 1324.\n    - From \\(S_4\\), there are 6 permutations with 3 inversions: 1432, 2341, 2413, 3142, 3214, 4123. We check them for the 1324 pattern. Only 1432 contains the pattern (the subsequence 1,4,3,2 itself gives \\(1 < 3 < 4 < 2\\), which matches the 1324 pattern). The other 5 permutations (2341, 2413, 3142, 3214, 4123) are 1324-avoiders.\n    Any permutation of length \\(\\ge 5\\) with 3 inversions can be shown to contain a 1324-pattern or be decomposable. So, we have \\(c_3 = 1 + 5 = 6\\) fundamental blocks.\n\nNow we can build the permutations for \\(n=333\\) with \\(k=3\\):\n\n1.  **All inversions at the beginning**: The permutation is of the form \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_{n-m}\\) where \\(\\sigma\\) is one of the \\(c_3=6\\) blocks. This gives 6 permutations.\n    (e.g., \\((3,2,1,4,5,...,333)\\))\n2.  **All inversions at the end**: The permutation is of the form \\(id_{n-m} \\oplus \\sigma\\). This gives another 6 permutations.\n    (e.g., \\((1,2,...,330,333,332,331)\\))\n3.  **Inversions split between two blocks**: The permutation is of the form \\(\\sigma_1 \\oplus id \\oplus \\sigma_2\\). The sum of inversions must be 3.\n    -   **1+2 inversions**: \\(\\sigma_1\\) has 1 inversion (\\(c_1=1\\) choice) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) has 2 inversions (\\(c_2=2\\) choices). This gives \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\) permutations.\n        (e.g., \\((2,1,3,4,...,330,332,333,331)\\))\n    -   **2+1 inversions**: \\(\\sigma_1\\) has 2 inversions (\\(c_2=2\\) choices) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) has 1 inversion (\\(c_1=1\\) choice). This gives \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) permutations.\n        (e.g., \\((2,3,1,4,5,...,332,333,331)\\) -> wrong perm example: (2,3,1) followed by ...332,333) should be (...,331,333,332). The form is `(2,3,1,4, ..., 331, 333, 332)`.\n4.  **Inversions split among three blocks**: This must be 1+1+1 inversions. The form is \\(\\sigma_1 \\oplus id \\oplus \\sigma_2 \\oplus id \\oplus \\sigma_3\\). There is only \\(c_1=1\\) choice for each \\(\\sigma_i\\). This gives \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1\\) permutation.\n    (e.g., \\((2,1,3,...,100,102,101,103,...,332,333,331)\\))\n\nTotal number of such permutations is the sum of these cases:\n\\(A_3 = 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 17\\).\n\nThe Python code below will implement this logic by calculating the counts of these compositional permutations.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n=333 with k=3 inversions.\n    For large n and small k, this number is independent of n.\n    The method is based on constructing such permutations from smaller indecomposable 1324-avoiding blocks.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # c_k: number of \"indecomposable\" 1324-avoiding permutations with k inversions.\n    # c_0: Identity permutation (length 1)\n    # c_1: (2,1)\n    c = {\n        0: 1, # Base case, identity\n        1: 1, # sigma=(2,1)\n        2: 2, # sigma=(2,3,1), (3,1,2)\n    }\n\n    # For k=3:\n    # From S_3: (3,2,1) is one such permutation.\n    # From S_4: There are 6 perms with 3 inversions.\n    # Check 1432 for 1324 pattern: 1<3<4<2, it contains the pattern.\n    # The other 5 (2341, 2413, 3142, 3214, 4123) avoid it.\n    # It can be shown that no indecomposable 1324-avoider with 3 inversions exists for length > 4.\n    c[3] = 1 + 5\n\n    k = 3\n    result = 0\n\n    # Case 1: One block of k inversions (at beginning or end)\n    # sigma oplus id_...\n    case1 = c[k]\n    # id_... oplus sigma\n    case2 = c[k]\n    result += case1 + case2\n    print(f\"Number of permutations with all 3 inversions at the beginning: {case1}\")\n    print(f\"Number of permutations with all 3 inversions at the end: {case2}\")\n\n    # Case 2: Two blocks of inversions (split k = i + (k-i))\n    # sigma_1 oplus ... oplus sigma_2\n    case3 = 0\n    for i in range(1, k // 2 + 1):\n        j = k - i\n        if i == j:\n            # If partitions are same size, say k=1+1, it's c_1 * c_1.\n            # sigma_1 oplus id oplus sigma_2.
