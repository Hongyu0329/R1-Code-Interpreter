    "My plan is to identify the character from William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who fits the user's description.\n\n1.  I will search through summaries and character analyses of the novel.\n2.  The key search term will be the reference to Romulus and Remus, specifically the imagery of a she-wolf suckling two human infants, which is the foundational myth of Rome.\n3.  My research points to the main chieftain, Thiodolf. In the book, he recounts his earlier travels, during which he visited a large Roman city.\n4.  He specifically describes seeing a bronze statue or \"image\" of a she-wolf suckling two children. This is the direct reference to Romulus and Remus the user is asking about.\n5.  I will create a Python script that prints this information as the final output.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the literary question about\n    William Morris's 'The House of the Wolfings'.\n    \"\"\"\n    character_name = \"Thiodolf\"\n    book_title = \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    myth_reference = \"Romulus and Remus\"\n    \n    print(f\"In William Morris's {book_title}, the character who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that readers will recognize as a reference to {myth_reference} is {character_name}.\")\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
