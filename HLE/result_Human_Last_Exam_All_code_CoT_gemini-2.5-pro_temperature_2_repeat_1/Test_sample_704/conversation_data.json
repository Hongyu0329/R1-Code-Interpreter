    "My plan is to solve this puzzle by first understanding the context, which is Newton's color circle and his proposed mapping of colors to musical notes.\n\n1.  **Decode the Colors:** The first step is to identify the specific colors mentioned in the question.\n    *   The \"colour produced when combining yellow and blue\" on the light spectrum is Green.\n    *   The second color is explicitly stated as \"blue\".\n    *   Therefore, the range in question is between Green and Blue.\n\n2.  **Recall Newton's Mapping:** I will use the specific mapping Sir Isaac Newton proposed between the seven colors of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale. The mapping is:\n    *   Red → C (Do)\n    *   Orange → D (Re)\n    *   Yellow → E (Mi)\n    *   Green → F (Fa)\n    *   Blue → G (Sol)\n    *   Indigo → A (La)\n    *   Violet → B (Si)\n\n3.  **Find the Corresponding Note:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range *between* Green and Blue. In Newton's model, each color band is assigned a note. The band that follows Green is Blue. The note assigned to the Blue color band is G.\n\n4.  **Code and Output:** I will write a Python script to represent this mapping and logic, ultimately printing the final note.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the musical note corresponding to the color range specified,\n    based on Isaac Newton's color circle and his proposed mapping to a musical scale.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of the seven spectral colors to the seven musical notes.\n    color_to_note_map = {\n        'Red': 'C',\n        'Orange': 'D',\n        'Yellow': 'E',\n        'Green': 'F',\n        'Blue': 'G',\n        'Indigo': 'A',\n        'Violet': 'B'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors from the user's question.\n    # The color between yellow and blue in the spectrum is green.\n    start_of_range_color = 'Green'\n    end_of_range_color = 'Blue'\n\n    # Step 3: Find the musical note for the specified range.\n    # The question asks for the note for the range between Green and Blue.\n    # In Newton's system, the color Blue follows Green.\n    # The note assigned to the color Blue is the answer.\n    start_note = color_to_note_map[start_of_range_color]\n    target_note = color_to_note_map[end_of_range_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The first color, resulting from the combination of yellow and blue in the spectrum, is Green.\")\n    print(f\"The second color is Blue.\")\n    print(f\"According to Newton's mapping, the color Green corresponds to the note {start_note}.\")\n    print(f\"The color Blue corresponds to the note {target_note}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the musical note for the range leading from Green to Blue is the note associated with Blue.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {target_note}\")\n\nsolve_newton_music_puzzle()\n```\n<<<G>>>"
