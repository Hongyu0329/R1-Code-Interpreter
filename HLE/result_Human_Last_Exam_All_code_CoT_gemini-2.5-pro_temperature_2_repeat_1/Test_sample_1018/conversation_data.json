    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the simplicial volume of the product manifold $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant mathematical formula:** The simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$, where $g, h \\ge 1$, is given by a specific formula established in the field of geometric topology. The formula is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 6(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\n2.  **Assign the given values:** In this case, we have $g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n\n3.  **Perform the calculation:** I will substitute these values into the formula to compute the result.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a simple Python script to carry out this calculation and print the full equation with the substituted values, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_product_surfaces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces.\n\n    The formula for the simplicial volume of Sigma_g x Sigma_h for g, h >= 1 is:\n    ||Sigma_g x Sigma_h|| = 6 * (g - 1) * (h - 1)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Genus of the first surface\n    g = 31\n    # Genus of the second surface\n    h = 17\n\n    # Check if the genera are valid for the formula\n    if g < 1 or h < 1:\n        print(\"The formula is valid for genera g, h >= 1.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the components of the formula\n    g_minus_1 = g - 1\n    h_minus_1 = h - 1\n\n    # Calculate the final simplicial volume\n    simplicial_volume = 6 * g_minus_1 * h_minus_1\n\n    # Print the full equation with the numerical values\n    print(f\"To compute the simplicial volume of Sigma_{g} x Sigma_{h}, we use the formula:\")\n    print(f\"||Sigma_g x Sigma_h|| = 6 * (g - 1) * (h - 1)\")\n    print(f\"Substituting g = {g} and h = {h}:\")\n    print(f\"Result = 6 * ({g} - 1) * ({h} - 1) = 6 * {g_minus_1} * {h_minus_1} = {simplicial_volume}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\ncompute_simplicial_volume_product_surfaces()\n```\n<<<2880>>>"
