    print("### Step-by-Step Explanation ###\n")

    print("Step 1: Understanding the definitions.")
    print(" - A 'continuum' is a compact, connected metric space.")
    print(" - A 'decomposable continuum' X can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., X = A U B.")
    print(" - A 'regular subcontinuum' is a subcontinuum C that equals the closure of its own interior: C = Cl(Int(C)).\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyzing the decomposition.")
    print("Let X be a nondegenerate decomposable continuum. By definition, X = A U B.")
    print("Because A and B are 'proper', they are not equal to X. Because X is connected, A and B must overlap, but neither can contain the other.")
    print("This guarantees that the sets U = A \\ B (points in A but not B) and V = B \\ A (points in B but not A) are both non-empty.\n")

    print("Step 3: Constructing candidate regular subcontinua.")
    print("Since A and B are subcontinua, they are closed sets. This means X \\ A and X \\ B are open sets.")
    print("Notice that U = A \\ B is the same as X \\ B, which means U is an open set.")
    print("Similarly, V = B \\ A is the same as X \\ A, which means V is also an open set.")
    print("Let's consider the closures of these two non-empty, disjoint, open sets: let C_1 = Cl(U) and C_2 = Cl(V).\n")

    print("Step 4: Verifying the properties of C_1 and C_2.")
    print("We must check if C_1 and C_2 are distinct regular proper subcontinua.")
    print(" - PROPER: C_1 = Cl(A \\ B) is a subset of A. Since A is a proper subcontinuum, C_1 must also be proper. The same logic applies to C_2.")
    print(" - CONTINUA: A known theorem in topology (by Z. Waraszkiewicz) states that for a decomposition X = A U B, the sets Cl(A \\ B) and Cl(B \\ A) are indeed continua.")
    print(" - REGULAR: A fundamental result in topology is that for any open set W, its closure Cl(W) is a 'regular closed set'. Since U and V are open, C_1 = Cl(U) and C_2 = Cl(V) are regular. Since we know they are also continua, they are 'regular subcontinua'.")
    print(" - DISTINCT: The sets U and V are non-empty and disjoint. Their closures, C_1 and C_2, must therefore be distinct sets.\n")

    print("Step 5: Concluding the lower bound.")
    print("The argument above shows that from any decomposition X = A U B, we can derive at least two distinct regular proper subcontinua.")
    
    number_derived_from_A = 1
    number_derived_from_B = 1
    lower_bound = number_derived_from_A + number_derived_from_B

    print(f"Number of such subcontinua derived from A's uniqueness: {number_derived_from_A}")
    print(f"Number of such subcontinua derived from B's uniqueness: {number_derived_from_B}")
    print(f"Therefore, the minimum number of such subcontinua is at least {lower_bound}.\n")
    
    print("Step 6: Achieving the lower bound.")
    print("To show that 2 is the smallest possible number, we need an example of a continuum with exactly two such subcontinua.")
    print("Topologists have constructed such continua. A standard example is joining two 'Warsaw circles' along their segment of condensation. In such a space, the two original Warsaw circles are the only two regular proper subcontinua.\n")
