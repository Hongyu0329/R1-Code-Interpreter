    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of a topological code like the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The degeneracy is given by `D = 2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store. These logical qubits correspond to pairs of non-local operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but not with each other.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the formula for `k`:\n\n1.  **Identify Sources of Logical Operators:** The number of logical operators is determined by the number of independent, non-trivial cycles on the surface, which can be of different types.\n    *   **Genus:** A surface with genus `g` (e.g., `g` handles, like a `g`-holed doughnut) has `2g` fundamental non-contractible loops. These give rise to `g` pairs of logical operators, contributing `2g` to `k`.\n    *   **Smooth Boundaries (`n` holes):** A smooth boundary is one where magnetic (`m`) excitations can terminate. This allows for logical operators made of `Z`-strings that connect two different smooth boundaries. With `n` smooth boundaries, we can form `n-1` independent logical operators of this type.\n    *   **Rough Boundaries (`m` holes):** A rough boundary is one where electric (`e`) excitations can terminate. This allows for logical operators made of `X`-strings that connect two different rough boundaries. With `m` rough boundaries, we can form `m-1` independent logical operators of this type.\n\n2.  **Combine Contributions:** Assuming we have at least one of each type of boundary (`n > 0` and `m > 0`), we can sum these contributions to find the total number of logical qubits `k`.\n    `k = (contribution from genus) + (from smooth boundaries) + (from rough boundaries)`\n    `k = 2g + (n-1) + (m-1) = 2g + n + m - 2`\n\n3.  **Determine the Genus `g`:** The problem refers to the \"toric code\". This name strongly implies that the code is defined on a torus, which is a surface with genus `g=1`. If it were on a sphere or plane (`g=0`), it is often called the \"planar code\".\n\n4.  **Calculate `k` and GSD:** By substituting `g=1` into our formula for `k`, we get:\n    `k = 2*(1) + n + m - 2 = 2 + n + m - 2 = n + m`\n    The ground space degeneracy `D` is therefore `2^k = 2^(n+m)`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_degeneracy_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and derives the formula for the ground space\n    degeneracy of the toric code on a surface with genus g, n smooth holes,\n    and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
