    print("Analyzing the relationship between the three explanations:\n")

    print("Step 1: Understand the levels of analysis for each explanation.")
    print("  - Explanation 1 ('I became afraid') is a high-level, common-sense psychological description.")
    print("  - Explanation 2 (classical conditioning) is a mid-level behavioral psychology description. It explains the 'how' of the learning process.")
    print("  - Explanation 3 (neural connectivity in the PAG) is a low-level neurobiological description. It explains the physical 'how' in the brain.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 2: Determine if the explanations are competing or complementary.")
    print("  - These explanations are not contradictory. Instead, they describe the same event at different, nested levels of detail.")
    print("  - The neural changes (3) are the physical basis for the learned association (2).")
    print("  - The learned association (2) is the scientific mechanism for the subjective experience of fear (1).")
    print("  - Therefore, they are complementary and causally linked, not competing or independent.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on this understanding.")
    print("  - A (inconsistent) is false because the explanations are consistent.")
    print("  - C (fully independent) is false because the explanations are deeply linked.")
    print("  - E (one true while another false) is highly unlikely, as the neural level is what causes the behavioral level, which causes the subjective experience.")
    print("  - F (just different jargon) is inaccurate because they are distinct levels of explanation, not just different words for the same level.")
    print("  - D correctly states that they are different hypotheses (i.e., different descriptive models) but are interconnected in such a way that if one is true, the others must also be true as descriptions of the same event at their respective levels.")
    print("\n")

    print("Conclusion: The three explanations represent different but coherent and mutually dependent levels of analysis for the same phenomenon.")
