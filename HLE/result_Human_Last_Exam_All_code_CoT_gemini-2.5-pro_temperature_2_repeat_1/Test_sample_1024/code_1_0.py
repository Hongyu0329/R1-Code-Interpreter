# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes allusion
# The lines allude to "The Adventure of the Priory School," where horses
# are fitted with special shoes to create misleading cow-like tracks.
# The "reversed shoes" would therefore properly belong to a horse.
answer_A = 7

# Part C: Nabokov's experience with back-referencing
# Nabokov's most intensive scholarly work involving annotation and
# back-referencing was his monumental translation and commentary
# on Alexander Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin."
answer_C = 7

# Part B: The connecting theme and the mathematical constraint
# The puzzle states the sum of the three answers must be a multiple of 8.
# Sum = answer_A + answer_B + answer_C
# Sum = 7 + answer_B + 7 = 14 + answer_B
# For the sum to be a multiple of 8, it must be 16, which means answer_B must be 2.
# Theme (B=2): freedom, as often symbolized by the lepidoptera.
# The Holmes story involves a kidnapping (confinement), which underscores the
# Pale Fire theme of freedom by representing its opposite.
answer_B = 2

# Calculate and print the final equation
total = answer_A + answer_B + answer_C
print(f"{answer_A} + {answer_B} + {answer_C} = {total}")
