    Calculates the critical chemical potential for scalar condensation

    The value is based on a linear interpolation of numerical results from
    the paper: Y. Brihaye and B. Hartmann, Phys. Rev. D 84, 086008 (2011).
    The model parameters are:
    - AdS5 background with Gauss-Bonnet correction.
    - Scalar field with mass m^2 L^2 = -3 (dual to operator of dimension Delta=3).
    - The calculation is done at zero temperature (T=0).

    The linear model mu_c(lambda) = m * lambda + c is fitted from the paper's data:
