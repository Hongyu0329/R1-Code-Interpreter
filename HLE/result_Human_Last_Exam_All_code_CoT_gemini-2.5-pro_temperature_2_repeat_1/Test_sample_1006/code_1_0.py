    This function calculates the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for the space X.
    
    Let X be a compact topological space such that:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.
    
    The two properties described are the defining properties of the Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted beta(R).
    
    By the universal property of the Stone-Čech compactification, beta(R) is a compact Hausdorff space
    containing R as a dense subspace, and any continuous map from R to a compact Hausdorff space K
    (like a bounded closed interval in R) can be extended uniquely to a continuous map from beta(R) to K.
    This implies that the C*-algebra of continuous functions on X, C(X), is isomorphic to the
    C*-algebra of bounded continuous functions on R, C_b(R).
    
    The Gelfand-Naimark theorem states that two compact Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic if and only if
    their C*-algebras of continuous functions are isomorphic.
    
    Since any such X must have C(X) isomorphic to C_b(R), and beta(R) also has C(beta(R)) isomorphic to
    C_b(R), it follows that C(X) is isomorphic to C(beta(R)). By Gelfand-Naimark, X must be
    homeomorphic to beta(R).
    
    The Stone-Čech compactification is unique up to homeomorphism. Therefore, all spaces X satisfying
    the given conditions belong to the same homeomorphism class.
    
    The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
