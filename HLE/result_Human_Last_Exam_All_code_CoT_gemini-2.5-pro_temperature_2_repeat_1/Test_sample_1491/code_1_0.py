# Plan:
# 1. Define a list of strings representing the answer for each capability from I to V.
# 2. The reasoning is as follows:
#    I. Goal-driven locomotion: Needed to move towards a goal in the 'cliff' and to maintain posture in the 'room'. Thus, 'both'.
#    II. Analogue of MST (optic flow processing): The 'room' experiment is entirely dependent on large-scale optic flow to create the illusion of self-motion. Thus, 'room'.
#    III. Relative size evaluation (texture gradient): This is a key monocular depth cue for perceiving the 'cliff'. Not relevant for the room. Thus, 'cliff'.
#    IV. Binocular disparity (stereopsis): A primary binocular cue for perceiving depth in the 'cliff' experiment. Not relevant for the room. Thus, 'cliff'.
#    V. Postural control effectors: The explicit dependent variable in the 'room' experiment is postural sway. Thus, 'room'.
# 3. Join the list elements with a hyphen.
# 4. Print the final resulting string.

# Step 1: Define the list of answers
answers = [
    "both",  # I. Goal-driven locomotion triggered by visual stimuli.
    "room",  # II. A functional analogue of cortical area MST in humans.
    "cliff", # III. A perceptual mechanism for evaluating the relative size of elements.
    "cliff", # IV. A mechanism for resolving binocular disparity.
    "room"   # V. A mechanism for controlling the effectors that maintain posture.
]

# Step 2 & 3: Join the list into the final hyphen-separated string
final_answer_string = "-".join(answers)

# Step 4: Print the final answer string
print(final_answer_string)

# The final answer in the requested format is directly derived from this string.
print("<<<{}>>>".format(final_answer_string))
