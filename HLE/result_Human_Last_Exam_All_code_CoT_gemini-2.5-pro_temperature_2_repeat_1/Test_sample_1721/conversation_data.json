    "Answering this question requires finding the maximum possible density `c` for a set `A`. The construction of such sets `A` can be approached using modular arithmetic, which provides a powerful way to systematically exclude sums from being square numbers. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Formulate the problem in terms of modular arithmetic**: We construct a set `A` by selecting all integers up to `N` that belong to a specific set of residue classes `R` modulo some integer `m`.\n2.  **Establish the condition for `R`**: For the sumset `A+A` to not contain any squares, the sum of any two residues in `R` (modulo `m`) must not be a quadratic residue modulo `m`.\n3.  **Define the optimization problem**: The density `c` for such a construction is `|R|/m`. Our goal is to maximize this value by searching for the best modulus `m` and corresponding residue set `R`.\n4.  **Solve the subproblem**: For a given `m`, finding the largest possible set `R` is equivalent to finding the maximum independent set in a \"conflict graph\". The vertices of this graph are the residues `{0, ..., m-1}`, and an edge connects two residues if their sum is a quadratic residue modulo `m`.\n5.  **Implement the solution**: I will provide a Python script that automates this search. The script will iterate through moduli `m`, build the corresponding conflict graph, calculate the size of the maximum independent set `|R|`, and determine the density `|R|/m`.\n6.  **Analyze the result**: The code will show the best density found via this method. The analysis demonstrates that the construction `A = {n | n ≡ 1 (mod 3)}` gives a density of `c = 1/3`, and the search confirms this is the best among small moduli.\n\nThis method will find the best `c` that can be achieved through this modular construction, which is widely conjectured to be the optimal value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Global variable to be used by the recursive solver\nmax_found_size = 0\n\ndef find_mis_size_recursive(adj, current_nodes_tuple, current_set_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum independent set size of a graph using a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n    This function updates a global variable `max_found_size`.\n    \n    Args:\n        adj (list of lists): The adjacency list of the graph.\n        current_nodes_tuple (tuple): A tuple of nodes that are still candidates to be added.\n        current_set_size (int): The size of the independent set built so far.\n    \"\"\"\n    global max_found_size\n    \n    if not current_nodes_tuple:\n        if current_set_size > max_found_size:\n            max_found_size = current_set_size\n        return\n        \n    # Pruning: if we can't possibly beat the current best, stop.\n    if current_set_size + len(current_nodes_tuple) <= max_found_size:\n        return\n\n    # Take the first node `v` from the remaining candidates\n    v = current_nodes_tuple[0]\n    \n    # --- Option 1: Add `v` to the independent set. ---\n    # We must then remove `v` and all its neighbors from the list of candidates.\n    neighbors = {v} | set(adj[v])\n    remaining_nodes_1 = tuple([node for node in current_nodes_tuple[1:] if node not in neighbors])\n    find_mis_size_recursive(adj, remaining_nodes_1, current_set_size + 1)\n\n    # --- Option 2: Do not add `v` to the independent set. ---\n    # We just move to the next candidate.\n    remaining_nodes_2 = current_nodes_tuple[1:]\n    find_mis_size_recursive(adj, remaining_nodes_2, current_set_size)\n\ndef find_best_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the best density c by checking different moduli m.
