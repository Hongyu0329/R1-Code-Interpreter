    "This is a problem in algebraic geometry, specifically concerning the moduli space of stable curves. To solve it, we will follow a plan based on established mathematical theorems.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Apply Key Theorems:** We'll use two fundamental results regarding curves whose Jacobian variety has good reduction:\n    *   **Raynaud's Theorem:** This theorem restricts the irreducible components of the stable reduction to be smooth curves of genus 0 (rational curves, like PÂ¹) or genus 1 (elliptic curves).\n    *   **Dual Graph Structure:** The condition of good reduction on the Jacobian implies that the dual graph of the stable reduction must be a tree (i.e., it contains no loops).\n2.  **Combine Constraints:** The arithmetic genus of our curve is 4. For a tree-like dual graph, the genus is simply the sum of the genera of the components. Combined with Raynaud's theorem, this means the stable reduction must be composed of exactly four components of genus 1, and some number (`n_0`) of components of genus 0.\n3.  **Use the Stability Condition:** For a component to be part of a stable curve, it must satisfy the condition `2g - 2 + d > 0`, where `g` is its genus and `d` is its degree in the dual graph (the number of other components it's attached to).\n    *   For a genus 1 component: `2(1) - 2 + d > 0` => `d > 0`. This is always true in a connected graph.\n    *   For a genus 0 component: `2(0) - 2 + d > 0` => `d > 2`. Any genus 0 component must be attached to at least 3 other components.\n4.  **Enumerate Possibilities:** We will systematically count the possible stable tree structures based on the number of genus 0 components (`n_0`). We'll show that `n_0` can only be 0, 1, or 2, and we'll count the valid configurations for each case.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan, explain each step, and calculate the total number of types.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4\n    curve whose Jacobian has good reduction, based on established theorems in\n    algebraic geometry.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the constraints from theory.\")\n    print(\"A theorem by Raynaud implies that any irreducible component of the stable reduction must have genus 0 (a rational curve) or genus 1 (an elliptic curve).\")\n    print(\"Furthermore, the Jacobian having good reduction implies the dual graph of the stable reduction is a tree.
