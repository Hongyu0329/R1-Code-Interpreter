    Analyzes whether Kant's account of aesthetic judgment is descriptive or normative.

    A purely descriptive account explains how things *are*.
    A normative account prescribes how things *ought to be*.

    Kant's 'Critique of Judgment' seeks the conditions for the *possibility* of
    valid aesthetic judgments. He distinguishes a pure "judgment of taste"
    (e.g., "This is beautiful") from a mere judgment of the agreeable
    (e.g., "This is pleasant for me").

    The key is that a judgment of taste carries a "demand for universal assent."
    It claims that everyone *ought* to agree. By setting the rules and conditions
    (like disinterestedness) that a judgment must meet to be considered valid
    and make this universal claim, Kant is setting a standard.

    Setting a standard for correctness or validity is a normative function.
    Therefore, the account is not purely descriptive; it is also normative.
