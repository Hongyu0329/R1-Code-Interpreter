    # The Cheeger constant is given by h = min_{U, |U| <= |V|/2} e(U, V\U) / |U|.
    # The total number of vertices is |V| = 4n.

    # Step 1: Find the minimum value for the numerator, e(U, V\U).
    # A connected 3-regular graph is known to have edge connectivity of at least 2.
    # This means any edge cut must contain at least 2 edges.

    # Step 2: Find the maximum value for the denominator, |U|.
    # To minimize the ratio e/|U|, for a fixed numerator, we must maximize |U|.
    # The definition constrains |U| to be at most half the total vertices.
    # |V| = 4n, so max(|U|) = (4n) / 2 = 2n.
    # We will represent the denominator as a coefficient multiplied by n.

    # Step 3: Calculate the lower bound for the Cheeger constant.
    # h >= min_numerator_e / max(|U|) = 2 / (2*n) = 1/n.
    # This lower bound is achievable by constructing a graph with a cut
    # of size 2 that splits the vertices into two sets of size 2n.
    # Such a graph can be made by taking two 3-regular graphs on 2n vertices
    # and connecting them with 2 edges.

    # Step 4: Output the numbers in the final equation as requested.
    # The final equation for the minimal value is h = 2 / (2*n).
