The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction is a simplifying approximation. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is typically not radial due to the Parker Spiral effect, making an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction for average solar wind speeds. The correct but more complex method is to use a field-aligned coordinate system, often found using Minimum Variance Analysis.
