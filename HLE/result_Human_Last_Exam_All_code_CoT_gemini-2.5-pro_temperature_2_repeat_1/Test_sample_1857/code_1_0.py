  This function provides the solution to the musical riddle.

  across all the works mentioned in the clues.

  The theme is the "Fate" motif from Beethoven's 5th Symphony.
  j = 5: Refers to Beethoven's 5th Symphony and 5th Piano Concerto.
  k = 4: Refers to the 4th movement of the symphony and Britney Spears's 4th album.
  l = -1: Derived from Liszt's piece S.249 (250 + l = 249), and confirmed with the
          other clues involving l.
