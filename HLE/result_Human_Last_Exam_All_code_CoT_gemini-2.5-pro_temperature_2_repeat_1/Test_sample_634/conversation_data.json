    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we will use a standard method based on the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, we need to understand that finding the greatest common **right** divisor (GCRD) of `P1` and `P2` is equivalent to finding the transpose of the greatest common **left** divisor (GCLD) of their transposes, `P1^T` and `P2^T`.\n2.  The GCLD of two polynomial matrices (`A` and `B`) can be found by stacking them into a single compound matrix `M = [A; B]` and then finding its row-reduced echelon form (RREF). The non-zero rows of the RREF of `M` form the GCLD.\n3.  So, the full procedure is:\n    a. Compute the transposes: `P1^T` and `P2^T`.\n    b. Form the compound matrix `M = [P1^T; P2^T]`.\n    c. Compute the row-reduced echelon form of `M`. Let the non-zero part of the result be `G_L`.\n    d. The GCRD of the original `P1` and `P2` is the transpose of `G_L`, i.e., `GCRD = G_L^T`.\n4.  We will use Python's `sympy` library to handle the symbolic polynomial calculations and matrix operations. The final code will print out each element of the resulting GCRD matrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Step 1: Compute the transposes of P1 and P2\n    P1_T = P1.transpose()\n    P2_T = P2.transpose()\n\n    # Step 2: Form the compound matrix M by stacking the transposes vertically\n    M = P1_T.col_join(P2_T)\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the row-reduced echelon form (RREF) of M.\n    # The rref() method returns a tuple: (RREF_matrix, pivot_columns)\n    # We only need the matrix part.\n    rref_M = M.rref()[0]\n\n    # The non-zero rows of the RREF form the GCLD of the transposed matrices.\n    # Since P1 and P2 are 2x2, the GCRD will also be 2x2.\n    # The GCLD will be the top 2 rows of the RREF matrix.\n    # Note: Sympy's rref performs operations over the field of rational functions of 's',\n    # which is the correct procedure for the polynomial Euclidean algorithm.\n    num_cols = P1.shape[1]\n    G_L = rref_M[:num_cols, :]\n\n    # Step 4: The GCRD is the transpose of the GCLD found in the previous step.\n    GCRD = G_L.transpose()\n\n    # Print the resulting GCRD matrix element by element.\n    print(\"The greatest common right divisor is a 2x2 matrix G(s) = [[g11, g12], [g21, g22]] where:\")\n    print(f\"g11 = {GCRD[0, 0]}\")\n    print(f\"g12 = {GCRD[0, 1]}\")\n    print(f\"g21 = {GCRD[1, 0]}\")\n    print(f\"g22 = {GCRD[1, 1]}\")\n\n\nsolve_gcrd()\n```\n<<<\nThe greatest common right divisor is a 2x2 matrix G(s) = [[g11, g12], [g21, g22]] where:\ng11 = 1\ng12 = 0\ng21 = 0\ng22 = 1\n>>>"
