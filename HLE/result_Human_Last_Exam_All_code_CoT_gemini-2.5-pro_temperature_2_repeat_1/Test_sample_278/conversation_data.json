    "My plan is to determine the geometry of the curve and find its bounding box.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Curve in Two Parts:** I'll analyze the parametric equations for the two intervals of the parameter `t`.\n    *   For `t` in `[0, pi]`, the curve is `x = cos(t)`, `y = sin(t)`. This describes the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n    *   For `t` in `(pi, 2pi)`, the curve is `x = cos(t)`, `y = 5 * sin(t)`. This describes the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5.\n\n2.  **Determine the Extent (Bounding Box):** I'll find the minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y` over the entire curve.\n    *   **X-coordinates:** `x` is `cos(t)` for the full range `[0, 2pi)`. The range of `cos(t)` is `[-1, 1]`.\n    *   **Y-coordinates:** For the top part, `y` ranges from `0` to `1`. For the bottom part, `y` ranges from `-5` to `0`. Combining these, the total range for `y` is `[-5, 1]`.\n\n3.  **Find the Enclosing Square:** The smallest square that encloses a shape must have a side length equal to the larger dimension of the shape's bounding box (its width or height).\n    *   Width of the shape = `x_max - x_min`.\n    *   Height of the shape = `y_max - y_min`.\n    *   Side length of the square = `max(Width, Height)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area:** I will calculate the area of this square by squaring its side length. The code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of the smallest square enclosing the given parametric curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Determine the range of y-coordinates.\n    # For t in [0, pi], b=1, so y = sin(t). The range is [0, 1].\n    y_max_part1 = 1.0\n    # For t in (pi, 2*pi), b=5, so y = 5*sin(t). The range is [-5, 0).\n    y_min_part2 = -5.0\n    \n    # The overall y range is the combination of the two parts.\n    y_min = y_min_part2\n    y_max = y_max_part1\n    \n    # 3. Calculate the width and height of the bounding box.\n    width = x_max - x_min\n    height = y_max - y_min\n\n    # 4. The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height.\n    side_length = max(width, height)\n\n    # 5. Calculate the area of the square.\n    area = side_length ** 2\n\n    # Print the breakdown of the calculation.\n    print(f\"The total width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\n    print(f\"The total height of the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\n    print(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square must be the maximum of the width and height, which is {side_length}.\")\n    print(f\"The final area calculation is: {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.\")\n\nsolve_area()\n<<<36.0>>>"
