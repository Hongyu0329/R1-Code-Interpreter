# The graph is K_{1,100}. This means n = 100.
# The global labeling number for K_{1,n} can be found by constructing a set of n labels
# {x_1, ..., x_n} such that no label x_i can be expressed as a sum of any subset
# of the other labels.
# A straightforward way to construct such a set is to use powers of 2.
# For n = 100, we can use the labels {2**0, 2**1, 2**2, ..., 2**(100-1)}.
# The largest label in this set determines the global labeling number k.
# So, k = 2**(100-1) = 2**99.

n = 100
# The equation for the global labeling number k is 2**(n-1)
base = 2
exponent = n - 1

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

# Per the instructions, output the numbers in the final equation.
# The equation is 2**99 = result.
