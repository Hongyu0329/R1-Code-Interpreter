    # Analysis of each statement:
    # I. Supported: Naloxone in Suboxone adds a risk (precipitated withdrawal) if misused,
    #    which can be framed as "less safe" from an adverse event perspective.
    # II. Supported: Subutex (buprenorphine alone) is considered safer and is preferred
    #     for specific populations like pregnant women.
    # III. Supported: When taken as prescribed (sublingually), both have similar safety profiles
    #      as the naloxone in Suboxone has minimal effect.
    # IV. Not Supported: The relative safety and pharmacology are well-understood, not "largely unknown".
    # V. Not Supported: Contains a factual error. Suboxone contains naloxone to deter misuse,
    #    the statement incorrectly says its safety feature is "due to the lack of naloxone".

    # Based on the analysis, statements I, II, and III are the ones supported by evidence.
    correct_statements = ["I", "II", "III"]
    
    # The corresponding answer choice is B.

    print("The following statements are supported by evidence:")
    print("I. Suboxone could be seen as less safe than Subutex because it contains naloxone, which is included to deter misuse by injection. Naloxone can precipitate withdrawal symptoms if the medication is injected, reducing the potential for abuse.")
    print("II. Subutex could be seen as safer than Suboxone because it does not contain naloxone, which can cause withdrawal symptoms in some patients if they are sensitive to it or if the medication is misused. In certain clinical situations, such as in pregnant women or individuals with a known sensitivity to naloxone, Subutex may be preferred to avoid these potential issues.")
    print("III. Suboxone could be seen as similarly safe to Subutex because both medications contain buprenorphine, which is the primary active ingredient responsible for their therapeutic effects. The safety profile in terms of therapeutic use is similar when taken as prescribed.")
