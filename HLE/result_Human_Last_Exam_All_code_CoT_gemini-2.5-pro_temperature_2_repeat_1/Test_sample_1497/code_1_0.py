    # --- Step 1: Analyze the physical situation for each variation ---

    # Variation (1): 'sul ponticello' (playing near the bridge)
    # This technique excites higher harmonics of the string, changing the source timbre.
    # The parameter 'nu' controls the damping of string harmonics.
    # Emphasizing higher harmonics means less damping, so 'nu' is the primary change.
    variation_1_group = "ii"

    # Variation (2): with a bridge mute
    # A mute adds mass and damping to the bridge, affecting the violin body's resonances (the filter).
    # It tends to darken the sound by damping higher frequencies more.
    # This primarily affects parameters of higher resonances: 'mu', 'a_2', 'f_2'.
    variation_2_group = "iv"

    # For variation (2), the last listed member of the group is f_2.
    # Adding mass to a vibrating system lowers its resonant frequencies.
    # Therefore, f_2 goes down.
    direction_for_2 = "down"

    # Variation (3): in a room filled with helium
    # The speed of sound in helium is much higher than in air.
    # The violin body's air cavity resonances have frequencies proportional to the speed of sound.
    # This will shift all body resonances ('f_m') upwards. We map this fundamental change
    # to the group containing the main body resonance, 'f_1'.
    variation_3_group = "iii"

    # Variation (4): on the E string, instead of the A string
    # The parameter 'F' represents the fundamental frequency of the open string.
    # Changing from the A string to the E string is a direct change of 'F'.
    variation_4_group = "i"

    # --- Step 2: Assemble and print the final answer in the required format ---
    # The format is a comma-separated string of the four group identifiers
    # followed by the direction of change for the parameter in variation (2).
