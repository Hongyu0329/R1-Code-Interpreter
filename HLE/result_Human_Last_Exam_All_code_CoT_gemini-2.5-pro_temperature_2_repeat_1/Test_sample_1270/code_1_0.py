# The fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene" combines the concepts of
# a Mercedes logo and a benzene molecule.

# A standard benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms.
carbons_in_benzene_ring = 6

# The Mercedes logo is a three-pointed star.
# The most direct chemical interpretation is to add three single-carbon
# groups (methyl groups) to the benzene ring in a symmetrical pattern
# (at positions 1, 3, and 5).
# This adds 3 more carbon atoms to the structure.
carbons_in_mercedes_spokes = 3

# Calculate the total number of carbon atoms.
total_carbons = carbons_in_benzene_ring + carbons_in_mercedes_spokes

# Print the explanation and the final equation.
print(f"The 'benzene' part of the name implies a base ring of {carbons_in_benzene_ring} carbon atoms.")
print(f"The 'mercedes' part implies a three-pointed star, which chemically corresponds to adding {carbons_in_mercedes_spokes} more carbon atoms as symmetrical groups.")
print(f"Therefore, the total number of carbons is {carbons_in_benzene_ring} + {carbons_in_mercedes_spokes} = {total_carbons}.")
