    "The primary threat from quantum computers to symmetric-key cryptography is Grover's algorithm. Grover's algorithm can search a key space of size N in roughly sqrt(N) operations.\n\nFor a symmetric key of length 'k' bits, the key space has 2^k possible keys.\n- A classical computer would need, on average, 2^(k-1) operations for a brute-force attack. This is considered a k-bit security level.\n- A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm would need about sqrt(2^k) = 2^(k/2) operations. This effectively halves the security level in bits.\n\nTo maintain a desired security level, say 'S' bits, against a quantum computer, we need a key of length 'k' such that k/2 ≥ S.\nTherefore, k ≥ 2 * S.\n\nThe current industry standard for strong security is 128 bits. To maintain this 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the symmetric key length must be at least 2 * 128 = 256 bits.\n\nThe code below demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_post_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure\n    against a quantum computer, based on a desired classical security level.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The current standard for a strong security level is 128 bits.\n    # This means a classical computer would need about 2^128 operations to break it.\n    classical_security_level = 128\n    \n    # Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm, can find a key in a time\n    # proportional to the square root of the number of keys.\n    # For a k-bit key, there are 2^k possible keys.\n    # The quantum attack complexity is sqrt(2^k) = 2^(k/2).\n    # To maintain the desired security level 'S', we need k/2 >= S.\n    # Therefore, k >= 2 * S.\n    \n    post_quantum_key_length = 2 * classical_security_level\n    \n    print(f\"To achieve a classical security level of {classical_security_level} bits, a key of {classical_security_level} bits is needed.\")\n    print(\"A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm can search a key space of size 2^k in sqrt(2^k) = 2^(k/2) steps.\")\n    print(\"This effectively halves the bit security of the key.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, to maintain a {classical_security_level}-bit security level against a quantum computer, the key length must be at least:\")\n    print(f\"2 * {classical_security_level} = {post_quantum_key_length} bits.\")\n\ncalculate_post_quantum_key_length()\n<<<A>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long does a symmetric key need to be at least, such that an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer cannot crack it?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 256\nB. 128\nC. 512\nD. 1024\nE. 2048\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
