    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the number of non-negative integer solutions for the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. The order of the integers matters, so, for example, $(x_1, x_2, ...) = (44, 8, 4, 2, 2)$ is a different solution from $(2, 2, 4, 8, 44)$.\n\n2.  **Devise a Strategy:** A brute-force search trying all combinations for $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$ would be too slow. A more efficient approach is to find the unique sets of integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ that satisfy the equation and then calculate the number of unique permutations for each set.\n\n3.  **Search for Unique Sets:** To find each unique set of numbers just once, I'll search for solutions with an imposed order: $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$. This can be done with a series of nested loops. The search space will be pruned at each level by ensuring the sum of squares does not exceed the target (2024) and that the ordering is maintained. The maximum possible value for any $x_i$ is $\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Permutations:** For each ordered set of solutions `(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)` found, we need to count how many distinct arrangements (permutations) are possible. If a set has repeated numbers, the formula for permutations with repetitions will be used:\n    \\[ \\frac{5!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot ... \\cdot n_k!} \\]\n    where $n_i$ is the count of each distinct number in the set. For instance, the set $\\{44, 8, 4, 2, 2\\}$ has one number repeated twice, so it generates $5!/2! = 60$ unique solutions. A set with all distinct numbers like $\\{42, 15, 5, 3, 1\\}$ generates $5! = 120$ solutions.\n\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The code will find all the unique ordered sets, print them, calculate the number of permutations for each, and sum these values to obtain the final total number of solutions.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_sum_of_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine\n    equation x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    max_val = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    \n    solutions = []\n\n    # Use nested loops to find unique ordered combinations (x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= x4 >= x5)\n    for x1 in range(max_val, -1, -1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        if s1 > target:\n            continue\n        \n        rem1 = target - s1\n        max_x2 = int(math.sqrt(rem1))\n        for x2 in range(min(x1, max_x2), -1, -1):\n            s2 = x2 * x2\n            rem2 = rem1 - s2\n            if rem2 < 0:\n                continue\n\n            max_x3 = int(math.sqrt(rem2))\n            for x3 in range(min(x2, max_x3), -1, -1):\n                s3 = x3 * x3\n                rem3 = rem2 - s3\n                if rem3 < 0:\n                    continue\n                \n                max_x4 = int(math.sqrt(rem3))\n                for x4 in range(min(x3, max_x4), -1, -1):\n                    s4 = x4 * x4\n                    rem4 = rem3 - s4\n                    if rem4 < 0:\n                        continue\n                        \n                    x5 = int(math.sqrt(rem4))\n                    \n                    if x5 * x5 == rem4:\n                        if x5 <= x4:\n                            solutions.append((x1, x2, x3, x4, x5))\n    \n    total_solutions = 0\n    unique_solutions = sorted(list(set(solutions)), reverse=True)\n    \n    print(\"Finding non-negative integer solutions for the equation:\")\n    print(\"x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² + x₅² = 2024\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"Found {len(unique_solutions)} unique sets of numbers (partitions).\\n\")\n\n    for sol_tuple in unique_solutions:\n        # Calculate permutations for the current solution set\n        counts = Counter(sol_tuple)\n        numerator = math.factorial(5)\n        denominator = 1\n        for count in counts.values():\n            denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n        \n        num_perms = numerator // denominator\n        total_solutions += num_perms\n        \n        # Format the output for each partition found\n        equation_parts = [f\"{x}²\" for x in sol_tuple]\n        sum_parts = [f\"{x*x}\" for x in sol_tuple]\n        \n        print(f\"Set: {sol_tuple}\")\n        print(f\"  └─ Equation: {' + '.join(equation_parts)} = {' + '.join(sum_parts)} = 2024\")\n        print(f\"  └─ Number of unique solutions from this set: {num_perms}\")\n        print()\n\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"Total number of non-negative integer solutions is: {total_solutions}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_sum_of_squares()\n```\n<<<5120>>>"
