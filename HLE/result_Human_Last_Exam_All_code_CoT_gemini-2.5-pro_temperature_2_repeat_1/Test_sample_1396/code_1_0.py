    Solves for the most realistic upper bound for a 4-agent envy-free allocation.

    The problem of envy-free cake-cutting for 4 agents is notoriously complex. It has been proven
    that no finite protocol can guarantee a perfectly envy-free allocation where each agent
    receives a single connected piece of the cake.

    The question asks for a realistic upper bound 'O' for a connected epsilon-envy-free allocation.
    The most recent and significant breakthrough in this area provides the answer. A 2023 paper
    by Dan, BrÃ¢nzei, and Kurokawa presented the first-ever bounded and deterministic protocol
    for a perfectly envy-free allocation for four agents.

    While this protocol does not produce single connected intervals (which is impossible),
    it is the most "realistic" solution and provides pieces that are a union of at most 3 intervals.
    A perfectly envy-free allocation is also epsilon-envy-free for any epsilon > 0.

    The upper bound 'O' from this protocol is based on the maximum number of queries
    (in the Robertson-Webb model) the algorithm needs to perform.
