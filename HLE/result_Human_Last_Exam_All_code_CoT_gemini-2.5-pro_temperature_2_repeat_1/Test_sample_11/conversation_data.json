    "This is a knowledge-based question. My plan is to first identify the correct Israeli statute based on legal history and then write a simple Python script to print the name of that statute, as per the user's instructions. The specific statute that is widely recognized for introducing the principle of \"good faith\" into Israeli law is the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973. The script will print its name, omitting \"the\" and the year as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the statute that first introduced\n# the concept of \"good faith\" into the laws of the modern State of Israel.\n# The user has requested that the answer not include \"the\" or the statute's year.\n\nstatute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\"?
