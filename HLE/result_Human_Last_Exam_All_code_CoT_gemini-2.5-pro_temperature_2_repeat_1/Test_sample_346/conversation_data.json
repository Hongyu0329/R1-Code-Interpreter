    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will parse the complex SKI combinator expression. I'll break it down into more manageable, named sub-expressions.\n2.  I will analyze the function of each sub-expression and operator within the context of Church numerals. Key operators I've identified are `succ` (the successor function `n -> n+1`), function application between Church numerals (which corresponds to exponentiation), and `S(I)` which acts as a special operator.\n3.  I will demonstrate that `S(I)` acts as the successor function (`succ`) when its argument is a Church numeral.\n4.  The expression contains a recurring sub-expression, `C = succ(S(I)(I))`. I will analyze how this function `C` operates on a Church numeral `n`, and I will deduce that it transforms `n` into a new Church numeral `(n^n) * n`.\n5.  With this formula, I will evaluate the nested application `C(C(2))`, where `2` is the Church numeral for two. This will give me the value of a large intermediate expression, which I'll call `Y`.\n6.  The full expression is equivalent to `S(I)(Y)`. Since `Y` is a Church numeral, this simplifies to `Y + 1`. This gives me the final value of the Church integer `n`.\n7.  Finally, I'll calculate `log_2(n)` as requested, outputting the components of the final calculation as part of the code's output.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The user wants to find log_2(n) for a Church integer n given by the SKI expression:\n# n = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\n#\n# Step 1: Deconstruct the expression.\n# The expression can be seen as E = Op(Y), where Op = S(I) is an operator\n# and Y is the argument S(I)(B)(C).\n# This Y can be further decomposed. The structure is essentially:\n# B = S(I)(K(two))\n# C = succ(S(I)(I))\n# Y = S(I)(B)(C)\n# n = S(I)(Y)\n# where `two` is the church numeral 2.\n#\n# Step 2: Analyze the operators.\n# - The combinator for `S(I)(A)(B)` reduces to `B(A(B))`.\n# - The function `C = succ(S(I)(I))` when applied to a Church numeral `m`, evaluates to the Church numeral `(m^m) * m`.\n# - The operator `S(I)` when applied to a Church numeral `m` evaluates to `m + 1`.\n#\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of Y.\n# Y = C(B(C)).\n# The inner term is B(C) = (S(I)(K(two)))(C). The combinator `S(I)(K(two))` acts as a function `Î»x.x(2)`.\n# So, B(C) becomes C(2).\n# Thus, Y = C(C(2)).\n\n# Step 3a: Calculate C(2)\n# Using the formula for C(m) with m=2: (2^2) * 2\nc_of_2_base = 2\nc_of_2_exp = 2\nc_of_2_mult = 2\nc_of_2_result = (c_of_2_base**c_of_2_exp) * c_of_2_mult\nprint(f\"The intermediate value C(2) is ({c_of_2_base}^{c_of_2_exp}) * {c_of_2_mult} = {c_of_2_result}\")\n\n# Step 3b: Calculate Y = C(C(2)) = C(8)\n# Using the formula for C(m) with m=8: (8^8) * 8\ny_base = c_of_2_result\ny_exp = y_base\ny_mult = y_base\n# This is 8^9\ny_result_base = y_base\ny_result_exp = y_exp + 1\nprint(f\"The main argument Y is C({y_base}) = ({y_base}^{y_exp}) * {y_mult} = {y_result_base}^{y_result_exp}\")\n\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final integer n.\n# n = S(I)(Y). Since Y is a Church numeral, this is `Y + 1`.\n# So n = 8^9 + 1\nn_add = 1\nn_base = y_result_base\nn_exp = y_result_exp\nn_val = n_base**n_exp + n_add\nprint(f\"The church integer n is {n_base}^{n_exp} + {n_add} = {n_val}\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate log_2(n).\n# The final equation is log_2(n_add + n_base^n_exp)\nlog_result = math.log2(n_val)\nprint(f\"\\nThe final equation is log_2({n_add} + {n_base}^{n_exp})\")\nprint(f\"log_2({n_val}) = {log_result}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe value is extremely close to 27.\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = 27.0\n# The question implicitly asks for the integer part, as the fractional part is negligible.\nfinal_answer_formatted = f\"<<<{int(final_answer)}>>>\"\nprint(final_answer_formatted)\n```"
