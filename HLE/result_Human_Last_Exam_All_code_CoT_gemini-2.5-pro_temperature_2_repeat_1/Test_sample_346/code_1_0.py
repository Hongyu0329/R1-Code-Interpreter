# The user wants to find log_2(n) for a Church integer n given by the SKI expression:
# n = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))
#
# Step 1: Deconstruct the expression.
# The expression can be seen as E = Op(Y), where Op = S(I) is an operator
# and Y is the argument S(I)(B)(C).
# This Y can be further decomposed. The structure is essentially:
# B = S(I)(K(two))
# C = succ(S(I)(I))
# Y = S(I)(B)(C)
# n = S(I)(Y)
# where `two` is the church numeral 2.
#
# Step 2: Analyze the operators.
# - The combinator for `S(I)(A)(B)` reduces to `B(A(B))`.
# - The function `C = succ(S(I)(I))` when applied to a Church numeral `m`, evaluates to the Church numeral `(m^m) * m`.
# - The operator `S(I)` when applied to a Church numeral `m` evaluates to `m + 1`.
#
# Step 3: Calculate the value of Y.
# Y = C(B(C)).
# The inner term is B(C) = (S(I)(K(two)))(C). The combinator `S(I)(K(two))` acts as a function `Î»x.x(2)`.
# So, B(C) becomes C(2).
# Thus, Y = C(C(2)).

# Step 3a: Calculate C(2)
# Using the formula for C(m) with m=2: (2^2) * 2
c_of_2_base = 2
c_of_2_exp = 2
c_of_2_mult = 2
c_of_2_result = (c_of_2_base**c_of_2_exp) * c_of_2_mult
print(f"The intermediate value C(2) is ({c_of_2_base}^{c_of_2_exp}) * {c_of_2_mult} = {c_of_2_result}")

# Step 3b: Calculate Y = C(C(2)) = C(8)
# Using the formula for C(m) with m=8: (8^8) * 8
y_base = c_of_2_result
y_exp = y_base
y_mult = y_base
# This is 8^9
y_result_base = y_base
y_result_exp = y_exp + 1
print(f"The main argument Y is C({y_base}) = ({y_base}^{y_exp}) * {y_mult} = {y_result_base}^{y_result_exp}")


# Step 4: Calculate the final integer n.
# n = S(I)(Y). Since Y is a Church numeral, this is `Y + 1`.
# So n = 8^9 + 1
n_add = 1
n_base = y_result_base
n_exp = y_result_exp
n_val = n_base**n_exp + n_add
print(f"The church integer n is {n_base}^{n_exp} + {n_add} = {n_val}")

# Step 5: Calculate log_2(n).
# The final equation is log_2(n_add + n_base^n_exp)
log_result = math.log2(n_val)
print(f"\nThe final equation is log_2({n_add} + {n_base}^{n_exp})")
print(f"log_2({n_val}) = {log_result}")
print("\nThe value is extremely close to 27.")

# Final answer in the required format
final_answer = 27.0
# The question implicitly asks for the integer part, as the fractional part is negligible.
