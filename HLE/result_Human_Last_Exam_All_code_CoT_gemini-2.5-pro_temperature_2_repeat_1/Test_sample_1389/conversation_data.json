    "An all-or-nothing vaccine (also known as a perfect vaccine) confers complete immunity to a fraction of vaccinated individuals (`VE_s`) and no protection to the rest (`1 - VE_s`). We want to determine if the standard vaccine efficacy formula, `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)`, correctly represents this underlying efficacy.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define a hypothetical scenario:** We'll set a value for the true vaccine efficacy (`VE_s`), which is the proportion of people the vaccine fully protects. We'll also define a baseline force of infection (`lambda`), which represents the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected.\n2.  **Calculate Incidence Rates:**\n    *   **Unvaccinated Group (`IR_u`):** All individuals in this group are susceptible, so their incidence rate is equal to the force of infection, `lambda`.\n    *   **Vaccinated Group (`IR_v`):** Only the fraction of individuals not protected by the vaccine (`1 - VE_s`) are susceptible. The incidence rate for this group is the baseline infection rate `lambda` multiplied by the proportion that is still susceptible. Thus, `IR_v = lambda * (1 - VE_s)`.\n3.  **Calculate Estimated VE:** Using these two incidence rates, we will calculate the `IRR` (`IR_v / IR_u`) and then the estimated vaccine efficacy using the formula `VE_est = 1 - IRR`.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will compare the calculated `VE_est` with the initial true efficacy `VE_s`. If they are equal, the formula provides a correct estimate.\n\nThe Python code below will simulate this process. It will show that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the calculated efficacy from the incidence rates perfectly matches the true underlying efficacy.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes if 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) correctly estimates\n    the efficacy of an 'all-or-nothing' vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define a hypothetical scenario\n    # VE_s: True vaccine efficacy (proportion of vaccinated who are fully protected)\n    # This is the \"per-exposure\" efficacy averaged over the entire vaccinated population.\n    VE_s = 0.90  # 90% efficacy\n\n    # lambda: Force of infection (rate of new infections in a fully susceptible population)\n    lambda_rate = 0.05  # 5 cases per 100 person-years\n\n    print(\"--- Scenario ---\")\n    print(f\"True Vaccine Efficacy (proportion protected, VE_s): {VE_s:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Force of Infection (lambda): {lambda_rate:.2f}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate Incidence Rates\n    # Incidence rate in the unvaccinated (everyone is susceptible)\n    IR_u = lambda_rate\n    \n    # Incidence rate in the vaccinated\n    # Only the proportion (1 - VE_s) is susceptible\n    IR_v = lambda_rate * (1 - VE_s)\n    \n    print(\"--- Calculations ---\")\n    print(f\"Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated (IR_u): {IR_u:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Incidence Rate in Vaccinated (IR_v): {IR_v:.4f}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate Estimated VE\n    # Incidence Rate Ratio\n    IRR = IR_v / IR_u\n    \n    # Estimated VE from IRR\n    VE_estimated = 1 - IRR\n    \n    print(\"--- Final Equation ---\")\n    # We are calculating: 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)\n    print(f\"Estimated VE = 1 - ({IR_v:.4f} / {IR_u:.4f})\")\n    print(f\"Estimated VE = 1 - {IRR:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Estimated VE = {VE_estimated:.2f}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Compare and Conclude\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The true efficacy was {VE_s:.2f}, and the estimated efficacy is {VE_estimated:.2f}.\")\n    \n    if VE_s == VE_estimated:\n        print(\"Therefore, 1 - IRR correctly estimates the vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\")\n    elif VE_s > VE_estimated:\n        print(\"Therefore, 1 - IRR underestimates the vaccine efficacy.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Therefore, 1 - IRR overestimates the vaccine efficacy.\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nanalyze_vaccine_efficacy()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
