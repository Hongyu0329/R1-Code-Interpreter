    "The user's question contains a contradiction. Optical activity is a property that arises from chirality. A crystal class can only be optically active if it is chiral. An achiral crystal class, by definition, is not chiral and therefore cannot be optically active.\n\nI will provide a Python script that explains this fundamental principle. The script will define the sets of crystal classes based on their properties (chiral/achiral, polar/non-polar, optically active) and then attempt to find the intersection as requested by the user. The result will be an empty set, demonstrating the contradiction. The script will also provide the lists for related, valid combinations of these properties to be more helpful.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_optical_activity_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the symmetry requirements for optical activity in crystal classes\n    and addresses the user's specific query.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Property Definitions based on the 32 Crystallographic Point Groups ---\n\n    # Optical activity is an intrinsic property of chiral materials.\n    # Therefore, the set of optically active groups is identical to the set of chiral groups.\n    # These groups lack an inversion center, mirror plane, or any roto-inversion axis.\n    optically_active_chiral_groups = {\n        '1', '2', '3', '4', '6',\n        '222', '32', '422', '622',\n        '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # All 32 point groups.\n    all_32_point_groups = {\n        '1', '2', 'm', '-1', '2/m', 'mm2', '222', 'mmm',\n        '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m',\n        '4', '-4', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm',\n        '6', '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm',\n        '23', 'm-3', '432', '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Achiral groups are all groups that are not chiral.\n    achiral_groups = all_32_point_groups - optically_active_chiral_groups\n\n    # Polar groups possess a unique polar direction.\n    polar_groups = {'1', '2', 'm', 'mm2', '3', '3m', '4', '4mm', '6', '6mm'}\n    \n    # Non-polar groups are all groups that are not polar.\n    non_polar_groups = all_32_point_groups - polar_groups\n\n    # --- Analysis of the User's Query ---\n    \n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Query: 'achiral', 'non-polar', and 'optically active' ---\")\n    \n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    A fundamental principle in crystallography and optics is that true optical\n    activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light) can only occur in a\n    chiral medium.

An achiral crystal, by definition,\n    possesses at least one of these symmetry elements that forbid optical\n    activity.
