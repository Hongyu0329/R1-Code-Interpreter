    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the characters from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* based on the provided answer choices. The core of the question revolves around the theme of nostalgia and disconnection from Earth, which is central to the film's protagonist. I will set up a data structure in Python to hold information about each character's psychological state and connection to Earth. The code will then identify the character who most strongly expresses shame and loss related to earthly sensations like the rustling of leaves. Finally, the script will print the reasoning and the name of the correct character.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the characters of the 1972 film \"Solaris\" to answer a specific trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    characters = {\n        'Kris': {\n            'role': \"The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the space station.\",\n            'connection_to_earth': \"Deeply melancholic and nostalgic for Earth.
