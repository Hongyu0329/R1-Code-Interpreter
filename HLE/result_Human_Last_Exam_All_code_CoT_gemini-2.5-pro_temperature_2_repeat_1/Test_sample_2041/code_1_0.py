    Solves the lambda calculus problem by determining the number of "shallow" functions.

    The problem asks for the number of extensionally distinct functions of type
    PPPX -> PX induced by "shallow" expressions e(p, x) of type Bool.

    Step 1: Analyze the shallow condition.
    A shallow expression 'e' means that the variable p: PPPX is only applied to
    arguments that do not depend on p itself. These arguments must be built from x: X.
    The type of p is ((X -> Bool) -> Bool) -> Bool.
    The argument to p, let's call it A, must have type (X -> Bool) -> Bool.

    Step 2: Determine the possible arguments A for p.
    A is a function that takes a predicate q: X -> Bool and returns a Bool.
    Since A is constructed from x, its behavior can only depend on the result of q(x).
    Let v = q(x). Then A is a function of the form f(v), where f: Bool -> Bool.
    There are exactly 4 such functions 'f':
    1. Identity: f(v) = v
    2. Negation: f(v) = NOT v
    3. Constant True: f(v) = True
    4. Constant False: f(v) = False
    
    This means there are 4 distinct 'shallow' arguments (probes) we can pass to p.
    """
    
    num_probes = 4
    print(f"Number of distinct shallow arguments (probes) for p: {num_probes}")
    
    """
    Step 3: Count the boolean functions.
    Applying p to these 4 distinct probes gives us 4 fundamental boolean values:
    b1, b2, b3, b4.
    The expression 'e' can be any boolean function of these 4 values.
    We need to count the number of boolean functions of 4 variables.
    The formula for the number of boolean functions of n variables is 2^(2^n).
