    print("A Diophantine equation is defined by a polynomial with a finite number of terms, variables, and integer coefficients.")
    print("Any such polynomial can be encoded using a finite amount of data. The set of all possible finite data encodings is countably infinite.")
    print("Therefore, the set of all Diophantine equations is countably infinite (its cardinality is Aleph_0).")
    print("Since S is a subset of all Diophantine equations, its cardinality must be at most Aleph_0.\n")

    print("Step 2: Connect Provability in ZFC to Diophantine Equations")
    print("===========================================================")
    print("The MRDP (Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam) theorem states that any recursively enumerable set can be represented as the set of solutions to a Diophantine equation.")
    print("A profound consequence, combined with Gödel's work, is that statements about the consistency of axiomatic systems can be encoded as statements about Diophantine equations.")
    print("Specifically, the statement 'ZFC is consistent', denoted Con(ZFC), is equivalent to the statement 'a certain Diophantine equation D_ZFC has no solutions in the natural numbers'.")
    print("Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem states that ZFC cannot prove its own consistency (assuming it is consistent).")

    print("==================================================")
    print("The problem requires that a stronger theory, ZFC + psi, can prove these equations are unsolvable.")
    print("To prove the entire infinite family of statements {C_n}, we need psi to be a very strong statement.")
    print("A suitable choice for psi is a large cardinal axiom, e.g., psi = 'There exists a weakly compact cardinal'.")

    print("The one for Con(ZFC) would be incomprehensibly larger. For example, if we were to construct a hypothetical equation P(x_0, ..., x_k) = 0 for Con(ZFC), we cannot actually print its coefficients [c_0, c_1, ...].")
    print("P would have integer solutions if and only if ZFC were inconsistent.")
