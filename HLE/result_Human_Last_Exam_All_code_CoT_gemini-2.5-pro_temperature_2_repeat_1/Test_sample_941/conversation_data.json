    "To answer this question, I will create a small database of information about the ballet schools listed. This database, represented as a Python dictionary, will include key details about each school's training methodology, specifically focusing on their approach to pointe work.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a dictionary where each key is an answer choice (A, B, C, D, E) and the value is another dictionary containing the school's name and a description of its training style.\n2.  Write a script that searches through this database for the school specifically known for emphasizing pointe work from the beginning of class, including the barre. This is a distinguishing feature of the Balanchine method.\n3.  The script will identify and print the name of the school that matches this criterion, explaining why it's the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_ballet_school():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a dataset of ballet schools to find which one is known for\n    female dancers training on pointe at the barre.\n    \"\"\"\n    schools_database = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'La Scala Theatre Ballet School',\n            'training_notes': 'Primarily uses the Cecchetti method.
