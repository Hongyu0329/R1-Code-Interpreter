    "The task is to identify a polycyclic hydrocarbon that is named after a creature extinct for over 65 million years. This points to dinosaurs or their contemporaries from the Mesozoic Era. A search for hydrocarbons named after such creatures leads to \"Pterodactyladiene\". This strained hydrocarbon (chemical formula C₂₆H₁₄) was synthesized and named because its 3D structure was humorously compared to a Pterodactyl, a flying reptile that went extinct around 66 million years ago.\n\nI will write a Python script to present this information. The script will define variables for the hydrocarbon's name, the creature it's named after, and the extinction period, and then print a sentence that answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_hydrocarbon_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature extinct for over 65 million years.\n    \"\"\"\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"Pterodactyladiene\"\n    creature_name = \"Pterodactyl\"\n    extinction_period_mya = 66\n\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over {extinction_period_mya} million years is called: {hydrocarbon_name}\")\n    print(f\"It is named after the {creature_name}.\")\n\nfind_hydrocarbon_name()\n```\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
