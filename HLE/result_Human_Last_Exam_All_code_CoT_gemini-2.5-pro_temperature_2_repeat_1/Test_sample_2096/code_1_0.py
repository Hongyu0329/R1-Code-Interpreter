# This script solves the riddle by breaking down the clues.

# Step 1: Identify the key clues in the riddle.
# The riddle contains two critical pieces of information for solving the puzzle:
# - Being "X" was considered "shameful for the Pope."
# - The word "X" was "written in the 1960s."
# The story about Paul II and Constantinople is likely a misdirection.
print("Step 1: The key clues are 'shameful for the Pope' and that 'X' is a word from the 1960s.")

# Step 2: Analyze the phrase "shameful for the Pope."
# The Pope, as the successor to Saint Peter, is symbolically the "rock" (from Greek "Petros")
# upon which the Church is built. This represents stability and a firm foundation.
print("Step 2: A Pope should be a 'rock' for the church, representing stability.")

# Step 3: Determine the opposite of a stable "rock."
# The opposite of a stable foundation stone is a "rolling stone," which gathers no moss.
# This represents instability, unreliability, and rootlessnessâ€”all shameful qualities for a Pope.
print("Step 3: The opposite of a stable rock is a 'rolling stone', which implies instability.")

# Step 4: Connect "rolling stone" to the 1960s.
# The term "Rolling Stone" became extremely famous in the 1960s through multiple cultural phenomena:
# - The rock band "The Rolling Stones" (formed 1962).
# - Bob Dylan's classic song "Like a Rolling Stone" (1965).
# - "Rolling Stone" magazine (founded 1967).
# This perfectly matches the clue that "X" was "written in the 1960s".
print("Step 4: The term 'Rolling Stone' was popularized in the 1960s by the band, a famous song, and a magazine.")

# Step 5: Conclude the final answer as a single word.
# The riddle asks for a single word. The magazine "Rolling Stone" is often stylized as one word.
final_answer = "Rollingstone"
print("\nConclusion: The word X is a pun combining papal symbolism and 1960s pop culture.")
print("The final answer is:")
