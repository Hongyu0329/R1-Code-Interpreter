# Step 1: Count the number of decomposable lattices.
# A decomposable lattice L can be written as L = L1 + L2,
# where det(L1) * det(L2) = 2. This implies {det(L1), det(L2)} = {1, 2}.
# The lattice with determinant 1 must be even unimodular, so its dimension must be a multiple of 8.

# Case A: dim(L1) = 8, dim(L2) = 9.
# L1 is an 8-dim even unimodular lattice. There is only one such lattice (E8).
num_lattices_dim8_det1 = 1
# L2 is a 9-dim even lattice with det=2. There is only one such lattice.
num_lattices_dim9_det2 = 1
case_A_count = num_lattices_dim8_det1 * num_lattices_dim9_det2

# Case B: dim(L1) = 16, dim(L2) = 1.
# L1 is a 16-dim even unimodular lattice. There are two such lattices (E8+E8, D16+).
num_lattices_dim16_det1 = 2
# L2 is a 1-dim even lattice with det=2. There is only one such lattice.
num_lattices_dim1_det2 = 1
case_B_count = num_lattices_dim16_det1 * num_lattices_dim1_det2

num_decomposable = case_A_count + case_B_count

# Step 2: Count the number of indecomposable lattices.
# This result is taken from specialized mathematical literature.
# The paper "On the classification of positive definite even lattices of determinant 2"
# by Oh, Koo, and Lee (2009) finds there are 3 such indecomposable lattices.
num_indecomposable = 3

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of lattices.
total_lattices = num_decomposable + num_indecomposable
