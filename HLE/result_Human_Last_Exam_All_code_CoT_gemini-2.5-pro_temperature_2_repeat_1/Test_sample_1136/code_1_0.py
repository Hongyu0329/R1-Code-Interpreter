    explanation = """
In a blockchain system, liveness and safety are two fundamental properties:

1.  **Liveness**: This property guarantees that the system will eventually make progress. In a blockchain, it means that any valid transaction submitted to the network will eventually be included in a block and confirmed. Liveness ensures that "something good eventually happens."

2.  **Safety**: This property guarantees that the system never produces an incorrect result or enters an invalid state. In a blockchain, it means that once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or altered (immutability), and forks are resolved consistently, preventing issues like double-spending. Safety ensures that "nothing bad ever happens."

**Scenario Analysis:**

The statement "no transaction has been included for 1 day" directly describes a failure of progress. The system has stalled.

*   **Is liveness broken?** Yes, for sure. Because valid transactions are not being included, the system is not making progress, which is a clear violation of the liveness property.

*   **Is safety broken?** Not necessarily. The fact that the chain is not growing does not mean that the existing, confirmed part of the chain is incorrect or has been compromised. The already recorded history can still be perfectly valid and immutable. The system has halted, but it hasn't produced an invalid state. Therefore, safety may not be broken.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, it is certain that liveness is broken, but it is not certain that safety is broken. This corresponds directly to option B.
