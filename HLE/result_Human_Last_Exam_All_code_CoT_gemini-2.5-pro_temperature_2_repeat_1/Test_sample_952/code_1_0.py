# The problem asks for the largest k such that any arrangement of k diamonds is not "frozen".
# This is equivalent to finding k = m - 1, where m is the minimum number of diamonds
# in a frozen arrangement.

# From mathematical analysis, we can prove that an arrangement of 1, 2, or 3 diamonds
# cannot be fully frozen on a large grid. At least one diamond will always have a valid move.
# This means the minimum size of a frozen arrangement, m, must be greater than 3.
# m > 3

# We can construct a frozen arrangement with 4 diamonds.
# By placing the 4 diamonds in a specific pattern, we can ensure no diamond can move.
# An example of such a frozen arrangement on the 2024x2024 grid is placing diamonds
# at the corners of a 3x3 square, located in a corner of the larger grid.
# For example, at cells (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2).
# A diamond at (0,0) has neighbors (0,1) and (1,0).
# A move to (0,1) is blocked by the diamond at (0,2).
# A move to (1,0) is blocked by the diamond at (2,0).
# So the diamond at (0,0) is frozen. By symmetry, all 4 diamonds are frozen.
# This proves that the minimum size of a frozen arrangement, m, is at most 4.
# m <= 4

# Combining m > 3 and m <= 4, we find that the minimum size of a frozen arrangement is:
m_frozen = 4

# The largest value k for which ANY arrangement is NOT frozen is m_frozen - 1.
k = m_frozen - 1
