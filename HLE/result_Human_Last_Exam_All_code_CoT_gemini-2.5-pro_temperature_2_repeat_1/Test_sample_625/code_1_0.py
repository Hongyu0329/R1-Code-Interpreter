# The task is to identify the number of essential information types for
# a 13C metabolic flux analysis at steady state from a given list of six.

# We will represent the list of six information types with a boolean list.
# True means the information is required, False means it is not.
# 1. Metabolic reaction stoichiometry: Required (True)
# 2. Maximum cell density: Not required (False)
# 3. Biomass composition: Required (True)
# 4. Enzyme kinetics: Not required (False)
# 5. Regulatory networks: Not required (False)
# 6. Isotope labeling patterns: Required (True)
is_required_list = [True, False, True, False, False, True]

# We can find the total number of required items by summing the boolean list,
# where True is treated as 1 and False is treated as 0.
number_of_required_items = sum(is_required_list)

# Print the final result.
print(f"Out of the 6 listed information types, the number required for a 13C metabolic flux analysis is:")
