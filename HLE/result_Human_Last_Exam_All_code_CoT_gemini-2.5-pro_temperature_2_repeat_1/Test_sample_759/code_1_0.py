def check_automorphism():
    """
    This function checks if a specific permutation is an automorphism of a specific graph.
    The graph is the commonly cited candidate for the smallest graph with |Aut(G)|=3.
    It has n=9 vertices and e=9 edges.

    Vertices are numbered 0 through 8.
    - {v1, v2, v3} -> {0, 1, 2}
    - {u1, u2, u3} -> {3, 4, 5}
    - {w1, w2, w3} -> {6, 7, 8}

    The permutation `g` to be tested is a reflection that fixes v1 and swaps v2 and v3.
    - g swaps v2(1) and v3(2).
    - This forces a swap of their corresponding "straight" leaves: u2(4) and u3(5).
    - It also forces a swap of the leaves that are part of the "twisted" structure:
      v2(1) is connected to w1(6).
      v3(2) is connected to w2(7).
      So g must swap w1(6) and w2(7).
