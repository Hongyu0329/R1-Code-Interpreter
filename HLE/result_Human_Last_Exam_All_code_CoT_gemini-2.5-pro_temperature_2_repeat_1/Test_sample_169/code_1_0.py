    1.  The strength of biotic interactions, particularly from parasites and herbivores, is known to be highest in the tropics (low latitudes) and decrease towards the poles (high latitudes). This is due to a stable, warm climate that supports high population densities and year-round activity of parasites.
    2.  Plants defend themselves using chemical compounds, including VOCs. In an 'arms race', intense and diverse parasite pressure at low latitudes selects for individual plants that can produce a more complex and diverse mixture of defensive compounds.
    3.  A higher diversity of VOCs within a single plant (higher α-diversity) provides a more robust defense against a wider array of specialized parasites.
    4.  Therefore, as latitude decreases (moving from 60°N to the equator), the α-diversity of VOCs within a plant is expected to increase. This represents a negative relationship with latitude (as latitude number goes up, diversity goes down).
    
    Conclusion for α-diversity: Negative Effect

    beta_reasoning = """
    1.  β-diversity in this context measures the chemical differentiation among individual plants at the same site.
    2.  At low latitudes with high parasite pressure, if all plants shared the same chemical defense profile (even a complex one), a parasite that evolves to overcome it could devastate the entire population.
    3.  This creates strong selective pressure for 'chemical rarity' or 'chemodiversity' within the plant community. A plant with a different VOC profile than its neighbors is less likely to be attacked by parasites adapted to the more common profile (this is called negative frequency-dependent selection).
    4.  This selection for chemical uniqueness among individuals leads to high turnover or variation in VOC profiles from one plant to the next, resulting in high β-diversity. This pressure is strongest in the tropics.
    5.  Therefore, as latitude decreases, the β-diversity of VOCs within a site is also expected to increase. This also represents a negative relationship with latitude.
