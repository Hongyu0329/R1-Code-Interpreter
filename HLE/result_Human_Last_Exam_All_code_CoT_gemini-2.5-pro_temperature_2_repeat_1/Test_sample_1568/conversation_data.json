    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve for the given infinite product:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Generalization:** The given infinite product is a specific case of a more general formula for products of the form $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{z^k}{n^k}\\right)$.\n2.  **Gamma Function Identity:** This general product can be expressed in a closed form using the Gamma function, based on the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function. The identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{z^k}{n^k}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} \\Gamma(1 - z \\cdot e^{i 2\\pi j / k})} $$\n3.  **Apply to the specific case:** For this problem, we have $k=3$. The roots of unity are $1, e^{i2\\pi/3}, e^{i4\\pi/3}$. So, the product starting from $n=1$ is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z) \\cdot \\Gamma(1-z \\cdot e^{i2\\pi/3}) \\cdot \\Gamma(1-z \\cdot e^{i4\\pi/3})} $$\n4.  **Adjust the starting index:** The requested product starts from $n=3$. To get this, we take the full product (starting from $n=1$) and divide out the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n    *   The term for $n=1$ is $\\left(1 - \\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)$.\n    *   The term for $n=2$ is $\\left(1 - \\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)$.\n5.  **Final Expression:** Combining these pieces gives the final expression. I will provide Python code to construct and print this formula, ensuring all the original numbers are explicitly shown as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to generate the final formula:\n\n```python\ndef generate_formula_string():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and prints the symbolic expression for the infinite product\n    \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right).\n    \n    The code demonstrates how to build the string for the final formula,\n    explicitly including all the numbers from the problem statement as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define string representations for the variable and symbols\n    z_str = \"z\"\n    pi_str = \"pi\"\n    I_str = \"I\"\n    \n    # Left hand side of the equation as given in the problem\n    lhs_str = \"prod_{n=3 to inf}(1 - z**3/n**3)\"\n\n    # Right hand side components\n    # The terms for n=1 and n=2 that are divided out\n    term_n1_str = f\"(1 - {z_str}**3 / 1**3)\"\n    term_n2_str = f\"(1 - {z_str}**3 / 2**3)\"\n\n    # The Gamma function product from the general identity\n    gamma1_str = f\"Gamma(1 - {z_str})\"\n    gamma2_str = f\"Gamma(1 - {z_str}*exp(2*{pi_str}*{I_str}/3))\"\n    gamma3_str = f\"Gamma(1 - {z_str}*exp(4*{pi_str}*{I_str}/3))\"\n    \n    # Full right hand side of the equation\n    rhs_str = f\"1 / ({term_n1_str} * {term_n2_str} * {gamma1_str} * {gamma2_str} * {gamma3_str})\"\n    \n    # Print the final equation\n    print(f\"{lhs_str} = {rhs_str}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    generate_formula_string()\n```\n<<<prod_{n=3 to inf}(1 - z**3/n**3) = 1 / ((1 - z**3 / 1**3) * (1 - z**3 / 2**3) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*I/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*I/3)))>>>"
