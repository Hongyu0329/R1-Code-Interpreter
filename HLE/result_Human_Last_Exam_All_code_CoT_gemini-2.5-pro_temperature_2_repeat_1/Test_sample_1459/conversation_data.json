    "To determine the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval `[0,1]` and the unit circle, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Spaces and their Parameters:**\n    *   **Space X:** The interval `[0, 1]`. Its length, which is also its diameter, is `L = 1`. The metric is the standard absolute value difference, `d(a,b) = |a-b|`.\n    *   **Space Y:** The unit circle. \"Unit circle\" typically refers to a circle with a radius `r = 1`. The \"intrinsic metric\" refers to the shortest path distance along the circumference of the circle. The circumference is `C = 2 * pi * r = 2 * pi`.\n\n2.  **Use the Known Mathematical Formula:**\n    The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between an interval of length `L` and a circle of circumference `C` is a known result in mathematics. The formula depends on the relationship between `C` and `L`:\n    *   If `C >= 2L`, the distance `d_GH` is given by a simple formula: `d_GH = L / 2`.\n    *   If `C < 2L`, the distance is the root of a more complex transcendental equation.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to Our Problem:**\n    *   We have `L = 1` and `C = 2 * pi`.\n    *   We must check the condition `C >= 2L`.\n    *   Substituting the values: `2 * pi >= 2 * 1`, which simplifies to `pi >= 1`.\n    *   Since `pi` (approximately 3.14159) is indeed greater than 1, the condition is met.\n    *   Therefore, we can use the simpler formula: `d_GH = L / 2`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Distance:**\n    *   Substituting `L = 1` into the formula, we get: `d_GH = 1 / 2 = 0.5`.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this calculation. It defines the parameters, checks the condition, and computes the final distance, printing out the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gromov_hausdorff_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval [0,1]\n    and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
