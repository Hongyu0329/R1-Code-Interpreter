    Calculates the critical exponent ν for a Ginzburg-Landau φ⁴ theory
    within the mean-field approximation.

    The question specifies a "G₄-theoretical framework". This is interpreted as
    the standard Ginzburg-Landau φ⁴ theory, a fundamental model in the study of
    critical phenomena. The calculation is performed using mean-field theory, which
    provides an exact description for systems at or above the upper critical dimension (d ≥ 4).
