    This function solves the probability problem.
    The step-by-step derivation shows that the problem reduces to determining if the asymptotic density 'c'
    of the Brownian sausage is greater or less than 2/3.

    The asymptotic density 'c' is given by the limit:
    c = lim_{n->inf} p(n)
    where p(n) is the probability that the path of the process hits a small disk B(n, 1) far from the origin.

    This probability was found to behave as:
    p(n) ~= (exp(-1) * K_0(1)) / ln(n)
    where K_0 is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.

    As n approaches infinity, ln(n) approaches infinity, which means p(n) approaches 0.
    Therefore, the asymptotic density c = 0.

    We need to find lim_{n->inf} P(V_n > 2/3).
    Since V_n converges in probability to c=0, for any epsilon > 0, P(|V_n - 0| >= epsilon) -> 0.
    Let epsilon = 2/3. Then P(V_n >= 2/3) -> 0.
    Thus, the limit is 0.

    The final equation is lim_{n->inf} P(V_n > a/b) = c.
    The numbers in the problem are a=2, b=3. The resulting limit is c=0.
