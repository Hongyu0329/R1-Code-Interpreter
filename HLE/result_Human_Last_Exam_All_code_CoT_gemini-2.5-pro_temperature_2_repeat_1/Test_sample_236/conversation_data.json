    "To solve this problem, I will determine the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group that arise from integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant knots**: The knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1).\n2.  **Understand the surgery**: For the resulting 3-manifold to be an integral homology sphere, the surgery coefficient must be +1 or -1. These are the only cases we need to consider.\n3.  **Analyze each knot**: I will examine the homology spheres produced by +1 and -1 surgery on each of these knots and determine what element they represent in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Unknot (0_1) and Figure-eight (4_1)**: These knots are known to produce the identity element (the 3-sphere S^3 or something homology cobordant to it).\n    *   **Trefoil (3_1)**: This knot is chiral, meaning it's different from its mirror image. Surgeries on the right-handed and left-handed trefoils produce distinct, non-identity elements.\n4.  **Count the unique elements**: I will sum the number of unique elements found from each type of knot. The Python script below will walk through this logic and calculate the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the homology cobordism group\n    representable by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n    This script explains the result based on established theorems in knot theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The task is to find how many unique elements of the homology cobordism group can be made from integral surgery on knots with at most 4 crossings.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the knots and surgery type.\")\n    print(\" - Knots with at most 4 crossings are: the Unknot (0_1), the Trefoil (3_1), and the Figure-eight (4_1).\")\n    print(\" - 'Integral surgery' on a knot K to get a homology sphere means performing a +1 or -1 surgery on K.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyze the elements generated by each type of knot.\")\n    \n    # Contribution from the unknot and figure-eight knot.\n    # Both of these knots produce the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n    # - Surgery on the unknot yields the 3-sphere, S^3, which is the identity.\n    # - The figure-eight knot is amphichiral and slice, so surgery on it yields\n    #   a homology sphere that is homology cobordant to S^3, representing the identity.\n    print(\" - The Unknot and the Figure-eight knot both produce homology spheres that represent the identity element of the group.\")\n    identity_contribution = 1\n    print(f\"   These knots contribute {identity_contribution} unique element (the identity).\")\n\n    # Contribution from the trefoil knot.\n    # The trefoil is chiral, so its right-handed (RHT) and left-handed (LHT) versions yield different results.\n    print(\"\\n - The Trefoil knot (3_1) is chiral (it is different from its mirror image).\")\n    print(\"   - (+1) surgery on the right-handed trefoil gives the Poincar√© sphere class, [P], which has infinite order.\")\n    print(\"   - (-1) surgery on the left-handed trefoil gives its distinct inverse, [P]^-1.\")\n    print(\"   - (-1) surgery on the right-handed trefoil gives a different element of order 2.\")\n    trefoil_contribution = 3\n    print(f\"   The trefoil knot and its mirror contribute {trefoil_contribution} new, unique elements.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Sum the contributions to find the total.\")\n    total = identity_contribution + trefoil_contribution\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is the sum of unique elements from each source:\")\n    # We print each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{identity_contribution} (from unknot/figure-eight) + {trefoil_contribution} (from trefoil) = {total}\")\n\nsolve_homology_cobordism()\n<<<4>>>"
