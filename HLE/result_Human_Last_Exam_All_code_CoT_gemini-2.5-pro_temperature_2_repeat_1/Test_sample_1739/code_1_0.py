def calculate_nonlinear_frequency_term():
    """
    This function calculates the third term of the nonlinear frequency correction coefficient.
    The nonlinear frequency shift coefficient 'S' is a function of gamma.
    S = K / (8 * omega_0**2) where K is the coefficient of the cubic nonlinearity
    in the amplitude evolution equation, and omega_0**2 = 3*gamma.
    
    The coefficient K has been derived as:
    K = (45*gamma**3 - 99*gamma**2 - 72*gamma - 12) / 4

    Thus, the frequency shift coefficient is:
    S = (45*gamma**3 - 99*gamma**2 - 72*gamma - 12) / (32 * (3*gamma))
      = (45*gamma**3 - 99*gamma**2 - 72*gamma - 12) / (96*gamma)
      = (15/32)*gamma**2 - (33/32)*gamma - (24/32) - (4/(32*gamma))
    
    The terms are ordered by the power of gamma. The third term is the constant term.
