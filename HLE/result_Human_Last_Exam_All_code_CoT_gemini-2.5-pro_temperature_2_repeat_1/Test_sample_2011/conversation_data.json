    "My plan to solve this problem involves a logical deduction about the properties of cliques in graphs, rather than a computational search. Here are the steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The goal is to find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as *induced subgraphs* in a graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n2.  **Analyze the set of clique sizes:** Let's denote `S(G)` as the set of integers `k` for which an induced clique of size `k` (a `K_k`) exists in a given graph `G`. The problem asks for the maximum value of `|S(G)|` over all graphs `G` with 128 vertices.\n3.  **Identify the key property:** I will show that for any graph `G`, the set `S(G)` is always a contiguous range of integers, `S(G) = {1, 2, ..., K}`. This is because if a graph contains an induced clique of size `k`, it must also contain an induced clique of size `k-1`. This smaller clique can be found by simply removing any single vertex from the vertex set of the size-`k` clique.\n4.  **Simplify the problem:** Based on the property above, the number of different clique sizes `|S(G)|` is equal to the size of the largest induced clique in `G`. This is, by definition, the clique number of the graph, denoted as `ω(G)`. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of `ω(G)` for a graph with `n=128` vertices.\n5.  **Solve the simplified problem:** A clique is a set of vertices, so its size cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, for any graph `G` on `n` vertices, `ω(G) ≤ n`.\n6.  **Find the maximum:** This maximum value is achievable. The complete graph on `n` vertices, `K_n`, has a clique number of exactly `n`. In `K_128`, we can find induced cliques of all sizes from 1 up to 128.\n7.  **Final Answer Construction:** The Python code will formalize this reasoning and print the final answer, which is `n = 128`.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes\n# that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph\n# on n = 128 vertices.\n\n# Step 1: Define the number of vertices.\nn = 128\n\n# Step 2: Understand the property of induced cliques.\n# Let S be the set of sizes of induced cliques in a graph G.\n# If k is a size in S (where k > 1), it means there is a set of k vertices\n# that forms a complete graph K_k as an induced subgraph.\n# By removing any one vertex from this set, we get a new set of k-1 vertices.\n# Since the original k vertices were all connected to each other, the k-1\n# vertices in the subset are also all connected to each other.\n# Thus, they form an induced clique of size k-1.\n# This proves that if k is in S, then k-1 is also in S.\n#\n# It follows that the set of induced clique sizes S for any graph\n# is always a continuous set of integers: S = {1, 2, 3, ..., k_max},\n# where k_max is the size of the largest induced clique in the graph.\n# The number of different clique sizes is therefore k_max.\n\n# Step 3: Reduce the problem.\n# The problem is now to find the maximum possible value of k_max for a graph\n# with n vertices. k_max is also known as the clique number, omega(G).\n\n# Step 4: Solve the reduced problem.\n# A clique of size k requires k distinct vertices. For a graph with n vertices,\n# the largest possible clique can have at most n vertices.\n# The maximum is achieved by the complete graph, K_n, where all n vertices\n# form a clique. In this graph, any subset of k vertices (for 1 <= k <= n)\n# forms an induced clique of size k.\n\n# Step 5: State the final conclusion for n=128.\n# For a graph with 128 vertices, the maximum clique number is 128.\n# Therefore, the maximum number of different clique sizes is also 128.\n\n# Final Equation:\n# Maximum number of different clique sizes = n\nresult = n\n\nprint(f\"The number of vertices in the graph is n = {n}.\")\nprint(\"The analysis shows that the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is equal to the number of vertices, n.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the final answer is {result}.\")\n```\n<<<128>>>"
