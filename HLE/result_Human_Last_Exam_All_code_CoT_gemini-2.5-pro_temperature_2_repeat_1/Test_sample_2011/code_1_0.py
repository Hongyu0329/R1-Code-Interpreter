# The problem is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes
# that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph
# on n = 128 vertices.

# Step 1: Define the number of vertices.
n = 128

# Step 2: Understand the property of induced cliques.
# Let S be the set of sizes of induced cliques in a graph G.
# If k is a size in S (where k > 1), it means there is a set of k vertices
# that forms a complete graph K_k as an induced subgraph.
# By removing any one vertex from this set, we get a new set of k-1 vertices.
# Since the original k vertices were all connected to each other, the k-1
# vertices in the subset are also all connected to each other.
# Thus, they form an induced clique of size k-1.
# This proves that if k is in S, then k-1 is also in S.
#
# It follows that the set of induced clique sizes S for any graph
# is always a continuous set of integers: S = {1, 2, 3, ..., k_max},
# where k_max is the size of the largest induced clique in the graph.
# The number of different clique sizes is therefore k_max.

# Step 3: Reduce the problem.
# The problem is now to find the maximum possible value of k_max for a graph
# with n vertices. k_max is also known as the clique number, omega(G).

# Step 4: Solve the reduced problem.
# A clique of size k requires k distinct vertices. For a graph with n vertices,
# the largest possible clique can have at most n vertices.
# The maximum is achieved by the complete graph, K_n, where all n vertices
# form a clique. In this graph, any subset of k vertices (for 1 <= k <= n)
# forms an induced clique of size k.

# Step 5: State the final conclusion for n=128.
# For a graph with 128 vertices, the maximum clique number is 128.
# Therefore, the maximum number of different clique sizes is also 128.

# Final Equation:
# Maximum number of different clique sizes = n
result = n
