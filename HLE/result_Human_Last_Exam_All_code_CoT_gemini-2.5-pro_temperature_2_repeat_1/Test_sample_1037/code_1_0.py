    This function determines the cardinalities of S/A, B/S, and H_1(B/A, Q).

    - Beth_2: Cardinality of 2^Beth_1, e.g., the set of hyperreal numbers.

    Our analysis leads to the following conclusions:
    1.  The initial object A is the scale a: Z -> Z, a(1)=1.
    2.  The terminal object B is the scale b: Z -> R, b(1)=1.
    3.  The scale S is s: Z -> *R (hyperreals), s(1)=1.

    # 1. Cardinality of S/A

    # The number of cosets is |*R / Z| = |*R| = Beth_2.

    # 2. Cardinality of B/S
    # B/S corresponds to the group quotient R / Im(f_SB), where f_SB: *R -> R.
    # The canonical morphism f_SB is a projection (like the standard part map)
    # that is surjective onto R.
    # Thus, Im(f_SB) = R. The quotient R/R is the trivial group {0}.
    # Its cardinality is 1.

    # 3. Cardinality of H_1(B/A, Q)
    # B/A corresponds to the quotient space R / Z, which is topologically a circle (S^1).
    # The first homology group with rational coefficients is H_1(S^1, Q) which is isomorphic to Q.
    # The cardinality of Q is Aleph_0, which is Beth_0.
