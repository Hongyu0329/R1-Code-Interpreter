    Patient: 78-year-old farmer.

    Key Findings: Gouty tophi and masses in both hands, confirmed by exam and imaging.

    1. The central finding in this case is the presence of gouty tophi.
    2. Gout is a systemic disease caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in tissues, especially in and around joints.
    3. This deposition leads to an intense inflammatory response, causing pain, swelling, and joint destruction. This entire process is, by definition, a form of inflammatory arthritis.
    4. While the masses (tophi) could secondarily cause nerve compression (neuropathy), the primary pathological process and anatomical abnormality described is the gouty arthritis itself.
    5. Therefore, 'arthritis of the wrist' is the most accurate and direct answer describing the condition.
