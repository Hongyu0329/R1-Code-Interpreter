# 1. Define the elliptic curve E and find its rank r
# The curve y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10x - 20 is known by its Cremona label '49a1'.
E = EllipticCurve('49a1')
r = E.rank()

# 2. Find the cubic primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 7
# For prime conductor N=7, any non-trivial character is primitive.
# The group of characters is cyclic of order phi(7)=6.
# We need characters of order 3. There are two such characters.
G = DirichletGroup(7, base_ring=CDF) # CDF is the Complex Double Field for numerical evaluation
cubic_chars = [chi for chi in G if chi.order() == 3]
chi1 = cubic_chars[0]
chi2 = cubic_chars[1] # chi2 is the complex conjugate of chi1

# 3. Compute the leading coefficients a and b at s=1.
# The analytic ranks of the twisted L-series are 0,
# so the leading coefficients are just the L-values at s=1.
# SageMath can compute these values.
a = E.lseries(chi1).value(1)
b = E.lseries(chi2).value(1)

# 4. Calculate the sum r + a + b
# Due to numerical precision, the result might have a tiny imaginary part.
# Since r is real and b is the conjugate of a, the true sum is real.
# We take the real part of the computed sum.
total_sum = r + a + b
real_total_sum = total_sum.real()

# 5. Print the components and the final result.

print(f"The leading coefficient a is L(E, s, chi1) at s=1: a = {a}")
print(f"The leading coefficient b is L(E, s, chi2) at s=1: b = {b}")
print(f"The sum r + a + b is {r} + ({a}) + ({b})")
# We use the computed real part of the sum for the final values
print(f"The numerical value of the sum is: {real_total_sum}")

rounded_result = round(real_total_sum, 4)
