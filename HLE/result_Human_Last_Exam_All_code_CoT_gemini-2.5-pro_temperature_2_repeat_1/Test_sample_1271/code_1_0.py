    # distinct lines L_u and L_v intersect at the zero function {O}.
    class_1 = "A single point."

    # Class 2: A ray
    # This occurs when two geodesics share exactly one direction. For example, the
    # intersection of a line L_u and a bent geodesic B_{u,v} (where v is not
    # collinear with u) is the ray R(u).

    # This occurs when a line geodesic L_u intersects with itself. The intersection is the line itself.
    class_3 = "A line, homeomorphic to the real line R."

    # Class 4: A bent geodesic
    # This occurs when a bent geodesic intersects with itself. The intersection is the
    # bent geodesic itself, which is a union of two rays not forming a line.
