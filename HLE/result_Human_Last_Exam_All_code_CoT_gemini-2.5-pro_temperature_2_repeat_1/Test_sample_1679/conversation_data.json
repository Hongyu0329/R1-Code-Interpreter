    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the movie:\n\nFirst, I need to determine the real-world locations of the Luxor Obelisks. There are two: one stands at the Luxor Temple in Egypt, and its twin is in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n\nNext, I will search through the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture chronologically. For each film, I'll determine its setting.\n\nThe first film on the list that is set in either Paris or Luxor and is confirmed to depict the respective landmark on-screen will be the answer. I will write a Python script that contains a list of early Best Picture winners and their settings, then iterates through this list to find the first match.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    This function contains a curated list of early Best Picture winners and their\n    settings.
