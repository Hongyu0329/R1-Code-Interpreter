    "The process of gene duplication creates redundant genetic material. The ultimate fate of these duplicated genes is a central question in evolutionary biology. The question asks for the most likely mechanism responsible for both the *retention* (keeping the duplicate gene in the genome) and *divergence* (the two copies becoming different over time).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the options:\n1.  **Analyze the possible fates of a duplicated gene:**\n    *   **Nonfunctionalization (Pseudogenization):** One copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. This is the most common fate, but it represents a *loss*, not a mechanism for functional retention and divergence.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization:** One copy retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that confer a brand new function. This leads to retention (original function is preserved, new function might be advantageous) and divergence.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization:** The ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy loses a different part of the ancestral function through mutation. As a result, both copies are now required to fulfill the original set of functions. This model, also known as Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC), strongly favors retention and also leads to divergence as the genes specialize.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the answer choices against this framework:**\n    *   A. Gene conversion: This process homogenizes sequences, working *against* divergence.\n    *   B. Pseudogenization: This is the loss of a gene, not its retention in a functional state.\n    *   E. Adaptive radiation: This is a macro-evolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level.\n    *   This leaves us with C. Neofunctionalization and D. Subfunctionalization, both of which are valid mechanisms for retention and divergence.\n\n3.  **Determine the \"most likely\" mechanism:** The key challenge for a duplicated gene is surviving the initial period where it is redundant and likely to be lost via pseudogenization. The neofunctionalization model requires a rare, beneficial mutation to occur for the new copy to be preserved. The subfunctionalization model, however, provides an immediate selective pressure to keep *both* copies, as they partition essential ancestral functions. Because this mechanism relies on the much more common occurrence of degenerative (but complementary) mutations, it is thought to be a major, and perhaps more frequent, reason for the initial retention of duplicate genes observed across so many genomes. It provides a passive route to preservation that doesn't require waiting for a rare advantageous event. Therefore, it's considered a highly likely mechanism for retention and subsequent divergence.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, the following Python script provides a simple conceptual model of the different fates a duplicated gene can experience.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef simulate_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script conceptually models the primary fates of a duplicated gene\n    to illustrate why subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization are\n    key mechanisms for retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
