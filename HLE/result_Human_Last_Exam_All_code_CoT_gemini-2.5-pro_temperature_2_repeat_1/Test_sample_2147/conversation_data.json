    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to identify the key figure, Pavel Milyukov, and the context of his statement. He was a prominent Russian liberal politician and historian.\n2.  Next, I will research his critiques of culture during his time, specifically looking for the quote where he denounces a group or movement as a 'stagnant swamp'.\n3.  The term \"X-Y\" suggests a two-word name. I will search for a two-word term associated with his criticisms.\n4.  Historical sources indicate Milyukov was a rationalist and positivist who was highly critical of the emerging modernist and Symbolist movements in Russian arts and literature at the turn of the 20th century.\n5.  I have identified the specific group he was denouncing. I will now write a simple Python script to print this answer, as per your instructions.\n\n```python\ndef find_milyukovs_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the group Pavel Milyukov\n    famously denounced as a 'stagnant swamp'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov, a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets),\n    # was a rationalist and historian who viewed the rising tide of\n    # modernism and mysticism in Russian culture with disdain.\n    \n    # The term he used, represented as X-Y in the question, was \"Symbolist poets\".\n    x = \"Symbolist\"\n    y = \"poets\"\n    \n    # The script will now print the answer.\n    print(f\"Pavel Milyukov denounced {x}-{y} as a 'stagnant swamp'.\")\n\nfind_milyukovs_target()\n```\n<<<Symbolist poets>>>"
