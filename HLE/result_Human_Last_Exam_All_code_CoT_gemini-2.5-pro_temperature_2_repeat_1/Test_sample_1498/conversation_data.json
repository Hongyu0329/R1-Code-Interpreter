    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n1.  First, I need to identify the content of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' to locate the specific section where the names of the Prophets are listed.\n2.  I will identify the starting line number (bayt) where the list begins and the ending line number where the list concludes.\n3.  I will then create a Python script that stores these start and end numbers in variables.\n4.  Finally, the script will print a formatted sentence that clearly states the range of the bayt numbers, as requested, showing each number in the final output.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_section_in_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of lines (bayt)\n    in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the standard text of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi,\n    # the poem enumerates the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an.\n    # The actual list of names starts after the introductory bayt about their number.\n\n    # Bayt 30 is the first line that contains names: \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud...\"\n    start_bayt = 30\n\n    # Bayt 35 is the last line that contains names: \"...and al-Yasa', Yunus, Lut, each one has come to pass.\"\n    # Bayt 36 offers a concluding prayer for them all but does not list new names.\n    end_bayt = 35\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from:\")\n    # The final output is formatted to show the equation of the range clearly.\n    print(f\"Start Bayt: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(\"to\")\n    print(f\"End Bayt: {end_bayt}\")\n\n\nfind_prophets_section_in_poem()\n```\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 35>>>"
