    "The problem asks for the Chern number of a composite system formed by two Chern insulators. The Chern number is a topological invariant, and for non-interacting systems, it is an additive quantity. When two topological systems are combined, the Chern number of the resulting system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the Chern number for the first insulator, C1.\n2.  Define the Chern number for the second insulator, C2.\n3.  Calculate the total Chern number, C_total, by summing C1 and C2.\n4.  Print the calculation as an equation.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number.\n# When two Chern insulators are joined together, the Chern number\n# of the composite system is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\n\n# Chern number of the first insulator\nc1 = 1\n\n# Chern number of the second insulator\nc2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the total Chern number of the junction\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the first insulator is {c1}.\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the second insulator is {c2}.\")\nprint(\"The total Chern number of the junction is the sum of the two.\")\nprint(f\"Final calculation: {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 that connects laterally and have negligible tunneling barrier, what is the Chern number of this junction. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
