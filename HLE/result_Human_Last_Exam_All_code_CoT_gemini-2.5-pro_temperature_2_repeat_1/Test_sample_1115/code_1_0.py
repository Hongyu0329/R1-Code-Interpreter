    Solves the quantum entanglement problem based on the conservation of angular momentum.
    
    The problem describes a two-photon emission from a J=0 -> J=1 -> J=0 atomic cascade.
    In such a system, the law of conservation of angular momentum dictates that
    the total angular momentum of the two emitted photons must be zero, as the atom
    starts and ends in a J=0 state.
    
    This results in the two photons being in an entangled state with opposite polarizations.
    If one is measured as Right-handed, the other must be Left-handed.
