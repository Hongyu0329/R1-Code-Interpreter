    "Of course. To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a d=3 system using the epsilon expansion, we can follow these steps.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the framework:** The epsilon (ϵ) expansion is a technique in renormalization group theory to calculate critical exponents near the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For the universality class containing the Ising model, `d_c = 4`.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (ϵ):** The expansion parameter is `ϵ = d_c - d`. For our case, `d = 3`, so `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3.  **State the Formula:** The formula for the specific heat exponent `α` to the first order in `ϵ` for a system with an `n`-component order parameter is:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Assume Universality Class:** The problem does not specify the number of components `n` for the order parameter. We will assume the system belongs to the most common universality class, the Ising model, where `n=1`.\n5.  **Calculate α:** Substitute the values of `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into the formula and compute the result.\n\nThe following Python code will carry out this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat exponent alpha (α) for a d=3 system\n    using a first-order epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the calculation\n    d = 3      # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4    # Upper critical dimension\n    n = 1      # Number of order parameter components (assuming the Ising model)\n\n    # Explanation of the method\n    print(\"Calculating the specific heat exponent alpha (α) for a d=3 system.\")\n    print(\"The calculation uses a first-order epsilon expansion near the upper critical dimension.\")\n    print(f\"We assume the system is in the Ising universality class (n={n} component order parameter).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the expansion parameter epsilon (ϵ)\")\n    print(f\"ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate alpha using the first-order formula\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the formula for α to first order in ϵ\")\n    print(\"α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n    print(f\"Plugging in n={n} and ϵ={epsilon}:\")\n    \n    # Show the calculation step-by-step\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator_part1 = 2\n    denominator_part2 = n + 8\n    denominator = denominator_part1 * denominator_part2\n    \n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / ({denominator_part1} * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / ({denominator_part1} * {denominator_part2}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n\n    # Calculate final result as a fraction and a float\n    alpha_fraction = fractions.Fraction(numerator, denominator) * epsilon\n    alpha_float = float(alpha_fraction)\n    \n    print(f\"α = {alpha_fraction.numerator}/{alpha_fraction.denominator}\")\n    print(f\"As a decimal, α ≈ {alpha_float}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
