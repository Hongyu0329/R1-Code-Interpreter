    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule:** The starting material is \"di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide\". A disulfide bond (R-S-S-R) is typically reduced by cleaving the S-S bond, resulting in two thiol molecules (2 R-SH). Therefore, the major reduction product is **perylene-3-thiol**.\n\n2.  **Build the Molecular Graph:** I will use the chemical informatics library `rdkit` to create the structure of perylene-3-thiol from its SMILES string. Crucially, as requested (\"including H\"), I will add all hydrogen atoms to the structure, making them nodes in our graph. This `rdkit` object will then be converted into a `networkx` graph, which is ideal for topological calculations.\n\n3.  **Define and Calculate Topological Indices:**\n    *   **Wiener Index (W):** This is the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the molecular graph. I'll compute this by finding all-pairs shortest paths and summing them.\n    *   **Szeged Index (Sz):** This index is calculated over the edges of the graph. For each edge `e` connecting atoms `u` and `v`, we find the number of atoms closer to `u` than to `v` (`n_u`) and the number of atoms closer to `v` than to `u` (`n_v`). The Szeged index is the sum of the products `n_u * n_v` for all edges in the graph.\n\n4.  **Compute the Ratio:** Once both indices are calculated, I will compute the final Szeged/Wiener ratio and display the result, including the equation with the calculated values as requested.\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef calculate_indices_and_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Wiener and Szeged indices for perylene-3-thiol and their ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecule using its SMILES representation.\n    # The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol.\n    # The SMILES string C1=CC=C2C3=C4C=CC(=C4C5=CC=CC(C5=C2)=C13)S corresponds to perylene-3-thiol.\n    smiles = 'C1=CC=C2C3=C4C=CC(=C4C5=CC=CC(C5=C2)=C13)S'\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n\n    # Step 2: Add explicit hydrogen atoms to the molecule graph as requested.\n    mol_with_hs = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n\n    # Step 3: Convert the RDKit molecule object to a NetworkX graph.\n    # Atoms become nodes and bonds become edges.\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    for atom in mol_with_hs.GetAtoms():\n        G.add_node(atom.GetIdx())\n    for bond in mol_with_hs.GetBonds():\n        G.add_edge(bond.GetBeginAtomIdx(), bond.GetEndAtomIdx())\n\n    num_atoms = G.number_of_nodes()\n    \n    # Pre-compute all-pairs shortest paths, which are needed for both indices.\n    all_path_lengths = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Wiener Index (W).\n    # W is the sum of distances between all unique pairs of nodes.\n    wiener_index = 0\n    nodes = list(G.nodes())\n    for i in range(len(nodes)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(nodes)):\n            wiener_index += all_path_lengths[nodes[i]][nodes[j]]\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the Szeged Index (Sz).\n    # For each edge (u, v), count nodes closer to u (n_u) and closer to v (n_v),\n    # then sum the products n_u * n_v.\n    szeged_index = 0\n    for u, v in G.edges():\n        n_u = 0\n        n_v = 0\n        for w in G.nodes():\n            dist_w_u = all_path_lengths[w][u]\n            dist_w_v = all_path_lengths[w][v]\n            if dist_w_u < dist_w_v:\n                n_u += 1\n            elif dist_w_v < dist_w_u:\n                n_v += 1\n        szeged_index += n_u * n_v\n\n    # Step 6: Compute the ratio and print the final results.\n    if wiener_index == 0:\n        ratio = 0\n    else:\n        ratio = szeged_index / wiener_index\n\n    print(f\"The analysis is for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, which is perylene-3-thiol.\")\n    print(f\"The molecular graph contains {num_atoms} atoms (C, S, and all H atoms).\")\n    print(\"\\nSzeged Index (Sz): An edge-based topological index.\")\n    print(\"Wiener Index (W): A distance-based topological index (sum of all shortest paths).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the Szeged/Wiener ratio is:\")\n    print(f\"{szeged_index} / {wiener_index} = {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        calculate_indices_and_ratio()\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Please install required libraries: pip install rdkit-pypi networkx\")\n\n<<<11190 / 9294 = 1.203998278459221>>>"
