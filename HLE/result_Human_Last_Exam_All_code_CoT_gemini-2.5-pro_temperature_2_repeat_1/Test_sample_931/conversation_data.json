    "To answer your question, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  First, I will analyze the core biological question about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies).\n2.  I will consult entomological knowledge about the feeding habits of these insects.\n3.  Then, I will evaluate each provided answer choice based on this information, paying close attention to the *type* of food described (e.g., nectar, aphids, leaf tissue).\n4.  I'll determine which food types are correctly associated with adult snakeflies.\n5.  Finally, I will select the multiple-choice option that most accurately and completely describes their diet from the given choices. The process and conclusion will be presented within a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# This script is designed to logically deduce the answer to the multiple-choice question.\n\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidioptera (snakeflies) to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following have Raphidiopterans been recorded feeding on as adults?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen',\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue',\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids',\n        'F': 'A and E',\n        'G': 'D and E'\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the question: '{question}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the known diet of adult Raphidioptera.\n    print(\"Step 1: Scientific Facts about the Diet of Adult Snakeflies (Raphidioptera)\")\n    print(\"- Adult snakeflies are primarily predatory.\")\n    print(\"- Their main prey consists of small, soft-bodied insects, such as aphids.\")\n    print(\"- In addition to predation, some species are known to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\")\n    print(\"- They are not known to be herbivorous (feeding on leaf tissue) or fungivorous (feeding on fungus).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each primary option based on these facts.\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the primary food sources from the options list.\")\n    \n    # Analysis of A\n    is_a_correct = True\n    print(f\"Option A ({options['A']}): CORRECT.
