    "This is a poker theory question. To answer it, we need to consult a GTO (Game Theory Optimal) pre-flop opening range for the specified game conditions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the situation:** The game is a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game. The position is the Button (BTN), which is the last position to act pre-flop (before the blinds). The action is an open-raise.\n2.  **Determine the BTN opening range:** In a rake-free environment, the BTN's opening range is extremely wide, often exceeding 50% of all possible hands. This is because there is no rake penalty, making it more profitable to contest the blinds.\n3.  **Identify all suited Jack (JXs) hands in the range:** In such a wide opening range, all suited Jacks, from J2s all the way to JAs, are considered standard opens.\n4.  **Find the \"worst\" hand:** The \"worst\" hand in a category is typically the one with the weakest kicker and the least connectivity. Among all suited Jacks, J2s has the lowest kicker and weakest straight-making potential. Therefore, it is the worst suited jack that is still a profitable open-raise from the button in this format.\n\nThe following Python code will print the abbreviated name of this hand.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game.\n\n    In a rake-free game, the button's opening range is very wide,\n    including all suited Jacks from J2s to JAs. The \"worst\" of these,\n    based on kicker strength, is J2s.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In a very wide button opening range (common in rake-free games), all suited Jacks are opened.\n    # The full list of suited Jacks is: JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    # The worst hand in this list (the one with the lowest equity) is the one with the lowest kicker.\n    worst_suited_jack = \"J2s\"\n\n    print(f\"The worst suited jack to open from the button in this scenario is: {worst_suited_jack}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_to_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
