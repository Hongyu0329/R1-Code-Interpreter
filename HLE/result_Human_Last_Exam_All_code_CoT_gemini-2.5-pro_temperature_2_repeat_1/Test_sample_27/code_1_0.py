# Plan:
# 1. Define the lists of significant contributors for B cells and T cells based on the analysis above.
#    - B cells: Technical errors (doublets, ambient RNA) and biological mechanisms 
#      (leaky exclusion, receptor editing) are all significant. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
#    - T cells: Technical errors are significant, and all listed biological scenarios 
#      are also significant due to the high frequency and unique mechanisms of 
#      TCR alpha chain rearrangement. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
# 2. Format these lists into the required string format: "(num1,num2,...), (num1,num2,...)"
# 3. Print the final formatted string.

# Step 1: Define the lists of causes
b_cell_causes = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
t_cell_causes = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Step 2: Format the lists into strings
# The str() function is called on each number in the tuple,
# and they are then joined together by a comma.
b_cell_str = ",".join(map(str, b_cell_causes))
t_cell_str = ",".join(map(str, t_cell_causes))

# Step 3: Combine the strings into the final format and print
# An f-string is used to place the comma-separated number strings inside parentheses.
final_answer_string = f"({b_cell_str}), ({t_cell_str})"

print(final_answer_string)
<<<({b_cell_str}), ({t_cell_str})>>>
