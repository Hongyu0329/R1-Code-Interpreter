    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Rules:** The chessboard is a 5x5 grid that wraps around both horizontally and vertically (a torus). We need to place 4 queens such that no two queens can attack each other. On a toroidal board, two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if any of these conditions are met:\n    *   **Same Row:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Same Column:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Same Diagonals:** The diagonal check on a toroidal board is `(r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5` or `(r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`.\n\n2.  **Method:** A straightforward and reliable way to solve this is to check every possible placement of 4 queens on the 25 squares. The total number of ways to choose 4 squares from 25 is C(25, 4), which equals 12,650. This number is small enough for a computer to iterate through quickly.\n\n3.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   Represent the 5x5 board as a set of 25 coordinate pairs, from `(0, 0)` to `(4, 4)`.\n    *   Use Python's `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible sets of 4 squares.\n    *   For each combination of 4 squares:\n        *   Check if any pair of queens placed on these squares attacks each other using the toroidal rules defined above.\n        *   If no two queens in the set attack each other, it's a valid placement. We'll count it.\n    *   Keep a running total of the valid placements.\n    *   Finally, print the total count.\n\nThis brute-force method is guaranteed to be correct as it exhaustively checks every single possibility against the rules.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place K non-attacking queens on a\n    toroidal NxN chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # The size of the board (NxN)\n    K = 4  # The number of queens to place\n\n    # A list of all possible squares on the board, e.g., [(0, 0), (0, 1), ...]\n    all_squares = list(itertools.product(range(N), repeat=2))\n\n    # This will store the final count of valid placements\n    valid_placements_count = 0\n\n    # Generate all possible ways to choose K squares out of the N*N available squares\n    for queen_placement in itertools.combinations(all_squares, K):\n        is_valid = True\n        # For a given placement of K queens, we must check every pair of queens\n        # to see if they attack each other.\n        for q1, q2 in itertools.combinations(queen_placement, 2):\n            r1, c1 = q1\n            r2, c2 = q2\n\n            # Check for attacks based on toroidal rules\n            # 1. Same row or same column\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n            # 2.
