    # Step 1 & 2: Simplify the determinant of the matrix N.
    # The matrix N is a 1011x1011 block lower triangular matrix:
    # N = [[A, 0], [B, D]]
    # where A is a 3x3 matrix, D is the 1008x1008 identity matrix.
    # So, det(N) = det(A) * det(D) = det(A).
    #
    # The 3x3 matrix A is:
    # A = [[2N1+2N4-N3-N2, 2N3+2N2-N1-N4-1, 1-N3-N2],
    #      [2N1+4N4-N3-2N2, 2N3+4N2-N1-2N4-2, 2-N3-2N2],
    #      [2N1+4N4-N3-2N2, 2N3+4N2-N1-2N4-3, 2-N3-2N2]]
    # Subtracting the second row from the third gives (0, -1, 0).
    # det(A) simplifies to det([[N_{11}, N_{13}], [N_{21}, N_{23}}]]), which is:
    # (2*N1+2*N4-N3-N2)*(2-N3-2*N2) - (1-N3-N2)*(2*N1+4*N4-N3-2*N2)
    # This expression simplifies to X = 2*N1*(1-N2) + N3*(2*N4-1).
    
    # Step 3 & 4: Simplify the expression for phi(a).
    # The expression for phi(a) simplifies to:
    # phi(a) = pi * (E[|X|] + 2*P(X>a) - 1)
    # where X = det(N). This holds because X has a symmetric distribution about 0.
