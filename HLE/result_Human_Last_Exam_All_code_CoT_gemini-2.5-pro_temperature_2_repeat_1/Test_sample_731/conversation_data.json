    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$. Its structure is defined by the presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup is a subgroup $H$ formed by taking the $k$-th power of every element in the main group $G$, i.e., $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. The set of all power subgroups is identical to the set $\\{G^d\\}$, where $d$ is a divisor of the group's exponent.\n3.  **Determine the Group Exponent**: The exponent of a group is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of all its elements.\n    *   The elements are of the form $r^i$ (where $0 \\le i < 256$) and $sr^j$ (where $0 \\le j < 256$).\n    *   The order of the element $r$ is 256. The orders of its powers, $r^i$, are divisors of 256.\n    *   The order of an element $sr^j$ is found by computing its powers. We have $(sr^j)^2 = r^{128j}$. If $j$ is even, $(sr^j)^2=e$, so its order is 2. If $j$ is odd, $(sr^j)^2 = r^{128}$ (which has order 2), so $(sr^j)^4=e$, and its order is 4.\n    *   The orders of elements in $SD_{512}$ are therefore $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, \\dots, 256\\}$. The LCM of these orders is 256. So, the exponent of $SD_{512}$ is 256.\n4.  **Identify and Count Distinct Power Subgroups**: We need to find the number of distinct subgroups $G^d$ for all divisors $d$ of 256. The divisors of $256 = 2^8$ are $d=2^m$ for $m=0, 1, \\dots, 8$.\n5.  **Characterize Each Subgroup**: We will now examine each of these 9 potential power subgroups.\n    *   For $m=0$, $d=1$: $G^1$ is the group $G$ itself, $SD_{512}$.\n    *   For $m \\ge 1$, $d=2^m$ is even. The subgroup $G^d$ consists of elements $\\{(r^i)^d\\} \\cup \\{(sr^j)^d\\}$.\n        *   The set $\\{(r^i)^d\\}$ is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^d \\rangle = \\langle r^{2^m} \\rangle$.\n        *   The powers $(sr^j)^d$ evaluate to $r^{j \\cdot 2^{m+6} \\pmod{256}}$.\n        *   For $m=1$, this gives $\\{e, r^{128}\\}$, which is contained in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n        *   For $m \\ge 2$, this always results in the identity element $e$.\n    *   Therefore, for $m \\ge 1$, the power subgroup $G^{2^m}$ is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^m} \\rangle$.\n6.  **Final Count**: By listing the identified subgroups and their orders, we can confirm they are distinct and count them.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to derive the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n    \n    # In SD_{2^n}, the generator r has order 2^(n-1)\n    r_order = 2**(n - 1)\n    \n    # The exponent of SD_{2^n} is 2^(n-1)\n    exponent = r_order\n    \n    print(f\"The semidihedral group is SD_{group_order} = SD_{{2**n}}.\")\n    print(f\"The group presentation is <r, s | r^{r_order} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{{{2**(n-2)-1}}}>.\")\n    print(f\"The exponent of the group is {exponent}.\")\n    \n    # The power subgroups are G^d where d divides the exponent.\n    # Divisors of exponent = 2^(n-1) are 2^m for m = 0, 1, ..., n-1\n    num_divisors = n\n    \n    subgroups = []\n    \n    # Case m=0, d=1\n    d = 1\n    subgroup_desc = f\"G^{d} = SD_{group_order}\"\n    subgroup_order = group_order\n    subgroups.append({'d': d, 'description': subgroup_desc, 'order': subgroup_order})\n    \n    # Cases m = 1 to n-1\n    for m in range(1, n):\n        d = 2**m\n        subgroup_desc = f\"G^{d} = <r^{d}>\"\n        subgroup_order = r_order // d\n        subgroups.append({'d': d, 'description': subgroup_desc, 'order': subgroup_order})\n        \n    print(\"\\nThe distinct power subgroups are:\")\n    for i, sg in enumerate(subgroups):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {sg['description']:<15} (Order: {sg['order']})\")\n        \n    count_non_cyclic = 1\n    count_cyclic = len(subgroups) - 1\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThere is {count_non_cyclic} non-cyclic power subgroup (the group itself) and {count_cyclic} distinct cyclic power subgroups.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of power subgroups is {count_non_cyclic} + {count_cyclic} = {len(subgroups)}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
