    "Of course. Here is a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ for a $1s$ Slater orbital.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Define the mathematical expression for a normalized 1s Slater-type orbital (STO), $\\phi_{1s}$, which is a function of the radial distance $r$ and an orbital exponent $\\zeta$.\n2.  Set up the required integral, $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$, in spherical coordinates. The volume element in these coordinates is $d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$.\n3.  Use the `sympy` library in Python to define all mathematical symbols and expressions. This allows for exact symbolic computation rather than numerical approximation.\n4.  Separate the full three-dimensional integral into its constituent parts: a constant factor from the wavefunctions, two angular integrals (over $\\phi$ and $\\theta$), and one radial integral (over $r$).\n5.  Calculate each of these four parts individually using `sympy`'s integration capabilities.\n6.  Display the result of each calculation, effectively showing how the final \"equation\" is built from its components, as you requested.\n7.  Finally, multiply these parts together to arrive at the simplified final answer for the integral.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef evaluate_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater orbital\n    using the sympy library.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the mathematical symbols required for the calculation.\n    # r, theta, phi are the spherical coordinates.\n    # zeta is the orbital exponent, defined as a positive real number.\n    r, theta, phi = sympy.symbols('r theta phi')\n    zeta = sympy.symbols('zeta', positive=True, real=True)\n\n    # --- Introduction and Problem Setup ---\n    print(\"This script evaluates the integral <phi_i | 1/r | phi_j> for a 1s Slater orbital.\")\n    print(\"This means we are solving for <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s>.\")\n    print(\"The normalized 1s Slater-type orbital is given by:\")\n    print(\"phi_1s(r) = (zeta**3 / pi)**(1/2) * exp(-zeta*r)\\n\")\n    print(\"The integral to solve in spherical coordinates is:\")\n    print(\"Integral[ (phi_1s)**2 * (1/r) * r**2 * sin(theta) ] dr d(theta) d(phi)\\n\")\n    print(\"This integral can be broken down into four parts: a constant part from the\")\n    print(\"wavefunction's normalization, two angular integrals, and a radial integral.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step-by-step Calculation of Each Part ---\n    print(\"--- Evaluating Each Part of the Integral ---\")\n\n    # Part 1: The constant part.
