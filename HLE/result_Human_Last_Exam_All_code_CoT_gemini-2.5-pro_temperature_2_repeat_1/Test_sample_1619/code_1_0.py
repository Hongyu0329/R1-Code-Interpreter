# Plan:
# 1. Define two numbers for the calculation.
# 2. Calculate their sum.
# 3. Print the full equation, demonstrating the consistent, verifiable result
#    expected in an objective reality. This serves as the baseline against
#    which the 'other' reality can be tested.

num1 = 2
num2 = 2
result = num1 + num2

print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
