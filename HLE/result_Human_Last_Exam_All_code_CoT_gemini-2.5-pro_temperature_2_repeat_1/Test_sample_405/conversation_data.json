    "The task is to determine the number of distinct colors found in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will research the common allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  I will identify the color of each of these allotropes.\n3.  I will list these distinct colors.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that enumerates these colors, prints them in an equation format as requested, and outputs the total count. The main allotropes are white, red, violet, and black phosphorus. Notably, white phosphorus is often referred to as yellow phosphorus due to impurities or degradation, so both \"white\" and \"yellow\" should be counted as distinct observable colors.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common allotropes of phosphorus and their colors:\n    # 1.

Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's phosphorus): Appears violet or purple.\n    # 4.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
