    # --- Part 1: Answers to Yes/No questions ---
    
    # Questions 1-4: It is a long-standing open problem whether a(n) can be infinite for d>=2.
    # Since it is not proven, the answer to "Is it true?" is No.
    ans1 = "No"  # 3D
    ans2 = "No"  # 4D
    ans3 = "No"  # 5D
    ans4 = "No"  # 6D

    # Question 5: For d>=2, it's not known if a(n) is finite, so no linear bound is proven.
    ans5 = "No"

    # Questions 6, 7, 9: These refer to a proven lower bound from a known construction.
    # The inequality a(n) >= (2^d+1)(n-1)+1 holds for d>=2.
    ans6 = "Yes" # d=3: (2^3+1)(n-1)+1 = 9n-8
    ans7 = "Yes" # d=4: (2^4+1)(n-1)+1 = 17n-16
    ans9 = "Yes" # The general formula for d>=2

    # Question 8: This suggests an upper bound that contradicts the proven lower bound for d=5.
    # a(n) < (2^5+1)(n-1)+1 is false because a(n) is proven to be >= that value.
    ans8 = "No"

    # --- Part 2: Answers to numerical questions for the 1D case ---
