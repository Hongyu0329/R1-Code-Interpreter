# The number of energy levels that differ between the two spectra is
# determined by the difference in the dimensions of the kernels of the operators L and L^+.
# All energy levels E != -alpha are shared, so we only need to consider the level E = -alpha.
#
# Let n_0 be the number of states for H_0 at E = -alpha, and n_1 for H_1.
# n_0 = dim(ker(L))
# n_1 = dim(ker(L^+))
#
# Since L and L^+ are first-order differential operators, their kernels can have a dimension of at most 1.
dim_ker_L_max = 1
dim_ker_Lplus_min = 0

# The maximum number of differing levels occurs when one partner has a zero-mode
# state and the other does not.
max_differing_levels = dim_ker_L_max - dim_ker_Lplus_min

# We print the final result based on this reasoning.
# The question is about the number of *levels* (unique energy values), not states (counting degeneracy).
# The analysis shows that only one energy level, E = -alpha, can possibly be unshared.
