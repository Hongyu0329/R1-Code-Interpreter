    "To solve this problem, we need to find the properties of a right triangle with rational sides and a given area.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Set up the equations.** Let the sides of the right triangle be $a, b$ (legs) and $c$ (hypotenuse). Since the sides are rational, we can write them as fractions. The area is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2}ab$. The Pythagorean theorem states $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n2.  **Use the standard parameterization for rational right triangles.** Any such triangle can have its sides represented by a primitive Pythagorean triple $(m^2-n^2, 2mn, m^2+n^2)$, scaled by a rational factor $r$. Let $r=k/D$, where $k$ and $D$ are integers.\n    The sides are $a = \\frac{k(m^2-n^2)}{D}$, $b = \\frac{k(2mn)}{D}$, and $c = \\frac{k(m^2+n^2)}{D}$.\n    Here, $m$ and $n$ are coprime integers of opposite parity with $m > n$.\n3.  **Relate the area to the parameters.**\n    The area is $A = \\frac{1}{2}ab = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{k(m^2-n^2)}{D}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k(2mn)}{D}\\right) = \\frac{k^2 mn(m^2-n^2)}{D^2}$.\n4.  **Incorporate the given area.**\n    We are given $A=263$. So, $\\frac{k^2 mn(m^2-n^2)}{D^2} = 263$.\n    Rearranging this gives $k^2 mn(m-n)(m+n) = 263 D^2$.\n5.  **Analyze the equation.**\n    Since $k, m, n, D$ are integers and 263 is a prime number, this equation imposes strong constraints on $m$ and $n$. To make the left side equal to the right side, the product $mn(m-n)(m+n)$ must contain a factor of 263. To minimize the denominator of the hypotenuse, we should look for the simplest solution. We can absorb square factors into $D^2$ or $k^2$. Let's set $k=1$. We need the square-free part of the integer $mn(m-n)(m+n)$ to be 263.\n    This means we are looking for integers $m$ and $n$ (coprime, opposite parity) such that `square_free_part(m*n*(m-n)*(m+n)) = 263`. If this condition holds, let's say $mn(m-n)(m+n) = 263 \\cdot S^2$ for some integer $S$.\n    Then, from $mn(m-n)(m+n) = 263 D^2$, we have $263 S^2 = 263 D^2$, which implies $D=S$.\n6.  **Find the hypotenuse and its denominator.**\n    The hypotenuse is $c = \\frac{m^2+n^2}{D}$. The denominator of this fraction is $D / \\gcd(m^2+n^2, D)$. We are looking for the smallest possible value for this denominator.\n7.  **Write a script to search for the solution.**\n    We will write a Python script to search for pairs of integers $(m, n)$ that satisfy the conditions. For each valid pair found, we will calculate the resulting denominator of the hypotenuse and find the smallest one.\n\nThe following Python code implements this search.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_square_free_part(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the square-free part of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n < 0:\n        n = -n\n        \n    i = 2\n    res = 1\n    while i * i <= n:\n        count = 0\n        while n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            n //= i\n        if count % 2 == 1:\n            res *= i\n        i += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        res *= n\n    return res\n\ndef find_smallest_denominator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse\n    of a right triangle with area 263.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_denominator = float('inf')\n\n    # We are looking for integers m, n (m>n>0, gcd(m,n)=1, m,n opposite parity)\n    # such that the square-free part of N = m*n*(m^2-n^2) is 263.\n    # We can then set D = sqrt(N / 263).\n    # The hypotenuse is c = (m^2+n^2)/D.
