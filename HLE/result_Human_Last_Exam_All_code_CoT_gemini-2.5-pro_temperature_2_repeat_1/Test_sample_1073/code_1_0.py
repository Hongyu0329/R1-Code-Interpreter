# Part 1: Calculate the value of K from the Jones polynomial

# The Jones polynomial for the figure-eight knot (4₁) is V(t) = t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1 - t + t².
# K is the value of this polynomial evaluated at t = -1.
t = -1

# We calculate each term to construct the final equation.
# V(t) = (t⁻²) - (t⁻¹) + (1) - (t) + (t²)
term1 = t**-2
term2_val = t**-1
term3 = 1
term4_val = t
term5 = t**2

# Calculate the final value of K
K = term1 - term2_val + term3 - term4_val + term5
