    print("Analyzing the problem:")
    print("The question asks for the spectral expansion technique used for 'poloidal dependence' in 'toroidal systems'.\n")

    print("Step 1: Understand the geometry.")
    print("A toroidal system is shaped like a donut. The 'poloidal' direction is the angle as you go the short way around the donut's cross-section.")
    print("The key physical characteristic of this poloidal angle (often denoted by theta, Î¸) is that it is periodic. A full circle from 0 to 2*pi returns to the same point.\n")
    
    print("Step 2: Identify the best mathematical tool for periodic functions.")
    print("A Fourier series is a mathematical tool that represents a periodic function as a sum of sine and cosine functions. This makes it the most natural and widely adapted method for representing quantities that vary periodically, like the poloidal dependence.\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluate other options.")
    print("Polynomial expansions (Legendre, Chebyshev, etc.) are typically used for non-periodic functions on finite intervals. Spherical Harmonics are used for functions on the surface of a sphere, not a torus.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The technique perfectly suited for a periodic coordinate like the poloidal angle is the Fourier series.\n")

# This task is a multiple-choice question, so there is no equation to output numbers from.
# The code above provides the reasoning. The final answer choice is D.
