def solve_hopf_algebra_questions():
    """
    Solves the theoretical questions based on the derivation.
    The derivation leads to the following conclusions:
    - The action of x is given by left multiplication with w: x . r = w * r.
    - The action of x^d is given by left multiplication with w^d: x^d . r = w^d * r.

    Based on this:
    (a) The condition for x^d * a . r = 0 is w^d * (a . r) = 0.
        For this to hold for arbitrary a and r, we must have w^d = 0.
        Let's represent the condition as an equation: w**d = 0.
    (b) The expression for x^d . r is w^d * r.
    (c) Can x^j * a . r be zero for j >= M?
        The expression is w^j * (a . r). This can be zero if, for example, w is nilpotent (w^N=0 for some N).
        If we choose j >= N, the expression is zero. Nothing in the problem prevents w from being nilpotent.
        So, the answer is yes.
