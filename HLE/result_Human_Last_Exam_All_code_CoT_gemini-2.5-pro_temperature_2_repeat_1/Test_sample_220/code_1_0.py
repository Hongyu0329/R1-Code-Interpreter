    Calculates the jet speed from bursting bubbles of two different sizes using a scaling law.

    The jet velocity (V) from a bursting bubble is described by the scaling law:
    V = K * sqrt(sigma / (rho * R)), where K is a constant of proportionality.
    This script determines K using a plausible value for the first bubble and then calculates
    the speed for the second bubble.
