  Solves the three-part question about dessin d'enfants.

  # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
  # G is quasiprimitive on the face set F, so its socle N is transitive on F.
  # The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are the orbits of N on F.
  # Since N is transitive on F, there is only one orbit.
  # Therefore, D_N has one face, meaning it is unicellular.
  # The condition that G/N is cyclic is not required for this conclusion.
  answer_a = "Yes"

  # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the
  # automorphism group of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
  # A smooth covering implies that <g_infinity> intersects N trivially.
  # This is possible for groups of type HA and AS.
  # It is impossible for groups of type TW (product action type).
  answer_b = "HA, AS"

  # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5,
  # D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
  # The impossibility of a smooth covering for TW type groups is a general result
  # that does not depend on the parameter l.
  # Therefore, the statement is true.
  answer_c = "True"

  # Format the final answer as specified.
