import sympy

# Define the variable x
x = sympy.Symbol('x')

# Define the polynomial from the curve equation
# y^2 = x^6 + 2*x^3 + 4*x^2 + 4*x + 1
f = x**6 + 2*x**3 + 4*x**2 + 4*x + 1

# Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial
disc = sympy.discriminant(f)

# The prime factorization of the discriminant can give hints about minimality.
# A small power for each prime factor suggests the model might be minimal.
# disc_factors = sympy.factorint(disc)

# The question asks for the minimal discriminant. Based on the analysis in the thinking steps,
# the given model is likely minimal. Thus, its discriminant is the answer.
