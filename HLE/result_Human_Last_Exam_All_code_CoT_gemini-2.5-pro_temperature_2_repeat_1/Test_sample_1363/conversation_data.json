    "Of the dances listed, the European Tango has a unique technique that makes overturning a reverse turn impossible without fundamentally altering the character and principles of the dance. In the other swing-based dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), overturning is technically possible through the use of CBM, sway, and foot swivel, even if it is considered poor form.\n\nThe Tango Reverse Turn, particularly the \"Open Reverse Turn, Lady Outside\" portion, involves specific foot placements without the use of CBM on step 2, and a staccato action where feet are picked up and placed, not swiveled. Attempting to add more rotation (overturn) would require introducing CBM or swiveling on the supporting foot, which is a direct violation of its core technique.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically find the correct answer based on these technical attributes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the technical characteristics of several ballroom dances\n    to determine in which one it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn\n    without disregarding the technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    dance_techniques = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Viennese Waltz',\n            'overturn_possible': True,\n            'reason': 'Uses swing and continuous rotation, allowing for adjustment in turn amount.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'English Waltz',\n            'overturn_possible': True,\n            'reason': 'Relies on CBM and foot swivel, which can be exaggerated to create more turn.'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'European Tango',\n            'overturn_possible': False,\n            'reason': 'The technique for a Reverse Turn specifically omits CBM and foot swivel on key steps.
