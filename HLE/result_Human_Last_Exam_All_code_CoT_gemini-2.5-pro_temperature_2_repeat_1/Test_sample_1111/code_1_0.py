k = 3
# The final answer is an integer. We will print the logic and the final answer.
# This problem does not lend itself to a simple numerical calculation in code without extensive simulation
# or implementation of advanced probability theorems. The solution is based on established theoretical results.
# The key insight is that the system's behavior changes with k, corresponding to changes
# in the dimensionality of the random walk of particle position differences.
# k=3 corresponds to a 2D difference-walk, which is the highest dimension that is still recurrent.
