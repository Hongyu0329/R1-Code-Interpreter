    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function followed by a Python script to present the final results.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Define the Partition Function:** The grand canonical partition function is defined as `Z = Tr[e^(-β(H_system - μ_chem*N))]`, where `H_system` is the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian, `μ_chem` is the chemical potential, and `N` is the particle number operator. The user provides a total Hamiltonian `H = -μN`, which appears in the exponent. Thus, we are asked to calculate `Z = Tr[e^(-βH)] = Tr[e^(βμN)]`. This is equivalent to a grand canonical system with no intrinsic dynamics (`H_system = 0`) and a chemical potential `μ_chem = μ`.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Path Integral:** The trace `Tr` can be expressed as a functional path integral over fields `ψ(τ)` that are functions of imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β`.\n    `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n    The boundary conditions on the fields depend on the particle statistics: periodic for bosons (`ψ(β) = ψ(0)`) and anti-periodic for fermions (`ψ(β) = -ψ(0)`).\n\n3.  **Define the Action (S):** For a general system of non-interacting particles, the Euclidean action `S` is given by:\n    `S = Σ_i ∫_0^β dτ ψ_i*(τ) [∂_τ + ε_i - μ_chem] ψ_i(τ)`\n    Here, `i` indexes the single-particle quantum states with energies `ε_i`. Based on our interpretation from Step 1, we set the particle energies `ε_i = 0` for all states and the chemical potential `μ_chem = μ`. Assuming there are `g` such degenerate single-particle states, the action for our system becomes:\n    `S = Σ_{i=1}^g ∫_0^β dτ ψ_i*(τ) [∂_τ - μ] ψ_i(τ)`\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Path Integral:** This expression for the action leads to a standard Gaussian path integral. The result of the integration is well-known and depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions.\n    *   For a **fermionic system** (using Grassmann fields), the result is `Z_fermions = Π_i (1 + e^(-β(ε_i - μ)))`.\n    *   For a **bosonic system** (using complex fields), the result is `Z_bosons = Π_i (1 - e^(-β(ε_i - μ)))^-1`.\n\n5.  **Obtain the Final Expressions:** We now substitute our system's specific parameters (`ε_i = 0` and `g` degenerate states) into these general results.\n\n    *   **Fermions:**\n        `Z_f = (1 + e^(-β(0 - μ)))^g = (1 + e^(βμ))^g`\n\n    *   **Bosons:**\n        `Z_b = (1 - e^(-β(0 - μ)))^(-g) = (1 - e^(βμ))^(-g)`\n        Note: For the bosonic case, the geometric series underlying the derivation only converges if `e^(βμ) < 1`, which implies `μ < 0` since `β` is positive.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to elegantly display these final mathematical formulas.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbols to be used in the equations\nbeta, mu, g = sp.symbols('β μ g', real=True)\n# Assume beta (inverse temperature) and g (degeneracy) are positive\n# beta is 1/(k_B T) and must be positive.\n# g is a count of states and must be positive.\n\n# Introduction explaining the setup\nprint(\"This script calculates the partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H = -μN.\")\nprint(\"The calculation is based on the path integral formalism in the grand canonical ensemble.\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to a system with zero single-particle energy and chemical potential μ.\")\nprint(\"The result depends on the statistics of the constituent particles (bosons or fermions).\")\nprint(\"Let 'g' be the number of degenerate single-particle states.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"=\"*60)\n# --- Fermionic Case ---\nprint(\"Case 1: The system consists of FERMIONS\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n# Define the expression for the fermionic partition function\n# The formula is Z = (1 + exp(βμ))^g\nZ_fermions_expr = (1 + sp.exp(beta * mu))**g\nprint(\"The path integral for fermions evaluates to the following partition function Z_fermions:\")\n# The sp.pretty() function prints the expression in a formatted, readable way\nprint(sp.pretty(Z_fermions_expr, use_unicode=True))\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n\nprint(\"=\"*60)\n# --- Bosonic Case ---\nprint(\"Case 2: The system consists of BOSONS\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n# Define the expression for the bosonic partition function\n# The formula is Z = (1 - exp(βμ))^(-g)\nZ_bosons_expr = (1 - sp.exp(beta * mu))**(-g)\nprint(\"The path integral for bosons evaluates to the following partition function Z_bosons:\")\nprint(sp.pretty(Z_bosons_expr, use_unicode=True))\nprint(\"\\nThis result is valid for μ < 0 to ensure convergence.\")\nprint(\"=\"*60)\n\n```\n<<<For fermions, Z = (1 + exp(βμ))^g.
