# Let S = SNYWR. In this script, we'll use a placeholder value for S.

# the result of a previous problem. Let's assume S = 100 for this example.

# In triangle ABC, we are given BC = S and mâˆ B = 30 degrees.
# We need to find the number of integer values for side AC
# for which there are two possible lengths for side AB.

# This is the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines (SSA). Two solutions exist if
# BC * sin(B) < AC < BC.
#
# Let's calculate the bounds:
# sin(30 degrees) = 0.5
lower_bound = S * 0.5
upper_bound = S

# We need to find the number of integers strictly between lower_bound and upper_bound.
# For AC, the condition is: S/2 < AC < S

# The smallest possible integer for AC is floor(S/2) + 1.
# For integer S, this is equivalent to (S // 2) + 1.
smallest_integer_AC = (S // 2) + 1

# The largest possible integer for AC is S - 1.
largest_integer_AC = S - 1

# The total number of integer values is (largest - smallest + 1).
count = largest_integer_AC - smallest_integer_AC + 1
