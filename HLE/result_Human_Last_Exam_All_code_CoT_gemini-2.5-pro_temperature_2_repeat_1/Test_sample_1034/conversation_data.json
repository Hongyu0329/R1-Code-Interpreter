    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Plan**\n\n1.  **Understand the Geometry:** The problem describes a triangle ABC with side `BC`, side `AC`, and the angle `∠B` given. This is known as the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case in trigonometry. The SSA case is ambiguous because it can result in zero, one, or two possible triangles, depending on the lengths of the sides.\n\n2.  **Condition for Two Triangles:** For there to be two possible values for the third side (`AB`), the length of the side opposite the given angle (`AC`) must satisfy a specific condition. Let `a = BC = S`, `b = AC`, and `c = AB`. We are given `a` and `∠B`.\n    Two distinct triangles exist if and only if the side `b` is longer than the altitude `h` from vertex C to the line containing side AB, but shorter than the side `a`.\n    \n3.  **Calculate the Altitude:** The altitude `h` can be calculated using the sine of the given angle:\n    `h = a * sin(B)`\n    Given `a = S` and `m∠B = 30°`, and knowing that `sin(30°) = 0.5`, the altitude is:\n    `h = S * 0.5 = S / 2`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Inequality:** The condition for two triangles is `h < b < a`. Substituting our values, we get:\n    `S / 2 < AC < S`\n\n5.  **Count the Integers:** The problem asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC`. So, we need to count the number of integers strictly between `S/2` and `S`.\n    *   The smallest integer value for `AC` will be `floor(S/2) + 1`. In Python, for a positive integer `S`, this is `(S // 2) + 1`.\n    *   The largest integer value for `AC` will be `S - 1` (assuming S is an integer, which is standard in such problems).\n    *   The total count is `(Largest Integer) - (Smallest Integer) + 1`.\n    \n6.  **Set up the Code:** The term `SNYWR` stands for \"Substitute Number You Will Receive,\" which is common in team-based math competitions. Since no number is provided, I will use a placeholder value of `S = 100` to demonstrate the solution. The code will calculate the result based on this value. The final print statement will show the equation used to get the count, as requested.\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Let S = SNYWR. In this script, we'll use a placeholder value for S.\n# As per the problem's format (SNYWR), this value would typically be\n# the result of a previous problem. Let's assume S = 100 for this example.\nS = 100\n\n# In triangle ABC, we are given BC = S and m∠B = 30 degrees.\n# We need to find the number of integer values for side AC\n# for which there are two possible lengths for side AB.\n\n# This is the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines (SSA). Two solutions exist if\n# BC * sin(B) < AC < BC.\n#\n# Let's calculate the bounds:\n# sin(30 degrees) = 0.5\nlower_bound = S * 0.5\nupper_bound = S\n\n# We need to find the number of integers strictly between lower_bound and upper_bound.\n# For AC, the condition is: S/2 < AC < S\n\n# The smallest possible integer for AC is floor(S/2) + 1.\n# For integer S, this is equivalent to (S // 2) + 1.\nsmallest_integer_AC = (S // 2) + 1\n\n# The largest possible integer for AC is S - 1.\nlargest_integer_AC = S - 1\n\n# The total number of integer values is (largest - smallest + 1).\ncount = largest_integer_AC - smallest_integer_AC + 1\n\nprint(f\"Given S = {S}, the condition for two possible triangles is {lower_bound} < AC < {upper_bound}.\")\nprint(f\"The range of possible integer values for AC is from {smallest_integer_AC} to {largest_integer_AC}.\")\nprint(\"The final equation for the count is:\")\nprint(f\"{largest_integer_AC} - {smallest_integer_AC} + 1 = {count}\")\n```\n<<<49>>>"
