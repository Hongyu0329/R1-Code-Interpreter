        'A. Stock market level of the S&P500': 'This was a consequence, not a cause. The collapse in RMBS values contributed to the stock market crash.',
        'B. The percent of floating rate debt in the pool': 'A significant accelerating factor, as interest rate resets triggered defaults, but not the ultimate root cause of why the loans were bad in the first place.',
        'C. Average FICO scores on the loans': 'A key indicator of poor underwriting, but it is just one component of the overall degradation in loan quality.',
        'D. The 10 year US Treasury rate': 'This is a benchmark risk-free rate. The main driver of value collapse was the explosion in the *credit spread* over treasuries, which was a reaction to perceived risk from other factors.',
        'E. Default rates': 'This is the direct mechanism that destroyed RMBS value. However, it is the *symptom* or *outcome* of the root cause, not the root cause itself. The question is *why* the defaults happened.',
        'F. The quality of the loan issuer and RMBS originator': 'This is the most accurate root cause. It encompasses the systemic breakdown in underwriting standards, the proliferation of risky products (e.g., "liar loans," NINJA loans), and the originate-to-distribute model which incentivized volume over quality. Poor origination is the source of the bad assets.',
        'G. Recovery rates': 'Critically important for determining the *magnitude* of the loss after a default. Plunging home prices crushed recovery rates. However, the initial event was still the default, which stemmed from poor origination.',
        'H. The rating of the credit agency on issuance': 'This was a massive failure of oversight and an *enabling factor*. Incorrectly high ratings allowed the market for low-quality RMBS to exist and grow, but the credit agencies did not create the underlying bad loans.'
