    print("A key result from set theory (due to Shelah) is that any such tower must have a length strictly greater than ω_1.")

    print("The successor of a regular cardinal is regular, so ω_2 is a regular cardinal.")

    print("From Step 1 and Step 2, we have concluded that for any λ in X, ω_2 ≤ λ ≤ ω_2.")
