# The problem requires finding the value of the capacitor x such that the
# equivalent capacitance of the ladder circuit is independent of the number of cells, N.
# This condition is met when the ladder is terminated by its characteristic
# capacitance. Therefore, the value of x must be equal to this characteristic capacitance.

# Let Y be the characteristic capacitance. Y is the "fixed point" of the capacitance
# recurrence relation. If a ladder with capacitance Y is loaded onto one cell, the
# new input capacitance is still Y.

# A single cell is loaded with a capacitance C_out. This C_out is in parallel with the
# cell's shunt capacitor c. This combination, C_p = c + C_out, is connected
# between the output nodes of the two series capacitors c.

# Through nodal analysis of one cell, we can derive the recurrence relation:
# C_in = c * (c + C_out) / (3*c + 2*C_out)

# To find the characteristic capacitance Y, we set C_in = C_out = Y:
# Y = c * (c + Y) / (3*c + 2*Y)
# Rearranging this gives a quadratic equation for Y:
# Y * (3*c + 2*Y) = c*c + c*Y
# 3*c*Y + 2*Y^2 = c^2 + c*Y
# 2*Y^2 + 2*c*Y - c^2 = 0

# We solve this quadratic equation for Y. We can divide by c^2 to solve for the
# ratio y = Y/c, which gives 2*y^2 + 2*y - 1 = 0.
# The solutions for ay^2 + by + d = 0 are y = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ad)) / 2a.
# Here, a=2, b=2, d=-1.
# y = (-2 +/- sqrt(2^2 - 4*2*(-1))) / (2*2)
# y = (-2 +/- sqrt(4 + 8)) / 4
# y = (-2 +/- sqrt(12)) / 4
# y = (-2 +/- 2*sqrt(3)) / 4
# y = (-1 +/- sqrt(3)) / 2
# Since capacitance must be positive, we take the positive root.
# y = (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2
# Therefore, Y = c * (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2.
# The capacitor x must have this value.
