    "My plan to solve this problem is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix A. The information regarding the Markov quiver and `m_1/2 = 13` is contextual; the core task is the determinant calculation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation, which will be implemented in the Python script:\n1.  Define the 3x3 matrix `A` as provided.\n2.  Use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n    `det([[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n3.  The script will substitute the values from matrix `A` into this formula and print the expression, showing each number involved.\n4.  It will then calculate the intermediate results (the values of the 2x2 sub-determinants).\n5.  Finally, it will compute the sum of these terms to find the final value of the determinant and print it.\n\nThis approach will clearly show all the numbers and steps involved in the final equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem asks for the determinant of the matrix A.\n# The information \"Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13\" is context for where this matrix arises,\n# but it is not needed for the computation itself.\n\n# The given matrix is:\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# For a 3x3 matrix [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]], the determinant is calculated as:\n# det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\n# Let's extract the elements from matrix A to use in the formula.\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\nprint(f\"The given matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nWe calculate the determinant using the formula: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\n# Step 1: Substitute the numbers from matrix A into the formula.\n# Note that the formula has a '-b' term, which becomes '-(-1)' = '+1'.\nprint(\"\\nStep 1: Substituting the numbers into the formula gives:\")\nprint(f\"Determinant = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the values inside each parenthesis (the cofactors).\nval1 = e * i - f * h\nval2 = d * i - f * g\nval3 = d * h - e * g\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Evaluating the expressions inside the parentheses:\")\nprint(f\"({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h}) = {4 - 1} = {val1}\")\nprint(f\"({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g}) = {-2 - 1} = {val2}\")\nprint(f\"({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}) = {1 - (-2)} = {val3}\")\n\n# Step 3: Substitute these values back into the equation.\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: The equation becomes:\")\n# To correctly show the sign for the 'b' term, we calculate -b\nterm_b_sign = -b\n# Display it nicely with a plus sign if positive\nsign = '+' if term_b_sign > 0 else ''\nprint(f\"Determinant = ({a})*({val1}) {sign} ({term_b_sign})*({val2}) + ({c})*({val3})\")\n\n# Step 4: Perform the final multiplications and sum.\nfinal_result = a * val1 - b * val2 + c * val3\nprint(\"\\nStep 4: Performing the final calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Determinant = {a * val1} + {term_b_sign * val2} + {c * val3}\")\nprint(f\"Determinant = {6} - {3} - {3} = {final_result}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n-------------------------------------------\")\nprint(f\"The determinant of the adjacency matrix is: {final_result}\")\nprint(\"-------------------------------------------\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
