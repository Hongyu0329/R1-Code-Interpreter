# Step 1: Mixing Barium Chloride and Silver Nitrate
print("Step 1: The initial reaction between BaCl₂ and AgNO₃.")
print("When aqueous solutions of barium chloride (BaCl₂) and silver nitrate (AgNO₃) are mixed, a double displacement reaction occurs.")
print("The ions exchange partners: Ba²⁺ with NO₃⁻ and Ag⁺ with Cl⁻.")
print("The resulting products are Barium Nitrate (Ba(NO₃)₂) and Silver Chloride (AgCl).")
print("\nUsing solubility rules:")
print("- Most nitrate salts are soluble, so Barium Nitrate (Ba(NO₃)₂) remains dissolved in the water.")
print("- Silver Chloride (AgCl) is insoluble in water, so it forms a solid precipitate.")
print("\nThe balanced chemical equation is:")
print("Reactants: 1 molecule of BaCl₂ and 2 molecules of AgNO₃")
print("Products:  1 molecule of Ba(NO₃)₂ and 2 molecules of AgCl")
print("\nBaCl₂(aq) + 2 AgNO₃(aq) -> Ba(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2 AgCl(s)\n")
# After this step, the barium is in the form of Barium Nitrate.

# Step 2: Adding and Removing Ammonia
print("Step 2: The effect of adding and removing ammonia (NH₃).")
print("Ammonia is added. While barium nitrate does not react with ammonia, silver chloride (AgCl) does.")
print("AgCl dissolves in ammonia to form a soluble complex ion, [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺.")
print("The reaction is: AgCl(s) + 2NH₃(aq) -> [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)")
print("\nThen, the ammonia is evaporated. This process is reversible.")
print("As ammonia is removed, the equilibrium shifts back, and the silver chloride (AgCl) re-precipitates.")
print("This series of steps only temporarily dissolves and then re-forms the AgCl precipitate. It does not chemically change the barium nitrate.")

# Conclusion
print("Conclusion:")
print("The various drying and mixing steps do not alter the outcome of the initial precipitation reaction.")
print("The barium-containing compound formed in the first step remains in the flask.")
print("\nThe final barium salt in the flask is Barium Nitrate.")
print("Its chemical formula is Ba(NO₃)₂.")
