    The question asks which factor dominates to maintain a constant genomic mutation rate when mutation pressure is the primary driver. Let's analyze the options:

    A. Natural selection for fitness optimality: Selection acts on the consequences of mutations, not on the rate at which they occur.
    B. Genetic drift in small populations: Drift affects the frequency of existing mutations, not their initial rate of creation.
    C. Equilibrium between beneficial and deleterious mutations: The mutation rate is an input parameter for this equilibrium, not something maintained by it.
    D. Homogeneous mutation distribution across genomic sites: This describes the spatial pattern of mutations, not the overall rate.

    E. The stochastic nature of mutational events: This is the correct answer. Mutations are random, probabilistic chemical events (e.g., DNA replication errors). The genome is vast, providing billions of opportunities for these events to occur during each replication cycle. According to the law of large numbers, the cumulative result of many independent random events leads to a highly predictable average rate. Therefore, the stochastic nature of the molecular processes themselves is what maintains an approximately constant overall mutation rate for a given species under stable conditions.
