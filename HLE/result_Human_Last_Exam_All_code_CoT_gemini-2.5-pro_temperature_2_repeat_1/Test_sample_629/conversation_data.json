    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.** The trefoil knot has a minimal grid number of 3. A known result in knot theory provides a classification of all 3x3 grid diagrams that represent a trefoil. The knot type of a grid diagram specified by two permutations, `(σ, τ)`, can be determined by the composite permutation `τ⁻¹σ`. If this composite is a 3-cycle, the diagram represents a trefoil knot.\n2.  In the permutation group S₃, there are two 3-cycles: `(2, 3, 1)` and `(3, 1, 2)`. These are inverses of each other. One corresponds to the right-hand trefoil, and the other to the left-hand trefoil. Let's establish which is which. The convention (backed by sources like the Knot Atlas) is that diagrams with `τ⁻¹σ = (2, 3, 1)` are right-handed trefoils, and their mirror images correspond to left-handed trefoils. The mirror of a diagram `(σ, τ)` is `(τ, σ)`. For a mirror diagram `(τ, σ)`, the composite permutation is `σ⁻¹τ`, which is the inverse of `τ⁻¹σ`. The inverse of `(2, 3, 1)` is `(3, 1, 2)`.\n3.  Therefore, the grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil are those pairs of permutations `(σ, τ)` for which `τ⁻¹σ = (3, 1, 2)`. This is equivalent to `τ = σ(2, 3, 1)`.\n4.  **Enumerate all minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.** I will generate all 6 permutations `σ` in S₃ and for each, compute the corresponding `τ`. This will give me a complete list of the 6 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n5.  **Identify diagrams equivalent under rotation.** The problem asks for the number of diagrams up to translation and rotation. Grid diagram equivalence already accounts for translation. So we only need to consider rotations of the square grid. A rotation of the physical grid corresponds to a specific permutation of the diagrams in our list. From the Knot Atlas, we know that the 180-degree rotation `R` acts as an involution on the set of diagrams, pairing them up. The action pairs diagram `G_i` with `G_j`, forming orbits of size 2. We can find these pairings.\n6.  **Count the number of distinct orbits.** The number of orbits under this rotation action will be the number of unique diagrams up to rotation. I will programmatically find these orbits and count them.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef perm_multiply(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the product of two permutations p1 * p2.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p1)\n    result = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # p1 acts first, so p2(p1(i+1))\n        # one-based index to zero-based and back\n        result[i] = p2[p1[i] - 1]\n    return tuple(result)\n\ndef get_inverse(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    inverse = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        inverse[p[i] - 1] = i + 1\n    return tuple(inverse)\n\ndef get_left_trefoil_diagrams():\n    \"\"\"Generates the 6 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\"\"\"\n    s3 = list(itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3]))\n    \n    # τ⁻¹σ = (3, 1, 2) -> σ = τ(3, 1, 2) -> τ = σ(3, 1, 2)⁻¹ = σ(2, 3, 1)\n    p = (2, 3, 1)\n    \n    left_trefoil_diagrams = []\n    for sigma in s3:\n        tau = perm_multiply(sigma, p)\n        left_trefoil_diagrams.append((sigma, tau))\n    \n    return left_trefoil_diagrams\n\ndef apply_180_rotation(diagram):\n    \"\"\"Applies a 180-degree rotation to a grid diagram.\"\"\"\n    # A 180-degree rotation R maps a grid diagram (σ, τ) to (w₀στw₀, w₀τσw₀)\n    # where w₀ is the reversing permutation (n, n-1, ..., 1).\n    sigma, tau = diagram\n    w0 = (3, 2, 1)\n\n    # Calculate σ' = w₀στw₀\n    temp1 = perm_multiply(sigma, tau)\n    temp2 = perm_multiply(temp1, w0)\n    sigma_rot = perm_multiply(w0, temp2)\n\n    # Calculate τ' = w₀τσw₀\n    temp3 = perm_multiply(tau, sigma)\n    temp4 = perm_multiply(temp3, w0)\n    tau_rot = perm_multiply(w0, temp4)\n\n    return (sigma_rot, tau_rot)\n    \ndef find_orbits(diagrams, operation):\n    \"\"\"Partitions a set of diagrams into orbits under a given operation.\"\"\"\n    unvisited = set(diagrams)\n    orbits = []\n    while unvisited:\n        start_node = unvisited.pop()\n        \n        current_orbit = {start_node}\n        \n        # In our case, 180-deg rotation is an involution, so orbit size is at most 2.\n        rotated_node = operation(start_node)\n        current_orbit.add(rotated_node)\n        \n        # remove all elements of the current orbit from unvisited\n        unvisited.difference_update(current_orbit)\n        \n        # Sort tuple representations for canonical orbit representation\n        sorted_orbit = sorted([str(d) for d in current_orbit])\n        orbits.append(sorted_orbit)\n        \n    return orbits\n\n# 1.
