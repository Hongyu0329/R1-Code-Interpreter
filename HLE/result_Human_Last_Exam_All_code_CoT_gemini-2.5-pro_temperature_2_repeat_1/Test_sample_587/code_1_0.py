    A. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable for every class H.

    This statement is FALSE. The classic counterexample is when H is the class of all cliques. The problem of counting k-cliques is known to be #W[1]-complete, the canonical hard problem for the class #W[1]. It is not considered fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), unless FPT = #W[1].

    B. If H is the class of all cliques, then #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.

    This is plausible but might be too strong. The problem is indeed #W[1]-hard on 'sufficiently rich' graph classes G, and 'somewhere dense' implies this richness. However, #W[1]-completeness requires that every problem in #W[1] can be reduced to counting cliques on a graph from G. This might not hold for *every* possible 'somewhere dense' class G, as a specific class G might not contain the graphs needed for all such reductions. So, while hard, 'complete' is not guaranteed for every G. This makes the statement suspect.

    C. There exists a class H of graphs of degree at most 2 such that #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.

    This statement is FALSE. A graph of maximum degree at most 2 is a collection of disjoint paths and cycles. Any such graph has a treewidth of at most 2. A class of graphs with bounded treewidth is known to lead to an FPT algorithm for subgraph counting. An FPT problem cannot be #W[1]-complete unless FPT = #W[1].

    D. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded treewidth.

    This statement is TRUE. It represents a major dichotomy theorem in parameterized complexity.
    - (if): If H has bounded treewidth, the problem is FPT. This is a known result, and algorithms exist.
    - (only if): If the problem is FPT, then H must have bounded treewidth. The contrapositive is: if H has unbounded treewidth, the problem is not FPT. This has been proven by showing the problem becomes #W[1]-hard in this case. This is considered a cornerstone result in the field.

    E. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded vertex-cover number.

    This statement is FALSE. While 'bounded vertex cover' implies 'bounded treewidth' (making the 'if' direction true), the 'only if' direction fails. Let H be the class of all paths. Paths have treewidth 1, so the problem is FPT. However, paths have unbounded vertex-cover number. This provides a counterexample.
