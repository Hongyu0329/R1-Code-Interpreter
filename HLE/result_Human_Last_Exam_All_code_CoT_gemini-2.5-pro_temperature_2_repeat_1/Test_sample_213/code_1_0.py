# The problem asks to identify a single line of code that had one character removed.
# My analysis points to the definition of the rotation matrix `Rz` inside the `rotate` function.
# The standard matrix for rotation around the Z-axis requires a negative sine term in the second column.
# The provided code is missing this minus sign, which constitutes a single-character bug.

# The buggy line in the shader:
# mat3 Rz=mat3(vec3(cos(a.z),sin(a.z),0),vec3(sin(a.z),cos(a.z),0),vec3(0,0,1));

# The original, correct line with the character restored:
correct_line = "mat3 Rz=mat3(vec3(cos(a.z),sin(a.z),0),vec3(-sin(a.z),cos(a.z),0),vec3(0,0,1));"

print(correct_line)
