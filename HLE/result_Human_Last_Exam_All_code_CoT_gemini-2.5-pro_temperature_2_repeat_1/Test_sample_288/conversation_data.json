    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons, I will analyze the synaptic connectivity data from the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite connectome (Cook et al., 2019). The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Represent the Data**: I'll create a data structure in Python containing the outgoing synaptic connections from the ASJ neurons (ASJL and ASJR).\n2.  **Aggregate Synapses**: I will process this data to sum the number of synapses for each postsynaptic neuron *type* (e.g., combining counts for AVAL and AVAR into a single 'AVA' type).\n3.  **Identify the Maximum**: I will find the neuron type that receives the highest total number of synapses from ASJ.\n4.  **Display the Result**: The code will then print a clear statement identifying the main target and show the specific synaptic connections from ASJL and ASJR that contribute to this total.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes C. elegans connectome data to find the main synaptic target of ASJ axons.\n    Data is based on the adult hermaphrodite connectome from Cook et al.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
