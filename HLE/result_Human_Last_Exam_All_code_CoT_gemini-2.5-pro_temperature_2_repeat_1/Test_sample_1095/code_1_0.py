    # Step 1: Understand the premise.
    # A superposition of Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes rotates due to the Gouy phase shift,
    # which is dependent on the topological charge 'l'.
    # We want to find a condition for BG modes to exhibit a similar rotational effect.
    print("1. Rotation in light beams like 'light springs' arises from a phase difference between the superposed modes that evolves with propagation.")
    print("   For LG modes, this is due to the l-dependent Gouy phase.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the propagation phase of a BG beam.
    # The propagation phase is exp(i * k_z * z), where k_z is the longitudinal wavevector.
    # k_z is related to the radial wavevector k_r by: k_z^2 = k^2 - k_r^2
    # In the paraxial approximation (k_r << k), this is: k_z ≈ k - (k_r^2 / (2k))
    print("\n2. The propagation phase of a BG beam depends on its longitudinal wavevector, k_z.")
    print("   In the paraxial approximation, k_z can be expressed as: k_z ≈ k - (k_r^2 / (2*k))")

    # Step 3: Determine the condition for l-dependent phase evolution.
    # For a superposition of BG modes with different topological charges (l) to rotate,
    # the propagation constant k_z must depend on l.
    # Since k is constant, this dependency must come from k_r. So, k_r must be a function of l.
    print("\n3. For a superposition of BG modes with different 'l' to rotate, their relative phase must change with distance.")
    print("   This means k_z must depend on 'l'. This requires k_r to be a function of 'l', i.e., k_r = f(l).")

    # Step 4: Derive the specific functional form.
    # The rotational behavior of LG modes is due to a phase term that is (approximately) linear in 'l'.
    # To replicate this, the l-dependent part of the BG phase, which is -(k_r(l)^2 * z) / (2k), should be linear in 'l'.
    # This implies that k_r(l)^2 must be proportional to l.
    print("\n4. To mimic the LG mode rotation (where phase shift is proportional to l), the l-dependent term in the BG phase must also be proportional to l.")
    print("   The relevant term is k_r(l)^2. Therefore, we must have:")
    print("   k_r(l)^2 ∝ l")

    # Step 5: Final relationship
    # Taking the square root of both sides gives the condition for k_r.
    # The variables in the final relationship are k_r (the radial wavevector) and l (the topological charge).
    l_symbol = '\u2113' # Unicode for script 'l' to match the question
    k_r_symbol = 'k_r'
    sqrt_symbol = '\u221A' # Unicode for square root

    print(f"   - {l_symbol} is the topological charge of the beam")
    
    # Step 6: Identify the correct answer choice.
