    explanation = """
    In his book "The Disneyization of Society" (2004), sociologist Alan Bryman argues that the principles of the Disney theme parks are becoming more influential across various sectors of society. He identifies four primary characteristics, or dimensions, of this process:

    1.  **Theming:** This is the application of a narrative to an institution, location, or object. It's about creating an immersive, often idealized environment that tells a story, rather than just decorating a space.

    2.  **Hybrid Consumption:** This refers to the blurring of lines between different forms of consumption. A classic example is a restaurant that is also a gift shop and an entertainment venue, encouraging visitors to consume in multiple ways in a single location.

    3.  **Merchandising:** This is the promotion and sale of goods that are branded with copyrighted images and logos associated with the themed experience. The merchandise acts as a tangible souvenir and extends the brand's reach.

    4.  **Performative Labor:** This dimension involves requiring employees to do more than just their functional tasks; they must also "perform" a role. This includes scripted speech, specific emotional expressions, and acting as part of the overall themed narrative.

    Evaluating the answer choices against these four official dimensions:
    - A. hybrid consumption and merchandising: Both are correct dimensions identified by Bryman.
    - B. performative labor and sanitization: While Disney parks are sanitized, 'sanitization' is not one of Bryman's four main dimensions.
    - C. trivialization and theming: 'Trivialization' is a criticism of the effect of Disneyization, not one of its core dimensions.
    - D. sanitization and trivialization: Neither of these are the primary dimensions defined by Bryman.
    - E. Disneyfication and Disneyization: These are the names of the concept, not its characteristics.
    - F. McDonaldization and Disneyization: McDonaldization is a distinct, though related, sociological theory.
    - G. theming and performative labor: Both are correct dimensions identified by Bryman.

    Both choices (A) and (G) contain a pair of correct dimensions. However, 'theming' is often considered the foundational principle from which the others emerge, and 'performative labor' describes the crucial human element of the created experience. This pairing represents the construction of the environment and the interactions within it, making it an extremely strong and representative answer.
