print("--- Analyzing the Space and its Components ---")

# Step 1: Define the original space X.
# X is the union of the line segment L (from (1,0) to origin) and
# an infinite number of line segments L_n (from (1, 1/n) to origin).
# All these segments meet only at the origin (0,0). Because they all share a
# point, the entire space X is connected.

# Step 2: Define the new space X' by removing the origin.
# X' = X \ {(0,0)}
# This single removal action has a dramatic effect on connectivity.

# Step 3: Analyze the resulting pieces.
# The origin (0,0) was the ONLY point connecting the segment L to any L_n,
# and the only point connecting any L_n to any other L_m (for n != m).
# Removing the origin severs all of these connections.

# The resulting pieces are:
# 1. The original segment L, minus the origin. Let's call this piece C_0.
#    C_0 is a connected set.
# 2. For each positive integer n, the original segment L_n, minus the origin. Let's call these C_n.
#    Each C_n (for n=1, 2, 3, ...) is also a connected set.

# Since all these pieces are disjoint from one another, they are the
# connected components of the new space X'.

print("\n--- Counting the Connected Components ---")

# Step 4: Count the components.
# The set of connected components is {C_0, C_1, C_2, C_3, ...}.
# To find the total number of components, we just need to count the elements in this set.

print("We can formulate an equation for the total number of components:")
print("Total Components = (Number of components from L) + (Number of components from all L_n)")

num_components_from_L = 1
print(f"\n1. The number of components from the segment L is: {num_components_from_L}")

print("\n2. The number of components from the segments L_n is one for each positive integer (n=1, 2, 3, ...).")
print("This corresponds to the count of the set {1, 2, 3, ...}, which is countably infinite.")
print("   Number of components from L_n = Infinity")

print("\n--- Final Calculation ---")
print("The final equation for the total number of components is:")
# The 'equation' combines the counts.
print(f"Total Components = {num_components_from_L} + Infinity")

print("\nThe sum is therefore countably infinite.")
print("\nFinal Answer: The space has a countably infinite number of connected components.")
