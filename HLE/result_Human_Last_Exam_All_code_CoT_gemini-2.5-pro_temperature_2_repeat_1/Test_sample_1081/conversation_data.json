    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a reductive group of type $E_8$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework**: The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n\n2.  **Specialization to Type $E_8$**: For any group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the situation simplifies considerably.\n    *   By Lang's theorem, any reductive algebraic group over a finite field is quasi-split.\n    *   For a quasi-split group, the action of the Frobenius map $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ corresponds to an automorphism of the group's Dynkin diagram.\n    *   The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group.\n    *   Therefore, the Frobenius map $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Problem**: When $F$ acts trivially, an $F$-conjugacy class $\\{xwx^{-1} | x \\in W\\}$ becomes a standard conjugacy class. Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n4.  **Result from Group Theory**: The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite group of order $696,729,600$. A direct computation of its conjugacy classes is too complex for a simple script. However, this is a well-known result in mathematics. The number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ has been determined to be 112.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that states this reasoning and prints the final answer in the form of an equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n# of a reductive group G of type E_8 over the finite field F_q.\n\n# The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G over F_q is equal to\n# the number of F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W, where F is the Frobenius endomorphism.\n# For a group of type E_8, any such group over a finite field is split. This implies\n# that the Frobenius map F acts trivially on the Weyl group W.\n# Therefore, the F-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of W.\n# The problem is thus equivalent to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E_8).\n\n# The number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) is a known result from the theory of Weyl groups.\n# A direct computation is computationally very expensive due to the large order of W(E_8),\n# which is |W(E_8)| = 2^14 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7 = 696,729,600.\n# The number of its conjugacy classes has been established to be 112.\n\nnum_tori = 112\n\nprint(\"Let G be a reductive group of type E_8 over the finite field F_q.\")\nprint(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G corresponds to the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group, W(E_8).\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal equation:\")\n# The following line outputs the numbers in the final equation format as requested.\nprint(f\"Number of F_q-rational maximal tori = Number of conjugacy classes in W(E_8) = {num_tori}\")\n\n```\n<<<112>>>"
