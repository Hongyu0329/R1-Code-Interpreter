# The problem concerns rolling 100 dice. The key insight lies in the
# prime factorization of the number of sides of a die, which is 6.
num_dice = 100
# The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

# The size of the sample space is N = 6^100 = (2*3)^100 = 2^100 * 3^100.
# The exponents of the prime factors in the size of the sample space
# determine the maximum number of non-trivial mutually independent events.
# Exponent for prime factor 2 is:
exponent_for_2 = 100
# Exponent for prime factor 3 is:
exponent_for_3 = 100

# The maximum number of mutually independent non-trivial events is the sum of these exponents.
max_nontrivial_events = exponent_for_2 + exponent_for_3

# In addition, there are two trivial events: the impossible event (empty set)
# and the certain event (the full sample space). These are independent of any other events.
num_trivial_events = 2

# The largest possible value of m is the sum of the maximum number of
# non-trivial events and the number of trivial events.
m_total = max_nontrivial_events + num_trivial_events
