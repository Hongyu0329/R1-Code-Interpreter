    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\n1. Identify the main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski.\n2. Recall or research the plot of the novel to determine who Adam Zamoyski marries.\n3. According to the story, the main character marries a character named Angelina.\n4. I will write a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\ndef get_character_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the character that the protagonist of\n    \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries Angelina.\n    wife_name = \"Angelina\"\n    return wife_name\n\n# Print the name of the character\nprint(get_character_name())\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
