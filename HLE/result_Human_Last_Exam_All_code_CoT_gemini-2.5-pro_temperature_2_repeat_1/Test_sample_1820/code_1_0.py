    Calculates the theoretical completeness bound for an ontology mapping scenario
    based on the analysis of the problem.

    The problem describes a mapping between two ontologies where one has mergeable
    sibling classes and the other has a strict hierarchy. Based on principles from
    information theory applied to graph structures, the most plausible theoretical
    bound on mapping completeness is given by the formula ln(b)/d.

    This script calculates the value of this bound using the provided parameters.
