# The problem requires translating a number from a Cumbrian sheep-counting dialect
# to a Derbyshire one.

# Step 1: Define the terms and their numeric values from the Cumbrian dialect (Kirkby Lonsdale).
# "tyaan'eboon" is a variation of "Teyan-a-Bumfit", which represents the number 16.
cumbrian_term = "tyaan'eboon"
numeric_value = 16

# Step 2: Define the equivalent term in the Derbyshire dialect.
# The word for 16 in the Derbyshire system is "Yan-a-Gigget".
derbyshire_term = "Yan-a-Gigget"

# Step 3: Print the final answer in a clear sentence, showing the original number in the equation.
print(f"The term '{cumbrian_term}', which represents the number {numeric_value},")
print(f"would be said as '{derbyshire_term}' by a Derbyshireman.")
print("\nSo the final conversion is:")
print(f"{cumbrian_term} ({numeric_value}) = {derbyshire_term} ({numeric_value})")
