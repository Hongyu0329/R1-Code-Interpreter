    "My plan is to determine the answer by following these steps:\n1.  Establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  Research Geoffrey Chaucer's known activities and locations during that specific time period. I will check historical records regarding his service to the English crown.\n3.  Synthesize the information. There is no computational calculation involved; instead, the code will present the historical facts and the reasoning that leads to the correct answer.\n4.  Based on the findings, select the correct option from the provided choices. The final script will print out the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Define the key historical date.\nyear_of_death = 1368\nperson_died = \"Blanche of Lancaster\"\n\n# Step 2: Establish known facts about Geoffrey Chaucer's life around that time.\nchaucers_status_by_1367 = \"Esquire in the household of King Edward III\"\nknown_location_of_service = \"England\"\n\n# Step 3: Present the reasoning based on historical evidence.\nprint(f\"To determine where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died, we need to look at the historical timeline.\")\nprint(f\"1. Blanche of Lancaster died in {year_of_death}.\")\nprint(f\"2. By 1367, Geoffrey Chaucer was known to be an {chaucers_status_by_1367}, placing him firmly within the royal court in {known_location_of_service}.\")\nprint(\"3. While Chaucer did travel abroad on diplomatic missions, his famous trips to Italy occurred later, starting in 1372.\")\nprint(\"4. Furthermore, Chaucer's first major work, 'The Book of the Duchess', is an elegy written in memory of Blanche of Lancaster. This poem strongly connects him to the English court and its affairs at that time.\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion: All available historical evidence indicates that Chaucer was in England, in service to the royal court, when Blanche of Lancaster passed away.\")\n\n# Step 4: Identify the correct answer choice.\nanswer_choices = {\n    'A': 'Italy',\n    'B': 'France',\n    'C': 'England',\n    'D': 'Unknown',\n    'E': 'Scotland'\n}\n\ncorrect_answer_letter = 'C'\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: {answer_choices[correct_answer_letter]}.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
