# The final formula is derived from the parameters provided.
# This script will construct and print the formula as a string.
# Each variable in the equation corresponds to a definition given in the problem.

# Define the components of the numerator and denominator for clarity
numerator_expression = "b * pg * c * pt * 𝜏"
denominator_expression = "(𝛾t + 𝜇t) * 𝜇g * (𝜏 + 𝜇g)"

# Combine the parts into the final equation for R0f
final_equation = f"R0f = ({numerator_expression}) / ({denominator_expression})"

# Print the final expression clearly, showing all the variables (interpreted as "numbers")
# in the final equation as requested.
print("The expression for R0f is:")
