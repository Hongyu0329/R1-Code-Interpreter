    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of independent commutators of order 10. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion provides a series solution for `Z = log(exp(X)exp(Y))` in terms of nested commutators of X and Y. The number of linearly independent terms of a given order `n` in the expansion is given by Witt's formula for the dimension of the `n`-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on `k` generators.\n\nThe formula is:\n`L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order, which is 10 in this case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators (X and Y), so `k=2`.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  Set the order `n = 10` and the number of generators `k = 2`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n=10`. They are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n3.  Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor `d`:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1`\n    *   `μ(5) = -1`\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2*5) = 1`\n4.  Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` in the summation.\n5.  Sum these terms and divide by `n`.\n6.  The script will perform these calculations and print the full equation with the intermediate values, as well as the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_term_count(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order n\n    using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * Σ_{{d|{n}}} μ(d) * {k}^({n}/d)\\n\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    calculation_parts = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k**power)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        # Build strings for pretty printing the equation\n        mu_str = f\"μ({d})\"\n        power_str = f\"{k}^({n}/{d})\"\n        \n        mu_val_str = f\"({mu_d})\" if mu_d < 0 else str(mu_d)\n        val_str = f\"{k}^{power}\"\n        \n        equation_parts.append(f\"{mu_str}*{power_str}\")\n        calculation_parts.append(f\"{mu_val_str}*{val_str}\")\n        \n    print(\"Substituting the divisors of 10 (1, 2, 5, 10):\")\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/10) * [ {' + '.join(equation_parts)} ]\")\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/10) * [ {' + '.join(calculation_parts)} ]\")\n\n    calc_terms = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        k_pow_val = k ** power\n        term = mu_d * k_pow_val\n        mu_val_str = f\"({mu_d})\" if mu_d < 0 else str(mu_d)\n        calc_terms.append(f\"{mu_val_str}*{k_pow_val}\")\n\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/10) * [ {' + '.join(calc_terms).replace('+ -', '- ')} ]\")\n\n    sum_terms = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        term = mobius(d) * (k**(n//d))\n        sum_terms.append(str(term))\n\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/10) * [ {' + '.join(sum_terms).replace('+ -', '- ')} ]\")\n\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/10) * ({total_sum})\")\n    \n    result = total_sum // n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {result}\")\n    \n    return result\n\n# Parameters for the problem\norder_n = 10\ngenerators_k = 2\n\n# Execute the calculation\nfinal_answer = calculate_bch_term_count(order_n, generators_k)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
