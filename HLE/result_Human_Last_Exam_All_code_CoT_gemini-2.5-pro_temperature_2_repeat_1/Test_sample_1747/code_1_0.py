    Calculates the number of regular rigid indecomposable modules for the specified path algebra.
    
    The problem describes a complex path algebra A of a quiver Q, denoted as type A_tilde_{2,3}.
    The quiver has two vertices, v_start and v_end, connected by two paths:
    1. A path of length 2.
    2. A path of length 3.
    """
    
    # Step 1: Characterize the quiver and its algebra.
    # The path of length 2 (v_start -> v_i1 -> v_end) has 2 arrows and 1 intermediate vertex.
    # The path of length 3 (v_start -> v_i2 -> v_i3 -> v_end) has 3 arrows and 2 intermediate vertices.
    # Total vertices in the quiver: 2 (start/end) + 1 (from path 1) + 2 (from path 2) = 5 vertices.
    # Total arrows: 2 (from path 1) + 3 (from path 2) = 5 arrows.

    # The underlying unoriented graph of this quiver forms a cycle. Let's trace it:
    # v_start is connected to v_i1 and v_i2.
    # v_end is connected to v_i1 and v_i3.
    # v_i2 is connected to v_i3.
    # The cycle is v_start - v_i1 - v_end - v_i3 - v_i2 - v_start.
    # This is a 5-cycle, which is the extended Dynkin diagram of type A_tilde_4.
    # A path algebra over such a quiver is a tame hereditary algebra.

    # Step 2: Relate regular rigid indecomposable modules to the algebra type.
    # For a tame hereditary algebra, regular rigid indecomposable modules correspond to the
    # quasi-simple modules in the exceptional stable tubes of its Auslander-Reiten quiver.
    # The number of such modules is the sum of the ranks of these exceptional tubes.
    
    # Step 3: Determine the ranks of the exceptional tubes.
    # For a quiver of type A_tilde_{n-1} (an n-cycle), the orientation determines the ranks.
    # The quiver consists of all arrows from the two paths pointing from v_start to v_end.
    # If we orient the cycle (e.g., v_start -> v_i1 -> ...), we find that the arrows form
    # two oppositely oriented paths along this cycle.
    # The lengths of these paths determine the ranks of the exceptional tubes.
    # Here, the path lengths are given in the problem description.
    
    p = 2  # Length of the first path
    q = 3  # Length of the second path

    # For a cyclic quiver of type A_tilde_{p+q-1} formed this way, with gcd(p,q)=1,
    # there are two exceptional tubes with ranks p and q.
    
    rank_tube_1 = p
    rank_tube_2 = q
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of regular rigid indecomposable modules.
    # This is the sum of the ranks of the exceptional tubes.
    total_modules = rank_tube_1 + rank_tube_2
