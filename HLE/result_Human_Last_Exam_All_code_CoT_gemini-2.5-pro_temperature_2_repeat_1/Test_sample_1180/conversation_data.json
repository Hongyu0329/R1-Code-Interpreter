    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The user is asking for the \"thickness\" of a double point in the stable reduction of the hyperelliptic curve $C: z^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n2.  The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$. The prime of interest is $p=2$, and the valuation $v$ is normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\n3.  I will use the Newton polygon method to find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are pairs $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$ in $f(x)$.\n4.  The slopes of the segments of the lower convex hull of these vertices determine the valuations of the roots. Specifically, if a segment has slope $m$, there are roots with valuation $-m$. The length of the segment's projection onto the x-axis gives the number of such roots.\n5.  The stable reduction is achieved over a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The structure of its special fiber consists of components corresponding to clusters of roots with the same valuation. These components are joined at double points (nodes).\n6.  The thickness of a node connecting two components is an integer $k$ in the local equation $UV = \\pi^k$, where $\\pi$ is the uniformizer of the ring of integers of the extension field. This integer can be calculated from the root valuations and their multiplicities. A common formula gives the thickness as the difference of the integerized valuations multiplied by the gcd of the number of roots in the clusters.\n7.  Finally, the question asks for the thickness with respect to the valuation $v$ normalized by $v(2)=1$. This is interpreted as computing $v(\\pi^k)$, which connects the integer thickness $k$ back to the original valuation.\n\nThis step-by-step process allows me to systematically break down the problem and use established methods from arithmetic geometry to find the solution. The calculations involved are straightforward and can be scripted.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_curve_thickness():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction\n    of the curve z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1 above 2.\n\n    The overall plan is as follows:\n    1. The curve is a hyperelliptic curve defined by z^2 = f(x), where f(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    2. The structure of the stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of f(x).\n    3. We use the Newton polygon of f(x) with respect to the 2-adic valuation v (normalized by v(2)=1) to find these valuations.\n    4. The vertices of the Newton polygon are the points (i, v(a_i)), where a_i is the coefficient of x^i in f(x).\n    5. The slopes of the segments of the lower convex hull of these points give the opposite of the valuations of the roots.\n    6. The thickness of the double point connecting components corresponding to different root valuations can then be calculated.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the coefficients of the polynomial f(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    coeffs = {5: 2, 3: 2, 0: 1}\n\n    # The valuation v is normalized to v(2)=1.\n    def v(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        if n == 2:\n            return 1\n        return None\n\n    print(\"The curve is defined by z^2 = f(x), where f(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\")\n    print(\"We will analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of f(x) using its Newton polygon.\")\n    print(\"The valuation v is normalized such that v(2) = 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Determine the points for the Newton polygon: (i, v(a_i)).\n    p0 = (0, v(coeffs[0]))\n    p3 = (3, v(coeffs[3]))\n    p5 = (5, v(coeffs[5]))\n\n    print(f\"The non-zero coefficients are a_0 = {coeffs[0]}, a_3 = {coeffs[3]}, a_5 = {coeffs[5]}.\")\n    print(f\"Their 2-adic valuations are v(a_0) = {p0[1]}, v(a_3) = {p3[1]}, v(a_5) = {p5[1]}.\")\n    print(f\"The points for the Newton polygon's lower convex hull are {p0}, {p3}, {p5}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Calculate the slopes of the segments and the corresponding root valuations.\n    # Segment 1: from p0 to p3\n    slope1 = (p3[1] - p0[1]) / (p3[0] - p0[0])\n    num_roots1 = p3[0] - p0[0]\n    valuation1 = -slope1\n    \n    # Segment 2: from p3 to p5\n    slope2 = (p5[1] - p3[1]) / (p5[0] - p3[0])\n    num_roots2 = p5[0] - p3[0]\n    valuation2 = -slope2\n\n    print(f\"The first segment is from {p0} to {p3}.\")\n    print(f\"  - Slope = ({p3[1]} - {p0[1]}) / ({p3[0]} - {p0[0]}) = 1/3\")\n    print(f\"  - This implies there are {num_roots1} roots with valuation -(1/3) = {valuation1:.3f}\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(f\"The second segment is from {p3} to {p5}.\")\n    print(f\"  - Slope = ({p5[1]} - {p3[1]}) / ({p5[0]} - {p3[0]}) = 0\")\n    print(f\"  - This implies there are {num_roots2} roots with valuation -0 = {valuation2:.3f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Compute the thickness.
