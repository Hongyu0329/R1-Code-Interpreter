# Analysis of the Rust code's compile-time behavior

# The primary error is in the Tokenizer::tokenize method.
# Let's break down the problematic line:
# `self.word_counts.iter_mut().find(|(w, _)| w == word)`

# 1. `self.word_counts` has type `Vec<(String, usize)>`
# 2. `iter_mut()` creates an `Iterator` with `Item = &mut (String, usize)`
# 3. `find()`'s closure takes an argument of type `&Item`, which is `&(&mut (String, usize))`
# 4. The pattern `(w, _)` attempts to move-destructure the tuple.
# 5. `w` would be of type `String`, which requires moving the value.
# 6. Moving a `String` (which is not `Copy`) out from behind a shared reference (`&`) is a compile error.
