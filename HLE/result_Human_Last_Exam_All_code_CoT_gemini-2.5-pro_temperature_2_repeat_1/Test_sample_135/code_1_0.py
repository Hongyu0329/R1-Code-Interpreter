# The user wants me to identify the incorrect statement about teachers' judgment accuracy.
# I will analyze each option based on well-established educational research findings.

# Statement A: Experienced teachers often overestimate students' academic achievement.
# Research finding: This is an oversimplification. Teachers often overestimate low-achievers but may underestimate high-achievers.
# So, it's not a clear-cut general tendency for all students. This makes it a possible incorrect statement.

# Statement B: Experienced teacher judgment accuracy correlates with students' achievement around r = .6.
# Research finding: This is a robust finding from major meta-analyses (e.g., Südkamp, Kaiser, & Möller, 2012 found r = .63).
# This statement is correct.

# Statement C: Experienced teachers have more difficulty accurately judging low-performing students.
# Research finding: This is a classic finding. Accuracy is lower for students at the performance extremes, and a common bias is overestimating low-performers.
# This statement is correct.

# Statement D: Experienced teachers are typically more accurate in assessing student performance than student teachers.
# Research finding: Experience is a positive, albeit sometimes small, predictor of judgment accuracy.
# This statement is correct.

# Statement E: Experienced teachers’ judgement accuracy on students achievement is higher than on students motivation.
# Research finding: Judging cognitive-performance traits (achievement) is demonstrably more accurate than judging non-cognitive/affective traits (motivation).
# This statement is correct.

# Conclusion: Statements B, C, D, and E are all correct summaries of research.
# Statement A is the most likely incorrect statement because the bias is not a simple, uniform overestimation.
# It's more nuanced, with different biases for different performance groups.
