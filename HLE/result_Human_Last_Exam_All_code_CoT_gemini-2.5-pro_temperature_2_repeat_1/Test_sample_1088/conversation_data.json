    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set is not a single value; it depends on the chemical element. A basis set provides a different set of functions for each unique atom in a molecule.\n\nI will provide a Python script that calculates the number of primitive Gaussians for the `6-311G**` basis set for two representative atoms: Hydrogen (H) and Carbon (C).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):**\n    *   **6**: The core orbitals (like the 1s orbital in Carbon) are represented by a single contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are more flexible. They are represented by three separate contracted functions. These are composed of **3**, **1**, and **1** primitive Gaussians, respectively. For an atom like Carbon, these primitives are used for both the `s` and `p` valence orbitals.\n    *   **\\*** (the first asterisk): This adds a single set of `d`-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" atoms (any atom other than H or He). This set is composed of **1** primitive Gaussian.\n    *   **\\*** (the second asterisk): This adds a single set of `p`-type polarization functions to Hydrogen atoms. This set is composed of **1** primitive Gaussian.\n\n2.  **Calculate for Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core orbitals.\n    *   Its valence `1s` orbital is described by the `311` part, giving `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` `s`-type primitives.\n    *   The second `*` adds `1` `p`-type polarization primitive.\n    *   Total for H = 5 (s) + 1 (p) = 6 primitives.\n\n3.  **Calculate for Carbon (C):**\n    *   Carbon has a `1s` core orbital described by the `6` part, giving **6** core `s`-type primitives.\n    *   Its valence `2s` and `2p` orbitals are described by the `311` part. This gives `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives for the valence `s` functions and another `5` for the valence `p` functions.\n    *   The first `*` adds **1** `d`-type polarization primitive.\n    *   Total for C = 6 (core s) + 5 (valence s) + 5 (valence p) + 1 (d polarization) = 17 primitives.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    The code will formalize these steps into a function and print the final equations clearly.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_primitives_6_311G_star_star(element_symbol):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of primitive Gaussians for an element\n    in the 6-311G** basis set.
