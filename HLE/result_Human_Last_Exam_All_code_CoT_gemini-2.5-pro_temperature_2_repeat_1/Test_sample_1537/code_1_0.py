# The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset of a group G with certain properties.

# Step 1: Analyze the structure of the group G.
# The given properties imply that G is topologically homeomorphic to a product K x D,
# where K is a connected topological group and D is a discrete group.
# For G to have cardinality c, we must have |K| * |D| = c.

# Step 2: Analyze the components of an open subset of G.
# Let X be an open subset of G. Its components are of the form J x {d},
# where J is a component of the open "slice" X_d, an open subset of K.
# A component J x {d} is non-open if and only if J is a non-open component of X_d.

# Step 3: Determine the required property of K.
# The components of open subsets of a space are always open if and only if the space is locally connected.
# To get non-open components, the connected group K must NOT be locally connected.

# Step 4: Find a suitable group K and an open set.
# An example of a connected topological group that is not locally connected is a solenoid.
# A solenoid K has cardinality c, is connected, and is a Hausdorff topological group.
# We can let G = K.
# It is a known result in point-set topology that in such non-locally-connected spaces,
# one can construct open subsets that have c non-open components.

# Step 5: State the maximum number.
# The number of components of any set is at most its cardinality. Since the open subset is a subset of G,
# its cardinality is at most c. Therefore, the number of non-open components is at most c.
# Since we have found a case that achieves c, this is the maximum possible number.

# The result is 'c', the cardinality of the continuum. Since this is a mathematical symbol
# for a transfinite number, we represent it as a string in the output.
