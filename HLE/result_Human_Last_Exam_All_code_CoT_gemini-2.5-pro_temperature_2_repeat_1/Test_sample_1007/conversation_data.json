    "To determine which ballet step has the same ending leg position as the starting position, let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:** An entrechat is a jump where the feet rapidly cross. An `entrechat six` starts from the fifth position and involves three changes of the feet in the air. The dancer lands back in the fifth position, but with the feet reversed from their starting position (the foot that was in front is now in back). So, the position changes.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:** `Échappé` means to escape, and it's a jump from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. `Changé` explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet will be reversed from the starting position upon closing back into fifth. So, the position changes.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé:** `Assemblé` means to assemble. In this step, the dancer brushes one foot off the floor, jumps from the supporting leg, and brings (assembles) both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. A basic `assemblé` done to the side (côté) lands back in the exact same fifth position it started from, with the same foot in front. While there are variations of `assemblé` that do change feet (like `dessus` or `dessous`), the fundamental step does not.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:** `Glissade` means to glide. It is a linking step that travels. For a `glissade derrière` (gliding to the side, closing behind), the dancer starts in fifth, the back foot glides to the side, and the front foot then closes *behind* it. This action reverses the feet, so the position changes.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex jump, like a `pas de chat` but with a circular movement (`rond de jambe`) from each leg. This step finishes in fifth position with the feet reversed from the start. So, the position changes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the `assemblé` is the only step on the list that, in its basic form, starts and ends in the exact same foot position.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same position it starts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    steps = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"Entrechat six\",\n            \"description\": \"Starts in fifth position, lands in fifth position, but with the feet changed.\",\n            \"ends_same\": False\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"name\": \"Échappé battu changé\",\n            \"description\": \"The term 'changé' explicitly means the feet are changed at the end of the step.\",\n            \"ends_same\": False\n        },\n        \"C\": {\n            \"name\": \"Assemblé\",\n            \"description\": \"A basic assemblé starts and ends in the same fifth position without changing feet.\",\n            \"ends_same\": True\n        },\n        \"D\": {\n            \"name\": \"Glissade derrière\",\n            \"description\": \"A gliding step where the starting front foot closes in the back, changing the position.\",\n            \"ends_same\": False\n        },\n        \"E\": {\n            \"name\": \"Gargouillade\",\n            \"description\": \"A complex jump that results in the feet changing their starting position.\",\n            \"ends_same\": False\n        }\n    }\n\n    correct_answer = None\n    correct_choice = None\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the Ballet Steps:\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------\")\n    for choice, details in steps.items():\n        print(f\"Choice {choice}. {details['name']}:\")\n        print(f\"   - {details['description']}\")\n        if details['ends_same']:\n            correct_answer = details['name']\n            correct_choice = choice\n            \n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The only step listed that starts and ends in the exact same leg position is the Assemblé.\")\n    print(f\"The correct answer is C.\")\n\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
