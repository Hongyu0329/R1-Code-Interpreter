    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we need to find polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ such that:\n1.  $D(s)$ is invertible (i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ is not the zero polynomial).\n2.  $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ holds, which ensures that all elements of $N(s)$ are polynomials.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. A practical test for this is that the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$ must be equal to the McMillan degree of $H(s)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given transfer function:\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe poles of the elements are at $s = -1$ and $s = \\pm 1$. The minimal polynomial that covers all denominators is $s^2-1 = (s+1)(s-1)$. The McMillan degree of this system is 2, which corresponds to the poles at $s=-1$ and $s=1$. Therefore, for a coprime factorization, we require $\\deg(\\det(D(s))) = 2$.\n\nLet's find a suitable $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. The matrix product $N(s)=D(s)H(s)$ is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, we have the following requirements:\n-   $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n-   The expressions in the first column must also be polynomials. This means the denominators must be canceled.\n\nLet's focus on the first row. The term $d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. Multiplying by the common denominator $s^2-1 = (s+1)(s-1)$ gives the condition that $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\nThis implies:\n-   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1) = 0$. So, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of $d_{12}(s)$.\n-   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n\nWe seek the simplest polynomial solution. Let's try $d_{12}(s) = c(s-1)$. Substituting this into the second condition gives $2d_{11}(-1) + c(-2) = 0 \\implies d_{11}(-1) = c$. The simplest polynomial for $d_{11}(s)$ is the constant $d_{11}(s)=c$. Let's choose $c=1$.\nSo, the first row of $D(s)$ can be $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nFor the second row, the term $d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This leads to the same conditions for $d_{21}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$:\n-   $d_{22}(1)=0$, so $(s-1)$ is a factor of $d_{22}(s)$.\n-   $2d_{21}(-1)+d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n\nLet's again find a simple solution. We can choose $d_{22}(s)=0$. This satisfies the first condition. The second condition becomes $2d_{21}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{21}(-1)=0$. So, $(s+1)$ must be a factor of $d_{21}(s)$. The simplest choice is $d_{21}(s) = s+1$.\nSo, the second row of $D(s)$ can be $\\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThis gives us the candidate matrix:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nIts determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = 1 \\cdot 0 - (s-1)(s+1) = -(s^2-1) = 1-s^2$. The degree is 2, which matches the McMillan degree. Thus, this choice of $D(s)$ should lead to a coprime factorization.\n\nNow, we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{(s+1)(s-1)}{s+1} & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe following Python code will print the resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a left coprime factorization for the given transfer function.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # The factorization is found to be H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    # where D(s) and N(s) are the polynomial matrices defined below.\n\n    D_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [s + 1, 0]\n    ])\n\n    N_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [s - 1, s + 1]\n    ])\n    \n    # We present the final factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) by printing D(s) and N(s)\n    # in a clear, formatted way.\n    \n    print(\"A left coprime factorization is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s), where:\")\n    \n    # The requirement is to output each number/expression in the final equation.\n    # The \"final equation\" defines D(s) and N(s).\n    \n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    print(f\"[{D_s[0, 0]:>7} {D_s[0, 1]:>7}]\")\n    print(f\"[{D_s[1, 0]:>7} {D_s[1, 1]:>7}]\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    print(f\"[{N_s[0, 0]:>7} {N_s[0, 1]:>7}]\")\n    print(f\"[{N_s[1, 0]:>7} {N_s[1, 1]:>7}]\")\n\n\nsolve_factorization()\n```\n<<<\nD(s) = [[1, s - 1], [s + 1, 0]]\nN(s) = [[1, 1], [s - 1, s + 1]]\n>>>"
