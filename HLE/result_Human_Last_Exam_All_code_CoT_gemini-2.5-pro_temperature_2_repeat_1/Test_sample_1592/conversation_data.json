    "My plan is to identify the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec. Waskaganish is located on the southeastern shore of James Bay. By looking at a map, its nearest neighbours (other than Quebec itself) are Ontario to the west and the territory of Nunavut, which includes the islands in James Bay to the north.\n\nTo determine which is closer, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish.\n2.  Identify the coordinates of the nearest point in Ontario and the nearest point in Nunavut.\n    *   The Ontario-Quebec land border is just west of Waskaganish. I will use a point on this border at the same latitude as Waskaganish.\n    *   The closest part of Nunavut is the southern tip of Akimiski Island in James Bay.\n3.  Calculate the great-circle distance from Waskaganish to both these points using the Haversine formula.\n4.  Compare the two distances to find the minimum. The province or territory corresponding to the shorter distance will be the answer.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2 = map(math.radians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2])\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2 - lon1\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    r = 6371  # Radius of earth in kilometers.\n    return c * r\n\n# Coordinates of the locations\nwaskaganish_qc = {\"name\": \"Waskaganish, QC\", \"lat\": 51.48, \"lon\": -78.76}\nontario_border = {\"name\": \"Ontario Border\", \"lat\": 51.48, \"lon\": -79.52} # Approx. location of the ON-QC border at the same latitude\nnunavut_island = {\"name\": \"Akimiski Island, NU\", \"lat\": 52.99, \"lon\": -81.33} # Southernmost tip of the closest island in Nunavut\n\n# Calculate distances\ndist_to_ontario = haversine_distance(waskaganish_qc[\"lat\"], waskaganish_qc[\"lon\"], ontario_border[\"lat\"], ontario_border[\"lon\"])\ndist_to_nunavut = haversine_distance(waskaganish_qc[\"lat\"], waskaganish_qc[\"lon\"], nunavut_island[\"lat\"], nunavut_island[\"lon\"])\n\nprint(f\"Calculating distances from {waskaganish_qc['name']}...\")\nprint(f\"Distance to the nearest point in Ontario: {dist_to_ontario:.2f} km\")\nprint(f\"Distance to the nearest point in Nunavut (Akimiski Island): {dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Determine the closest province/territory\nif dist_to_ontario < dist_to_nunavut:\n    closest_place = \"Ontario\"\nelse:\n    closest_place = \"Nunavut\"\n\nprint(f\"The closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_place}.\")\n\n<<<Ontario>>>\n```"
