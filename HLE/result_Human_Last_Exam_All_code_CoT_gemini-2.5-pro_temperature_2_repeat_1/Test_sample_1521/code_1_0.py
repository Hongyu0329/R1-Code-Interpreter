    This function analyzes the properties of two Markov chains based on the problem description.

    Problem Summary:
    1.  An irreducible Markov chain P on a state space Σ has a finite subset A.
    2.  There exists a function h(x) which is 0 on A, positive elsewhere, and harmonic outside A.
    3.  h(x) -> ∞ as x -> ∞.
    Question 1: Is the original chain P recurrent ('r') or transient ('t')?

    4.  A new Markov chain Q is defined with transitions q(x,y) = p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x).
    Question 2: Is the new chain Q recurrent ('r') or transient ('t')?

    Reasoning:

    For the first question:
    The existence of a function h with the given properties is a classic test for transience.
    A recurrent chain would visit the finite set A with probability 1 from any starting state.
    This implies that the only non-negative function that is harmonic outside A and zero on A is the function that is identically zero.
    Since we are given that such a function h exists and is strictly positive outside A, this contradicts the properties of a recurrent chain.
    Thus, the original chain P must be transient.

    For the second question:
    The new chain Q is a Doob h-transform of P. This transformation is known to have specific properties.
    Let's consider the function g(x) = 1/h(x) on the state space of the new chain (which is Σ \ A).
    Let's check if g(x) is harmonic for Q:
    E_q[g(Y_1) | Y_0=x] = Σ_y q(x,y)g(y)
                       = Σ_y (p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x)) * (1/h(y))
                       = (1/h(x)) * Σ_y p(x,y)
                       = 1/h(x) = g(x)
    So, g(x) is a positive harmonic function for the new chain Q.
    A Markov chain is recurrent if and only if every positive harmonic function is constant.
    Since h(x) -> ∞, it is not constant, so g(x) = 1/h(x) is also not constant.
    The existence of a non-constant positive harmonic function g(x) implies that the chain Q must be transient.
