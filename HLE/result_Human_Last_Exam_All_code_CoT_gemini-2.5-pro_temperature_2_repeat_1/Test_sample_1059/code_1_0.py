def find_closepact_sets():
  """
  This function determines which of the given mathematical sets are "closepact".

  As explained in the reasoning, for these examples, "closepact in itself"
  is equivalent to the property of being "compact". We identify the compact sets.
  - C: A finite set is always compact.
  - G: A bounded monotonic sequence plus its limit is a closed and bounded set, hence compact.
  - J: A closed interval is closed and bounded, hence compact.
  - M: The Cantor set is closed and bounded, hence compact.
  The other options describe sets that are not necessarily compact.
