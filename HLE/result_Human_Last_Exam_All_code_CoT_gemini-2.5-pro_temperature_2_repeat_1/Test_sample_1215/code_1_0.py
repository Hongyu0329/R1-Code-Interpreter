    print("Let's check if a formula φ that is logically equivalent to a single variable p meets all conditions over n variables.")
    print(" - Condition 1 (Satisfying Assignments): φ is true if and only if p is true. The other (n-1) variables can be anything, giving 1 * 2^(n-1) satisfying assignments. This works.")
