    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct submatrix blocks that are handled by a hierarchical matrix algorithm. I will interpret \"submatrices accessed\" as the total number of logical blocks the algorithm processes.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Model the Hierarchy:** A Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix is based on a recursive partitioning of the matrix. A tree of depth `d=4` means there are 4 levels of partitioning (from level 0 to 3), which result in leaf nodes at level 4.\n2.  **Count Off-Diagonal Blocks:** At each partitioning step, a matrix block is split into a 2x2 structure. The two off-diagonal blocks (`A_12` and `A_21`) are compressed and stored. We need to count how many such blocks are generated across all levels of the hierarchy.\n    *   At level `l` of the partitioning tree (where `l` goes from 0 to `d-1`), there are `2^l` blocks being partitioned.\n    *   Each partition creates 2 off-diagonal blocks.\n    *   So, level `l` adds `2^l * 2 = 2^(l+1)` off-diagonal submatrices.\n    *   We will sum this for all levels from `l=0` to `l=3` (since depth is 4).\n3.  **Count Leaf Diagonal Blocks:** The recursion stops at the deepest level, `d=4`. The diagonal blocks at this level are no longer partitioned and are stored as dense submatrices.\n    *   At level `d`, there are `2^d` such leaf diagonal blocks.\n4.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of all the off-diagonal blocks from the partitions and all the diagonal blocks at the leaf level.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during matrix multiplication\n    for a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of a given depth.\n\n    The total number is the sum of:\n    1.
