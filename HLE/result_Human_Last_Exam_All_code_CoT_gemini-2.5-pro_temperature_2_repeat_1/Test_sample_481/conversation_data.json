    "I will identify the numerical imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for both the 10mg and 20mg dosages. My search indicates that the 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3105 and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with 3106. I will write a simple Python script to display this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the numerical imprints for Teva brand\n    fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    imprint_10mg = 3105\n    imprint_20mg = 3106\n\n    print(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\n    print(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_imprint_numbers()\n```\n<<<The numbers are 3105 and 3106.>>>"
