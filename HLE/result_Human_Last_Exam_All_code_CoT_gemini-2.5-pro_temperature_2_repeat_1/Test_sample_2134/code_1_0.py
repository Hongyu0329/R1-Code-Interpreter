# The problem asks for the value of x(t) at t = 2*sqrt(3).
# Based on the analysis, the trajectory follows the classical path of the center of the wave packet,
# given by x(t) = x(0) - t^2 / 4.
# This assumes the initial velocity is zero, a consequence of the real-valued initial wavefunction.

# Given time t
t = 2 * math.sqrt(3)

# Calculate t^2
t_squared = t**2

# Calculate the displacement term -t^2 / 4
displacement = -t_squared / 4

# The initial condition is given as:
# x(0) = 3 + (6^(1/3)) * (3 - sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (6^(1/3)) * (3 + sqrt(3))^(1/3)
# We can rewrite this as:
# x(0) = 3 + (6 * (3 - sqrt(3)))^(1/3) + (6 * (3 + sqrt(3)))^(1/3)
# x(0) = 3 + (18 - 6*sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (18 + 6*sqrt(3))^(1/3)

# The value of x at t=2*sqrt(3) is x(2*sqrt(3)) = x(0) + displacement
# x(2*sqrt(3)) = x(0) - 3
# x(2*sqrt(3)) = (3 + (18 - 6*sqrt(3))**(1/3) + (18 + 6*sqrt(3))**(1/3)) - 3
# x(2*sqrt(3)) = (18 - 6*sqrt(3))**(1/3) + (18 + 6*sqrt(3))**(1/3)

# Let's calculate this value.
val1_cbrt = (18 - 6 * math.sqrt(3))**(1/3)
val2_cbrt = (18 + 6 * math.sqrt(3))**(1/3)

result = val1_cbrt + val2_cbrt

# The problem can be interpreted as finding the value of x(0)-3.
# The calculation can be done symbolically and numerically. The cubic equation
# k^3 - 18k - 36 = 0 has the real root k = (18-6*sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (18+6*sqrt(3))^(1/3)
# We will print the numerical value as requested.
# Let's represent the final equation in the output.
