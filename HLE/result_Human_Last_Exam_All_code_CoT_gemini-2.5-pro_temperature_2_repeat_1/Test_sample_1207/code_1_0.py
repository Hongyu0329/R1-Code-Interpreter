    Rationale:

    The patient, a 44-year-old woman, presents with a constellation of symptoms that strongly suggests a specific autoimmune syndrome. The key to solving this case is recognizing a clinical triad.

    1.  Clinical Triad Analysis:
        - Ocular Finding: Transient monocular vision loss is highly suggestive of branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO).
        - CNS Finding: Pulsatile headaches and hearing loss point to involvement of the central nervous system and cochlea (inner ear). The history of psychiatric conditions could also be related or be a comorbidity complicating the picture of encephalopathy.
        - Systemic Findings: Joint pain, dyspnea, and skin lesions point to a multi-system inflammatory disorder.

    2.  Connecting Symptoms to Diagnosis:
        This classic triad of (1) encephalopathy (headaches), (2) branch retinal artery occlusions, and (3) hearing loss is pathognomonic for Susac's Syndrome. Susac's is a rare autoimmune endotheliopathy that causes inflammation and blockage of the smallest blood vessels (microangiopathy) in the brain, retina, and cochlea.

    3.  Expected Imaging Findings:
        The diagnosis of Susac's Syndrome is confirmed by characteristic MRI findings. On a T2-weighted brain MRI, one would expect to see multiple small, circular, hyperintense lesions ("snowball" lesions) located in the central fibers of the corpus callosum. Leptomeningeal enhancement can also be seen due to the inflammation.

    4.  Evaluating the Answer Choices:
        - A: Incorrect. Suggests rheumatoid arthritis, which does not match the specific triad.
        - B: Correct. "Leptomeningeal enhancement with 'snowball' hyperintensities visualized by MRI" is the classic radiological description for Susac's Syndrome.
        - C: Incorrect. A pleural effusion is a non-specific finding and not the primary expected feature.
        - D: Incorrect. While possible in vasculitis, ischemic infarcts (not hemorrhages) are the hallmark of Susac's.
        - E: Incorrect. A pituitary mass causes different visual symptoms and doesn't explain the full clinical picture.
