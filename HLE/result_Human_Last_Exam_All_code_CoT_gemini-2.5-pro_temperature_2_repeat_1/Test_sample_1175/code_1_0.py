# Based on the analytical derivation, the final expression simplifies to the sum of two terms.
# Final expression = (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + 37/4

# Calculate the first term
term1 = 1.5 * (10**(10/3))

# Calculate the second term
term2 = 37 / 4

# The final result is the sum of these two terms.
result = term1 + term2
