    "Of course, I can help with that. Determining the ideal stoichiometry for a catalyst is a common task in materials science and chemistry. The optimal ratio is typically found experimentally and depends heavily on the specific reaction and conditions.\n\nHere is my plan to address your question:\n1.  First, I will research the scientific literature to find the generally accepted optimal Ni/Ce molar ratios for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and for thermochemical Water Splitting (WS). These values are derived from experimental studies that measure catalytic activity and stability.\n2.  For the WGS reaction, the ideal ratio is one that maximizes the dispersion of Ni active sites and promotes the strong metal-support interaction with ceria, which enhances performance and prevents deactivation.\n3.  For thermochemical Water Splitting, Ni is often used as a dopant in the ceria lattice. The optimal ratio enhances the oxygen storage capacity and redox properties of the material without causing detrimental phase separation.\n4.  Finally, I will create a Python script that stores these experimentally-determined ideal ratios and presents them clearly. The script will print the values for each reaction, a brief rationale, and the ratio expressed as an equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides the experimentally determined ideal Ni/Ce molar ratios\n    for Ni-Ceria catalysts in two important reactions: Water Gas Shift (WGS)\n    and Water Splitting (WS).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Ideal Ni/Ce Molar Ratios for Ni-Ceria Nanoparticle Catalysts\")\n    print(\"-\" * 65)\n\n    # --- 1.
