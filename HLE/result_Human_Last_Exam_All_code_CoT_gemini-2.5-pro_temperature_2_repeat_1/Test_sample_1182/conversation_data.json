    "To determine the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we will analyze the geometry of the curve at different 2-adic scales. The stable reduction can be understood by finding a model of the curve that consists of simpler components, whose singularities are only ordinary double points (nodes). The total number of nodes is the sum of nodes on each component plus the number of intersection points between components.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the curve's equation:** We will analyze the valuations of the terms in the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$ for different 2-adic valuations of $x$, i.e., $v_2(x)$. This helps identify regions where the geometry is interesting.\n2.  **Scale the coordinates:** Based on the valuation analysis, we will perform changes of variables (scaling of $x$ and $y$) to \"zoom in\" on these interesting regions. This process reveals the components of the special fiber of a good model of the curve.\n3.  **Identify the components:** After scaling and reducing modulo 2, we will obtain the equations of the components of the stable reduction. We will determine their geometric properties, particularly their arithmetic genus.\n4.  **Determine the structure of the stable model:** The genus of the original curve is 2. The arithmetic genus of the stable model must also be 2. Using the formula for the total genus of a reducible curve ($p_a(\\mathcal{C}) = \\sum p_a(\\mathcal{C}_i) + b_1(G)$, where $G$ is the dual graph of components), we can determine the topological structure of how the components are connected. $b_1(G)$ is the number of loops in the graph.\n5.  **Count the double points:** The number of edges in the dual graph corresponds to the number of intersection points between components. The total number of double points is this number plus the number of singular points on the components themselves.\n\nThis step-by-step analysis can be performed with the following Python code. The code will carry out the scaling calculations and then assemble the results to arrive at the final count of double points.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    count = 0\n    while n % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of double points in the stable reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y, X, Y, Z = sympy.symbols('x y X Y Z')\n    p = 2\n    \n    # Original polynomial f(x)\n    f_coeffs = {5: 8, 4: 4, 3: 4, 2: 1, 1: 8, 0: 0}\n    f = sum(c * x**i for i, c in f_coeffs.items())\n    \n    print(\"The curve is given by y^2 = {}\".format(f))\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analysis for alpha = 3 ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the region where v_2(x) is around 3.\")\n    alpha = 3\n    # v(y^2) = v(f(x)). v(f(2^3*X)) is min of v(a_i * (2^3*X)^i) = v(a_i) + i*3\n    # v(a_1*x)=3+3=6, v(a_2*x^2)=0+6=6, v(a_3*x^3)=2+9=11, v(a_4*x^4)=2+12=14, v(a_5*x^5)=3+15=18\n    # The minimum valuation of f(2^3*X) is 6.\n    # So 2*v(y) = 6, which means v(y)=3.
