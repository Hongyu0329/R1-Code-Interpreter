    # Part A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable?
    # Reasoning: The machine model described is Turing-complete due to its instruction
    # set (arithmetic, universal logic, memory access, conditional branching) and
    # the premise of "sufficiently large" resources (R, A, W), which is analogous
    # to a Turing Machine's infinite tape. Therefore, any function it can compute
    # ("boopable") is by definition Turing-computable.
    answer_A = "Yes"

    # Part B: Does there exist a program L of length <= 2^32+50 such that, for
    # all x in [0, 2^32), L on (R,A,W) maps x to x and halts in <= x+50 many steps?
    # Reasoning: Yes, by using a "BOOP sled" and an initial, constant-time setup
    # phase that calculates an entry point into the sled to produce exactly x boops.
    answer_B = "Yes"

    # The performance constraint for Part B forms an equation.
    # Total Steps = C_setup + x_boops
    # The problem requires: Total Steps <= x + 50
    # Our design fulfills this: C_setup + x <= 50 + x, which is true if C_setup <= 50.
    # The setup calculation can be done in a constant number of steps, well under 50.

    # The prompt requires printing the numbers in the final equation for B.
