    "My plan is to first address the user's request to solve the programming challenge. I will provide a Python script that correctly implements the logic for case-insensitive lexicographical string comparison.\n\nNext, I will tackle the second part of the request, which is to determine the memory usage of the *most memory-efficient C program* for this problem. To do this, I will mentally design the optimal C code, focusing on minimizing memory allocation. The key considerations will be:\n1.  Using character arrays of the exact required size (`100` characters + `1` for the null terminator) to store the input strings, as reading both strings into memory is necessary before comparison.\n2.  Choosing the smallest possible data type for the loop counter. Since the string length is at most 100, a `char` type (1 byte) is sufficient instead of a larger `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n3.  Avoiding the declaration of any unnecessary temporary variables.\n\nFinally, I will calculate the total memory in bytes by summing the sizes of the declared variables: `memory for string1 + memory for string2 + memory for loop counter`. This sum will be my final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the first string from standard input\n        s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        # Read the second string from standard input\n        s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n        # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        s1_lower = s1.lower()\n        s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n        # Compare the lowercase strings and print the result\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n    except (IOError, IndexError) as e:\n        # Handle potential input errors, though problem guarantees valid input\n        # This part is for robust code but not strictly required by the contest problem\n        pass\n\nsolve()\n```\nFor the most memory-efficient C program, the variables needed are:\n1.  `char s1[101];` to store the first string (max 100 chars + 1 null terminator) = 101 bytes.\n2.  `char s2[101];` to store the second string = 101 bytes.\n3.  `char i;` for the loop counter (a `char` is 1 byte and can hold values up to 100) = 1 byte.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n`m = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(s2) + sizeof(i) = 101 + 101 + 1 = 203` bytes.\n\n<<<203>>>"
