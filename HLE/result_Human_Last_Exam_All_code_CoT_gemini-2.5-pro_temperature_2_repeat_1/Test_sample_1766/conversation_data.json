    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve for the common eigenvalues, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: First, we need to identify the relevant quantum numbers for a p-electron. The \"p\" tells us the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. Since it's an electron, its spin quantum number is $s=1/2$.\n\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum $J$ is the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta, $J = L + S$. The corresponding total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, can take values from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n    *   For $l=1$ and $s=1/2$, $j$ can be $|1-1/2|=1/2$ and $1+1/2=3/2$.\n\n3.  **Find Magnetic Quantum Numbers ($m_j$)**: For each value of $j$, the magnetic quantum number $m_j$ can take $2j+1$ values, from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps.\n    *   For $j=3/2$, the possible values of $m_j$ are $-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2$.\n    *   For $j=1/2$, the possible values of $m_j$ are $-1/2, 1/2$.\n\n4.  **Determine Eigenvalues**: The operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ have a common set of eigenstates $|j, m_j\\rangle$.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for $J^2$ is: $J^2 |j, m_j\\rangle = \\hbar^2 j(j+1) |j, m_j\\rangle$.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for $J_z$ is: $J_z |j, m_j\\rangle = \\hbar m_j |j, m_j\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Generate Code**: I will write a Python script to iterate through all allowed combinations of $j$ and $m_j$, calculate the corresponding eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$, and print the complete eigenvalue equations for each state. The `fractions` library will be used to display the quantum numbers and eigenvalues neatly.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_p_electron_eigenvalues():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    The final equations for each eigenstate |j, m_j> are displayed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, orbital angular momentum quantum number l = 1.\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, spin quantum number s = 1/2.\n    s = 0.5\n\n    # Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\n    j_values = []\n    j = abs(l - s)\n    while j <= l + s:\n        j_values.append(j)\n        j += 1\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron with l={l} and s={Fraction(s)}, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {[str(Fraction(val)) for val in j_values]}\\n\")\n\n    hbar_str = \"ħ\"\n    hbar2_str = \"ħ²\"\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j value\n    for j in j_values:\n        j_frac = Fraction(j)\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2, which is j(j+1)\n        j_squared_val = j * (j + 1)\n        j_squared_frac = Fraction(j_squared_val)\n\n        print(f\"--- For states with total angular momentum j = {j_frac} ---\")\n        \n        # Iterate through possible m_j values for the current j\n        m_j = -j\n        while m_j <= j:\n            m_j_frac = Fraction(m_j)\n            \n            # Print the state being considered\n            state_ket = f\"|j={j_frac}, m_j={m_j_frac}⟩\"\n            print(f\"For the common eigenstate {state_ket}:\")\n            \n            # Print J^2 eigenvalue equation\n            print(f\"  J² {state_ket} = {j_frac}*({j_frac} + 1) {hbar2_str} {state_ket} = {j_squared_frac} {hbar2_str} {state_ket}\")\n\n            # Print J_z eigenvalue equation\n            print(f\"  Jz {state_ket} = {m_j_frac} {hbar_str} {state_ket}\\n\")\n\n            m_j += 1\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_p_electron_eigenvalues()\n```\n<<<For j=3/2, the J^2 eigenvalue is (15/4)ħ² with Jz eigenvalues of (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.
