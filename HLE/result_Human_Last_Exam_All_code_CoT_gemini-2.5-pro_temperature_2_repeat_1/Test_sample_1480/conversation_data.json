    "To determine the rule activation level, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the firing level of the antecedent, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the membership value of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n\nA t-norm (triangular norm) is a type of function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic. While there are several types of t-norms (e.g., product, Lukasiewicz), the most commonly used one is the minimum t-norm.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the inputs:** The antecedent firing level `Phi_k(x′)` is 0.7, and the consequent membership value `μG_k_j(y_j)` is 0.9.\n2.  **Choose the operation:** We will use the minimum t-norm, which is defined as `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`.\n3.  **Apply the operation:** We will calculate the minimum of the two input values.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** The script will perform this calculation and print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The given values for the fuzzy rule\nphi_k = 0.7  # Firing level of the antecedent: Phi_k(x′)\nmu_G = 0.9   # Membership value of the consequent: μG_k_j(y_j)\n\n# The t-norm operation combines these values. We will use the most common\n# t-norm, which is the minimum operator.\n# Rule Activation Level = T(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\n# Using minimum t-norm: Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\n\n# Calculate the rule activation level\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation and the result\nprint(f\"Calculating the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G})\")\nprint(f\"The final rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
