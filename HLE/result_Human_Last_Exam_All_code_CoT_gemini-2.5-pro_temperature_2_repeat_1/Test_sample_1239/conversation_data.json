    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that leave the form of the equations unchanged. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters defining these transformations.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  List the fundamental physical symmetries that the equations respect. These include translations, rotations, and changes in the frame of reference (Galilean boosts).\n2.  Identify any scaling symmetries (dilations) that leave the equations invariant.\n3.  Sum the number of independent generators corresponding to each of these symmetries. This sum will be the dimension of the Lie group.\n\nThe symmetries are:\n*   **Time translation:** Shifting the time coordinate, $t \\to t + a$. This transformation is described by 1 parameter.\n*   **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$. Since we are in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this is described by 3 parameters.\n*   **Space rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates, $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$ (where $R \\in SO(3)$ is a rotation matrix). The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, has 3 dimensions.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Changing to a frame of reference moving at a constant velocity, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. This transformation is described by 3 parameters for the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$.\n*   **Scaling:** Rescaling the variables, $t \\to \\lambda^2 t, \\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$. This group of transformations is described by 1 parameter, $\\lambda$.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the parameters for each of these symmetry types. The following code calculates this sum.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of a Lie group of symmetries is the number of its generators.\n# We sum the number of generators for each type of symmetry transformation\n# that leaves the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations invariant.\n\n# Time translation: t' = t + s\ntime_translation = 1\n\n# Space translations: x_i' = x_i + c_i for i=1,2,3\nspace_translations = 3\n\n# Spatial rotations (SO(3) group): x' = Rx\nrotations = 3\n\n# Galilean boosts: x' = x + vt, u' = u + v\ngalilean_boosts = 3\n\n# Scaling (dilation): t' = a^2 t, x' = a x, u' = a^-1 u\nscaling_symmetry = 1\n\n# The total dimension is the sum of these individual components.\ntotal_dimension = (\n    time_translation + \n    space_translations + \n    rotations + \n    galilean_boosts + \n    scaling_symmetry\n)\n\nprint(f\"The dimension is the sum of the generators for each symmetry:\")\nprint(f\"Time Translation: {time_translation}\")\nprint(f\"Space Translations: {space_translations}\")\nprint(f\"Rotations: {rotations}\")\nprint(f\"Galilean Boosts: {galilean_boosts}\")\nprint(f\"Scaling Symmetry: {scaling_symmetry}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Total Dimension = {time_translation} + {space_translations} + {rotations} + {galilean_boosts} + {scaling_symmetry} = {total_dimension}\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
