# The problem is to count the number of set tuples (S1, S2, S3, S4)
# satisfying the given conditions. We can solve this by considering the
# possible placements for each element of the universe U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

# For each element, we determine the number of valid regions it can be placed in,
# based on the constraints S1 <= S2 <= S3 <= S4 <= U and i in Si for i=1,2,3.

# Let's find the number of choices for each element from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

# For element 1, the condition is 1 in S1. It must be in the innermost set.
choices_1 = 1

# For element 2, the condition is 2 in S2. It can be in S1 or S2 \ S1.
choices_2 = 2

# For element 3, the condition is 3 in S3. It can be in S1, S2 \ S1, or S3 \ S2.
choices_3 = 3

# For element 4, there are no specific conditions. It can be anywhere in the 5 regions:
# S1, S2 \ S1, S3 \ S2, S4 \ S3, or U \ S4.
choices_4 = 5

# For element 5, there are no specific conditions either. It also has 5 choices.
choices_5 = 5

# The total number of valid set tuples is the product of these independent choices.
total_sets = choices_1 * choices_2 * choices_3 * choices_4 * choices_5

# Now we print the breakdown of the calculation as requested.
print(f"Number of choices for element 1: {choices_1}")

print("\nThe total number of satisfying set tuples is the product of these choices.")
