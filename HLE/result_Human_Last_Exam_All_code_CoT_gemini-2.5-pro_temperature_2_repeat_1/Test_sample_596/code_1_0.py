def solve_forest_collapse_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem by applying a theorem from PL topology.

    The problem asks for the number of 'higher dimensional rooted forests' (F,R)
    on a triangulation of the Möbius band that do not simplicially collapse to their root R.

    1. Definition of a higher dimensional rooted forest (F,R): F is a subcomplex where
       each connected component is contractible, and R is a set of root vertices,
       one for each component of F.

    2. The key insight comes from a theorem in topology (Hudson, "PL Topology", Thm 3.20):
       Any contractible subcomplex of a triangulated 2-manifold is collapsible.

    3. The Möbius band is a 2-manifold. Its triangulation is a triangulated 2-manifold.
       Therefore, any subcomplex of it is a subcomplex of a triangulated 2-manifold.

    4. By definition, any component F_i of a rooted forest F is contractible.
       By the theorem, this means every F_i is also collapsible.

    5. A collapsible complex can be collapsed to any of its vertices. Thus, each component
       F_i can be collapsed to its root r_i.

    6. This implies that the entire forest F always collapses to its root set R.

    7. Therefore, the number of rooted forests that FAIL to collapse to their roots is 0.
