    "This problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial-topological objects that fail to have a specific property. To solve this, we first need to understand the definitions of the objects and properties involved.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: I will start by defining the key terms in the question: \"higher dimensional rooted forest\", \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\", and \"simplicially collapse\". The term \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" is not universally standard, so I will use the definition most common in the context of enumerative and algebraic combinatorics, which seems to be the origin of this problem.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Core Question**: Based on these definitions, the problem becomes a question about the relationship between two topological properties of a simplicial complex: **contractibility** and **collapsibility**. Specifically, for subcomplexes of a triangulated 2-manifold.\n\n3.  **Invoke a Key Theorem**: The solution hinges on a powerful but somewhat specialized theorem from piecewise-linear (PL) topology concerning subcomplexes of 2-manifolds. I will state this theorem.\n\n4.  **Construct the Argument**: Using the theorem, I will argue that any object qualifying as a \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" under the standard definition *must* possess the property of collapsing to its root.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Code**: The logical conclusion is that no such objects \"fail\" the condition, meaning the count is zero. I will provide a Python script that codifies this conclusion and prints the final answer as requested.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n*   **Standard Triangulation of the Möbius Band**: This is any simplicial complex that is homeomorphic to a Möbius band. The specific details of the triangulation (e.g., the minimal one with 6 vertices and 10 triangles, or a different one) turn out to be irrelevant due to the general topological nature of the solution. Let's call this complex `K`.\n\n*   **Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest**: In this context, a higher dimensional rooted forest of `K` is a pair `(F, R)` where:\n    1.  `F` is a subcomplex of `K`.\n    2.  `R` is a set of vertices of `F`, containing exactly one vertex (the \"root\") for each connected component of `F`.\n    3.  The crucial property that makes `F` a \"forest\" (or \"acyclic\") is that each of its connected components is **contractible**. A space is contractible if it can be continuously shrunk to a single point.\n\n*   **Simplicial Collapse**: A simplicial complex `F` simplicially collapses to a subcomplex `L` (written `F ↘ L`) if `L` can be obtained from `F` by a sequence of \"elementary collapses\". An elementary collapse removes a pair of simplices `(σ, τ)` where `σ` is a maximal simplex in the current complex, and `τ` is a face of `σ` that is not part of any other maximal simplex (a \"free face\"). If `F` collapses to a set of vertices `R`, it means each connected component of `F` collapses to its corresponding root vertex in `R`.\n\n*   **The Question Reformulated**: How many pairs `(F,R)` exist such that `(F,R)` is a higher dimensional rooted forest but `F` does *not* simplicially collapse to `R`?\n\n*   **The Key Theorem**: The resolution of this problem lies in a theorem from PL topology, proven by J. H. C. Whitehead and later refined. A modern reference is Theorem 3.20 in J.F.P. Hudson's \"Piecewise Linear Topology\", which states:\n    > **Theorem**: Any contractible subcomplex of a triangulated 2-manifold is collapsible.\n\n*   **The Argument**:\n    1.  Let `(F, R)` be a higher dimensional rooted forest of the triangulation of the Möbius band.\n    2.  Let `F_i` be any connected component of the forest `F`, and let `r_i` be its corresponding root in `R`.\n    3.  By the definition of a rooted forest, `F_i` is contractible.\n    4.  The Möbius band is a 2-manifold. Therefore, its triangulation `K` is a triangulated 2-manifold. Any subcomplex `F_i` of `K` is a subcomplex of a triangulated 2-manifold.\n    5.  By Hudson's theorem, since `F_i` is a contractible subcomplex of a triangulated 2-manifold, `F_i` must be **collapsible**.\n    6.  A complex being collapsible means it can be simplicially collapsed to a single point. In fact, it can be collapsed to *any* of its vertices. Therefore, `F_i` can be simplicially collapsed to its root vertex `r_i`.\n    7.  Since this holds true for every component `F_i` of the forest `F`, the entire forest `F` simplicially collapses to its root set `R`.\n    8.  This means that the condition \"F simplicially collapses onto the root R\" is a necessary consequence of `(F,R)` being a higher dimensional rooted forest in the first place. Therefore, the number of rooted forests that **fail** to have this property is zero.\n\nThe answer is not a result of a complex calculation but a logical deduction from this topological theorem.\n\n```python\ndef solve_forest_collapse_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by applying a theorem from PL topology.\n\n    The problem asks for the number of 'higher dimensional rooted forests' (F,R)\n    on a triangulation of the Möbius band that do not simplicially collapse to their root R.\n\n    1. Definition of a higher dimensional rooted forest (F,R): F is a subcomplex where\n       each connected component is contractible, and R is a set of root vertices,\n       one for each component of F.\n\n    2. The key insight comes from a theorem in topology (Hudson, \"PL Topology\", Thm 3.20):\n       Any contractible subcomplex of a triangulated 2-manifold is collapsible.\n\n    3. The Möbius band is a 2-manifold. Its triangulation is a triangulated 2-manifold.\n       Therefore, any subcomplex of it is a subcomplex of a triangulated 2-manifold.\n\n    4. By definition, any component F_i of a rooted forest F is contractible.\n       By the theorem, this means every F_i is also collapsible.\n\n    5. A collapsible complex can be collapsed to any of its vertices. Thus, each component\n       F_i can be collapsed to its root r_i.\n\n    6. This implies that the entire forest F always collapses to its root set R.\n\n    7. Therefore, the number of rooted forests that FAIL to collapse to their roots is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The result of the logical deduction.\n    number_of_failing_forests = 0\n\n    # The final equation is: Number = 0\n    print(\"The final equation for the number of non-collapsing rooted forests is:\")\n    print(f\"Number = {number_of_failing_forests}\")\n\n# Execute the solution.\nsolve_forest_collapse_problem()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
