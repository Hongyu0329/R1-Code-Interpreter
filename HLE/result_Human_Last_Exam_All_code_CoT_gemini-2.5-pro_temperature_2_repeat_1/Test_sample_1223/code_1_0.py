    Solves the problem regarding the number of composants of a Stone-Cech remainder.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the
    Stone-Cech remainder of X \ {x}, where X is a hereditary indecomposable
    metric continuum and x is a point in X.

    The solution is derived as follows:

    1.  Let R be the Stone-Cech remainder R = beta(X \ {x}) \ (X \ {x}).
        A theorem by Bellamy states that since X is a hereditary
        indecomposable continuum, the remainder R is also a hereditary
        indecomposable continuum.

    2.  An indecomposable continuum has either 1 composant (if it's a single
        point) or a larger number. A non-degenerate indecomposable metric
        continuum is known to have c = 2^aleph_0 (the cardinality of the
        continuum) a continuum) a continuum) composants.

    3.  To find the maximum possible number, we can check a specific case.
        If we take X to be the pseudo-arc (a canonical example of a
        hereditary indecomposable metric continuum), it is a known result
        that the remainder R is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc itself.

    4.  Since the pseudo-arc is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric
        continuum, it has c composants. This means that the number of
        composants can be c, so the maximum possible number is at least c.

    5.  It can be shown that the number of composants cannot exceed c. This
        is because the remainder R inherits properties from the initial
        metric space X that constrain its complexity (specifically, its
        topological weight is at most c).

    6.  Combining these points, the maximum possible number of composants is c.
