    "My plan is to first identify the specific philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who is known for this particular semiotic distinction. My research indicates this philosopher is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, who, in his work on the philosophy of language, analyzed the concept of signs (or hallmarks) and differentiated between those that are causally linked (symptoms) and those that are intentionally communicative (signals).\n\nI will then create a Python script that stores this philosopher's name in a variable and prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School\n# who made the distinction between \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" as part of the\n# concept of a \"hallmark\" (or sign).\n# The philosopher in question is known for his extensive work in logic,\n# epistemology, and the philosophy of language.\n\nphilosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\nprint(philosopher)\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
