# The Zhigalkin polynomial is:
# P(a,b,c,d) = c ⊕ d ⊕ (b ∧ c) ⊕ (a ∧ c) ⊕ (a ∧ d) ⊕ (a ∧ b ∧ c) ⊕ (a ∧ b ∧ d)
# where ⊕ is XOR and ∧ is AND.

# A Boolean formula equivalent to this polynomial, using only the operators
# from the set (¬, ↑, ↓, ↔︎, →, ∨), is derived through simplification and substitution.

# The simplified formula using standard logic is:
# (b ∧ d) ∨ ((a ↓ b) ∧ ¬(c ↔ d))

# Since ∧ (AND) is not an allowed operator, it is replaced using the identity:
# X ∧ Y ≡ ¬(X → ¬Y)

# Applying this transformation yields the final formula.

final_formula = "¬((a ↓ b) → (c ↔ d)) ∨ ¬(b → ¬d)"
