# Define the given parameters
R0 = 3.0  # Basic reproduction number
infection_rate_in_vaccinated = 0.06 # 6% of vaccinated people get the infection

# Step 1: Calculate the vaccine's effectiveness (VE).
# This is the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are protected from infection.
# VE = 1 - (the rate of infection in vaccinated people)
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - infection_rate_in_vaccinated

# Step 2: Calculate the herd immunity threshold (HIT).
# This is the minimum proportion of the population that needs to be immune
# to stop the virus from spreading. The formula is HIT = 1 - (1/R0).
herd_immunity_threshold = 1 - (1 / R0)

# Step 3: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (Vc).
# This is the proportion of the total population that needs to be vaccinated 
# to achieve herd immunity, accounting for the vaccine's effectiveness.
# The formula is Vc = HIT / VE
critical_vaccination_coverage = herd_immunity_threshold / vaccine_effectiveness
