    print("This phrase suggests a dual action. 'Measures' can refer to a constant, physical process, like the tide defining the shoreline or the waves crossing the space between islands.")
    print("'Re-measures' suggests a second, perhaps more contemplative or different kind of measurement.")

    print("Step 2: Examining the context within the poem.")
    print("Context a) The immediate setting: The poem is set in an 'Archipelago' 'At the grave edge of the world.' The sea physically creates and defines the distance between the islands. This is the first, more literal measurement of distance.")
    print("Context b) The subsequent image: After the sea measures distance, the poem says, 'And the moon unveils herself.' The moon introduces a second, completely different scale of distance: a vast, cosmic, and remote distance.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Connecting the phrase to the context and evaluating the options.")
    print("The sea's action links these two concepts of distance. It 'measures' the immediate, terrestrial distance between islands. Its vastness then prompts a 're-measuring' in the mind of the observer, a contemplation of the immense distance to the moon.")
    print("Option E, 'To evoke different ideas of distance, one in the immediate, one linked to the distance to the moon', is the only choice that captures this duality by connecting the sea's action to both the immediate environment and the specific image of the moon that follows.")
    print("Other options are less complete. A, C, and D miss the crucial connection to the moon. B mentions 'distance' but fails to specify the two distinct types highlighted in the poem.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    print("Conclusion: The best answer is E because it accounts for the two distinct types of distance clearly referenced in the poem: the immediate, earthly distance related to the sea itself, and the vast, cosmic distance symbolized by the moon.")
