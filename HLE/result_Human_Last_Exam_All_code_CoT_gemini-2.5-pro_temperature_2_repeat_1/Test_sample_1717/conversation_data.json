    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode for a single player.\n2.  Next, I will find the official formula the game uses to scale boss health based on the number of players present in Expert Mode.\n3.  I will then analyze this formula by treating the number of players as a variable that approaches infinity. This is a limit calculation.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that presents this formula and its logical conclusion. Since the health increases linearly with the number of players and doesn't have a built-in cap, the theoretical maximum health with infinite players is also infinite. The script will print the formula and its symbolic result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 3640\n    player_scaling_factor = 0.35\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the health scaling formula.\n    # The formula is: Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + ScalingFactor * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n    # Let N be the number of players. The formula becomes: H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))\n    # This simplifies to H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35*N - 0.35) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35*N).\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the formula for an infinite number of players.\n    # As the number of players (N) approaches infinity, the term (0.65 + 0.35*N) also\n    # approaches infinity. This means the total health increases without any upper bound.\n    # Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation with the symbolic representation.\n    num_players_symbol = \"N (approaching infinity)\"\n    final_result = \"Infinity\"\n\n    print(\"Terraria Expert Mode Health Calculation for Eye of Cthulhu\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Base Health: {base_health}\")\n    print(f\"Per-Player Health Scaling Factor: {player_scaling_factor}\")\n    print(\"\\nFormula: Base Health * (1 + Scaling Factor * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nAs the Number of Players approaches infinity, the equation becomes:\")\n\n    # We use strings to represent the symbolic nature of the calculation.\n    equation_str = f\"{base_health} * (1 + {player_scaling_factor} * ({num_players_symbol} - 1)) = {final_result}\"\n    print(equation_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_eoc_health()\n```\n<<<Infinity>>>"
