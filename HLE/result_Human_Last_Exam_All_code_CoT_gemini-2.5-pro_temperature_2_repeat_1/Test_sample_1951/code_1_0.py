  """
  Analyzes the provided statements about attack graphs and identifies the incorrect one.

  - A: Correct. Both SEG (state-space explosion) and LAG (often based on NP-complete problems like SAT) have exponential worst-case time complexity for generation.
  - B: Correct. SEGs can model non-monotonic scenarios (e.g., revoking a privilege) that standard monotonic LAGs cannot represent.
  - C: Correct. The monotonicity assumption (privileges are never lost) is the key factor that prevents the state-space explosion in LAGs, making them much smaller than SEGs.
  - D: Incorrect. Methods exist to calculate probabilities in graphs with cycles for both SEGs (e.g., probabilistic model checking on Markov chains) and LAGs (e.g., using Dynamic Bayesian Networks). The claim that it "cannot" be done is false.
  - E: Correct. SEGs can handle negation by representing the full state, while standard LAGs cannot handle general negation because it breaks the monotonicity assumption.

  The incorrect statement is D.
