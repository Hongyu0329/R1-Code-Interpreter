    "This is a state feedback controller design problem known as pole placement. The goal is to find a feedback gain matrix `F` that moves the eigenvalues (poles) of the system to desired locations in the complex plane, which determines the stability and performance of the closed-loop system.\n\nThe given system has two state variables and two control inputs, making it a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system. Because the number of control inputs is not less than the number of states, the problem is underdetermined, which means there are infinitely many solutions for the matrix `F`.\n\nTo find one valid solution, we can simplify the problem by assuming a structure for `F`. I will assume the second control input is not used, which is equivalent to setting the second row of `F` to zeros. So, `F` will have the form `[[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`. This reduces the problem to a uniquely solvable single-input pole placement problem.\n\nThe procedure to find `f1` and `f2` is:\n1.  Derive the characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system matrix `A + BF`. The closed-loop system is `A_cl = A + BF = [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]]`. Its characteristic polynomial is `det(sI - A_cl) = s^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2)`.\n2.  The desired eigenvalues are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The corresponding desired characteristic polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n3.  By equating the coefficients of the two polynomials, we get a system of two linear equations: `1 - f1 - f2 = 2` and `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 = 2`.\n4.  Solving these equations yields `f1 = 1` and `f2 = -2`.\n\nTherefore, a valid feedback gain matrix is `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`.\n\nThe following Python code defines the matrices, calculates the final closed-loop system using this `F`, prints the full equation, and verifies that the eigenvalues of the resulting system are at the desired locations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates and verifies the state feedback gain F for a given LTI system.\n# The method used is pole placement, simplified for a MIMO system.\n\n# Define the system matrices A and B.\nA = np.array([[-1., 1.],\n              [1., 0.]])\n\nB = np.array([[1., 2.],\n              [1., 0.]])\n\n# Based on manual calculation, one possible feedback matrix F is:\nF = np.array([[1., -2.],\n              [0., 0.]])\n\n# Calculate the closed-loop system matrix A_cl = A + B*F.\nA_cl = A + B @ F\n\n# Calculate the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system to verify the result.\neigenvalues, _ = np.linalg.eig(A_cl)\n\n# Print the final results in a formatted equation.\nprint(\"The calculated state feedback gain matrix F is:\")\nprint(F)\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation A + B*F = A_cl is:\\n\")\n\n# Print the equation A + B * F = A_cl with each number\nprint(f\"   [ {A[0,0]:>5.2f}  {A[0,1]:>5.2f} ]   [ {B[0,0]:>5.2f}  {B[0,1]:>5.2f} ]   [ {F[0,0]:>5.2f}  {F[0,1]:>5.2f} ]   [ {A_cl[0,0]:>5.2f}  {A_cl[0,1]:>5.2f} ]\")\nprint(f\"   [ {A[1,0]:>5.2f}  {A[1,1]:>5.2f} ] + [ {B[1,0]:>5.2f}  {B[1,1]:>5.2f} ] * [ {F[1,0]:>5.2f}  {F[1,1]:>5.2f} ] = [ {A_cl[1,0]:>5.2f}  {A_cl[1,1]:>5.2f} ]\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Verification: Eigenvalues of the closed-loop system A + BF are:\")\n# Format the complex numbers for printing\n# Using np.sort to ensure consistent order for comparison\nsorted_eigenvalues = np.sort(eigenvalues)\nformatted_eigenvalues = [f\"{eig.real:.2f} + {eig.imag:.2f}j\" if eig.imag >= 0 else f\"{eig.real:.2f} - {-eig.imag:.2f}j\" for eig in sorted_eigenvalues]\nprint(formatted_eigenvalues)\n\n```\n<<<[[1.0, -2.0], [0.0, 0.0]]>>>"
