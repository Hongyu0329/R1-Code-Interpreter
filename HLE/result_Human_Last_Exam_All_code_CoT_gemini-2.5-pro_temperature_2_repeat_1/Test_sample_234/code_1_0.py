# The problem asks for the number of properties that must always be true for the set S.
# Based on mathematical analysis, these properties are:
# 1. Open
# 2. Dense
# 3. Trivial first singular homology group.
# All other properties (Closed, Connected, Compact, Connected complement) have counterexamples.

# The count of properties that must always be true is 3.
