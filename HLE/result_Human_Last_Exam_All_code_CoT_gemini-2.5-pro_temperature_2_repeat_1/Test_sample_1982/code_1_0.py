# Step 1: Define the given constants from the problem.
# l1 is given as (1 + 10^5)^5
# c1 is given as 10^4
l1_val = (1 + 10**5)**5
c1_val = 10**4

# Step 2: Use the derived formula to calculate u1.
# From the problem analysis, we found the relationship l1 = 1 + c1 * u1.
# Rearranging for u1 gives: u1 = (l1 - 1) / c1.
# We use integer division // as the result is expected to be an integer.
u1_val = (l1_val - 1) // c1_val

# Step 3: Print the values used in the final equation.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation we solve is u1 = (l1 - 1) / c1.
print("To find the control u1, we use the equation: u1 = (l1 - 1) / c1")
print(f"The value for l1 is: {l1_val}")
print(f"The value for c1 is: {c1_val}")
print(f"The calculated value for the control u1 is: {u1_val}")
