    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use a general topological formula for Feynman diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Equations:** We will use two fundamental equations that relate the properties of a connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   The loop formula: `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators), and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   The vertex formula: `n * V = 2 * I + E`, where `n` is the number of lines meeting at each vertex and `E` is the number of external lines.\n2.  **Define the Theory:** For a standard interacting scalar field theory, we'll assume a $\\phi^4$ interaction, which is the most common and stable case. In this theory, each vertex connects four lines, so `n = 4`.\n3.  **Set the Constraints:** The problem specifies a two-loop diagram, so we set `L = 2`.\n4.  **Solve for Vertices (V):** We will combine the equations and solve for the number of vertices, `V`, in terms of the number of external lines, `E`.\n5.  **Minimize V:** To find the minimum number of vertices, we will find the minimum possible value for `E`. The smallest number of external lines a diagram can have is zero (`E=0`), which corresponds to a vacuum diagram.\n6.  **Calculate the Result:** Using `E=0`, we will calculate the minimum value for `V`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in a scalar phi^4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define variables as symbols for symbolic manipulation\n    L, I, V, E, n = sympy.symbols('L I V E n')\n\n    # 1.
