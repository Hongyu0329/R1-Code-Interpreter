        "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat.",
        "This repeat is unstable in somatic cells, meaning its length tends to increase over time, which contributes to the disease's progression. This is called somatic instability.",
        "The expansion is thought to occur during DNA replication on the lagging strand, where the CTG repeat can form hairpin structures.",
        "LIG1 (DNA Ligase I) is the enzyme responsible for sealing the final gap between Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand synthesis.",
        "If LIG1 seals the DNA backbone while a hairpin structure is present, the hairpin becomes incorporated into the DNA, resulting in an expansion of the repeat tract.",
        "Studies on mouse models have shown that reducing or knocking out LIG1 activity delays the final ligation step.",
        "This delay provides a larger window of opportunity for other DNA repair enzymes (such as FEN1) to identify and correctly remove the hairpin structures before they can be permanently sealed into the DNA.",
        "As a result, the rate of CTG repeat expansion is significantly decreased in the absence of full LIG1 function.",
        "Therefore, knocking out LIG1 leads to reduced somatic instability of the CTG repeat."
