    # Let's outline the reasoning for Q_128 (where n=7).
    # A power subgroup is of the form G^k = {g^k | g in G}.
    # The group is G = Q_128, with presentation <x, y | x^64=1, y^2=x^32, y^-1*x*y=x^-1>.
    # The order of the cyclic subgroup <x> is 2^(n-1), which is 64.

    # For any odd k, the set G^k is equal to G itself.
    # This gives one distinct power subgroup.

    # Case 2: The exponent k is an even integer.
    # For any even k, the set G^k simplifies to a cyclic subgroup <x^d>,
    # where d is an even divisor of the order of <x> (which is 64).
    # The even divisors of 64 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.
    # Each of these divisors generates a distinct power subgroup:
    # G^2=<x^2>, G^4=<x^4>, G^8=<x^8>, G^16=<x^16>, G^32=<x^32>, G^64=<x^64>={e}.
    # The number of these subgroups is the number of even divisors of 64, which is 6.
    # In general, this number is n - 1.

    # The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases.
    total_power_subgroups = num_from_odd_k + num_from_even_k
    
    # As requested, we output the numbers in the final equation.
