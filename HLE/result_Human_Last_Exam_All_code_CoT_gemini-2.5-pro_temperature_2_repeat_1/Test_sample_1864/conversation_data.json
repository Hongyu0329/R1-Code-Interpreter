    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry experiment, I will calculate the requirements for the three most critical types of controls: unstained controls, single-stain compensation controls, and Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls. The Python script below will define your specific fluorophores, explain the purpose of each control category, and then sum the number of controls required for a robust experimental setup. It will print the full breakdown and the final equation leading to the total number.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_fluorophores = len(fluorophores)\n\n    # 1.
