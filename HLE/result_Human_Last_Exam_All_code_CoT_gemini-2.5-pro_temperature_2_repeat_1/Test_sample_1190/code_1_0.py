    Step-by-step analysis:
    
    1. Understanding RAR Function: The Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) is a transcription factor with a modular structure. This means it has distinct regions, or domains, responsible for different tasks. The two most important domains for this question are:
       - The DNA-Binding Domain (DBD), which recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences.
       - The Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD), which binds to retinoic acid (RA) and subsequently recruits other proteins to activate transcription.
    
    2. The Principle of Separation-of-Function: Because these domains are structurally and functionally distinct, a mutation in one domain should primarily affect its specific function. A mutation in the LBD is not expected to directly affect the function of the DBD, and vice-versa.

    3. Evaluating the Options:
       - A. 'RAR mutants with insertions at sites g and h disrupt transcriptional activation but retain DNA binding.' This is highly plausible. If sites 'g' and 'h' are in the LBD or a transactivation region, the mutations would interfere with ligand binding or the recruitment of co-activator proteins, thus disrupting transcriptional activation. However, since the DBD is separate and unaffected, the mutant protein would still be able to bind to DNA. This describes a classic "separation-of-function" phenotype.
       - B. 'Mutants c, d, and e demonstrate identical effects on RA binding, yet differ significantly in DNA binding ability.' While possible if the mutations are in the DBD, this option is less descriptive of the overall relationship between the domains.
       - C. 'Insertions at k and l lead to loss of RA binding and DNA binding...' This is unlikely unless the insertions cause a major disruption that misfolds the entire protein. Typically, a localized mutation does not abolish the function of two distinct domains.
       - D. 'All mutants that are defective in RA binding are also defective in both DNA binding and transcriptional activation...' This is incorrect. A protein can lose its ability to bind its ligand (RA) but retain its ability to bind DNA.
       - E. 'Mutants f through m uniformly exhibit enhanced RA binding...' It is highly improbable that multiple different mutations would all lead to an enhancement of function (gain-of-function).
       
    4. Conclusion: Option A provides the most accurate description of the relationship between RAR structure and function. It correctly illustrates the principle that DNA binding and transcriptional activation are separate functions that can be independently disrupted by mutations in their respective domains.
