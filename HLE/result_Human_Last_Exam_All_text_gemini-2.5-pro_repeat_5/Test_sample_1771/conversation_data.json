    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti`.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-` (meaning 'to track, trace, give a sign'). The Hittite and Latin cognates confirm this root.\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie-`. This is a present tense suffix. Verbs formed with this suffix typically become Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic.\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti`. This is the 3rd person singular present indicative ending.\n*   **Phonology:**\n    *   The `*h₂` is a laryngeal consonant. Its primary effect here is \"coloring\" the preceding `*e` vowel, turning it into an `*a` sound. Thus, `*seh₂g-` is phonetically realized as `*sāg-`.\n    *   The form is `*sāg-ie-ti`.\n\n**2. Derivation into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe apply the systematic sound changes that occurred as PIE evolved into Proto-Germanic.\n\n*   **Grimm's Law:** This is a chain shift affecting all PIE stop consonants. The relevant change here is that PIE voiced stops become voiceless stops.\n    *   PIE `*g` → PGmc `*k`.\n*   **Vowel Changes:**\n    *   As noted above, PIE `*eh₂` becomes PGmc `*ā`.\n*   **Suffix and Ending:**\n    *   The PIE `*-ie-` suffix becomes `*-ija-` in Proto-Germanic for Class 1 weak verbs.\n    *   The PIE `*-ti` ending becomes `*-þi` in Proto-Germanic (`*t` > `*þ` via Grimm's Law).\n*   **Putting it together:** The PIE stem `*sāg-ie-` becomes the PGmc stem `*sākija-`. The infinitive form, which is standard for citation, would be **`*sākijaną`**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish this form from the more common PGmc verb `*sōkijaną` ('to seek'), which derives from a different PIE formation (the causative `*seh₂g-éye-ti`), where `*ā` became `*ō`. The question specifically provides `*seh₂gieti`, which leads to `*sākijaną`.\n\n**3. Derivation into Old Norse (ON)**\n\nWe trace the development from PGmc `*sākijaną`.\n\n*   **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*j` in the `*-ijaną` suffix causes the preceding back vowel (`*ā`) to become a front vowel.\n    *   PGmc `*ā` (`/ɑː/`) → Pre-ON `*ǣ` (`/æː/`). In Old Norse, this is written as `æ`.\n*   **Consonant and Suffix Changes:**\n    *   The `*k` remains `k`.\n    *   The `*j` that caused the umlaut is then lost.\n    *   The infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a`.\n*   **Putting it together:** `*sākijaną` → `*sǣkjan` → **`sækja`**.\n\n**4. Derivation into Old English (OE)**\n\nWe trace the development from PGmc `*sākijaną` into West Germanic and then Old English.\n\n*   **I-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the `*j` causes i-umlaut on the root vowel.\n    *   PGmc `*ā` → OE `ǣ`.\n*   **Palatalization:** In Old English, the velar consonant `*k` became a palato-alveolar affricate (`/tʃ/`, written `c`) when it came before a front vowel. The new vowel `ǣ` is a front vowel.\n    *   `*k` → OE `c` (`/tʃ/`).\n*   **Suffix Changes:** The `*-ijan-` part of the suffix is lost, and the infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n*   **Putting it together:** `*sākijaną` → `*sǣkjan` → **`sǣcan`**.\n\n**5. Derivation into Old High German (OHG)**\n\nWe trace the development from PGmc `*sākijaną`.\n\n*   **High German Consonant Shift:** This is the most significant change. It affects voiceless stops. The relevant rule is that a post-vocalic `*k` becomes a voiceless velar fricative `hh` (`/xx/`).\n    *   PGmc `*k` → OHG `hh`.\n*   **Vowel Changes:** The `*j` would normally cause i-umlaut. However, in Old High German, the long vowel `*ā` was resistant to i-umlaut and generally remained `ā`. While the phonetic effect may have existed in some dialects, it was not typically represented in writing.\n    *   PGmc `*ā` → OHG `ā`.\n*   **Suffix Changes:** In OHG Class 1 weak verbs, the `*j` is dropped after a heavy syllable (like one with a long vowel). The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` (often written `-en`).\n*   **Putting it together:** `*sākijaną` → `*sāhhan` → **`sāhhan`**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sākijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sækja`\n*   **Old English:** `sǣcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `sāhhan`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sākijaną; Old Norse: sækja; Old English: sǣcan; Old High German: sāhhan>>>"
