    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to find the specific US city where the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n2.  **Identify Key Entities:**\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (1997), directed by Paolo Virzì.\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso.\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci.\n    *   **Plot Point:** Tommaso, the wealthy best friend of the protagonist Piero, feels constrained by life in their hometown of Livorno and decides to move to the United States.\n3.  **Research the Plot:** To find the specific city, we need to consult plot summaries or detailed analyses of the film.\n4.  **Confirm the Character's Journey:** In the film's narrative, Tommaso's departure for America is a significant event that highlights the contrast between his path and that of his friend Piero, who stays in Livorno. Tommaso communicates his experiences in the US through letters sent back to Piero.\n5.  **Pinpoint the Destination:** A review of detailed plot summaries and film databases reveals that the letters Tommaso sends to Piero are postmarked from a specific city. This city is explicitly mentioned as his new home. By checking these sources, we can confirm the location.\n6.  **Synthesize the Information:** The character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, leaves Livorno to escape provincial life and moves to the United States. The city he relocates to is **Philadelphia**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Character Distinction:** It's important not to confuse the character in question, Tommaso, with the film's protagonist, Piero Mansani (played by Edoardo Gabbriellini). It is Tommaso who moves to the US, while Piero remains in Italy.\n*   **Source Verification:** The information should be verified from reliable film databases (like IMDb), detailed movie reviews, or encyclopedic entries about the film to ensure accuracy.\n*   **Actor-Character Match:** Confirm that Marco Cocci indeed played Tommaso. A check of the film's cast list confirms this is correct.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
