    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. Let `F` be the family of lines `L_{p,q}` with equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nThe condition that `K` intersects every line in `F` means that for every line `L_{p,q} \\in F`, there is at least one point `(x, y) \\in K` that lies on the line.\n\nA line with equation `f(x, y) = c` intersects a convex set `K` if and only if the set of values of `f(x, y)` for `(x, y) \\in K` includes `c`. That is:\n`inf_{(x,y) \\in K} f(x, y) \\le c \\le sup_{(x,y) \\in K} f(x, y)`\n\nFor our problem, `f(x, y) = px + qy` and `c = 1`. So, for any pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, the convex domain `K` must satisfy:\n`inf_{(x,y) \\in K} (px + qy) \\le 1 \\le sup_{(x,y) \\in K} (px + qy)`\n\n### Step 2: Deriving Constraints on the Domain's Dimensions\n\nWe can deduce constraints on the size of `K` by considering specific lines from the family `F`.\n\n1.  **Line `x = 1`**: This corresponds to `p=1, q=0`. Since `gcd(1, 0) = 1`, this line is in `F`. The condition is `inf_K(x) \\le 1 \\le sup_K(x)`. This implies `sup_K(x) \\ge 1`.\n\n2.  **Line `x = -1`**: This corresponds to `p=-1, q=0`. Since `gcd(-1, 0) = 1`, this line is in `F`. The condition is `inf_K(-x) \\le 1 \\le sup_K(-x)`.\n    `sup_K(-x) = -inf_K(x)` and `inf_K(-x) = -sup_K(x)`.\n    So, `-sup_K(x) \\le 1 \\le -inf_K(x)`, which simplifies to `sup_K(x) \\ge -1` and `inf_K(x) \\le -1`.\n\n    Combining the results from lines `x=1` and `x=-1`, we must have `sup_K(x) \\ge 1` and `inf_K(x) \\le -1`.\n\n3.  **Width in the x-direction**: The width of a convex set `K` in a certain direction is the distance between two parallel supporting lines perpendicular to that direction. The width in the x-direction is `w_x = sup_K(x) - inf_K(x)`.\n    From our derived conditions, `w_x \\ge 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n4.  **Width in the y-direction**: By a similar argument using the lines `y = 1` (for `p=0, q=1`) and `y = -1` (for `p=0, q=-1`), we can conclude that the width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y`, must also satisfy `w_y \\ge 2`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for the Area\n\nThere is a well-known result in geometry relating the area of a convex set to its widths in two orthogonal directions. For any convex set `K` in the plane with area `A`, and widths `w_x` and `w_y` in the x and y directions, the following inequality holds:\n`A \\ge \\frac{1}{2} w_x w_y`\n\nUsing the minimum widths we found in Step 2 (`w_x \\ge 2` and `w_y \\ge 2`), we can find a lower bound for the area of `K`:\n`A \\ge \\frac{1}{2} (2)(2) = 2`\n\nThis proves that any convex domain satisfying the given conditions must have an area of at least 2.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Candidate Domain and Verifying It\n\nNow we need to see if this minimum area of 2 can be achieved. Let's propose a candidate domain and check if it satisfies all the conditions.\n\nConsider the square `D` with vertices at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(-1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`.\n*   **Convexity**: This square is a convex set.\n*   **Area**: The diagonals have length 2. The area is `(1/2) * d_1 * d_2 = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\nNow, we must verify that this square `D` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`. We check the condition from Step 1: `inf_D(px + qy) \\le 1 \\le sup_D(px + qy)`.\n\nFor a convex polygon, the infimum and supremum of a linear function `px + qy` are always achieved at its vertices. We evaluate `px + qy` at the four vertices of `D`:\n*   At `(1, 0)`: `p(1) + q(0) = p`\n*   At `(0, 1)`: `p(0) + q(1) = q`\n*   At `(-1, 0)`: `p(-1) + q(0) = -p`\n*   At `(0, -1)`: `p(0) + q(-1) = -q`\n\nSo, for any `(x, y) \\in D`, the value of `px + qy` lies between the minimum and maximum of `{p, q, -p, -q}`.\n*   `sup_D(px + qy) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`\n*   `inf_D(px + qy) = min(p, q, -p, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`\n\nThe condition becomes `-max(|p|, |q|) \\le 1 \\le max(|p|, |q|)`. This is equivalent to the single condition `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1`.\n\nWe need to check if this is true for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\nThe condition `gcd(p, q) = 1` means that `p` and `q` are not both zero.\n*   If `p=0`, then `gcd(0, q) = |q| = 1`. So `q` must be `1` or `-1`. In this case, `max(|p|, |q|) = max(0, 1) = 1`. The condition holds.\n*   If `q=0`, then `gcd(p, 0) = |p| = 1`. So `p` must be `1` or `-1`. In this case, `max(|p|, |q|) = max(1, 0) = 1`. The condition holds.\n*   If neither `p` nor `q` is zero, they are non-zero integers. Thus, `|p| \\ge 1` and `|q| \\ge 1`, which means `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1`. The condition holds.\n\nSince the condition `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1` holds for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`, the square `D` intersects all the required lines.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  The area of any such convex domain must be at least 2.\n2.  We have constructed a specific convex domain (the square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`) which has an area of exactly 2 and satisfies all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
