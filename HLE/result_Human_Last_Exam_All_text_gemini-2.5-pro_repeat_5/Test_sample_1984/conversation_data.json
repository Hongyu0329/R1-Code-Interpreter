    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions of the differential equation, which occur when $x'(t) = 0$. Let $x$ be an equilibrium point. Then we must solve the equation:\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parentheses is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points. They are:\n$$ x = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 1 $$\nSo, we have two equilibrium points: $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of the equilibrium points, we can analyze the sign of the function $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$ around each point. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if trajectories starting near $x^*$ move towards $x^*$. It is unstable if they move away from $x^*$.\n\nLet's use the first derivative test. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. The stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by the sign of $f'(x^*)$:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$**:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$**:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), the term $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = (-)(+) = -$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases and moves towards 1.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), the term $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = (-)(+) = -$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases and moves away from 1.\n\n    Since trajectories starting from one side of $x=1$ (i.e., $x < 1$) move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. Such a point is called semi-stable, which is a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\n\nFrom our analysis in Step 2, we found that there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, is:\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final value**\n\nThe question asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m = 1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The equilibrium points are the roots of $-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = -x(x-1)^2 = 0$, which are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n2.  The stability is determined by analyzing the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ or its derivative $f'(x) = -3x^2+4x-1$.\n3.  At $x=0$, $f'(0)=-1 < 0$, so it is a stable equilibrium.\n4.  At $x=1$, $f'(1)=0$. An analysis of the sign of $f(x)$ shows that for $x$ near 1, $f(x) < 0$. This means solutions starting at $x>1$ approach 1, but solutions starting at $x<1$ move away from 1. Thus, $x=1$ is an unstable (semi-stable) equilibrium.\n5.  The number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n6.  The expression to be found is $m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
