    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific person based on a set of clues. Let's break down these clues:\n    *   **Who:** A physicist.\n    *   **Known for:** Primarily for work in the field of microscopy.\n    *   **Discovered:** An optical effect related to real imagery.\n    *   **Circumstances of Discovery:** The effect was first accidentally observed by a custodial worker.\n    *   **Apparatus:** The observation was made while the worker was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **List Careful Points:**\n    *   The physicist must be more famous for microscopy than for this specific optical effect. This helps narrow down the candidates. For example, a physicist known primarily for discovering the effect itself might not be the correct answer if they have no significant connection to microscopy.\n    *   The anecdote about the custodial worker is a very specific and key piece of historical information. It's the most unique clue to follow.\n    *   The effect involves \"real imagery\" and \"concave mirrors.\" Concave mirrors are capable of forming real, inverted images at a focal point, which is where this effect would have been observed. The effect itself is a visualization of transparent phenomena (like air currents).\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer through Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Following the Anecdote:** The story of an optical effect being discovered by a cleaner or janitor is a specific historical event. Research into this anecdote points to an incident at the University of Giessen in Germany around the turn of the 20th century.\n    *   **The Observation:** A custodial worker (sometimes identified as Mr. Schlosser) was polishing a large, concave searchlight mirror. When he breathed on the mirror, he noticed strange, shimmering patterns in the air in front of it. He was seeing a real image of the disturbances (the warm, moist air from his breath) in the air, an effect known as a Schlieren phenomenon.\n    *   **Connecting to the Physicist:** The worker reported this strange observation. The story was passed to the physicist **August Köhler**, who was a colleague of Wilhelm Röntgen at the university.\n    *   **Verifying the Clues for August Köhler:**\n        *   **Physicist?** Yes, August Köhler (1866–1948) was a German physicist.\n        *   **Better known for work in microscopy?** Absolutely. Köhler is a giant in the history of microscopy. He is the inventor of \"Köhler illumination\" (developed in 1893), a fundamental principle for illuminating specimens that is still taught and used universally in modern light microscopy to achieve the best possible resolution and contrast.\n        *   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery?** While others like Robert Hooke and August Toepler had worked on Schlieren phenomena before, Köhler investigated this specific observation, understood the optics behind it, and published a method for what he called \"shadow projection\" (Schattenprojektion), which was essentially a form of Schlieren imaging. The shimmering patterns seen were part of the real image formed by the concave mirror.\n        *   **Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?** This perfectly matches the historical account associated with Köhler's work on the subject. He explicitly credited the custodial worker for the initial observation.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** August Köhler is the physicist who is far more famous for his foundational work in microscopy (Köhler illumination) but is also credited with investigating and explaining an optical effect (Schlieren) that was first brought to his attention by a custodial worker cleaning a concave mirror.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<August Köhler>>>"
