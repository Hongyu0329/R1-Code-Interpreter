    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ and the following non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nWe can see that $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra. The lower central series is:\n$\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_3]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^4 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^3] = \\{0\\}$\nSince the series terminates at $\\{0\\}$, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent.\n\nThe algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be viewed as a semi-direct product. Let $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ and let $\\mathfrak{n} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$. The subspace $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an ideal in $\\mathfrak{g}$ since $[\\mathfrak{h}, \\mathfrak{n}] \\subset \\mathfrak{n}$. The brackets within $\\mathfrak{n}$ are all zero, so $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an abelian ideal, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\nThus, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\rtimes_\\phi \\mathfrak{n} \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^5$. The action $\\phi: \\mathfrak{h} \\to \\text{Der}(\\mathfrak{n})$ is given by the adjoint action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{n}$. Let $D = \\text{ad}(e_1)|_{\\mathfrak{n}}$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the formula for the cohomology of a semi-direct product $\\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{n}$**\n\nFor a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{n}$, where $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an ideal, its cohomology is related to the cohomology of the complex of invariants of $\\mathfrak{n}$ under the action of $\\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $D$ be the derivation on $\\mathfrak{n}$ defining the action. The derivation $D$ extends to the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)$. The subcomplex of invariants is $(\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)^D, d_\\mathfrak{n})$, where $d_\\mathfrak{n}$ is the differential of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{n}$.\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is given by the formula:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x) P_{(\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)^D, d_\\mathfrak{n})}(x)$.\n\nIn our case, $\\mathfrak{n}$ is abelian, so its differential $d_\\mathfrak{n}$ is zero. The cohomology of the invariant subcomplex is just the space of invariants itself. The Poincaré polynomial is therefore:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x) P_{\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)^D}(x)$,\nwhere $P_{\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)^D}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^5 \\dim((\\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{n}^*))^D) x^k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the derivation D and find the invariants**\n\nThe action of $D = \\text{ad}(e_1)$ on the basis of $\\mathfrak{n}$ is:\n$D(e_2) = e_3$, $D(e_3) = e_4$, $D(e_4) = 0$\n$D(e_5) = e_6$, $D(e_6) = 0$\n\nLet $\\{\\omega_2, \\ldots, \\omega_6\\}$ be the dual basis for $\\mathfrak{n}^*$. The action on $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ is given by the derivation, which we will also denote by $D$, corresponding to the matrix $-(\\text{ad}(e_1)|_\\mathfrak{n})^T$.\n$D(\\omega_2) = -\\omega_3$, $D(\\omega_3) = -\\omega_4$, $D(\\omega_4) = 0$\n$D(\\omega_5) = -\\omega_6$, $D(\\omega_6) = 0$\n(Note: The sign does not affect the space of invariants since $D(\\alpha)=0 \\iff -D(\\alpha)=0$.) Let's ignore the sign for simplicity in finding the kernel.\nLet $D_1$ be the derivation on $A = \\Lambda(\\omega_2, \\omega_3, \\omega_4)$ sending $\\omega_2 \\to \\omega_3 \\to \\omega_4 \\to 0$.\nLet $D_2$ be the derivation on $B = \\Lambda(\\omega_5, \\omega_6)$ sending $\\omega_5 \\to \\omega_6 \\to 0$.\nThe total derivation is $D = D_1 + D_2$ on $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*) = A \\otimes B$. Since $D_1$ and $D_2$ are nilpotent derivations acting on algebras over a field of characteristic 0, the space of invariants of the sum is the tensor product of the spaces of invariants:\n$(\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*))^D = A^{D_1} \\otimes B^{D_2}$.\nTherefore, the Poincaré polynomial of the invariants is the product of the Poincaré polynomials of the two invariant subalgebras:\n$P_{\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)^D}(x) = P_{A^{D_1}}(x) \\cdot P_{B^{D_2}}(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Poincaré polynomials of the invariant subalgebras**\n\n*   **Invariants in $A = \\Lambda(\\omega_2, \\omega_3, \\omega_4)$ under $D_1$:**\n    *   Degree 0: $1$ is invariant.\n    *   Degree 1: An element $c_2\\omega_2+c_3\\omega_3+c_4\\omega_4$ is invariant if $c_2\\omega_3+c_3\\omega_4=0$, which implies $c_2=c_3=0$. The invariant is $\\omega_4$.\n    *   Degree 2: An element $c_{23}\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_3 + c_{24}\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_4 + c_{34}\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_4$ is invariant if $c_{23}\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_4 + c_{24}\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_4=0$, implying $c_{23}=c_{24}=0$. The invariant is $\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_4$.\n    *   Degree 3: $D_1(\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_4) = 0$. The invariant is $\\omega_2\\wedge\\omega_3\\wedge\\omega_4$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial for $A^{D_1}$ is $P_{A^{D_1}}(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3$.\n\n*   **Invariants in $B = \\Lambda(\\omega_5, \\omega_6)$ under $D_2$:**\n    *   Degree 0: $1$ is invariant.\n    *   Degree 1: An element $c_5\\omega_5+c_6\\omega_6$ is invariant if $c_5\\omega_6=0$, implying $c_5=0$. The invariant is $\\omega_6$.\n    *   Degree 2: $D_2(\\omega_5\\wedge\\omega_6)=0$. The invariant is $\\omega_5\\wedge\\omega_6$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial for $B^{D_2}$ is $P_{B^{D_2}}(x) = 1 + x + x^2$.\n\n*   **Total polynomial of invariants:**\n    $P_{\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)^D}(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x+x^2)$\n    $ = (1+x+x^2) + x(1+x+x^2) + x^2(1+x+x^2) + x^3(1+x+x^2)$\n    $ = 1+x+x^2 + x+x^2+x^3 + x^2+x^3+x^4 + x^3+x^4+x^5$\n    $ = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x) P_{\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)^D}(x)$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$\n$ = (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + 3x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\n$ = 1 + (2+1)x + (3+2)x^2 + (3+3)x^3 + (2+3)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + x^6$\n$ = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nFinal answer is the polynomial obtained.\n\nFinal check of the steps.\n1. Identification of the structure as $\\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^5$ is correct.\n2. The formula for the Poincaré polynomial of such a semi-direct product is correct.\n3. The calculation of the action of the derivation $D$ is correct.\n4. The theorem on the invariants of a tensor product under a sum of nilpotent derivations is a known result.\n5. The calculation of the invariants for the two sub-problems is correct.\n6. The final polynomial multiplication is correct.\nThe method and calculations are sound.\n\nFinal polynomial: $1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
