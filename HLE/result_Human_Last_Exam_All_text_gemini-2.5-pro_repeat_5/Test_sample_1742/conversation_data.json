    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Terminology\n\n1.  **Path Algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$**: This is the algebra associated with the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. It is a finite-dimensional, associative, hereditary algebra. The number of non-isomorphic simple modules is $n=3$, corresponding to the three vertices.\n\n2.  **Indecomposable Modules**: Since $A$ is of finite representation type (Dynkin type $A_3$), there are a finite number of indecomposable modules. There are $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{3(4)}{2} = 6$ such modules. We can denote them by their dimension vectors $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$:\n    *   $S_1 = (1,0,0)$: Simple module at vertex 1. This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n    *   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$: Simple module at vertex 2.\n    *   $S_3 = (0,0,1)$: Simple module at vertex 3. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n    *   $I_2 = (1,1,0)$: Injective module at vertex 2.\n    *   $P_2 = (0,1,1)$: Projective module at vertex 2.\n    *   $P_1 = (1,1,1)$: Projective module at vertex 1. This is also the injective module $I_3$.\n\n3.  **$\\tau$-tilting Module**: For a hereditary algebra like $A$, the concepts of $\\tau$-tilting modules and tilting modules coincide. A tilting module $T$ is an $A$-module satisfying:\n    a.  $T$ is the direct sum of $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable modules, i.e., $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$.\n    b.  $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T, T) = 0$. This is equivalent to $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all pairs of summands $T_i, T_j$.\n\n4.  **Slice Module**: For a hereditary algebra of finite representation type, a slice module is a tilting module that is also **sincere**. A module is sincere if every simple module appears as a composition factor in its Jordan-HÃ¶lder series. This is equivalent to saying that its support includes all vertices of the quiver. A module that is not sincere is sometimes called a non-sincere or partial module.\n\nThe question asks for the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice. Based on the definitions above, we are looking for the unique **non-sincere tilting module**.\n\n### Step 2: Find all Tilting Modules\n\nTo find all tilting modules, we need to find all sets of 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable modules $\\{T_1, T_2, T_3\\}$ such that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n\nWe can compute the $\\text{Ext}^1$ groups. A key property for the path algebra of $Q: 1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is:\n*   $\\text{Ext}^1_A(S_{i+1}, S_i) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$ for $i=1,2$.\n*   $\\text{Ext}^1_A(P, M) = 0$ for any projective module $P$ and any module $M$.\n*   $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M, I) = 0$ for any injective module $I$ and any module $M$.\n\nLet's list the modules and their properties:\n*   Projectives: $P_1, P_2, S_3$.\n*   Injectives: $S_1, I_2, P_1$.\n*   Regular: $S_2$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all pairs defines a compatibility relation. We are looking for a maximal set of compatible indecomposable modules. The number of tilting modules over the path algebra of type $A_n$ is the $n$-th Catalan number $C_n = \\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}$. For $n=3$, we have $C_3 = \\frac{1}{4}\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{20}{4} = 5$. So there are 5 tilting modules.\n\nThe five tilting modules for $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ are:\n1.  $T_1 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$ (The projective generator)\n2.  $T_2 = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$ (The injective cogenerator)\n3.  $T_3 = S_1 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus P_1$\n4.  $T_4 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$\n5.  $T_5 = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$\n\n### Step 3: Check Sincerity for Each Tilting Module\n\nNow we check which of these 5 tilting modules are sincere. A module is sincere if all simple modules $S_1, S_2, S_3$ are among its composition factors.\n\n1.  **$T_1 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$**:\n    *   $P_1=(1,1,1)$ has composition factors $S_1, S_2, S_3$.\n    *   The module $T_1$ is sincere due to the summand $P_1$.\n\n2.  **$T_2 = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$**:\n    *   $P_1=(1,1,1)$ has composition factors $S_1, S_2, S_3$.\n    *   The module $T_2$ is sincere due to the summand $P_1$.\n\n3.  **$T_3 = S_1 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus P_1$**:\n    *   $P_1=(1,1,1)$ has composition factors $S_1, S_2, S_3$.\n    *   The module $T_3$ is sincere due to the summand $P_1$.\n\n4.  **$T_4 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$**:\n    *   $P_1=(1,1,1)$ has composition factors $S_1, S_2, S_3$.\n    *   The module $T_4$ is sincere due to the summand $P_1$.\n\n5.  **$T_5 = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$**:\n    *   $S_1=(1,0,0)$. Composition factors: $\\{S_1\\}$.\n    *   $I_2=(1,1,0)$. Composition factors: $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$.\n    *   $S_2=(0,1,0)$. Composition factors: $\\{S_2\\}$.\n    *   The composition factors of $T_5$ are $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$. The simple module $S_3$ is not a composition factor.\n    *   Therefore, $T_5$ is **not sincere**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nWe have found that there are five tilting modules (which are the $\\tau$-tilting modules for this algebra). Four of them are sincere (and therefore are slice modules), and exactly one is not sincere. This non-sincere module is the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice.\n\nThe unique non-sincere tilting module is $T_5 = S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$.\n\nFinal Answer Format: The question asks for the module itself.\n\n$S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$\n\n<<<S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2>>>"
