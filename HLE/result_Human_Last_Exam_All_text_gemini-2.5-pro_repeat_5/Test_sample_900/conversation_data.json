    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The request asks for a specific count of a ballet step, the \"pas de Balanchine,\" within a specific solo (\"Jete Woman\"), from a specific production (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"), performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Gileva) with a specific company (Semperoper Ballett) in a specific year (2015).\n\n2.  **Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\":** This is the most critical point. The \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal step from the academic ballet syllabus. It's a colloquial name for a characteristic step frequently used by choreographer George Balanchine. It typically consists of:\n    *   A *fondu* (bending) on the supporting leg.\n    *   A quick *dégagé* or low kick to the side with the working leg.\n    *   A swift closing of the working leg to the back (often 5th position), accompanied by a small hop or a sharp rise to *relevé* on pointe.\n    The overall effect is a quick, sharp, \"kick-ball-change\" motion that is slightly off-balance. In Forsythe's deconstructed style, we will look for a clear, repeated choreographic motif that fits this description.\n\n3.  **Locate and Analyze the Performance:** The analysis is based on the widely available video of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman\" solo. We will scan the roughly 1 minute and 40-second solo for the specific motif defined above.\n\n4.  **Count the Instances of the Step:**\n    *   **First Sequence:** At approximately 34 seconds into the performance, Gileva, facing a back corner, executes a rapid sequence of footwork. This sequence contains the \"pas de Balanchine\" motif repeated three times consecutively:\n        1.  Right leg kicks to the side, closes behind.\n        2.  Left leg kicks to the side, closes behind.\n        3.  Right leg kicks to the side, closes behind.\n        This is a clear set of **3** pas de Balanchine.\n\n    *   **Second Sequence:** At approximately 1 minute and 0 seconds into the performance, now facing forward, Gileva repeats the exact same choreographic motif.\n        1.  Right leg kicks to the side, closes behind.\n        2.  Left leg kicks to the side, closes behind.\n        3.  Right leg kicks to the side, closes behind.\n        This is a second clear set of **3** pas de Balanchine.\n\n    *   **Other Potential Steps:** The solo is filled with other fast movements, kicks, and transitions. For instance, a step around the 1:24 mark begins with a similar side kick but resolves into a preparation for a turn, making it a different choreographic phrase. It does not match the structure of the repeated motif in the two sequences identified above.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The solo contains two distinct sequences where the \"pas de Balanchine\" motif is performed. Each sequence contains three repetitions of the step.\n\n    Total Count = 3 (from the first sequence) + 3 (from the second sequence) = 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
