    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of colours required for a proper colouring of a graph $G$. Let's break down the given information:\n*   **Graph G**: A collection of vertices and edges.\n*   **Number of vertices**: $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n*   **Proper colouring**: Assigning colours to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.\n*   **Chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$**: The minimum number of colours needed for a proper colouring of $G$.\n*   **Constraint**: The graph $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_n$). A complete graph $K_n$ is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   **Objective**: Find the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ for any graph $G$ that satisfies these conditions. This can be written as finding $\\max \\{\\chi(G) : |V(G)| = 12345 \\text{ and } G \\neq K_{12345}\\}$.\n\nThe mention of \"maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\" is a standard property of a graph. It might hint towards using graph theory theorems related to degree, like Brooks' Theorem, but as we will see, a more direct approach is sufficient.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\nWe need to find an upper limit on the number of colours for any graph that is not complete.\n\n*   A fundamental result in graph theory states that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n*   **Reasoning**: If $\\chi(G) = n$, it means that in any proper colouring using the minimum number of colours, all $n$ vertices must receive a distinct colour. If any two vertices could be coloured the same, we would need at most $n-1$ colours. For any two vertices to require different colours, they must be adjacent. Since this must hold for all pairs of vertices, the graph must be a complete graph.\n*   The problem explicitly states that $G$ is **not** a complete graph.\n*   Therefore, $\\chi(G)$ cannot be equal to $n$. This implies that $\\chi(G) < n$.\n*   Since the chromatic number must be an integer, the maximum possible value is $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n*   For our specific case, with $n = 12345$, we have established an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that this Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow we must demonstrate that there exists at least one graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344. If we can find such a graph, we will have proven that 12344 is the maximum possible value.\n\n*   **Construction**: Let's construct a graph $G_0$ by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge. Let the vertices be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{12345}\\}$, and let the removed edge be $(v_{12344}, v_{12345})$.\n*   **Verification**: This graph $G_0 = K_{12345} - e$ has 12345 vertices and is not a complete graph because the edge $(v_{12344}, v_{12345})$ is missing.\n\n*   **Calculating the Chromatic Number of $G_0$**:\n    1.  **Lower Bound**: A key property is that the chromatic number of any graph is always greater than or equal to the size of its largest clique (a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent). This is denoted as $\\chi(G) \\ge \\omega(G)$.\n        *   Let's find the size of the largest clique in our constructed graph $G_0$. Consider the set of vertices $C = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{12343}, v_{12344}\\}$.\n        *   In this set $C$, any pair of vertices from $\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_{12343}\\}$ is adjacent (since they are part of the original complete graph).\n        *   Also, the vertex $v_{12344}$ is adjacent to all vertices $\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_{12343}\\}$ (since the only edge removed involved $v_{12345}$).\n        *   Therefore, the set $C$ is a clique of size $12343 + 1 = 12344$.\n        *   This means $\\omega(G_0) = 12344$.\n        *   From the property $\\chi(G_0) \\ge \\omega(G_0)$, we get $\\chi(G_0) \\ge 12344$.\n\n    2.  **Upper Bound**: We already know from Step 2 that since $G_0$ is not a complete graph, $\\chi(G_0) \\le 12344$. We can also show this directly by providing a valid colouring with 12344 colours.\n        *   Let's colour the vertices of $G_0$. The vertices $v_{12344}$ and $v_{12345}$ are not adjacent, so we can assign them the same colour, say Colour 1.\n        *   The remaining $12345 - 2 = 12343$ vertices, $\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_{12343}\\}$, form a clique ($K_{12343}$). Furthermore, each of these vertices is adjacent to both $v_{12344}$ and $v_{12345}$.\n        *   This means that each of the vertices $\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_{12343}\\}$ must have a colour different from Colour 1, and they must all have different colours from each other.\n        *   So, we need $12343$ new, distinct colours for these vertices. Let's use Colours 2, 3, ..., 12344.\n        *   The total number of colours used is $1$ (for $v_{12344}$ and $v_{12345}$) + $12343$ (for the rest) = $12344$.\n        *   This demonstrates a proper colouring with 12344 colours, so $\\chi(G_0) \\le 12344$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for $G_0$**: Since we have shown $\\chi(G_0) \\ge 12344$ and $\\chi(G_0) \\le 12344$, we can conclude that $\\chi(G_0) = 12344$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  For any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, the number of colours needed is at most 12344.\n2.  There exists at least one such graph (namely, $K_{12345}$ with one edge removed) that requires exactly 12344 colours.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colours needed is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
