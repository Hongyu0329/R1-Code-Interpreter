    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen solid aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, it dissolves and participates in two main equilibrium reactions:\n*   **Dissolution:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n*   **Complexation:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion (Al(OH)4⁻).\n*   **Water Autoionization:** Water itself establishes an equilibrium between H⁺ and OH⁻ ions.\n\nThe corresponding chemical equations and equilibrium constants are:\n1.  **Dissolution (K_sp):**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Complex Formation (K_f):**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\n3.  **Water Autoionization (K_w):**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**2. Define Solubility (S)**\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Establish a System of Equations**\n\nTo find the solubility, we need to solve for the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved. We can establish a system of equations based on the equilibria and the principle of charge neutrality.\n\n*   From the K_sp expression: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   From the K_f expression: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × [Al³⁺] × [OH⁻]⁴\n    *   Substituting the expression for [Al³⁺], we get:\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) × [OH⁻]⁴ = (K_sp × K_f) × [OH⁻]\n*   From the K_w expression: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n*   **Charge Balance Equation:** The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**4. Solve the System of Equations for [OH⁻]**\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for [Al³⁺], [Al(OH)₄⁻], and [H⁺] into the charge balance equation. This will give us a single equation with one unknown, [OH⁻].\n\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻])\n\nTo solve this equation, we can multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³ to eliminate the denominators:\n3K_sp + K_w[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_sp × K_f)[OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearranging the terms to form a standard polynomial equation:\n(1 + K_sp × K_f)[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w[OH⁻]² - 3K_sp = 0\n\nThis is a quartic equation, but it can be treated as a quadratic equation by letting z = [OH⁻]².\n(1 + K_sp × K_f)z² - K_w z - 3K_sp = 0\n\n**5. Calculate the Value of [OH⁻]**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the coefficient values:\n*   a = (1 + K_sp × K_f) = 1 + (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷)(1.1 × 10³¹) = 1 + 5.83 × 10⁴ ≈ 5.83 × 10⁴\n*   b = -K_w = -1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n*   c = -3K_sp = -3 × (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) = -1.59 × 10⁻²⁶\n\nNow, we use the quadratic formula to solve for z:\nz = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a\nz = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ± √((-1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83 × 10⁴)(-1.59 × 10⁻²⁶))] / (2 × 5.83 × 10⁴)\nz = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ± √(1.0 × 10⁻²⁸ + 3.707 × 10⁻²¹)] / (1.166 × 10⁵)\nz = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ± √(3.707 × 10⁻²¹)] / (1.166 × 10⁵)\nz = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.089 × 10⁻¹¹] / (1.166 × 10⁵)\n\nSince z = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\nz = (6.090 × 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 × 10⁵) = 5.223 × 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow we find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = √z = √(5.223 × 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentrations of Aluminum Species**\n\nWith the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can now find the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 × 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.44 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp × K_f) × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.285 × 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**7. Calculate the Total Solubility (S)**\n\nFinally, we calculate the total molar solubility by summing the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.44 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000444 + 0.00133\nS = 0.001774 mol L⁻¹\nS = 1.774 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\nS = 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
