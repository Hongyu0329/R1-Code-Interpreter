    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function $f$.**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted as $|S|$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    The given equation implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$.\n    Since the exponential function $g(x) = e^x$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ is an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:**\n    A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Range of $f$:**\n    The range of the function $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\n    Let $R(f)$ be the range of $f$. The equation means that for any $y \\in R(f)$, $f(y)$ must be in the range of $e^x$, so $f(y) > 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine if $f$ can be strictly decreasing.**\n\nAssume $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n- If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.\n- Applying the decreasing function $f$ again, we get $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$.\n- This means $e^{x_1} < e^{x_2}$, which is true since $e^x$ is an increasing function. So, this initial check doesn't rule out the decreasing case.\n\nLet's analyze the limits of $f$:\n- As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach some limit $L$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $L$ can be finite or $-\\infty$.\n  - $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} e^x = \\infty$.\n  - If $L$ were finite, then by continuity, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = f(L)$, which must be $\\infty$. This is a contradiction.\n  - Thus, we must have $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n- As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ must approach a limit $M$. Since $f$ is decreasing and bounded below by its own range (on which $f$ acts), $M$ must be finite or $\\infty$.\n  - $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} e^x = 0$.\n  - If $M = \\infty$, then $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$. This contradicts the fact that the limit is 0.\n  - Therefore, $M$ must be a finite number.\n- So we have $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$. By continuity of $f$, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = f(\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)) = f(M)$.\n- So, we must have $f(M) = 0$.\n- Now let's use the main equation:\n  - $f(f(M)) = e^M \\implies f(0) = e^M$.\n  - $f(f(0)) = e^0 \\implies f(e^M) = 1$.\n- We have established that $f$ is a strictly decreasing function. Let's check for consistency:\n  - We have $f(M) = 0$ and $f(0) = e^M$. Since $e^M > 0$, we have $f(0) > f(M)$. As $f$ is decreasing, this implies $0 < M$.\n  - We have $f(M) = 0$ and $f(e^M) = 1$. Since $1 > 0$, we have $f(e^M) > f(M)$. As $f$ is decreasing, this implies $e^M < M$.\n- The condition is that there exists a real number $M > 0$ such that $e^M < M$. Let's analyze the function $g(x) = x - e^x$. We need $g(M) > 0$.\n- The derivative is $g'(x) = 1 - e^x$. For $x>0$, $g'(x) < 0$, so $g(x)$ is strictly decreasing for $x>0$.\n- The value at $x=0$ is $g(0) = 0 - e^0 = -1$.\n- Since $g(x)$ is decreasing for $x>0$, for any $M>0$, we have $g(M) < g(0) = -1$.\n- This means $M - e^M < -1$, which implies $M < e^M$. The condition $e^M < M$ can never be satisfied.\n- Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude that $f$ must be strictly increasing and construct the solutions.**\n\nSince $f$ must be monotonic and cannot be decreasing, $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n\nThe construction of such a function $f$ is quite involved, but it hinges on defining the function on a specific interval and then extending it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the given functional equation.\n\n1.  **Define a parameter $\\alpha$:** Let $f(0) = \\alpha$.\n    -   $f(f(0)) = e^0 \\implies f(\\alpha) = 1$.\n    -   $f(f(\\alpha)) = e^\\alpha \\implies f(1) = e^\\alpha$.\n    -   Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $0 < \\alpha \\implies f(0) < f(\\alpha) \\implies \\alpha < 1$.\n    -   Also, $\\alpha < 1 \\implies f(\\alpha) < f(1) \\implies 1 < e^\\alpha$. Taking $\\ln$ of both sides gives $0 < \\alpha$.\n    -   So, the value $\\alpha = f(0)$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$. Any choice of $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is a valid starting point. The set of possible values for $\\alpha$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **Define a \"seed\" function $h$:** For a chosen $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, we need to define $f$ on the interval $[0, \\alpha]$.\n    -   We know $f(0) = \\alpha$ and $f(\\alpha) = 1$.\n    -   Since $f$ must be continuous and strictly increasing, we can define $f(x) = h(x)$ for $x \\in [0, \\alpha]$, where $h: [0, \\alpha] \\to [\\alpha, 1]$ is any continuous, strictly increasing function (a homeomorphism) such that $h(0) = \\alpha$ and $h(\\alpha) = 1$.\n\n3.  **Count the number of choices for $h$:** How many such functions $h$ exist for a given $\\alpha$?\n    -   A continuous strictly increasing function from one interval to another is determined by its values on a dense set, like the rational numbers.\n    -   One can show that there is a continuum of choices for such a function $h$. For example, for any real number $p > 0$, the function $g_p(t) = t^p$ is a homeomorphism of $[0,1]$ to itself. We can rescale and shift this to get a family of valid functions $h$ on $[0, \\alpha]$. This already gives $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices.\n    -   A more detailed argument shows that the set of such functions $h$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n4.  **Extend the function:** Once $\\alpha$ and $h$ are chosen, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    -   For $x \\in (\\alpha, 1]$, $f(x)$ can be defined via $f(x) = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$.\n    -   For $x>1$, $f$ is defined using the property $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$, which can be derived from the original equation.\n    -   For $x<0$, $f$ is defined using $f(x) = f^{-1}(e^x)$.\n    -   This construction produces a valid continuous and strictly increasing function $f$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total cardinality.**\n\nThe set of solutions $S$ is the union of sets of solutions $S_\\alpha$ for each possible choice of $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$.\n$S = \\bigcup_{\\alpha \\in (0,1)} S_\\alpha$\n- For each $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, the choice of a function $h$ determines a unique solution $f \\in S_\\alpha$. Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $h$, we have $|S_\\alpha| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n- The sets $S_\\alpha$ are disjoint because functions from different sets will have different values at $x=0$ (i.e., $f(0)=\\alpha$).\n- The total number of solutions is the sum of the cardinalities of these disjoint sets over the set of choices for $\\alpha$:\n  $|S| = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in (0,1)} |S_\\alpha| = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in (0,1)} \\mathfrak{c}$.\n- This is a sum of $\\mathfrak{c}$ copies of $\\mathfrak{c}$. The result is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n- The cardinality of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. Our set of solutions is a subset of this, so its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n- Since we have shown there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions, the cardinality must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of such functions is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$ (or $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n<<<c>>>"
