    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined for $n \\ge 4$ by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The question asks about the semidihedral group of size 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we have $n=9$.\n    So, the group is $G = SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$. Its presentation is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $sr^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. The group has a cyclic subgroup of index 2, $\\langle r \\rangle$, of order 256.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k$:\n    $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Set of k-th Powers, $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute $g^k$ for every element $g \\in G$. There are two types of elements: those in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ and those in the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n1.  **For elements of the form $g = r^i$:**\n    $g^k = (r^i)^k = r^{ik}$.\n    The set of all such powers for a fixed $k$ is $\\{r^{ik} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\langle r^k \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **For elements of the form $g = sr^i$:**\n    We first need to find a formula for $(sr^i)^2$.\n    Using the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^j s = (srs)^j = (r^{127})^j = r^{127j}$.\n    $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i = s(s r^{127i})r^i = r^{127i} r^i = r^{128i}$.\n    (Note: In the general case for $SD_{2^n}$, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1+1)} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$. For $n=9$, this is $r^{i \\cdot 2^7} = r^{128i}$.)\n\nNow, we can compute $(sr^i)^k$ by considering two cases for the integer $k$.\n\n**Case A: $k$ is even**\n\nLet $k=2m$ for some integer $m$.\n$(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^{2m} = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im}$.\nSo for an even $k$, the set of $k$-th powers $G^k$ is:\n$G^k = \\{ (r^i)^k \\} \\cup \\{ (sr^i)^k \\} = \\langle r^k \\rangle \\cup \\{ r^{128im} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\nThe second set is $\\langle r^{128m} \\rangle = \\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\nSo, $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\nSince $k$ is a multiple of 2, $k$ divides $64k$. This means that any element in $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$ is also in $\\langle r^k \\rangle$. Therefore, $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle r^k \\rangle$.\nThe union is simply the larger subgroup: $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n\n**Case B: $k$ is odd**\n\nLet $k=2m+1$ for some integer $m$.\n$(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^{2m+1} = ((sr^i)^2)^m (sr^i) = (r^{128i})^m (sr^i) = r^{128im} sr^i$.\nUsing the relation $r^j s = s r^{127j}$, we can write:\n$r^{128im} s r^i = s r^{127 \\cdot 128im} r^i = s r^{i(127 \\cdot 128m + 1)}$.\nThe order of $r$ is 256. In the exponent, $127 \\cdot 128 \\equiv (-1) \\cdot 128 \\equiv -128 \\equiv 128 \\pmod{256}$.\nSo the exponent becomes $i(128m+1)$.\nThus, $(sr^i)^k = s r^{i(128m+1)}$.\nFor an odd $k$, the set of $k$-th powers $G^k$ is:\n$G^k = \\{ (r^i)^k \\} \\cup \\{ (sr^i)^k \\} = \\langle r^k \\rangle \\cup \\{ s r^{i(128m+1)} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n*   Since $k$ is odd, $gcd(k, 256)=1$. Thus, $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   The term $128m+1$ is also odd, so $gcd(128m+1, 256)=1$. This means that as $i$ runs through $\\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$, the exponent $i(128m+1) \\pmod{256}$ also takes on all values in $\\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$. The set $\\{ s r^{i(128m+1)} \\}$ is therefore the entire coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.\nSo, $G^k = \\langle r \\rangle \\cup s\\langle r \\rangle = G$.\nThis means for any odd integer $k$, the power subgroup is the group $G$ itself. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nFrom our analysis:\n1.  If $k$ is odd, $G^k = G$. This gives one power subgroup.\n2.  If $k$ is even, $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle$. We need to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way.\n\nA subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ is uniquely determined by $d = gcd(k, 256)$, since $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r^d \\rangle$. We need to find the set of all possible values for $d$ where $k$ is an even integer.\nLet $k=2j$ for some integer $j$. Then $d = gcd(2j, 256)$.\nSince $d$ must be a divisor of 256, $d$ must be a power of 2. The divisors of 256 are $2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^8$.\nSince $d$ must also be a divisor of the even number $k=2j$, $d$ must be even, unless $j$ is a multiple of 128 and... let's analyze more directly.\nAny common divisor of $2j$ and $256=2^8$ must be a power of 2.\nLet $d = gcd(2j, 2^8)$. Since $2j$ is even, the factor $2^1$ is always present in its prime factorization. So, the greatest common divisor $d$ must be at least $2^1=2$.\nWe can generate any even divisor of 256 as a value for $d$. For any even divisor $d'$ of 256, we can choose $k=d'$, which is even. Then $d = gcd(k, 256) = gcd(d', 256) = d'$.\nThe even divisors of 256 are:\n$2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, 2^7=128, 2^8=256$.\nThere are **8** such divisors. Each corresponds to a distinct subgroup:\n$\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\nThese 8 subgroups are all distinct and are proper subgroups of $G$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups of $G=SD_{512}$ is:\n*   The group $G$ itself (from any odd $k$).\n*   The 8 distinct cyclic subgroups $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d \\in \\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\\}$ (from even values of $k$).\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint, as the 8 cyclic subgroups are all proper subgroups of $G$.\nTotal number of power subgroups = $1 + 8 = 9$."
