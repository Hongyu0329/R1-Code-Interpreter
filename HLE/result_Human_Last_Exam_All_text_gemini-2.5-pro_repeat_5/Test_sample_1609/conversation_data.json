    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function `f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` that takes `n` binary inputs (variables valued 0 or 1) and produces a single binary output (0 or 1).\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (e.g., `x_1x_2'`) is an implicant of a function `f` if, whenever the product term is 1, the function `f` is also 1. This means the set of minterms covered by the product term is a subset of the minterms for which `f` is 1.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that is \"minimal\" in terms of its literals. If you remove any literal from a prime implicant, it ceases to be an implicant of the function. For example, in `f = x_1 + x_1x_2`, `x_1x_2` is an implicant, but it's not prime because if we remove `x_2`, we get `x_1`, which is also an implicant. `x_1` is a prime implicant.\n*   **a(n):** The question defines `a(n)` as the maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. To find `a(n)`, one must find the specific function of `n` variables that has the most PIs and then count them.\n\n### Step 2: Recognizing the Problem's Nature\n\nFinding the formula for `a(n)` is a well-known and difficult problem in switching theory and combinatorial mathematics. The value of `a(n)` is not given by a simple formula. Instead, the values for small `n` have been determined through complex constructions and proofs. This means the problem is less about deriving the answer from scratch and more about knowing the established results.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Sequence for a(n)\n\nThe sequence for `a(n)`, the maximal number of prime implicants, is a known sequence in mathematics and computer science. It is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001036. The first few terms of this sequence are:\n\n*   `a(0) = 1`\n*   `a(1) = 2`\n*   `a(2) = 4`\n*   `a(3) = 12`\n*   `a(4) = 32`\n*   `a(5) = 80`\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Growth and Lower Bounds (Careful Points)\n\nWhile we can rely on the known sequence, it's useful to understand why the number of PIs can be large.\n\n1.  **Parity Function:** The `n`-variable XOR function (odd parity) has minterms that are all isolated from each other in the `n`-cube. This means every minterm is a prime implicant. There are `2^(n-1)` such minterms. For `n=4`, this gives `2^(4-1) = 8` PIs. This provides a lower bound `a(4) >= 8`, but it's not the maximum.\n\n2.  **Product Construction:** If we have `f_k`, a function of `k` variables with `a(k)` PIs, and `f_{n-k}`, a function of `n-k` different variables with `a(n-k)` PIs, we can construct a new function `F = f_k \\cdot f_{n-k}`. The number of PIs of `F` is `a(k) \\cdot a(n-k)`. This gives us a better lower bound.\n    *   For `n=4`, we can try `k=1, n-k=3`: `a(4) >= a(1) \\cdot a(3) = 2 \\cdot 12 = 24`.\n    *   For `n=4`, we can try `k=2, n-k=2`: `a(4) >= a(2) \\cdot a(2) = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16`.\n    *   This tells us that `a(4)` must be at least 24.\n\n3.  **The Optimal Function:** The fact that `a(4)` is 32, which is greater than 24, implies that the function yielding the maximum number of PIs is not a simple product of functions on disjoint sets of variables. The variables must interact in a more complex way to generate more prime implicants. The constructions for these optimal functions are known but are quite intricate.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the established sequence for the maximal number of prime implicants, we can directly find the value for `n=4`.\n\n*   `a(0) = 1`\n*   `a(1) = 2`\n*   `a(2) = 4`\n*   `a(3) = 12`\n*   **`a(4) = 32`**\n\nThe question asks for `a(4)`, which corresponds to the fifth term in the sequence (starting from n=0).\n\n<<<32>>>"
