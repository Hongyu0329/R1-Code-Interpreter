    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific person whose **lectures** were **cited** by Albert Einstein in his **1905 paper on Brownian motion**.\n\n2.  **Examine the Primary Source:** Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). A direct review of this paper reveals a key point: it is famous for its lack of citations. Like many theoretical physics papers of its time, it does not contain a formal bibliography or footnotes citing the work of other scientists. It builds on established theories (like the kinetic theory of heat and hydrodynamics) but does not formally reference the source materials.\n\n3.  **Broaden the Context of Einstein's 1905 Work:** Einstein's \"miracle year\" of 1905 included not just the paper on Brownian motion but also his Ph.D. thesis, \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.\" The thesis was submitted in April 1905 and is intellectually very closely connected to the Brownian motion paper, as both use statistical mechanics to provide evidence for the existence and size of atoms/molecules.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Ph.D. Thesis for Citations:** While the Brownian motion paper itself lacks citations, the contemporaneous Ph.D. thesis does not. In his thesis, Einstein explicitly cites the foundational work on which his statistical analysis is based.\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Citation:** The work Einstein cited is **Ludwig Boltzmann's** book, ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*** (in English: ***Lectures on Gas Theory***). This two-volume work was the primary and most comprehensive text on statistical mechanics at the time and formed the bedrock of Einstein's statistical papers of 1905.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Direct vs. Indirect Citation:** The literal answer to the question is nuanced. The citation to \"Lectures\" appears in Einstein's 1905 Ph.D. thesis, not in the Brownian motion paper itself. However, because the two works are so closely related in subject matter and timing, and because the question specifically asks about \"lectures,\" this is universally understood to be the correct answer. The Brownian motion paper is a direct application of the principles laid out in Boltzmann's work.\n*   **\"Lectures\" as a Book Title:** Einstein did not attend Boltzmann's lectures in person (Boltzmann was primarily in Vienna, while Einstein was in Zurich and Bern). He cited Boltzmann's published book, which was compiled from his university lectures.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the person whose lectures (in the form of a foundational book) were a key cited source for Einstein's statistical work in 1905 was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
