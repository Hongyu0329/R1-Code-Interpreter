    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very first law passed by the legislature of the modern State of Israel (the Knesset) that used the specific legal term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew: \"תום לב\", *tom lev*). The question has specific formatting constraints: do not start the answer with \"the\" and do not include the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   A common answer might be the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for establishing \"good faith\" as a foundational, \"super-principle\" of Israeli law, applying it to both pre-contractual negotiations (Section 12) and the performance of contractual obligations (Section 39). However, while it made the principle universal in contract law, the question asks for the *first* statute to introduce it, not the one that gave it the broadest application.\n    *   Another strong candidate is the **Sale Law, 1968**. Section 6 of this law explicitly states that obligations and rights from a contract of sale must be performed and exercised \"in the customary manner and in good faith.\" This clearly predates the 1973 Contracts Law.\n\n3.  **Searching for an Earlier Statute:** The analysis must now focus on the period before 1968. We need to look at other specific areas of civil law that were codified by the Knesset in the early years of the state.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Statute:**\n    *   Before the major codifications of the late 1960s and 1970s, Israeli law relied heavily on laws inherited from the British Mandate. The Knesset undertook a process of creating \"New Versions\" (*Nusach Hadash*) of these older ordinances, re-enacting them in Hebrew as official Israeli statutes.\n    *   One such statute is the **Negotiable Instruments Ordinance [New Version]**, which was enacted by the Knesset in **1957**.\n    *   This ordinance governs instruments like checks and bills of exchange. A central concept in this area of law is the \"holder in due course\" (in Hebrew: \"אוחז כשורה\", *ochaz k'shura*).\n    *   Section 28(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Ordinance [New Version], 1957, defines a holder in due course as one who took the instrument, among other conditions, \"**in good faith** (*be'tom lev*) and for value.\"\n    *   This is an explicit, statutory use of the term \"good faith\" as a core legal requirement.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Final Check:**\n    *   The Negotiable Instruments Ordinance [New Version] was enacted in 1957.\n    *   The Sale Law was enacted in 1968.\n    *   The Contracts (General Part) Law was enacted in 1973.\n    *   Chronologically, the 1957 ordinance is the earliest of these key statutes. It is a statute of the modern State of Israel (having been enacted by the Knesset) and it explicitly introduces the concept of \"good faith.\" Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question demands a statute that *explicitly introduces* the concept. We are looking for the literal words \"good faith\" or \"תום לב\" in the law's text, not just a law where the principle could be inferred by a judge.\n*   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** This means the law must be a product of the Knesset, not a British Mandate or Ottoman law that was merely kept in force. The \"New Version\" process, where the Knesset re-enacted Mandate-era ordinances, satisfies this condition.\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Important\":** It's crucial not to confuse the first appearance of the term with its most significant or expansive application. The Contracts Law of 1973 is arguably the most important for the principle of good faith, but it was not the first.\n\n<<<Negotiable Instruments Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
