    "This question asks for the number of different types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2. A stable reduction of a curve is the special fiber of a stable model, and it is a stable curve of the same arithmetic genus. Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for the number of distinct combinatorial types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of a Stable Curve and Genus Formula\n\nA stable curve $C$ of arithmetic genus $g \\ge 2$ is a complete connected nodal curve such that its automorphism group is finite. A nodal curve is a curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n\nThe key condition for the finiteness of the automorphism group is that every \"unstable\" component must be \"stabilized\" by other components. Specifically:\n1.  Any smooth rational component (a component whose normalization is $\\mathbb{P}^1$) must intersect other components in at least 3 points.\n2.  Any smooth elliptic component (a component whose normalization is an elliptic curve) must intersect other components.\n\nHowever, the first condition is a strong condition that is sufficient for stability. A weaker condition is that the curve is semi-stable (where smooth rational components must intersect others in at least 2 points) and the total automorphism group of the curve is finite. For genus 2, some semi-stable configurations turn out to have finite automorphism groups and are thus stable. This subtlety is crucial.\n\nThe arithmetic genus $g_a(C)$ of a nodal curve $C$ is given by the formula:\n$g_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\delta - n + 1$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the number of irreducible components of $C$.\n*   $g_i$ is the geometric genus of the normalization of the $i$-th component.\n*   $\\delta$ is the total number of nodes on $C$.\n\nWe are looking for configurations of components and nodes such that $g_a(C)=2$.\n\n### Step 2: Classification by Number of Components\n\nLet's classify the possible structures based on the number of components, $n$.\n\n**Case 1: $n=1$ (The curve is irreducible)**\nThe formula becomes $g_a(C) = g_1 + \\delta - 1 + 1 = g_1 + \\delta = 2$.\n*   **Type I (Good Reduction):** $\\delta=0, g_1=2$. The curve is a smooth curve of genus 2.\n*   **Type II:** $\\delta=1, g_1=1$. The curve is an irreducible curve with one node, and its normalization is an elliptic curve.\n*   **Type III:** $\\delta=2, g_1=0$. The curve is an irreducible curve with two nodes, and its normalization is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\n**Case 2: $n=2$ (The curve has two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$)**\nThe formula is $g_a(C) = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 2 + 1 = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 1 = 2$, so $g_1+g_2+\\delta=3$. The curve must be connected, so there is at least one node connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$. Let's assume $g_1 \\ge g_2$.\n*   **Subcase 2a: $g_1=1, g_2=1$.**\n    $1+1+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=1$. The components must be smooth (no self-intersections). The two elliptic curves intersect at one point. This is stable.\n    **Type IV:** Two smooth elliptic curves meeting at one node.\n*   **Subcase 2b: $g_1=1, g_2=0$.**\n    $1+0+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=2$. Let $\\delta_{11}$ be nodes on $C_1$, $\\delta_{22}$ on $C_2$, and $\\delta_{12}$ between them. $\\delta = \\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}+\\delta_{12}=2$.\n    The rational component $C_2$ must be stable. If it's smooth ($\\delta_{22}=0$), it must meet $C_1$ in $\\delta_{12} \\ge 3$ points. But $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{12}=2$, so this is impossible. Thus, $C_2$ must be singular, i.e., $\\delta_{22} \\ge 1$.\n    With $\\delta=2$, $\\delta_{12} \\ge 1$ (connectedness), and $\\delta_{22} \\ge 1$, the only integer solution is $\\delta_{12}=1, \\delta_{22}=1, \\delta_{11}=0$.\n    **Type V:** A smooth elliptic curve meeting a rational curve with one node at a single point.\n*   **Subcase 2c: $g_1=0, g_2=0$.**\n    $0+0+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=3$.\n    If both components are smooth, they must intersect each other in $\\delta_{12} \\ge 3$ points. With $\\delta=3$, this gives $\\delta_{12}=3$.\n    **Type VI:** Two smooth rational curves meeting at three nodes.\n    If both components are singular ($\\delta_{11}\\ge 1, \\delta_{22}\\ge 1$), and they meet at one point ($\\delta_{12}=1$), then $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}=2$. The only symmetric solution is $\\delta_{11}=1, \\delta_{22}=1$.\n    **Type VII:** Two rational curves, each with one node, meeting at a single point.\n\n**Case 3: $n=3$ (The curve has three components, $C_1, C_2, C_3$)**\nThe formula is $g_a(C) = g_1+g_2+g_3+\\delta-3+1 = g_1+g_2+g_3+\\delta-2 = 2$, so $g_1+g_2+g_3+\\delta=4$. It can be shown that no component can have genus $\\ge 1$, so all components must be rational ($g_i=0$). This gives $\\delta=4$.\nThe stability condition for smooth rational components is relaxed for genus 2 stable curves: a smooth rational component that meets the rest of the curve in exactly two points is permissible if the total automorphism group of the curve is finite. This allows for two more types.\n*   The components are arranged in a line $C_1-C_2-C_3$. All components are rational ($g_i=0$).\n    Let $C_1, C_3$ be singular with one node each ($\\delta_{11}=1, \\delta_{33}=1$) and $C_2$ be smooth ($\\delta_{22}=0$). Let them be connected by single nodes ($\\delta_{12}=1, \\delta_{23}=1$).\n    Then $\\delta = \\delta_{11}+\\delta_{33}+\\delta_{12}+\\delta_{23} = 1+1+1+1=4$.\n    The genus formula gives $g_a = 0 + 4 - 3 + 1 = 2$.\n    The middle component $C_2$ is smooth and rational, and it meets the other components in $\\delta_{12}+\\delta_{23}=2$ points. This configuration has a finite automorphism group and is stable.\n    **Type VIII:** A chain of three rational curves, where the two outer components each have one node, and the middle one is smooth, connected by single nodes.\n*   The components are again in a line $C_1-C_3-C_2$, but now $C_1, C_2$ are elliptic ($g_1=1, g_2=1$) and $C_3$ is a smooth rational curve ($g_3=0$).\n    The genus formula is $g_a = (g_1+g_2+g_3)+\\delta-n+1 = (1+1+0)+\\delta-3+1 = \\delta$. For $g_a=2$, we need $\\delta=2$.\n    For the graph to be a line, we need $\\delta_{13}=1, \\delta_{23}=1$, and all other nodes are zero.\n    The rational component $C_3$ meets the other components in $\\delta_{13}+\\delta_{23}=2$ points. Again, this configuration is stable for genus 2.\n    **Type IX:** A smooth rational curve forming a bridge between two smooth elliptic curves, connected by single nodes.\n\n### Step 3: Final Count\n\nLet's list all the types of stable reduction found:\n1.  **Type I:** Smooth curve of genus 2 (good reduction).\n2.  **Type II:** Irreducible with one node (normalization is elliptic).\n3.  **Type III:** Irreducible with two nodes (normalization is rational).\n4.  **Type IV:** Two elliptic curves meeting at one point.\n5.  **Type V:** An elliptic curve and a nodal rational curve meeting at one point.\n6.  **Type VI:** Two smooth rational curves meeting at three points.\n7.  **Type VII:** Two nodal rational curves meeting at one point.\n8.  **Type VIII:** A chain of three rational curves, the outer two being nodal.\n9.  **Type IX:** Two elliptic curves connected by a rational curve \"bridge\".\n\nCounting all these distinct combinatorial types, we have a total of 9 different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2."
