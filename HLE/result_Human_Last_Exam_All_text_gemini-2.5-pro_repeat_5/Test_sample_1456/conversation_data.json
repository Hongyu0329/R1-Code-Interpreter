    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. A continuum is **nondegenerate** if it consists of more than one point.\n*   **Product of Continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their Cartesian product `Z = X x Y` with the product topology is also a continuum. Since `X` and `Y` are compact and connected, so is `X x Y`. Since they are metric, `X x Y` is metrizable.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. A subcontinuum is proper if it is not the entire space `X`.\n*   **Decomposability:** A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if it can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is **indecomposable**.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Number of Composants to Decomposability\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that connects the number of composants of a continuum to its decomposability:\n\n1.  A continuum has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is **decomposable**. In a decomposable continuum, any two points lie in a common proper subcontinuum, so all points belong to the same composant.\n2.  A continuum has **uncountably many** composants if and only if it is **indecomposable**. Specifically, the number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (`c = |R| = 2^{\\aleph_0}`). In an indecomposable continuum, the composants form a partition of the space into `c` distinct, dense, path-connected sets.\n\nThis simplifies the problem: to find the largest possible number of composants of `X x Y`, we need to determine if `X x Y` can be indecomposable. If it can, the largest number is `c`. If it must always be decomposable, the number is always 1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Decomposability of the Product Space `X x Y`\n\nLet's analyze under what conditions the product `Z = X x Y` is decomposable.\n\n*   **Case 1: At least one factor (`X` or `Y`) is decomposable.**\n    Suppose `X` is decomposable. By definition, there exist two proper subcontinua, `A` and `B`, of `X` such that `X = A U B`.\n    We can then write the product space `Z` as:\n    `Z = X x Y = (A U B) x Y = (A x Y) U (B x Y)`\n    Let `Z_A = A x Y` and `Z_B = B x Y`.\n    *   Is `Z_A` a subcontinuum of `Z`? Yes, because it is the product of two continua, `A` and `Y`.\n    *   Is `Z_A` a *proper* subcontinuum of `Z`? Yes. Since `A` is a proper subcontinuum of `X`, there is a point `x' ∈ X` such that `x' ∉ A`. Since `Y` is nondegenerate, it has at least one point `y'`. Then the point `(x', y')` is in `X x Y` but not in `A x Y`. So `A x Y` is a proper subset.\n    *   Similarly, `Z_B` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    Since `Z = Z_A U Z_B`, we have written `Z` as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Therefore, `Z = X x Y` is decomposable.\n    By the same logic, if `Y` is decomposable, `X x Y` is also decomposable.\n\n    **Conclusion for Case 1:** If either `X` or `Y` is a decomposable continuum, their product `X x Y` is decomposable and has exactly **one** composant.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both factors (`X` and `Y`) are indecomposable.**\n    To find a number of composants greater than one, we must consider the case where both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable. The question is whether their product `X x Y` can be indecomposable.\n\n    It is a known result that the product of two indecomposable continua is **not necessarily** indecomposable. For instance, if `K` is the Knaster continuum (a well-known indecomposable continuum), the product `K x K` is decomposable. In this specific case, the number of composants of `K x K` would be 1.\n\n    However, the question asks for the **largest possible** number. This requires us to find if there exists *any* pair of indecomposable continua whose product is indecomposable. The answer is yes.\n\n    *   **The Pseudo-arc:** The pseudo-arc, denoted `P`, is a particularly famous indecomposable continuum. It is nondegenerate and has the strong property of being *hereditarily indecomposable* (meaning every one of its subcontinua is indecomposable).\n    *   **Theorem (R. H. Bing, 1951):** The product of the pseudo-arc with itself, `P x P`, is hereditarily indecomposable, and therefore indecomposable.\n    *   **Theorem (J. L. Kelley):** For any indecomposable continuum `X`, the product `X x P` is indecomposable.\n\n    These theorems guarantee the existence of an indecomposable product of two nondegenerate continua. For example, we can choose `X = P` and `Y = P`. Both are nondegenerate continua. Their product `Z = P x P` is indecomposable.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  The number of composants of a continuum is either 1 (if decomposable) or `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, if indecomposable).\n2.  We can construct a product of two nondegenerate continua, `X x Y`, that is indecomposable (for example, by taking `X` and `Y` to be the pseudo-arc).\n3.  For such an indecomposable product, the number of composants is `c`.\n4.  Since the only possible values are 1 and `c`, the largest possible number is `c`.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
