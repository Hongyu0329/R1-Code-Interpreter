    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga and finding the conditions that maximize its rank.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Flag and the Matrix**\n\n*   **Flag of Tonga:** The flag is red with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red \"cross couped\" (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n*   **Matrix Representation:** We create a matrix where each red pixel is given the value $a$ and each white pixel is given the value $b$. To maximize the rank, we should assume $a \\neq b$. If $a=b$, the matrix would be constant, and its rank would be 1.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the Matrix Structure**\n\nLet the full image be represented by an $M \\times N$ matrix, which we'll call $A$. Let the canton occupy the top-left $m \\times n$ submatrix. The matrix $A$ has a block structure:\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} C & R_1 \\\\ R_2 & R_3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $C$ is the $m \\times n$ matrix for the canton. Its entries are a mix of $a$ (for the red cross) and $b$ (for the white field).\n*   $R_1, R_2, R_3$ are matrices representing the main red field of the flag. All entries in these blocks are $a$.\n\n**3. Simplify the Matrix Using Row/Column Operations**\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations.\n1.  All rows below the canton (from row $m+1$ to $M$) are identical, consisting of all $a$'s: $[a, a, \\dots, a]$. These $M-m$ rows are linearly dependent and contribute only 1 dimension to the row space.\n2.  Let's take the last row, $R_M = [a, a, \\dots, a]$, as a base.\n3.  We can subtract $R_M$ from all other all-$a$ rows (rows $m+1$ to $M-1$), making them zero rows. These zero rows do not contribute to the rank.\n4.  We can also perform a similar operation on the rows within the canton. For a row $i$ (where $1 \\le i \\le m$), its original form is $[c_{i1}, \\dots, c_{in}, a, \\dots, a]$. Subtracting $R_M$ from this row gives $[c_{i1}-a, \\dots, c_{in}-a, 0, \\dots, 0]$.\n5.  After these operations, the matrix is transformed into a new matrix $A'$ with the same rank:\n    $A' = \\begin{pmatrix} C - aJ & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ \\dots & \\dots \\\\ a, \\dots, a & a, \\dots, a \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Here, $J$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix of all ones, and the last row is the only non-zero row remaining from the red field.\n6.  The rows of $(C - aJ)$ are zero in the columns where the last row is non-zero (i.e., columns $n+1$ to $N$). Therefore, the row space of $A'$ is the direct sum of the row space of $(C - aJ)$ and the space spanned by the last row.\n7.  This means `rank(A) = rank(C - aJ) + 1` (assuming $a \\neq 0$ and the red field exists).\n8.  Let's analyze the matrix `C - aJ`. The original values in $C$ were $a$ for red and $b$ for white.\n    *   Red pixels: $a - a = 0$\n    *   White pixels: $b - a$\n9.  So, `C - aJ` is a matrix where the red cross is represented by `0`s and the white field by the constant `b-a`. Let's call this matrix `M_canton`. Assuming $a \\neq b$, `rank(M_canton)` is the same as the rank of a 0-1 matrix where 1s represent the white field and 0s represent the red cross. Let's call this 0-1 matrix `M_cross`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximal rank of `M_cross` and adding 1.\n\n**4. Find the Maximal Rank of the Canton Matrix (`M_cross`)**\n\n`M_cross` is an $m \\times n$ matrix of 1s (the white field) with a hole of 0s in the shape of a cross. The cross itself is the union of two overlapping rectangular regions: a horizontal one (`H`) and a vertical one (`V`). The rank of `M_cross` is determined by the number of linearly independent row and column patterns it contains.\n\nA row's pattern is defined by the positions of its zeros. The set of zero positions in a row depends on how that row intersects the rectangles `H` and `V`. There are four possibilities for a row:\n1.  It intersects neither `H` nor `V` (this corresponds to the white margin above or below the cross). The pattern is all 1s.\n2.  It intersects `V` but not `H`. The pattern is a row of 1s with a block of 0s corresponding to the width of `V`.\n3.  It intersects `H` but not `V`. The pattern is a row of 1s with a block of 0s corresponding to the width of `H`.\n4.  It intersects both `H` and `V`. The pattern has zeros corresponding to the union of the widths of `H` and `V`.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we want to create a geometry where all four of these distinct row patterns exist and are linearly independent. This can be achieved by \"staggering\" the rectangles `H` and `V`.\n\n*   **Example Geometry:** Consider an $8 \\times 8$ canton. Let the vertical bar `V` occupy rows 2-5 and columns 2-5. Let the horizontal bar `H` occupy rows 4-7 and columns 4-7. This represents a valid, albeit asymmetric, couped cross.\n    *   **Row 1:** Misses both `H` and `V`. Pattern: `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`.\n    *   **Rows 2, 3:** Intersect `V` only. Pattern: `[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]`.\n    *   **Rows 4, 5:** Intersect both `H` and `V`. Pattern: `[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]`.\n    *   **Rows 6, 7:** Intersect `H` only. Pattern: `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1]`.\n    *   **Row 8:** Misses both. Same pattern as row 1.\n\nWe have successfully created four distinct row patterns. These four pattern vectors can be shown to be linearly independent. By a symmetric argument, we can also create four linearly independent column patterns. Therefore, the maximal rank of `M_cross` is 4.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Maximal Rank**\n\nWe established that `rank(A) = rank(M_cross) + 1`.\nSince the maximal rank of `M_cross` is 4, the maximal rank of the entire flag matrix `A` is:\nMax Rank = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis maximum is achieved when:\n*   $a \\neq b$ (the colors have different values).\n*   $a \\neq 0$ (the red color is not zero).\n*   The flag has a red field outside the canton.\n*   The geometry of the cross in the canton is arranged to produce the four distinct types of row/column patterns, as described above.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximal possible rank of the matrix is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
