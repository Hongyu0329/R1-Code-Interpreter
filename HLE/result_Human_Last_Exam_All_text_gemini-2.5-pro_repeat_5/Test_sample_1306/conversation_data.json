    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object of study\nThe question asks about the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let's denote the quantum group by $U_q$. The condition that $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (i.e., $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, so the order is $l=3$) is crucial. In this case, the representation theory of $U_q$ is much richer than in the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity). Specifically, the category of finite-dimensional representations is not semisimple, which means there exist indecomposable representations that are not irreducible. The question is to find the percentage of irreducible representations among all indecomposable representations.\n\n### Step 2: The structure of the category of representations\nThe category of finite-dimensional $U_q$-modules, let's call it $U_q$-mod(fd), has a block decomposition. The blocks are indexed by the characters of the center of $U_q$. When $q$ is a primitive $l$-th root of unity, the center of $U_q$ is large. It is generated by the elements $E^l, F^l, K^l$ (where here $l=3$) and the quantum Casimir element. A character $\\chi$ of the center is determined by the scalars $\\chi(E^l), \\chi(F^l), \\chi(K^l)$ and $\\chi(\\text{Casimir})$.\n\nThe blocks of $U_q$-mod(fd) fall into two main types:\n\n1.  **Singular (or Principal) Blocks:** These are the blocks where the central elements $E^l$ and $F^l$ act as zero. For $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$, there are a finite number of such blocks. In our case ($l=3$), there are two, corresponding to the central character having $K^3=1$ or $K^3=-1$. These blocks are equivalent to the category of representations of the *small quantum group* $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.\n\n2.  **Regular (or Semi-cyclic) Blocks:** These are the blocks where at least one of $E^l$ or $F^l$ acts non-trivially. The central characters corresponding to these blocks form a Zariski open and dense subset of the space of all central characters. This means that a \"generic\" or \"randomly chosen\" block is of this type.\n\nThe category $C$ in the question is the collection of all indecomposable objects from all these blocks.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the proportion of irreducibles in each type of block\n\n**For the singular blocks:**\nThe representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is well-understood. For $l=3$, the principal block (where $K^3=1$) contains:\n*   **A finite number of simple (irreducible) modules.** These are the modules $L_0, L_1, L_2$ of dimensions 1, 2, and 3 respectively. So there are 3 irreducibles.\n*   **An infinite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.** The classification of these modules is given by the Auslander-Reiten theory. The AR-quiver for this block contains so-called \"tubes\". Each tube corresponding to a non-projective simple module contains an infinite family of distinct indecomposable modules. For $l=3$, the simple modules $L_0$ and $L_1$ are not projective, and each gives rise to a tube containing infinitely many indecomposables.\nTherefore, in each singular block, there are finitely many irreducible objects and infinitely many indecomposable objects. The percentage of irreducible objects in a singular block is $0\\%$.\n\n**For the regular blocks:**\nA key result in the theory is that any regular block is **Morita equivalent** to the category of finite-dimensional modules over the **Taft algebra** $T_l$. For our case, $l=3$.\n*   The Taft algebra $T_3$ is a 9-dimensional algebra. Its representation theory is of tame type and is completely understood.\n*   The number of non-isomorphic simple (irreducible) modules over $T_3$ is $l=3$.\n*   The number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules over $T_3$ is $l^2=9$.\n*   A Morita equivalence is an equivalence of categories that preserves many properties, including the number of simple objects and the number of indecomposable objects.\nTherefore, any regular block of $U_q$-mod(fd) contains exactly 3 simple (irreducible) objects and 9 indecomposable objects.\n\nSo, in any regular block, the percentage of irreducible objects is $(3 / 9) \\times 100\\% = (1/3) \\times 100\\% = 33.\\overline{3}\\%$.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the question and synthesize the final answer\n\nThe question asks for a single percentage for the entire category $C$, which is composed of all indecomposable objects from all blocks. We have:\n*   A finite number of singular blocks where the percentage is $0\\%$.\n*   An infinite family of regular blocks, parameterized by a dense open subset of the space of central characters, where the percentage is $33.\\overline{3}\\%$.\n\nThe ambiguity of calculating a percentage over an infinite set is resolved by considering the \"generic\" case. Since the regular blocks are generic (they correspond to a \"full measure\" subset of the parameter space of all blocks), the properties of a randomly chosen indecomposable module will be governed by the structure of the regular blocks. The singular blocks are exceptional. Thus, the percentage of irreducible objects in the entire category $C$ is taken to be the percentage found in a generic (i.e., regular) block.\n\nThis percentage is $1/3$.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe number of irreducible objects in a generic block is $l=3$.\nThe total number of indecomposable objects in a generic block is $l^2=9$.\nThe ratio is $l/l^2 = 1/l = 1/3$.\nAs a percentage, this is $(1/3) \\times 100\\% = 33.333...\\%$."
