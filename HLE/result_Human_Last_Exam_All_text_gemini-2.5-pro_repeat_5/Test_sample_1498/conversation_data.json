    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the range of verses (abyat) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Poem**\n'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is a didactic poem that systematically lays out the fundamental tenets of Islamic creed according to the Ash'ari school. It follows a logical order: belief in Allah and His attributes, then belief in His Messengers and their attributes, followed by a list of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an, and so on. We need to locate the specific section dedicated to naming the prophets.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Introductory Verse**\nBefore listing the names, the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, typically introduces the topic. Looking at the poem, we find a verse that explicitly states the number of prophets whose names are obligatory to know.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish between the verse that *introduces* the list and the verse where the list *begins*.\n*   **Bayt 29** serves as this introduction:\n    > وَتَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n    > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *Translation: \"And the details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every legally responsible person, so verify and benefit.\"*\n    This verse tells us that a list of 25 names is coming, but it does not contain any of the names itself.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Starting Verse of the List**\nThe actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins immediately after the introductory verse.\n\n*   **Bayt 30** is the first verse that starts listing the names:\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n    > صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *Translation: \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed.\"*\n    This is definitively the start of the list.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the List to its Conclusion**\nWe must now follow the poem verse by verse to see where the list of 25 prophets ends.\n\n*   **Bayt 31** continues the list: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n*   **Bayt 32** continues further: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n*   **Bayt 33** presents the final names in the list:\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n    > عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *Translation: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa (Jesus), and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal; leave falsehood.\"*\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Final Verse of the List**\nThe list concludes in Bayt 33 with the mention of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is described as the \"Seal\" (خَاتِمٌ - khātim), signifying the end of the prophetic line. The next verse, Bayt 34, moves on to a new topic (the angels), confirming that the list of prophets has ended.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The reference to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ as \"Taha\" and \"Khatim\" (the Seal) is the clear marker for the end of the enumeration.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the enumeration of the names of the 25 prophets starts at **Bayt 30** and concludes at **Bayt 33**.\n\n<<<From Bayt 30 to Bayt 33>>>"
