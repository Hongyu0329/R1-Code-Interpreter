    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n**Core Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization:**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices wrapping around each other. Their structure is defined by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, the heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and number of helices (oligomeric state) are primarily determined by the amino acids at the core positions, 'a' and 'd'.\n\n*   **'a' and 'd' positions:** Typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. Their size, shape, and polarity dictate how the helices pack together.\n*   **'e' and 'g' positions:** Typically occupied by charged or polar residues, forming stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n\n**General Rules for Oligomer State Prediction:**\n\n1.  **Dimers (2-helix coils):** Often have a canonical hydrophobic core. A classic example is the GCN4 leucine zipper, which has Valine (V) or Asparagine (N) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position. Generally, `a=hydrophobic`, `d=hydrophobic` favors dimers.\n2.  **Trimers (3-helix coils):** Frequently have Isoleucine (I) at both the 'a' and 'd' positions (`a=I, d=I`). Alternatively, placing a charged residue like Glutamic acid (E) at the 'a' position is a known strategy to enforce a trimeric state.\n3.  **Tetramers (4-helix coils):** Often feature a hydrophobic residue (like I or L) at the 'a' position and a small polar residue (like Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q), or Threonine (T)) at the 'd' position. This `a=hydrophobic, d=polar` arrangement allows the polar 'd' residues to form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network down the center of the four-helix bundle.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence:**\n\nFor each sequence, we must first identify the correct heptad `(abcdefg)` register to locate the crucial 'a' and 'd' residues. We will test different registers to find the one that best fits the known principles.\n\n**1. Sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Analysis:** Let's test the register starting with 'a': `(a)E (b)I (c)A (d)Q ...`. This places Glutamic acid (E) at all 'a' positions and a mix of Glutamine (Q), Lysine (K), and Tryptophan (W) at the 'd' positions.\n*   **Core:** `a = (E, E, E, E)`, `d = (Q, K, W, Q)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Placing a charged residue like E at the 'a' position is a strong design principle for inducing a **trimer**. The polar/charged core is unfavorable in a dimer and the specific packing of E favors a 3-fold symmetry.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 3 (Trimer)**\n\n**2. Sequence: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence is 30 amino acids long, suggesting it doesn't fit a perfect 4x7 heptad repeat. However, we can still identify the dominant repeating pattern. Let's test a register shifted by one residue, starting with `I` at the 'a' position: `E(g) I(a) A(b) A(c) L(d) ...`. This register reveals a consistent hydrophobic core.\n*   **Core:** Applying this register across the sequence, we find `a` positions are `(I, I, N, I)` and `d` positions are `(L, L, L, L)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The core is dominated by `a=I` and `d=L`. This is a classic hydrophobic core combination, very similar to the GCN4 dimer. The single polar Asn (N) substitution is a minor perturbation that does not change the overall dimeric preference.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2 (Dimer)**\n\n**3. Sequence: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Analysis:** Let's test the register `E(g) I(a) A(b) A(c) I(d) ...`.\n*   **Core:** The 'a' positions are all Isoleucine (I). The 'd' positions are mostly Isoleucine (I) with one Tryptophan (W): `a = (I, I, I, I)`, `d = (I, I, W, I)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** A core composed of Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions is a hallmark of a **trimer**. While the bulky Tryptophan (W) at one 'd' position could favor a tetramer in some contexts, here it is an exception in a strongly trimer-forming sequence. The structure will likely remain trimeric to satisfy the packing preference of the other `I-I` pairs.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 3 (Trimer)**\n\n**4. Sequence: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence is very similar in composition to sequence 1. Let's test the same register, `(a)E (b)I (c)Q (d)K ...`.\n*   **Core:** `a = (E, E, E, E)`, `d = (K, K, W, K)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** As with sequence 1, the core is defined by having Glutamic acid (E) at all 'a' positions. This strongly favors a **trimer**. The 'd' positions are mostly the charged residue Lysine (K) with one Tryptophan (W). This polar/charged core is consistent with a trimeric structure stabilized by inter-helical electrostatic interactions.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 3 (Trimer)**\n\n**5. Sequence: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Analysis:** Let's test the register `E(g) I(a) A(b) Q(c) T(d) ...`. The varying residue (Q/K/W) is at the 'c' position, not affecting the core.\n*   **Core:** The 'a' positions are all Isoleucine (I), and the 'd' positions are all Threonine (T): `a = (I, I, I, I)`, `d = (T, T, T, T)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence has a hydrophobic residue (I) at the 'a' position and a polar residue (T) at the 'd' position. This `a=hydrophobic, d=polar` pattern is a classic design for a **tetramer**. The polar Threonine side chains can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bonded network down the central axis of the four-helix bundle.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 4 (Tetramer)**\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\n1.  Sequence 1: **3** (Trimer)\n2.  Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n3.  Sequence 3: **3** (Trimer)\n4.  Sequence 4: **3** (Trimer)\n5.  Sequence 5: **4** (Tetramer)\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of numbers `3, 2, 3, 3, 4`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
