    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept - Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (also known as trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel becomes short. The primary condition for this rule to apply is that the vowel must be in the antepenultimate syllable, which is the third syllable from the end of a word.\n\nFor example:\n*   The word `sane` has a long vowel /eɪ/. When we add the suffix `-ity` to make `sanity` (san-i-ty), the vowel is now in the third-to-last syllable. Trisyllabic laxing applies, and the long /eɪ/ shortens to a lax /æ/.\n*   The word `divine` has a long vowel (diphthong) /aɪ/. In `divinity` (di-vin-i-ty), the vowel is in the third-to-last syllable and shortens to /ɪ/.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word against the rule.**\n\nWe will examine each word to see if it meets the criteria for trisyllabic laxing. A key point is that the word must be at least three syllables long for the rule to even be considered. We also check if the vowel in the relevant syllable was historically long and then became short.\n\n1.  **southern**:\n    *   **Syllables:** `south-ern` (two syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is only two syllables long. Therefore, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing, as there is no third-to-last syllable. While the vowel has changed from its root `south` (/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/), this is due to a different historical shortening process that occurred in Old English, not trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**:\n    *   **Syllables:** `de-riv-a-tive` (four syllables). The third-to-last syllable is `-riv-`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is derived from `derive`, which has a long vowel /aɪ/ in its stressed syllable (`de-rive`). In `derivative`, the corresponding vowel in the antepenultimate syllable has been shortened to /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of a word that **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**:\n    *   **Syllables:** `se-ren-i-ty` (four syllables). The third-to-last syllable is `-ren-`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is derived from `serene`, which has a long vowel /iː/ (`se-rene`). In `serenity`, this vowel in the antepenultimate syllable has been shortened (laxed) to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is another clear example of a word that **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**:\n    *   **Syllables:** `pleas-ant` (two syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** Like `southern`, this word is only two syllables long and thus cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing. It is related to the word `please` (/pliːz/), which has a long vowel. The shortening to /ɛ/ in `pleasant` is an example of a different rule: shortening before a consonant cluster (`-sant`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n5.  **gratitude**:\n    *   **Syllables:** `grat-i-tude` (three syllables). The third-to-last syllable is `grat-`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is related to `grateful`, which preserves the long vowel /eɪ/ from its root. In the three-syllable word `gratitude`, the vowel in the antepenultimate syllable has been shortened to /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is another example of a word that **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**:\n    *   **Syllables:** `shad-ow` (two syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is only two syllables long, so it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing. More importantly, looking at its history (from Old English `sceadu`), the vowel in its first syllable has *always* been short. Since the vowel was never long to begin with, it could not have been shortened or \"laxed\" by any process.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the candidates and select the final answer.**\n\nThree words did not undergo trisyllabic laxing: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. All are two-syllable words. However, the question asks for the best example.\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` are related to words with long vowels (`south`, `please`), and they did undergo vowel shortening, just not of the *trisyllabic* type.\n*   `shadow` is the most definitive answer because not only is it the wrong number of syllables for the rule, but its root vowel was historically short. Therefore, it couldn't have undergone *any* kind of vowel shortening or laxing process. It fails the conditions for laxing in the most fundamental way.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
