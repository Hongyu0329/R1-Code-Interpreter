    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve and its Genus:**\n    The curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\n    This is a hyperelliptic curve. The genus of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is given by $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f) - 1) / 2 \\rfloor$.\n    Here, $\\deg(f) = 5$, so the genus is $g = \\lfloor (5 - 1) / 2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n    By the Stable Reduction Theorem, the arithmetic genus of the stable reduction of $C$ must also be 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reduction using the Newton Polygon:**\n    We analyze the curve over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The prime is $p=2$. We need to find the stable reduction modulo 2. The main tool for this is the Newton polygon of the polynomial $f(x)$.\n    The coefficients of $f(x)$ are $c_5=8, c_4=4, c_3=4, c_2=1, c_1=8, c_0=0$.\n    We plot the points $(i, v_2(c_i))$ for each non-zero coefficient $c_i$, where $v_2$ is the 2-adic valuation (the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization).\n    *   $v_2(c_5) = v_2(8) = 3 \\implies$ point (5, 3)\n    *   $v_2(c_4) = v_2(4) = 2 \\implies$ point (4, 2)\n    *   $v_2(c_3) = v_2(4) = 2 \\implies$ point (3, 2)\n    *   $v_2(c_2) = v_2(1) = 0 \\implies$ point (2, 0)\n    *   $v_2(c_1) = v_2(8) = 3 \\implies$ point (1, 3)\n    The Newton polygon is the lower convex hull of these points.\n    *   Starting from the leftmost point (1,3), the slope to (2,0) is $(0-3)/(2-1) = -3$.\n    *   From (2,0), the slope to (4,2) is $(2-0)/(4-2) = 1$. The slope to (5,3) is $(3-0)/(5-2)=1$. The point (3,2) lies above the line segment connecting (2,0) and (4,2).\n    The Newton polygon consists of two segments with different slopes:\n    *   **Segment 1 ($S_1$):** From (1, 3) to (2, 0). Slope = -3.\n    *   **Segment 2 ($S_2$):** From (2, 0) to (5, 3). Slope = 1.\n    The polygon has a vertex at (2,0) where the slope changes.\n\n3.  **Determine the Components of the Special Fiber:**\n    The structure of the Newton polygon tells us about the special fiber of the minimal regular model of the curve.\n    *   Each segment of the polygon corresponds to a component of the special fiber. Since there are two segments, there are two components, let's call them $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n    *   Each vertex where segments meet corresponds to an intersection point. Since the two segments meet at the vertex (2,0), the components $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect at one point. This intersection is a node (an ordinary double point).\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Component:**\n    We determine the nature of each component by looking at its corresponding residual polynomial.\n    *   **Component $C_1$ (from $S_1$):** With a suitable change of coordinates ($x=2^3 x', y=2^3 y'$), the equation for this component reduces to $y'^2 = x'^2 + x'$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This is the equation of a smooth conic, which is isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$. It is a smooth curve of genus 0. It has no self-intersections (no double points on its own). Its arithmetic genus is $p_a(C_1)=0$.\n    *   **Component $C_2$ (from $S_2$):** With a suitable change of coordinates ($x=2^{-1} x', y=2^{-1} y'$), the equation reduces to $y'^2 = x'^5 + x'^4 + x'^2 = x'^2(x'^3+x'^2+1)$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n        *   This curve is singular. The singularity is at $(0,0)$. The lowest degree terms are $y'^2-x'^2 = (y'-x')^2 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This type of singularity is a cusp, which is not an ordinary double point.\n        *   The arithmetic genus of this component is $p_a(C_2) = \\lfloor (\\deg - 1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n        *   The normalization of this curve is $z^2 = x'^3+x'^2+1$, which is an elliptic curve (genus 1), so the geometric genus of $C_2$ is $g(C_2)=1$.\n        *   The difference $p_a(C_2) - g(C_2) = 2-1=1$ corresponds to the \"severity\" ($\\delta$-invariant) of the cusp.\n\n5.  **Construct the Stable Model and Count Double Points:**\n    The special fiber of the minimal regular model, $C_s = C_1 \\cup C_2$, is not the stable reduction because it contains a cusp. A stable curve can only have nodes (ordinary double points) as singularities.\n    The stable model $C_{st}$ is obtained by modifying $C_s$:\n    *   The cuspidal component $C_2$ is replaced by a new configuration that is stable. This involves taking its normalization (the elliptic curve $C_2^{norm}$) and adding nodes to compensate for the drop in arithmetic genus.\n    *   The genus drop is $p_a(C_2) - g(C_2^{norm}) = 2 - 1 = 1$. This means one node must be created. This is achieved by making the elliptic curve intersect itself at one point.\n    *   So, the stable model $C_{st}$ consists of:\n        1.  The component $C_1$, which is a smooth rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n        2.  A new component $C'_2$, which is an elliptic curve with one self-intersection node.\n        3.  These two components still intersect at one point, corresponding to the vertex of the Newton polygon.\n    Now, we count the double points (nodes) in the stable model $C_{st}$:\n    *   One node from the self-intersection of the elliptic curve component ($C'_2$).\n    *   One node from the intersection of the two components ($C_1$ and $C'_2$).\n    Total number of double points = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n6.  **Final Consistency Check:**\n    The arithmetic genus of the resulting stable model must be 2.\n    $p_a(C_{st}) = p_a(C_1) + p_a(C'_2) + (\\text{intersections}) - 1$.\n    $p_a(C_1)=0$. $p_a(C'_2) = g(C'_2) + \\delta(C'_2) = 1+1=2$.\n    $p_a(C_{st}) = 0 + 2 + 1 - 1 = 2$.\n    This matches the genus of the original curve, so the analysis is consistent.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve has 2 double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
