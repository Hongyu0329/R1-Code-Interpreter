    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to find the next letter.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial sequence**\nThe sequence of letters given is `ZXXCVYBN_`. We need to determine the 9th letter.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple pattern**\nThe letters do not follow a standard alphabetical order (neither forward nor backward). A simple skip-letter pattern also does not fit. For example, the distance between Z and X is 2 letters, but between X and X is 0. This suggests a more complex pattern is at play.\n\n**Step 3: Consider an external context**\nPuzzles of this nature often refer to an external, commonly known structure. The letters Z, X, C, V, B, N are all found on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\nThe bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard is: `Z X C V B N M`\n\n**Step 4: Identify the underlying structure of the sequence**\nThe given sequence `ZXXCVYBN` is not a direct copy of the keyboard row. It contains an extra 'X' and a 'Y' which is not on the bottom row. This suggests that the main sequence might be combined with another, or that there are two separate sequences interleaved.\n\nLet's test the interleaved sequence hypothesis. We can split the sequence into two sub-sequences based on their positions (odd or even):\n*   **Sequence 1 (Odd positions: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, ...):** Z, X, V, B, _\n*   **Sequence 2 (Even positions: 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, ...):** X, C, Y, N\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the relevant sub-sequence**\nThe question asks for the next letter, which is the 9th letter in the original sequence. This corresponds to the 5th letter in Sequence 1. So, we need to find the pattern in `Z, X, V, B, _`.\n\nLet's look at these letters on the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard (`Z X C V B N M`):\n*   The first letter is `Z`.\n*   The second letter is `X`.\n*   The sequence then skips the next letter on the keyboard, which is `C`.\n*   The third letter is `V`.\n*   The fourth letter is `B`.\n\nThe pattern for Sequence 1 emerges: **Take two consecutive letters from the keyboard's bottom row, then skip the next letter.**\n*   **Take:** `Z`, `X`\n*   **Skip:** `C`\n*   **Take:** `V`, `B`\n\n**Step 6: Apply the pattern to find the next letter**\nTo find the next letter in Sequence 1, we continue the pattern:\n*   After taking `V` and `B`, the pattern tells us to **skip** the next letter on the keyboard row, which is `N`.\n*   After skipping `N`, we **take** the next letter, which is `M`.\n\nTherefore, the next letter in Sequence 1 is `M`. This will be the 9th letter in the original sequence. The pattern in Sequence 2 (X, C, Y, N) is not needed to solve for the 9th position.\n\n<<<M>>>"
