    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key detail is that this character expresses a specific feeling—shame—about missing a particular sound from Earth: the rustling of leaves.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Roles**\nWe need to consider the personality and primary concerns of each character listed in the answer choices within the context of the film.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins with him on Earth, surrounded by nature. He is deeply connected to his memories of Earth and his past. While he certainly misses Earth, the specific line about being \"ashamed\" to miss the rustling leaves is not his. His emotional journey is more focused on his relationship with the \"guest\" version of his dead wife, Hari.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is not a human from Earth but a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories created by the Solaris ocean. She has no memories of Earth herself, so she cannot miss something she has never experienced. Her struggle is with her own unnatural existence.\n*   **C. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is world-weary, cynical, and highly philosophical. He often engages Kris in long conversations about the nature of humanity, science, and their predicament. He acts as a kind of weary guide, lamenting their loss of human connection.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** The other scientist. He is cold, rational, and almost obsessively focused on the scientific aspects of their situation. He suppresses emotion and would see missing something \"sentimental\" like rustling leaves as a weakness. It is highly out of character for him to admit such a feeling, let alone shame over it.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A friend of Kris and the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video recording he left behind. In the video, he is distressed and warns Kris, but he does not have a conversation where he could express this specific sentiment.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThe line in question is a key piece of dialogue that reveals the deep-seated homesickness and loss of humanity felt by the crew. During a philosophical conversation with Kris in the station's library, it is Dr. Snaut who makes this confession. He is trying to explain the psychological toll of being so far from home, confronted by something incomprehensible. He says something to the effect of: \"I'm ashamed to admit this, Kris, but I miss the sound of rustling leaves.\" This admission of a seemingly trivial, sentimental longing—and the shame associated with it—perfectly encapsulates his character's internal conflict and the film's theme of humanity's fragile connection to its terrestrial roots.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the character analysis and recall of the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves.\n\n<<<C>>>"
