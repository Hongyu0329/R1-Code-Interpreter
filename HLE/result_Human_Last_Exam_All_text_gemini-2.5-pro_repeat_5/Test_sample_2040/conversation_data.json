    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC):**\n    SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In SPDC, a high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). For this process to occur, two fundamental conditions must be met:\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The energy of the pump photon must equal the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons ($E_{pump} = E_{signal} + E_{idler}$).\n    *   **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** The momentum of the pump photon must equal the sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons ($\\vec{k}_{pump} = \\vec{k}_{signal} + \\vec{k}_{idler}$).\n\n2.  **Material Requirements for SPDC:**\n    For a material to facilitate SPDC, it must possess specific properties:\n    *   **Non-zero Second-Order Nonlinear Susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$):** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process. Its existence and strength are governed by the material's $\\chi^{(2)}$ tensor. In the bulk electric dipole approximation, a material must be non-centrosymmetric (lack a center of inversion symmetry) to have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n    *   **Optical Transparency:** The material must be relatively transparent at the wavelengths of the pump, signal, and idler photons. If the material strongly absorbs light at these wavelengths, the photons will be absorbed rather than participating in the SPDC process, quenching the effect.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Properties of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):**\n    *   **Crystal Symmetry:** Boron nanosheets, or borophene, can exist in several different atomic arrangements called polymorphs. The most commonly studied and synthesized forms, such as the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases, have crystal structures that are **centrosymmetric**. Based on bulk material rules, a centrosymmetric crystal should have $\\chi^{(2)} = 0$.\n    *   **The 2D Material Exception:** A careful point to consider is that this rule can be broken in 2D materials. Even if the 2D crystal lattice is centrosymmetric (like graphene or the common borophene phases), a single, isolated sheet in 3D space inherently lacks inversion symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the plane. This symmetry breaking can lead to a non-zero surface $\\chi^{(2)}$ response. Theoretical calculations indeed predict that borophene should possess a large $\\chi^{(2)}$, potentially even larger than that of well-known non-centrosymmetric 2D materials like molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$). So, from this perspective alone, SPDC might seem possible.\n    *   **Electronic Properties and Optical Absorption:** This is the most critical point. Borophene is fundamentally **metallic**. Metallic materials contain a high density of free charge carriers (electrons). These free electrons interact very strongly with light, leading to high optical absorption and reflection across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum (including the visible and near-infrared regions where SPDC experiments are typically performed).\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Analysis to Reach a Conclusion:**\n    We must weigh the two competing factors: the presence of a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ and the strong metallic absorption.\n    *   The non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ suggests that the fundamental nonlinear interaction required for SPDC is, in principle, allowed.\n    *   However, the metallic nature of borophene means that it is highly absorbing. An incident pump photon is far more likely to be absorbed by the material (transferring its energy to the electrons and lattice, ultimately generating heat) than it is to undergo the much rarer SPDC process.\n    *   Furthermore, even if a rare SPDC event were to occur and a signal-idler pair was generated, these lower-energy photons would be created within a highly absorbing medium and would have an extremely high probability of being immediately re-absorbed before they could escape and be detected.\n\n### Careful Points to List\n\n1.  **Symmetry Distinction:** It is crucial to distinguish between the centrosymmetric nature of the 2D *crystal lattice* of borophene and the non-centrosymmetric nature of a single 2D *sheet* in 3D space. The latter allows for a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  **Necessary vs. Sufficient Conditions:** Possessing a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ is a necessary condition for SPDC, but it is not sufficient. Transparency is also a critical requirement.\n3.  **Dominant Process:** In any light-matter interaction, multiple processes compete. In a metal, linear absorption is the dominant process, and it would overwhelm the very inefficient nonlinear process of SPDC.\n4.  **Practical Expectation:** The question asks if SPDC would be \"expected to\" occur. This implies a consideration of practical observability and efficiency, not just theoretical possibility. Due to the overwhelming absorption, the quantum efficiency would be vanishingly small, so the phenomenon would not be expected to be observed.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile free-standing boron nanosheets are predicted to have a large second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) due to their 2D structure, their inherent metallic character results in strong optical absorption. This high absorption would quench the SPDC process, making both the initial downconversion of pump photons and the escape of any generated signal/idler photons extremely unlikely. Therefore, boron nanosheets would not be expected to be a suitable material for exhibiting spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n<<<No>>>"
