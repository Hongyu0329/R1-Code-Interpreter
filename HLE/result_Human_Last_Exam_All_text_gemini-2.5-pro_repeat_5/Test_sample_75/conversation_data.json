    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Start and End Points of the Second Great War**\n\nThe Second Great War is the primary conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy and its epilogue. To calculate its duration, we must identify its official start and end dates in the lore's timeline.\n\n*   **Start of the War:** The war officially begins with the renewed Zerg Swarm invasion of the Koprulu Sector, led by the Queen of Blades. This event is the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign, specifically the attack on the planet Mar Sara. According to the official timeline, this occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n*   **End of the War:** The conclusion of the war is the final defeat of its ultimate architect, the dark god Amon. While Amon's physical host is destroyed at the end of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* during the reclamation of Aiur (year 2506), Amon himself is not vanquished. The true end of the war comes in the *Into the Void* epilogue campaign, where the united Terran, Protoss, and Zerg forces travel into the Void to destroy Amon's essence permanently. This final victory occurs in the year **2508**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Duration**\n\nWith the start and end years established, we can calculate the total time span of the conflict.\n\n*   Start Year: 2504\n*   End Year: 2508\n*   Duration = End Year - Start Year\n*   Duration = 2508 - 2504 = 4 years\n\n**Step 3: Consider Careful Points and Nuances**\n\n1.  **Defining \"The War\":** It's crucial to include the *Into the Void* epilogue. The main campaigns (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, *Legacy of the Void*) span from 2504 to 2506. However, the lore explicitly states there is a two-year period of preparation after the battle for Aiur before the final assault on Amon in the Void. This preparation phase is a direct continuation of the war effort, making 2508 the correct end date for the entire conflict.\n\n2.  **Continuous Conflict:** The period from 2504 to 2508 represents a continuous state of war and preparation against a singular threat (Amon and his forces). The events are chronologically linked:\n    *   **2504:** *Wings of Liberty*\n    *   **2505:** *Heart of the Swarm*\n    *   **2506:** *Legacy of the Void*\n    *   **2506-2508:** Preparation for the final battle\n    *   **2508:** *Into the Void* (Epilogue)\n\n3.  **Rounding Requirement:** The question asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   Our calculated duration is exactly 4 years based on the start and end years.\n    *   Rounding up a whole number does not change its value. Therefore, rounding 4 up results in 4.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, the Second Great War started in 2504 and concluded in 2508. The total duration is 4 years. Rounding this number up as requested still yields 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
