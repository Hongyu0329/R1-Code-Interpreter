To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape. At sunrise, when exposed to the UV light in sunlight, the table must bend from a relatively straight configuration (the *trans* form) into a bent or V-shape configuration (the *cis* form). At sunset, in the dark, it must relax back to its original straight configuration (the *trans* form).
