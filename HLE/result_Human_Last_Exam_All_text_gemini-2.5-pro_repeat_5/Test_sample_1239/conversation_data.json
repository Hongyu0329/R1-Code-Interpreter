    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the equations**\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) describe the evolution of a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and a pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$. The equations are:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, and we have set the constant density $\\rho=1$ without loss of generality (as it can be absorbed into the pressure term). We are looking for the Lie group of point transformations of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that leave the form of this system of partial differential equations invariant. The dimension of the group is the number of independent parameters in the most general such transformation, which is equivalent to the dimension of its Lie algebra.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the basic symmetries (The Galilean Group)**\nThe Navier-Stokes equations possess a set of \"obvious\" symmetries due to the fundamental principles of physics (homogeneity of time and space, isotropy of space, and Galilean relativity). These correspond to the following infinitesimal generators:\n*   **Time translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$). This gives one generator: $\\partial_t$.\n    *   Dimension: 1\n*   **Space translations:** The equations are homogeneous in space (no explicit dependence on $\\mathbf{x}$). This gives three generators, one for each spatial direction: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n*   **Spatial rotations:** The equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations of the coordinate system). The group of rotations in 3D is $SO(3)$. This gives three generators for rotations about the three coordinate axes, of the form $x_i \\partial_{x_j} - x_j \\partial_{x_i} + u_i \\partial_{u_j} - u_j \\partial_{u_i}$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n*   **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. This transformation is $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. This gives three generators, one for each direction of the boost velocity, of the form $t\\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$.\n    *   Dimension: 3\n\nThese symmetries together form a 10-dimensional Lie algebra, the Galilean algebra.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the scaling symmetry**\nThe Navier-Stokes equations admit a scaling (or dilation) symmetry. We look for a transformation of the form $t \\to \\alpha^a t, \\mathbf{x} \\to \\alpha^b \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u} \\to \\alpha^c \\mathbf{u}, p \\to \\alpha^d p$. For the equations to remain invariant, the scaling exponents must satisfy a set of linear equations. For the Navier-Stokes equations, these relations fix the scaling to a single parameter. A common choice is:\n$\\mathbf{x} \\to \\alpha \\mathbf{x}$, $t \\to \\alpha^2 t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\alpha^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\alpha^{-2} p$.\nThis is a one-parameter group of transformations, adding one more dimension to the symmetry algebra. The corresponding infinitesimal generator is $2t\\partial_t + x_j\\partial_{x_j} - u_j\\partial_{u_j} - 2p\\partial_p$.\n*   Dimension: 1\n\nSo far, we have found $10 + 1 = 11$ dimensions.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the pressure symmetry**\nThe pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This term is invariant under the transformation $p \\to p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time. This is a symmetry of the equations. The infinitesimal generators for these symmetries are of the form $h(t)\\partial_p$ for any smooth function $h(t)$. Since $h(t)$ is an arbitrary function, it can be represented by an infinite number of independent basis functions (e.g., a Taylor or Fourier series), which means this symmetry corresponds to an infinite-dimensional abelian ideal in the full symmetry algebra.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the question and determine the final dimension**\nThe question asks for \"the dimension\", which implies a finite number. When a system of differential equations has an infinite-dimensional symmetry group, this question is conventionally interpreted as asking for the dimension of the **maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra** of the full symmetry algebra.\n\nThe full algebra is a semidirect product of the 11-dimensional algebra found in Steps 2 & 3 ($L_{11}$) and the infinite-dimensional algebra of pressure shifts $A = \\{h(t)\\partial_p\\}$. A finite-dimensional subalgebra can only contain a finite-dimensional subspace of $A$. For this subspace to be compatible with the whole $L_{11}$ algebra, it must be invariant under the action of $L_{11}$. Analysis of the commutation relations shows that the only such invariant subspace that doesn't lead to an infinite tower of larger finite-dimensional algebras is the one-dimensional space of constant functions.\n\nTherefore, we restrict the arbitrary function $h(t)$ to be a constant, $h(t)=c$. This corresponds to the symmetry $p \\to p+c$, which has the single infinitesimal generator $\\partial_p$. Adding this to the 11 generators found previously results in a consistent, 12-dimensional Lie algebra.\n\nThe final dimension is the sum of the dimensions from each type of symmetry:\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Constant pressure shift: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nThis 12-dimensional algebra is widely cited as the result for this problem.\n\n<<<12>>>"
