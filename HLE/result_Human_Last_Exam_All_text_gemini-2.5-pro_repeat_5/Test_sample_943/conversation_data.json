    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Tensor:**\n    The problem asks for the slice rank of a tensor $T$ defined by the function\n    $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$\n    where $x, y, z$ are vectors in $\\{0, 1\\}^n$. The codomain is $\\mathbb{C}$.\n    The tensor lives in the space $V \\otimes V \\otimes V$, where $V$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. The space $V$ has dimension $2^n$.\n\n2.  **Decompose the Tensor:**\n    Let's analyze the structure of the tensor. It is composed of two parts: a product term and a constant term.\n    Let $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\n    Let $C(x, y, z) = 1$.\n    So, $T = P - C$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Term:**\n    The product term $P(x,y,z)$ is a tensor product of $n$ smaller tensors.\n    Let $T_1$ be the base tensor defined on $\\{0,1\\} \\times \\{0,1\\} \\times \\{0,1\\}$ by\n    $T_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$.\n    Then $P$ is the $n$-th tensor power of $T_1$, i.e., $P = T_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n    So, $T = T_1^{\\otimes n} - C$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Constant Term:**\n    The constant term $C(x, y, z) = 1$ is a rank-1 tensor. It can be written as $C(x,y,z) = f(x)g(y)h(z)$ where $f, g, h$ are the constant functions that map any input to 1. As a rank-1 tensor, its slice rank is 1.\n\n5.  **Relate the Slice Ranks:**\n    The slice rank is subadditive, $SR(A+B) \\le SR(A) + SR(B)$, and also satisfies the triangle inequality $SR(A) \\ge |SR(A-B) - SR(B)|$.\n    Let $SR(T)$ be the slice rank of the tensor $T$.\n    $SR(T) = SR(T_1^{\\otimes n} - C) \\le SR(T_1^{\\otimes n}) + SR(C) = SR(T_1^{\\otimes n}) + 1$.\n    $SR(T_1^{\\otimes n}) = SR(T + C) \\le SR(T) + SR(C) = SR(T) + 1$.\n    Thus, $|SR(T) - SR(T_1^{\\otimes n})| \\le 1$.\n    The given slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$, which grows exponentially. Adding or subtracting 1 does not change the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank. Therefore, we can analyze the slice rank of $T_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n    $SR(T) \\approx SR(T_1^{\\otimes n})$.\n\n6.  **Slice Rank of a Tensor Power:**\n    A key property of the slice rank is its multiplicativity with respect to the tensor product: $SR(A \\otimes B) = SR(A) SR(B)$. A more general statement is that for any tensor $A$, $SR(A^{\\otimes n}) = (SR(A))^n$.\n    Therefore, $SR(T_1^{\\otimes n}) = (SR(T_1))^n$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Slice Rank of the Base Tensor $T_1$:**\n    The base tensor $T_1$ is a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor with entries $T_1(i, j, k) = i + j + k$ for $i, j, k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    Let's write out its slices along the first dimension (indexed by $i$).\n    For $i=0$: $S_0 = T_1(0,:,:) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    For $i=1$: $S_1 = T_1(1,:,:) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The slice rank is the minimum number of slices (tensors of the form $u \\otimes A$ or $B \\otimes v$ or $C \\otimes w$) that sum to $T_1$.\n    We can express $T_1$ as a sum of two slices along the first dimension:\n    $T_1 = \\delta_0 \\otimes S_0 + \\delta_1 \\otimes S_1$, where $\\delta_0=(1,0)^T$ and $\\delta_1=(0,1)^T$.\n    This shows that the slice rank is at most 2, i.e., $SR(T_1) \\le 2$.\n    To check if the slice rank is 1, we must check if $T_1$ can be represented as a single slice. For example, if $T_1 = u \\otimes A$, its slices $T_1(i,:,:)$ must be proportional.\n    $S_1$ is not a scalar multiple of $S_0$ because $1 = \\lambda \\cdot 0$ is impossible. By symmetry, $T_1$ cannot be represented as a single slice along any axis.\n    Therefore, $SR(T_1) > 1$.\n    Combining the bounds, we find that the slice rank of the base tensor is exactly 2: $SR(T_1) = 2$.\n\n8.  **Determine the Asymptotic Slice Rank:**\n    Using the results from the previous steps:\n    $SR(T) \\approx SR(T_1^{\\otimes n}) = (SR(T_1))^n = 2^n$.\n    The asymptotic behavior of the slice rank is $2^n$.\n\n9.  **Solve for K:**\n    The problem states that the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\n    We equate the base of the exponential growth from our derivation with the given one. The $e^{o(n)}$ term represents sub-exponential factors, which do not affect the base.\n    $2^n \\approx (3/2^K)^n$\n    Taking the $n$-th root on both sides, we get:\n    $2 = 3/2^K$\n    Now, we solve for $K$:\n    $2 \\cdot 2^K = 3$\n    $2^{K+1} = 3$\n    $K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n    $K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\n    Using logarithm properties, this can be written as:\n    $K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   The slice rank property $SR(A^{\\otimes n}) = (SR(A))^n$ is crucial and holds over any field. This ensures that the asymptotic slice rank is simply the slice rank of the base tensor.\n*   The difference between rank and slice rank. Here we only needed slice rank.\n*   The asymptotic equality $SR(T) \\approx SR(T_1^{\\otimes n})$ is justified because the difference is a tensor of slice rank 1, which is negligible compared to the exponential growth.\n*   The calculation of $SR(T_1)=2$ is sound and based on the definition of slice rank.\n*   The final expression for $K$ is unusual for a typical competition problem but is the direct consequence of a rigorous derivation. There is no indication in the problem that suggests a simpler integer or rational answer for K.\n\nFinal result calculation:\n$K = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\n>>>log_2(3/2)"
