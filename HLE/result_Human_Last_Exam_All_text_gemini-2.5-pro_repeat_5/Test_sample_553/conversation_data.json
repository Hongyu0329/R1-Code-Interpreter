    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question**\n\n*   **The Beatles:** The band whose discography we need to search.\n*   **Starts with:** The chord progression must be the very first thing you hear in the song, i.e., the introduction.\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. It's built on the first note of the scale. We label it with the Roman numeral 'I' if it's a major chord or 'i' if it's a minor chord.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This is the crucial part. The \"fifth\" refers to the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n    *   In a standard major key, the chord on the fifth degree is a *major* chord (labeled 'V'). For example, in the key of A Major, the V chord is E Major.\n    *   A \"minor fifth chord\" (labeled 'v') is a minor chord built on that same fifth note. Using our example, in the key of A Major, the v chord would be E minor. This is a less common but very effective choice, often borrowed from the parallel minor key (A minor) in a technique called \"modal interchange\".\n*   **The Progression:** The question asks for a song that starts with a jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth (v). So we are looking for a I -> v progression at the beginning of a song.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nWe need to think of Beatles songs and their opening chords.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a single, famous, and complex dissonant chord. It's not a I -> v progression.\n*   **\"Help!\":** The vocal starts first. The band enters with a Bm -> G -> E7 -> A progression. If we consider the key to be A Major, this starts on the 'ii' chord (B minor), not the tonic.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** This song is in A minor. The verse progression begins Am -> Em. This is a 'i' (minor tonic) to 'v' (minor fifth) progression. However, the song starts with a few loud, jarring A minor chords before the verse begins. While it contains the progression, it doesn't *start* with the jump itself in the way the question implies.\n*   **\"I Feel Fine\":** Starts with feedback, then a guitar riff over a I - IV - V progression (in G Major). The V chord is D Major, not minor.\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\":** Let's analyze this song from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n    *   The song begins immediately with a strummed acoustic guitar.\n    *   The very first chord is **A Major**. This is our tonic chord (I).\n    *   The very next chord is **E minor**. In the key of A, the fifth degree is E. A minor chord on E is the \"minor fifth\" (v).\n    *   The progression is **A Major -> E minor**, which is precisely **I -> v**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the Analysis**\n\nThe song \"I'll Be Back\" starts with the exact chord progression described in the question. The jump from the bright A Major tonic chord to the unexpectedly somber E minor chord is what gives the song's introduction its unique, wistful, and melancholic character. No other famous Beatles song begins so clearly and immediately with this specific I -> v chord change.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
