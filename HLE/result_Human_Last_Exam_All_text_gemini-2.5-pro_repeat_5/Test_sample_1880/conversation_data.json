    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of a reducible polynomial is smaller and has a different structure than that of an irreducible one.\n\n1.  **Rational Root Theorem:** We test for rational roots, which must be integer divisors of the constant term 14. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $P(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(2) = 16 + 16 + 14 = 46 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Testing the other divisors also yields non-zero results. Thus, $P(x)$ has no linear factors.\n\n2.  **Quadratic Factors:** If $P(x)$ is reducible, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials. By Gauss's Lemma, we can assume these factors have integer coefficients:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$\n    Expanding the right side and comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$:\n    *   Coefficient of $x^3$: $a + c = 0 \\implies c = -a$.\n    *   Coefficient of $x^2$: $b + d + ac = b + d - a^2 = 0 \\implies b + d = a^2$.\n    *   Coefficient of $x$: $ad + bc = ad - ab = a(d-b) = 8$.\n    *   Constant term: $bd = 14$.\n\n    From $bd=14$, the possible integer pairs for $(b,d)$ are $(1,14), (-1,-14), (2,7), (-2,-7)$ and their reverses. We check each case:\n    *   If $(b,d) = (2,7)$, then $b+d = 9$. So $a^2=9 \\implies a=\\pm 3$.\n        *   If $a=3$, then $a(d-b) = 3(7-2) = 15 \\neq 8$.\n        *   If $a=-3$, then $a(d-b) = -3(7-2) = -15 \\neq 8$.\n    *   Testing other pairs for $(b,d)$ similarly shows that no integer solutions for $a$ exist.\n\nSince $P(x)$ has no linear or quadratic factors, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Discriminant\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of the polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\nTo check if 591872 is a perfect square, we can look at its last digit (2), which means it cannot be a perfect square. Alternatively, we can factor it: $591872 = 2 \\cdot 295936 = 2 \\cdot 544^2$.\nSince $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates the possibilities $G \\cong A_4$ (order 12) and $G \\cong V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4). The remaining possibilities for a transitive group are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we use the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, one form of the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nThe structure of the Galois group depends on the reducibility of $R(y)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n*   If $R(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G \\cong S_4$.\n*   If $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G$ is a smaller group ($D_4$ or $C_4$).\n\nWe test for rational roots of $R(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are divisors of -64.\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The Galois group must be $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nThe final step is to determine whether the order of the group is 8 or 4. This can be determined by analyzing the degree of the splitting field of the polynomial.\nLet $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 544^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is the splitting field of the resolvent cubic $R(y)$, as its roots are $8$ and $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe splitting field of the original polynomial $P(x)$ is $K = L(\\sqrt{-y_1}, \\sqrt{-y_2}, \\sqrt{-y_3})$, where $y_i$ are the roots of the resolvent.\n$K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-8}, \\sqrt{4-2\\sqrt{2}})$.\nThe order of the Galois group is the degree of this extension, $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nWe have the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset L \\subset K$. The degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:L][L:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nWe know $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\nNow we determine $[K:L]$. $K = L(\\sqrt{-8}, \\sqrt{4-2\\sqrt{2}})$. By Kummer theory, the degree of this biquadratic extension is 4, unless one of the elements $-8$, $4-2\\sqrt{2}$, or their product $-8(4-2\\sqrt{2})$ is a perfect square in $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n1.  Is $-8$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? No, because $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of the real numbers, and $-8$ is negative.\n2.  Is $4-2\\sqrt{2}$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Let $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4-2\\sqrt{2}$ for $u,v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This leads to the equation $u^4-4u^2+2=0$ for $u$, which has no rational solutions. So it is not a square.\n3.  Is $-32+16\\sqrt{2}$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Similarly, this leads to an equation for the rational part that has no solutions.\n\nSince none of these conditions are met, the extension $K/L$ is a biquadratic extension of degree 4.\nTherefore, the degree of the splitting field is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:L][L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is the degree of the splitting field.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe order of the Galois group is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
