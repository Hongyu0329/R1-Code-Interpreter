    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Function:**\n    The algorithm converts a non-negative integer `n` into its base `c` representation. It uses the standard method of repeatedly dividing the number by the base `c` and recording the remainders. The remainders, in reverse order of calculation, form the digits of the number in the new base.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Step of the Algorithm:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization**\n        *   `i := 0;`\n        *   `x := n;`\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`\n        *   `a_{0} := x — qc;`\n        This block involves a fixed number of basic operations: assignments, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. Assuming these operations take a constant amount of time, the time complexity of Step 1 is constant, which we denote as **O(1)**.\n\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n        This is the core of the algorithm. Its total time complexity is the number of times the loop runs multiplied by the time taken for each iteration.\n\n        *   **Time per Iteration:** Inside the loop, the following operations are performed:\n            *   `i := i + 1;` (constant time)\n            *   `x := q;` (constant time)\n            *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (constant time, assuming division is a basic operation)\n            *   `a_{i} := x — qc;` (constant time, one multiplication and one subtraction)\n            The work done inside a single iteration is constant. Let's call this cost `C`, which is **O(1)**.\n\n        *   **Number of Iterations:** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace the value of the variable `x` (which is assigned from `q`).\n            *   Before the loop starts, `x` is `n`.\n            *   After the first iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`.\n            *   After the second iteration, `x` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n            *   After `k` iterations, `x` becomes `⌊n/cᵏ⌋`.\n            The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `x` becomes small enough that `⌊x/c⌋` is 0. This occurs when `x < c`. The value of `x` is effectively being divided by `c` in each iteration. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is less than 1 is given by `log_c(n)`. Therefore, the number of loop iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times (for `n ≥ c`). The number of iterations is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n        *   **Total Time for the Loop:**\n            (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration) = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Return**\n        *   `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1} a_{0}))`\n        This step involves returning the sequence of calculated digits. The number of digits is `i+1`, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The time to construct and return this sequence is proportional to the number of digits, so it is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n3.  **Combine the Complexities:**\n    The total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n    T(n) = (Time for Step 1) + (Time for Step 2) + (Time for Step 3)\n    T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(log_c(n))\n    The dominant term is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Finalize the Expression:**\n    In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is usually omitted because logarithms of different bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`). Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Dominant Operation:** The `while` loop is the dominant part of the algorithm, as its execution count depends on the magnitude of the input `n`. The initialization and return steps are either constant or have a complexity tied to the number of loop iterations.\n*   **Loop Termination:** The crucial observation is that the value controlling the loop (`q`, which comes from `x`) is reduced by a constant factor (`c`) in each iteration. Such a process is always logarithmic in nature.\n*   **Cost of Arithmetic:** We assume standard integer arithmetic, where operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division take constant time. If `n` were large enough to require arbitrary-precision arithmetic, the complexity of these operations would also depend on `log(n)`, and the overall complexity would be higher (e.g., `O((log n)²)`, depending on the multiplication/division algorithm used). However, for typical algorithm analysis, the constant-time assumption is standard.\n*   **Base of Logarithm:** In complexity analysis, `O(log_c(n))` is simplified to `O(log n)` because constant factors are ignored.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations in the `while` loop. In each iteration, the value of `x` is effectively divided by `c`. This process repeats until `x` is less than `c`. The number of times `n` can be divided by `c` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Since each iteration takes constant time, the total time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`, which is conventionally written as `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
