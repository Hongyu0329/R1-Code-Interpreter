**Appropriate Management Procedures:**
1.  **Immediate Medical Management:** Urgent referral to a physician to begin treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 7.5%) and stabilize her systemic health. This is the top priority.
2.  **Emergency Dental Management:**
    *   Thorough clinical and radiographic assessment to rule out alveolar fractures.
    *   Gentle debridement and irrigation of the sockets. Replantation of the avulsed teeth is contraindicated due to the 28-hour delay.
    *   Suturing of any soft tissue lacerations.
    *   Prescription of prophylactic antibiotics, analgesics, and confirmation of tetanus status.
3.  **Interim Prosthetic Management:** Fabrication of a temporary removable partial denture ("flipper") to restore aesthetics during the healing period (3-6 months).
4.  **Definitive Prosthetic Management:** After her diabetes is well-controlled and the ridge has healed, the most practical option would be a definitive Removable Partial Denture.

**Cells of Interest:**
The primary cells of interest regarding the avulsed teeth are the **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells**, which are now non-viable. For the healing process, the key cells are **osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and osteoclasts**, whose functions are all impaired by her uncontrolled diabetes.

**Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Type of Denture and Material:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)** made from a **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy** with acrylic resin teeth and base.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:** Left Second Premolar (#25) and Left Central Incisor (#21).
    *   **Secondary (Stabilizing) Abutments:** Teeth on the contralateral side, such as the Right Canine (#13) and Right First Premolar (#14).
    *   **Reason:** This selection provides broad distribution of forces for optimal **Support, Stability, and Retention**. Engaging teeth on the opposite side of the arch (**cross-arch stabilization**) is essential to counteract leveraging forces and stabilize the prosthesis, especially considering her Skeletal Class III profile.
