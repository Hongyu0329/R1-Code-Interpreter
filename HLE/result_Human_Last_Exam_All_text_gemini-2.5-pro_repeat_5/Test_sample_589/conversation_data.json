    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the query into key elements.**\nThe question asks for a specific Hollywood feature film with several distinct visual and plot-based cues:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm potential films based on keywords.**\nThe combination of \"teenager,\" \"pink,\" and \"bike\" is highly suggestive of 1980s teen movies, which often featured bold colors and themes of rebellion. The film title *Pretty in Pink* is an immediate and strong candidate due to the explicit color reference.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the leading candidate, *Pretty in Pink* (1986).**\n*   **Film Type & Production:** *Pretty in Pink* is a classic Hollywood feature film from 1986, produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures, which is a major film studio. This matches the first two criteria.\n*   **Character:** The film features several teenage main characters. While the protagonist is Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald), the scene in question involves her best friend, Duckie Dale, played by Jon Cryer. Duckie is a high school teenager. This matches the third criterion.\n*   **Object:** Duckie is well-known for his eccentric style, which includes his customized bicycle. The bike is a modified Schwinn that is distinctively pink (or a faded reddish-pink), fitting the \"pink bike\" description. This matches the fourth criterion.\n*   **Action:** There is a specific, memorable scene in the film where the wealthy antagonist, Steff (James Spader), is driving his convertible and taunting Duckie. In a moment of defiance, Duckie gets on his bike and pedals directly at Steff's oncoming car, playing a game of \"chicken\" before swerving away at the last second. This action perfectly matches the fifth and final criterion.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate other potential films and rule them out.**\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure* (1985):** Features a famous bike, but it's red, and the main character is an adult-child, not a teenager.\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** Features iconic bike scenes, but none are pink, and the children fly *over* a roadblock, not *at* a single oncoming car in defiance.\n*   ***Napoleon Dynamite* (2004):** Napoleon rides a bike, but it is not pink, and there is no scene where he pedals toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nThe 1986 film *Pretty in Pink* meets all the specific conditions outlined in the question. The scene involves the character Duckie, a teenager, riding his famous pink bike directly toward a car driven by the antagonist, Steff.\n\n<<<Pretty in Pink>>>"
