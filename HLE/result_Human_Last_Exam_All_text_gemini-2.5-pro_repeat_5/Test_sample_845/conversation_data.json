    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Track HR (Heart Rate) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability).\n    *   **Methodology:** Capturing \"beat-to-beat intervals\" using PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n    *   **Key Question:** HRV is computed as a value *between* heartbeats. What is that fundamental value called?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Concepts:**\n    *   **Heartbeat:** A single contraction of the heart.\n    *   **Beat-to-beat interval:** This is the literal time duration from one heartbeat to the very next one. It is not constant; it varies slightly with every beat.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability):** This is not a single value but a measure of the *variation* in these beat-to-beat intervals over time. For example, if your intervals are 800ms, 810ms, 795ms, 805ms, there is variability. If they were all exactly 800ms, there would be no variability.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This is the technology used by smartwatches and fitness trackers. It shines a light into your skin and measures the change in light absorption, which corresponds to the pulsing of blood with each heartbeat. The time between these detected pulses is the beat-to-beat interval.\n\n3.  **Connect the Concepts to Find the Term:**\n    *   The question asks for the name of the time measured between consecutive heartbeats. This interval is the raw data from which all HRV metrics are calculated.\n    *   In the medical and scientific field, especially when originating from ECG (Electrocardiogram) data, the most prominent peak of a heartbeat's electrical signal is called the \"R-wave\". Therefore, the time interval between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   Although PPG measures blood volume pulse and not the electrical R-wave, the term **R-R interval** has become the industry standard and is used ubiquitously to refer to the beat-to-beat interval, even when derived from PPG.\n    *   A more general, and also very common, term is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. This term is technically more accurate for non-ECG sources like PPG but is often used interchangeably with R-R interval.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **PPG vs. ECG:** The term \"R-R interval\" originates from ECG. PPG measures the pulse-to-pulse (P-P) interval. However, in the context of HRV, the data from PPG is used as a surrogate for ECG data, so the term \"R-R interval\" is widely adopted.\n*   **HR vs. HRV:** Heart Rate (HR) is typically an average (e.g., 60 beats *per minute*), while HRV looks at the precise time of each individual interval (e.g., 1.0 seconds, 0.98 seconds, 1.03 seconds). The value in question is this precise interval, measured in milliseconds (ms).\n*   **Raw Data vs. Metric:** The R-R interval (or IBI) is the raw data point. HRV metrics (like SDNN or RMSSD) are statistical calculations performed on a series of these R-R intervals. The question asks for the name of the raw data point itself.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats, which serves as the fundamental data for calculating HRV, is called the **R-R interval** or **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. Both terms are correct and widely used.\n\n<<<R-R interval (or Inter-Beat Interval, IBI)"
