    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron and the Setup\n*   **Icosahedron:** An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   **Symmetry:** A key property of a regular icosahedron is its high degree of symmetry. It has a center of symmetry (also called a center of inversion), meaning for any point inside or on the surface, there is an identical point on the opposite side an equal distance from the center.\n*   **Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base. Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, there is an identical triangular face perfectly parallel to the base at the very top of the tank.\n*   **Vertical Axis:** The line passing through the geometric centers of the bottom and top faces is vertical. This line is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry (rotating the icosahedron by 120° or 240° around this axis leaves it looking unchanged).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Location of the Water Surface\n*   **Half-Filled Condition:** The tank is \"half-filled with water,\" which means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   **Water Surface Plane:** Assuming the tank is on level ground, the surface of the water will be a flat, horizontal plane.\n*   **Using Symmetry to Find the Plane:** Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, any plane passing through this center divides the icosahedron's volume into two equal halves. Since the water volume is half the total volume and its surface is horizontal, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Water Surface\n*   **Cross-Section:** The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by cutting the icosahedron with this central horizontal plane.\n*   **Using Symmetry to Find the Shape:** We can determine the shape of this cross-section by considering the symmetries of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n    1.  **Rotational Symmetry:** As established in Step 1, the vertical axis is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. The water surface plane is perpendicular to this axis. Therefore, the shape of the cross-section must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means it must look the same after being rotated by 120°.\n    2.  **Central Symmetry:** The water surface plane passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry. Therefore, the cross-sectional shape must also be centrally symmetric (for every point on its perimeter, there is a corresponding point directly opposite through the center).\n*   **Number of Sides:** The perimeter of the cross-section is formed by the lines where the cutting plane intersects the faces of the icosahedron. Equivalently, the vertices of the cross-section are the points where the plane intersects the edges of the icosahedron. The central plane is located exactly halfway between the top and bottom of the icosahedron. It will intersect all the edges that cross this \"equator.\" In a face-up orientation, there are exactly 6 such edges that connect the 6 vertices in the top half of the icosahedron to the 6 vertices in the bottom half. Therefore, the cross-section is a polygon with 6 sides—a hexagon.\n*   **Putting it all together:** The shape is a hexagon that must have both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry. A hexagon with these combined symmetries must be a **regular hexagon** (all sides are equal in length, and all internal angles are equal).\n\n### Final Conclusion\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled, the water surface forms a horizontal plane through the center of the icosahedron. The cross-section of the icosahedron at this plane is a regular hexagon.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   Do not confuse the orientation. An icosahedron standing on a vertex has a different cross-section (a decagon). The problem specifies it stands on a face.\n*   The \"half-filled\" condition is crucial, as it precisely locates the water surface at the center of the object due to symmetry.\n*   Relying on symmetry is the most direct way to solve this problem without needing complex coordinate geometry. The combination of 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry is sufficient to prove the hexagon is regular.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
