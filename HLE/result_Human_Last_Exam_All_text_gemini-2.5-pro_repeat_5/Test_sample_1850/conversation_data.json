    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Terms of the Question\n\n*   **\"Historical Saints\"**: This term typically refers to individuals who lived after the biblical era (i.e., post-Apostolic age) and were later canonized or widely venerated as saints, particularly within the Catholic or Orthodox traditions. This distinction is crucial because *Paradise Lost* is filled with biblical figures who are also considered saints (e.g., Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Peter, Paul, Mary). The question implies we should exclude these primary biblical characters and focus on figures from later church history.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The individual's name, or a clear derivative of it that unmistakably identifies them, must appear in the text of the poem. A general allusion to a group (like \"hermits and friars\") or an event (like the \"Constantinian donation\") without naming the person does not count.\n*   **\"Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: The search must be confined strictly to the text of this epic poem. References in Milton's other works are not relevant.\n\n### Step 2: Strategizing the Search\n\nGiven Milton's Protestant beliefs, he was often critical of the medieval Catholic Church and the veneration of saints, which he viewed as a form of \"works righteousness\" or idolatry. Therefore, any mention of historical saints is likely to be found in passages that are critical or satirical of the Catholic Church. The most probable locations for such references are:\n1.  Satirical digressions, where Milton comments on human folly.\n2.  The Archangel Michael's prophecy of future history to Adam in Books XI and XII, which includes a denunciation of the corruption of the Church.\n\n### Step 3: Searching the Text and Analyzing the Findings\n\nA thorough search of *Paradise Lost* reveals that mentions of historical, post-biblical saints are extremely rare. The primary instance occurs in Book III, in a satirical passage describing the \"Paradise of Fools\" (or Limbo of Vanity). This is a place on the outer edge of the universe where things and people associated with vanity and foolish presumption end up.\n\nIn this section, Milton describes a variety of misguided people, including Catholic monks and friars, who sought salvation through what he considered superstitious means. He writes:\n\n> And they who to be sure of Paradise,\n> Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**,\n> Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised;\n> (Book III, lines 478-480)\n\nHere, Milton explicitly names two historical saints:\n\n1.  **Dominic**: This is a direct reference to St. Dominic de Guzmán (c. 1170–1221), the Spanish priest who founded the Dominican Order (the Order of Preachers). Milton mocks the belief that dying in the habit (\"weeds\") of a Dominican friar could grant entry to heaven.\n2.  **Francis**: Milton uses the adjectival form \"Franciscan,\" which is an eponym directly referring to St. Francis of Assisi (c. 1181–1226), the founder of the Franciscan Order. The phrase \"in Franciscan [weeds]\" is parallel to \"weeds of Dominic\" and unambiguously refers to the order founded by St. Francis. Therefore, St. Francis is mentioned by name through this common derivative.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Absence of Other Saints\n\nA comprehensive search of the rest of the poem confirms the absence of other named historical saints.\n\n*   **Books XI and XII**: In Michael's vision of the future, he foretells the corruption of the Church by \"grievous wolves\" and alludes to the era of Emperor Constantine, but he never mentions Constantine, Augustine, Jerome, Benedict, Gregory, or any other major figure of the Patristic or Medieval periods by name. The prophecy remains general in its condemnation of post-biblical church history.\n*   **Other Books**: The remainder of the epic is focused on the celestial, infernal, and Edenic realms and the biblical narrative. There are no other contexts in which post-biblical saints are mentioned.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a careful analysis of the text of *Paradise Lost*, only two historical, post-biblical saints are mentioned by name. Both mentions occur in a single, satirical passage in Book III.\n\nThe two saints are:\n1.  **St. Dominic**\n2.  **St. Francis**\n\n<<<2>>>"
