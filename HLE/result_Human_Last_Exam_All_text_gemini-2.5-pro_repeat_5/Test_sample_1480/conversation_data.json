    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the \"rule activation level\" (also known as the firing strength or firing level) for a single fuzzy rule. This value represents the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the rule is satisfied by the current inputs.\n\n2.  **Identify the Antecedent Components:** The rule's antecedent consists of multiple conditions. We are given the membership values for two of these conditions:\n    *   The membership grade of input `x'` in the first fuzzy set is `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   The membership grade of input `y_j` in the second fuzzy set is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Logical Operator:** In a fuzzy rule like \"IF condition1 AND condition2 THEN...\", the logical \"AND\" connects the antecedent components. In fuzzy logic, this \"AND\" operation is implemented using a class of functions called **t-norms**. The question explicitly states to use a t-norm operation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Role of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\":**\n    *   A Type-1 fuzzy set uses a single number (e.g., 0.8) for a membership grade.\n    *   An Interval Type-2 fuzzy set uses an interval (e.g., [0.7, 0.9]) for a membership grade.\n    *   An Interval Type-3 (IT3) fuzzy set uses a more complex structure (a collection of interval type-2 sets) to represent even greater uncertainty about the membership grade.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** In a full IT3 Fuzzy Logic System, the inputs `Phi_k(x′)` and `μG_k_j(y_j)` would themselves be complex fuzzy sets, not single numbers. However, the question provides specific, crisp numerical values (`0.7` and `0.9`). This implies that we are calculating the activation level for a single, specific point or slice within the IT3 framework. Therefore, the complex theory of IT3 FS is context, but the calculation itself simplifies to operating on the given numbers. The fundamental principle of combining antecedent memberships with a t-norm remains the same.\n\n5.  **Select and Apply a Specific T-Norm:** The question specifies using a \"t-norm\" but doesn't state which one. The two most common t-norms used in fuzzy logic are:\n    *   **Minimum T-norm (Gödel t-norm):** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This is the most widely used and standard t-norm, especially when not specified otherwise.\n    *   **Product T-norm (Algebraic t-norm):** `T(a, b) = a * b`. This is another common choice.\n\n    Following standard convention, we will use the **minimum t-norm** for the calculation.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Inputs:** `a = 0.7` and `b = 0.9`.\n    *   **Operation:** `min(a, b)`.\n    *   **Result:** `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe rule activation level is the result of applying the t-norm to the membership grades of all parts of the rule's antecedent. Using the standard minimum t-norm on the provided values:\n\nActivation Level = `t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\nActivation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\nActivation Level = `0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
