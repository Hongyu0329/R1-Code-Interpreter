    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Establish the Base Health:**\n    First, we identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Normal Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, this value is **2,800 HP**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Expert Mode Health (Single Player):**\n    In Expert Mode, boss health is increased. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its health is multiplied by a factor of 1.3.\n    *   `2,800 (Normal Health) * 1.3 = 3,640 HP`\n    This is the baseline health for one player in Expert Mode.\n\n3.  **Determine the Multiplayer Scaling Formula:**\n    In Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player in the world. To find the exact formula, we can observe the health values for a small number of players:\n    *   **1 Player:** 3,640 HP\n    *   **2 Players:** 5,460 HP\n    *   **3 Players:** 7,280 HP\n\n    Now, let's calculate the health added for each additional player:\n    *   Health increase from 1 to 2 players: `5,460 - 3,640 = 1,820 HP`\n    *   Health increase from 2 to 3 players: `7,280 - 5,460 = 1,820 HP`\n\n    This reveals a constant, linear increase. For each player beyond the first, the Eye of Cthulhu gains exactly **1,820 HP**.\n    Therefore, the general formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health (`H`) for a given number of players (`N`) is:\n    `H(N) = 3,640 + (N - 1) * 1,820`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Limit for an Infinite Number of Players:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. Mathematically, we would take the limit of the function `H(N)` as `N` approaches infinity.\n    *   `lim (N→∞) [3,640 + (N - 1) * 1,820]`\n    Since this is a linear function that increases with `N`, the mathematical limit is infinity.\n\n5.  **Consider the Constraints of the Source Code:**\n    The prompt specifies that the answer should be based on the \"source code of the video game\". This means we must consider the technical limitations of the game engine. In Terraria, like many games, entity statistics such as health are stored using standard integer data types. Specifically, NPC health is stored as a **32-bit signed integer** (`int` in C#).\n\n6.  **Identify the Technical Limit:**\n    A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. This value represents the highest number that can be stored in the variable holding the NPC's health. Any calculation that exceeds this value would result in an overflow, but the `lifeMax` variable itself cannot be set higher than this limit.\n    The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is **2^31 - 1**.\n\n7.  **Acquire the Final Answer:**\n    Calculating the value:\n    *   `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,648 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`\n    Since the health formula increases indefinitely, the only effective ceiling is the maximum value of the data type used to store it. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2147483647}$."
