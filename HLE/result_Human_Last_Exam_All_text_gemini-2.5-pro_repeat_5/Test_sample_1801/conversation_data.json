    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two specific individuals.\n*   **What:** They are Nobel laureates.\n*   **Where:** Featured in a commercial for Enron.\n*   **When:** The year was 2000.\n*   **Key Detail:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign**\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a well-known, high-profile advertising series run by Enron to rebrand itself from a simple energy company to an innovative, forward-thinking global corporation. The campaign often featured intellectuals and thought leaders to bolster this image.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Individuals in the Commercials**\nResearching the cast of the \"Ask Why\" commercials reveals that several prominent figures were involved. A specific television spot featured two well-known economists discussing ideas, fitting the campaign's intellectual theme. These two economists were Merton Miller and Paul Krugman.\n\n**Step 4: Verify their Nobel Laureate Status (A Careful Point)**\nThis step is crucial for accuracy, as the timing of the Nobel Prize award is relevant.\n*   **Merton Miller:** He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for his work on the theory of finance. Therefore, at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n*   **Paul Krugman:** He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns. This means that in 2000, when he appeared in the commercial, he was a highly respected professor and economist but was not yet a Nobel laureate.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Answer**\nThe question asks which two \"Nobel laureates\" were featured. Although Paul Krugman received his prize after the commercial aired, he is now universally known as a Nobel laureate. Historical accounts of this infamous commercial refer to both men as Nobel laureates, as that is their current and most prominent title. Therefore, the correct answer identifies the two individuals who are known as Nobel laureates and appeared in that ad.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals featured in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial who are known as Nobel laureates are Merton Miller and Paul Krugman.\n\n<<<Merton Miller and Paul Krugman>>>"
