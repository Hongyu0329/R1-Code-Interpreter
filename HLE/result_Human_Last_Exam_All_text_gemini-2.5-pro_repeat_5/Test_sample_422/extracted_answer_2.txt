1.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress:** The "Justification" condition is problematic. For a belief to be justified enough to count as knowledge, its justification must be based on evidence that is itself known. Since the only available states are Belief and Knowledge, and mere Belief is too weak a foundation, the justification must be based on other Knowledge. This leads to an infinite regress, as each piece of known evidence requires its own justification based on further knowledge (`To know P, you must know E; to know E, you must know F...`), which is an impossible condition for any agent to meet.

2.  **The Problem of Categorical Incompatibility:** The premise that Knowledge and Belief are the two available epistemic states contradicts the structure of the JTB definition itself. The JTB theory defines Knowledge as a *subset* of Belief (a belief that is also true and justified). However, the problem's framing presents Knowledge and Belief as two distinct, alternative states. This creates a fundamental incompatibility: JTB requires that if one is in a state of Knowledge, one is also in a state of Belief, whereas the premise implies an agent is in either one state or the other, but not both.
