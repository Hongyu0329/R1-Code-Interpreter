    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific \"unique architectural feature\" with the following characteristics:\n*   **Location:** In the \"Piazza della Rotonda,\" the square in front of the Pantheon in Rome.\n*   **Status:** It no longer exists.\n*   **Timeline:** It existed *until* 1950.\n*   **Reason for Disappearance:** It was \"removed by the city administration.\"\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Potential Misconceptions\n1.  **The Pantheon:** The Pantheon itself is the main feature, but it was obviously not removed.\n2.  **The Fountain (Fontana del Pantheon):** The beautiful fountain in the center of the square is a major architectural feature. However, it was *not* removed and is still there today.\n3.  **The Obelisk:** The Egyptian obelisk on top of the fountain is also a key feature. It was added in 1711 and remains in place.\n4.  **The \"Architectural Feature\" concept:** This term doesn't necessarily mean a building. It can refer to any significant man-made element that defines the structure and appearance of the space. This could include paving, lighting, or transportation infrastructure.\n5.  **The Date \"1950\":** This date is crucial. It points to the post-WWII period in Rome, a time of modernization, traffic reorganization, and preparations for the 1950 Holy Year (Giubileo), which often involved \"cleaning up\" historical areas.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n1.  Since the main, permanent monuments (Pantheon, fountain, obelisk) are still present, we must look for a more transient or functional feature that has been removed.\n2.  Researching the history of the Piazza della Rotonda's urban development in the 20th century reveals that, like many parts of central Rome, it was served by the city's tram network.\n3.  Historical photographs from the first half of the 20th century clearly show tram tracks running through the square.\n4.  What made this feature \"unique\" was its layout. The tracks formed a complete circle, an \"anello di binari\" (ring of tracks), around the central fountain. This allowed trams to loop around the monument. The sight of a noisy, modern tram circling a 2,000-year-old temple and a Renaissance fountain was certainly a unique, and to many, a jarring, feature.\n5.  The removal of tram lines from Rome's historic center was a major project undertaken by the city administration in the post-war years to alleviate traffic congestion and improve the decorum of historical sites. The removal of the Pantheon tram ring fits this exact pattern and timeline, with many central lines being decommissioned in the run-up to the 1950 Holy Year.\n6.  Therefore, the feature that fits all the criteria—a unique architectural feature in the square, removed by the city administration around 1950—is the ring of tram tracks.\n\n<<<The ring of tram tracks that circled the central fountain.>>>"
