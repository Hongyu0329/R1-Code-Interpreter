    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the sum of squares of coefficients to the polynomial**\n\nLet the polynomial be $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$. We are asked to find $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\nConsider the product of $P(x)$ and $P(x^{-1})$:\n$P(x) P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\sum_j a_j x^j\\right) \\left(\\sum_l a_l x^{-l}\\right) = \\sum_{j,l} a_j a_l x^{j-l}$.\nThe constant term of this product is the term where the exponent is zero, which happens when $j=l$. The constant term is therefore $\\sum_k a_k a_k = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\nSo, our goal is to find the constant term of the polynomial $Q(x) = P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\n**Step 2: Express P(x)P(x⁻¹) in a manageable form**\n\nThe polynomial $P(x)$ is given by:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\nLet $f_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$. Then $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} f_i(x)$.\nThe polynomial $Q(x)$ can be written as:\n$Q(x) = P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} f_i(x)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} f_i(x^{-1})\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left(f_i(x)f_i(x^{-1})\\right)$.\nLet's analyze the term $g_i(x) = f_i(x)f_i(x^{-1})$. Let $y = x^{3^i}$.\n$f_i(x) = 1+y+y^2+y^3$.\n$f_i(x^{-1}) = 1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3}$.\n$g_i(x) = (1+y+y^2+y^3)(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3})$.\nExpanding this product gives:\n$g_i(x) = (1+y+y^2+y^3) \\cdot 1 + (1+y+y^2+y^3) \\cdot y^{-1} + (1+y+y^2+y^3) \\cdot y^{-2} + (1+y+y^2+y^3) \\cdot y^{-3}$\n$= (1+y+y^2+y^3) + (y^{-1}+1+y+y^2) + (y^{-2}+y^{-1}+1+y) + (y^{-3}+y^{-2}+y^{-1}+1)$.\nCollecting terms with the same power of $y$:\nThe constant term is $1+1+1+1=4$.\nThe coefficient of $y$ is $1+1+1=3$. By symmetry, the coefficient of $y^{-1}$ is also 3.\nThe coefficient of $y^2$ is $1+1=2$. By symmetry, the coefficient of $y^{-2}$ is also 2.\nThe coefficient of $y^3$ is $1$. By symmetry, the coefficient of $y^{-3}$ is also 1.\nSo, substituting $y=x^{3^i}$, we have:\n$g_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + 1(x^{3\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i})$.\nNote that $3 \\cdot 3^i = 3^{i+1}$. So,\n$g_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + (x^{3^{i+1}}+x^{-3^{i+1}})$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the constant term of the product Q(x)**\n\nWe need to find the constant term of $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} g_i(x)$.\nThe constant term of a product of polynomials is the sum of products of coefficients, where the exponents of the chosen terms sum to zero.\nLet $[H(x)]_0$ denote the constant term of a polynomial $H(x)$.\n$[Q(x)]_0 = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} g_i(x) \\right]_0$.\nA term in the expansion of this product is formed by choosing one term from each $g_i(x)$ and multiplying them together. For the result to be a constant term, the sum of the exponents of the chosen terms must be zero.\nLet $c_i(k)$ be the coefficient of $x^k$ in $g_i(x)$. We are looking for\n$[Q(x)]_0 = \\sum_{e_0, e_1, \\dots, e_{19}} c_0(e_0) c_1(e_1) \\cdots c_{19}(e_{19})$, where the sum is over all tuples of exponents $(e_0, \\dots, e_{19})$ such that $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} e_i = 0$.\n\nThe set of non-zero exponents in $g_i(x)$ is $E_i = \\{\\pm 3^i, \\pm 2\\cdot 3^i, \\pm 3^{i+1}\\}$. Let's find the combinations of exponents that sum to zero. We use a base-3 representation argument.\nAn exponent sum $E = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} e_i = 0$. The powers of 3 involved are $3^0, 3^1, \\dots, 3^{20}$.\nAn argument based on the uniqueness of the balanced base-3 representation shows that the sum of exponents $\\sum e_i$ can be zero in the following cases only:\n1.  **The trivial case:** $e_i=0$ for all $i=0, \\dots, 19$.\n2.  **Adjacent swaps:** For some $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, 18\\}$, we have $e_k = \\pm 3^{k+1}$ and $e_{k+1} = \\mp 3^{k+1}$, and all other exponents $e_j$ (for $j \\neq k, k+1$) are zero.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the contributions from each case**\n\n1.  **Contribution from the trivial case ($e_i=0$ for all i):**\n    The contribution is the product of the constant terms of each $g_i(x)$.\n    The constant term of each $g_i(x)$ is 4.\n    Contribution$_0 = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} [g_i(x)]_0 = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20}$.\n\n2.  **Contribution from adjacent swaps:**\n    Consider a fixed $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, 18\\}$.\n    -   Case A: $e_k=3^{k+1}$, $e_{k+1}=-3^{k+1}$, and $e_j=0$ for $j \\neq k, k+1$.\n        The contribution is the product of the corresponding coefficients:\n        $c_k(3^{k+1}) \\cdot c_{k+1}(-3^{k+1}) \\cdot \\prod_{j \\neq k,k+1} c_j(0)$.\n        From the expression for $g_i(x)$:\n        -   The coefficient of $x^{3^{i+1}}$ in $g_i(x)$ is 1. So, $c_k(3^{k+1}) = 1$.\n        -   The coefficient of $x^{-3^{(i)}} = x^{-3 \\cdot 3^{i-1}}$ in $g_i(x)$ is 3. So, the coefficient of $x^{-3^{k+1}}$ in $g_{k+1}(x)$ is $c_{k+1}(-3^{k+1}) = 3$.\n        -   The constant term for the other 18 factors is 4.\n        Contribution$_A(k) = 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4^{18} = 3 \\cdot 4^{18}$.\n    -   Case B: $e_k=-3^{k+1}$, $e_{k+1}=3^{k+1}$, and $e_j=0$ for $j \\neq k, k+1$.\n        The contribution is $c_k(-3^{k+1}) \\cdot c_{k+1}(3^{k+1}) \\cdot \\prod_{j \\neq k,k+1} c_j(0)$.\n        -   The coefficient of $x^{-3^{i+1}}$ in $g_i(x)$ is 1. So, $c_k(-3^{k+1}) = 1$.\n        -   The coefficient of $x^{3^{k+1}}$ in $g_{k+1}(x)$ is 3. So, $c_{k+1}(3^{k+1}) = 3$.\n        Contribution$_B(k) = 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4^{18} = 3 \\cdot 4^{18}$.\n\n    The total contribution for a fixed $k$ is $3 \\cdot 4^{18} + 3 \\cdot 4^{18} = 6 \\cdot 4^{18}$.\n    Since $k$ can range from 0 to 18 (a total of 19 values), the total contribution from all such swaps is $19 \\times (6 \\cdot 4^{18})$.\n\n**Step 5: Sum all contributions**\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the contributions from all cases.\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = [\\text{Trivial Case}] + \\sum_{k=0}^{18} [\\text{Swap Cases for } k]$\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = 4^{20} + 19 \\cdot (6 \\cdot 4^{18})$\nTo simplify, let's write $4^{20}$ in terms of $4^{18}$:\n$4^{20} = 4^2 \\cdot 4^{18} = 16 \\cdot 4^{18}$.\nSo, the sum is:\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = 16 \\cdot 4^{18} + 19 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4^{18}$\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = 16 \\cdot 4^{18} + 114 \\cdot 4^{18}$\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = (16 + 114) \\cdot 4^{18}$\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = 130 \\cdot 4^{18}$\nWe can write this in terms of powers of 2: $4^{18} = (2^2)^{18} = 2^{36}$.\nSo, the final answer is $130 \\cdot 2^{36}$. This can also be written as $65 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2^{36} = 65 \\cdot 2^{37}$."
