    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer gain matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to design an observer for the given discrete-time system such that the observation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a \"deadbeat observer\".\n\nThe observer dynamics are given by:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))\nwhere x̂ is the estimated state, ŷ = Cx̂ is the estimated output, and L is the observer gain matrix to be designed.\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error, e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k), are:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor the error to become identically zero after a finite number of steps, the matrix (A - LC) must be nilpotent, meaning (A - LC)^N = 0 for some integer N. This implies that all eigenvalues of the matrix (A - LC) must be located at the origin (λ = 0) in the complex plane. The problem is thus a pole placement problem for the observer. The shortest number of steps corresponds to the nilpotency index of (A-LC), which is at least the observability index of the system.\n\n**2. Check System Observability**\n\nThe ability to place the eigenvalues of (A - LC) arbitrarily depends on the observability of the pair (A, C). The system is observable if the observability matrix, O, has full rank (which is n=4, the dimension of the state space).\n\nThe observability matrix is O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3].\nThe given matrices are:\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\nC = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\nLet's compute the necessary products:\n*   C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]\n*   CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]\n*   A^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [-3, 0, 2, -1], [2, 0, -1, 3], [0, 1, 0, -4]]\n*   CA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [0, 1, 1, -6]]\n\nLet's construct the observability matrix up to index 3, O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]:\nO_3 = [\n    [1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [-2, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, -2],\n    [0, 1, 1, -6]\n]\nTo check if the rank of this 6x4 matrix is 4, we can select 4 rows and check for linear independence. Let's select row 1, row 2, row 4, and row 6.\nM = [\n    [1, 0, 0, 0],  (from C)\n    [1, 0, 0, 1],  (from C)\n    [-2, 0, 1, 0],  (from CA)\n    [0, 1, 1, -6]   (from CA^2)\n]\nThe determinant of M is det(M) = -1. Since the determinant is non-zero, these four rows are linearly independent, and the rank of O_3 is 4. Therefore, the system is observable. The observability index ν is 3, which is the shortest time in which the error can be guaranteed to be zero.\n\n**3. Formulate the Pole Placement Problem using Duality**\n\nDesigning the observer gain L for the system (A, C) is dual to designing a state-feedback controller gain K_c for the system (A^T, C^T). The eigenvalues of (A - LC) are the same as the eigenvalues of (A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T.\nWe want to design a gain K_c such that the closed-loop matrix A_c_cl = A^T + C^T K_c has all its eigenvalues at 0. The relationship between the gains is K_c = -L^T, or L = -K_c^T.\n\nThe dual system matrices are:\nA_c = A^T = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]]\nB_c = C^T = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nThis is a multi-input control problem. However, we can check if the system is controllable from a single input channel. Let's use the first column of B_c, denoted by b1:\nb1 = [1, 0, 0, 0]^T\nThe controllability of the pair (A_c, b1) is determined by the rank of the controllability matrix Q1 = [b1, A_c*b1, A_c^2*b1, A_c^3*b1]. It can be shown that this matrix has rank 4, so the dual system is controllable using only the first input.\n\nThis simplifies the problem greatly. We can design a controller using only the first input, which means the gain matrix K_c will have a non-zero first row and a zero second row. Let K_c = [K1; [0 0 0 0]], where K1 = [k1, k2, k3, k4] is the feedback gain for the SISO system (A_c, b1).\n\n**4. Solve the SISO Pole Placement Problem**\n\nWe want to find K1 = [k1, k2, k3, k4] such that the matrix A_c + b1*K1 has all eigenvalues at 0.\nA_c + b1*K1 = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]] + [[1],[0],[0],[0]] * [k1, k2, k3, k4]\n= [[-1+k1, 1+k2, k3, -1+k4], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of this matrix is det(λI - (A_c + b1*K1)).\ndet([[λ+1-k1, -1-k2, -k3, 1-k4], [0, λ, -1, 0], [0, 0, λ, -1], [-1, -2, 1, λ+1]])\nExpanding the determinant gives:\nP(λ) = λ^4 + (2 - k1)λ^3 + (3 - k1 - k4)λ^2 + (-1 - k1 - k3)λ + (-3 + 2k1 - k2)\n\nFor a deadbeat response, we want the characteristic polynomial to be P(λ) = λ^4. We achieve this by setting the coefficients of λ^3, λ^2, λ^1, and λ^0 to zero:\n1.  Coeff λ^3: 2 - k1 = 0  =>  k1 = 2\n2.  Coeff λ^2: 3 - k1 - k4 = 0  =>  3 - 2 - k4 = 0  =>  k4 = 1\n3.  Coeff λ^1: -1 - k1 - k3 = 0  =>  -1 - 2 - k3 = 0  =>  k3 = -3\n4.  Coeff λ^0: -3 + 2k1 - k2 = 0  =>  -3 + 2(2) - k2 = 0  =>  1 - k2 = 0  => k2 = 1\n\nSo, the controller gain for the SISO dual system is K1 = [2, 1, -3, 1].\n\n**5. Determine the Observer Gain Matrix L**\n\nThe full controller gain for the dual MIMO system is:\nK_c = [[2, 1, -3, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nThe observer gain L is obtained from the relationship L = -K_c^T.\nL = - [[2, 1, -3, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]^T\nL = - [[2, 0], [1, 0], [-3, 0], [1, 0]]\nL = [[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe gain matrix of the observer is:\n<<<[[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]>>>"
