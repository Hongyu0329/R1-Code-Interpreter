    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Language and the Concept Class\n\nFirst, we need to understand what kind of concepts are definable by the given logical fragment.\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A model (or a database instance) for this schema over a universe $U$ is a set of interpretations for these predicates, i.e., four subsets $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ of $U$, where $C_i = \\{u \\in U \\mid P_i(u) \\text{ is true}\\}$.\n\n2.  **Logical Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of first-order logic that allows only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). We are interested in formulas with one free variable, say $x$, as these formulas define concepts (subsets of the universe).\n\n3.  **Formulas defining concepts**: Let's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in this fragment.\n    *   **Atomic formulas**: The atomic formulas involve the predicates from $S$. With a free variable $x$, they are $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n    *   **Conjunction**: We can form conjunctions of atomic formulas, e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n    *   **Existential Quantification**: We can quantify over variables *other than* $x$. For example, a formula could be $\\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y))$.\n    *   **General Form**: A general formula $\\phi(x)$ will look like $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k (\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k))$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since all predicates are unary, the atoms in $\\psi$ can only have one variable each. So, $\\psi$ can be written as a conjunction of atoms involving $x$, atoms involving $y_1$, atoms involving $y_2$, and so on.\n    *   Let's rewrite $\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$ as $\\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{y_1}(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_{y_k}(y_k)$, where each $\\psi_z(z)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving only the variable $z$.\n    *   The formula $\\phi(x)$ is then equivalent to:\n        $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 \\psi_{y_1}(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists y_k \\psi_{y_k}(y_k))$.\n    *   Each subformula of the form $\\exists y_j \\psi_{y_j}(y_j)$ is a *sentence* (it has no free variables). Its truth value depends only on the overall model, not on the specific value assigned to $x$. For any given model, $\\exists y_j \\psi_{y_j}(y_j)$ is either true (equivalent to $\\top$) or false (equivalent to $\\bot$).\n    *   Therefore, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to either $\\psi_x(x)$ (if all the quantified parts are true) or $\\bot$ (if at least one quantified part is false).\n    *   The formula $\\psi_x(x)$ is a conjunction of some subset of the atomic formulas $\\{P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)\\}$. Let this subset of predicates be indexed by $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The formula is $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$.\n    *   The constants $\\top$ and $\\bot$ are also in the language. $\\top$ is equivalent to an empty conjunction ($I = \\emptyset$). $\\bot$ defines the empty set.\n\n4.  **The Concept Class**: The set of all concepts definable by this logic (the concept class $\\mathcal{C}$) consists of sets of elements satisfying formulas of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for all possible $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   In terms of the sets $C_i = \\{u \\in U \\mid P_i(u)\\}$, these concepts are precisely the sets formed by intersections: $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} C_i$.\n    *   This is the class of concepts known as **monomials** over 4 boolean features (where the features are the predicates).\n\n### Step 2: Define and Calculate the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class is the size $d$ of the largest set of points that can be *shattered* by the class. A set $X$ is shattered if for every subset $X' \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $C$ in the class such that $C \\cap X = X'$.\n\nWe need to find the VC dimension of the class of concepts formed by intersecting 4 base sets. This is a classic result: the VC dimension is 4. Let's prove it.\n\n#### Part A: Proving VC dimension $\\ge 4$ (Lower Bound)\n\nWe need to show that there exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered. This requires us to construct a specific model (i.e., define the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$) over a set of 4 points.\n\n*   Let the set of points be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\n*   Let's define the interpretation of the predicates on this set. For each predicate $P_i$, we define its extension $C_i = \\{x \\in X \\mid P_i(x)\\}$. Let's choose the following:\n    *   $C_1 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_1\\}$\n    *   $C_2 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_2\\}$\n    *   $C_3 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_3\\}$\n    *   $C_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_4\\}$\n*   Now, we must show that for any subset $X' \\subseteq X$, we can find a concept $C = \\bigcap_{j \\in J} C_j$ (for some $J \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$) such that $C \\cap X = X'$.\n*   Let $X'$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. Let $J = \\{j \\mid x_j \\notin X'\\}$. We claim the concept $C = \\bigcap_{j \\in J} C_j$ realizes the subset $X'$.\n*   Let's verify this claim.\n    *   Take an element $x_k \\in X'$. We need to show $x_k \\in C$. By our choice of $J$, for any $j \\in J$, we have $x_j \\notin X'$. Since $x_k \\in X'$, we know $k \\ne j$. By definition of $C_j = X \\setminus \\{x_j\\}$, this means $x_k \\in C_j$. Since this holds for all $j \\in J$, we have $x_k \\in \\bigcap_{j \\in J} C_j = C$.\n    *   Take an element $x_k \\notin X'$. We need to show $x_k \\notin C$. By our choice of $J$, the index $k$ is in $J$. So the intersection that defines $C$ includes the set $C_k$. By definition, $C_k = X \\setminus \\{x_k\\}$, so $x_k \\notin C_k$. Therefore, $x_k$ cannot be in the intersection, so $x_k \\notin C$.\n\nSince we can generate every subset of $X$, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n#### Part B: Proving VC dimension $\\le 4$ (Upper Bound)\n\nWe need to show that no set of 5 points can be shattered. This must hold for *any* model.\n\n*   Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points.\n*   For any given model, we can associate each point $x_j \\in X$ with a binary vector $v_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$, where the $i$-th component is 1 if $P_i(x_j)$ is true, and 0 otherwise.\n*   We now have 5 vectors $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ in the 4-dimensional vector space over the field of two elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2^4$.\n*   Any set of $d+1$ vectors in a $d$-dimensional vector space is linearly dependent. Here, we have 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional space, so they must be linearly dependent over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n*   This means there exists a non-empty subset of these vectors that sums to the zero vector (modulo 2). Let the corresponding subset of points be $T \\subseteq X$, where $T \\neq \\emptyset$. So, $\\sum_{x_j \\in T} v_j = \\vec{0} \\pmod 2$.\n*   This has a crucial combinatorial consequence: for any concept $C_J = \\bigcap_{j \\in J} C_j$ in our class, the size of the intersection $|C_J \\cap T|$ must be an even number.\n*   To shatter $X$, we must be able to generate *every* subset of $X$.\n*   Let's pick a single point $x_k$ from the non-empty set $T$. Consider the subset $X' = \\{x_k\\}$. This is a subset of $X$ of size 1.\n*   If $X$ were shattered, there must be a concept $C_J$ from our class such that $C_J \\cap X = X' = \\{x_k\\}$.\n*   Now consider the intersection of this concept's realization with the set $T$:\n    $C_J \\cap T = (C_J \\cap X) \\cap T = \\{x_k\\} \\cap T$.\n*   Since $x_k \\in T$, this intersection is $\\{x_k\\}$.\n*   The size of this intersection is $|C_J \\cap T| = |\\{x_k\\}| = 1$.\n*   But 1 is an odd number. This contradicts the property derived from linear dependence that $|C_J \\cap T|$ must be even for any concept $C_J$.\n*   Therefore, the subset $\\{x_k\\}$ cannot be generated. Since not all subsets of $X$ can be generated, $X$ is not shattered.\n*   This argument holds for any set of 5 points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that a set of 4 points can be shattered (VCdim $\\ge 4$) and that no set of 5 points can be shattered (VCdim $\\le 4$). Therefore, the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
