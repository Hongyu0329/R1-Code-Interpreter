    "This problem requires finding the conditions for the existence of a special type of fixed point for a system of three functions. This falls into the domain of fixed point theory, and the most common set of conditions comes from generalizing the Banach Contraction Principle to a system of equations on a product space.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Defining the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nFirst, we must formally define the object we are looking for.\n\n*   **Functions and Spaces**: We are given three non-empty sets `X`, `Y`, `Z` and three functions:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    *(Note: The question listed the third function as `G: Z*Y*X→Z`, which is assumed to be a typo for `H` given the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\".)*\n\n*   **Definition**: An **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z`, that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Reformulating as a Single Fixed Point Problem**\n\nThe core idea is to treat this system of three equations as a single fixed point equation for a larger, combined operator `T` acting on the Cartesian product space `M = X × Y × Z`.\n\n*   **Product Space**: Define the space `M = X × Y × Z`. An element `p` in `M` is a triplet `p = (x, y, z)`.\n*   **Combined Operator**: Define an operator `T: M → M` as follows:\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n*   **Equivalence**: A point `p = (x, y, z)` is a fixed point of `T` if and only if `T(p) = p`. Writing this out, we get:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`\n    `(F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x)) = (x, y, z)`\n    This is precisely the system of equations defining an FGH-tripled fixed point. Therefore, finding conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point is equivalent to finding conditions for the operator `T` to have a fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Banach Contraction Principle**\n\nThe Banach Contraction Principle provides a powerful set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. To apply it to our operator `T`, we need two main things: a complete metric space and a contraction mapping.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Complete Metric Spaces**\n    The spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: If the individual spaces are complete, the product space `M = X × Y × Z` can be equipped with a metric `d_M` that also makes `(M, d_M)` a complete metric space. A common choice is the sum metric (or `L₁` metric):\n        `d_M((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n*   **Condition 2: Contraction Mapping**\n    The combined operator `T` must be a **contraction mapping** on `(M, d_M)`. This means there must exist a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `p₁, p₂ ∈ M`:\n    `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d_M(p₁, p₂)`\n\n**Step 4: Deriving Conditions on F, G, and H**\n\nThe general condition that `T` is a contraction is not very practical. We can derive a more useful set of conditions on the individual functions `F`, `G`, and `H` that together imply `T` is a contraction. These take the form of generalized Lipschitz conditions.\n\n*   **Lipschitz-like Conditions**: Assume there exist non-negative constants `αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n    a) `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    b) `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    c) `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   **Careful Point**: Note the coefficients match the dependencies. `G(y,x,y)` depends on `X` and `Y`, so its inequality has terms for `d_X` and `d_Y`. `H(z,y,x)` depends on `X, Y, Z`, so it has terms for all three.\n\n*   **Combining the Inequalities**: Now we check the contraction condition for `T` using the sum metric `d_M`.\n    `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) = d_X(F(…), F(…)) + d_Y(G(…), G(…)) + d_Z(H(…), H(…))`\n    Substituting the inequalities from above:\n    `≤ [α₁d_X + α₂d_Y + α₃d_Z] + [β₁d_X + β₂d_Y] + [γ₁d_X + γ₂d_Y + γ₃d_Z]`\n    Grouping terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n    `= (α₁+β₁+γ₁)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (α₂+β₂+γ₂)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (α₃+γ₃)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    Let `k_x = α₁+β₁+γ₁`, `k_y = α₂+β₂+γ₂`, and `k_z = α₃+γ₃`.\n    `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k_x d_X + k_y d_Y + k_z d_Z`\n    Let `k = max{k_x, k_y, k_z}`. Then:\n    `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k*d_X + k*d_Y + k*d_Z = k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z) = k * d_M(p₁, p₂)`\n    For `T` to be a contraction, we need `k < 1`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe conditions for the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are given by an application of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem on the product space `X × Y × Z`. The conditions are as follows:\n\n1.  **Space Conditions**: The sets `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty **complete metric spaces**.\n\n2.  **Function Conditions**: The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy a set of contraction-type inequalities. Specifically, there must exist nine non-negative constants (`α₁`, `α₂`, `α₃`, `β₁`, `β₂`, `γ₁`, `γ₂`, `γ₃`) such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n3.  **Overall Contraction Condition**: The constants from the inequalities above must satisfy the following condition:\n    `max { (α₁ + β₁ + γ₁), (α₂ + β₂ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₃) } < 1`\n\nIf all these conditions are met, there exists a unique triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`.\n\n<<<The conditions are:\n1.  The spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are non-empty complete metric spaces with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z` respectively.\n2.  There exist non-negative constants `α₁`, `α₂`, `α₃`, `β₁`, `β₂`, `γ₁`, `γ₂`, `γ₃` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n    a) `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    b) `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    c) `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n3.  The sum of the constants related to each space is less than 1:\n    `max { (α₁ + β₁ + γ₁), (α₂ + β₂ + γ₂), (α₃ + γ₃) } < 1`\nUnder these conditions, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.>>>"
