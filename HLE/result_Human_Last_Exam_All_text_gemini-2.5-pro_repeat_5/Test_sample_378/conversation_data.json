    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to find a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan made a public act of identifying himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". This implies that he either added the name, started using it for the first time publicly, or made a significant declaration about it at a specific point in time.\n\n2.  **Verify the Name:** The first step is to confirm the full and official name of the former Nigerian President. His full birth name is **Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan**. \"Azikiwe\" is not a name he adopted later in life; it is one of his given names.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Premise:** The question is based on the premise that there was a specific event or year where he \"started\" to identify as Azikiwe. We need to investigate if such an event ever took place.\n\n4.  **Review Public Records:** A review of his public life and political career shows that his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" has been used in official documents and public records throughout his career. This includes his time as:\n    *   Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State (1999–2005)\n    *   Governor of Bayelsa State (2005–2007)\n    *   Vice President of Nigeria (2007–2010)\n    *   President of Nigeria (2010–2015)\n\n5.  **Search for a Specific \"Identification\" Event:** A thorough search of news archives, official statements, and biographies does not reveal any specific year, speech, or public declaration where Goodluck Jonathan made a point of \"identifying himself as Azikiwe\" as if it were a new or previously hidden part of his identity.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Given Name vs. Adopted Name:** It is crucial to distinguish between a given name and a name adopted later. \"Azikiwe\" is part of his birth name.\n*   **Public Awareness vs. Personal Identification:** Public awareness of his full name certainly grew as he rose to national prominence (especially from 2007 onwards). However, this is different from him taking a new action to \"identify\" himself. The public becoming aware of a fact is not the same as the subject of that fact making a new declaration.\n*   **False Premise:** The question operates on a false premise. It assumes an event (a public declaration or a first-time use of the name) that never actually happened. He has always been Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThere is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan \"publicly identified himself as Azikiwe\" because it has always been part of his official name since birth. The premise of the question is incorrect, as no such singular event occurred. He did not need to publicly identify with a name that was already his.\n\n<<<This event never occurred."
