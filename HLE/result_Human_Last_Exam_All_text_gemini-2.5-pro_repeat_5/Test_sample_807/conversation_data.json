    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe chemical name provided is 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride. This is the formal IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name for a specific molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Common Name of the Chemical**\nSearching for this long chemical name reveals that its common name is **Rhodamine B**.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Properties of Rhodamine B**\nRhodamine B is a well-known synthetic chemical dye. Its primary characteristics are:\n*   **Color:** It is a reddish-violet to magenta powder. When dissolved, it produces a brilliant pink to red solution.\n*   **Fluorescence:** Its most notable property is its intense fluorescence. It absorbs light (particularly in the green part of the spectrum) and re-emits it as orange-red light. This property makes it useful as a fluorescent tracer dye and as a pigment for creating exceptionally bright, neon-like colors.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Chemical to Crayola Crayon Pigments**\nGiven its properties, Rhodamine B would be used to create very bright, fluorescent colors. The most logical place to find it would be in Crayola's line of fluorescent or \"Neon\" crayons.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Specific Crayon Color**\nWhile one might intuitively assume Rhodamine B would be in a pink or magenta crayon, its use in color chemistry is more complex. To create intensely vibrant colors, manufacturers sometimes mix fluorescent dyes with standard pigments.\n*   Analysis by chemists has shown that Rhodamine B is used as an ingredient in the Crayola crayon color **Screamin' Green**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This seems counter-intuitive. Why would a pink dye be in a green crayon? The base color of the crayon is created by mixing traditional yellow and blue pigments to make green. The pink fluorescent dye, Rhodamine B, is then added. It absorbs some of the yellow-green light that the crayon would normally reflect and re-emits it as reddish light. This addition of emitted light makes the overall color appear significantly brighter and more vivid to the human eye, giving it the \"screaming\" or neon effect. The crayon still looks green, but it's an unusually vibrant, fluorescent green because of this trick of color chemistry.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride, commonly known as Rhodamine B, is used as a fluorescent brightener in the formulation for the Crayola crayon color Screamin' Green.\n\n<<<Screamin' Green>>>"
