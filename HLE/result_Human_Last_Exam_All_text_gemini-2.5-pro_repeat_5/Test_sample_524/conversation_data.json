    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms\n\nThe question asks for the number of **homeomorphism classes** of **homogeneous planar continua**. To understand this, we must define each term.\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval, a disk, a sphere, and a circle.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of the plane. For example, the circle is planar, but the sphere ($S^2$) and the torus ($T^2$) are not.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \\to X$ (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) such that $h(x) = y$. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point. The circle is homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point), but a closed interval is not (an endpoint cannot be mapped to an interior point by a homeomorphism of the interval onto itself).\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** Two spaces are in the same homeomorphism class if they are homeomorphic to each other. The question asks for the number of topologically distinct types of spaces that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nSo, the question is: How many topologically distinct, compact, connected spaces are there that can be drawn in the plane and look the same from every point?\n\n### Step 2: The Classification Strategy\n\nThis is a classic and deep question in the field of continuum theory. The solution is not based on a simple calculation but on a set of profound classification theorems developed over several decades. The standard approach to classifying these objects is to divide them into two mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories:\n\n1.  **Tree-like continua:** These are continua that do not contain any simple closed curve (a subspace homeomorphic to a circle).\n2.  **Non-tree-like continua:** These are continua that contain at least one simple closed curve.\n\nEvery continuum falls into exactly one of these two categories. We will analyze each case separately.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Case 1 - Tree-like Homogeneous Planar Continua\n\nA theorem by J. B. Fugate and T. B. McLean provides the complete classification for this case.\n\n*   **Theorem (Fugate-McLean, 1980):** Any non-degenerate, tree-like, homogeneous, planar continuum is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.\n\nThis theorem identifies one specific object, the **pseudo-arc**. What about the degenerate case?\n\n*   **The Degenerate Case:** A \"degenerate\" continuum is a single point.\n    *   Is a point a continuum? Yes, it is compact and connected.\n    *   Is it planar? Yes.\n    *   Is it homogeneous? Yes, trivially.\n    *   Is it tree-like? Yes, as it contains no simple closed curves.\n    Therefore, the **point** is the first homeomorphism class.\n\n*   **The Non-Degenerate Case:** The theorem identifies the **pseudo-arc**.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is a fascinating object. It is a one-dimensional, snake-like continuum that is indecomposable (cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua) and hereditarily indecomposable. A key result by R. H. Bing (1951) showed it is homogeneous. It is also tree-like and planar.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is topologically distinct from a point.\n    Therefore, the **pseudo-arc** is the second homeomorphism class.\n\nThis covers all tree-like possibilities. There are two such homeomorphism classes.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Case 2 - Non-tree-like Homogeneous Planar Continua\n\nA theorem by James T. Rogers, Jr. provides the complete classification for this case.\n\n*   **Theorem (Rogers, 1985):** Any non-tree-like, homogeneous, planar continuum is homeomorphic to either the circle or the circle of pseudo-arcs.\n\nThis theorem gives us two more candidates.\n\n*   **The Circle ($S^1$):**\n    *   Is it a continuum? Yes. Is it planar? Yes. Is it non-tree-like? Yes, it *is* a simple closed curve. Is it homogeneous? Yes.\n    *   The circle is locally connected, a property not shared by the pseudo-arc or the circle of pseudo-arcs. It is distinct from the point and the pseudo-arc.\n    Therefore, the **circle** is the third homeomorphism class.\n\n*   **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   This continuum is constructed by taking a circle and replacing each point with a pseudo-arc in a continuous fashion. It is a non-locally connected, indecomposable continuum. It is homogeneous, planar, and non-tree-like (since it contains a \"core\" simple closed curve).\n    *   It is topologically distinct from the point, the pseudo-arc (as it is not tree-like), and the circle (as it is not locally connected).\n    Therefore, the **circle of pseudo-arcs** is the fourth homeomorphism class.\n\nThis covers all non-tree-like possibilities. There are two such homeomorphism classes.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the results from the two exhaustive cases, we have found a total of four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nThe four classes are:\n1.  **The Point** (degenerate, tree-like, locally connected)\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc** (non-degenerate, tree-like, not locally connected)\n3.  **The Circle** (non-degenerate, not tree-like, locally connected)\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs** (non-degenerate, not tree-like, not locally connected)\n\nThese four objects are all topologically distinct from one another, and the classification theorems of Fugate-McLean and Rogers show that this list is complete.\n\nThus, there are exactly 4 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
