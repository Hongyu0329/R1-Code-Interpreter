    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific mushroom *genus*. The defining and most crucial characteristic given is that it produces a \"distinctly blue spore print\". The question also states there is a \"single genus\" known for this, implying this trait is exceptionally rare.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Careful Points\" and Potential Pitfalls**\n\n*   **Spore Print vs. Mushroom Color:** A common mistake is to confuse the color of the mushroom's body (the cap or stem) with the color of its spores. Many mushrooms are blue, but their spore prints are not. For example, the Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*) is a vibrant blue mushroom, but its spore print is cream to yellowish.\n*   **Spore Print vs. Bruising Reaction:** Another point of confusion is the blue staining or bruising reaction seen in many mushrooms, particularly those containing psilocybin (e.g., in the genus *Psilocybe*). This blueing is a chemical reaction in the mushroom's flesh when it's damaged. The spore print of these mushrooms is typically purple-brown to black, not blue.\n*   **Rarity of the Trait:** A true blue spore print is extremely rare in the fungal kingdom. Standard spore print colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, olive, brown, and black. Blue is a significant outlier.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Potential Candidates**\n\n1.  ***Lactarius***: As mentioned, *Lactarius indigo* is a blue mushroom, but its spore print is yellowish. This genus is not the answer.\n2.  ***Psilocybe***: This genus is known for blue bruising, but its spore print is purple-brown to black. This genus is not the answer.\n3.  ***Entoloma***: This is a very large genus, often called \"pinkgills\" because the vast majority of its species produce a pinkish spore print. However, the genus is also famous for containing species with strikingly blue mushroom bodies, such as *Entoloma hochstetteri* (the New Zealand blue mushroom). While *E. hochstetteri* itself has a pink spore print, the association with the color blue makes the genus a strong candidate.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Correct Genus with Evidence**\nWhile most *Entoloma* species have pink spores, mycological literature reports that at least one species within this group produces a genuinely blue spore print. This species is *Entoloma virescens* (sometimes placed in the recently separated genus *Entocybe*). Found in Japan, it is described as having a pale blue or sky-blue spore deposit. Since this species belongs to the genus *Entoloma* (or its direct offshoot *Entocybe*), *Entoloma* is recognized as the one genus that contains this unique trait. Even though it is just one or a few species and not the entire genus, it is the genus *known* for this rare feature.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the existence of species like *Entoloma virescens*, which are documented to produce a blue spore print, the single genus known for this characteristic is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
