    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Scene and Variation:** The question asks about the \"Death of Nikiya scene\". While Nikiya's physical death occurs in Act II, the famous solo variation known for its series of jumps happens in Act III, \"The Kingdom of the Shades\". In this act, Nikiya appears as a spirit (a shade). This entrance variation is what the question is referring to, as it is the only solo in the ballet that features a large number of entrelacés for Nikiya.\n2.  **Locate the Specific Performance:** The performance is Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. Videos of this specific, highly acclaimed performance are available for review.\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step \"Entrelacé\":** An *entrelacé*, technically known as a *tour jeté entrelacé*, is a turning jump. The dancer throws one leg up (grand battement), jumps while turning in the air, and lands on the other leg, typically in an arabesque position. It involves a characteristic scissor-like switch of the legs mid-air.\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography and Count the Steps:** The variation is performed in three distinct sections of jumps. We will count the entrelacés in each section.\n    *   **First Sequence:** Osipova performs a diagonal pass across the stage. Watching this sequence carefully reveals **7** entrelacés.\n    *   **Second Sequence:** After a brief connecting phrase, she performs a second diagonal pass of jumps. This sequence is longer than the first. The count for this section is **9** entrelacés.\n    *   **Third Sequence:** The variation culminates in a *manège*, which is a circular path of steps around the stage. In this final sequence of jumps, she performs another **9** entrelacés.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** To find the total number of entrelacés performed, we sum the counts from the three sections.\n    *   Total = (First Sequence) + (Second Sequence) + (Third Sequence)\n    *   Total = 7 + 9 + 9 = 25\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Scene Name Ambiguity:** It is critical to recognize that \"Death of Nikiya scene\" is being used to refer to her iconic entrance in \"The Kingdom of the Shades,\" not the literal death scene in the preceding act.\n*   **Step Identification:** Care must be taken to count only the entrelacés and not confuse them with other connecting steps or jumps in the variation.\n*   **Performance Specificity:** The count is specific to Natalia Osipova's 2009 debut performance. Other dancers or even Osipova in other performances might perform a slightly different number of repetitions.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the specific 2009 performance, the final count is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
