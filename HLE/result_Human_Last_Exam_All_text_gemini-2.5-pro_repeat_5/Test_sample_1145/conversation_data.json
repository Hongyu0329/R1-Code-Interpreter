    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the probability of locating a particle in a specific interval within a 1D box.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Wavefunction**\n*   The system is a particle confined to a one-dimensional box of length `a`. The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in the n-th energy state is given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n*   The problem specifies that the particle is in the `n = 2` state. So, the wavefunction is:\n    `ψ_2(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n\n**2. Formulate the Probability Calculation**\n*   The probability of finding the particle in a given region is found by integrating the probability density, `|ψ_n(x)|²`, over that region.\n*   The probability density for `n=2` is:\n    `P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|² = (sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n*   We need to find the probability of the particle being in the interval from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`. This is given by the integral:\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**3. Analyze the Interval and Identify Careful Points**\n*   **Careful Point 1: The interval is very small.** The width of the interval is `Δx = x2 - x1 = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The interval is centered at a node.** The center of the interval is `x_c = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`. For the `n=2` state, the point `x = 0.5a` is a node, which means the wavefunction and the probability density are zero at this point.\n    `P(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin²(2π * 0.5a / a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * (0)² = 0`\n*   **Implication:** A simple approximation like `Probability ≈ P(x_c) * Δx` would give an answer of 0, which is incorrect. The probability is very small, but not exactly zero. We must perform the integration carefully.\n\n**4. Perform the Exact Integration**\n*   To solve the integral, we use the trigonometric identity: `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2`.\n*   In our case, `θ = 2πx / a`, so `2θ = 4πx / a`.\n*   The integral becomes:\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) / 2 ] dx`\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/a) * (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx`\n*   Now, we find the antiderivative:\n    `∫ (1/a) * (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx = (1/a) * [x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)] = x/a - (1 / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)`\n*   Next, we evaluate this antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n    `Probability = [x/a - (1 / 4π)sin(4πx/a)]` from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n    `Probability = [ (0.505a/a) - (1/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a) ] - [ (0.495a/a) - (1/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a) ]`\n    `Probability = [ 0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π) ] - [ 0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π) ]`\n*   Group the terms:\n    `Probability = (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]`\n*   Use trigonometric properties `sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ)` and `sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ)`:\n    `sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n    `sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n*   Substitute these back into the expression:\n    `Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]`\n    `Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]`\n    `Probability = 0.01 - (1 / 2π) * sin(0.02π)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n*   **Careful Point 3: High-precision calculation needed.** The two terms in the expression, `0.01` and `(1/2π)sin(0.02π)`, are very close in value. Using a simple approximation like `sin(θ) ≈ θ` would lead to an inaccurate result of zero. We must use a calculator (in radians mode) or a more precise Taylor series expansion.\n*   Using a calculator:\n    *   `0.02π ≈ 0.06283185`\n    *   `sin(0.02π) ≈ 0.06282343`\n    *   `2π ≈ 6.2831853`\n    *   `Probability ≈ 0.01 - (1 / 6.2831853) * 0.06282343`\n    *   `Probability ≈ 0.01 - 0.1591549 * 0.06282343`\n    *   `Probability ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999342`\n    *   `Probability ≈ 0.00000658`\n\n*   **Alternative (Approximation Method):** Since the interval is small and centered on a node, we can approximate the probability density function `P(x)` with its Taylor series expansion around `x=0.5a`. This gives `P(x) ≈ (8π²/a³)(x - 0.5a)²`. Integrating this approximation over the interval yields:\n    `Probability ≈ (16π²/3)(0.005)³ ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶`. This confirms the result from the exact calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
