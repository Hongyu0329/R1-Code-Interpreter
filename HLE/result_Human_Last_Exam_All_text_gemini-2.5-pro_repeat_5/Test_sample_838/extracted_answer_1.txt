The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

This molecule is **achiral**. The initial stereochemistry of the starting material, [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, was lost in the first reaction step. The E2 elimination to form product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) destroyed the chiral center at C3. The subsequent hydroboration-oxidation and bromination steps were performed on achiral intermediates and did not introduce any new chiral centers. A molecule is chiral if it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane does not contain any chiral centers (i.e., a carbon atom attached to four different groups) and is superimposable on its mirror image, making it an achiral compound.
