The measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a single numerical value but is defined by a set of formal rules. For a single Grassmann variable $\eta$, these rules are:
1.  $\int d\eta \cdot 1 = 0$
2.  $\int d\eta \cdot \eta = 1$
These rules, operating on variables that have the inherent property $\eta^2=0$ (the mathematical statement of the Pauli exclusion principle), ensure that any term corresponding to a doubly-occupied state (involving $\eta^2$) evaluates to zero within the integral.
