    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario's Key Elements:**\n    *   **Position: The Button (BTN)**: This is the most profitable position in poker pre-flop. You are last to act (besides the blinds) and will have a positional advantage post-flop against any player who calls. This allows you to open a very wide range of hands profitably.\n    *   **Action: Open to 2.5x**: This is a standard opening size. The primary goal is to steal the blinds (Small Blind and Big Blind), and secondarily to play a pot in position with a stronger range than the blinds' defending ranges.\n    *   **Game Type: 100BB Rake-Free Cash Game**:\n        *   **100BB deep**: Standard stack depth means post-flop play, implied odds, and playability are all significant factors. This is not a short-stack push/fold situation.\n        *   **Rake-Free**: This is a critical and theoretical condition. In real-world poker, the house takes a percentage of the pot (the rake), which reduces the expected value (EV) of playing any hand. Rake particularly affects marginal, borderline hands. In a rake-free environment, any hand that is even slightly profitable (+0.01 BBs of EV) becomes a correct open-raise. This pushes the boundaries of our opening range to be much wider than in a standard raked game.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Hand Categories (Suited Jacks):**\n    We need to consider all possible suited jack hands and rank them by strength. The strength of a suited hand is determined by its high-card value, its ability to make straights (connectivity), and its ability to make flushes (suitedness). Since all hands in question are suited jacks, we focus on the kicker and connectivity.\n    *   **Premium Suited Jacks (AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs)**: These are very strong hands that can make the nut flush, strong straights, and strong top pairs. They are obvious opens from any position.\n    *   **Connected/Gapped Suited Jacks (J9s, J8s, J7s...)**: These hands have good playability. They can make strong flushes and a variety of straight draws. Their value decreases as the kicker gets lower, reducing the strength of a potential top pair and worsening the connectivity for straights.\n    *   **Weakest Suited Jacks (J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s)**: These have the lowest kickers and the worst connectivity. For example, J2s has a huge gap (a \"grand canyon\") and can only make a straight with A-K-Q-T or 3-4-5-6 (where the J2 is not very helpful). Its value comes primarily from its flush potential and pairing the jack.\n\n3.  **Determining the Opening Range Boundary:**\n    *   In a standard *raked* game, the button opening range is already very wide, often around 40-45% of hands. A GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solver might show the weakest suited jacks like J2s, J3s, and J4s as being mixed strategies (sometimes open, sometimes fold) or pure folds.\n    *   However, the **rake-free** condition is the deciding factor. Removing the rake makes every pot you win slightly larger, increasing the EV of playing. Hands that were break-even or slightly losing in a raked game become profitable opens.\n    *   Because of the immense advantage of playing in position from the button and the absence of rake, a GTO-based strategy would advocate for opening *all* suited jack combinations. The combination of trying to steal the 1.5BB in the pot, combined with the post-flop playability of a suited hand in position, makes even the weakest ones like J2s a profitable open-raise.\n\n4.  **Identifying the \"Worst\" Hand in the Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"worst suited jack you *should* open\".\n    *   Since our analysis concludes that you *should* open all suited jacks in this specific scenario (from AJs down to J2s), the \"worst\" one is simply the hand with the lowest intrinsic value and lowest expected value among them.\n    *   Comparing the bottom of the range:\n        *   **J3s** is better than J2s because the 3 offers slightly better straight connectivity (e.g., on an A-4-5 board).\n        *   **J4s** is better than J3s.\n        *   **J2s** is the weakest of all suited jacks. It has the lowest kicker, which means if you make a pair of jacks and your opponent also has a jack, you are likely to lose. It also has the worst straight-drawing potential.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the highly favorable conditions of opening from the button in a rake-free game, a theoretically sound strategy includes opening all suited jack combinations. The weakest hand within this category, and therefore the \"worst\" one that is still a standard open, is the one with the lowest kicker."
