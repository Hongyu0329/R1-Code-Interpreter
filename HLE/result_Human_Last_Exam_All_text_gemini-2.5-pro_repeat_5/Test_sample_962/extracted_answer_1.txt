This detailed design outlines a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol, based on the principles of the FROST scheme. It uses a Schnorr signature base, Pedersen VSS for key generation, and a carefully constructed two-round protocol with binding factors to ensure robustness and achieve a tight security proof.
