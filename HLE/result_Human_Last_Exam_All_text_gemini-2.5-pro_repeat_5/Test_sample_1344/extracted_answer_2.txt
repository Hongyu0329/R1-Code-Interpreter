The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst composed of a **Zirconium (Zr)** metal center, coordinated by two **pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*)** ligands, and supported on **sulfated zirconia (ZrO₂/SO₄²⁻)**. The catalyst is typically formed by grafting a precursor like bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dimethyl (`Cp*₂ZrMe₂`) onto the solid acid support.
