    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Input:**\n    *   We are given a polynomial equation intended to define a Calabi-Yau manifold (specifically, a singularity whose link is of interest):\n        $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n    *   The variables $(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$ exist in an ambient space defined by the weights $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$. This describes a hypersurface in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n    *   The number of variables is $N=5$. In the notation often used, this corresponds to $n+1=5$, so $n=4$.\n\n2.  **Verify Weighted Homogeneity:**\n    For a polynomial to be well-defined on a weighted projective space, it must be weighted homogeneous. This means every monomial term in the polynomial must have the same weighted degree, $d$. The weighted degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}z_3^{a_3}z_4^{a_4}z_5^{a_5}$ is calculated as $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i w_i$.\n    Let's calculate the degree for each term:\n    *   $w(z_1^8z_3) = 8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n    *   $w(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n    *   $w(z_1z_2^7) = 1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1(22) + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n    *   $w(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n    *   $w(z_2z_3^4) = 1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n    *   $w(z_4^3z_5) = 3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   $w(z_5^3) = 3 \\cdot w_5 = 3(75) = 225$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1:** We observe that all terms have a weighted degree of $d=225$, except for the second term, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, which has a degree of 224. This indicates a typo in the problem statement's polynomial. However, for the definition of the Crawley-Nordström invariant of a Calabi-Yau link, the exact form of the polynomial is not needed, only its degree $d$ and the weights $w_i$. We will proceed assuming the intended degree is $d=225$.\n\n3.  **Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition:**\n    A hypersurface in a weighted projective space is called \"Calabi-Yau\" if its first Chern class is zero. This translates to the condition that the degree of the polynomial equals the sum of the weights: $d = \\sum w_i$.\n    *   From our analysis, the intended degree is $d=225$.\n    *   Let's sum the weights: $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   Since $d = \\sum w_i$, the Calabi-Yau condition is satisfied.\n\n    **Careful Point 2:** This confirmation is crucial as it allows the use of a simplified formula for the invariant.\n\n4.  **State the Formula for the Crawley-Nordström Invariant:**\n    The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the link of a quasi-smooth singularity defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial in $\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ is given by:\n    $\\text{CN}(L_f) = \\frac{1}{d \\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} w_i} \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} (d-2w_i)$.\n    For the special case of a Calabi-Yau manifold where $d = \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} w_i$, the sum simplifies:\n    $\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} (d-2w_i) = (n+1)d - 2\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} w_i = (n+1)d - 2d = (n-1)d$.\n    Substituting this back into the main formula gives a much simpler expression for the Calabi-Yau case:\n    $\\text{CN}(L_f) = \\frac{(n-1)d}{d \\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} w_i} = \\frac{n-1}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} w_i}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Invariant:**\n    We apply the simplified formula using our parameters:\n    *   $n=4$ (since there are $n+1=5$ variables).\n    *   The numerator is $n-1 = 4-1 = 3$.\n    *   The denominator is the product of the weights: $\\prod_{i=1}^5 w_i = 22 \\times 29 \\times 49 \\times 50 \\times 75$.\n\n    **Careful Point 3:** Perform the multiplication accurately.\n    *   $22 \\times 29 = 638$\n    *   $638 \\times 49 = 31,262$\n    *   $31,262 \\times 50 = 1,563,100$\n    *   $1,563,100 \\times 75 = 117,232,500$\n\n    So, the invariant is $\\text{CN} = \\frac{3}{117,232,500}$.\n\n6.  **Simplify the Result:**\n    **Careful Point 4:** The final answer should be given as a simplified fraction.\n    *   We check if the denominator is divisible by the numerator (3). The sum of the digits of the denominator is $1+1+7+2+3+2+5+0+0 = 21$, which is divisible by 3.\n    *   $117,232,500 \\div 3 = 39,077,500$.\n    *   Therefore, the simplified fraction is $\\frac{1}{39,077,500}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final calculated value for the Crawley-Nordström invariant is $\\frac{1}{39,077,500}$.\n\n<<<1/39077500>>>"
