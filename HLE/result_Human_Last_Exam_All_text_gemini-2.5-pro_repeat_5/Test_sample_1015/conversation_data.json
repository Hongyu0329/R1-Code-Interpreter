    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Movement**\nA *cambré derrière* is a fundamental ballet movement meaning \"arched to the back.\" It involves bending the torso backwards from the waist, requiring flexibility in the spine, core strength, and proper alignment.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method Approach**\nThe Vaganova method, known for its precision and anatomical correctness, emphasizes a specific way to execute the cambré derrière:\n*   **Initiation:** The movement is initiated by lifting the chest and sternum towards the ceiling. The dancer lengthens the spine upwards before beginning the backward bend.\n*   **Spinal Articulation:** The bend occurs primarily in the upper and middle back (thoracic spine). The lower back (lumbar spine) is supported and engaged but not hyper-compressed.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is a crucial point. In the Vaganova technique, the hips must remain stable and directly aligned over the supporting leg(s). There is no forward push of the pelvis. The goal is to create a pure, long arc with the spine without breaking the line at the hips.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, lifting to look up and back. The arms (port de bras) are held in a precise, harmonious shape, often moving through a preparatory position before reaching fifth en haut (high fifth) and framing the face as the bend occurs.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method Approach**\nThe Balanchine method, or style, is characterized by speed, energy, and extended lines, often pushing the boundaries of classical technique for aesthetic effect.\n*   **Initiation:** The movement is often quicker and more dynamic, with less emphasis on the slow, upward lift before the bend.\n*   **Spinal Articulation:** The bend is often deeper and more extreme, utilizing the dancer's full range of motion.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the most significant point of divergence from the Vaganova method. In the Balanchine style, to achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the dancer is often encouraged to press the hips *forward*. This creates a \"broken\" line at the hips but allows the upper body to counterbalance and fall further back. This forward hip placement is a defining characteristic of the Balanchine aesthetic in many movements.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The port de bras and head position can be more stylized and less strictly codified than in Vaganova. The focus is on creating a long, dynamic line that complements the music and choreography.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While arm placement differs between the styles (Vaganova is more rounded and classical, Balanchine can be more angular), this is not the most fundamental difference in the mechanics of the cambré itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the key mechanical difference. Vaganova keeps the hips stacked vertically over the feet. Balanchine allows or encourages a forward press of the hips. This fundamentally changes the shape, balance, and execution of the movement.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine choreography is famously fast, a cambré is an adagio (slow) movement by nature. The speed of its execution is a choreographic choice rather than a defining technical difference in how the movement itself is taught.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** A Balanchine cambré might appear deeper, but this is a *result* of the technique used, specifically the forward hip placement. The degree of the bend is dependent on individual flexibility and is not the root cause of the difference. The *method* of achieving that degree is the core distinction.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** Head placement is important in both methods, but the rules are part of the overall coordination (epaulement). The difference in hip placement creates a much more significant structural and visual difference in the entire pose.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most defining and critical difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the action and placement of the hips. Vaganova prioritizes vertical alignment and spinal articulation, while Balanchine uses a forward hip press to achieve a more extreme and dynamic line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
