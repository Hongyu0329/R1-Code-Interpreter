    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Factor the conductor**\nThe first step is to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test for small prime factors.\n*   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$.\n*   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$.\n*   $589 \\div 19 = 31$.\n*   The numbers 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all prime numbers.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n*   **Careful point:** The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer, which simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n**2. Understand the structure of primitive characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is a function from integers to complex numbers. Its conductor is the smallest modulus for which it is defined. A character is primitive if its conductor is equal to its modulus $d$.\n*   For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of non-trivial characters modulo each prime factor:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\dots \\chi_{p_k}$\n    where each $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a character modulo $p_i$ and is not the principal (trivial) character.\n*   In our case, a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $53599$ must be of the form $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a non-trivial character modulo $p$ for each $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n*   **Careful point:** For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial. The only non-primitive character is the trivial one, which has conductor 1.\n\n**3. Analyze the order of the character**\nThe order of a character $\\chi$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\chi^k$ is the principal character.\n*   The order of a product character $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\dots \\chi_{p_k}$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1}), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_k}))$.\n*   We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. Thus, we need:\n    $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n*   **Careful point:** This condition implies two things for the orders $o_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$:\n    a) Every $o_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n    b) The set of orders $\\{o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}\\}$ must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\n**4. Determine the possible orders of component characters**\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n*   Let's check the orders of the character groups for our primes:\n    *   For $p=7$: group order is $7-1=6$.\n    *   For $p=13$: group order is $13-1=12$.\n    *   For $p=19$: group order is $19-1=18$.\n    *   For $p=31$: group order is $31-1=30$.\n*   From step 3, the order $o_p$ of each non-trivial component character $\\chi_p$ must be a divisor of 6, and greater than 1. So, $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   For each of our primes $p$, $p-1$ is a multiple of 6. Therefore, characters of order 2, 3, and 6 exist for each prime factor.\n*   **Careful point:** We must confirm that characters of the required orders exist for each prime factor. In this case, they do.\n\n**5. Count the number of component characters for each possible order**\nFor any of our primes $p$, the number of non-trivial characters $\\chi_p$ with order $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\n**6. Combine the results using combinatorial counting**\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ that satisfy the conditions. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion (or complementary counting).\n\n*   **Total combinations where orders divide 6:**\n    First, let's count the total number of ways to choose one non-trivial character $\\chi_p$ for each prime $p$ such that its order divides 6. For each prime, the number of such characters is the sum of the counts for orders 2, 3, and 6:\n    Number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ = $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are four primes, the total number of combinations of such characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$. This count includes all tuples where the lcm of orders is a divisor of 6 (and > 1).\n\n*   **Exclude combinations where the lcm is not 6:**\n    We need the lcm to be exactly 6. We must subtract the cases where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6, which means the lcm is 2 or 3 (it cannot be 1 as characters are non-trivial).\n    *   **Case 1: lcm divides 2.** This occurs if and only if the order of every component character $\\chi_p$ is 2.\n        For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n        Number of combinations with lcm=2 is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **Case 2: lcm divides 3.** This occurs if and only if the order of every component character $\\chi_p$ is 3.\n        For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n        Number of combinations with lcm=3 is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Final calculation:**\n    The number of characters with order exactly 6 is the total count minus the counts for the unwanted cases.\n    Number of characters = (Total combinations) - (Combinations with lcm=2) - (Combinations with lcm=3)\n    Number = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n*   **Careful point:** The set of character tuples whose orders are all 2 and the set of tuples whose orders are all 3 are disjoint, so we can simply subtract their counts from the total.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$ is the number of 4-tuples of non-trivial characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ whose orders have a least common multiple of 6. The calculation above shows this number to be 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
