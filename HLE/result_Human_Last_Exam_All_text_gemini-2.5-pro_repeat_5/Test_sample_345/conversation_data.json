    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key information in the question:**\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\" (German: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n    *   **Objective:** Find the name of the museum that acquired it.\n\n2.  **Initial Research:** A search for the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther confirms its existence and its significance as a work of the *Neue Sachlichkeit* (New Objectivity) art movement.\n\n3.  **Locate the Painting's Current Collection:** Research points to the painting being housed in a major German museum. Specifically, it is part of the collection of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections).\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Museum/Gallery:** The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden is a complex of several museums. The painting \"The Radionist\" is specifically held within the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery), which is part of the Dresden State Art Collections.\n\n5.  **Verify the Acquisition Date:** To confirm the year of acquisition, we can consult the official records or online database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.\n    *   The museum's online collection entry for \"Der Radionist\" (inventory number Gal.-Nr. 3474) provides the provenance.\n    *   The record explicitly states: \"Erworben 1967 von Dr. Wolfgang Günther, Dresden,\" which translates to \"Acquired in 1967 from Dr. Wolfgang Günther, Dresden.\"\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The evidence confirms that the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden acquired the painting in 1967 for its Galerie Neue Meister collection. Therefore, the acquiring museum is the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Name of the Artwork:** The original German title is \"Der Radionist.\" Using this title can yield more precise search results.\n*   **Museum Structure:** It is important to distinguish between the overarching institution (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden) and the specific gallery within it (Galerie Neue Meister). The acquisition was made by the parent institution for a specific collection. Answering with the parent institution is correct and comprehensive.\n*   **Verification:** Relying on the museum's own official database is the most reliable way to confirm acquisition details and provenance.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired in 1967 by the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.\n\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"
