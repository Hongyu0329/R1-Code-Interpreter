The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when tested with a VNA and a probe is due to its active decoupling circuitry. Modern coils are designed to be in a "fail-safe," detuned state by default to protect them during RF transmission. This decoupling is often controlled by PIN diodes that require a specific DC bias from the MRI scanner to switch the coil into its resonant "receive" mode. Without this bias during a bench test, the coil remains intentionally non-resonant. Other contributing factors include the need for integrated preamplifiers to be powered on to present the correct impedance for tuning, and complex coil geometries (e.g., phased arrays, balanced circuits) that may not couple effectively with a simple, single-ended probe.
