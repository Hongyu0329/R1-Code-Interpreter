No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to send a signal to natural predators, primarily birds. Human vision differs fundamentally from avian vision, especially in the inability to perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is a key component of many bee color patterns. Therefore, how humans group species by similarity is not a reliable proxy for how predators do. The use of untrained assessors and non-standardized images further undermines the method's scientific rigor.
