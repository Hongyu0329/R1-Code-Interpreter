    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the character who describes the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The question asks for a specific character in *The House of the Wolfings* who meets two criteria:\n    *   They visited a Roman city.\n    *   They describe a Roman religious practice in a way that clearly refers to the myth of Romulus and Remus (two children suckled by a wolf).\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **The Book's Context:** *The House of the Wolfings* is set during the late Roman Empire and depicts the conflict between a Gothic tribe (the Wolfings) and the encroaching Roman legions. This context makes interactions between the Goths and Romans a central theme.\n    *   **The Specific Myth:** The reference to Romulus and Remus is the most crucial clue. The myth involves two infant brothers, the legendary founders of Rome, who were abandoned and then nursed by a she-wolf. A description of this would involve a wolf and two babies.\n    *   **Character Experience:** To describe a Roman city and its religious imagery, a character must have spent time among the Romans. We need to identify a character who was a captive, a traveler, or had some other form of direct contact.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer:**\n    *   **Step 1: Scan the major characters for Roman contact.** The protagonist is Thiodolf, chief of the Wolfings. Most of his interactions with Romans are hostile and on the battlefield. However, the narrative introduces a character who has lived among the Romans: his foster-daughter.\n    *   **Step 2: Identify the character with experience in the Roman world.** This character is **Thora**. She was taken captive by the Romans in her youth and lived in one of their cities before being returned to the Wolfings. Her past experience makes her the primary source of information about Roman life and customs within the tribe.\n    *   **Step 3: Locate the specific scene of the description.** In Chapter VI of the book, titled \"Thora tells of the Romans,\" Thora is asked to describe the enemy. She speaks of their power, their cities, and their gods.\n    *   **Step 4: Analyze Thora's description.** During her account, Thora explicitly describes an image she saw that the reader will immediately recognize. She tells the Wolfings:\n        > \"Yea, and I have seen the image of their God of the Wolf, and his two children whom the she-wolf fostered; for he is the first Father of all their tribes.\"\n    *   **Step 5: Connect the description to the myth.** This passage is a direct and unmistakable reference to the Capitoline Wolf, the famous statue depicting the she-wolf suckling the infants Romulus and Remus. Thora interprets this founding myth as the Romans having a \"God of the Wolf,\" which is particularly striking to her audience, the Wolfing tribe, who see the wolf as their ancestor and totem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms that the character who visited a Roman city and described their foundation myth is Thora, Thiodolf's foster-daughter.\n\n<<<Thora>>>"
