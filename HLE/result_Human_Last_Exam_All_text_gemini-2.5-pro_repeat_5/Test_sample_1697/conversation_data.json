    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n*   Let's break down the name to draw its structure:\n    *   \"Benzamide\" indicates a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group which is, in turn, attached to a nitrogen atom (-C(=O)N-).\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl-\" means two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. This gives us the -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂ group.\n    *   \"3-dimethylamino-\" means a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is at the 3-position (meta position) relative to the main benzamide functional group.\n*   The structure is a benzene ring with a -C(=O)N(Et)₂ group at position 1 and a -N(Me)₂ group at position 3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Deprotonation)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium), TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine), and THF (tetrahydrofuran).\n*   **Function of Reagents:**\n    *   **sec-BuLi** is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary role is to abstract a proton (deprotonation), usually the most acidic one.\n    *   **TMEDA** is a chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It complexes with sec-BuLi, breaking up its aggregates and increasing its basicity. More importantly, it helps in a process called **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**.\n    *   **THF** is the polar aprotic solvent for the reaction.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism (Directed ortho-Metalation):**\n    *   In the starting molecule, there are two functional groups that can act as **Directed Metalating Groups (DMGs)**: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂).\n    *   DMGs have heteroatoms with lone pairs (like O or N) that can coordinate to the lithium ion of the organolithium reagent. This coordination brings the base (the butyl part of sec-BuLi) close to a proton on the ortho position of the ring, facilitating its removal.\n    *   The **amide group (-CONEt₂) is one of the most powerful DMGs**. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n    *   The **amino group (-NMe₂) is also a good DMG**. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n*   **Determining the Site of Deprotonation:**\n    *   The position C2 is ortho to *both* the amide group and the amino group.\n    *   When two DMGs are located meta to each other, they act **synergistically** to direct the deprotonation to the position between them.\n    *   The lithium ion can be chelated by both the carbonyl oxygen of the amide and the nitrogen of the amino group, forming a stable five-membered ring intermediate. This geometry strongly favors the abstraction of the proton at the C2 position.\n    *   Therefore, the sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C2 position, replacing the hydrogen atom with a lithium atom to form an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Alkylation)**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   **Function of Reagent:** Methyl iodide is an excellent electrophile for methylation reactions. The carbon atom in the methyl group is electron-deficient.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The aryllithium species formed in the first step has a highly nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position (it's essentially a carbanion).\n    *   This nucleophilic carbon attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I in a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Sₙ2 type).\n    *   The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group.\n    *   As a result, a methyl group (-CH₃) becomes attached to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Product**\n\n*   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, we have added a methyl group at the C2 position.\n*   The final compound's structure has the N,N-diethylamide group at C1, a new methyl group at C2, and the dimethylamino group at C3.\n*   Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, we name the substituents alphabetically (dimethylamino, methyl).\n*   The name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Correctly identify the functional groups** and their properties in the starting material.\n2.  **Recognize the reaction type:** This is a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n3.  **Identify the strongest directing group:** The amide group is a more powerful DMG than the amino group.\n4.  **Look for synergistic directing effects:** The meta-disposed DMGs strongly direct lithiation to the C2 position between them due to chelation.\n5.  **Understand the role of the electrophile:** Methyl iodide serves to add a methyl group to the site of lithiation.\n6.  **Correctly name the final product** based on the positions of all substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide>>>"
