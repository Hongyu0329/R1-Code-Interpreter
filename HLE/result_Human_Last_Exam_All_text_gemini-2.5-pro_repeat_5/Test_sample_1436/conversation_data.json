    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Diagram's Topology\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with the following characteristics:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's label them `v1` and `v2`.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In a Feynman diagram, a field contraction between two spacetime points (vertices) is represented by a line, called a propagator.\nThis means the diagram consists of two vertices, `v1` and `v2`, and four distinct propagator lines connecting them.\n\nVisually, the diagram looks like this:\n```\n      /-----\\\n     /       \\\nv1 --<       >-- v2\n     \\       /\n      \\-----/\n```\n(This is a 2D representation; there are four separate lines connecting `v1` and `v2`). This diagram is a vacuum bubble diagram that appears at the two-loop order in a theory with a suitable interaction.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Symmetry Factor\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by `S`, is a purely combinatorial number associated with a Feynman diagram. It corrects for the overcounting that occurs when we generate diagrams from the perturbative expansion of the Green's function. The contribution of a specific diagram topology is proportional to `1/S`.\n\nThe symmetry factor `S` is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the diagram. An automorphism is a permutation of the diagram's elements (vertices and lines) that leaves the diagram's structure unchanged. We need to identify all such symmetry operations and count them.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nWe analyze the topological symmetries of the graph described in Step 1.\n\n1.  **Line Permutations:**\n    The four lines (propagators) all connect the same two vertices, `v1` and `v2`. Assuming they correspond to the same type of field (which is standard unless specified otherwise), these four lines are indistinguishable from each other. We can swap any of these four lines with any other, and the diagram remains identical. The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is given by the number of permutations of 4 items, which is `4!` (4 factorial).\n    *   Number of line permutations = `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.\n\n2.  **Vertex Permutations:**\n    The two vertices, `v1` and `v2`, are also topologically equivalent. Each vertex is connected to the other by the same four lines. Therefore, we can swap the labels of the vertices (`v1` ↔ `v2`), and the diagram's structure is unchanged. The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is `2!`.\n    *   Number of vertex permutations = `2! = 2 × 1 = 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the number of all independent symmetry operations. The line permutations and vertex permutations are independent operations.\n\n*   `S = (Number of line permutations) × (Number of vertex permutations)`\n*   `S = 4! × 2!`\n*   `S = 24 × 2`\n*   `S = 48`\n\n### Alternative Verification (Wick Contraction Method)\n\nLet's assume the vertices arise from a `λφ⁴` interaction, where the interaction Lagrangian is `L_int = - (λ/4!) φ⁴`. The diagram arises from the second-order term in the expansion of the exponential `exp(iS_int)`.\n\nThe term contributing to the diagram is:\n`1/2! * ( -iλ / 4! )² ∫d⁴x₁ d⁴x₂ < T{ φ(x₁)^4 φ(x₂)^4 } >`\n\nWe need to count the number of ways (`C`) to form the diagram by contracting the four `φ` fields at `x₁` with the four `φ` fields at `x₂`.\n*   Take the first `φ` at `x₁`: It can be contracted with any of the 4 fields at `x₂`. (4 ways)\n*   Take the second `φ` at `x₁`: It can be contracted with any of the remaining 3 fields at `x₂`. (3 ways)\n*   Take the third `φ` at `x₁`: It can be contracted with any of the remaining 2 fields at `x₂`. (2 ways)\n*   Take the last `φ` at `x₁`: It must contract with the last remaining field at `x₂`. (1 way)\nThe total number of ways to form these contractions is `C = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 4! = 24`.\n\nThe overall numerical coefficient of the diagram is `(1/S) = (1/2!) * (1/4!)² * C`.\n`1/S = (1/2) * (1/24)² * 24 = (1/2) * (1/24) = 1/48`\nTherefore, the symmetry factor `S = 48`. Both methods yield the same result.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Diagram Interpretation:** Correctly identify the number of vertices and the number of lines connecting them.\n*   **Indistinguishability:** Recognize that lines connecting the same two vertices are identical, and vertices that have identical connections are also identical from a topological standpoint.\n*   **Interaction Type:** The calculation relies on the assumption of a vertex type where multiple fields are interchangeable (like in `φ⁴` theory). The `k!` in `φ^k/k!` is crucial, and the counting methods implicitly assume this standard form.\n*   **Independence of Symmetries:** Ensure that the counted symmetries (line and vertex permutations) are independent to avoid double counting. In this case, they are.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the symmetry factor is the product of the factorial of the number of identical lines and the factorial of the number of identical vertices.\n\n<<<48>>>"
