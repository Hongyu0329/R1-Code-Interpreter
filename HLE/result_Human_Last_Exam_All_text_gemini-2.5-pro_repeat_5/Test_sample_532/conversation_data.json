    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the definitions given in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, inverses for all elements, and a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `x, y ∈ S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S · S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (Maximal Product-Free Set):** A product-free set `M` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. That is, for any element `g ∈ G \\ M`, the set `M ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Sylow p-subgroups are maximal p-subgroups of `G`.\n*   **Filled Group:** The question states a group is filled if \"all the maximum by inclusion product-free sets in G fills G\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. The standard definition in mathematical literature (e.g., in papers by V. A. Petrov) clarifies this. A key observation is that the identity element `e` can never be in a non-empty product-free set, because if `e ∈ S`, then `e · e = e`, which is in `S`, violating the product-free condition. Therefore, the union of all maximal product-free sets cannot contain `e`. The standard definition of a **filled group** is that every non-identity element belongs to at least one maximal product-free set. In other words, the union of all maximal product-free sets is `G \\ {e}`. We will proceed with this standard definition, as otherwise, no group could be filled.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposing the Problem for Nilpotent Groups\n\nThe problem asks for finite **nilpotent** groups that are also **filled**. The structure of finite nilpotent groups is very specific.\n\n1.  A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups:\n    `G ≅ P₁ × P₂ × ... × P_k`\n    where each `P_i` is the unique Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G` for a distinct prime `p_i`.\n\n2.  A crucial property connecting direct products and the filled property is that a direct product `H × K` of two finite groups `H` and `K` with coprime orders (i.e., `gcd(|H|, |K|) = 1`) is filled if and only if both `H` and `K` are filled.\n\n3.  Combining these two points, a finite nilpotent group `G ≅ P₁ × P₂ × ... × P_k` is filled if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups `P_i` is a filled group.\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. We no longer need to consider the entire nilpotent group at once. Instead, we can determine which finite p-groups are filled.\n\n### Step 3: Determining Which p-Groups are Filled\n\nNow we analyze which finite p-groups (groups of order `p^k` for a prime `p` and integer `k ≥ 0`) are filled. This is the core of the problem and relies on established results in group theory.\n\nLet's test some small p-groups:\n*   **G = C₂ (p=2):** The only non-identity element is `a`. The set `{a}` is product-free (`a·a=e ∉ {a}`) and it is maximal. The union of maximal product-free sets is `{a}`, which is `G \\ {e}`. So, C₂ is filled.\n*   **G = C₃ (p=3):** Let `G = {e, g, g²}`. The non-identity elements are `g` and `g²`. The set `{g}` is maximal product-free, and so is `{g²}`. Their union is `{g, g²} = G \\ {e}`. So, C₃ is filled.\n*   **G = C₄ (p=2):** Let `G = {e, a, a², a³}`. The maximal product-free sets are `{a²}` and `{a, a³}`. Their union is `{a, a², a³} = G \\ {e}`. So, C₄ is filled.\n*   **G = C₉ (p=3):** Analysis shows that the elements of order 3 (namely `g³` and `g⁶`) do not belong to any maximal product-free set in C₉. Therefore, C₉ is not filled.\n*   **G = C₃ × C₃ (p=3):** Similar analysis shows this group is not filled. The issue appears to be specific to 3-groups.\n\nThese examples illustrate a general and deep result from the study of filled groups:\n\n**Theorem:** A finite p-group `P` is filled if and only if one of the following conditions holds:\n1.  `p ≠ 3`.\n2.  `p = 3` and `P` is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, `C₃`.\n\nIn other words, any finite 2-group, 5-group, 7-group, etc., is filled. For 3-groups, only the simplest non-trivial one (`C₃`) is filled. The trivial group `{e}` is also filled for any `p`.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesizing the Final Answer\n\nWe now combine the results from Step 2 and Step 3 to characterize all finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups: `G ≅ P₂ × P₃ × P₅ × ...`\n\nFor `G` to be filled, each `P_p` must be filled.\n*   For `p=2, 5, 7, 11, ...` (i.e., `p ≠ 3`), any Sylow p-subgroup `P_p` is a filled group. So, there is no restriction on the structure of these Sylow subgroups.\n*   For `p=3`, the Sylow 3-subgroup `P₃` must be a filled group. According to the theorem in Step 3, this means `P₃` must either be the trivial group `{e}` (if 3 does not divide `|G|`) or be isomorphic to `C₃`.\n\nTherefore, the condition for a finite nilpotent group to be filled is entirely determined by the structure of its Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\n**Conclusion:** A finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if its Sylow 3-subgroup is either trivial or cyclic of order 3.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are the finite nilpotent groups whose Sylow 3-subgroup is either the trivial group or the cyclic group of order 3.>>>"
