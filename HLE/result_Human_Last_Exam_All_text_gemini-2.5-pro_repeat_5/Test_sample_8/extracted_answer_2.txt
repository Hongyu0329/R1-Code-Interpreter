The resolvent $R(\sigma)$ is the inverse of the operator $P = -\Delta_g - \sigma^2$. On the radial compactification $X$, $P$ is an elliptic scattering differential operator of order 2. The theory of such operators shows that its inverse, $R(\sigma)$, is a scattering pseudodifferential operator of order -2. A scattering pseudodifferential operator of order $k$ maps the conormal space $\mathcal{A}^s(X)$ to $\mathcal{A}^{s-k}(X)$. In this case, $f \in \mathcal{A}^{2+\alpha}(X)$ and the operator $R(\sigma)$ has order $k=-2$. Therefore, $R(\sigma)f$ belongs to the space $\mathcal{A}^{(2+\alpha)-(-2)}(X) = \mathcal{A}^{4+\alpha}(X)$.
