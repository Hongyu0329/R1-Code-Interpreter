    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem Setup\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n-   The DFT of `x(n)` is `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\n-   The DFT of `h(n)` is `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n\nWe need to find the DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Question\nThe question asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. This is an ambiguous statement, as a 4-point DFT is defined for a 4-point sequence. In Digital Signal Processing, this typically implies one of two standard operations. The most common interpretation, which relates the DFTs of different lengths, is finding the DFT of a time-aliased version of the sequence.\n\nLet's define a 4-point sequence `z(n)` by aliasing (folding and adding) the 8-point sequence `y(n)`:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nA fundamental property of the DFT states that the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`, let's call it `Z(k)`, is equal to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, which we'll call `Y(k)`.\n`Z(k) = DFT_4{z(n)} = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nSo, our goal is to first find the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` of the interleaved sequence `y(n)`, and then extract the samples at indices `k=0, 2, 4, 6`.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the 8-point DFT to the given 4-point DFTs\nThe interleaved sequence `y(n)` has its even-indexed samples from `x(n)` and its odd-indexed samples from `h(n)`.\n-   Even part: `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n-   Odd part: `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThis is the standard setup for the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be calculated from the 4-point DFTs of the even and odd parts (`X(k)` and `H(k)`) using the following formulas:\n-   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n-   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nHere, `W_N^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/N)` is the DFT twiddle factor. We need `W_8^k`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Samples of the 8-point DFT\nWe need to find `Z(k) = [Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)]`.\n\n**Calculation for Z(0) = Y(0) and Z(2) = Y(4):**\nThese are found by setting `k=0` in the DIT formulas.\n-   `X(0) = 1`\n-   `H(0) = 0`\n-   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n\n`Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n`Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\nSo, `Z(0) = 1` and `Z(2) = 1`.\n\n**Calculation for Z(1) = Y(2) and Z(3) = Y(6):**\nThese are found by setting `k=2` in the DIT formulas.\n-   `X(2) = -1`\n-   `H(2) = 1`\n-   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*pi*2/8) = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n\n`Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n`Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\nSo, `Z(1) = -1 - j` and `Z(3) = -1 + j`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nBy assembling the calculated values, we get the 4-point DFT `Z(k)`.\n-   `Z(0) = Y(0) = 1`\n-   `Z(1) = Y(2) = -1 - j`\n-   `Z(2) = Y(4) = 1`\n-   `Z(3) = Y(6) = -1 + j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
