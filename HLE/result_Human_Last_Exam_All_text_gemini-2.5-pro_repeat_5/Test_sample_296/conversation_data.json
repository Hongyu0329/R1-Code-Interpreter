    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Γ).\n\n### Step 1: Relate Subgroups of Index 4 to Group Actions\n\nA subgroup `H` of a group `Γ` has an index of 4 if the set of left cosets `Γ/H` has 4 elements. The action of `Γ` on this set of cosets by left multiplication defines a homomorphism `φ: Γ → S_4`, where `S_4` is the symmetric group on 4 elements. The image of this homomorphism, `im(φ)`, is a transitive subgroup of `S_4`. Conversely, any transitive action of `Γ` on a set of 4 elements gives rise to a subgroup of index 4 (the stabilizer of a point).\n\n### Step 2: Constrain the Image of the Action Using Properties of Γ\n\nThe Grigorchuk group `Γ` has several key properties. The most important one for this problem is that it is a residually finite 2-group. This means that any finite quotient of `Γ` is a finite 2-group (a group whose order is a power of 2).\nSince `im(φ)` is a finite quotient of `Γ`, its order must be a power of 2. The transitive subgroups of `S_4` are:\n*   `C_4` (cyclic group of order 4)\n*   `V_4` (Klein four-group, order 4)\n*   `D_8` (dihedral group of order 8, a Sylow 2-subgroup of `S_4`)\n*   `A_4` (alternating group, order 12)\n*   `S_4` (symmetric group, order 24)\n\nSince `im(φ)` must be a 2-group, we can eliminate `A_4` and `S_4`. The possible images are `C_4`, `V_4`, and `D_8`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Nature of the Group Action (Primitive vs. Imprimitive)\n\nA transitive group action is either primitive or imprimitive.\n*   An action of `Γ` on `Γ/H` is **primitive** if there is no intermediate subgroup `M` such that `H ⊂ M ⊂ Γ`. If the action is primitive, then `im(φ)` must be a primitive subgroup of `S_4`.\n*   The primitive subgroups of `S_4` are `A_4` and `S_4`. As we established in Step 2, neither of these can be the image of `φ` because they are not 2-groups.\n*   Therefore, the action of `Γ` on the cosets of any index-4 subgroup `H` **must be imprimitive**.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Imprimitive Property to Deduce Subgroup Structure\n\nThe action being imprimitive means there must be an intermediate subgroup `M` such that `H ⊂ M ⊂ Γ`.\nBy the Tower Law for group indices, `|Γ:H| = |Γ:M| ⋅ |M:H|`.\nSince `|Γ:H| = 4` and `M` is a proper subgroup containing `H`, the only possibility for the indices is `|Γ:M| = 2` and `|M:H| = 2`.\n\nThis tells us that every subgroup `H` of index 4 must be contained in a subgroup `M` of index 2.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Unique Index-2 Subgroup of Γ\n\nIt is a fundamental property of the Grigorchuk group `Γ` that it has a **unique subgroup of index 2**. This subgroup is the stabilizer of the first level of the infinite binary tree on which `Γ` acts, commonly denoted `Stab_Γ(1)`.\n\nSince there is only one choice for the intermediate subgroup `M`, we can conclude that **every subgroup of index 4 in Γ must be a subgroup of `Stab_Γ(1)`**.\n\n### Step 6: Reduce the Problem to Counting Subgroups of `Stab_Γ(1)`\n\nWe have established that finding subgroups `H` of index 4 in `Γ` is equivalent to finding subgroups `H` of `Stab_Γ(1)` such that `|M:H| = |Stab_Γ(1):H| = 2`.\nSo, the problem is now reduced to a simpler one: **how many subgroups of index 2 does `Stab_Γ(1)` have?**\n\n### Step 7: Use Abelianization to Count Index-2 Subgroups\n\nThe number of subgroups of index 2 in any finitely generated group `G` is given by `2^k - 1`, where `k` is the rank of the elementary abelian 2-group component of its abelianization `G^{ab} = G/[G,G]`.\nIt is a well-known result in the study of the Grigorchuk group that the abelianization of the first-level stabilizer is:\n`Stab_Γ(1)^{ab} ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_2`\nThis is an elementary abelian 2-group of rank `k=3`.\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nUsing the formula from the previous step, the number of subgroups of index 2 in `Stab_Γ(1)` is:\n`2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7`.\n\nSince each of these 7 subgroups of `Stab_Γ(1)` is a subgroup of index 4 in `Γ`, and we have shown that all index-4 subgroups must be of this form, the total number is 7.\n\nFinal Answer: The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\n<<<7>>>"
