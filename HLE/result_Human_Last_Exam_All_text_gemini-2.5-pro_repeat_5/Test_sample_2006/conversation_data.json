    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the problem lies in correctly interpreting each part of the prompt.\n1.  **The Title as a Question:** The title is \"The Bays\". This is a homophone for \"The B's\". The question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\".\n2.  **The Haiku as the Answer:** The haiku itself provides the answer to the question \"What are the B's?\". Since a haiku has three lines, it's logical to assume it's describing three things that start with the letter 'B'.\n3.  **The Final Instruction:** The answer, once found, must be presented \"in alphabetical order\". This implies taking all the letters of the answer words, combining them, and sorting them alphabetically to form a single string.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Line of the Haiku**\nWe will analyze each line to find a word that starts with 'B' and matches the description.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent storm characterized by strong winds.\n    *   A powerful gust of wind is often called a \"blow\".\n    *   The corresponding 'B' word is **BLOW**.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is mathematically 2 * 15 = 30.\n    *   In Roman numerals, the number 30 is represented as XXX.\n    *   The symbol \"XXX\" is commonly used to mark choices on a voting form, or **BALLOT**.\n    *   The phrase \"winds of change\" is a classic metaphor for the political and social shifts that result from elections.\n    *   The corresponding 'B' word is **BALLOT**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to a god or a higher power.\n    *   \"Yields\" means to give or to provide.\n    *   Something given by a divine being as a gift or a blessing is called a \"boon\".\n    *   The corresponding 'B' word is **BOON**.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble and Process the Final Answer**\nNow that we have the three 'B' words, we must follow the final instruction.\n\n1.  **The Answer Words:** The three \"B's\" are BLOW, BALLOT, and BOON.\n2.  **Combine the Letters:** We take all the letters from these three words:\n    B, L, O, W, B, A, L, L, O, T, B, O, O, N\n3.  **Sort the Letters:** We arrange these letters in alphabetical order.\n    *   A: 1\n    *   B: 3\n    *   L: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 4\n    *   T: 1\n    *   W: 1\n4.  **Form the Final String:** Placing these sorted letters together in a single string gives us the final answer.\n    A... BBB... LLL... N... OOOO... T... W...\n\nThe resulting string is ABBBLNLLLOOOOTW.\n\n<<<ABBBLNLLLOOOOTW>>>"
