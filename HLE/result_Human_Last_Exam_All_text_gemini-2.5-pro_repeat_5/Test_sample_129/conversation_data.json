    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\nThe set of allowed symbols is {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\nThe length of the expression must be exactly 5.\nOperator precedence is `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\nLet's break down the problem by analyzing all possible valid syntactic structures for an expression of length 5. We can classify these structures based on their top-level operation or grouping. An expression `E` must be of one of these forms: `(A)`, `!A`, or `A op B`.\n\nLet L(E) be the length of expression E. We need L(E) = 5.\n\n**Case 1: `E = (A)` (Parenthesized Expression)**\nIf L(E) = 5, then L(A) must be 3. Let's find all valid expressions `A` of length 3.\n*   **Structure 1.1: `A = V op V`** (e.g., `T&F`). `L(V)+L(op)+L(V) = 1+1+1=3`.\n    *   This gives `E = (V op V)`. We need to count how many of these are true.\n    *   `op` is `&`: `(T&T)` is true. (1 expression)\n    *   `op` is `|`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are true. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n*   **Structure 1.2: `A = !B`**. `L(A)=1+L(B)=3`, so `L(B)=2`.\n    *   The only valid expression `B` of length 2 is `!V` (e.g., `!T`).\n    *   So, `A = !(!V)`. This gives `E = (!(!V))`.\n    *   `(!(!T))` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `(!(!F))` evaluates to `F`.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1.\n\n**Case 2: `E = !A` (Negation)**\nIf L(E) = 5, then L(A) must be 4. Let's find all valid expressions `A` of length 4.\n*   **Structure 2.1: `A = (B)`**. `L(A)=2+L(B)=4`, so `L(B)=2`.\n    *   `B` must be `!V`. So `A = (!V)`.\n    *   This gives `E = !((!V))`.\n    *   `!((!T))` evaluates to `!(F)`, which is `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!((!F))` evaluates to `!(T)`, which is `F`.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1.\n\n*   **Structure 2.2: `A = B op C`**. `L(B)+L(op)+L(C)=4`, so `L(B)+L(C)=3`. This means `(L(B), L(C))` is `(1,2)` or `(2,1)`.\n    *   **Sub-structure `A = V op (!V)`**: This gives `E = !(V op !V)`.\n        *   `op` is `&`: `!(V & !V)` is true for 3 combinations: `!(T&!T)`, `!(F&!T)`, `!(F&!F)`.\n        *   `op` is `|`: `!(V | !V)` is true for 1 combination: `!(F|!T)`.\n        *   Total: 3 + 1 = 4.\n    *   **Sub-structure `A = (!V) op V`**: This gives `E = !(!V op V)`.\n        *   `op` is `&`: `!(!V & V)` is true for 3 combinations: `!(!T&T)`, `!(!T&F)`, `!(!F&F)`.\n        *   `op` is `|`: `!(!V | V)` is true for 1 combination: `!(!T|F)`.\n        *   Total: 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n*   **Structure 2.3: `A = !B`**. `L(A)=1+L(B)=4`, so `L(B)=3`.\n    *   This gives `E = !(!B)`. This expression is true if `B` is true. We need to count the number of true expressions `B` of length 3.\n    *   From Case 1, we know there are 4 true expressions of the form `V op V` (`T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`). These give 4 true expressions for `E` (e.g., `!(!(T&T))`).\n    *   From Case 1, we know there is 1 true expression of the form `!(!V)` (`!(!T)`). This gives 1 true expression for `E` (`!(!(!(!T)))`).\n    *   Total for this structure: 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n**Case 3: `E = A op B` (Binary Operation)**\nIf L(E) = 5, then `L(A)+L(op)+L(B)=5`, so `L(A)+L(B)=4`. Here, `op` is the operator with the lowest precedence in the unparenthesized expression.\n*   **Structure 3.1: `V op V op V`**. This covers `L(A)+L(B)=4` where A and B are simple expressions. The structure is `V1 B1 V2 B2 V3`.\n    *   `V1&V2&V3` (parses as `(V1&V2)&V3`): True only for `T&T&T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `V1|V2|V3` (parses as `(V1|V2)|V3`): True for all except `F|F|F`. `2^3 - 1 = 7` expressions.\n    *   `V1&V2|V3` (parses as `(V1&V2)|V3`): True if `V3=T` (4 combinations) or if `V3=F, V1=T, V2=T` (1 combination). Total 5 expressions.\n    *   `V1|V2&V3` (parses as `V1|(V2&V3)`): True if `V1=T` (4 combinations) or if `V1=F, V2=T, V3=T` (1 combination). Total 5 expressions.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18.\n\n*   **Structure 3.2: `(!V) op (!V)`**. `L(A)=2, L(B)=2`.\n    *   `op` is `&`: `(!V1) & (!V2)` is true only for `!F & !F`. (1 expression)\n    *   `op` is `|`: `(!V1) | (!V2)` is true for all except `!T | !T`. `4 - 1 = 3` expressions.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n*   **Structure 3.3: `A op B` involving `!(!V)`**.\n    *   `V op (!(!V))` (`L=1, L=3`): Equivalent to `V op V`.\n        *   `&`: 1 true expression (`T & (!(!T))`).\n        *   `|`: 3 true expressions (`T|(!(!T))`, `T|(!(!F))`, `F|(!(!T))`).\n        *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\n    *   `(!(!V)) op V` (`L=3, L=1`): Symmetric to the above.\n        *   `&`: 1 true expression (`(!(!T)) & T`).\n        *   `|`: 3 true expressions (`(!(!T))|T`, `(!(!T))|F`, `(!(!F))|T`).\n        *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n**Summary of Counts**\n\nLet's sum the counts from all the unique, non-overlapping structures identified:\n1.  `(V op V)`: 4\n2.  `(!(!V))`: 1\n3.  `!((!V))`: 1\n4.  `!(V op !V)`: 4\n5.  `!(!V op V)`: 4\n6.  `!(!B)` where L(B)=3: 5\n7.  `V op V op V`: 18\n8.  `(!V) op (!V)`: 4\n9.  `V op (!(!V))`: 4\n10. `(!(!V)) op V`: 4\n\nTotal Count = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 49.\n\nFinal check of the calculation: 4+1=5, 5+1=6, 6+4=10, 10+4=14, 14+5=19, 19+18=37, 37+4=41, 41+4=45, 45+4=49. The sum is correct."
