The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal molar Ni/Ce ratio is in the range of 0.3 to 0.7, balancing active site availability with catalyst stability. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS) cycles, where Ni acts as a promoter for Ceria's redox properties, a much lower molar Ni/Ce ratio of approximately 0.05 is ideal.
