    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify All Major Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad\n\nFirst, we must compile a list of all significant, identifiable mountains that Homer mentions in the epic poem.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** The most famous mountain, home of the Greek gods. It is mentioned frequently throughout the Iliad.\n2.  **Mount Ida:** This mountain is a crucial location in the story. Zeus sits on its peak to watch the Trojan War, and Hera visits him there. It is important to note this is the Mount Ida near Troy (in modern-day Turkey), not the Mount Ida on Crete.\n3.  **Mount Athos:** This mountain is mentioned in Book 14 when Hera, in the form of Sleep, travels from Olympus towards Lemnos, stepping first \"on the peak of wooded Athos.\"\n4.  **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the island of \"Samos\" (widely identified by scholars as Samothrace) to watch the battle. The highest peak on this island is Mount Fengari.\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned as the source of the great ash-wood spear that was given to Achilles's father, Peleus, and which only Achilles could wield.\n6.  **Mount Tmolus:** Located in Lydia (modern-day Turkey), this mountain is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as the land \"under snowy Tmolus\" where the Maeonian captains Mesthles and Antiphus were born.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Modern Identity and Elevation of Each Mountain\n\nNext, we identify the modern names for these historical mountains and find their official elevations.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** Located in northern Greece. Its highest peak, Mytikas, is **2,918 meters (9,573 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Known today as **Bozdağ** in Turkey. Its elevation is **2,159 meters (7,083 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located on the Athos peninsula in northeastern Greece. Its elevation is **2,033 meters (6,670 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Ida (of Troy):** Known today as **Kaz Dağı** in Turkey. Its elevation is **1,774 meters (5,820 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in the Thessaly region of Greece. Its highest peak is **1,624 meters (5,328 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** The highest peak of the island is **Mount Fengari**. Its elevation is **1,611 meters (5,285 ft)**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Elevations to Find the Answer\n\nNow, we rank these mountains by height to find the tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  Mount Olympus: 2,918 m\n2.  **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ): 2,159 m**\n3.  Mount Athos: 2,033 m\n4.  Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı): 1,774 m\n5.  Mount Pelion: 1,624 m\n6.  Mount Samothrace (Fengari): 1,611 m\n\nThe question asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus. By comparing the elevations, we can clearly see that Mount Tmolus is the second-tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the ancient mountains with their modern counterparts (e.g., Trojan Ida with Kaz Dağı, Tmolus with Bozdağ). These identifications are well-established in classical scholarship.\n*   **Excluding Olympus:** The question specifically asks for the tallest mountain *after* Olympus, so Olympus itself is the benchmark and not the answer.\n*   **Scope of \"Mentioned\":** Even mountains mentioned briefly, like Tmolus in the Catalogue of Ships, must be included in the analysis. The prominence of the mention does not affect its physical height.\n*   **Using Accurate Data:** The final answer depends on modern, verified elevation data for each mountain.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
