    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of differential equation.**\n    The given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. This can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can see that the right-hand side is a product of a function of $t$ and a function of $x$. Therefore, it is a **separable differential equation**.\n\n2.  **Separate the variables.**\n    We move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n    $$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt $$\n    **Careful Point:** When dividing by $x^2$, we assume $x \\neq 0$. We can check if $x(t) = 0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The equation becomes $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, so this constant solution is not the one we are looking for. We can proceed with the separation.\n\n3.  **Integrate both sides.**\n    We integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n    The left side integral is:\n    $$ \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} $$\n    The right side integral is:\n    $$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t $$\n    Combining these results and adding a constant of integration, $C$:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n4.  **Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\n    The initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution.\n    **Careful Point:** Be careful with the signs during substitution.\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n    $$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n5.  **Write the particular solution.**\n    Now we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n6.  **Find the value of x(1).**\n    The question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution.\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    Now, we simplify the right-hand side.\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    To add the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8} $$\n    Multiply both sides by -1:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\n    Finally, we solve for $x(1)$ by taking the reciprocal of both sides.\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nFinal Answer: The value of $x(1)$ is $\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
