    "This is an analysis of the technique of reverse turns in various ballroom dances.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the dance where a 'Reverse Turn' figure cannot be 'overturned' (rotated more than the standard amount) without fundamentally breaking the established technique of that dance.\n\n2.  **Define \"Reverse Turn\" and \"Overturn\":**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing involving a turn to the left (anti-clockwise). Each dance has its own version with specific steps, timing, amount of turn, and character.\n    *   **Overturn:** To intentionally rotate more than the standard amount prescribed for a figure. This is often done for choreographic purposes or to change alignment on the dance floor.\n\n3.  **Analyze each dance option:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The Viennese Waltz consists of continuous left (Reverse) and right (Natural) turns. While there is a standard amount of turn per bar of music to progress down the line of dance, the continuous and highly rotational nature allows for slight variations in rotation. It is not a dance where \"overturning\" in the sense of a specific figure is a common concept, but adjusting rotation is part of mastering the dance. It's not strictly impossible.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz:** The standard Reverse Turn in Waltz makes 3/4 of a turn. However, it is extremely common for dancers to \"overturn\" this figure, often making a full 360-degree turn. This is a well-established and accepted variation used to create different choreographic lines and entries into other figures. It does *not* disregard the technique; it is considered an application of advanced technique.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango Reverse Turn is fundamentally different from those in the \"swing\" dances. It is characterized by a staccato (sharp, clipped) action, no rise and fall, and no sway. The footwork is precise, often involving a \"check\" and a collection of the feet rather than a smooth, passing action. The standard Tango Reverse Turn (e.g., Reverse Turn, Lady Outside) has a very specific and limited amount of turn (e.g., 1/2 turn over 4 steps). Attempting to add more rotation (overturn) would require adding continuous body turn and changing the footwork, which would destroy the staccato character and precise actions that define Tango technique. You would no longer be dancing a Tango Reverse Turn. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn it without disregarding the technique.\n\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** The Foxtrot Reverse Turn is known for its smoothness, continuity, and use of CBM (Contra Body Movement). Like the Waltz, it is very common to overturn the Reverse Turn. In fact, the \"Overturned Reverse Turn\" is a named and cataloged figure in the Foxtrot syllabus. This is a key part of advanced Foxtrot choreography and is fully within the technical rules.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** Similar to Waltz and Foxtrot, the Quickstep Reverse Turn can be and often is overturned. The speed and energy of the dance allow for these dynamic variations in rotation to set up subsequent figures (like a Tipple Chasse, for example). This is a standard part of competitive Quickstep choreography and does not violate the technique.\n\n**Conclusion of careful points:**\n\n*   In Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning the Reverse Turn is a common, accepted, and technically valid variation.\n*   In Viennese Waltz, the concept is less applicable to a single figure, but rotational control is key.\n*   In European Tango, the core technique (staccato, no sway, specific foot actions) is fundamentally at odds with the continuous rotation required to \"overturn\" the figure. Doing so would violate the defining characteristics of the dance.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nBased on the analysis, the only dance where overturning a Reverse Turn is impossible without abandoning the core technique is the European Tango.\n\n<<<C>>>"
