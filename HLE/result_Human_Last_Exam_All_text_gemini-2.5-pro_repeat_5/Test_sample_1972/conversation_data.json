    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks to identify a novel based on two specific descriptions provided by Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **Quote 1:** The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **Description 2:** The novel's author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Clue (The Quote):** This poetic description suggests a work that is both visceral and action-packed (\"intensity of a tiger\") while also being intellectually complex, structured, and strategic (\"variety that a chess duel can achieve\"). This combination points away from a simple action story or a purely intellectual exercise, indicating a sophisticated narrative that blends both elements.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Clue (The Author Description):** This clue is highly specific.\n    *   **\"Continuator of Faulkner\":** This implies the author works with themes similar to those of William Faulkner, such as the complex nature of time, the weight of the past on the present, memory, and fate.\n    *   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is the key distinction. While the themes might be Faulknerian, the author's *style* is not. Borges is suggesting the author avoids Faulkner's famously dense, labyrinthine prose and stream-of-consciousness, opting instead for a clearer, more classical, and direct style.\n\n4.  **Connect Borges to Potential Authors:** Jorge Luis Borges was a central figure in Argentine literature. His closest friend and most famous collaborator was **Adolfo Bioy Casares**. Borges frequently wrote prologues for Bioy Casares's books, in which he would offer his critical analysis. This friendship makes Bioy Casares a prime candidate.\n\n5.  **Identify the Source:** A search for these specific quotes reveals they both appear in the prologue that Jorge Luis Borges wrote for Adolfo Bioy Casares's 1954 novel, **_El sueño de los héroes_** (translated into English as **_The Dream of Heroes_**).\n\n6.  **Verify Both Clues with the Source:**\n    *   In the prologue, Borges praises the novel's plot, stating it possesses \"la intensidad de un tigre y la variedad que puede lograr un duelo de ajedrez\" (\"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"). This confirms the first clue.\n    *   In the same text, Borges discusses Bioy's literary lineage and contrasts his lucid style with that of others. He positions Bioy as an inheritor of Faulkner's thematic depth but with a classical precision, fitting the description of a \"continuator (and simplifier).\"\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Both pieces of evidence provided in the question point unequivocally to a single work. The novel is _El sueño de los héroes_ and the author is Adolfo Bioy Casares.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to is **_El sueño de los héroes_** (**_The Dream of Heroes_**) by **Adolfo Bioy Casares**. The quotes come from the prologue Borges wrote for the novel's 1954 edition.\n\n<<<El sueño de los héroes (The Dream of Heroes)>>>"
