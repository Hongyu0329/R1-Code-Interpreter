    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe question mentions the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky and a quote describing a man as \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This strongly suggests the man is the subject of one of Voznesensky's famous works, likely a poem or the libretto for a performance. The description \"sailor\" points to an explorer or navigator.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nVoznesensky is quoted wondering, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This indicates that at the time the poem was written, the man's final resting place was unknown, lost, or unmarked. This is a very specific and crucial detail.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the first two clues.**\nSearching for Voznesensky's work that features a sailor whose grave was lost leads directly to his famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). The protagonist of this work is Nikolai Rezanov, a real historical figure. The opera romanticizes his sea voyage to California and his tragic love story.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the details against the historical figure, Nikolai Rezanov.**\n*   **Was he a \"sailor\"?** Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807) was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. He led a major round-the-world expedition, commanding the ships *Juno* and *Avos*. So, the poetic description \"sailor\" is fitting.\n*   **Was his grave lost?** Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on his journey back to St. Petersburg in 1807. He was buried at the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. In the 1930s, under Soviet rule, the cathedral was destroyed, and the cemetery was paved over. Consequently, the exact location of his grave was lost for decades, which is precisely what Voznesensky's poem laments.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the third clue.**\nThe question states that the answer regarding his grave \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" Following the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos,\" there was a public movement to find and honor Rezanov's resting place. During the period of Perestroika in the late 1980s, archaeologists and historians in Krasnoyarsk worked to locate the grave. A new memorial was finally erected on the presumed site of his burial in the Trinity Cemetery (where some remains from the old cathedral cemetery had been transferred). This event provided a definitive \"answer\" to Voznesensky's poetic question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the clues—the connection to Voznesensky and the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" the description as a sailor, the long-lost grave, and the rediscovery/memorialization in the late 1980s—point directly to the historical figure Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
