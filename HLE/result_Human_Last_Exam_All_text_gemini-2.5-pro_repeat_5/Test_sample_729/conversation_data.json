    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    The order (size) of this group is $|Q_{4n}| = 4n$.\n\n    For this problem, the group size is 128. So, we set $4n = 128$, which gives $n = 32$.\n    The group in question is $Q_{128}$, with the presentation:\n    $G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be expressed as the set of $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$ for some integer $k$. That is, $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    It is important to note that for a non-abelian group like $Q_{128}$, the set $G^k$ is not guaranteed to be a subgroup for all integers $k$. We must compute the sets $G^k$ and then check which of them form subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Elements and Their Powers in $Q_{128}$\n\nThe elements of $G = Q_{128}$ can be uniquely written in the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n*   The set $\\{x^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ forms a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n*   The set $\\{x^i y \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ consists of the remaining 64 elements.\n\nLet's compute the $k$-th power for each type of element:\n1.  **Powers of $x^i$:** For an element in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$, the power is straightforward: $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$.\n\n2.  **Powers of $x^i y$:** We need to find a general formula for $(x^i y)^k$. Let's start with small powers:\n    *   $(x^i y)^1 = x^i y$\n    *   $(x^i y)^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i(yx^i y^{-1})y^2 = x^i(x^{-i})y^2 = y^2$. From the group presentation, we know $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   $(x^i y)^3 = (x^i y)^2(x^i y) = x^{32}x^i y = x^{32+i}y$.\n    *   $(x^i y)^4 = ((x^i y)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$. This means every element of the form $x^i y$ has order 4.\n\n    Now we can generalize for an arbitrary integer $k$:\n    *   If $k$ is even, let $k = 2m$. Then $(x^i y)^k = ((x^i y)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n    *   If $k$ is odd, let $k = 2m+1$. Then $(x^i y)^k = (x^i y)^{2m}(x^i y) = x^{32m}x^i y = x^{32m+i}y$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Power Sets $G^k$ and Check for Subgroup Property\n\nWe will now compute the set $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ and determine for which $k$ this set is a subgroup. We can analyze this by the parity of $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer**\n\n*   **Powers from $\\langle x \\rangle$:** The set of powers is $\\{(x^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\} = \\{x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. As $i$ runs from 0 to 63, $ik \\pmod{64}$ also covers all residues from 0 to 63. Therefore, this set of powers is the entire subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   **Powers from $G \\setminus \\langle x \\rangle$:** The set of powers is $\\{(x^i y)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$. Since $k$ is odd ($k=2m+1$), this becomes $\\{x^{32m+i}y \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$. As $i$ runs from 0 to 63, the exponent $32m+i$ also covers all residues from 0 to 63. So this set is $\\{x^j y \\mid 0 \\le j < 64\\}$, which is exactly the coset $G \\setminus \\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nCombining these results, for any odd $k$, $G^k = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup (G \\setminus \\langle x \\rangle) = G = Q_{128}$.\nSince $Q_{128}$ is a group, it is a valid power subgroup. This gives us our first power subgroup.\n*   **Subgroup 1:** $Q_{128}$\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is an even integer**\n\nLet $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\n*   **Powers from $\\langle x \\rangle$:** The set is $\\{(x^i)^k\\} = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in \\langle x \\rangle\\}$. In a cyclic group of order 64, this set of $k$-th powers forms the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n*   **Powers from $G \\setminus \\langle x \\rangle$:** The set is $\\{(x^i y)^k\\} = \\{x^{32m}\\}$ for all $i$. This is a set containing a single element, $x^{32m} = x^{16k}$.\n\nSo, for an even $k$, $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{16k}\\}$. For this set to be a subgroup, the single element must be contained within the subgroup part. We must check if $x^{16k} \\in \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$. This is true if and only if $\\gcd(k, 64)$ divides $16k$.\nLet $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$. By definition, $d$ divides $k$. So $k = da$ for some integer $a$. Then $16k = 16da = d(16a)$. Thus, $d$ always divides $16k$.\nThe condition is always met. Therefore, for any even integer $k$, the set of powers is a subgroup:\n$G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups\n\nWe have found all possible power subgroups. Now we need to count how many distinct subgroups there are.\n\n1.  From the odd $k$ case, we have one subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\n\n2.  From the even $k$ case, we have subgroups of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ for some even integer $k$.\n    *   Since $d$ is a GCD with 64, $d$ must be a divisor of 64. The divisors of $64 = 2^6$ are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n    *   Since $k$ is even, $k=2m$. So $d = \\gcd(2m, 64)$. This implies that $d$ must be divisible by $\\gcd(2, 64) = 2$. So, $d$ must be an even divisor of 64.\n    *   The even divisors of 64 are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n    *   For each of these even divisors $d$, we can find an even $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, 64) = d$. For instance, we can choose $k=d$. Since $d$ is even, this choice of $k$ is valid.\n    *   Therefore, the possible values for $d$ are precisely the even divisors of 64. This gives us the following distinct subgroups:\n        *   $d=2: \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n        *   $d=4: \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n        *   $d=8: \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n        *   $d=16: \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n        *   $d=32: \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2, this is the center $Z(G)$)\n        *   $d=64: \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThese 6 subgroups are all distinct since they have different orders. They are also all proper subgroups of $Q_{128}$, so they are distinct from the subgroup found in the odd $k$ case.\n\n### Final Count\n\nCombining both cases, the distinct power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ are:\n1.  $Q_{128}$\n2.  $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$\n3.  $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$\n4.  $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$\n5.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$\n6.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$\n7.  $\\{1\\}$\n\nThere is 1 subgroup from the odd $k$ case and 6 subgroups from the even $k$ case. The total number of power subgroups is $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n<<<7>>>"
