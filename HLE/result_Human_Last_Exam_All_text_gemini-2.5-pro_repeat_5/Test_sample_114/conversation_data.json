    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which word from the provided list is NOT used in a rhyming pair within Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, \"The Book of the Duchess.\" This requires checking the text of the poem for each word and its rhyming partner.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Wente:** This word, meaning \"went,\" is a common Middle English term. We need to check if it appears at the end of a line and rhymes with another word.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A word can rhyme with itself (this is called a \"rime riche\" or rich rhyme).\n    *   **Analysis:** In lines 397-398 of \"The Book of the Duchess,\" we find the couplet:\n        > And I hym folwed, and hyt forth **wente**\n        > Doun by a floury grene **wente**\n    *   Here, \"wente\" (verb, \"went\") rhymes with \"wente\" (noun, \"path\"). So, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente.\"\n\n*   **B. Here:** This is another very common word. We need to find a couplet where \"here\" is the rhyming word.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must find an instance where \"here\" is at the end of a line in a rhyming couplet.\n    *   **Analysis:** In lines 351-352, the narrator describes the park:\n        > For in that park was gret huntinge **here**,\n        > Bothe of the hert and of the dere.\n    *   Here, \"here\" clearly rhymes with \"dere\" (deer). So, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"here.\"\n\n*   **C. Fool:** This word is also quite common. Let's search for it in a rhyming position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We are looking for \"fool\" at the end of a line, not in the middle.\n    *   **Analysis:** Towards the end of the poem, in the dialogue between the narrator and the Man in Black, we find lines 1228-1229:\n        > And can no good, for I am a **fool**.\n        > And she answerde and seyde, 'Al **hool**!'\n    *   Here, \"fool\" rhymes with \"hool\" (whole, well). So, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"fool.\"\n\n*   **D. Hool:** Based on the analysis for \"Fool,\" we already have our answer for \"Hool.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** Finding one rhyme pair automatically confirms both words are used in rhymes.\n    *   **Analysis:** As shown above in lines 1228-1229, \"hool\" rhymes with \"fool.\" So, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"hool.\"\n\n*   **E. Countour:** This word means an accountant, auditor, or a kind of hunting dog. We must check if this word appears in \"The Book of the Duchess\" at all.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The question is specifically about \"The Book of the Duchess.\" The word might appear in other Chaucerian works, but that would be irrelevant.\n    *   **Analysis:** A thorough search of the text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" reveals that the word \"countour\" does not appear anywhere in the poem. While Chaucer does use the word elsewhere (for instance, in the General Prologue to *The Canterbury Tales* to describe the Franklin), it is absent from this specific work. If a word is not in the poem, it logically cannot be made to rhyme with anything within that poem.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, \"wente,\" \"here,\" \"fool,\" and \"hool\" are all used in rhyming couplets in \"The Book of the Duchess.\" The word \"countour\" does not appear in the poem at all, and therefore Chaucer does not make a rhyme with it in this work.\n\n<<<E>>>"
