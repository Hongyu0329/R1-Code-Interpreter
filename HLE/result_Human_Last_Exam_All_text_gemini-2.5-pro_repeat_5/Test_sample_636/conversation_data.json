    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\nWe are given a linear time-invariant system described by `x_dot = Ax + Bu`, where:\n*   State matrix `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe want to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` for the control law `u = -Fx`. The closed-loop system is `x_dot = (A - BF)x`. The goal is to place the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF` at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The dimensions of the matrices are important. `A` is 2x2, `B` is 2x2. The state vector `x` is 2x1, and the control input `u` is 2x1. For the multiplication `u = -Fx` to be valid, `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`.\nThe desired characteristic polynomial, `p_d(λ)`, is formed from these roots:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the identity `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the System Controllability and Simplify the Problem**\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\nThen the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1 - f1 - 2*f3, 1 - f2 - 2*f4], [1 - f1, -f2]]`\n\nCalculating the characteristic polynomial `det(λI - A_cl)` from this general form would result in a complex expression with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`) but only two equations (from matching the coefficients of `λ` and the constant term). This indicates that the solution for `F` is not unique.\n\n**Careful Point:** The non-uniqueness of the solution is a property of multi-input systems. Since the system is controllable (which can be verified by checking that the rank of the controllability matrix `[B, AB]` is 2), we know that a solution exists. We can simplify the problem by making a valid assumption about the structure of `F`.\n\nA common simplification is to use only one control input. Let's assume we only use the first input `u1` and set the second input `u2` to zero. This is equivalent to setting the second row of `F` to all zeros.\nLet `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. So, `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Closed-Loop Characteristic Polynomial with the Simplified F**\nWith our simplification, `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`, the `BF` product becomes:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] = [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]]`\nThe closed-loop matrix `A_cl` is:\n`A_cl = A - BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] - [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 - f1, 1 - f2], [1 - f1, -f2]]`\nNow, we find the characteristic polynomial of this `A_cl`, `p_cl(λ) = det(λI - A_cl)`:\n`p_cl(λ) = det([[λ - (-1 - f1), -(1 - f2)], [-(1 - f1), λ - (-f2)]])`\n`p_cl(λ) = det([[λ + 1 + f1, -1 + f2], [-1 + f1, λ + f2]])`\n`p_cl(λ) = (λ + 1 + f1)(λ + f2) - (-1 + f2)(-1 + f1)`\n`p_cl(λ) = (λ^2 + λf2 + (1 + f1)λ + (1 + f1)f2) - (1 - f1 - f2 + f1f2)`\n`p_cl(λ) = λ^2 + (1 + f1 + f2)λ + (f2 + f1f2 - 1 + f1 + f2 - f1f2)`\n`p_cl(λ) = λ^2 + (1 + f1 + f2)λ + (f1 + 2f2 - 1)`\n\n**Step 5: Equate Coefficients and Solve for the Gains**\nWe match the coefficients of our calculated polynomial `p_cl(λ)` with the desired polynomial `p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   **Matching the coefficient of λ^1:**\n    `1 + f1 + f2 = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 = 1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Matching the constant term (coefficient of λ^0):**\n    `f1 + 2f2 - 1 = 2`\n    `f1 + 2f2 = 3`  (Equation 2)\n\nNow we solve this system of two linear equations:\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2f2) - (f1 + f2) = 3 - 1`\n`f2 = 2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = 2` into Equation 1:\n`f1 + 2 = 1`\n`f1 = -1`\n\n**Step 6: Construct the Final Feedback Gain Matrix F**\nWe found `f1 = -1` and `f2 = 2`. Based on our simplification in Step 3, we have `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. Therefore, the state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[-1, 2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Final Check:**\nLet's verify the result.\n`A_cl = A - BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] - [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[-1, 2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] - [[-1, 2], [-1, 2]]`\n`A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThe roots of this equation are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = (-2 ± 2j)/2 = -1 ± j`. This matches the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<[[-1, 2], [0, 0]]>>>"
