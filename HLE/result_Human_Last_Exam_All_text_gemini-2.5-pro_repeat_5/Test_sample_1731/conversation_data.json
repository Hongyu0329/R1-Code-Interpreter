    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Conceptual Framework: Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics**\n\nThe question asks to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems from Large Deviation Theory (LDT) provide a mathematical foundation for key principles in statistical mechanics.\n\n*   **Core Idea:** In a system with many particles or degrees of freedom, the probability of observing a macroscopic state (like a specific mean energy or particle distribution) that deviates from the equilibrium state is exponentially small. The equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state.\n*   **Connection to Entropy:** The probability of a macrostate is related to the number of microstates corresponding to it, $W$. Boltzmann's formula is $S = k_B \\ln W$. Therefore, the most probable state is the one with the maximum entropy, $S$.\n*   **LDT Rate Function:** LDT formalizes this by defining a \"rate function\" $I$ that governs the probability of deviations: $P(\\text{deviation}) \\sim e^{-NI}$, where $N$ is a measure of the system size. The equilibrium state corresponds to $I=0$. This rate function is directly related to thermodynamic potentials like free energy and entropy.\n*   **Method:** To find the equilibrium state, we don't need to calculate the probabilities of deviations. We simply need to find the state that maximizes the probability, which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy subject to the physical constraints on the system.\n\n**2. The System: Photon Gas**\n\n*   **Particles:** Photons are bosons.\n*   **Statistics:** They obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n*   **Constraint 1 (Energy):** The total energy of the system, $U$, is conserved (in contact with a heat bath, it has a fixed average value). $U = \\sum_i n_i E_i$, where $n_i$ is the number of photons in the energy state $E_i$.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Particle Number):** The total number of photons is **not** conserved. This is a key feature of a photon gas (like in black-body radiation). In the language of statistical mechanics, this means the chemical potential, $\\mu$, is zero.\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy**\n\nWe will find the distribution of photons among energy levels, $\\{n_i\\}$, that maximizes the entropy for a given total energy $U$.\n\n*   **Bose-Einstein Entropy:** The statistical entropy for $n_i$ bosons distributed among $g_i$ states at energy level $E_i$ is given by:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i \\ln W_i = k_B \\sum_i \\ln \\left( \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!} \\right)$\n    Using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x \\ln x - x$) for large numbers, this simplifies to:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i \\right]$\n\n*   **Lagrange Multipliers:** We maximize $S$ subject to the energy constraint $U = \\sum_i n_i E_i$. We form the functional:\n    $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_i n_i E_i - U \\right)$\n    where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n\n*   **Finding the Equilibrium Distribution:** We set the derivative with respect to $n_i$ to zero: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_i} = 0$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial (S/k_B)}{\\partial n_i} - \\beta E_i = 0$\n    $\\ln(n_i + g_i) - \\ln n_i - \\beta E_i = 0$\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i + g_i}{n_i}\\right) = \\beta E_i$\n    $1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i} = e^{\\beta E_i}$\n    This gives the famous **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the equilibrium occupation number $\\langle n_i \\rangle$:\n    $\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{g_i}{e^{\\beta E_i} - 1}$\n    From thermodynamics, the Lagrange multiplier is identified as the inverse temperature: $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nTo find the value of $U$, we must sum (or integrate) over all possible energy states. For photons in a 3D cavity of volume $V$, the states are continuous.\n\n*   **Density of States:** The number of available states $g(E)dE$ for photons with energy between $E$ and $E+dE$ is:\n    $g(E)dE = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} E^2 dE = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} E^2 dE$ (where $\\hbar = h/2\\pi$). The factor of 2 within the $8\\pi$ accounts for the two polarization states.\n\n*   **Integral for U:** The total energy is the integral of energy per state times the number of states:\n    $U = \\int_0^\\infty E \\langle n(E) \\rangle dE = \\int_0^\\infty E \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} g(E)dE$\n    $U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{E^3}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} dE$\n\n*   **Evaluating the Integral:** Let $x = \\beta E$. The integral becomes:\n    $U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n    The definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, and its value is $\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n    $U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^4} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{15 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^4}$\n\n*   **Final Expression for U:** Substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n    $U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n    This is the celebrated Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe use the thermodynamic relation connecting entropy $S$, energy $U$, temperature $T$, and pressure $P$: $TS = U+PV$. For a photon gas, it is known that $P = U/(3V)$.\n\n*   **Relation for S:**\n    $TS = U + \\frac{U}{3V}V = \\frac{4}{3}U$\n    $S = \\frac{4U}{3T}$\n\n*   **Final Expression for S:** Substitute the expression we found for U:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} \\right)$\n    $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for mean energy (U) and entropy (S) for a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T are:\n\n**Mean Energy:**\n$U(T,V) = \\frac{\\pi^2 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n\n**Entropy:**\n$S(T,V) = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B (k_B T)^3}{45 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n\n<<<\nMean Energy: $U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3}$\nEntropy: $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n>>>"
