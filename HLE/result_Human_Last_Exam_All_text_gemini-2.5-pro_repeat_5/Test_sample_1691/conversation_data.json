    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral and Identify the Dominant Contribution**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nWe are interested in the behavior of this integral as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$. Let's denote the denominator's x-dependent part as $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$.\n\nFirst, consider the integral at $\\epsilon = 0$:\n$I(0) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{g(x)} dx = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8} dx$\n\nTo understand the behavior of this integral, we examine the integrand near the lower limit $x=0$. As $x \\to 0$, the term $9x^5$ dominates the other terms in $g(x)$.\n$g(x) = x^5(9 + 5x + 9x^3) \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\n\nThe integrand near $x=0$ behaves like $\\frac{1}{9x^5}$. The integral of this term, $\\int \\frac{1}{9x^5} dx = -\\frac{1}{36x^4}$, diverges at $x=0$. This means that the integral $I(0)$ is divergent.\n\nSince $I(0)$ diverges, for a small positive $\\epsilon$, the value of $I(\\epsilon)$ will be very large. The main contribution to the integral's value comes from the region where the denominator is smallest, which is the region near $x=0$. This is a classic singular perturbation problem.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the Integrand for Small x**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the dominant contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ comes from the region where $x$ is small. In this region, we can approximate $g(x)$ by its leading-order term:\n$g(x) \\approx 9x^5$.\n\nThus, the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ can be approximated by:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n**Step 3: Rescale the Integral and Extend the Integration Limit**\n\nThe term $\\epsilon$ becomes comparable to $9x^5$ when $x^5 \\sim \\epsilon/9$, which means $x \\sim (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}$. Since $\\epsilon$ is small, this characteristic length scale is also very small. The contribution from the rest of the integration interval (e.g., from some small $\\delta$ to 15) is finite and much smaller than the diverging part coming from the interval $[0, \\delta]$. Therefore, we can extend the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$ without affecting the leading-order asymptotic behavior. The error introduced by this extension is of a lower order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Approximate Integral using a Change of Variables**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we use a substitution that simplifies the denominator. Let the two terms in the denominator be of the same order. We choose a new variable $u$ such that:\n$9x^5 = \\epsilon u^5$\nThis gives $x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon}{9}u^5$, so $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u$.\nThe differential is $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are from $u=0$ to $u=\\infty$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + u^5)} \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Standard Definite Integral**\n\nThe remaining integral, $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du$, is a standard integral whose value is known. It can be calculated using the Beta function. The general formula is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$\n\nFor our case, $n=5$, so:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Final Analytical Formula**\n\nSubstitute the value of the definite integral back into the expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left(\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}\\right)$\n\nRearranging the terms gives the final asymptotic formula for $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThis formula captures the leading-order behavior of the integral as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$. The integral grows like $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning:\n- The singularity at $x=0$ dominates the integral's behavior for small $\\epsilon$. Correct.\n- The approximation $g(x) \\approx 9x^5$ is valid in the dominant region. Correct.\n- Extending the integration limit to $\\infty$ is a standard technique in such asymptotic analysis and is justified. Correct.\n- The scaling and evaluation of the resulting integral using the Beta function formula are correct. Correct.\nThe final formula is the leading-order term in the asymptotic expansion of $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$>>>"
