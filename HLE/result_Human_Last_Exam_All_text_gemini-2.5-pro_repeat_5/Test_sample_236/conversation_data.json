    "This problem asks for the number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_H^3$, that can be obtained by performing integral surgery on a knot with four or fewer crossings.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Identify the relevant knots and surgeries.**\n\n*   **Knots with at most four crossings:** We need to consider all knots up to crossing number 4. These are:\n    *   The unknot, $0_1$.\n    *   The right-handed trefoil knot, $+3_1$.\n    *   The left-handed trefoil knot, $-3_1$ (the mirror of $+3_1$).\n    *   The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n*   **Integral surgery producing homology spheres:** An integral surgery on a knot $K$ is a Dehn surgery with an integer coefficient, $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S_p^3(K)$. For this manifold to be an integer homology sphere (IHS), its first homology group, $H_1(S_p^3(K);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{|p|}$, must be trivial. This occurs if and only if $|p|=1$.\n*   Therefore, we need to analyze the manifolds obtained by $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the knots listed above: $0_1, +3_1, -3_1, 4_1$.\n\n**2. Analyze the surgery on the unknot ($0_1$).**\n\n*   $S_{+1}^3(0_1)$: +1 surgery on the unknot yields the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   $S_{-1}^3(0_1)$: -1 surgery on the unknot also yields $S^3$.\n*   In the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_H^3$, $S^3$ represents the identity element.\n*   This gives us **1** element: the identity.\n\n**3. Analyze the surgery on the trefoil knots ($\\pm 3_1$).**\n\nThe trefoil knot $3_1$ is the torus knot $T_{2,3}$. We consider both chiralities.\n*   **On the right-handed trefoil ($+3_1 = T_{2,3}$):**\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(+3_1)$: This is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$, also known as the Poincar√© homology sphere.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(+3_1)$: This is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n*   **On the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1 = T_{2,-3}$):**\n    *   The manifold obtained by $p$-surgery on the mirror knot $-K$ is the mirror of the manifold from $-p$-surgery on $K$. That is, $S_p^3(-K) = -S_{-p}^3(K)$.\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(-3_1) = -S_{-1}^3(+3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(-3_1) = -S_{+1}^3(+3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n\nWe have four potentially distinct manifolds: $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$, $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, and $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. To determine how many distinct homology cobordism classes they represent, we use homology cobordism invariants.\n\n*   **Casson invariant ($\\lambda$):** $\\lambda(S_{\\pm 1}^3(K)) = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_K''(1)$.\n    *   For $+3_1$, the Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta(t) = t-1+t^{-1}$, so $\\Delta''(1)=2$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S_{+1}^3(+3_1)) = -1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S_{-1}^3(+3_1)) = +1$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda(-M) = -\\lambda(M)$, we have $\\lambda(-\\Sigma(2,3,7))=-1$ and $\\lambda(-\\Sigma(2,3,5))=+1$.\n    *   As $\\lambda$ is a homomorphism and non-zero for all four, they are all non-trivial elements.\n*   **Rohlin invariant ($\\mu$):** For an IHS from $\\pm 1$ surgery on $K$, $\\mu(M) \\equiv \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$.\n    *   The trefoil knot has Arf invariant 0. So all four manifolds have $\\mu = 0$.\n*   **Heegaard Floer $d$-invariant:** For an alternating L-space knot $K$ (like the trefoil), $d(S_{\\pm 1}^3(K)) = \\frac{\\sigma(K) \\mp 2}{4}$.\n    *   The signature of $+3_1$ is $\\sigma(+3_1)=-2$.\n    *   $d(S_{+1}^3(+3_1)) = d(\\Sigma(2,3,5)) = (-2-2)/4 = -1$.\n    *   $d(S_{-1}^3(+3_1)) = d(\\Sigma(2,3,7)) = (-2+2)/4 = 0$.\n    *   Since $d(-M)=-d(M)$, we have $d(-\\Sigma(2,3,5)) = 1$ and $d(-\\Sigma(2,3,7))=0$.\n\nLet's summarize the invariants for the four classes:\n1.  $[S_{+1}^3(+3_1)]$: $(\\lambda, \\mu, d) = (-1, 0, -1)$.\n2.  $[S_{-1}^3(+3_1)]$: $(\\lambda, \\mu, d) = (+1, 0, 0)$.\n3.  $[S_{+1}^3(-3_1)]$: $(\\lambda, \\mu, d) = (-1, 0, 0)$.\n4.  $[S_{-1}^3(-3_1)]$: $(\\lambda, \\mu, d) = (+1, 0, +1)$.\n\nSince the triples of invariants are all distinct, these represent four distinct homology cobordism classes.\nThis gives us **4** distinct non-trivial elements.\n\n**4. Analyze the surgery on the figure-eight knot ($4_1$).**\n\nThe figure-eight knot is amphichiral, so we only need to consider $4_1$.\n*   $M_+ = S_{+1}^3(4_1)$ and $M_- = S_{-1}^3(4_1)$.\n*   Since $4_1$ is amphichiral ($4_1 \\cong -4_1$), we have $S_{+1}^3(4_1) \\cong S_{+1}^3(-4_1) = -S_{-1}^3(4_1)$. So $M_+ \\cong -M_-$.\n*   This means we get one element and its inverse in $\\Theta_H^3$.\n\nLet's compute their invariants:\n*   **Casson invariant ($\\lambda$):** For $4_1$, $\\Delta(t) = t^{-1}-3+t$, so $\\Delta''(1)=2$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S_{+1}^3(4_1)) = -1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S_{-1}^3(4_1)) = +1$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, these are two distinct, non-trivial classes.\n*   **Rohlin invariant ($\\mu$):** The Arf invariant of $4_1$ is 1.\n    *   $\\mu(S_{+1}^3(4_1)) = 1$.\n    *   $\\mu(S_{-1}^3(4_1)) = 1$.\n\nThe Rohlin invariant value $\\mu=1$ immediately distinguishes these two classes from all classes obtained from the unknot and trefoil knots (which all have $\\mu=0$).\nThus, surgery on the figure-eight knot gives **2** new, distinct elements.\n\n**5. Total Count.**\n\nSumming up the elements from each case:\n*   From the unknot: 1 element (the identity).\n*   From the trefoil knots: 4 distinct non-trivial elements.\n*   From the figure-eight knot: 2 distinct non-trivial elements.\n\nTotal number of elements = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7.\n\nThese 7 elements are:\n1.  The identity class, $[S^3]$.\n2.  $[S_{+1}^3(+3_1)]$, with invariants $(\\lambda, \\mu, d)=(-1,0,-1)$.\n3.  $[S_{-1}^3(+3_1)]$, with invariants $(+1,0,0)$.\n4.  $[S_{+1}^3(-3_1)]$, with invariants $(-1,0,0)$.\n5.  $[S_{-1}^3(-3_1)]$, with invariants $(+1,0,+1)$.\n6.  $[S_{+1}^3(4_1)]$, with invariants $(\\lambda, \\mu) = (-1,1)$.\n7.  $[S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$, with invariants $(\\lambda, \\mu) = (+1,1)$.\n\nAll seven are distinct.\n\n<<<7>>>"
