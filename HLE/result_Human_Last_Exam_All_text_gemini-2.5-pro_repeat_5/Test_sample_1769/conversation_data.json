    "This is a question of counterfactual historical linguistics. To determine the answer, we must trace the etymology of the word \"sister\" and then hypothetically remove the historical event that changed its trajectory.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Etymology of the Current Word \"sister\"**\n\n*   The modern English word \"sister\" descends from the Old English word *sweostor*.\n*   However, its current form is not a direct, linear evolution from *sweostor*. The word was significantly influenced by the Old Norse word *systir* during the Viking Age (roughly 8th to 11th centuries).\n*   The key influence from Old Norse *systir* is the vowel. The \"-i-\" sound (/ɪ/ as in \"sit\") in \"sister\" comes from the \"-y-\" in *systir*. The Old English *sweostor* would not have produced this sound on its own.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Native Evolutionary Path without Norse Influence**\n\n*   If the Norse had never invaded, the Old English *sweostor* would have evolved according to the natural sound changes that occurred within English itself.\n*   The Old English word *sweostor* had a variant, *swuster*. By the Middle English period, these forms had developed into competing words: *swoster* and, more commonly, *suster*. Historical records show that *suster* became the more prevalent native form, even while it was competing with the Norse-influenced *sister*.\n*   Therefore, our starting point for a hypothetical Modern English word is the Middle English form *suster*.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Later English Sound Changes to the Native Form**\n\n*   We must now trace the development of the Middle English word *suster* into Modern English.\n*   The most important sound change to consider is how the vowel 'u' would have evolved. In Middle English, the 'u' in *suster* was pronounced as a short /ʊ/ (the vowel sound in \"put\" or \"book\").\n*   This short /ʊ/ sound regularly developed into the /ʌ/ sound in Modern English (the vowel sound in \"cup\" or \"strut\"). We can see this exact change in many other words that evolved naturally from Old/Middle English:\n    *   Old English *sunu* -> Middle English *sone* -> Modern English *son* (/sʌn/)\n    *   Old English *lufu* -> Middle English *love* -> Modern English *love* (/lʌv/)\n    *   Old English *cuman* -> Middle English *comen* -> Modern English *come* (/kʌm/)\n*   Applying this same, regular sound change to Middle English *suster* (/ˈsʊstər/) would result in a Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsʌstər/.\n*   The spelling would most likely have followed the pronunciation or remained as it was, giving us the word *suster*.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English *sweostor* would have most likely evolved into the Middle English *suster*. This form, following the regular path of English phonological development, would have become the Modern English word **suster**, pronounced with the same vowel sound as \"cup\" or \"brother\".\n\n<<<suster>>>"
