    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the minimum radius of a larger circle (`R`) that can contain a specific number (`n`) of smaller, identical circles (with radius `r`).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution for `n=14` circles of radius `r=1`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the radius of the smallest possible circle that can enclose 14 smaller circles, each with a radius of 1. The term \"tightly packed\" implies that we are looking for the optimal arrangement of the 14 circles that minimizes the radius of the containing circle.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Complexity**\nFinding the optimal arrangement for circle packing is a non-trivial problem. The arrangements are often irregular and not immediately obvious. For most values of `n`, the solutions have been found through a combination of geometric analysis and computer-aided proofs or optimizations. A simple geometric derivation from scratch is generally not feasible.\n\n**Step 3: Consult Established Results**\nWe will rely on the known, published results for this problem. Mathematicians have studied this problem extensively, and the radii for optimal packings are tabulated. The result is usually expressed as the ratio `R/r`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Configuration and Radius for n=14**\nFor `n=14`, the best-known packing arrangement was found by U. Pirl in 1969. This arrangement has a C4 rotational symmetry (it looks the same after a 90-degree rotation). It consists of a central group of four circles in a tight formation, surrounded by the other ten circles.\n\nAccording to reliable mathematical sources (such as the works of Graham, Pirl, and the \"PackoMania\" online database by E. Specht), the ratio of the radius of the large circle (`R`) to the radius of the small circles (`r`) for `n=14` is:\n`R/r ≈ 3.923806...`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Radius of the Large Circle**\nThe problem states that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We can now calculate the radius `R` of the large containing circle.\n`R = (R/r) * r`\n`R ≈ 3.923806... * 1`\n`R ≈ 3.923806...`\n\n**Step 6: Round to the Required Precision**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits. Let's analyze the number `3.923806...`:\n*   The first significant digit is **3**.\n*   The second significant digit is **9**.\n*   The third significant digit is **2**.\n*   The fourth significant digit is **3**.\nThe digit immediately following the fourth significant digit is **8**. Since 8 is 5 or greater, we must round up the fourth significant digit.\nSo, `3.923...` rounded to 4 significant digits is `3.924`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Optimal Packing:** The phrase \"tightly packed\" is key; it specifies that we must use the arrangement that results in the smallest possible containing circle. Any other arrangement would lead to a larger circle.\n2.  **Source of the Solution:** The problem cannot be easily solved with high-school geometry. The solution is based on established results from the mathematical field of packing problems.\n3.  **Radius vs. Ratio:** The tabulated results are almost always given as the ratio `R/r`. It's crucial to use this ratio and multiply by the given small-circle radius (`r=1` in this case).\n4.  **Significant Figures:** Careful attention must be paid to the rounding rules for significant figures. For `3.9238...`, the first four significant digits are `3, 9, 2, 3`. The fifth digit, `8`, dictates that the fourth digit, `3`, must be rounded up to `4`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the radius of the large circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one, up to 4 significant digits, is 3.924.\n\n<<<3.924>>>"
