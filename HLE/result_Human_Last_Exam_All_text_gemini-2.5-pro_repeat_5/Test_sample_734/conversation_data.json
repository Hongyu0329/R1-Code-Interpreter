    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian who was the *first* to create a specialized vocabulary or conceptual framework to explain how the \"laws of nature\" could be altered or superseded. The framework must be able to account for two distinct types of events: a singular miracle (the virgin birth of Jesus) and a systemic, ongoing alteration of the natural world (the consequences of the Fall).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Christian Theologian:** This narrows the field to thinkers within the Christian tradition.\n    *   **First Developed:** This points to a historical priority. We are looking for an originator, not just someone who used the idea. This makes earlier figures more likely candidates than later ones (e.g., an Early Church Father over a Reformation or modern theologian).\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** This is crucial. We are not looking for a general belief in miracles, but for a specific, defined set of terms or a systematic explanation.\n    *   **Changes in the Laws of Nature:** This refers to events that defy the normal, observable, and predictable course of the physical world.\n    *   **Applicable to Both:** The system must be robust enough to explain both:\n        *   **The Virgin Birth:** A unique, singular event where God acts directly, causing a conception without normal biological means. This is a positive, creative, and specific act.\n        *   **The Fall:** A negative, universal, and ongoing change to the entire created order, introducing concepts like decay, suffering, predation, and difficult labor, which are believed by some theologians not to have existed in the same way before sin.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Theologians:**\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas developed a highly influential system distinguishing between primary causality (God's sustaining power) and secondary causality (the power of created things to act according to their natures). A miracle, for Aquinas, is when God acts outside the order of secondary causes. This is a very sophisticated system with specialized terms (e.g., acting *contra naturam* - against nature). It can certainly explain the virgin birth. It can also be applied to the Fall, suggesting a disruption in the harmonious order of secondary causes. However, he is not the *first* to systematically tackle this.\n    *   **Medieval Scholastics (e.g., Duns Scotus, William of Ockham):** These thinkers famously distinguished between God's ordained power (*potentia Dei ordinata*)—the regular laws of nature God established—and His absolute power (*potentia Dei absoluta*)—what God *could* do, which is limited only by the principle of non-contradiction. This is specialized terminology that perfectly explains miracles as an exercise of God's absolute power outside his ordained power. However, these thinkers come after Augustine and Aquinas, so they cannot be the *first*.\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):** Augustine was profoundly concerned with the relationship between God's creative act in Genesis, his ongoing providence, and the existence of miracles. To reconcile these, particularly in his commentary *De Genesi ad litteram* (The Literal Meaning of Genesis), he developed a unique and influential theory.\n\n4.  **Focus on Augustine's Contribution:**\n    *   **The Specialized Terminology:** Augustine's key concept is that of ***rationes seminales***, which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles.\"\n    *   **The Theory:** Augustine proposed that in the initial act of creation, God did not create everything in its final, developed form. Instead, He embedded these *rationes seminales* into the fabric of the created world. These are the latent potentialities for everything that would ever come to be.\n    *   **Application to Normal Events:** The ordinary course of nature (a seed growing into a tree, an animal being born) is the natural, predictable unfolding of these seminal reasons over time. This is the *ordo naturae* or \"order of nature.\"\n    *   **Application to Miracles (The Virgin Birth):** Augustine argued that a miracle is not God violating his own created order. Instead, it is God directly activating a seminal reason that would not have developed in the ordinary course of events. The potential for a virgin to conceive was a causal principle embedded in creation from the beginning, held in reserve until God chose to actualize it for the Incarnation. It was an event outside the *usual* order, but not outside the *total potential* God placed in creation.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** This framework can also account for the changes at the Fall. The Fall could be seen as a corruption that warped the way the seminal reasons unfold, introducing disorder, decay, and antagonism (e.g., thorns and thistles) into the system. Alternatively, one could argue that negative potentialities were also embedded, contingent on the free choice of humanity, and were \"activated\" by sin.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Augustine of Hippo is the correct answer. He was the first major theologian to develop a specific, named philosophical system (*rationes seminales*) to explain how God could bring about events that appear to alter the laws of nature. His system was uniquely capable of accounting for both singular, divine interventions like the virgin birth and systemic, ongoing changes to the natural world resulting from the Fall, all while maintaining that God is not acting against his original creative plan but is instead working within the full potentiality He established at the beginning.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
