    "**1. Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe system of differential equations is given by:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1 - u)$\n$u' = u^2(u - 1)$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different behaviors. Typically, stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points act as separatrices.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points occur when $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u - 1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case u=0:**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$ gives:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    So, $(d, u) = (0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case u=1:**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$ gives:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 0$.\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, $(d, u) = (0, 1)$ and $(d, u) = (-1, 1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$) are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial d'/\\partial d & \\partial d'/\\partial u \\\\ \\partial u'/\\partial d & \\partial u'/\\partial u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} = (10u - 3)d - (3u^2 - 4u^3)$\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d + 5u^2 - 3u & (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) + 5-3 & (10-3)(0) - 3+4 \\\\ 0 & 3-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2, \\lambda_2 = 1$. Both are positive, so $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (source).\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) + 5-3 & (10-3)(-1) - 3+4 \\\\ 0 & 3-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -7 - 3+4 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2, \\lambda_2 = 1$. One is positive and one is negative, so $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Find the separatrix**\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ are separatrices. Let's try to find an explicit equation for one of them. We can look for an invariant manifold, which is a curve $d=f(u)$ that is also a trajectory of the system. Let's try a polynomial form for $d(u)$.\nThe system can be written as a single ODE for $d(u)$:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3+u^4}{u^3-u^2}$.\nLet's test for a simple polynomial solution, $d(u) = au^2+bu+c$. Substituting this into the original system of differential equations:\nLHS: $d' = \\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{dd}{du} u' = (2au+b)(u^3-u^2) = 2au^4 + (b-2a)u^3 - bu^2$.\nRHS: $2(au^2+bu+c)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2+bu+c) - u^3+u^4$.\nExpanding and collecting terms by powers of $u$:\nRHS = $(2a^2+5a+1)u^4 + (4ab+5b-3a-1)u^3 + \\dots$\nComparing the coefficients of $u^4$:\n$2a = 2a^2+5a+1 \\implies 2a^2+3a+1 = 0 \\implies (2a+1)(a+1)=0$.\nThis gives two possible values for $a$: $a=-1$ or $a=-1/2$.\n\nLet's test $a=-1$. The equation for the $u^3$ coefficient is:\n$b-2a = 4ab+5b-3a-1$\n$b-2(-1) = 4(-1)b+5b-3(-1)-1$\n$b+2 = -4b+5b+3-1 = b+2$.\nThis equation is satisfied for any $b$. Now we proceed to lower order terms. Assume $d=-u^2+bu+c$.\nLHS: $d' = -2u^4+(b+2)u^3-bu^2$.\nRHS: $2(-u^2+bu+c)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2+bu+c) - u^3+u^4$\n$= -2u^4+(b+2)u^3 + (2b^2-3b+c)u^2 + c(4b-3)u + 2c^2$.\nEquating coefficients of LHS and RHS:\n$u^2: -b = 2b^2-3b+c \\implies c = -2b^2+2b$\n$u^1: 0 = c(4b-3)$\n$u^0: 0 = 2c^2$\nFrom the $u^0$ term, $2c^2=0 \\implies c=0$.\nSubstituting $c=0$ into the $u^2$ equation: $0 = -2b^2+2b = -2b(b-1)$. So, $b=0$ or $b=1$.\nThe $u^1$ equation is satisfied since $c=0$.\nThis gives two possible invariant manifolds:\n1.  $a=-1, b=0, c=0 \\implies d = -u^2$.\n2.  $a=-1, b=1, c=0 \\implies d = -u^2+u = u(1-u)$.\n\nLet's check which one is the separatrix associated with the saddle point $(-1,1)$.\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ passes through the point $(-1, 1)$, since for $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2=-1$.\nThe curve $d = u(1-u)$ passes through $(0,1)$, since for $u=1$, $d=1(1-1)=0$.\n\nThe separatrix is typically the unstable or stable manifold of a saddle point. Let's verify if $d=-u^2$ is one of these manifolds for the saddle $(-1,1)$. We can do this by checking if the tangent to the curve at the saddle point aligns with an eigenvector.\nThe eigenvectors of $J(-1,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ are:\n*   For $\\lambda_1=-2$ (stable): $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 - (-2) & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - (-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies v_u=0$. The eigenvector is $v_s=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The stable manifold is tangent to the line $u=1$.\n*   For $\\lambda_2=1$ (unstable): $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 - 1 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -3v_d - 6v_u = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is $v_u=\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow let's find the tangent to the curve $d=-u^2$ at $(-1,1)$. We can parameterize the curve by $u$, as $(d(u), u) = (-u^2, u)$. The tangent vector is $(\\frac{dd}{du}, \\frac{du}{du}) = (-2u, 1)$.\nAt the point $(-1,1)$, we have $u=1$. The tangent vector is $(-2(1), 1) = (-2, 1)$.\nThis matches the unstable eigenvector $v_u$. Therefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1,1)$. Unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe separatrix is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1,1)$. We found an exact analytic expression for this manifold."
