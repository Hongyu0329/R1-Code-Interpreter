    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are:\n    *   Helium (He)\n    *   Neon (Ne)\n    *   Argon (Ar)\n    *   Krypton (Kr)\n    *   Xenon (Xe)\n    *   Radon (Rn)\n    *   (Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is excluded).\n\n2.  **Determine the Primary Reservoir on Earth:** The vast majority of Earth's noble gases are found in the atmosphere. Therefore, their atmospheric concentration is a very good first indicator of their overall abundance.\n\n3.  **Compare the Abundances of Stable Noble Gases:** Let's look at the atmospheric concentrations of the non-radioactive (or very long-lived) noble gases.\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% or 9,340 parts per million (ppm). It is the most abundant noble gas.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 ppm.\n    *   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm. Although it's constantly produced in the Earth's crust by radioactive decay, it is light enough to escape Earth's gravity over time, which keeps its atmospheric concentration low.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm.\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n    *   Based on this, Xenon is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases.\n\n4.  **Analyze Radon (Rn):** This is the most crucial step.\n    *   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. It is continuously produced as part of the radioactive decay chain of uranium and thorium, which are present in the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Key Property:** Radon itself is highly radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only **3.8 days**.\n    *   **Consequence:** Because it decays so quickly, it cannot accumulate in the environment. At any given moment, the total amount of Radon on the entire planet is extremely small. While it is constantly being generated, it is also constantly disappearing.\n\n5.  **Compare the Rarest Stable Gas (Xenon) with Radon:**\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** As a stable element, it has accumulated in the atmosphere over geological time. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be over 2 billion metric tons.\n    *   **Radon (Rn):** Due to its short half-life, the total amount of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given time is estimated to be only about 20-30 kilograms. Even including the amount in the crust and oceans, the total instantaneous mass is exceptionally low.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The amount of Radon present on Earth at any moment is many orders of magnitude less than the amount of Xenon. Therefore, Radon is the rarest noble gas.\n\n6.  **Address the Timeframe \"in 2002\":**\n    *   The relative abundances of these elements are governed by large-scale geological and atmospheric processes that occur over millions of years. The concentrations do not change significantly on a year-to-year basis. Therefore, the answer for 2002 would be the same as it is today and was for the recent past. The year is not a deciding factor in the outcome.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy comparing the total quantities of each noble gas on Earth, it is clear that Radon's extremely short half-life prevents it from accumulating, making it by far the rarest of the naturally occurring noble gases as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
