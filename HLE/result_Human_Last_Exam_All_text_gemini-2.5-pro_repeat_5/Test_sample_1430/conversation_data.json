    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **C:** A smooth projective curve over $\\mathbb{C}$ of genus $g=3$.\n*   **X:** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted $X = C^{(15)}$. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X):** The group of algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on X.\n*   **Rank of the Neron-Severi Group $\\rho(X)$:** Also known as the Picard number, it is the rank of the finitely generated abelian group NS(X). Over the complex numbers, $\\rho(X)$ is the dimension of the subspace of $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ spanned by the cohomology classes of algebraic cycles.\n\n**2. Relate the Geometry of $X = C^{(15)}$ to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to relate the variety $X$ to the Jacobian of the curve $C$.\n\n*   **The Jacobian:** The Jacobian of C, denoted $\\text{Jac}(C)$, is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety that parametrizes degree 0 line bundles on C. The variety $\\text{Pic}^d(C)$, which parametrizes degree $d$ line bundles on C, is an algebraic variety isomorphic to $\\text{Jac}(C)$.\n\n*   **The Abel-Jacobi Map:** There is a well-defined map, called the Abel-Jacobi map (or sum map), $S: C^{(n)} \\to \\text{Pic}^n(C)$, which sends an effective divisor $D$ of degree $n$ to its corresponding line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$.\n\n*   **Fibration Structure:** For a curve of genus $g$, when the degree $n$ is sufficiently large ($n \\ge 2g-1$), this map $S: C^{(n)} \\to \\text{Pic}^n(C)$ gives $C^{(n)}$ the structure of a projective bundle over $\\text{Pic}^n(C)$.\n    *   In our case, $g=3$ and $n=15$. The condition is $15 \\ge 2(3)-1 = 5$, which is satisfied.\n    *   The base of this fibration is $B = \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$, which is isomorphic to $\\text{Jac}(C)$.\n    *   The fiber over a point $[L] \\in \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$ is the projective space of effective divisors linearly equivalent to $L$, which is $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, L))$.\n    *   By the Riemann-Roch theorem, for a line bundle $L$ of degree 15 on a genus 3 curve, the dimension of the space of global sections is $\\dim H^0(C, L) = \\deg(L) - g + 1 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\n    *   Therefore, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over $\\text{Jac}(C)$.\n\n**3. Compute the Picard Number using the Fibration Structure**\n\nFor a projective bundle $\\pi: P \\to B$, the Neron-Severi group of the total space $P$ is related to that of the base $B$. Specifically, there is a split exact sequence for the Picard groups:\n$0 \\to \\text{Pic}(B) \\xrightarrow{\\pi^*} \\text{Pic}(P) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$\nThis implies that $\\text{Pic}(P) \\cong \\text{Pic}(B) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$. Taking the ranks of these groups (which are the Picard numbers), we get a simple formula:\n$\\rho(P) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\n\nApplying this to our situation ($P = C^{(15)}$, $B = \\text{Jac}(C)$), we get:\n$\\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(\\text{Jac}(C)) + 1$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**4. Determine the Range of the Picard Number of Jac(C)**\n\nLet $A$ be an abelian variety of dimension $g$. Its Picard number $\\rho(A)$ is bounded by $1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le h^{1,1}(A)$, where $h^{1,1}(A) = \\dim H^{1,1}(A)$ is a Hodge number. For an abelian variety, $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$.\n\nIn our case, $A = \\text{Jac}(C)$ and the dimension is $g=3$. Thus, the bounds for its Picard number are:\n$1 \\le \\rho(\\text{Jac}(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\nWe need to check if these theoretical bounds are actually achieved by Jacobians of genus 3 curves.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:** For a **generic** curve $C$ of genus 3 (for example, a generic non-hyperelliptic curve), its Jacobian $\\text{Jac}(C)$ is a simple abelian variety whose only endomorphisms are multiplication by integers. In this case, the Neron-Severi group $\\text{NS}(\\text{Jac}(C))$ is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Thus, $\\text{NS}(\\text{Jac}(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and its rank is $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C)) = 1$. This is the minimum possible value.\n\n*   **Largest Rank:** The maximum value $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C)) = 9$ is achieved if the Jacobian is of \"Hodge type,\" meaning that every Hodge class in $H^2(\\text{Jac}(C), \\mathbb{Q})$ is algebraic. This occurs for special curves with extra symmetries, known as curves with Complex Multiplication (CM). For instance, the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$, is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to a product of three copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. For such a Jacobian, the Picard number is maximal: $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C)) = g^2 = 9$.\n\nSo, the possible range for the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve is indeed $[1, 9]$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we substitute the minimum and maximum values of $\\rho(\\text{Jac}(C))$ into our formula from Step 3.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank of $\\rho(X)$:**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(\\text{Jac}(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank of $\\rho(X)$:**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(\\text{Jac}(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
