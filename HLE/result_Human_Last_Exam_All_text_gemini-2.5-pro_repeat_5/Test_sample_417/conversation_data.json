    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall structure and symmetry of the molecule.**\n    The molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    *   The central core is a hexasubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   At positions 2, 4, and 6, there are methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are large substituent groups: `[((...)-indazol-2-yl)methyl]`. Let's denote the camphor-indazole part as `R'`. The groups are `-CH2-R'`.\n    *   The molecule has a C3 axis of rotational symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring. This means the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the three `-CH2-R'` arms are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, to find the total number of signals, we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in one of the methyl groups and one of the `-CH2-R'` arms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the signals from the central part of the molecule.**\n    *   **Methyl groups on the benzene ring:** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single peak in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n        *   **Signal count: 1**\n    *   **Methylene (-CH2-) linker groups:** The three `-CH2-` groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are also equivalent due to C3 symmetry. Let's consider a single `-CH2-` group. It is bonded to the achiral benzene ring on one side and a chiral `R'` group on the other. The presence of the adjacent chiral center (`R'`) makes the two protons of the `-CH2-` group diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. They will typically appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet).\n        *   **Signal count: 2**\n\n3.  **Analyze the signals from the substituent group R'.**\n    *   The group `R'` is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is a complex name for a pyrazole ring fused to a camphor-like skeleton (a substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system).\n    *   The most common and chemically plausible structure corresponding to an N-substituted pyrazole fused to a camphor skeleton is derived from the reaction of 3-formylcamphor with a substituted hydrazine.\n    *   This `R'` group is a rigid, chiral moiety. As a result, protons that are not chemically equivalent by local symmetry (which is absent here) will give distinct signals. We need to count all the unique protons in this group.\n    *   Let's count the protons based on this structure:\n        *   **Methyl protons (CH3):** The camphor skeleton has three methyl groups.\n            1.  One methyl group on a bridgehead carbon (C1 in camphor numbering). This is unique. (1 signal)\n            2.  Two methyl groups on the one-carbon bridge (C7 in camphor numbering). These two geminal methyl groups are diastereotopic because of the overall chirality of the molecule. They are non-equivalent. (2 signals)\n            *   Total signals from methyl groups: 1 + 2 = **3 signals**.\n        *   **Methine protons (CH):**\n            1.  One proton on the pyrazole ring. This is in a unique electronic environment. (1 signal)\n            2.  One proton on the camphor skeleton at the C3 position (adjacent to the fusion). (1 signal)\n            3.  One proton at the other bridgehead carbon (C4 in camphor numbering). (1 signal)\n            *   Total signals from methine groups: 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 signals**.\n        *   **Methylene protons (CH2):** The camphor skeleton has two CH2 groups.\n            1.  The CH2 group at the C5 position. The two protons (endo and exo) are diastereotopic. (2 signals)\n            2.  The CH2 group at the C6 position. These two protons are also diastereotopic. (2 signals)\n            *   The C5 and C6 positions are themselves non-equivalent, so all four methylene protons are unique.\n            *   Total signals from methylene groups: 2 + 2 = **4 signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the R' group = 3 (from CH3) + 3 (from CH) + 4 (from CH2) = **10 signals**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of expected peaks.**\n    *   We sum the signals from all the non-equivalent parts of the molecule (one arm and one central methyl group).\n    *   Total signals = (signals from benzene-CH3) + (signals from linker-CH2) + (signals from R' group)\n    *   Total signals = 1 + 2 + 10 = 13.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The C3 symmetry is crucial for simplifying the problem.\n*   Recognizing that the methylene linker protons (-CH2-) are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center is a key step. This adds 2 signals, not 1.\n*   The chiral and rigid nature of the camphor-derived group (R') means that most protons are in unique environments. Protons on geminal methyl groups (on the bridge) and on each CH2 group (exo/endo) are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent.\n*   The assumed chemical structure of the R' group is based on standard synthetic routes for such ligands. The complex IUPAC name corresponds to this type of fused bicyclic structure. Different potential structures (e.g., a pyridazine) are less likely based on the \"indazole\" name.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n*   Benzene methyls: 1 signal\n*   Linker methylenes: 2 signals\n*   Camphor-indazole group: 10 signals\n*   Total = 1 + 2 + 10 = 13\n\nFinal Answer is 13.\n\n<<<I>>>"
