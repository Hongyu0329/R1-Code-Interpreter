    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific philosopher who belongs to a particular philosophical school (Lviv-Warsaw School) and is known for a specific conceptual breakdown (decomposing \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\").\n\n2.  **Identify Key Terms:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** A highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1918-1939). Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The answer must be one of these or a closely related philosopher.\n    *   **Hallmark:** This is the general term for a sign or an indicator. In the original Polish, the likely term is *znak*. A hallmark is something that points to something else.\n    *   **Symptoms:** This term implies a natural, causal relationship between the sign and what it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire. In Polish, the term is *oznaka*.\n    *   **Signals:** This term implies a conventional, arbitrary, or rule-based relationship between the sign and what it signifies. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop. In Polish, the term is *sygnał*.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction:** The core of the question is about the semiotic distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals). This is a fundamental concept in the philosophy of language and the theory of signs. The task is to attribute this specific terminology to a member of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential Philosophers from the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   While many members of the school worked on logic and language, the philosopher most famous for his detailed work in semiotics, theory of meaning, and philosophy of language is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   His work often involved creating precise classifications and definitions to clarify philosophical problems, especially those related to language.\n\n5.  **Verify the Attribution:** Research into the works of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz confirms that he made exactly this distinction. In his logical and semiotic analyses, he used the Polish term *znak* (sign/hallmark) as the overarching category. He then differentiated between:\n    *   ***Oznaki*** **(symptoms or natural signs):** Signs that are linked to what they signify by a natural or causal law.\n    *   ***Sygnały*** **(signals or conventional signs):** Signs whose meaning is established by a convention or a rule of use, such as words in a language.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Translation:** The English term \"hallmark\" is a plausible translation for the general Polish concept of *znak* (sign/mark), but \"sign\" is more common. The key is understanding the underlying tripartite structure: a general category (*znak*) divided into two sub-categories (*oznaka* and *sygnał*).\n*   **Specificity:** While the distinction between natural and conventional signs is ancient (dating back to the Stoics), the question asks specifically about the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who used this particular terminology (\"symptoms\" and \"signals\"). This points directly to Ajdukiewicz's specific formulation.\n*   **Context:** Ajdukiewicz developed this distinction as part of his broader program of logical analysis of language, aiming to create a clear framework for understanding meaning and communication, which was a central goal of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made this distinction is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. He systematically analyzed the concept of a sign (*znak*) and decomposed it into natural signs or symptoms (*oznaki*) and conventional signs or signals (*sygnały*).\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
