    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Edge Squares and Their Properties**\n*   An 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total.\n*   The \"edge squares\" are those on the first rank, last rank, first file, and last file.\n*   Let's count them: There are 8 squares on the top rank (rank 8), 8 on the bottom rank (rank 1), 8 on the left file (file 'a'), and 8 on the right file (file 'h').\n*   The 4 corner squares (a1, h1, a8, h8) are part of both a rank and a file. To avoid double-counting, the total number of edge squares is (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28 squares.\n*   A key property of a chessboard is that half its squares are light-colored (white) and half are dark-colored (black). The 28 edge squares are also evenly divided by color: 14 are white, and 14 are black.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rules of Bishop Placement**\n*   The goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 edge squares.\n*   The constraint is that no two bishops can attack each other.\n*   Bishops move and attack along diagonals. Therefore, no two bishops can be placed on the same diagonal line.\n*   Crucially, a bishop on a white square can only attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack pieces on black squares. This means we can solve the problem for the white edge squares and the black edge squares independently and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 3: Maximize Bishops on the 14 White Edge Squares**\n*   We need to place as many bishops as possible on the 14 white edge squares without any of them sharing a diagonal.\n*   Let's list the 14 white edge squares: b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, h3, h5, h7, a8, c8, e8, g8.\n*   By analyzing the diagonals these squares occupy, we find that they form distinct groups where squares within a group attack each other.\n    *   One group forms a cycle of four mutually attacking squares: b1 attacks h7, which attacks g8, which attacks a2, which attacks b1. From this group of 4 squares {b1, h7, g8, a2}, we can place a maximum of 2 non-attacking bishops (e.g., on b1 and g8).\n    *   A second group forms another cycle of four: {d1, h5, e8, a4}. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops from this group.\n    *   A third group forms yet another cycle of four: {f1, h3, c8, a6}. We can also place a maximum of 2 bishops from this group.\n    *   The final two white edge squares, h1 and a8, attack each other. From this pair {h1, a8}, we can place a maximum of 1 bishop.\n*   Summing these up, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the white edge squares is 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on the 14 Black Edge Squares**\n*   The process is identical for the 14 black edge squares: a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, h2, h4, h6, b8, d8, f8, h8.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the board, the attack patterns are analogous to the white squares.\n    *   One cycle of four attacking squares: {c1, h6, f8, a3}. Max 2 bishops.\n    *   A second cycle of four: {e1, h4, d8, a5}. Max 2 bishops.\n    *   A third cycle of four: {g1, h2, b8, a7}. Max 2 bishops.\n    *   A final attacking pair: {a1, h8}. Max 1 bishop.\n*   The maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the black edge squares is also 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops and the Final Answer**\n*   Since bishops on white squares do not attack bishops on black squares, we can simply add the maximums for each color.\n*   Total maximum bishops placed = (Max on white squares) + (Max on black squares) = 7 + 7 = 14.\n*   The problem asks how many edge squares would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Number of placed bishops = 14.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Placed bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nTherefore, if the players succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 edge squares would remain empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
