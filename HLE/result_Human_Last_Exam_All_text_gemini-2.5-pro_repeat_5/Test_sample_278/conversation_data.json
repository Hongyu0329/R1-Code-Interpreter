    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nfor $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe value of the parameter $b$ is piecewise:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b = 1$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b = 5$.\n\nLet's analyze the shape of the curve in these two intervals.\n\n*   **For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$:**\n    The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    We know that $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which means $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n    As $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n    *   $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n    *   $y = \\sin t$ is always non-negative ($y \\ge 0$). It goes from $\\sin(0)=0$ to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$.\n    This part of the curve is the **upper semi-circle** of the unit circle.\n\n*   **For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$:**\n    The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n    We can write $\\frac{y}{5} = \\sin t$. Using the identity $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, we get $x^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = 1$, or $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n    As $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n    *   $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n    *   $y = 5\\sin t$ is always non-positive ($y \\le 0$). It goes from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\n    This part of the curve is the **lower semi-ellipse**.\n\nThe complete figure is a closed curve formed by joining the upper unit semi-circle and the lower semi-ellipse with semi-axes 1 and 5.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the bounding box of the figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum coordinates the figure reaches. This defines a bounding rectangle.\n\n*   **Horizontal Extent (x-values):**\n    The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$. Over the full interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the cosine function ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n    The width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Vertical Extent (y-values):**\n    The y-coordinate depends on the interval.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value is $y_{max_1} = \\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$. The minimum value is $0$.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin t$. The minimum value is $y_{min_2} = 5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$. The maximum value is $0$.\n    Combining the ranges for both parts, the overall maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$ and the overall minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    The height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest circumscribing square**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that \"outcircles\" (circumscribes) this figure must be large enough to contain this bounding rectangle.\n\nThe side length, $s$, of the smallest circumscribing square (assuming it is axis-aligned, which is standard) must be equal to the larger dimension of the bounding rectangle.\n*   $s = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square**\n\nThe area of a square with side length $s$ is given by the formula $Area = s^2$.\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\nFor an elongated shape like this one (height is 3 times the width), the smallest circumscribing square is indeed the one aligned with the principal axes of the shape. Any rotation would require a larger square to contain the figure."
