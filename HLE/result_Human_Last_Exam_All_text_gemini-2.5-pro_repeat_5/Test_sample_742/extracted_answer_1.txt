No. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (which involves Hilbert spaces, operators, and probability theory to model physical systems) is fundamentally incommensurable with the framework of Gödel's ontological proof (which uses S5 modal logic to reason about abstract concepts like "positive properties" and "necessary existence"). The core axioms and concepts of Gödel's proof cannot be derived from or represented within the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics. The two systems address entirely different domains of inquiry—physics versus metaphysics—making it impossible to use one to prove propositions within the other.
