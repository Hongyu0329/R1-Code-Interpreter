    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs that together cover all edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\n*   **Complete Graph \\(K_n\\):** A graph with $n$ vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Here, $n=35$. The total number of edges in $K_{35}$ is $\\binom{35}{2} = \\frac{35 \\times 34}{2} = 595$.\n*   **Family of Bipartite Graphs:** We have a set of bipartite graphs, say $\\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\}$. Each graph $G_i$ has a vertex set $V_i$ which is a subset of the 35 vertices of $K_{35}$.\n*   **Covering all Edges:** The union of the edge sets of all graphs $G_i$ must be equal to the edge set of $K_{35}$. This means for any pair of distinct vertices $\\{u, v\\}$ from $K_{35}$, there must be at least one graph $G_i$ in the family such that $\\{u, v\\}$ is an edge in $G_i$.\n*   **Minimizing the Number of Vertices:** The quantity to be minimized is the sum of the sizes of the vertex sets of the graphs in the family, which is $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i|$.\n\n**2. Formulating the Problem Mathematically**\n\nLet $V$ be the set of 35 vertices of $K_{35}$. A bipartite graph $G_i$ with vertex set $V_i \\subseteq V$ has a bipartition $(A_i, B_i)$, where $A_i$ and $B_i$ are disjoint sets and their union is $V_i$. The edges of $G_i$ connect vertices from $A_i$ to vertices in $B_i$.\n\nTo cover all edges of $K_{35}$, we can assume each $G_i$ is a *complete* bipartite graph with parts $A_i$ and $B_i$. If it's not complete, we can add the missing edges between $A_i$ and $B_i$ without changing the vertex set $V_i$, and this only helps in covering more edges.\n\nSo, the condition is: For any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in V$, there must exist at least one index $i$ such that either ($u \\in A_i$ and $v \\in B_i$) or ($v \\in A_i$ and $u \\in B_i$). We want to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^k (|A_i| + |B_i|)$.\n\n**3. Identifying the Equivalent Known Problem**\n\nThis problem is a classic one in extremal combinatorics. It is known as the **optimal testing system problem** or the **bipartite covering problem**. The solution was given by G. Hansel in 1964.\n\n**4. The Solution using the Recursive Formula**\n\nLet $f(n)$ be the minimum required sum of vertices for $K_n$. The value of $f(n)$ is given by the following recursive formula:\n$f(n) = m(n-t) + f(t)$\nwhere:\n*   $m = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ (the smallest integer such that $2^m \\ge n$)\n*   $t = 2^m - n$\n*   The base cases are $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 0$.\n\n**5. Calculation for n = 35**\n\nWe will apply the formula iteratively to find $f(35)$.\n\n*   **Part 1: Calculate f(35)**\n    *   $n = 35$\n    *   $m = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$. Since $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$, we have $m = 6$.\n    *   $t = 2^m - n = 2^6 - 35 = 64 - 35 = 29$.\n    *   Using the formula:\n        $f(35) = 6 \\cdot (35 - 29) + f(29) = 6 \\cdot 6 + f(29) = 36 + f(29)$.\n\n*   **Part 2: Calculate f(29)**\n    *   Now we need to find $f(n)$ for $n = 29$.\n    *   $m = \\lceil \\log_2 29 \\rceil$. Since $2^4 = 16$ and $2^5 = 32$, we have $m = 5$.\n    *   $t = 2^m - n = 2^5 - 29 = 32 - 29 = 3$.\n    *   Using the formula:\n        $f(29) = 5 \\cdot (29 - 3) + f(3) = 5 \\cdot 26 + f(3) = 130 + f(3)$.\n\n*   **Part 3: Calculate f(3)**\n    *   Now we need to find $f(n)$ for $n = 3$.\n    *   $m = \\lceil \\log_2 3 \\rceil$. Since $2^1 = 2$ and $2^2 = 4$, we have $m = 2$.\n    *   $t = 2^m - n = 2^2 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n    *   Using the formula:\n        $f(3) = 2 \\cdot (3 - 1) + f(1) = 2 \\cdot 2 + f(1) = 4 + f(1)$.\n\n*   **Part 4: Use the Base Case**\n    *   For $n=1$, there are no pairs of vertices to separate, so the cost is 0. Thus, $f(1) = 0$.\n\n*   **Part 5: Substitute Back to Find the Final Answer**\n    *   $f(3) = 4 + f(1) = 4 + 0 = 4$.\n    *   $f(29) = 130 + f(3) = 130 + 4 = 134$.\n    *   $f(35) = 36 + f(29) = 36 + 134 = 170$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 170.\n\n### Careful Points and Summary\n\n*   The problem is about covering, not partitioning, the edges.\n*   The cost function is the sum of the sizes of vertex sets, $\\sum |V_i|$.\n*   The problem has a known optimal solution given by a recursive formula. A simple construction using binary labels for all vertices gives an upper bound of $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = 35 \\times 6 = 210$. The recursive formula provides the exact minimum, which is better than this simple bound.\n*   The recursive calculation must be carried out carefully until a base case ($f(1)$ or $f(0)$) is reached.\n\nThe final result is obtained by tracing the recursion: $f(35) \\rightarrow f(29) \\rightarrow f(3) \\rightarrow f(1)$.\n\nFinal Answer: The minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 170.\n\n<<<170>>>"
