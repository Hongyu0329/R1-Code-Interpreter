The edges of the image will simplify. Any curved edges will straighten out, and any corners will be smoothed away. The process, known as curve-shortening flow, causes any closed boundaries (i.e., finite shapes) to shrink and eventually disappear. The final, steady-state image will consist of large black and white regions separated only by perfectly straight lines.
