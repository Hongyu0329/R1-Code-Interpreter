    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures and Concepts:** The question involves historian Fernand Braudel, writer Paul Morand, and a \"conceptual entity.\" The core of the question is a quote from Morand, used by Braudel to support a historical perspective.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Quote's Description:**\n    *   **Source:** The idea is attributed to Paul Morand but highlighted by Fernand Braudel, who is known for his emphasis on large-scale, long-term history (*longue durée*) and world-systems.\n    *   **The Entity:** It is described as a \"conceptual entity.\" This means it's an abstract idea or a framework for understanding history, not a physical object.\n    *   **The Example:** The \"symbol of a nation\" is given as an *example* of this entity, not the entity itself. This is a crucial distinction. It implies the entity is a broader category that can sometimes manifest as a nation.\n    *   **The Metaphor:** The entity \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\" A sphere represents totality, the globe, and interconnectedness. This suggests the entity cannot be understood in isolation but must be placed in a global context.\n\n3.  **Locate the Original Source:** The quote is found in Fernand Braudel's essay \"History and the Social Sciences: The *Longue Durée*,\" which is collected in his book *On History*. Braudel uses Morand's words to help define one of his own key concepts.\n\n4.  **Examine the Full Quote in Context:** To identify the \"conceptual entity,\" we need to look at the full sentence as quoted by Braudel. The passage from Paul Morand, as cited by Braudel, is:\n    > \"A **civilization**... is a continuity which, when it is inscribed in a space, even a vast one, takes on the symbol of a nation... But this continuity should be inscribed within a sphere on which all the lines of force of the globe can be read.\"\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The quote explicitly names the conceptual entity at the very beginning: **\"A civilization\"**.\n    *   It then explains how a civilization, when viewed in a geographically limited way (\"inscribed in a space\"), can appear as a nation. This perfectly matches the clue that the entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\"\n    *   Finally, it makes the main point that this entity (civilization) must be understood in a global context (the \"sphere\"). This aligns perfectly with Braudel's entire historical methodology, which sought to understand broad civilizations over the *longue durée* rather than focusing narrowly on the political histories of individual nations.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe step-by-step analysis reveals that the conceptual entity Paul Morand was describing, and which Fernand Braudel quoted to support his own work, is **civilization**.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
