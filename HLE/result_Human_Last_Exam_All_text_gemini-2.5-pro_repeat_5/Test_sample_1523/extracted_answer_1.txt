The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ is a functional of the field configuration $\phi(\tau, \vec{x})$. It is equivalent to twice the Euclidean action, $2S_E[\phi]$. Explicitly, it is given by the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density (multiplied by 2) over the finite-temperature spacetime manifold: $(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \left[ (\partial_\tau \phi)^2 + (\vec{\nabla}\phi)^2 + m^2\phi^2 \right]$.
