    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be synthesized *efficiently*. The word \"efficiently\" is key, as it implies a reasonable reaction rate and yield, not just any condition under which trace amounts of the product might form.\n\n2.  **Identify the Synthesis Method:** The most common and direct method for producing xenon fluorides is the direct reaction between xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F2). The general reaction is:\n    Xe(g) + nF2(g) → XeFn(s)\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction Conditions:** The specific product formed (XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6) is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, namely:\n    *   The molar ratio of Xenon to Fluorine.\n    *   The temperature.\n    *   The pressure.\n\n4.  **Recall Specific Conditions for XeF4:**\n    *   The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) requires a specific set of conditions to favor its formation over the other xenon fluorides.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: **Xe (g) + 2 F2 (g) → XeF4 (s)**\n    *   To produce XeF4, a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a molar ratio of approximately **1:5** (an excess of fluorine compared to the stoichiometric 1:2 ratio) is used.\n    *   This mixture is typically heated in a sealed nickel or Monel (a nickel alloy) vessel. Nickel is used because it forms a passive, non-reactive layer of nickel fluoride on its surface, protecting it from further attack by the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n    *   The standard temperature cited in chemical literature for this reaction to proceed efficiently is **400 °C**. The pressure is usually maintained at around 6 atmospheres.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Role of Temperature (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Activation Energy:** The reaction between xenon and fluorine has a high activation energy. This means that significant thermal energy is required to initiate the reaction and make it proceed at a practical rate. Temperatures much lower than 400 °C (like 200 °C, 78 °C, or below) would result in a reaction rate that is too slow to be considered \"efficient.\"\n    *   **Thermodynamics vs. Kinetics:** While the formation of xenon fluorides is exothermic (releases heat), meaning lower temperatures thermodynamically favor the products, the kinetic barrier (activation energy) prevents the reaction from occurring at low temperatures. A balance must be struck.\n    *   **Product Selectivity:** Temperature also influences which fluoride is formed.\n        *   At **400 °C** with a 1:5 ratio of Xe:F2, XeF4 is the major product.\n        *   If the temperature is increased significantly (e.g., to **600 °C**), or if a larger excess of fluorine is used, the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) is favored.\n        *   Therefore, 400 °C represents an optimal temperature that provides enough energy for an efficient reaction rate while still selectively producing XeF4.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is too high and would favor the production of XeF6 over XeF4.\n    *   **B. 400 C:** This is the well-established, standard temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF4. It provides the necessary activation energy without over-fluorinating the xenon to XeF6.\n    *   **C. 200 C:** The reaction rate would be impractically slow at this temperature. Not efficient.\n    *   **D. 78 C:** Close to room temperature. The reaction rate would be negligible.\n    *   **E. 0 C:** The reaction rate would be negligible.\n    *   **F. -78 C:** The reaction would not proceed at this temperature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the established chemical synthesis protocols, 400 °C is the standard and optimal temperature for producing XeF4 efficiently. It is the lowest temperature among the choices that overcomes the reaction's activation energy to provide a practical rate of formation while maintaining selectivity for XeF4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
