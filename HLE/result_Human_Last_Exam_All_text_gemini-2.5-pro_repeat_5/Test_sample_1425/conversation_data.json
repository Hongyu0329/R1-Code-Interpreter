    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Grand Canonical Partition Function**\nThe partition function `Z` for a quantum system in the grand canonical ensemble is defined as the trace over the entire Fock space of the density operator `e^(-β(H - μN))`.\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right)$\nwhere:\n*   `H` is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   `N` is the particle number operator.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential.\n*   `β = 1/(k_B T)` where `T` is the temperature and `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `Tr(...)` denotes the trace over a complete set of states in the Fock space.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the Given Hamiltonian**\nThe problem specifies a particular Hamiltonian: `H = -μN`. We substitute this into the general formula for `Z`. The operator in the exponent, sometimes called the grand canonical Hamiltonian `K`, becomes:\n`K = H - μN = (-μN) - μN = -2μN`\nSo, the partition function for this specific system is:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β(-2μN))) = Tr(e^(2βμN))`\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Path Integral Formulation**\nThe trace `Tr(e^(-βK))` can be evaluated using the path integral formalism. The partition function is expressed as a functional integral over fields `ψ(x, τ)` defined in Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time `τ` running from 0 to `β`).\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\psi^\\dagger \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S[\\psi^\\dagger, \\psi]}$\nThe action `S` is given by the time integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian, `L_E`:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, L_E$\nThe Euclidean Lagrangian density is related to the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator `K` by `L_E = ψ†∂_τψ + K_density`, where `K_density` is the density corresponding to the operator `K`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Action for the System**\nFirst, we express the operator `K = -2μN` in terms of the quantum fields `ψ` and `ψ†`. The number operator `N` is given by `N = ∫ d^d x ψ†(x)ψ(x)`. Therefore, the operator `K` corresponds to a density `K_density = -2μψ†ψ`.\n\nThe Euclidean Lagrangian density is:\n`L_E = ψ†∂_τψ + K_density = ψ†∂_τψ - 2μψ†ψ`\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`L_E = ψ†(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ`\nSo, the action for the system is:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^\\dagger(\\vec{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Path Integral**\nThe action is quadratic in the fields, which means the path integral is of the Gaussian type. The result of such an integral is given by the determinant of the operator in the quadratic form:\n$Z = [\\text{Det}(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)]^\\sigma$\nThe exponent `σ` depends on the statistics of the particles:\n*   `σ = +1` for fermions (the fields are Grassmann variables).\n*   `σ = -1` for bosons (the fields are complex variables).\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Determinant**\nTo calculate the determinant, we find the product of the eigenvalues of the operator `∂_τ - 2μ`. The eigenvalues are found by working in a basis where the operator is diagonal, such as the basis of plane waves `e^(i(k·x - ω_n τ))`, where `k` is the momentum and `ω_n` are the Matsubara frequencies. The eigenvalues are `(-iω_n - 2μ)`.\n\nThe determinant is the product of these eigenvalues over all single-particle states (all `k`) and all Matsubara frequencies (all `n`):\n$\\text{Det}(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) = \\prod_{k, n} (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$\nTherefore, the logarithm of the partition function is:\n$\\ln Z = \\sigma \\sum_k \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$\n\n**Step 7: Sum Over Matsubara Frequencies and States**\nThe sum over the Matsubara frequencies `ω_n` is a standard calculation in thermal field theory. The result depends on the particle statistics.\n*   **For Bosons (σ = -1):**\n    $\\ln Z = - \\sum_k \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}) = - \\sum_k \\ln(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n*   **For Fermions (σ = +1):**\n    $\\ln Z = \\sum_k \\ln(1 + e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}) = \\sum_k \\ln(1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n\nThe remaining sum is over all single-particle states `k`. In this specific problem, the energy term `(-2μ)` is independent of `k`. Therefore, each single-particle state contributes identically to the partition function. If we denote the total number of available single-particle states by `M` (where `M = ∑_k 1`), the sum becomes a simple multiplication by `M`.\n\n*   **For Bosons:** `ln Z = -M \\ln(1 - e^(2βμ))`\n*   **For Fermions:** `ln Z = M \\ln(1 + e^(2βμ))`\n\n**Step 8: Final Expression for Z**\nBy exponentiating the expressions for `ln Z`, we obtain the final partition function.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Operator in the Exponent:** The key is to correctly identify the operator in the grand canonical ensemble as `K = H - μN`, not just `H`.\n2.  **Path Integral Action:** The action `S` must be constructed correctly from the operator `K`. The term `∂_τ` arises from the evolution in imaginary time, and the rest of the Lagrangian density corresponds to `K`.\n3.  **Particle Statistics:** The result of the path integral (and the final partition function) fundamentally depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions. Since the problem does not specify, a complete answer must address both cases.\n4.  **Sum over States:** The sum `∑_k` is over all single-particle states. As the \"energy\" term is independent of `k`, this sum simplifies to a factor `M`, the total number of such states.\n5.  **Convergence:** For the bosonic case, the geometric series implicit in the derivation only converges if `|e^(2βμ)| < 1`, which requires `μ < 0`. This is a physical requirement to prevent an infinite number of particles from occupying the states.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe partition function `Z` depends on the statistics of the particles. Let `M` be the total number of single-particle states.\n\n*   **For a system of bosons:**\n    $Z = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^M = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n\n*   **For a system of fermions:**\n    $Z = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\n<<<Z = (1 - e^(2βμ))^(-M) for bosons and Z = (1 + e^(2βμ))^M for fermions, where M is the number of single-particle states.>>>"
