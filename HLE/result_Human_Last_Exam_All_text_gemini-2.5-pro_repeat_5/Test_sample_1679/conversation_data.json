    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the *first* film that won the Academy Award for *Best Picture* and also showed a *Luxor Obelisk* on screen.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations**\nThere are two famous Luxor Obelisks:\n1.  One remains at its original location in front of the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n2.  The other was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n\nTherefore, we need to look for Best Picture winners that feature scenes in either Luxor, Egypt (showing the temple) or Paris, France (showing the Place de la Concorde).\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically review Best Picture winners for relevant settings**\nWe will go through the winners year by year, starting from the first ceremony, looking for films set in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1st Awards (1927/1928): *Wings***\n    *   This WWI film has scenes where the protagonists are on leave in Paris. However, these scenes focus on interiors like restaurants and hotel rooms, and tight street-level shots. There are no wide, establishing shots that clearly depict the Place de la Concorde.\n\n*   **2nd to 9th Awards (1928 - 1936):**\n    *   Winners from this period include *The Broadway Melody* (New York), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (German frontlines), *Cimarron* (Oklahoma), *Grand Hotel* (Berlin), *Cavalcade* (London), *It Happened One Night* (U.S. East Coast), *Mutiny on the Bounty* (High seas/Tahiti), and *The Great Ziegfeld* (New York). None of these are set in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **10th Awards (1937): *The Life of Emile Zola***\n    *   This biographical film is set almost entirely in Paris, France. It covers the life of the famous French writer Emile Zola and major historical events like the Dreyfus Affair. The film uses establishing shots of Paris to set the scene and convey the atmosphere of the city during this period. Several shots and montages of Paris landmarks are used, including confirmed views of the Place de la Concorde with its prominent Luxor Obelisk.\n\n*   **Subsequent Winners:**\n    *   ***Casablanca* (1942):** Features a famous flashback sequence set in Paris. This montage of Rick and Ilsa falling in love includes shots of Parisian landmarks. It is very likely the Place de la Concorde is among them. However, this film won five years *after* *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n    *   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** As the title suggests, the film is set in Paris and heavily features famous locations, including a musical number set at the Place de la Concorde. This is much later than the 1937 winner.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** The film's journey includes a stop in Paris, where the Place de la Concorde is shown. Again, this is much later.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the chronological findings**\nWhile later films like *Casablanca* and *An American in Paris* also show the Parisian obelisk, the first Best Picture winner to do so was *The Life of Emile Zola*, which won the award for 1937. No earlier winner has a confirmed on-screen depiction of either the Paris or the Luxor obelisk.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
