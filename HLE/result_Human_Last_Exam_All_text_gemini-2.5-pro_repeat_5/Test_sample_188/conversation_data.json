  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the components of the encryption system.\n*   **Plaintext Alphabet:** The secret message is written using a specific set of characters. The problem states this alphabet consists of the \"120 most common Chinese characters\" found in the Shu. So, the size of our alphabet is 120.\n*   **Ciphertext Source:** The message is encrypted using the symbols from the Ching book. The Ching book contains a total of 9999 symbols.\n*   **Encoding Symbols:** The symbols in the Ching are of the type \"yinyang-wuxing\". We need to determine how many unique types of these symbols exist to understand the encoding scheme.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of unique encoding symbols.\nThe symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\". This implies a combination of one yinyang state and one wuxing state.\n*   **Yinyang:** Has 2 states (yin and yang).\n*   **Wuxing (Five Elements):** Has 5 states (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\nTo find the total number of unique symbol types, we multiply the number of states for each component:\nNumber of unique symbols = (Number of yinyang states) × (Number of wuxing states) = 2 × 5 = 10.\nSo, there are 10 distinct symbols available for encoding (e.g., yin-water, yang-water, yin-fire, yang-fire, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of symbols required to represent one character.\nThe message alphabet has 120 different characters. The encoding system uses a \"base\" of 10 unique symbols. We need to find the minimum number of symbols (`k`) required in a sequence to represent any of the 120 characters. This is a classic encoding problem. We need to find the smallest integer `k` such that the number of possible sequences of length `k` is greater than or equal to the size of the alphabet we need to represent.\n*   Number of possible sequences = (Number of unique symbols) ^ `k`\n*   We need: 10^`k` ≥ 120\nLet's test values for `k`:\n*   If `k = 1`: 10^1 = 10. This is not enough to represent 120 characters.\n*   If `k = 2`: 10^2 = 100. This is still not enough to represent 120 characters.\n*   If `k = 3`: 10^3 = 1000. This is more than enough to represent all 120 characters.\nTherefore, a sequence of **3 symbols** from the Ching book is required to encode a single character of the secret message.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the maximum length of the secret message.\nWe have the total number of symbols available and the number of symbols required for each character of the message.\n*   Total symbols available in the Ching book = 9999.\n*   Number of symbols needed per message character = 3.\nTo find the maximum number of characters the message can have, we divide the total number of available symbols by the number of symbols needed per character.\nMaximum message length = Total Symbols / Symbols per Character\nMaximum message length = 9999 / 3\nMaximum message length = 3333\n\n### Careful Points and Red Herrings\n*   The information about the total number of characters in the Shu (\"around 3000\") is irrelevant. The crucial piece of information is the size of the alphabet used for the message, which is 120.\n*   All timing information (12 ms for vision recognition, 10 ns for integer operations, 30 ns for float operations) is completely irrelevant to the calculation of the message length and should be ignored.\n*   The calculation `9999 / 3` results in a whole number, so we don't need to worry about rounding down (using the floor function). There are no leftover symbols.\n\nThe final answer is derived directly from this logical progression.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
