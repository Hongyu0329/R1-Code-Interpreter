    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from algebraic geometry, specifically the theory of stable reduction of curves, with graph theory and combinatorics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Genus 4 curve:** An algebraic curve `C` with genus `g(C) = 4`.\n    *   **Valuation field (K):** A field equipped with a valuation, like the p-adic numbers `Q_p`. This is the standard setting for studying the reduction of algebraic varieties.\n    *   **Jacobian has good reduction:** The Jacobian variety `J(C)` of the curve has a model over the valuation ring of `K` that is an abelian scheme. This is a very strong condition.\n    *   **Stable Reduction:** The Stable Reduction Theorem (by Deligne and Mumford) states that after a possible finite extension of the field `K`, the curve `C` has a model whose special fiber is a *stable curve*. A stable curve is a connected, complete curve with only nodal (ordinary double point) singularities, and a finite automorphism group.\n    *   **Types of stable reductions:** This asks for the number of distinct combinatorial structures of the special fiber. A \"type\" is defined by the genera of the irreducible components and their configuration of intersections.\n\n2.  **Apply the Core Constraints:**\n    *   **Constraint from the Jacobian:** A fundamental theorem by Raynaud states that a curve's Jacobian has good reduction if and only if its stable reduction `C_s` is a curve of *compact type*. This means two things:\n        1.  The irreducible components `C_i` of `C_s` are all smooth curves.\n        2.  The dual graph of `C_s` is a tree. (The vertices of the dual graph represent the components `C_i`, and the edges represent the nodes where they intersect).\n    *   **Genus Formula:** For a curve of compact type, the genus formula simplifies. If `g` is the total genus and `g_i` are the genera of the components, then `g = Σ g_i`. In our case, `Σ g_i = 4`.\n    *   **Constraint from Stability:** The special fiber `C_s` must be a stable curve. For an unmarked curve, stability imposes a condition on rational components (components of genus 0).\n        *   Any component `C_i` with genus `g_i = 0` (i.e., a projective line `P^1`) must have at least three nodes connecting it to other components.\n        *   In terms of the dual graph, this means any vertex corresponding to a `g=0` component must have a degree of at least 3.\n\n3.  **The Combinatorial Problem:**\n    The problem reduces to finding the number of non-isomorphic, vertex-labeled trees that satisfy the given conditions. A \"type\" corresponds to such a labeled tree.\n    *   The graph must be a tree `T`.\n    *   The vertices are labeled by non-negative integers `g_i` (the genera of the components).\n    *   The sum of the labels must be 4 (`Σ g_i = 4`).\n    *   Any vertex with label `g_i = 0` must have a degree of at least 3.\n\n### Listing and Counting the Types\n\nWe systematically enumerate the possibilities by partitioning the integer 4 into a sum of non-negative integers `g_i`. Let `n` be the number of components (vertices).\n\n**Case 1: Partitions into positive integers (no `g=0` components)**\nThe degree constraint does not apply here.\n*   **Partition {4}:** `n=1`. One component of genus 4. The dual graph is a single vertex (K1). This is the case where the curve `C` itself has good reduction.\n    *   **1 type.**\n*   **Partition {3,1}:** `n=2`. One component of genus 3, one of genus 1. The only tree on 2 vertices is K2 (an edge).\n    *   **1 type.**\n*   **Partition {2,2}:** `n=2`. Two components of genus 2, connected by a node. The tree is K2.\n    *   **1 type.**\n*   **Partition {2,1,1}:** `n=3`. Components of genera 2, 1, 1. The only tree on 3 vertices is the path P3. The genus 2 component can either be in the middle or at an end. These are two distinct configurations.\n    *   **2 types.**\n*   **Partition {1,1,1,1}:** `n=4`. Four components of genus 1. There are two non-isomorphic trees on 4 vertices: the path P4 and the star K1,3.\n    *   **2 types.**\n\n**Subtotal for positive partitions: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 types.**\n\n**Case 2: Partitions including `g=0` components**\nHere, any vertex labeled `0` must have degree ≥ 3.\n\n*   **Partition {3,1,0} / {2,2,0}:** `n=3`. The tree is P3. The maximum degree in P3 is 2. So, it's impossible to place a `g=0` component.\n    *   **0 types.**\n*   **Partition {2,1,1,0}:** `n=4`. We need a tree on 4 vertices with a vertex of degree ≥ 3. Only the star graph K1,3 has this property (the center has degree 3). The path P4 does not.\n    *   The central vertex must be the `g=0` component. The three leaves (degree 1) must be labeled with {2, 1, 1}. This gives one unique labeling up to isomorphism.\n    *   **1 type.**\n*   **Partition {1,1,1,1,0}:** `n=5`. We need a tree on 5 vertices with a vertex of degree ≥ 3. There are two such trees:\n    1.  The star graph K1,4 (center has degree 4).\n    2.  The \"star-like\" tree T2 with degree sequence (3, 2, 1, 1, 1).\n    *   For K1,4, the central vertex must be `g=0`. The 4 leaves are labeled with 1. **1 type.**\n    *   For T2, the vertex of degree 3 must be `g=0`. The other vertices are labeled {1,1,1,1}. **1 type.**\n    *   **Total: 2 types.**\n*   **Partition {2,1,0,0} / {1,1,1,0,0} / etc. with two or more g=0 components:** We need a tree with two or more vertices of degree ≥ 3.\n    *   For `n=5`, no tree has two vertices of degree ≥ 3.\n    *   For `n=6`, we consider partitions like {1,1,1,1,0,0}. We need a tree on 6 vertices with two vertices of degree ≥ 3. There are two such trees:\n        1.  The \"double-Y\" graph, with two adjacent degree-3 vertices.\n        2.  The \"dumbbell\" graph, with two non-adjacent degree-3 vertices.\n    *   For the partition **{1,1,1,1,0,0}**, we place the two `g=0` components on the degree-3 vertices. The remaining four leaves are labeled with {1,1,1,1}. Each of the two trees gives one distinct type. **2 types.**\n    *   For the partition **{2,1,1,0,0}**, we again use these two trees. We place the `g=0` components on the degree-3 vertices and label the four leaves with {2,1,1,1}. Each tree gives one distinct labeling type. **2 types.**\n*   **Partitions with three or more `g=0` components:** E.g., {1,1,0,0,0} (`n=5`) or {1,0,0,0,0} (`n=5`). No tree on 5 vertices has three vertices of degree ≥ 3. Similarly, for larger `n` and more `g=0` components, the sum of degrees required (`≥ 3 * #zeros`) quickly exceeds the total sum of degrees available in a tree (`2(n-1)`). Thus, no further types are possible.\n\n**Final Summation:**\n*   Types with no `g=0` components: 7\n*   Types with one `g=0` component: 1 (from {2,1,1,0}) + 2 (from {1,1,1,1,0}) = 3\n*   Types with two `g=0` components: 2 (from {1,1,1,1,0,0}) + 2 (from {2,1,1,0,0}) = 4\n*   Types with more `g=0` components: 0\n\nTotal Number of Types = 7 + 3 + 4 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
