    "Answering this question requires methods from the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the objects**\n*   **G**: A reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The root system of type $E_8$ is special. The corresponding algebraic group is simple, simply connected, and of adjoint type. This means there is a unique group scheme of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$, and our group $G$ is obtained by base change to $\\mathbb{F}_q$. An important consequence is that any group of type $E_8$ is split over any field, and its center is trivial.\n*   **Maximal Torus**: A maximal torus $T$ in $G$ is a subgroup isomorphic to a direct product of copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$, which is maximal for this property. For $E_8$, the rank is 8, so a maximal torus has dimension 8.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational**: A maximal torus $T$ is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational if it is defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to being stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ corresponding to the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n*   **The question**: We need to find the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a formula for the number of tori**\nThe problem of counting rational maximal tori in a reductive group is a classic one. A key result, for instance by G. Lehrer (in \"The number of rational maximal tori in a finite group of Lie type\"), provides a formula for this number under certain conditions.\n\n**Theorem:** Let $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius morphism. If the center $Z(G)$ of $G$ is connected, then the total number of $F$-stable (i.e., $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational) maximal tori in $G$ is given by the formula:\n$$ N = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\nwhere $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the finite group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$, and $T_0$ is a maximally split torus of $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n**Step 3: Check if the conditions of the theorem apply to our case**\n1.  **G is a connected reductive group**: This is given.\n2.  **The center Z(G) is connected**: For a group of type $E_8$, the center is trivial, $Z(G) = \\{e\\}$. A trivial group is connected. So this condition is satisfied.\n3.  **Existence of a maximally split torus $T_0$**: Any group of type $E_8$ is split over any field. This means that $G$ contains a maximal torus $T_0$ that is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, i.e., $T_0$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{G}_m)^8$ as an algebraic group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A split torus is a maximally split torus.\n\nSince all conditions are met, we can use the formula.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the terms in the formula**\nWe need to find the order of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and the order of the group of rational points of the split torus, $|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n\n*   **$|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$**: Since $T_0$ is a split torus of rank 8 over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, it is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{G}_m)^8$. The group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points is $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times)^8$. The order of the multiplicative group of a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q-1$. Therefore, $|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8$.\n\n*   **$|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$**: The order of a finite group of Lie type is given by the Chevalley formula. For a split simple group of rank $r$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the order is given by:\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i} - 1) $$\n    where $N$ is the number of positive roots and $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_r$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group.\n    For type $E_8$:\n    *   The rank is $r=8$.\n    *   The total number of roots is 240, so the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n    *   The degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ are $d_1=2, d_2=8, d_3=12, d_4=14, d_5=18, d_6=20, d_7=24, d_8=30$.\n    Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |E_8(q)| = q^{120}(q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final number**\nNow we just need to compute the ratio:\n$$ N = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{q^{120}(q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing each factor $(q^{d_i}-1)$ by $(q-1)$:\n$$ N = q^{120} \\left(\\frac{q^2-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^8-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{12}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{14}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{18}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{20}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{24}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{30}-1}{q-1}\\right) $$\nUsing the identity $\\frac{q^k-1}{q-1} = 1+q+q^2+\\dots+q^{k-1}$, we get a polynomial in $q$. This is the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\nThe final result is the expression above, which is a polynomial in $q$ of degree $120+(2-1)+(8-1)+(12-1)+(14-1)+(18-1)+(20-1)+(24-1)+(30-1) = 120 + 1+7+11+13+17+19+23+29 = 120+120=240$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$\\frac{q^{120}(q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8}$\n\n<<<$\\frac{q^{120}(q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8}$>>>"
