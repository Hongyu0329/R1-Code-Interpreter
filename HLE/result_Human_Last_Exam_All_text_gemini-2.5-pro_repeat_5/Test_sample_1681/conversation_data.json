    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the equilibrium point for the Prisoner's Dilemma when played in a quantum space.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nFirst, let's analyze the game in a classical context using the given payoff matrix:\n\n```\n          Player 2\n          Cooperate (C)   Defect (D)\n        +---------------+---------------+\nC       |   (5, 5)      |    (0, 7)     | Player 1\n        +---------------+---------------+\nD       |   (7, 0)      |    (1, 1)     |\n        +---------------+---------------+\n```\n\n*   **Payoffs are (Player 1, Player 2).**\n*   **From Player 1's perspective:**\n    *   If Player 2 Cooperates (C), Player 1 gets 7 by Defecting (D) versus 5 by Cooperating (C). So, Player 1 should Defect.\n    *   If Player 2 Defects (D), Player 1 gets 1 by Defecting (D) versus 0 by Cooperating (C). So, Player 1 should Defect.\n*   **Conclusion for Player 1:** Regardless of Player 2's action, Player 1's best strategy is to Defect. This is the dominant strategy.\n*   **From Player 2's perspective:** The game is symmetric, so Player 2's dominant strategy is also to Defect.\n\nThe unique classical **Nash Equilibrium** is (Defect, Defect), which results in a payoff of **(1, 1)** for the players. The dilemma is that this outcome is worse for both players than the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome of **(5, 5)**, which is Pareto optimal.\n\n### Step 2: Introduce the Quantum Framework\n\nWhen the game is played in \"quantum space,\" players can use quantum strategies. The standard framework for this is the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The game begins with the two players' qubits in an entangled state. The question states, \"You design the initial states for an optimal...\". This implies we use a setup that allows for the best possible outcome. This is typically achieved with a maximally entangling operator `J` acting on the initial state `|Cooperate, Cooperate>` (represented as `|00>`).\n    `|ψ_initial> = J|00>`\n*   **Strategies:** Instead of just choosing C or D, players choose a unitary operator (a quantum gate) to apply to their own qubit. This expands the strategy space significantly. The classical strategies C and D are just two specific choices within this vast new space of quantum strategies.\n*   **Measurement:** After the players apply their chosen strategies, the entanglement is reversed by `J†`, and the final state is measured to determine the outcome (CC, CD, DC, or DD) and the corresponding payoffs.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Quantum Equilibrium\n\nThe key result of quantizing the Prisoner's Dilemma is that it can resolve the classical dilemma.\n\n*   **Existence of a New Equilibrium:** In the quantum version of the game (with maximal entanglement), a new Nash Equilibrium appears that was not accessible in the classical game.\n*   **The \"Miracle\" Move:** There exists a specific quantum strategy, let's call it `Q`, which, when played by both players, leads to the cooperative outcome.\n*   **The Equilibrium `(Q, Q)`:** The strategy profile `(Q, Q)` constitutes a Nash Equilibrium. This means that if one player chooses strategy `Q`, the other player has no incentive to unilaterally change their strategy, because any other strategy will result in an equal or lower payoff.\n*   **Payoff at the Quantum Equilibrium:** When both players play the strategy `Q`, the resulting outcome is deterministically (Cooperate, Cooperate). Therefore, the payoff for both players is **(5, 5)**.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Optimality and Stability\n\n*   **Pareto Optimality:** The payoff (5, 5) is Pareto optimal. No other outcome can make one player better off without making the other worse off. This fulfills the condition of designing the game for an \"optimal\" outcome.\n*   **Stability (Nash Equilibrium):** While the detailed mathematical proof is complex and has been a subject of extensive literature, the established result is that for this class of games, the `(Q, Q)` strategy profile is indeed a stable Nash Equilibrium. If a player deviates from `Q` while the other plays `Q`, the deviating player's payoff will not increase. In fact, for many deviation strategies, their payoff will decrease significantly (e.g., to 0 or 1). This stability removes the incentive to defect that plagued the classical game.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe introduction of quantum strategies and an entangled initial state transforms the game. It creates a new, stable equilibrium point that is also the Pareto optimal outcome. This resolves the central dilemma of the classical game. The equilibrium point is the payoff pair associated with this new quantum Nash Equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, under an optimal setup, corresponds to the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome.\n\nThe final answer is the payoff at this equilibrium point.\n\n<<(5,5)>>>"
