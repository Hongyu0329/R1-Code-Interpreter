    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the First Colour:** The question asks for the colour \"produced when combining yellow and blue\". In both subtractive colour theory (like mixing paint) and in the order of colours in a light spectrum, the colour between yellow and blue is **Green**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Second Colour:** The question explicitly states the second colour is **Blue**.\n\n3.  **Define the Range:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range *between* Green and Blue.\n\n4.  **Recall Newton's Colour Circle and Musical Correspondence:** Isaac Newton famously created an analogy between the seven colours of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale. The standard mapping is as follows:\n    *   Red -> C\n    *   Orange -> D\n    *   Yellow -> E\n    *   **Green -> F**\n    *   **Blue -> G**\n    *   Indigo -> A\n    *   Violet -> B\n\n5.  **Interpret the \"Range between Green and Blue\":** In Newton's discrete 7-colour system, the colour Blue immediately follows the colour Green. There is no other named colour from his system that lies between them. Therefore, the phrase \"the range between Green and Blue\" refers to the segment of the spectrum that begins after the Green segment. This segment is the one Newton labelled as Blue. The question is thus asking for the musical note that corresponds to the colour Blue.\n\n6.  **Find the Corresponding Note:** According to the established mapping in Step 4, the colour Blue corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Colour Mixing:** It is essential to correctly identify Green as the result of mixing yellow and blue in this context.\n*   **Newton's System:** The question is specifically about Newton's colour circle, so the answer must be based on his 7-colour spectrum (ROYGBIV) and its direct correspondence with a 7-note musical scale.\n*   **Interpreting \"Range Between\":** This is the most critical point. Since Green and Blue are adjacent in Newton's list, there is no colour *between* them in that specific system. The most logical interpretation is that the question is asking for the note of the colour that comes next after Green, which is Blue. An alternative interpretation, such as a chromatic note (like F#), would go beyond Newton's original 7-note analogy.\n*   **Musical Mapping:** While Newton's original work related the colour proportions to the intervals of a Dorian mode, the most common and widely understood mapping today is a simple one-to-one correlation with the C major scale, with Red as C. This is the standard interpretation for such questions.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The range is specified as being between Green (from yellow + blue) and Blue.\n2.  In Newton's colour-to-note mapping, Green is F and Blue is G.\n3.  The \"range between\" these two adjacent colours points to the second colour in the pair, Blue.\n4.  The note corresponding to Blue is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
