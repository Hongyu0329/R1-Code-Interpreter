    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key figure and context:** The question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the UK during World War II.\n2.  **Identify the core problem:** He was suspected by UK counterintelligence (MI5) of being a German spy.\n3.  **Identify the reason for suspicion:** The prompt explicitly states the suspicion arose because he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\" This is the central clue.\n4.  **Formulate the objective:** The goal is to determine what this concealed, true profession was.\n5.  **Investigate the case:** When Andre Vernault arrived in Britain in 1940, he was interrogated at the London Reception Centre. He told his interrogator that he was a commercial artist.\n6.  **Analyze the discrepancy:** The MI5 interrogator, Major T.A. \"Tin-Eye\" Robertson, noticed that Vernault's hands were rough, calloused, and scarred. This physical evidence was inconsistent with the delicate work of a commercial artist.\n7.  **Uncover the truth:** The discrepancy between his stated profession and his physical appearance made the interrogators suspicious that \"commercial artist\" was a cover story. Under further questioning, Vernault finally admitted his true profession.\n8.  **Reveal the profession and motive for concealment:** Vernault's actual profession was a **lion tamer**. He had concealed this fact because he believed it was so unusual and outlandish that the British authorities would never believe him and would be even more certain that he was a spy making up a bizarre story. He thought claiming a more mundane job would be less suspicious. Ironically, it was this lie that drew suspicion upon him.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe analysis confirms that the profession Andre Vernault concealed was that of a lion tamer, which he hid out of fear that the truth would sound too unbelievable.\n\n<<<Lion tamer>>>"
