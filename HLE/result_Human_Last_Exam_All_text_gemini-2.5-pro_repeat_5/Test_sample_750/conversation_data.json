    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the multi-valued nature of the equation.**\nThe term $i^z$ on the right-hand side is a multi-valued function in complex analysis. The definition is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. Here, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\nThe complex logarithm, $\\log i$, is also multi-valued.\n$\\log i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have:\n$\\log i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nTherefore, $i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\nThe original equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ means that for a complex number $z$ to be a solution, $z \\cdot i$ must be equal to at least one of the values of $i^z$. In other words, there must exist an integer $k$ for which the equality holds.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the equation for a specific branch.**\nLet's fix a branch for the logarithm, corresponding to a specific integer $k$. We need to solve for $z$ in the equation:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\nFor convenience, let $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$. The equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{ziC_k}$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation using a substitution.**\nTo simplify this equation, let's introduce a new variable $w = z \\cdot i$.\nFrom this substitution, we can express $z$ in terms of $w$: $z = \\frac{w}{i} = -wi$.\nNow, substitute $z = -wi$ and $z \\cdot i = w$ into the equation:\n$w = e^{(-wi)iC_k}$\n$w = e^{w C_k}$\nThis equation relates $w$ to the exponential of itself.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Lambert W function to solve for w.**\nThe equation $w = e^{wC_k}$ can be solved for $w$ using the Lambert W function, which is defined as the inverse function of $f(p) = pe^p$. That is, if $pe^p = \\alpha$, then $p = W(\\alpha)$.\nRearrange the equation for $w$:\n$w e^{-wC_k} = 1$\nLet $\\alpha = -C_k$. The equation is $w e^{\\alpha w} = 1$.\nNow, let $p = \\alpha w$. Then $w = p/\\alpha$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$\\frac{p}{\\alpha} e^p = 1 \\implies p e^p = \\alpha$\nThe solutions for $p$ are given by the different branches of the Lambert W function, denoted by $W_n$ for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$p = W_n(\\alpha) = W_n(-C_k)$\nNow, we can find $w$:\n$w = \\frac{p}{\\alpha} = \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{-C_k}$\n\n**Step 5: Find the solutions for z.**\nWe can now find $z$ from $w$ using the relation $z=-wi$:\n$z = -i \\cdot w = -i \\left( \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{-C_k} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\n**Step 6: State the complete solution set.**\nThe set of all solutions to the original equation is the union of all solutions $z$ found for each possible integer value of $k$.\nThus, the complete solution set is given by:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$ for all integers $k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$.\n\n**Careful Points and Special Solutions:**\nThis general formula encompasses all solutions, including simpler ones that can be stated explicitly.\n\n1.  **Solution z=1**:\n    Let's check if $z=1$ is a solution.\n    LHS: $1 \\cdot i = i$.\n    RHS: $i^1 = e^{\\log i} = e^{i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)} = e^{i\\pi/2}e^{i2k\\pi} = i \\cdot 1 = i$.\n    Since the set of values for $i^1$ contains only the single value $i$, the equation $i=i$ is true. So $z=1$ is a solution.\n    In our general formula, $z=1$ is obtained by setting $n=-k$ for any integer $k$.\n\n2.  **Solution z=-1**:\n    Let's check if $z=-1$ is a solution.\n    LHS: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$.\n    RHS: $i^{-1} = e^{-\\log i} = e^{-i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)} = e^{-i\\pi/2}e^{-i2k\\pi} = -i \\cdot 1 = -i$.\n    The set of values for $i^{-1}$ contains only the single value $-i$, so the equation $-i=-i$ is true. So $z=-1$ is a solution.\n    In our general formula, $z=-1$ is obtained by setting $n=k$ for any integer $k$.\n\n3.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions**:\n    If we set $n=0$, we consider the principal branch of the Lambert W function, $W_0$. The solutions are $z_{k,0} = i \\frac{W_0(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n    For the argument of $W_0$ to yield a real value, we need $-C_k \\ge -1/e$.\n    $-C_k = - \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$.\n    If $k \\ge 0$, $-C_k \\le -\\pi/2 < -1/e$, so $W_0(-C_k)$ is complex.\n    If $k \\le -1$, $-C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(-1-4k) \\ge \\frac{3\\pi}{2} > 0$. In this case, $W_0(-C_k)$ is a positive real number.\n    So for each integer $k \\le -1$, $z_{k,0} = i \\frac{\\text{real number}}{\\text{real number}}$ is a purely imaginary number. These form an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions.\n\nThe general formula is the most complete description of all solutions.\n\n<<<The set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by\n$z = i \\frac{W_n(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$\nfor all integers $k$ and $n$, where $W_n$ denotes the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\nThis set includes the solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$.>>>"
