    "This problem requires finding the steady-state solution of a system of linear ordinary differential equations, known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations for a continuous-time Markov chain. The steady-state probabilities are denoted by $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Goal:**\n    We are given a system of four linear differential equations for the probabilities $P_0(t), P_1(t), P_2(t), P_3(t)$ of a system being in one of four states, and a normalization condition.\n    The goal is to find the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$. This corresponds to the sum of the steady-state probabilities $p_0 + p_1$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations:**\n    In the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities become constant, meaning their time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$. Let $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n    The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n    \n    (1) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    (2) $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    (3) $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    (4) $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    (5) $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n    **Careful point:** The second equation provided in the question, $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - ...$, contains a sign error. For a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the flow into state 1 from state 0 should be positive, i.e., $+\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$. The sum of the derivatives $P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3'$ must be zero to conserve total probability. Using the provided equation for $P_1'$ would violate this. We proceed with the corrected, standard form of the equation.\n\n3.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    We can express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$ using equations (1), (3), and (4).\n    \n    From (1):\n    $\\lambda_{01}p_{0} = \\lambda_{10}p_{1} \\implies p_{0} = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} p_{1}$\n    \n    From (3):\n    $(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2} = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} \\implies p_{2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} p_{1}$\n    \n    From (4):\n    $\\lambda_{31}p_{3} = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} \\implies p_{3} = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} p_{2}$\n    \n4.  **Substitute Numerical Values:**\n    The given transition rates are:\n    $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n    $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n    $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n    $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n    $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n    $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the relations for the probabilities:\n    $p_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_{1}$\n    \n    $p_{2} = \\frac{0.4}{0.392 + 0.008} p_{1} = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} p_{1} = p_{1}$\n    \n    $p_{3} = \\frac{0.008}{0.008} p_{2} = 1 \\cdot p_{2} = p_{1}$\n    \n    So we find that $p_2 = p_1$ and $p_3 = p_1$.\n\n5.  **Use the Normalization Condition:**\n    Substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n    $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)p_1 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right)p_1 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right)p_1 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right)p_1 = 1$\n    This gives the value of $p_1$:\n    $p_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    The question asks for $p_0 + p_1$. We can calculate $p_0$ first:\n    $p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n    \n    Now, sum $p_0$ and $p_1$:\n    $p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n    $p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707}$\n    $p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n    \n    Performing the final division:\n    $p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$ is equal to $\\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n<<<0.669/0.707>>>"
