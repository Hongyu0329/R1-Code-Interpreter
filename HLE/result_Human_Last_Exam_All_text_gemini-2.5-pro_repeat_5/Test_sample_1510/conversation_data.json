    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 distinct ways to tile a 2D plane with a repeating pattern. They are also known as the 2D plane crystallographic groups. These groups include translational symmetries as well as rotational and reflectional symmetries.\n    *   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its associated point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the pattern fixed. The translational components of the wallpaper group symmetries (like glide reflections or the translations of the lattice itself) are ignored when determining the point group.\n    *   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of distinct elements (symmetry operations) it contains.\n\n2.  **Identify the Point Groups of Order 2**\n    The crystallographic restriction theorem states that in a periodic lattice, the only possible rotational symmetries are 1-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. The point groups associated with wallpaper groups are built from these rotations and reflections. We need to find which of these point groups have exactly two elements (order 2).\n\n    The possible 2D crystallographic point groups are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, 2mm, 3m, 4mm, 6m. Let's find their orders:\n    *   **Point group '2' (or $C_2$):** This group contains the identity operation and a 180° rotation. It has 2 elements, so its order is 2.\n    *   **Point group 'm' (or $D_1$):** This group contains the identity operation and a single reflection across a line. It has 2 elements, so its order is 2.\n    *   Other point groups have different orders:\n        *   Group '1' ($C_1$) has order 1.\n        *   Group '3' ($C_3$) has order 3.\n        *   Group '4' ($C_4$) has order 4.\n        *   Group '6' ($C_6$) has order 6.\n        *   Group '2mm' ($D_2$) has order 4 (identity, 180° rotation, two reflections).\n        *   Group '3m' ($D_3$) has order 6.\n        *   Group '4mm' ($D_4$) has order 8.\n        *   Group '6mm' ($D_6$) has order 12.\n\n    Therefore, we are looking for wallpaper groups whose point group is either '2' or 'm'.\n\n3.  **List the 17 Wallpaper Groups and Identify Their Point Groups**\n    Now, we list the 17 wallpaper groups and determine the point group for each one.\n\n    *   **Wallpaper groups with point group '2' ($C_2$):**\n        There is only one wallpaper group whose patterns have 2-fold rotational symmetry but no reflection symmetry.\n        1.  **p2**\n\n    *   **Wallpaper groups with point group 'm' ($D_1$):**\n        These groups have reflectional symmetry. They are differentiated by the presence of simple reflections versus glide reflections, and the type of underlying lattice. However, the point group for all of them is 'm' because a glide reflection (reflection plus a translation) corresponds to a simple reflection in the point group.\n        2.  **pm:** Contains simple reflection lines.\n        3.  **pg:** Contains only glide-reflection lines.\n        4.  **cm:** Based on a centered lattice, it contains both simple reflection and glide-reflection lines.\n\n    *   **Other Wallpaper Groups (for completeness):**\n        *   Point group '1': p1\n        *   Point group '2mm': pmm, pmg, pgg, cmm\n        *   Point group '3': p3\n        *   Point group '3m': p3m1, p31m\n        *   Point group '4': p4\n        *   Point group '4mm': p4m, p4g\n        *   Point group '6': p6\n        *   Point group '6mm': p6m\n\n4.  **Count the Results**\n    By listing the groups, we have found all the wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n    *   The group with point group '2' is **p2**.\n    *   The groups with point group 'm' are **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**.\n\n    In total, there are 1 + 3 = 4 wallpaper groups.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between Wallpaper and Point Groups:** It is crucial to remember that the wallpaper group includes translations, while the point group does not. This is why `pg`, which has glide reflections, has the point group `m` (simple reflection).\n*   **Notation:** Be familiar with both the wallpaper group notations (like `p2`, `cm`) and the point group notations (like `2`, `m`).\n*   **Glide Reflection:** A glide reflection is a combination of a reflection and a translation parallel to the line of reflection. For the purpose of determining the point group, only the reflection component is considered.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are four wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. These groups are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
