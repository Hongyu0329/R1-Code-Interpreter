    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset $S \\subseteq G$ is product-free if for all $x, y \\in S$, their product $xy \\notin S$.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free (MIPF) Set:** A product-free set $S$ that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   **A Set Fills a Group:** A subset $S$ fills a group $G$ if $G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup SS \\cup \\{1\\}$.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group $G$ is filled if *every* MIPF set in $G$ fills $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Groups of Order $2q^m$\nLet $G$ be a group of order $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n1.  **Sylow's Theorems:** We look at the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, denoted by $n_q$. According to Sylow's third theorem, $n_q$ must divide the order of the group, so $n_q | 2q^m$, which means $n_q \\in \\{1, 2, q, 2q, ..., q^m, 2q^m\\}$. Also, $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$.\n2.  **Finding $n_q$:** Since $q$ is an odd prime, $2 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod q$. All other possible divisors of $2q^m$ (except 1) are multiples of $q$, so they are congruent to $0 \\pmod q$, not $1 \\pmod q$. Therefore, the only possibility is $n_q=1$.\n3.  **Group Structure:** Since there is only one Sylow $q$-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup. Let this subgroup be $Q$, with $|Q|=q^m$. Let $H$ be a Sylow 2-subgroup, with $|H|=2$. Since $Q$ is normal, $G$ is a semidirect product of $Q$ and $H$. As $|H|=2$, $H \\cong C_2$. So, $G \\cong Q \\rtimes C_2$.\n4.  **Nonabelian Condition:** The question asks for nonabelian groups. A semidirect product $Q \\rtimes C_2$ is abelian if and only if it is the direct product $Q \\times C_2$ and $Q$ is abelian. Since we are interested in nonabelian groups, either the semidirect product is non-trivial (i.e., the homomorphism from $C_2$ to $Aut(Q)$ is not trivial) or $Q$ itself is a nonabelian group. If the product is direct ($G = Q \\times C_2$), then for $G$ to be nonabelian, $Q$ must be nonabelian.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Known Theorems about Filled Groups\nWe use two crucial results from the theory of filled groups:\n*   **Theorem 1:** A direct product $A \\times B$ is a filled group if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are filled groups.\n*   **Theorem 2:** A finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is an abelian group from a specific list (Hegarty's list of abelian filled groups). A $p$-group is always nilpotent.\n\nCombining these facts:\n*   Consider the case $G = Q \\times C_2$ (direct product), where $Q$ must be nonabelian. For $G$ to be filled, $Q$ must be filled. But $Q$ is a nonabelian $q$-group (and thus nilpotent). By Theorem 2, a nonabelian nilpotent group cannot be filled. Therefore, no group of the form $Q \\times C_2$ with $Q$ nonabelian can be a filled group.\n*   This means we only need to consider non-trivial semidirect products $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$.\n\n### Step 4: Constrain the Subgroup Q\nFor a non-trivial semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$ to be filled, it is a known (though non-trivial) result that the normal subgroup $Q$ must be a filled group.\n1.  Since $Q$ is a $q$-group (nilpotent), for it to be filled, it must be an abelian group from Hegarty's list.\n2.  We look for abelian groups of order $q^m$ (with $q$ odd) in the list of filled abelian groups: $\\{C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5, C_2 \\times C_2, C_2 \\times C_4, (C_2)^3, (C_2)^4, C_3 \\times C_3\\}$.\n3.  The only possibilities for $Q$ are:\n    *   $Q = C_3$ (for $q=3, m=1$)\n    *   $Q = C_5$ (for $q=5, m=1$)\n    *   $Q = C_3 \\times C_3$ (for $q=3, m=2$)\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Candidate Groups\nWe now construct the non-trivial semidirect products for each possible $Q$ and check if the resulting group is filled, using established classifications.\n\n*   **Case Q = $C_3$**: The group is $G = C_3 \\rtimes C_2$. There is only one non-trivial action, which results in the symmetric group $S_3$ (also the dihedral group $D_6$). The order is $6 = 2 \\cdot 3^1$. $S_3$ is a known filled group.\n\n*   **Case Q = $C_5$**: The group is $G = C_5 \\rtimes C_2$. There is only one non-trivial action, resulting in the dihedral group $D_{10}$. The order is $10 = 2 \\cdot 5^1$. Dihedral groups $D_{2n}$ are filled if and only if $n \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. Since $n=5$, $D_{10}$ is a filled group.\n\n*   **Case Q = $C_3 \\times C_3$**: The group is $G = (C_3 \\times C_3) \\rtimes C_2$. There are two non-isomorphic nonabelian groups of this form, corresponding to two distinct actions of $C_2$ on $C_3 \\times C_3$.\n    1.  **Action 1 (Split Action):** The $C_2$ generator inverts one generator of $C_3 \\times C_3$ and fixes the other. This group is isomorphic to the direct product $S_3 \\times C_3$. Its order is $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$. Since $S_3$ and $C_3$ are both filled groups, their direct product is also filled.\n    2.  **Action 2 (Inversion Action):** The $C_2$ generator inverts all elements of $C_3 \\times C_3$. This group is also of order 18 but is not isomorphic to $S_3 \\times C_3$. According to the classification of filled groups of small order, this group is not filled.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are precisely the three groups identified above.\n\n1.  The symmetric group $S_3$ (of order $6 = 2 \\cdot 3^1$).\n2.  The dihedral group $D_{10}$ (of order $10 = 2 \\cdot 5^1$).\n3.  The direct product $S_3 \\times C_3$ (of order $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$).\n\nThese are the only such groups.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are the symmetric group $S_3$, the dihedral group $D_{10}$, and the direct product $S_3 \\times C_3$.>>>"
