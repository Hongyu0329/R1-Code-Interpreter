    "This problem asks for the value of the specific heat critical exponent, α, for a system in spatial dimension d=3. The method to be used is the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, which is a cornerstone of renormalization group (RG) theory for calculating critical exponents near the upper critical dimension.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion**\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique used in statistical physics to study critical phenomena. It works by performing calculations in a dimension `d` that is slightly different from the *upper critical dimension* `d_c`, where mean-field theory becomes exact. The small parameter for the expansion is `ϵ = d_c - d`. For the class of models relevant here (the O(n) universality classes, which include the Ising model), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Parameters for the Problem**\n*   Spatial dimension: `d = 3`\n*   Upper critical dimension: `d_c = 4`\n*   Epsilon parameter: `ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`\n\nWe are seeking the exponent `α`, which describes the divergence of the specific heat `C` near the critical temperature `T_c`:\n`C ~ |T - T_c|^(-α)`\n\n**Step 3: Use the Hyperscaling Relation**\nIn RG theory, the critical exponents are not all independent but are related by so-called hyperscaling relations. One of the most important ones connects `α` to the correlation length exponent `ν` and the spatial dimension `d`:\n`α = 2 - dν`\n\nThis relation is valid for `d < d_c`. To find `α`, we first need to find the epsilon expansion for `ν`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Epsilon Expansion for the Exponent ν**\nThe correlation length exponent `ν` can be calculated using the epsilon expansion for the O(n) model (where `n` is the number of components of the order parameter). To the first order in `ϵ`, the result is:\n`ν = 1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\nThis is a standard result from a one-loop RG calculation.\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Epsilon Expansion for α**\nNow we substitute the expression for `ν` into the hyperscaling relation. It is crucial to also express `d` in terms of `ϵ`, i.e., `d = 4 - ϵ`.\n\n`α = 2 - dν = 2 - (4 - ϵ)ν`\n\nSubstitute the expansion for `ν`:\n`α = 2 - (4 - ϵ) * [1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)]`\n\nNow, expand this product and keep only the terms up to the first order in `ϵ`:\n`α = 2 - [ 4 * (1/2) + 4 * (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ - ϵ * (1/2) + O(ϵ^2) ]`\n`α = 2 - [ 2 + (n+2) / (n+8) * ϵ - ϵ/2 + O(ϵ^2) ]`\n`α = - [ (n+2) / (n+8) - 1/2 ] * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n\nCombine the terms inside the bracket:\n`α = - [ (2(n+2) - 1(n+8)) / (2(n+8)) ] * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n`α = - [ (2n + 4 - n - 8) / (2(n+8)) ] * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n`α = - [ (n - 4) / (2(n+8)) ] * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n`α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\n\nThis is the general first-order result for `α` in terms of `n` and `ϵ`.\n\n**Step 6: Apply to the Specific Case**\nThe question does not specify the model (i.e., the value of `n`). However, \"the\" scaling exponent usually implies the most common and fundamental case, which is the **Ising model**. The Ising model corresponds to a one-component order parameter, so `n = 1`.\n\nWe use the values `ϵ = 1` and `n = 1` in our derived formula for `α`:\n`α ≈ (4 - 1) / (2(1+8)) * 1`\n`α ≈ 3 / (2 * 9)`\n`α ≈ 3 / 18`\n`α = 1/6`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Upper Critical Dimension:** It is essential to know that `d_c = 4` for this class of problems.\n2.  **Correct Hyperscaling Relation:** Using `α = 2 - dν` is key.\n3.  **Express `d` in terms of `ϵ`:** A common mistake is to use `d=3` directly in the hyperscaling relation along with an expanded `ν`. One must use `d = 4 - ϵ` to maintain consistency in the expansion.\n4.  **Implied Model:** The question is ambiguous about the order parameter dimension `n`. Assuming the canonical Ising model (`n=1`) is the standard interpretation for such a general question.\n5.  **Approximation Level:** The epsilon expansion is an approximation. Setting `ϵ=1` is a significant extrapolation from `ϵ -> 0`, so the result `α = 1/6 ≈ 0.167` is only an estimate. The actual value for the 3D Ising model is closer to `0.110`. However, `1/6` is the correct answer *within the first-order epsilon expansion framework*.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n*   Framework: First-order epsilon expansion for the O(n) model.\n*   System: `d=3` dimension, implying `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n*   Model: Assumed to be the Ising model, `n=1`.\n*   Formula: `α ≈ (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ϵ`\n*   Calculation: `α ≈ (4 - 1) / (2(1+8)) * 1 = 3 / 18 = 1/6`.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
