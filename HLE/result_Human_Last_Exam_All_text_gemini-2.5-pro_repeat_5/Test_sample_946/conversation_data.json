    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\n*   **Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n*   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n*   **Event:** Junior prom\n*   **Performer:** A cardboard cutout of a fictional singer.\n*   **Goal:** Find the name of this fictional singer.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the specific events of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThis episode features the Teen Girl Squad getting ready for and attending their Junior Prom. A key part of the prom scene is the entertainment.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the \"performance\" at the prom.**\nWhen the girls are at the prom, the \"live music\" is announced. The camera then reveals that the entertainment is not a live band or person, but a simple cardboard cutout of a male singer holding a guitar.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name on the cutout.**\nThe name of the singer is written on the base of the cardboard cutout. Strong Bad, who is \"drawing\" and narrating the comic, reads the name aloud with a questioning tone.\n\n**Step 5: State the identified name.**\nThe name clearly visible on the cutout and spoken by Strong Bad is \"Thompkins\". He is a fictional character within the Homestar Runner universe, meant to be a parody of a sensitive singer-songwriter.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The performer is not a real person or even an animated character in motion; it is explicitly a cardboard cutout. This is the central joke of the scene.\n*   The character \"Thompkins\" is a very minor, one-off character in this context, making the answer highly specific to this episode.\n*   The source is not the main Homestar Runner cartoon, but the \"Teen Girl Squad\" sub-series, which has its own distinct style and humor.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
