    "An analysis of the question to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2 is provided below.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:**\n    We are asked to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the following two polynomial matrices:\n    P1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n    P2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n2.  **Understand the Concept of GCRD:**\n    *   A polynomial matrix D(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)D(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n    *   D(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\n    *   A common right divisor D(s) is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** if any other common right divisor C(s) is also a right divisor of D(s).\n    *   The GCRD is not unique. If D(s) is a GCRD, then so is U(s)D(s) for any unimodular matrix U(s) (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant). Typically, the GCRD is given in a canonical form, such as the row-reduced echelon form.\n\n3.  **Method 1: The Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n    This method involves performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] to reduce it to a row echelon form. The resulting non-zero matrix block is a GCRD.\n\n    *   **Form the stacked matrix M(s):**\n        M(s) =\n        [R1] [s^2 + s, -s]\n        [R2] [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n        [R3] [s, 0]\n        [R4] [-s - 1, 1]\n\n    *   **Perform Elementary Row Operations:** The goal is to introduce zeros by adding polynomial multiples of one row to another. We will use row R3 and R4 to simplify R1 and R2.\n\n        a.  Observe that R1 = (-s) * R4.\n            (-s) * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s, -s], which is exactly R1.\n            Perform the operation: R1 -> R1 + s*R4.\n            [s^2 + s, -s] + s*[-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0].\n            The matrix becomes:\n            [0, 0]\n            [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n            [s, 0]\n            [-s - 1, 1]\n\n        b.  Now, we reduce the remaining non-zero rows. Let's use R3' = [s, 0] to simplify R2' = [-s^2 - 1, s^2].\n            We can write -s^2 - 1 = (-s) * s - 1.\n            Perform the operation: R2' -> R2' + s*R3'.\n            [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s*[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2].\n            The set of non-zero rows is now: {[-1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]}.\n\n        c.  Let the current rows be N1 = [-1, s^2], N2 = [s, 0], N3 = [-s - 1, 1]. Use N1 to simplify N2 and N3.\n            Perform N2 -> N2 + s*N1:\n            [s, 0] + s*[-1, s^2] = [s - s, 0 + s^3] = [0, s^3].\n            Perform N3 -> N3 - (s+1)*N1:\n            [-s - 1, 1] - (s+1)*[-1, s^2] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 - s^2(s+1)] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2].\n            The set of non-zero rows is now: {[-1, s^2], [0, s^3], [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]}.\n\n        d.  Let the current rows be K1 = [-1, s^2], K2 = [0, s^3], K3 = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]. The matrix formed by these rows already contains an upper triangular structure. To achieve a row-reduced form, we need to find the GCRD of the polynomials in the second column: s^3 and 1 - s^3 - s^2. Using the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials:\n            gcd(s^3, 1 - s^3 - s^2) = gcd(s^3 - (-1)(1-s^3-s^2), 1-s^3-s^2) = gcd(1-s^2, 1-s^3-s^2).\n            gcd(1-s^2, 1-s^3-s^2 - (-s)(1-s^2)) = gcd(1-s^2, 1-s^3-s^2+s-s^3) = gcd(1-s^2, 1+s-s^2-2s^3).\n            This seems complicated. Let's restart the reduction from step (b) with a different choice.\n\n        e.  **Alternative Reduction Path (cleaner):** Starting from the set {[-1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]}. Let's use the simplest row N3 = [-s-1, 1] to eliminate the second column of the other rows.\n            Perform N1 -> N1 - s^2*N3:\n            [-1, s^2] - s^2*[-s-1, 1] = [-1 - s^2(-s-1), s^2 - s^2] = [-1 + s^3 + s^2, 0].\n            The rows are now: {[-1 + s^3 + s^2, 0], [s, 0], [-s-1, 1]}.\n\n        f.  Now reduce the first two rows. Let L1 = [-1 + s^3 + s^2, 0] and L2 = [s, 0]. We find the gcd of the polynomials in the first column: gcd(-1+s^3+s^2, s). Since `s` is a factor of s^3 and s^2 but not of -1, the gcd is 1. We can use elementary row operations to obtain a row [1, 0]. For example:\n            L1 -> L1 - (s^2+s)L2 = [-1+s^3+s^2 - s(s^2+s), 0] = [-1, 0].\n            Now use L1' = [-1, 0] to eliminate L2: L2 -> L2 + s*L1' = [0, 0].\n            The set of rows has been reduced to {[-1, 0], [-s-1, 1]}.\n\n        g.  Finally, use L1' = [-1, 0] to eliminate the first element of L3' = [-s-1, 1].\n            Perform L3' -> L3' - (s+1)L1':\n            [-s-1, 1] - (s+1)[-1, 0] = [-s-1 - (s+1)(-1), 1-0] = [-s-1+s+1, 1] = [0, 1].\n            The final set of non-zero rows is {[-1, 0], [0, 1]}.\n\n        h.  To get the canonical row-reduced echelon form, multiply the first row by -1.\n            The resulting GCRD is [[1, 0], [0, 1]].\n\n4.  **Method 2: Rank Analysis**\n    *   A key theorem states that the roots of the determinant of a GCRD D(s) are the values of s for which the rank of the stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] drops below its normal rank (which is the number of columns, n=2, if the matrix has full column rank).\n    *   The rank of M(s) drops below 2 if and only if all of its 2x2 minors are zero.\n    *   Let's compute the determinants of two different 2x2 minors of M(s).\n        *   Minor 1 (from P2): det(P2(s)) = det([[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]) = s*1 - 0 = s.\n        *   Minor 2 (from rows R2 and R4): det([[-s^2-1, s^2], [-s-1, 1]]) = (-s^2-1)*1 - s^2*(-s-1) = -s^2-1 + s^3+s^2 = s^3-1.\n    *   For the rank to drop, both `s` and `s^3-1` must be zero. The roots of `s=0` is just s=0. The roots of `s^3-1=0` are s=1, s=e^(i2π/3), and s=e^(-i2π/3).\n    *   There is no common value of `s` for which both minors are zero. Therefore, the rank of M(s) never drops below 2. It is always 2 for any complex value of s.\n    *   This implies that the determinant of the GCRD, det(D(s)), can have no roots. This means det(D(s)) must be a non-zero constant.\n    *   A polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant is called a unimodular matrix. The simplest unimodular matrix is the identity matrix I.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods lead to the same result. The matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are right coprime. Their greatest common right divisor, in canonical form, is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\nFinal Answer: The greatest common right divisor is the identity matrix.\nD(s) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
