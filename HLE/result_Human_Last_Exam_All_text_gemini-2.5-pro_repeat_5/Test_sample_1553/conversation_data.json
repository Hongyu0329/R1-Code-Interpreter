    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Jacek Dukaj centers around a protagonist named Adam Zamoyski. He is an astronaut from the 21st century who is resurrected in the far future.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the context of relationships in the novel's universe.**\nThe world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a posthuman reality where concepts like identity, existence, and relationships are fundamentally different from our current understanding. A \"marriage\" in this context is not a simple human ceremony but a complex fusion of beings, a strategic alliance, and a transformation of existence.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the character with whom the main character forms a marital bond.**\nAdam Zamoyski, as a \"stahs\" (Standard Human), is considered a primitive curiosity. He becomes entangled in the political machinations of powerful posthuman entities. One of these entities, a vastly powerful being, forms a special bond with him. This character is the Incarnation of Angelina, often referred to simply as Angelina.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the nature of their \"marriage\".**\nThe union between Adam Zamoyski and Angelina is a pivotal plot point. It is a political and existential marriage that elevates Adam from his status as a relic and integrates him into the posthuman power structure. Through this union, he gains immense power and becomes a significant player in the story's central conflict.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Protagonist's Name:** The main character is Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **Spouse's Name:** The character he marries is Angelina (full title: the Incarnation of Angelina).\n*   **Nature of Marriage:** It is crucial to understand that this is not a traditional marriage. It's a futuristic concept of a deep, transformative, and strategic union between a baseline human and a posthuman entity.\n*   **Source:** The information is derived from the plot of Jacek Dukaj's novel.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy following the narrative of the novel, we can definitively identify the character that Adam Zamoyski marries.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
