The following provides the specific residues and their roles based on analysis of scientific literature and structural data, referencing the human beta-1b subunit isoform (UniProt: P54289-1).

**1) Exact residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the Beta Interaction Domain (BID), a hydrophobic groove on the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit, and are critical for the physical binding of the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Valine-259 (V259):** Located in the αA helix of the GK domain, contributes to the hydrophobic binding pocket.
*   **Leucine-297 (L297):** Located in the αB helix, forms a key part of the hydrophobic groove.
*   **Tryptophan-300 (W300):** Located in the αB helix, this large hydrophobic residue is centrally positioned in the binding site and is essential for high-affinity interaction.
*   **Isoleucine-301 (I301):** Located in the αB helix, works alongside L297 and W300 to bind the AID.
*   **Valine-352 (V352):** Located in the αD helix, lines the wall of the binding groove.
*   **Alanine-356 (A356):** Located in the αD helix, contributes to the hydrophobic surface for the interaction.
*   **Leucine-421 (L421):** Located in the αF helix, makes important van der Waals contacts with the AID.

**2) Exact residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues or regions modulate channel function allosterically, often without being part of the primary binding interface. Their modification fine-tunes channel properties like activation and inactivation.

*   **The N-terminal domain (specifically amino acids 1-30):** This entire region acts as a functional hotspot. It is not a single residue but a domain that critically determines the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel inactivation. Its presence or absence profoundly alters the gating behavior of the associated alpha-1 subunit.
*   **Tryptophan-236 (W236):** Located within the SH3 domain. This residue is essential for the structural integrity of the SH3 domain. Mutating it disrupts the SH3 fold, which in turn alters the allosteric modulation of the alpha-1 subunit's gating (e.g., inactivation kinetics), demonstrating the importance of the SH3 domain's structure for fine-tuning channel function.
*   **Aspartic Acid-385 (D385):** Located on a surface loop of the GK domain, away from the main AID binding pocket. This residue is positioned to make secondary contacts with the alpha-1 subunit near the channel pore. Mutations at this site have been shown to specifically alter channel inactivation without disrupting the primary binding, marking it as a hotspot for the allosteric communication that fine-tunes the gate.
