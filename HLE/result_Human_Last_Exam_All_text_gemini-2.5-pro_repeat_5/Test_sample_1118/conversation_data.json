    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo.\n*   **Question:** What object is he holding in his hand, and what is its symbolic meaning of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to an artwork titled \"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\" in German, which translates to \"Self-Portrait with Red Cloth.\" This is the painting created after his imprisonment.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the historical context.**\n*   In early 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany.\n*   They immediately began suppressing political opponents, particularly members of the Communist Party (KPD).\n*   Curt Querner was a member of the KPD and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists (ASSO).\n*   He was arrested by the Gestapo (the Nazi secret police) in March 1933 and held for several weeks.\n*   He painted this self-portrait shortly after his release.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object in his hand.**\nVisual inspection of the painting \"Self-Portrait with Red Cloth\" (1933) clearly shows the artist holding a piece of red fabric or a red rag in his right hand.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the symbolism of the object.**\n*   **The Color Red:** The color red, particularly in the form of a red flag or cloth, has been a potent international symbol of communism, socialism, and the labor movement since the 19th century.\n*   **Querner's Defiance:** Querner was arrested precisely because of his communist beliefs. By prominently featuring a red cloth in a self-portrait immediately after his release, he was making a bold and dangerous statement. It was an act of unwavering defiance, signaling that his imprisonment had not broken his spirit or changed his political convictions. He was openly reaffirming his allegiance to the very ideals the Nazis were trying to crush.\n*   **Conclusion:** The red cloth is not a random object; it is a deliberately chosen symbol of his continued resistance to the Nazi regime and his commitment to his communist ideals.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nBased on the analysis, the object Curt Querner holds in his 1933 self-portrait as a symbol of resistance is a red cloth.\n\n<<<a red cloth>>>"
