    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and its splitting field**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe first try to factor this polynomial. By rearranging and grouping terms, we find a common factor:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The roots of $f(x)$ are the roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the smallest field containing all roots of both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Let $K_1$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$ and $K_2$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$. Then $K$ is the composite field $K_1K_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of each factor**\n1.  For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$: The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of degree 2. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2.  For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:\n    *   **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$, we see that 3 divides all coefficients except the leading one (1), and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term (3). Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois Group:** Since $h(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. To determine which subgroup, we analyze the roots. The derivative is $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. Evaluating $h(x)$ at these points reveals two local extrema with opposite signs, which implies there are three real roots. Since the degree of $h(x)$ is 5, there must be two complex conjugate roots. A theorem states that for an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, if it has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, so $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the composite field**\nThe Galois group of the splitting field $K = K_1K_2$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The structure of $G$ is given by the relation $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_1:\\mathbb{Q}][K_2:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_1 \\cap K_2:\\mathbb{Q}]}$. We need to find the intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2$.\n$K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2$ can be either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. It is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_2$.\nThe subfields of $K_2$ correspond to subgroups of $\\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. Quadratic subfields correspond to subgroups of index 2. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. The fixed field of $A_5$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial $h(x)$.\nFor $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, the discriminant is $D = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-4)^4(-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256(-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe unique quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. Since $\\sqrt{-14863419}$ is not a rational multiple of $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nTherefore, $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the Galois group is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal subfields**\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a subfield $L$ of $K$ corresponds to a subgroup $H$ of $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if its corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means we are looking for proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{0\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe normal subgroups of $G_2 = S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nSince the orders of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $S_5$ are not coprime, we must be careful. The normal subgroups of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$ are not just products of normal subgroups of the factors. A detailed analysis (as shown in the thought block) reveals the following proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$:\n1.  $H_1 = \\{0\\} \\times A_5$. $|H_1| = |A_5| = 60$.\n2.  $H_2 = \\{0\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_2| = |S_5| = 120$.\n3.  $H_3 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_3| = |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 2$.\n4.  $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$. $|H_4| = 2 \\times 60 = 120$.\n5.  $H_5 = \\{(\\text{sgn}(\\sigma), \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in S_5\\}$, where sgn is the sign homomorphism. This is a \"diagonal\" normal subgroup. $|H_5| = |S_5| = 120$.\n\nNow, we calculate the indices of these subgroups to find the degrees of the corresponding normal subfields:\n1.  For $H_1 = \\{0\\} \\times A_5$: $[L_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$.\n2.  For $H_2 = \\{0\\} \\times S_5$: $[L_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n3.  For $H_3 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e\\}$: $[L_3:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n4.  For $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$: $[L_4:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n5.  For $H_5 = \\{(\\text{sgn}(\\sigma), \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in S_5\\}$: $[L_5:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees is the set of these index values.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe possible degrees for such field extensions $L$ are the distinct values from the calculated indices: $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
