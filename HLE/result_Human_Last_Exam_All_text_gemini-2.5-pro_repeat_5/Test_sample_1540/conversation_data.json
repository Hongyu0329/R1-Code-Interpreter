    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective**: Compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n2.  **Input**: Two strings on two separate lines.\n3.  **Constraints**:\n    *   The strings have the same length.\n    *   The length is between 1 and 100 characters.\n    *   The strings consist only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n4.  **Output**:\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n5.  **Core Requirement**: The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we need to minimize the total bytes used by variables.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: The main rule is that 'a' is equivalent to 'A'. Before comparing any two characters, they must be converted to a common case (either both lower or both upper). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n2.  **Lexicographical Order**: The comparison should proceed character by character from the beginning of the strings. The result is determined by the *first* pair of characters that do not match. If all characters match, the strings are equal.\n3.  **Memory Efficiency**: The crucial part of the problem is to use the minimum amount of memory. A standard approach would be to declare two character arrays (buffers) to store both strings, but this might not be the most efficient way. We need to analyze if we can solve the problem without storing both full strings.\n4.  **Input Handling**: Standard input (`stdin`) is a single stream. The strings are on separate lines. This means after reading the first string, we must correctly handle the newline character to begin reading the second string.\n5.  **Variable Sizes**: To calculate the total memory usage accurately, we must use the smallest possible data type for each variable that still satisfies the problem's constraints. For example, if a counter only needs to go up to 100, a `char` (1 byte) is more memory-efficient than an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency, we should avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously if possible.\n\n**Analysis of Input Stream:**\nThe input stream will look like this: `[string1]\\n[string2]\\n`. We read the stream sequentially. We cannot read a character from string 2 until we have processed all of string 1 and the newline character that separates them. This implies that to compare `string1[i]` with `string2[i]`, we must have `string1[i]` available in memory when we read `string2[i]` from the input stream. Therefore, we must store at least the first string.\n\n**The Most Memory-Efficient Strategy:**\n1.  Read the entire first string and store it in a character array (a buffer).\n2.  Read the second string one character at a time from the input stream, without storing the whole string.\n3.  As each character of the second string is read, compare it (case-insensitively) with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n4.  If a difference is found, print the result (`-1` or `1`) and terminate the program.\n5.  If the end of the strings is reached without any difference, they are equal, so print `0`.\n\n**Calculating Memory Usage (m):**\nLet's identify the variables needed for this strategy and choose the smallest possible data types for them.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string**: The maximum length is 100. In C, a string needs a null terminator (`\\0`). So, the buffer must be of size `100 + 1 = 101`.\n    *   `char str1[101];`\n    *   Memory used: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop counter/index**: We need an index to access characters in `str1`. The index will range from 0 to 99. A standard `int` (4 bytes) would work, but a `char` is sufficient, as it can represent values from 0 to 127 (if unsigned) or -128 to 127 (if signed), both of which cover the required range. Using a `char` is more memory-efficient.\n    *   `char i;`\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Variable for the second string's character**: We need a variable to temporarily hold each character of the second string as we read it using `getchar()`. A `char` is perfect for this.\n    *   `char char2;`\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation:**\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n\nm = (memory for string buffer) + (memory for loop counter) + (memory for temporary character)\nm = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte\nm = 103 bytes\n\nThis approach is the most memory-efficient because we have minimized both the number of variables and their data types, while still correctly solving the problem. Storing the first string is unavoidable due to the nature of sequential input streams.\n\n<<<103>>>"
