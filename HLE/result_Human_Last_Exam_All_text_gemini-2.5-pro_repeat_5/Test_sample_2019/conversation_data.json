    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Non-Attacking Conditions\n\n*   **The Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard is a 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. We can represent the squares by coordinates (r, c), where r (row) and c (column) are integers from 0 to 4. Operations on coordinates are performed modulo 5.\n*   **Non-Attacking Queens:** Four queens are non-attacking if no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n    *   **Rows:** If the queens are at (r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4), then r1, r2, r3, r4 must all be distinct.\n    *   **Columns:** c1, c2, c3, c4 must all be distinct.\n    *   **Diagonals:** On a toroidal board, squares (r, c) on the same main diagonal have a constant value for `r - c` (mod 5). So, the values `r1-c1`, `r2-c2`, `r3-c3`, `r4-c4` (mod 5) must all be distinct.\n    *   **Anti-diagonals:** Squares (r, c) on the same anti-diagonal have a constant value for `r + c` (mod 5). So, the values `r1+c1`, `r2+c2`, `r3+c3`, `r4+c4` (mod 5) must all be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the 4-Queens Problem to the 5-Queens Problem\n\nA solution to the 5-queens problem on this board would be a set of 5 positions, {(r0,c0), ..., (r4,c4)}, such that:\n*   The set of rows {r0, ..., r4} is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n*   The set of columns {c0, ..., c4} is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n*   The set of diagonal indices {r0-c0, ..., r4-c4} (mod 5) is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n*   The set of anti-diagonal indices {r0+c0, ..., r4+c4} (mod 5) is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nLet's consider a valid arrangement of 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   They must occupy 4 distinct rows. Let the unused row be `r_u`.\n*   They must occupy 4 distinct columns. Let the unused column be `c_u`.\n*   They must occupy 4 distinct diagonals. Let the unused diagonal index be `d_u`.\n*   They must occupy 4 distinct anti-diagonals. Let the unused anti-diagonal index be `a_u`.\n\nThe position of a potential 5th queen is uniquely determined to be (`r_u`, `c_u`). Let's verify if this 5th queen completes a 5-queen solution. We need to check if its diagonal indices are `d_u` and `a_u`.\n\nThe sum of all indices {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} is 10, which is 0 (mod 5).\nLet the 4 queens be at (r_i, c_i) for i=1,2,3,4.\n*   Sum of rows: `r1+r2+r3+r4 = -r_u` (mod 5).\n*   Sum of columns: `c1+c2+c3+c4 = -c_u` (mod 5).\n*   Sum of diagonal indices: `(r1-c1) + ... + (r4-c4) = -d_u` (mod 5). This sum is also `(r1+...+r4) - (c1+...+c4) = (-r_u) - (-c_u) = c_u - r_u`. So, `-d_u = c_u - r_u`, which means `d_u = r_u - c_u` (mod 5). This is exactly the diagonal index of the position (`r_u`, `c_u`).\n*   Sum of anti-diagonal indices: `(r1+c1) + ... + (r4+c4) = -a_u` (mod 5). This sum is also `(r1+...+r4) + (c1+...+c4) = (-r_u) + (-c_u) = -(r_u+c_u)`. So, `-a_u = -(r_u+c_u)`, which means `a_u = r_u + c_u` (mod 5). This is exactly the anti-diagonal index of the position (`r_u`, `c_u`).\n\nThis proves that any valid arrangement of 4 non-attacking queens can be uniquely extended to a full 5-queen solution by adding a queen at the \"hole\" position. Conversely, removing any queen from a 5-queen solution results in a valid 4-queen arrangement.\n\nThis establishes a bijection: the set of all 4-queen arrangements is equivalent to the set of all possible pairs (S, q), where S is a 5-queen solution and q is one of the 5 queens in S.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens is:\n(Number of 5-queen solutions) × 5.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Number of 5-Queens Solutions\n\nWe need to find the number of 5-queen solutions on the 5x5 toroidal board. This is a known result in combinatorics.\nA solution can be represented by a function `c = p(r)` where `r` is the row and `c` is the column, and `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The conditions for `p` are that the functions `p(r) - r` and `p(r) + r` must also be permutations (modulo 5).\n\nIt is a mathematical theorem that for a prime dimension `n` (like 5), all solutions are \"linear\", meaning they are of the form `p(r) = a*r + b` (mod 5).\nLet's find the valid values for `a` and `b`.\n*   `p(r) = ar+b` is a permutation if `a` is not 0.\n*   `p(r) - r = (a-1)r + b` is a permutation if `a-1` is not 0 (mod 5), so `a ≠ 1`.\n*   `p(r) + r = (a+1)r + b` is a permutation if `a+1` is not 0 (mod 5), so `a ≠ -1 ≡ 4` (mod 5).\n\nSo, `a` can be chosen from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} excluding {0, 1, 4}. The valid choices for `a` are **2** and **3**.\nThe value `b` can be any integer from 0 to 4, representing a cyclic shift of the columns. There are **5** choices for `b`.\n\nTotal number of 5-queen solutions = (choices for `a`) × (choices for `b`) = 2 × 5 = 10.\n\nThe 10 solutions are:\n*   5 solutions from `c = 2r + b` for `b` in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n*   5 solutions from `c = 3r + b` for `b` in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nUsing the relationship established in Step 2 and the result from Step 3:\nNumber of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens = (Number of 5-queen solutions) × 5\nNumber of ways = 10 × 5 = 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
