    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition**\n\nThe \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_r$\" for a rational number $r = p/q$ refers to the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, denoted as $\\alpha_r$. This number $\\alpha_r$ is defined as the larger root of the quadratic equation:\n$qx^2 - (p - q' + 3q)x - p' = 0$\nwhere $p/q$ is the rational number $r$ and $p'/q'$ is its penultimate convergent.\n\n**Step 2: Find the continued fraction and convergents of r = 4/7**\n\nFirst, we express the rational number $r = 4/7$ as a simple continued fraction using the Euclidean algorithm.\n$r_0 = 4/7$. The integer part is $a_0 = \\lfloor 4/7 \\rfloor = 0$.\n$r_1 = 1/(4/7 - 0) = 7/4$. The integer part is $a_1 = \\lfloor 7/4 \\rfloor = 1$.\n$r_2 = 1/(7/4 - 1) = 1/(3/4) = 4/3$. The integer part is $a_2 = \\lfloor 4/3 \\rfloor = 1$.\n$r_3 = 1/(4/3 - 1) = 1/(1/3) = 3$. The integer part is $a_3 = \\lfloor 3 \\rfloor = 3$.\nThe algorithm terminates here. So, the continued fraction for $4/7$ is $[0; 1, 1, 3]$.\n\nFrom this, we identify the values needed for the quadratic equation:\n*   The rational number is $r = p/q = 4/7$, so $p=4$ and $q=7$.\n*   The convergents of $[0; 1, 1, 3]$ are:\n    *   $c_0 = 0/1$\n    *   $c_1 = [0; 1] = 1/1$\n    *   $c_2 = [0; 1, 1] = 1/(1+1) = 1/2$\n    *   $c_3 = [0; 1, 1, 3] = 4/7$\n*   The penultimate convergent is $c_2 = 1/2$. So, $p'=1$ and $q'=2$.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the quadratic equation for $\\alpha_{4/7}$**\n\nSubstitute the values $p=4, q=7, p'=1, q'=2$ into the general equation:\n$qx^2 - (p - q' + 3q)x - p' = 0$\n$7x^2 - (4 - 2 + 3 \\cdot 7)x - 1 = 0$\n$7x^2 - (2 + 21)x - 1 = 0$\n$7x^2 - 23x - 1 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for $\\alpha_{4/7}$**\n\nWe need to find the larger root of the equation $7x^2 - 23x - 1 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$x = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{(-23)^2 - 4(7)(-1)}}{2(7)}$\n$x = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{529 + 28}}{14}$\n$x = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{557}}{14}$\nThe larger root is $\\alpha_{4/7} = \\frac{23 + \\sqrt{557}}{14}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the continued fraction of $\\alpha_{4/7}$**\n\nWe apply the standard algorithm to find the continued fraction of $\\alpha = \\frac{23 + \\sqrt{557}}{14}$.\nFirst, we estimate $\\sqrt{557}$. Since $23^2 = 529$ and $24^2 = 576$, we have $23 < \\sqrt{557} < 24$.\n\n*   **Term 0:**\n    $\\alpha_0 = \\frac{23 + \\sqrt{557}}{14} \\approx \\frac{23 + 23.6}{14} \\approx \\frac{46.6}{14} \\approx 3.32...$\n    So, $a_0 = \\lfloor \\alpha_0 \\rfloor = 3$.\n\n*   **Term 1:**\n    $\\alpha_1 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_0 - a_0} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{23 + \\sqrt{557}}{14} - 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{23 + \\sqrt{557} - 42}{14}} = \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{557} - 19}$.\n    Rationalizing the denominator:\n    $\\alpha_1 = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{557} + 19)}{(\\sqrt{557})^2 - 19^2} = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{557} + 19)}{557 - 361} = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{557} + 19)}{196} = \\frac{\\sqrt{557} + 19}{14}$.\n    $\\alpha_1 \\approx \\frac{23.6 + 19}{14} \\approx \\frac{42.6}{14} \\approx 3.04...$\n    So, $a_1 = \\lfloor \\alpha_1 \\rfloor = 3$.\n\n*   **Term 2:**\n    $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_1 - a_1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{557} + 19}{14} - 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{557} + 19 - 42}{14}} = \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{557} - 23}$.\n    Rationalizing the denominator:\n    $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{557} + 23)}{(\\sqrt{557})^2 - 23^2} = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{557} + 23)}{557 - 529} = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{557} + 23)}{28} = \\frac{\\sqrt{557} + 23}{2}$.\n    $\\alpha_2 \\approx \\frac{23.6 + 23}{2} \\approx \\frac{46.6}{2} \\approx 23.3...$\n    So, $a_2 = \\lfloor \\alpha_2 \\rfloor = 23$.\n\n*   **Term 3:**\n    $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_2 - a_2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{557} + 23}{2} - 23} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{557} + 23 - 46}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{557} - 23}$.\n    Rationalizing the denominator:\n    $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{557} + 23)}{(\\sqrt{557})^2 - 23^2} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{557} + 23)}{557 - 529} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{557} + 23)}{28} = \\frac{\\sqrt{557} + 23}{14}$.\n    We notice that $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{23 + \\sqrt{557}}{14} = \\alpha_0$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nSince $\\alpha_3 = \\alpha_0$, the sequence of remainders repeats from the beginning. This means the continued fraction is purely periodic with a period of length 3. The coefficients of the period are $(a_0, a_1, a_2)$.\nThe continued fraction is $[\\overline{a_0, a_1, a_2}] = [\\overline{3, 3, 23}]$.\n\nFinal check:\nThe number $\\alpha_{4/7}$ is a reduced quadratic irrational ($\\alpha > 1$ and $-1 < \\alpha' < 0$), for which the continued fraction is known to be purely periodic. Our result is consistent with this theorem.\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$ is $[\\overline{3, 3, 23}]$.\n\n<<<[\\overline{3, 3, 23}]>>>"
