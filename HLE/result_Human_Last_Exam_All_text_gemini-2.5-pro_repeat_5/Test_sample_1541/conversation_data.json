    "This is a classic sorting problem disguised as a simple arithmetic task. The key to an efficient solution lies in recognizing the constraints on the input numbers.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Deconstruction**: The goal is to reorder the numbers in a given sum string (e.g., \"3+2+1+4+2\") so that they are in non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+2+2+3+4\"). The numbers involved are only 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n2.  **Identifying Careful Points**:\n    *   **Input Format**: The input is a string containing single-digit numbers separated by '+'. The numbers are at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and the '+' signs are at odd indices.\n    *   **Output Format**: The output must be a string in the same format, with numbers sorted and separated by '+'. There should be no '+' at the end of the string.\n    *   **Limited Number Range**: The most crucial constraint is that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4. This makes a simple counting-based approach much more efficient than a general-purpose sorting algorithm.\n    *   **Memory Efficiency**: The prompt explicitly asks for the *most memory-efficient* C program. This guides our choice of data structures and types. We should avoid creating large temporary arrays and use the smallest appropriate data types for variables.\n\n3.  **Optimal Strategy: Counting Sort**:\n    Instead of extracting the numbers into an array and then sorting them (which would require an auxiliary array of up to 501 integers), we can simply count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). This is the core idea of a Counting Sort.\n\n    *   **Step A: Counting**: We iterate through the input string, looking only at the characters at even indices (the numbers). We use a small array of counters to keep track of how many '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's we find.\n    *   **Step B: Rebuilding**: After counting, we construct the output string by printing the numbers in order. We first print all the '1's, then all the '2's, and so on, placing a '+' between each number.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Memory Calculation\n\nTo find the memory usage `m`, we must design the most memory-efficient C program and sum the sizes of its variables.\n\n**Program Design for Minimal Memory:**\n\n1.  **Input Buffer**: We need a character array to store the input string. Since the maximum length is 1000, we need an array of size 1001 to accommodate the null terminator.\n    *   `char s[1001];`\n\n2.  **Counters**: We need four counters for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The maximum number of summands is 501 (for a string like \"1+1+...+1\" of length 999). A `short` data type (typically 2 bytes) can hold values up to 32,767, which is more than enough for our counts and is smaller than a standard `int` (4 bytes).\n    *   `short counts[4];`\n\n3.  **Loop Variables and Flags**: We need variables for loops and a flag to manage printing the '+' sign correctly. A `short` is also sufficient for these.\n    *   `short i;` (for loops)\n    *   `short first_term_flag;` (to avoid printing '+' before the first number)\n\n4.  **Implementation**: The program will read the string, populate the `counts` array, and then use a series of loops to print the sorted result directly to the console, using the flag to handle the '+' separators. This avoids creating a separate output buffer.\n\n**Calculating Total Memory (`m`)**:\n\nWe sum the memory allocated for each variable, assuming a standard architecture where `sizeof(char) = 1` byte and `sizeof(short) = 2` bytes.\n\n*   **Input string `s`**: `1001 * sizeof(char)` = `1001 * 1` = 1001 bytes\n*   **Counters array `counts`**: `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = 8 bytes\n*   **Loop variable `i`**: `1 * sizeof(short)` = `1 * 2` = 2 bytes\n*   **Flag `first_term_flag`**: `1 * sizeof(short)` = `1 * 2` = 2 bytes\n\n**Total Memory (m)** = 1001 + 8 + 2 + 2 = **1013 bytes**.\n\n<<<1013>>>"
