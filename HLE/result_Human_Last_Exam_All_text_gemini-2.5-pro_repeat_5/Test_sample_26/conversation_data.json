    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Characterize the space X\nLet $X$ be a smooth hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d=5$.\n*   The complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3. As a hypersurface, the complex dimension of $X$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n*   The real dimension of $X$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 2 \\times \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 4$. So $X$ is a 4-dimensional real manifold.\n*   By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, for a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n \\ge 2$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$.\n*   In our case, $n=3$, so the theorem applies for $k < 2$. Thus, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n*   $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, i.e., $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. This can be seen from its CW complex structure which has no 1-cells, or from the long exact sequence of the Hopf fibration $S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$, which means $X$ is a simply connected 4-manifold.\n\n### Step 2: Use the long exact sequence of homotopy for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$\nThe long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_k(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\xrightarrow{j_*} \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_{k-1}(X) \\to \\dots $$\nWe are interested in $\\pi_3(X)$. Let's write out the relevant part of the sequence:\n$$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\xrightarrow{j_*} \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) $$\n\n### Step 3: Determine the homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$\nThe homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ can be related to those of spheres via the long exact sequence for the fibration $S^1 \\to S^{2n+1} \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$. The sequence implies that $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n) \\cong \\pi_k(S^{2n+1})$ for $k \\ge 3$.\nFor our case, $n=3$:\n*   $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7)$. Since $\\pi_i(S^k) = 0$ for $i<k$, we have $\\pi_3(S^7) = 0$. So $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n*   $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_4(S^7)$. Again, since $4<7$, we have $\\pi_4(S^7) = 0$. So $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the long exact sequence and deduce the key isomorphism\nSubstituting these vanishing homotopy groups into our sequence from Step 2:\n$$ 0 \\to \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nThis is a short exact sequence. The map from $0$ being injective means $\\ker(\\partial) = 0$. The map to $0$ being surjective means $\\mathrm{Im}(\\partial) = \\pi_3(X)$. Together, this implies that the boundary map $\\partial: \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X)$ is an isomorphism.\nThus, to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, we need to find the rank of $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n\n### Step 5: Relate relative homotopy to the homotopy of a Thom space\nBy the Pontryagin-Thom construction and the excision theorem for homotopy groups, the relative homotopy group $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is isomorphic to the homotopy group of the Thom space of the normal bundle of $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n$$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\pi_4(T(N_X)) $$\nHere $N_X$ is the normal bundle to $X$. Since $X$ is defined by a degree 5 polynomial, $N_X$ is the complex line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_X(5)$. As a real vector bundle, its rank is 2.\n\n### Step 6: Compute the homotopy group of the Thom space\nThe Freudenthal suspension theorem, in the form of the Thom isomorphism for homotopy groups, states that the suspension map $E: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_{k+r}(T(N_X))$ is an isomorphism for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) - 1$.\n*   Here, $r=2$ (the real rank of $N_X$) and $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X)=4$.\n*   The isomorphism holds for $k < 4-1 = 3$.\n*   Choosing $k=2$, which satisfies $2 < 3$, we have the isomorphism:\n    $$ \\pi_2(X) \\cong \\pi_{2+2}(T(N_X)) = \\pi_4(T(N_X)) $$\n\n### Step 7: Compute $\\pi_2(X)$\nSince $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$), the Hurewicz theorem states that the second homotopy group is isomorphic to the second homology group:\n$$ \\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) $$\nThe rank of $\\pi_2(X)$ is therefore the second Betti number, $b_2(X)$.\n\n### Step 8: Compute the Betti number $b_2(X)$\nFor a smooth complex surface like $X$, the Betti numbers are related to the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. Since $X$ is a simply connected 4-manifold, we have $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=b_1=0, b_4=b_0=1$. The Euler characteristic is given by:\n$$ \\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2 $$\nThe Euler characteristic can be computed by integrating the second Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$: $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X)$.\nThe tangent bundle $T_X$ is found using the adjunction formula for a hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$: $T_X \\oplus N_X \\cong T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X$. This implies $c(T_X) = c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) / c(N_X)$.\n*   $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = (1+H)^4$, where $H$ is the hyperplane class.\n*   $N_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(5)$, so $c(N_X) = 1+5H$.\n*   $c(T_X) = \\frac{(1+H)^4}{1+5H} = (1+4H+6H^2+\\dots)(1-5H+25H^2-\\dots) = 1 - H + 11H^2 + \\dots$\nThe second Chern class is $c_2(T_X) = 11H^2$. The integral is:\n$$ \\chi(X) = \\int_X 11H^2 = 11 \\cdot (\\text{degree of } X) = 11 \\cdot 5 = 55 $$\nNow we find $b_2$:\n$$ 55 = 2 + b_2 \\implies b_2 = 53 $$\nIt is a known result that the homology groups of a smooth complex projective hypersurface are torsion-free. Thus, $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n### Step 9: Conclude the calculation\nPutting all the isomorphisms together:\n1.  $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ (from LES of the pair)\n2.  $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\pi_4(T(N_X))$ (Excision/Thom construction)\n3.  $\\pi_4(T(N_X)) \\cong \\pi_2(X)$ (Thom isomorphism/Freudenthal suspension)\n4.  $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ (Hurewicz theorem)\n5.  $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$ (Betti number calculation)\n\nTherefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$. The rank of this group is the exponent of $\\mathbb{Z}$, which is 53.\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 53.\n\n<<<53>>>"
