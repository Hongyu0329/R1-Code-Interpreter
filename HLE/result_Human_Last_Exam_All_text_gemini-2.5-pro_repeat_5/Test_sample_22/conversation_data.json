    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS is a weighted sum of an individual's genotypes at many different genetic loci (SNPs). The formula is typically `PGS = Σ (effect_size_of_SNP * genotype_at_SNP)`. The crucial point is that the *effect sizes* are *estimated* from a large dataset, usually a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive ability of a PGS:** This is measured by how well the PGS can predict the actual phenotype (e.g., height, disease risk) in a *new, independent* group of people. A common metric for this is R-squared (R²), which represents the proportion of the variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS. Let's call this `R²_PGS`.\n*   **SNP heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical quantity. It represents the proportion of phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by the additive effects of *all* the SNPs being considered, assuming their *true* (not estimated) effects were known. It is the theoretical maximum possible R² that any linear predictor based on these SNPs could achieve. It is often estimated using methods like GREML, which use genome-wide data without estimating individual SNP effects.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between `R²_PGS` and `h²_SNP`.**\n\n1.  **`h²_SNP` is the ceiling:** By its definition, SNP heritability (`h²_SNP`) represents the total amount of signal available in the SNP data. It's the absolute upper limit of how much phenotypic variance can be explained by a linear combination of those SNPs. Think of it as the \"true\" potential predictive power inherent in the genetics.\n\n2.  **PGS is an estimate:** A PGS is a practical attempt to capture that signal. However, it relies on *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS. No matter how large the GWAS, the sample size is finite, which means the estimated effect sizes will always have some degree of statistical error; they are not the \"true\" effect sizes.\n\n3.  **Impact of estimation error:** Because the weights used to build the PGS are imperfect (i.e., they are estimates with some error), the resulting PGS is a \"noisier\" or less-than-optimal predictor compared to a theoretical score built with the true, unknown effect sizes.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of the comparison:** A suboptimal predictor (`PGS` built with estimated effects) will necessarily explain less variance than the theoretically optimal predictor (a score built with true effects). The variance explained by the optimal predictor is `h²_SNP`. Therefore, the variance explained by the practical PGS (`R²_PGS`) must be lower than `h²_SNP`.\n\n**Step 3: List careful points and consider edge cases.**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The source of the gap.** The primary reason `R²_PGS` is lower than `h²_SNP` is the statistical uncertainty in estimating SNP effect sizes from a finite GWAS sample. Other factors, like differing genetic ancestry or Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) patterns between the GWAS sample and the prediction sample, also contribute to lowering the `R²_PGS`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Can they ever be equal?** `R²_PGS` could theoretically equal `h²_SNP` in two scenarios:\n    a) If the SNP heritability is zero (`h²_SNP` = 0). In this case, there is no genetic variance to predict, so the best possible `R²_PGS` is also 0. Here, they are equal, not \"lower\".\n    b) If the PGS were constructed using effect sizes estimated from an infinitely large GWAS sample. In this impossible scenario, the estimated effects would equal the true effects, and `R²_PGS` would equal `h²_SNP`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Interpreting \"necessarily lower\".** In the context of genetics and complex traits, the question implies a non-trivial case where `h²_SNP` > 0 and the PGS is built from real-world data (a finite sample). In every such practical and meaningful scenario, the imperfections in the estimation process guarantee that the predictive ability of the PGS will be lower than the theoretical maximum set by SNP heritability.\n\nGiven that the statement describes the fundamental relationship in any practical application of polygenic scores for heritable traits, it is considered true.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nThe SNP heritability (`h²_SNP`) defines the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by a set of SNPs. A polygenic score's predictive ability (`R²_PGS`) is based on *estimated* SNP effects from finite data. These estimates are inherently imperfect. An imperfect model (the PGS) cannot capture the total available signal (`h²_SNP`). Therefore, the predictive ability of the PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\nTrue\n\n<<<True>>>"
