    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space and its basic properties\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n*   The dimension of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is $k(n-k)$. For $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the dimension is $d = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n*   The manifold $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even or both $k$ and $n-k$ are odd. Here, $k=3$ is odd and $n-k=2$ is even, so $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is orientable. This implies $H^6(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The fundamental group $\\pi_1(G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n))$ for $k, n-k > 1$ and $(k,n) \\neq (2,4)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Since $k=3$ and $n-k=2$, this condition applies. So, $\\pi_1(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   By the Hurewicz theorem, the first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1^{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The integral cohomology ring is $R = H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. We are looking for the rank of the torsion subgroup of $R$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the mod 2 cohomology dimensions\nThe dimensions of the cohomology groups with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, $d_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, can be determined from the structure of the cohomology ring $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$. This ring is given by $\\mathbb{Z}_2[w_1, w_2, w_3]/(\\bar{w}_3, \\bar{w}_4, \\bar{w}_5)$, where $w_i$ are the Stiefel-Whitney classes of the tautological 3-plane bundle $\\gamma^3$ and $\\bar{w}_j$ are the classes of its normal bundle $\\gamma^\\perp$. The relations come from $(1+w_1+w_2+w_3)(1+\\bar{w}_1+\\bar{w}_2)=1$.\nA calculation of the Hilbert series of this ring gives the Poincaré polynomial $P(t) = \\sum d_i t^i$. The coefficients are:\n*   $d_0 = 1$\n*   $d_1 = 1$\n*   $d_2 = 2$\n*   $d_3 = 2$\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_5 = 1$\n*   $d_6 = 1$\n(These numbers also correspond to the number of Schubert cells of each dimension).\n\n### Step 3: Relate integral and mod 2 cohomology via the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT)\nFor a space $X$ whose integral cohomology has only 2-torsion (which is true for real Grassmannians), the UCT provides the following relation:\n$\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}} H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) + \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} \\text{Tors}(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})) + \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} \\text{Tors}(H^{i+1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\nLet $b_i = \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}} H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ be the Betti numbers and $t_i = \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} \\text{Tors}(H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$ be the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in the torsion part of $H^i$. The UCT equation is:\n$d_i = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$.\n\n### Step 4: Use known properties of integral cohomology to find $b_i$ and $t_i$\nWe have the following information:\n1.  $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is connected, so $H^0 = \\mathbb{Z}$, which means $b_0=1$ and $t_0=0$.\n2.  From $H_1=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the UCT for cohomology gives $H^1(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(H_1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(H_0, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0 \\oplus 0 = 0$. So, $b_1=0$ and $t_1=0$.\n3.  Since the manifold is orientable and 6-dimensional, we have Poincaré Duality, which implies $b_i = b_{6-i}$.\n    *   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$\n    *   $b_5 = b_1 = 0$\n    *   $b_4 = b_2$\n4.  Also, $H^6 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, so $t_6=0$. And $H^5 \\cong H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (this can be deduced from duality), so $t_5=1$.\n\nNow we build a system of equations using $d_i = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$:\n*   $d_0=1: 1 = b_0 + t_0 + t_1 = 1 + 0 + 0$. (Consistent)\n*   $d_1=1: 1 = b_1 + t_1 + t_2 = 0 + 0 + t_2 \\implies t_2=1$.\n*   $d_5=1: 1 = b_5 + t_5 + t_6 = 0 + t_5 + 0 \\implies t_5=1$. (Consistent with above)\n*   $d_6=1: 1 = b_6 + t_6 + t_7 = 1 + 0 + 0$. (Consistent)\n*   $d_2=2: 2 = b_2 + t_2 + t_3 = b_2 + 1 + t_3 \\implies b_2 + t_3 = 1$.\n*   $d_4=2: 2 = b_4 + t_4 + t_5 = b_2 + t_4 + 1 \\implies b_2 + t_4 = 1$.\n*   $d_3=2: 2 = b_3 + t_3 + t_4$.\n\nFrom $b_2+t_3=1$ and $b_2+t_4=1$, we deduce $t_3 = t_4$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $d_3$ gives $b_3 + 2t_3 = 2$.\nSince $b_3$ and $t_3$ are non-negative integers, we have two possible solutions:\na) $t_3=0, b_3=2$. This implies $t_4=0$ and from $b_2+t_3=1$, we get $b_2=1$.\nb) $t_3=1, b_3=0$. This implies $t_4=1$ and from $b_2+t_3=1$, we get $b_2=0$.\n\n### Step 5: Use ring structure to resolve the ambiguity\nTo decide between these two cases, we use the fact that the cohomology ring contains Pontryagin classes. The first Pontryagin class of the tautological bundle, $p_1(\\gamma^3)$, is an element of $H^4(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. For $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $k, n-k \\ge 2$, this class is known to be non-zero and of infinite order. Thus, the free part of $H^4$ must be non-trivial, meaning $b_4 \\ge 1$.\n*   Case (a) gives $b_2=1$, so $b_4=1$. This is a valid solution.\n*   Case (b) gives $b_2=0$, so $b_4=0$. This contradicts $b_4 \\ge 1$.\n\nTherefore, Case (a) is the correct one. The torsion ranks are:\n$t_0=0, t_1=0, t_2=1, t_3=0, t_4=0, t_5=1, t_6=0$.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the torsion subgroup and its rank\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group:\n$T = \\text{Tors}(H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 \\text{Tors}(H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$\nUsing the torsion ranks $t_i$ we found:\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^2) = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_2} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^5) = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_5} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\nAll other torsion groups are trivial ($t_i=0$ for $i \\neq 2, 5$).\nSo, the torsion subgroup is $T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$.\n\nThe **rank** of a finitely generated abelian group $A$ is the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition into a free part and a torsion part, i.e., $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus F$ where $r$ is the rank and $F$ is a finite group.\nThe group we are considering is $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$, which is a finite group. Its decomposition has no free part, meaning its rank is 0.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe torsion subgroup is $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The rank of any finite abelian group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
