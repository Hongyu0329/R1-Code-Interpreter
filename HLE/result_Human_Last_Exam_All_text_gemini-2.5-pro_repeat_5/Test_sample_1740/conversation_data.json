    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of identified members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family in humans. This requires consulting authoritative biological databases that catalog miRNAs. The key is to define what constitutes a \"member\" of the family. In miRNA classification, a family is a group of miRNAs with highly similar sequences, particularly in the \"seed region\" (nucleotides 2-8), which determines their target genes. \"Members\" typically refers to the unique mature miRNA sequences.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Primary Data Source**\nThe most reliable and universally accepted database for miRNA sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. The information provided here is based on the data curated in miRBase.\n\n**Step 3: List the Canonical let-7 Members**\nThe core of the let-7 family consists of miRNAs explicitly named \"let-7\". In humans (*Homo sapiens*, prefix \"hsa-\"), these are:\n1.  hsa-let-7a\n2.  hsa-let-7b\n3.  hsa-let-7c\n4.  hsa-let-7d\n5.  hsa-let-7e\n6.  hsa-let-7f\n7.  hsa-let-7g\n8.  hsa-let-7i\n\n**Careful Point 1:** There is no \"let-7h\" identified in humans. This is a common point of confusion.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Other Family Members Based on Sequence Homology**\nMiRNA families are not just defined by name but by sequence. Other miRNAs that share the same seed sequence as the let-7 family are also considered members.\n*   **hsa-miR-98**: This miRNA shares the same seed sequence as the let-7 family (GAGGUAG) and is universally classified as a member.\n\nSo, we add hsa-miR-98 to our list, bringing the count to 9.\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish Between Mature miRNAs and Genes (A Critical Point)**\nThe question asks for \"members,\" which is best interpreted as the number of distinct mature miRNA sequences. It is important not to confuse this with the number of genes (precursor miRNA loci).\n*   Some let-7 members are encoded by multiple genes. For example:\n    *   The mature **let-7a** sequence is produced from three different genes: `let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, and `let-7a-3`.\n    *   The mature **let-7f** sequence is produced from two different genes: `let-7f-1` and `let-7f-2`.\n*   If we were counting the genes, the total would be higher (approximately 12). However, since these multiple genes produce identical mature miRNAs, they are counted as a single \"member\" in terms of function and sequence. The question is about the number of distinct family members, not the number of encoding genes.\n\n**Step 6: Final Tally**\nLet's list all the unique mature let-7 family members identified in humans:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98\n\nSumming these up gives a total of 9 distinct members.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of canonical let-7 miRNAs and other members classified by seed sequence homology in the miRBase database, there are 9 identified members of the let-7 family in humans.\n\n<<<9>>>"
