    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Building Blocks: The Chern Insulator**\n*   A Chern insulator is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by a non-zero integer called the Chern number (C).\n*   The Chern number is a topological invariant of the bulk electronic band structure.\n*   **Physical Significance 1 (Bulk):** The Chern number determines the quantized Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}$) of the material, according to the formula $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where `e` is the elementary charge and `h` is Planck's constant.\n*   **Physical Significance 2 (Boundary):** The Bulk-Boundary Correspondence states that if a Chern insulator with Chern number `C` has a boundary with a topologically trivial insulator (like the vacuum, where C=0), there must exist `|C|` gapless, chiral edge states propagating along that boundary.\n*   In this problem, we start with two identical Chern insulators, each with `C=1`. This means each insulator, when isolated, has a single chiral edge state circulating around its perimeter.\n\n**2. Analyze the Configuration: Lateral Connection with Negligible Tunneling**\n*   **\"Connects laterally\":** The two insulators are placed side-by-side to form a larger, composite system.\n*   **\"Negligible tunneling barrier\":** This is a crucial point. It means the interface between the two insulators is not a hard wall. Electrons can move freely between the two regions. The two systems are strongly coupled and effectively merge into a single, larger system. We need to determine the topological property (the Chern number) of this new composite system.\n\n**3. Method 1: Additivity of Hall Conductance**\nThis is the most direct physical argument.\n*   The Hall conductance, $G_{xy} = \\sigma_{xy} \\times (\\text{geometry factor})$, is quantized in units of $e^2/h$. For a standard Hall bar geometry, the total Hall conductance is $G_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n*   When two electrical conductors are placed in parallel (side-by-side), their conductances add up.\n*   The total Hall conductance of the combined system is the sum of the Hall conductances of the individual parts:\n    $G_{xy}^{\\text{total}} = G_{xy,1} + G_{xy,2}$\n*   Substituting the formula for quantized Hall conductance:\n    $C_{\\text{total}} \\frac{e^2}{h} = C_1 \\frac{e^2}{h} + C_2 \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n*   This directly implies that the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers:\n    $C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2$\n*   Given $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$:\n    $C_{\\text{total}} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n**4. Method 2: Analysis of Edge States (Confirmation via Bulk-Boundary Correspondence)**\nThis method provides a microscopic picture that must be consistent with the bulk property found above.\n*   Let's assume for a C=1 insulator, the edge state circulates counter-clockwise.\n    *   Insulator 1 (left): Has a right-moving state on its top edge, a down-moving state on its right edge, etc.\n    *   Insulator 2 (right): Also has a right-moving state on its top edge, a down-moving state on its right edge, etc.\n\n*   **Consider the internal interface:**\n    *   The right edge of Insulator 1 has a **down-moving** state.\n    *   The left edge of Insulator 2 has an **up-moving** state.\n    *   At the junction, we have two states moving in opposite directions (counter-propagating). Because the tunneling barrier is negligible, these two states can hybridize. This interaction opens an energy gap, effectively \"annihilating\" both edge states at the internal interface.\n\n*   **Consider the outer boundary of the combined system:**\n    *   **Top Edge:** The right-moving state from Insulator 1 and the right-moving state from Insulator 2 are now both on the same combined top edge. Since they are moving in the same direction (co-propagating), they cannot scatter into each other and gap out. They remain as two independent, parallel channels.\n    *   **Bottom Edge:** Similarly, the left-moving states from both insulators coexist on the combined bottom edge, resulting in two parallel left-moving channels.\n\n*   **Conclusion from Edge States:** The composite system has no gapless states at the internal junction, but it has **two** chiral edge states circulating around its outer perimeter. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with two chiral edge states must have a bulk Chern number of `C=2`.\n\n*   Both methods yield the same result, confirming the analysis.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Meaning of \"Junction\":** The question asks for the Chern number *of the junction*. This refers to the bulk topological property of the entire combined system, not just the 1D interface line.\n2.  **Negligible Tunneling Barrier:** This is key. If the barrier were infinite, they would remain two separate systems. Because it's negligible, the edge states at the interface can interact and gap out.\n3.  **Co-propagating vs. Counter-propagating States:** This distinction is critical for the edge state analysis. Counter-propagating states can hybridize and gap out, while co-propagating states cannot and their numbers add up.\n4.  **Additivity of Chern Number:** This is a general principle for stacking or parallel connection of topological systems, as long as the coupling between them does not close the bulk energy gap.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy applying the principle of the additivity of Hall conductance for parallel systems, the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This is confirmed by analyzing the behavior of the chiral edge states, where the internal counter-propagating states are gapped out, while the external co-propagating states add up, resulting in two net chiral modes around the perimeter of the combined system.\n\n$C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
