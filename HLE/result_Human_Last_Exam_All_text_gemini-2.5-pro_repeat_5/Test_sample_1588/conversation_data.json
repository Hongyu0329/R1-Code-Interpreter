    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula and its connection to free Lie algebras.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables. The result is an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\n$Z = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}([X, [X, Y]] + [Y, [Y, X]]) + \\dots$\n\nThe \"order\" of a term corresponds to the total number of $X$'s and $Y$'s in it. For example, $[X, [X, Y]]$ is a term of order 3. The formula can be written as a sum over orders $n$:\n$Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\nwhere $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the sum of all terms of order $n$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Question to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". The terms of order $n$ in the BCH expansion, like $[X,[X,Y]]$ and $[Y,[Y,X]]$ for $n=3$, form a basis for a mathematical structure called the **free Lie algebra** generated by two elements, $X$ and $Y$. Let's denote this by $L(X, Y)$.\n\nThe space $L(X, Y)$ can be decomposed into subspaces of homogeneous elements of degree $n$, denoted $L_n(X, Y)$.\n$L(X, Y) = L_1(X, Y) \\oplus L_2(X, Y) \\oplus L_3(X, Y) \\oplus \\dots$\n\nIt is a known property of the BCH formula that for any chosen basis of $L_n(X, Y)$, all basis elements will appear in the expression for $Z_n$ with a non-zero coefficient. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order $n$ is simply the dimension of the vector space $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\n**Step 3: Use Witt's Formula to find the Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the $n$-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators, $dim(L_n(k))$, is given by **Witt's formula**:\n$dim(L_n(k)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nHere:\n*   $n$ is the order (degree), which is 10 in our case.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 (for $X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe need to calculate $dim(L_{10}(2))$.\n\n1.  **Identify the divisors of n = 10:**\n    The divisors are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a single prime factor)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a single prime factor)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 has two distinct prime factors)\n\n3.  **Apply Witt's formula:**\n    $dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Substitute the values:**\n    $dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right]$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the powers of 2:**\n    *   $2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   $2^5 = 32$\n    *   $2^2 = 4$\n    *   $2^1 = 2$\n\n6.  **Compute the sum inside the brackets:**\n    Sum = $(1 \\cdot 1024) + (-1 \\cdot 32) + (-1 \\cdot 4) + (1 \\cdot 2)$\n    Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2$\n    Sum = $990$\n\n7.  **Complete the final calculation:**\n    $dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The key is to correctly interpret \"number of nonzero coefficients\" as the dimension of the corresponding subspace of the free Lie algebra. This is a standard result in the theory.\n*   **Witt's Formula:** Ensure the correct formula is used. There are similar-looking formulas in combinatorics, so it's important to use the one for free Lie algebras.\n*   **Möbius Function:** The calculation of $\\mu(d)$ must be correct. Remember $\\mu(d)=0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor (e.g., $\\mu(4)=0$), though this is not relevant for $n=10$.\n*   **Arithmetic:** All calculations, especially the powers and the final sum, must be done carefully to avoid errors.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
