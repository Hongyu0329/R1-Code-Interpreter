    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the setup:**\n    *   We have two identical cubes.\n    *   Each cube has a side length of 1.\n    *   One cube is shifted relative to the other.\n    *   The shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n2.  **Establish a Coordinate System:** To analyze the problem mathematically, we place the first cube (let's call it Cube A) in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's define Cube A as the region where:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n3.  **Interpret the \"Main Diagonal\":** The main diagonal of this cube connects opposite vertices. For our choice of Cube A, the most convenient main diagonal to consider is the one connecting the vertex at the origin `(0, 0, 0)` to the vertex `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\n4.  **Interpret the Shift:** This is the most critical step. The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" can be ambiguous. Let's analyze the most plausible interpretation in a geometric context.\n    *   The main diagonal can be seen as a combination of a 1-unit move along the x-axis, a 1-unit move along the y-axis, and a 1-unit move along the z-axis.\n    *   A shift \"by 1/2 along\" this diagonal implies a shift of 1/2 in each of these component directions.\n    *   Therefore, the shift vector **v** is `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n    *   (Note: Another interpretation could be a shift of distance 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal, but this would result in an irrational shift vector `(1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))` and a much more complex answer. The first interpretation is more standard for coordinate geometry problems and leads to a more elegant solution.)\n\n5.  **Define the Second Cube:** The second cube (Cube B) is the translated version of Cube A. We find its coordinates by applying the shift vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) to the boundaries of Cube A.\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n6.  **Find the Intersection:** The volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point `(x, y, z)` belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. This means its coordinates must satisfy both sets of inequalities.\n    *   For x: `x` must be in `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`. The overlap is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   For y: `y` must be in `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`. The overlap is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   For z: `z` must be in `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`. The overlap is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    The intersection is a new cube defined by these overlapping intervals.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is a cube. Its side length is the length of the interval `[1/2, 1]`, which is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`. The volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n    *   Volume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Choice of Coordinates:** Placing one cube at `[0, 1] x [0, 1] x [0, 1]` is the simplest approach.\n*   **The Ambiguity of the Shift:** The most critical point is correctly interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The interpretation of the shift vector as `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)` is key and is justified by mathematical problem-solving conventions and the elegance of the resulting geometry (the center of one cube is a vertex of the other).\n*   **Finding the Intersection Region:** The intersection of two cuboids is found by finding the intersection of the corresponding intervals for each axis. The formula for the intersection of intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` is `[max(a, c), min(b, d)]`.\n*   **Final Volume Calculation:** The resulting shape of the intersection is a cube, and its volume is simply `side³`.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer Step-by-Step\n\n**Step 1:** Define the first cube (Cube A) as the region `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`. Its volume is `1³ = 1`.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the shift vector. The main diagonal vector is `(1, 1, 1)`. A shift of `1/2` along this diagonal is interpreted as the vector `v = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\n**Step 3:** Define the second cube (Cube B) by applying the shift vector to Cube A. This gives the region `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the boundaries of the intersection volume by finding the overlap between the coordinate ranges of Cube A and Cube B.\n*   x-range: Intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   y-range: Intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   z-range: Intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n**Step 5:** The intersection is a cube with side lengths determined by the ranges found in Step 4.\n*   Side length = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\n**Step 6:** Calculate the volume of this intersection cube.\n*   Volume = (Side length)³ = `(1/2)³ = 1/8`.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
