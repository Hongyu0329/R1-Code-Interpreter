    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Pattern**\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that have a characteristic repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil are primarily determined by the packing of amino acid side chains at the core positions, `a` and `d`. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues.\n\nThe given sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nTo find the heptad repeat, we need to identify the pattern of hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W, V, F). The sequence shows a clear repeating pattern of `I` followed three residues later by a large hydrophobic residue (`L` or `W`). This strongly suggests that these are the `a` and `d` positions, respectively (`a` is position 1, `d` is position 4 in a heptad).\n\nLet's assign the `(abcdefg)` positions to the sequence, starting from the first full repeat.\n\nSequence:     `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\nLet's align the core repeating units:\nHeptad 1:     `I A Q S L K E`\nHeptad 2:     `I A K S L K E`\nHeptad 3:     `I A W S L K E`\nHeptad 4:     `I A Q S L K`\n\nBased on this alignment, we can assign the `a` and `d` positions:\n*   **`a` positions:** Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n*   **`d` positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Tryptophan (W), Leucine (L)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Residues at the `a` and `d` Positions**\nThe identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions provides crucial clues about the oligomeric state due to the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing efficiency.\n\n*   **Residues at the `a` position:** All four `a` positions are occupied by **Isoleucine (I)**. Isoleucine is a **β-branched** amino acid (the branching occurs at the first carbon of the side chain). This shape is sterically bulky near the protein backbone.\n*   **Residues at the `d` position:** Three positions are **Leucine (L)**, and one is **Tryptophan (W)**. Leucine is not β-branched and is a very common residue at the `d` position. Tryptophan is the largest and bulkiest amino acid.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Packing Principles to Predict the Oligomeric State**\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a dimeric coiled-coil, the `a` and `d` positions from one helix pack against the `d` and `a` positions of the partner helix, respectively. This packing can accommodate β-branched residues at the `a` position. However, the presence of the extremely bulky Tryptophan (W) at a `d` position would have to pack against an Isoleucine (I) at an `a` position, which could cause significant steric strain.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a trimeric coiled-coil, the `a` positions from all three helices pack against each other in the core, forming a tight `a-a-a` hydrophobic layer. The presence of β-branched Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position is highly unfavorable for trimer formation because the bulky side chains would clash severely in this tight space. Therefore, a trimeric state is very unlikely.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** In a tetrameric coiled-coil, the packing is different. The `a` positions form one hydrophobic core (`a-a-a-a`), and the `d` positions form a separate one (`d-d-d-d`). This packing geometry is known to readily accommodate the β-branched side chain of Isoleucine at the `a` position. The `d` position core is also generally more spacious and can better accommodate the very bulky Tryptophan (W) residue. The pattern of `I` at `a` and `L` at `d` is a classic signature for a tetrameric coiled-coil.\n*   **Higher-Order Oligomers (5+):** While possible, the specific `I` at `a` / `L,W` at `d` pattern is a very strong and well-documented predictor for tetramerization. Without other compelling evidence (like specific inter-helical salt bridges favoring a pentamer or hexamer), the tetramer is the most probable structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n1.  The presence of **Isoleucine (I) at all `a` positions** strongly disfavors the formation of a trimer.\n2.  The combination of **Isoleucine (I) at `a` and Leucine (L) at `d`** is a hallmark of tetrameric coiled-coils.\n3.  The presence of a very **bulky Tryptophan (W) at a `d` position** is better accommodated in the more spacious core of a tetramer than in the interface of a dimer.\n\nBased on these points, the protein sequence is most likely to form a **tetramer**.\n\nThe oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
