    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the specific number of times Anton Chekov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question also correctly points out that these descriptions are symbolic, representing his shifting mentality and fear. To answer this accurately, we must carefully read the text and count every instance where the coat is either described or is the subject of a direct action (putting on, taking off, wrapping).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **What counts as a \"description\"?** We should count not just adjectives describing the coat, but also the significant actions of Otchumyelov putting it on and taking it off, as these are narrative descriptions of the coat's state and function as a symbol.\n2.  **Tracking the character's changes:** Each change in the coat's status directly corresponds to a change in Otchumyelov's judgment about the dog bite incident. We need to follow the plot closely.\n3.  **The specific garment:** The story refers to it as a \"greatcoat\" or \"overcoat.\" We must track all mentions of this specific piece of clothing.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Story**\n\nLet's trace the mentions of the coat through the story's progression.\n\n*   **Instance 1: Initial Appearance**\n    At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced walking across the market square. The text states he is \"in a new greatcoat.\" This establishes his official status and initial state of composure.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **Instance 2: First Change of Opinion**\n    After initially siding with the victim, Hryukin, Otchumyelov hears someone in the crowd say the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. His demeanor immediately changes. He says, \"'H'm. . . . Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin . . . It's frightfully hot!'\" He takes the coat off, symbolizing his sudden \"heat\" or panic at the thought of offending a powerful figure.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Instance 3: Second Change of Opinion**\n    The policeman Yeldyrin reasons that the General doesn't own such a dog. Otchumyelov's confidence returns. He turns on Hryukin, the victim. He says, \"'Put my coat on, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . there's a wind getting up. . . . I am shivering.'\" He puts the coat back on, symbolically resuming his cold, official authority over commoners.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Instance 4: Third Change of Opinion**\n    Hryukin mentions that the General's brother, who recently arrived, might own the dog. The fear of a powerful connection returns. The text says, \"'Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin. . . .'\" Otchumyelov again feels \"hot\" and removes his coat, shedding his authority in deference to potential power.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Instance 5: Fourth Change of Opinion**\n    The General's cook, Prokhor, is questioned and says the dog does not belong to the General or his brother. The threat appears to be gone. Otchumyelov says, \"'Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin.'\" He puts the coat back on to deal with the dog as a mere stray, re-establishing his official, cold stance.\n    *   **Count: 5**\n\n*   **Instance 6: The Final Reversal**\n    Just as the incident is closing, Prokhor casually adds that the dog *does* belong to the General's brother. Otchumyelov's face changes completely to a smile of \"sugary tenderness.\" This time, instead of taking it off, he does the opposite. The story concludes: \"He wraps his greatcoat more closely about him and, turning up the street, disappears from the market-square.\" This final action with the coat symbolizes him retreating into his official shell, using it not for authority, but as a protective shield while he scurries away.\n    *   **Count: 6**\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nBy carefully tracking each time the greatcoat is mentioned or is the subject of a significant action, we arrive at a total of six distinct instances. Each instance is a deliberate choice by Chekov to illustrate the main character's spineless and opportunistic nature.\n\n<<<6>>>"
