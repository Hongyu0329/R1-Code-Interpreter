    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Work and Specific Section**\nThe question refers to Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to find the score for this symphony and look at the very end of the fourth and final movement (IV. Allegro con fuoco). The specific instrument part we need to examine is the \"Violino I\" or First Violin.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Final Measure for the First Violins**\nUpon examining the score, we can see that the symphony concludes with the entire orchestra playing a powerful B-flat major chord, marked *fortississimo* (fff). The very last event for the first violin section is not a sequence of three notes, but a single, sustained chord played for a whole note. In orchestral writing, it is common for a string section like the first violins to be divided (*divisi*) to play the different notes of a chord simultaneously.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Pitches in the Final Chord**\nThe final chord played by the first violin section consists of three distinct pitches. In the treble clef, these notes are:\n1.  **B♭4:** The B-flat on the middle line of the staff.\n2.  **D5:** The D on the fourth line of the staff.\n3.  **F5:** The F in the top space of the staff.\n\nThese three notes (B♭, D, F) together form the tonic B-flat major chord, providing a definitive end to the symphony.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Lowest Note**\nThe question asks for the lowest of these three notes. By comparing the pitches, we can determine their order from lowest to highest:\n*   B♭4\n*   D5\n*   F5\n\nTherefore, the lowest note of the three is B♭4.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is important to understand that \"the first violin\" refers to the entire section, not a single player. This is why they can play a three-note chord at the same time.\n*   The phrase \"ends on three notes\" refers to the three pitches that make up the final chord played by the section, rather than three notes played one after another. This is the most logical musical interpretation of the question, as the final sound is a single chordal event.\n*   The symphony is in the key of B-flat major, so it is musically logical for it to end on a strong B-flat major chord.\n\n<<<B♭4>>>"
