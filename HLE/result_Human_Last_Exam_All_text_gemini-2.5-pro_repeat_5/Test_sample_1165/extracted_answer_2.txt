The estimated maximum magnitude of fluctuations is R = O(ε^(1/2)).
No, the scaling for R(ε) is not expected to remain the same. For the Normal distribution case, the randomness of each source's position is much smaller (variance of O(ε²) in scaled units, compared to O(1) for the uniform case). This reduced randomness in the source term leads to a different scaling for the fluctuations in the solution, which becomes R = O(ε^(3/2)).
