    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the atoms in the molecule.**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C₇H₈.\n*   There are **7 Carbon (C)** atoms.\n*   There are **8 Hydrogen (H)** atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of split-valence basis set developed by Pople. The name describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). A CGF is a fixed linear combination of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). We need to determine the number of CGFs for each type of atom.\n\n*   **For non-hydrogen atoms (like Carbon):**\n    *   The hyphen separates the description of core orbitals from valence orbitals.\n    *   **\"6-\"**: The core orbitals (1s for Carbon) are described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF). This CGF is constructed from 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **\"-31\"**: The valence orbitals (2s and 2p for Carbon) are \"split\" into two parts.\n        *   The \"inner\" part is described by one set of CGFs (one s-type, three p-type). Each of these CGFs is constructed from 3 PGFs.\n        *   The \"outer\" part is described by a second set of CGFs (one s-type, three p-type). Each of these CGFs is uncontracted, meaning it is just a single PGF.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the \"6-\" part of the notation does not apply.\n    *   **\"31\"**: The valence 1s orbital is split into two parts.\n        *   An \"inner\" CGF constructed from 3 PGFs.\n        *   An \"outer\" CGF which is a single PGF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted functions per Carbon atom.**\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** Represented by 1 CGF.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):**\n    *   Inner part (\"3\"): One s-function and a set of p-functions (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂) are used. This gives 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 CGFs.\n    *   Outer part (\"1\"): A second, more diffuse set of functions is used. This also includes one s-function and one set of p-functions. This gives 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 CGFs.\n*   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom** = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of contracted functions per Hydrogen atom.**\n*   **Core:** None.\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):**\n    *   Inner part (\"3\"): Represented by 1 s-type CGF.\n    *   Outer part (\"1\"): Represented by 1 s-type CGF.\n*   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom** = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted functions for the toluene molecule (C₇H₈).**\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** 7 Carbon atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs.\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** 8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs.\n*   **Total number of CGFs** = 63 + 16 = **79**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for *contracted* Gaussian functions (also called basis functions), not *primitive* Gaussian functions. It is crucial to distinguish between them.\n*   **Basis Set Notation:** Correctly interpreting the Pople-style notation (X-YZG) is key. The hyphen separates core from valence. The numbers after the hyphen describe the splitting of the valence shell.\n*   **p-orbitals:** Remember that for second-row elements, a \"p\" basis function always implies a set of three (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂).\n*   **Atom Types:** The rules for Hydrogen are different from second-row elements like Carbon because Hydrogen lacks core electrons.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nTotal CGFs = (Number of C atoms × CGFs per C) + (Number of H atoms × CGFs per H)\nTotal CGFs = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\nTotal CGFs = 63 + 16\nTotal CGFs = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
