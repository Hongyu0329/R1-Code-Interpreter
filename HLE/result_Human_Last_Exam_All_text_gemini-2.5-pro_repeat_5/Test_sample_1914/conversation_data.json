    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\nLet the two objects be $A$ and $B$. A category must have an identity morphism for each object. So, two of the four morphisms must be $id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$. Let the other two morphisms be $f$ and $g$.\n\nLet's denote the number of morphisms from object $X$ to object $Y$ as $n_{XY} = |Hom(X,Y)|$. The total number of morphisms is 4, so we have:\n$n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n_{BB} = 4$.\nSince $id_A \\in Hom(A,A)$ and $id_B \\in Hom(B,B)$, we must have $n_{AA} \\ge 1$ and $n_{BB} \\ge 1$.\n\nWe can classify the categories by the distribution of the two non-identity morphisms, $f$ and $g$. Let $n'_{AA} = n_{AA}-1$ and $n'_{BB} = n_{BB}-1$ be the number of non-identity endomorphisms on $A$ and $B$, respectively. The problem then becomes counting the number of non-negative integer solutions to:\n$n'_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n'_{BB} = 2$.\n\nWe analyze the solutions to this equation, which correspond to different distributions of the two morphisms $f$ and $g$. For each distribution, we determine the number of non-isomorphic ways to define the composition law.\n\nThe possible distributions $(n'_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n'_{BB})$ are:\n\n1.  **(2, 0, 0, 0)**: $n_{AA}=3, n_{AB}=0, n_{BA}=0, n_{BB}=1$.\n    The two non-identity morphisms $f, g$ are both in $Hom(A,A)$. So $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f, g\\}$ and $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B\\}$. There are no morphisms between $A$ and $B$. The structure of such a category is determined by the monoid structure on $Hom(A,A)$. The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7. Each choice gives a distinct category. The case (0,0,0,2) where $n_{BB}=3, n_{AA}=1$ is isomorphic to this one by swapping objects $A$ and $B$.\n    Number of categories: **7**.\n\n2.  **(1, 0, 0, 1)**: $n_{AA}=2, n_{AB}=0, n_{BA}=0, n_{BB}=2$.\n    Here $f \\in Hom(A,A)$ and $g \\in Hom(B,B)$. The category structure is defined by the monoid structures on $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f\\}$ and $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B, g\\}$. There are two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2: $M_1$ where the non-identity element is idempotent ($x^2=x$), and $M_2$ where it has period 2 ($x^2=id$). Let's call them $I$ and $C_2$.\n    The possible pairs of monoids for $(Hom(A,A), Hom(B,B))$ are $(C_2, C_2)$, $(C_2, I)$, $(I, C_2)$, and $(I, I)$. The pair $(C_2, I)$ gives a category isomorphic to the one from $(I, C_2)$ by swapping $A$ and $B$. The others are distinct.\n    Number of categories: **3**.\n\n3.  **(1, 1, 0, 0)**: $n_{AA}=2, n_{AB}=1, n_{BA}=0, n_{BB}=1$.\n    $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f\\}$, $Hom(A,B)=\\{g\\}$, $Hom(B,A)=\\emptyset$, $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B\\}$.\n    The monoid structure on $Hom(A,A)$ is either $I$ ($f^2=f$) or $C_2$ ($f^2=id_A$). The composition $g \\circ f$ must be a morphism in $Hom(A,B)$, so $g \\circ f = g$. This defines the category structure completely. Both choices for the monoid on $Hom(A,A)$ lead to valid (and non-isomorphic) categories.\n    Number of categories: **2**.\n\n4.  **(1, 0, 1, 0)**: $n_{AA}=2, n_{BA}=1, n_{AB}=0, n_{BB}=1$.\n    This is the \"opposite\" case of the previous one. $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f\\}$, $Hom(B,A)=\\{g\\}$. The composition $f \\circ g$ must be in $Hom(B,A)$, so $f \\circ g = g$. Again, there are two choices for the monoid structure of $Hom(A,A)$. These two categories are not isomorphic to the two in case 3.\n    Number of categories: **2**.\n\n5.  **(0, 2, 0, 0)**: $n_{AA}=1, n_{AB}=2, n_{BA}=0, n_{BB}=1$.\n    $Hom(A,B)=\\{f, g\\}$. No non-trivial compositions are possible. The structure is fixed once the domains and codomains are set. This gives one category. The case (0,0,2,0) is isomorphic by swapping A and B.\n    Number of categories: **1**.\n\n6.  **(0, 1, 1, 0)**: $n_{AA}=1, n_{AB}=1, n_{BA}=1, n_{BB}=1$.\n    $Hom(A,B)=\\{f\\}$, $Hom(B,A)=\\{g\\}$. Compositions are $f \\circ g \\in Hom(A,A)$ and $g \\circ f \\in Hom(B,B)$. So $f \\circ g = id_A$ and $g \\circ f = id_B$. This means the objects $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic. This structure is uniquely defined.\n    Number of categories: **1**.\n\n7.  **(0, 1, 0, 1)**: $n_{AA}=1, n_{AB}=1, n_{BA}=0, n_{BB}=2$.\n    $Hom(A,B)=\\{f\\}$, $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B, g\\}$. The monoid structure on $Hom(B,B)$ can be $I$ or $C_2$. The composition $g \\circ f$ must be in $Hom(A,B)$, so $g \\circ f = f$. This gives two non-isomorphic categories.\n    Number of categories: **2**.\n\n8.  **(0, 0, 1, 1)**: $n_{AA}=1, n_{BA}=1, n_{BB}=2$.\n    $Hom(B,A)=\\{f\\}$, $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B, g\\}$. This is the opposite of case 7. The composition is $f \\circ g \\in Hom(B,A)$, so $f \\circ g=f$. This gives two more categories, which are not isomorphic to those in case 7.\n    Number of categories: **2**.\n\nSumming up the number of categories from all non-isomorphic distributions:\n-   Case 1: 7\n-   Case 2: 3\n-   Case 3: 2\n-   Case 4: 2\n-   Case 5: 1\n-   Case 6: 1\n-   Case 7: 2\n-   Case 8: 2\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = 7 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 20."
