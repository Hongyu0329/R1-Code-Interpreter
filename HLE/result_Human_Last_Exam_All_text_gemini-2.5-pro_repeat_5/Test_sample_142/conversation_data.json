    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule and their atomic numbers to find the number of electrons each contributes.\n-   Carbon (C): Atomic number Z=6, so 6 electrons.\n-   Hydrogen (H): Atomic number Z=1, so 1 electron. There are 2 H atoms.\n-   Silicon (Si): Atomic number Z=14, so 14 electrons.\n-   Fluorine (F): Atomic number Z=9, so 9 electrons.\n\nThe total number of electrons (N) in the neutral molecule is the sum:\n$N = (\\text{electrons from C}) + 2 \\times (\\text{electrons from H}) + (\\text{electrons from Si}) + (\\text{electrons from F})$\n$N = 6 + 2 \\times 1 + 14 + 9 = 31$ electrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K)\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions (which corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals, K) for each atom in the 6-31G** basis set. The `**` notation, also written as `(d,p)`, means that d-type polarization functions are added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms.\n\n-   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    -   The 6-31G basis for H gives 2 basis functions (a split 1s orbital).\n    -   The `*` or `(p)` adds a set of 3 p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    -   Total for H = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n\n-   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row heavy atoms):**\n    -   The 6-31G basis for a 2nd-row atom gives 9 basis functions (1s, 2s, 2p split into inner and outer shells).\n    -   The `*` or `(d)` adds a set of 5 d-functions.\n    -   Total for C or F = 9 + 5 = 14 basis functions.\n\n-   **Silicon (Si) (3rd-row heavy atom):**\n    -   The 6-31G basis for a 3rd-row atom gives 13 basis functions (1s, 2s, 2p core + 3s, 3p split-valence).\n    -   The `*` or `(d)` adds a set of 5 d-functions.\n    -   Total for Si = 13 + 5 = 18 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule to get the total number of spatial orbitals, K:\n$K = (\\text{functions on C}) + 2 \\times (\\text{functions on H}) + (\\text{functions on Si}) + (\\text{functions on F})$\n$K = 14 + 2 \\times 5 + 18 + 14 = 14 + 10 + 18 + 14 = 56$ spatial orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the spin state (S)\nThe molecule has 31 electrons, which is an odd number. Therefore, it is a radical. The ground state will have one unpaired electron, corresponding to a doublet spin state with total spin $S = 1/2$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of CSFs\nThe number of CSFs for a given spin state S, for N electrons distributed among K spatial orbitals, is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula. One common form of this formula is:\n$N_{CSF}(K, N, S) = \\binom{K}{N_\\alpha} \\binom{K}{N_\\beta} - \\binom{K}{N_\\alpha+1} \\binom{K}{N_\\beta-1}$\n\nHere, $N_\\alpha$ and $N_\\beta$ are the number of spin-up and spin-down electrons for the highest spin projection component, $M_S = S$.\n-   $N_\\alpha = (N + 2M_S) / 2 = (31 + 2(1/2)) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$\n-   $N_\\beta = (N - 2M_S) / 2 = (31 - 2(1/2)) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula with K=56:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{56}{16} \\binom{56}{15} - \\binom{56}{17} \\binom{56}{14}$\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the expression\nWe need to calculate the values of the binomial coefficients. These are very large numbers.\n-   $\\binom{56}{14} = 2,598,499,741,397,000$\n-   $\\binom{56}{15} = \\binom{56}{14} \\times \\frac{56-15+1}{15} = \\binom{56}{14} \\times \\frac{42}{15} = 7,275,799,275,911,600$\n-   $\\binom{56}{16} = \\binom{56}{15} \\times \\frac{56-16+1}{16} = \\binom{56}{15} \\times \\frac{41}{16} = 18,644,235,644,523,475$\n-   $\\binom{56}{17} = \\binom{56}{16} \\times \\frac{56-17+1}{17} = \\binom{56}{16} \\times \\frac{40}{17} = 43,868,789,751,820,000$\n\nNow, we compute the two terms in the CSF formula:\n-   Term 1 = $\\binom{56}{16} \\times \\binom{56}{15} = (18,644,235,644,523,475) \\times (7,275,799,275,911,600) = 135,639,454,178,494,958,933,458,924,030,000$\n-   Term 2 = $\\binom{56}{17} \\times \\binom{56}{14} = (43,868,789,751,820,000) \\times (2,598,499,741,397,000) = 114,002,824,345,339,665,898,869,095,800,000$\n\nFinally, we subtract the second term from the first:\n$N_{CSF} = 135,639,454,178,494,958,933,458,924,030,000 - 114,002,824,345,339,665,898,869,095,800,000$\n$N_{CSF} = 21,636,629,833,155,293,034,589,828,230,000$\n\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation as approximately $2.164 \\times 10^{31}$.\n\n<<<21636629833155293034589828230000>>>"
