    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A 2D grid of points with integer coordinates (x, y). Movement is restricted to adjacent points, either horizontally or vertically.\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of `n+1` points `p_0, p_1, ..., p_n` where each point `p_i` is a neighbor of `p_{i-1}`. By convention, the walk starts at the origin, `p_0 = (0,0)`.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk in which all points `p_0, p_1, ..., p_n` are distinct. The walk never visits the same point twice.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate for Small Values of n**\n\nLet's compute the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` to understand the pattern and complexity.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible first steps: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    Take any of the 4 walks of length 1. For example, the walk to (1,0). From (1,0), the next step cannot be back to (0,0). The available neighbors are (2,0), (1,1), and (1,-1). There are 3 valid choices. Since this is true for all 4 of the 1-step walks, we have:\n    *   `a(2) = a(1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    Take any of the 12 walks of length 2. Let the walk be `p_0 -> p_1 -> p_2`. The next step to `p_3` cannot be to `p_1`. Can it be to `p_0`? For `p_3` (a neighbor of `p_2`) to be `p_0`, the points `p_0` and `p_2` must be neighbors. On a square grid, if a walk from `p_0` to `p_2` takes 2 steps, `p_0` and `p_2` are never neighbors (they are either 2 units apart on an axis or at a diagonal `sqrt(2)` distance). Therefore, the third step can never return to the origin. This means every 2-step walk has 3 valid extensions.\n    *   `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Increasing Complexity**\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    Now we must extend the 36 walks of length 3. Let the walk be `p_0 -> p_1 -> p_2 -> p_3`. The next step to `p_4` cannot be to `p_2`. Can it be to `p_1` or `p_0`?\n    *   **Case 1 (Most paths):** For most 3-step paths, like the straight path `(0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0)`, the endpoint `(3,0)` is not near any previous points other than `p_2`. It has 3 valid extensions.\n    *   **Case 2 (Paths that turn back):** Consider the path `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1)`. The visited points are `{(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)}`. The endpoint is `p_3=(0,1)`. Its neighbors are `(1,1)`, `(-1,1)`, `(0,2)`, and `(0,0)`. The point `(1,1)` is `p_2` (forbidden) and the point `(0,0)` is `p_0` (also forbidden as it's a visited point). Thus, there are only 2 valid extensions: to `(-1,1)` and `(0,2)`.\n    *   Since the number of valid next steps is not constant but depends on the geometry of the path, we can no longer use a simple multiplicative factor. We must count the number of paths of each \"type\".\n\n**Step 4: The Enumeration Method**\n\nTo find `a(n)` for larger `n`, one must perform an \"exact enumeration\". This is typically done with a computer program using a backtracking (or depth-first search) algorithm. The algorithm explores every possible path of length `n`, pruning branches that revisit a point.\n\nDue to the computational intensity, this calculation is not feasible to perform by hand for `n=10`. The results are well-known and have been pre-computed and tabulated in mathematical and physics literature. This sequence is famously cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411.\n\n**Step 5: The Known Values of a(n)**\n\nLet's list the known values of `a(n)` up to `n=10`:\n*   `a(1) = 4`\n*   `a(2) = 12`\n*   `a(3) = 36`\n*   `a(4) = 100`\n*   `a(5) = 284`\n*   `a(6) = 780`\n*   `a(7) = 2172`\n*   `a(8) = 5916`\n*   `a(9) = 16268`\n*   `a(10) = 44100`\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{44100}$.\n<<<44100>>>"
