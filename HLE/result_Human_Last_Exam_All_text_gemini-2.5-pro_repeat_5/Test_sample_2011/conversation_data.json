    "An analysis of the question is as follows, breaking it down into logical steps.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms:\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** We are working with a graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices `|V|` is 128.\n*   **Clique:** A clique of size `k`, denoted `K_k`, is a subset of `k` vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊂ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *only* the edges from `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs:** This means we are looking for a *single* graph `G` that contains induced subgraphs isomorphic to `K_{k_1}`, `K_{k_2}`, ..., `K_{k_m}` for `m` different sizes `k_i`.\n*   **Maximum possible number of different clique sizes:** We need to find the maximum possible value of `m`.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum size of the set `{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m}` where each `K_{k_i}` is an induced subgraph of a single graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n### Step 2: The Core Insight - The Structure of the Set of Clique Sizes\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between different induced clique sizes within a single graph `G`.\n\nSuppose a graph `G` has an induced clique of size `k`. Let's call the set of `k` vertices that form this clique `S_k`. By definition of an induced clique `K_k`, the subgraph `G[S_k]` is a complete graph on `k` vertices. This means every pair of vertices in `S_k` is connected by an edge in `G`.\n\nNow, consider any integer `j` such that `1 ≤ j < k`. Can we find an induced clique of size `j`?\nYes. We can simply choose any subset of `j` vertices from `S_k`. Let's call this subset `S_j`. Since `S_j` is a subset of `S_k`, and all vertices in `S_k` are pairwise connected, it follows that all vertices in `S_j` must also be pairwise connected.\nThe subgraph induced by `S_j`, which is `G[S_j]`, will therefore be a complete graph on `j` vertices, i.e., a `K_j`.\n\nThis leads to a crucial conclusion:\n**If a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`, it must also contain an induced clique of every size `j` where `1 ≤ j ≤ k`.**\n\nLet `C(G)` be the set of all integers `k` for which an induced `K_k` exists in `G`. Let `k_max` be the largest value in `C(G)`. Based on our reasoning, the set `C(G)` must contain all integers from 1 to `k_max`. Therefore, `C(G) = {1, 2, ..., k_max}`.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is `|C(G)|`, which is simply `k_max`.\n\n### Step 3: Reframing the Problem\n\nThe problem of maximizing the number of different clique sizes is now equivalent to maximizing `k_max`.\n`k_max` is the size of the largest induced clique in the graph `G`. The size of the largest clique (or induced clique, as they are equivalent concepts) in a graph is known as its **clique number**, denoted `ω(G)`.\n\nSo, the original question simplifies to:\n**What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n = 128` vertices?**\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Simplified Problem\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n1.  A clique is a set of vertices. The size of this set cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, for any graph `G` on `n=128` vertices, its clique number `ω(G)` must be less than or equal to 128.\n    `ω(G) ≤ 128`\n\n2.  Can we achieve this maximum value? We need to find a specific graph `G` on 128 vertices that has a clique of size 128. The only way to have a clique of size 128 is if all 128 vertices are pairwise connected. This is the definition of the **complete graph**, `K_{128}`.\n\n3.  Consider the graph `G = K_{128}`. Its vertex set `V` has size 128. By definition, all vertices in `V` form a clique. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128.\nAs established in Step 2, the number of different induced clique sizes in a graph `G` is equal to its clique number `ω(G)`.\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128. This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`, which contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
