    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Substrate**\n\n*   The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n*   First, we must determine the relative stereochemistry (cis or trans) of the substituents. Let's draw the molecule on a planar ring to assign the R/S configuration.\n    *   At C1, the priority of substituents is Br > C2 > C6 > H. For the configuration to be (S), with the lowest priority group (H) pointing away (dash), the sequence Br -> C2 -> C6 must be counter-clockwise. If H is pointing towards you (wedge), the sequence must be clockwise. Let's assume Br is on a dash (away) and H is on a wedge (towards). The path from Br -> C2 -> C6 is clockwise. This results in an (S) configuration at C1.\n    *   At C2, the priority of substituents is C1 > C3 > CH3 > H. For the configuration to be (R), with the lowest priority group (H) pointing away (dash), the sequence C1 -> C3 -> CH3 must be clockwise. If H is pointing towards you (wedge), the sequence must be counter-clockwise. Let's assume the methyl group is also on a dash (away), which means H is on a wedge (towards). The path C1 -> C3 -> CH3 is counter-clockwise. This results in an (R) configuration at C2.\n*   Since both the bromo group at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are on dashes, they are on the same side of the ring. Therefore, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a **cis** isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   The solvent is tert-butyl alcohol.\n*   These conditions strongly favor an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements for E2**\n\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, Br) and the beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must be **trans-diaxial** (one axial-up and the other axial-down). An E2 reaction will not occur if the leaving group is in an equatorial position.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n\n*   As a cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, the molecule exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations where one substituent is axial and the other is equatorial.\n    *   **Conformer A:** Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n    *   **Conformer B:** Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n*   The methyl group (A-value ≈ 1.7 kcal/mol) is sterically bulkier than the bromine atom (A-value ≈ 0.5 kcal/mol). Therefore, the conformation that places the larger methyl group in the more stable equatorial position is the major conformer.\n*   So, **Conformer A (Br axial, Me equatorial) is the more stable and predominant conformation.**\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Reaction Pathway and Product**\n\n*   The E2 reaction must proceed from a conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial. Conformer A, which is the major conformer, already has the bromine atom in the required axial position. The reaction will therefore proceed readily through this conformer.\n*   Now we must look for beta-hydrogens that are trans-diaxial to the axial bromine in Conformer A.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is equatorial. This means the hydrogen on C2 is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) to the axial bromine. Elimination is possible here. Removing this hydrogen and the bromine will form a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is on the same side as the axial bromine (they are both pointing \"down\" or both \"up\", making them syn-periplanar). It is not trans-diaxial to the bromine. Therefore, elimination involving a hydrogen from C6 is not possible via the E2 mechanism from this conformation.\n*   Since the only available anti-periplanar beta-hydrogen is on C2, the base will exclusively remove this proton.\n*   The elimination forms a double bond between C1 and C2, and the methyl group remains attached to C2 (which becomes C1 of the alkene).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction exclusively forms the alkene with the double bond between C1 and C2. This product is named **1-methylcyclohexene**. Although a bulky base was used, which often favors the less substituted (Hofmann) product, the rigid stereochemical requirements of the E2 reaction on this specific substrate dictate that only the more substituted (Zaitsev) product can be formed.\n\n<<<1-methylcyclohexene>>>"
