    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Kanji Character**\nFirst, we must analyze the structure of the character 謄. It is a compound character composed of two distinct parts arranged side-by-side:\n*   The left-hand component is: 言\n*   The right-hand component is: 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese characters with a left-right structure (known as a *hen-tsukuri* structure), the left-hand component (*hen*) is typically the radical used for classification and indexing in dictionaries. In the character 謄, the left-hand component, 言, serves as the radical.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nThe radical 言 itself is known as *gen* (げん) or *kotoba* (ことば). However, radicals often have specific names based on their position within a character. When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is called *gonben* (ごんべん). This is its standard positional name.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name of the radical using Hepburn romanization.\n*   Japanese name: ごんべん\n*   Hiragana breakdown: ご (go) + ん (n) + べ (be) + ん (n)\n*   Hepburn transcription: **Gonben**\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Correctly identifying the components:** It is crucial to correctly parse the character. A misidentification of the left-hand part would lead to an incorrect answer.\n2.  **Understanding positional names:** Many radicals have unique names depending on their position (left, right, top, bottom, etc.). Using the general name (*gen*) would be less precise than using the positional name (*gonben*), which is standard practice as indicated by the example \"Onnahen\".\n3.  **Accurate Romanization:** The transcription from Japanese kana (ごんべん) to Hepburn romanization (Gonben) must be done correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the radical of 謄 is the \"speech\" radical on the left, which is called Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
