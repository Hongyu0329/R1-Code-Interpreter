Based on its role in promoting the survival and development of a less differentiated, memory-like T cell phenotype (Tcm/Tscm), Interleukin-15 would be predicted to generate CAR T cells with a greater functional capacity. Therefore, upon encountering their target antigen, CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15 would be expected to exhibit an **increased** release of key effector cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This heightened cytokine response reflects the superior fitness and effector potential of the memory-like cells favored by IL-15 culture.
