    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring `R = Z/8Z`.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Objects\nA quadratic form in two variables `x, y` over the ring `R = Z/8Z` is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2:\n`q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`, where `a, b, c` are coefficients in `Z/8Z = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, `q_1` and `q_2`, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation `T` such that `q_2(x, y) = q_1(T(x, y))`. An invertible linear transformation is given by:\n`x' = px + qy`\n`y' = rx + sy`\nwhere `p, q, r, s` are in `Z/8Z` and the determinant of the transformation matrix, `ps - qr`, is a unit in `Z/8Z`. The units in `Z/8Z` are the odd numbers: `{1, 3, 5, 7}`.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Initial Classification\nA crucial point is that `Z/8Z` is a ring where 2 is not a unit (it's a zero-divisor). This prevents the standard one-to-one correspondence between quadratic forms and symmetric bilinear forms (which requires division by 2) and complicates diagonalization procedures like completing the square.\n\nA powerful way to classify forms over `Z/p^kZ` (here `p=2, k=3`) is to analyze the associated symmetric bilinear form `B(v, w) = q(v+w) - q(v) - q(w)`. The matrix of this bilinear form is `M_B = [[2a, b], [b, 2c]]`.\n\nThe determinant of this matrix, `det(M_B) = 4ac - b^2`, is a key invariant (up to multiplication by the square of the determinant of the change-of-basis matrix).\nLet's analyze `det(M_B)` modulo 2:\n`det(M_B) mod 2 = (4ac - b^2) mod 2 = -b^2 mod 2 = b mod 2`.\nThis gives a natural primary classification:\n1.  **`b` is odd:** `det(M_B)` is odd (a unit). These are called **unimodular** forms.\n2.  **`b` is even:** `det(M_B)` is even (a non-unit). These are non-unimodular forms.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Unimodular Forms (`b` is odd)\nWhen `b \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}`, the form is non-degenerate when considered over the field `Z/2Z`. Over a field of characteristic 2, any non-degenerate quadratic form in two variables is equivalent to `xy` or `x^2 + xy + y^2`. This structure lifts to `Z/8Z`.\nThe two classes are distinguished by their discriminant `D = 4ac - b^2 \\pmod 8`.\n*   For a form equivalent to `xy` (`a=0, c=0, b=1`), `D = 4(0)(0) - 1^2 = -1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8`.\n*   For a form equivalent to `x^2 + xy + y^2` (`a=1, b=1, c=1`), `D = 4(1)(1) - 1^2 = 3 \\pmod 8`.\n\nSince `3` and `7` cannot be transformed into one another by multiplication with a squared unit (`1^2=1, 3^2=1, 5^2=1, 7^2=1`), these two classes are distinct. All other unimodular forms can be shown to be equivalent to one of these two.\n**Number of unimodular classes = 2.**\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Non-Unimodular Forms (`b` is even)\nWhen `b \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}`, we can further classify these forms based on whether they are \"primitive\" or not. A form `q` is primitive if the ideal generated by its coefficients `(a, b, c)` is `Z/8Z` itself. This is equivalent to at least one of `a, b, c` being a unit. Since `b` is even, this means either `a` or `c` must be a unit (odd).\n\n*   **Subcase 4.1: `b` is even, `a` or `c` is odd (Primitive Forms)**\n    If `a` is a unit, one can always find a transformation to eliminate the `bxy` term (since `b` is even), resulting in a diagonal form `a'x^2 + d'y^2`. It can be shown that these forms fall into classes represented by `ax^2 + dy^2`, where `a \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}` and `d \\in Z/8Z`.\n    The key equivalences for these diagonal forms over `Z/8Z` are:\n    1.  `ax^2 + dy^2 \\sim dx^2 + ay^2` (by swapping `x` and `y`).\n    2.  `ax^2 + dy^2 \\sim ax^2 + (d+4)y^2`.\n    3.  Forms `ax^2+...` are distinct from `a'x^2+...` if `a \\not\\equiv a' \\pmod 4`. This splits the analysis based on `a \\in \\{1, 5\\}` versus `a \\in \\{3, 7\\}`.\n\n    Let's count the classes by choosing a representative `a` from `{1, 3}` and `d` from `{0, 1, 2, 3}`.\n    -   For `a=1`: `x^2`, `x^2+y^2`, `x^2+2y^2`, `x^2+3y^2`. These can be shown to be distinct. (4 classes)\n    -   For `a=3`: `3x^2`, `3x^2+y^2`, `3x^2+2y^2`, `3x^2+3y^2`. These are also distinct from each other and from the `a=1` family. (4 classes)\n    The forms with `a=5` and `a=7` are equivalent to those with `a=1` and `a=3`. For instance, `5x^2+dy^2` is equivalent to a form in the `a=1` family.\n    **Number of classes in this subcase = 4 + 4 = 8.**\n\n*   **Subcase 4.2: `a, b, c` are all even (Non-Primitive Forms)**\n    If `a, b, c \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}`, we can write the form as `q(x, y) = 2q'(x, y)`, where `q'(x, y) = (a/2)x^2 + (b/2)xy + (c/2)y^2` is a quadratic form with coefficients in `Z/4Z`. The number of equivalence classes of such forms over `Z/8Z` is precisely the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms over `Z/4Z`.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Classes over `Z/4Z`\nWe repeat the classification for `q'(x, y) = a'x^2 + b'xy + c'y^2` over `Z/4Z`.\n1.  **`b'` is odd (`1, 3`):** Unimodular forms over `Z/4Z`. Similar to the `Z/8Z` case, there are two representatives: `xy` and `x^2+xy+y^2`. **(2 classes)**\n2.  **`b'` is even (`0, 2`), `a'` or `c'` is odd (`1, 3`):** Primitive, non-unimodular. Can be diagonalized to `a'x^2+d'y^2` with `a'` odd. The equivalence `d' \\sim d'+2` holds over `Z/4Z`.\n    -   For `a'=1`, `d'` can be `0` or `1`. Reps: `x^2`, `x^2+y^2`. (2 classes)\n    -   For `a'=3`, `d'` can be `0` or `1`. Reps: `3x^2`, `3x^2+y^2`. (2 classes)\n    These four forms are all distinct. **(4 classes)**\n3.  **`a', b', c'` are all even (`0, 2`):** Non-primitive. These are forms `2q''` where `q''` is a form over `Z/2Z`. There are 4 such classes over `Z/2Z`, represented by `0`, `x^2`, `xy`, and `x^2+xy+y^2`. **(4 classes)**\n\nTotal classes over `Z/4Z` = 2 + 4 + 4 = 10.\nTherefore, the number of non-primitive classes over `Z/8Z` is 10.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nThe total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the counts from all cases:\n-   Unimodular (`b` odd): 2 classes\n-   Non-unimodular, Primitive (`b` even, `a` or `c` odd): 8 classes\n-   Non-unimodular, Non-primitive (`a,b,c` even): 10 classes\n\nTotal = 2 + 8 + 10 = 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
