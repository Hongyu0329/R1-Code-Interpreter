    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem**\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nWe are also given that their derivatives are always positive, i.e., $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. This means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the equation for fixed points**\nThe fixed points of $h(x) = f(g(x))$ are the solutions to the equation:\n$f(g(x)) = x$\n\nTo find the number of solutions, we can analyze the roots of the function $k(x)$ defined as:\n$k(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the degree of the equation**\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let's say $f(x) = a_3x^3 + \\dots$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let's say $g(x) = b_3x^3 + \\dots$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   The composite function $f(g(x))$ is found by substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$. The highest degree term will be $a_3(b_3x^3 + \\dots)^3 = a_3b_3^3x^9 + \\dots$.\n*   The degree of the composite function $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The function $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is therefore a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n**Step 4: Find the upper bound for the number of fixed points**\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\nSince $k(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $k(x) = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots.\nThis means that the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 5: Determine if this upper bound is achievable**\nNow we must check if it's possible to construct functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in 9 fixed points.\n\n1.  **Analyze the derivative of $k(x)$:** For $k(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative, $k'(x)$, must have 8 distinct real roots (by Rolle's Theorem).\n    $k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    So, we need the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ to have 8 distinct real roots.\n\n2.  **Analyze the function $P(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$:**\n    *   Since $f(x)$ is degree 3, $f'(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial (a parabola). The condition $f'(x)>0$ means this parabola opens upwards and lies entirely above the x-axis.\n    *   Similarly, $g'(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial that opens upwards and is always positive.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a degree 3 polynomial.\n    *   The composite function $f'(g(x))$ has a degree of $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   Therefore, the product $P(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Roots of $P(x) = 1$:** We need to show that it is possible for this degree 8 polynomial $P(x)$ to intersect the horizontal line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points.\n    *   For a degree 8 polynomial to intersect a horizontal line 8 times, it must have a sufficient number of \"wiggles\". Specifically, it needs to have 7 local extrema (4 local minima and 3 local maxima, or vice versa).\n    *   The extrema of $P(x)$ are the roots of its derivative, $P'(x)$. Let's find the degree of $P'(x)$.\n        $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x)) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n    *   Let's check the degrees of the terms:\n        *   $f'(x)$ is degree 2, so $f''(x)$ is degree 1.\n        *   $g'(x)$ is degree 2, so $g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n        *   $f''(g(x))$ is degree $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n        *   $(g'(x))^2$ is degree $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n        *   The first term, $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$, has a degree of $3+4=7$.\n        *   $f'(g(x))$ is degree 6.\n        *   $g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n        *   The second term, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$, has a degree of $6+1=7$.\n    *   The leading coefficients of both terms do not cancel out, so the degree of $P'(x)$ is 7.\n\n4.  **Existence of a suitable configuration:**\n    *   Since $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, it is possible to choose the coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ such that $P'(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots.\n    *   If $P'(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots, then $P(x)$ (a degree 8 polynomial which tends to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$) has 7 local extrema: 4 local minima and 3 local maxima.\n    *   By further adjusting the free parameters in the definitions of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ (for example, the constant terms of the quadratics $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$), we can position the graph of $P(x)$ vertically. It is possible to make the 4 local minima lie below the line $y=1$ and the 3 local maxima lie above the line $y=1$.\n    *   In such a configuration, the graph of $P(x)$ will intersect the line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points. This means $k'(x) = P(x) - 1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   If $k'(x)$ has 8 distinct real roots, then $k(x)$ has 8 local extrema. We can adjust the constant term of $f(x)$ (or $g(x)$), which shifts the graph of $k(x)$ vertically without changing $k'(x)$. By choosing this constant appropriately, we can ensure the values of $k(x)$ at its 8 extrema alternate in sign.\n    *   This guarantees that $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of fixed points is the number of roots of a degree 9 polynomial. The maximum number of roots is therefore 9. The analysis above shows that it is possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and achieve this maximum."
