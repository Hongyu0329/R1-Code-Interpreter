    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position as its starting position.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the final position of the legs is identical to the starting position. This typically refers to the placement of the feet in a closed position, such as fifth position, specifically which foot is in front.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** The step begins in fifth position, with one foot crossed in front of the other (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a vertical jump where the legs beat multiple times in the air. The number \"six\" refers to the six distinct movements of the legs (open from fifth, beat back leg in front, open, beat front leg in back, open, close to fifth). This sequence of beats is designed to return the legs to their original orientation.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in the *exact same* fifth position they started in (e.g., right foot remains in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The number of an entrechat is crucial. Even numbers starting from four (`quatre`, `six`, `huit`, `dix`) indicate a change or return. `Entrechat quatre` changes the feet. `Entrechat six` returns to the original position. `Entrechat huit` changes them again. Therefore, an `entrechat six` specifically ends as it began.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** `Échappé` means to \"escape,\" where the feet jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). `Battu` means \"beaten,\" indicating a beat of the legs on the jump back to fifth. The key term is `changé`, which means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but with the feet switched (e.g., the left foot is now in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word `changé` in the name of the step explicitly tells us that the starting and ending positions will be different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** An `assemblé` (meaning \"to assemble\") typically starts with the working leg extended away from the body after brushing from fifth position. The supporting leg is on the floor.\n    *   **Execution:** The dancer jumps off the supporting leg and brings the working leg in to \"assemble\" with it in the air.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands on both feet simultaneously in fifth position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The position at the start of the jump (one leg extended) is inherently different from the landing position (both feet in fifth). Furthermore, different types of `assemblé` (like `dessus` - over, or `dessous` - under) can result in either maintaining or changing the feet from the original fifth position before the brush. It does not *always* end in the same starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** `Glissade` is a \"glide.\" `Derrière` means \"behind.\" In this step, the dancer glides the foot that starts in front to the side, and then closes the other foot *behind* it.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The foot that was originally in front is now in the back, meaning the feet have changed position (e.g., the left foot is now in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** While there can be some variation in terminology between ballet schools, a `glissade derrière` most commonly functions as a linking step that changes the feet.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative jump, often described as a \"gurgling\" step. It resembles a `pas de chat`, but with a small circle (`rond de jambe`) made by each leg as it is drawn up. It is a traveling step.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The step typically concludes by landing with the opposite foot in front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Due to its nature as a compound traveling step, the `gargouillade` almost always involves a change of feet.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nAfter reviewing all the options, the only step that, by its specific definition, requires the dancer to land in the same leg position from which they started is the **Entrechat six**. The other steps either explicitly state a change (`changé`), have different starting and ending positions by nature (`assemblé`), or are types of steps that typically change the feet (`glissade derrière`, `gargouillade`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
