    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question**\n\nThe question asks for the most probable molecular mechanism that explains two outcomes after a gene duplication event:\n*   **Retention:** Both copies of the gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than one copy being deleted or lost to mutation.\n*   **Divergence:** The two gene copies evolve to become different from each other in their DNA sequence and, consequently, their function or regulation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"overwritten\" by another homologous copy, making them identical or more similar. This mechanism works *against* divergence and promotes homogenization. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism for retention *and* divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene. One copy accumulates deleterious mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene.\" While the pseudogene's sequence diverges due to a lack of selective pressure, the gene itself is not *retained* as a functional unit. The process results in the loss of one functional copy, so it doesn't fit the \"retention\" criterion for both copies.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This model explains both **retention** (the original function is preserved, and the new function provides a selective advantage, so both copies are kept) and **divergence** (the second copy must change its sequence to gain the new function). This is a valid and important mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model applies when the original, ancestral gene had multiple functions or was expressed in multiple tissues (i.e., it was pleiotropic). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that inactivate *different* subfunctions. For instance, copy 1 loses the ability to function in the liver but retains function in the brain, while copy 2 loses function in the brain but retains it in the liver. Now, both copies are required to perform the complete set of the original gene's functions. This model provides a strong explanation for **retention** (losing either copy would be disadvantageous) and **divergence** (the copies accumulate different mutations and are selected to specialize in their remaining subfunctions).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism. It describes the rapid diversification of a single lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is not the mechanism that acts on the genes. This choice is at the wrong level of biological organization.\n\n**3. Compare the Most Plausible Options (C vs. D)**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks which is **\"most likely.\"**\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires the occurrence of a rare event: a series of mutations that create a novel, beneficial function. While this is a powerful force for evolutionary innovation, its rarity means it might not be the most common reason duplicates are initially kept.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** relies on a much more common event: random, degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations. Degenerative mutations happen far more frequently than beneficial, gain-of-function mutations. The subfunctionalization model provides a passive route to preservation. As soon as a gene is duplicated, both copies are under relaxed selection, allowing degenerative mutations to accumulate. If these mutations happen to partition the ancestral functions between the two copies, both immediately become essential and are preserved by purifying selection.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause subfunctionalization relies on more frequent mutational events (degeneration) to lock both copies into the genome, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more common and therefore **more likely** initial mechanism for preventing the loss of a duplicate gene. It provides a stable state of retention, which then allows for longer evolutionary time during which one copy might eventually neofunctionalize. Therefore, as a general mechanism for retention and divergence, subfunctionalization is considered highly probable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
