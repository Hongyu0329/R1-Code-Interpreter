    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and its Source:** The question is about the poem \"Sir Launfal.\" This specific version of the story was written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. To know what it was preserved alongside, we must identify the original manuscript where the poem is found.\n2.  **Locate the Manuscript:** The only surviving manuscript containing Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\" is a famous collection known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**. It is currently housed in the British Library.\n3.  **Understand the Nature of the Manuscript:** The Cotton Caligula A.ii is not a single book but a \"miscellany.\" This means it is a collection of many different, often unrelated, texts that were compiled and bound together in one volume by a scribe or patron. Therefore, \"Sir Launfal\" is just one of several works in this collection.\n4.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** To answer the question, we need to look at the table of contents for Cotton Caligula A.ii. This manuscript contains a variety of Middle English romances, saints' lives, and didactic poems.\n5.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** Within the list of the manuscript's contents, there is a specific text that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\" This work is a didactic poem focused on teaching proper conduct, etiquette, and courtly behavior. Its title is **A Boke of Curtasye** (or, in modern English, *The Book of Courtesy*).\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Specificity of \"Sir Launfal\":** It's important to specify Thomas Chestre's version, as there are other related tales (like Marie de France's *Lanval*), but only Chestre's is in this specific manuscript.\n*   **Uniqueness of the Manuscript:** The fact that Cotton Caligula A.ii is the *sole* source for Chestre's poem makes the answer definitive.\n*   **Meaning of \"Curtasye\":** The Middle English word \"curtasye\" translates directly to \"courtesy,\" which is the central theme of a book of manners, especially one from this period which would have focused on courtly life.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing the poem \"Sir Launfal\" to its source manuscript, Cotton Caligula A.ii, and examining the other texts collected within it, we can identify the specific \"book of manners\" it was preserved alongside.\n\n<<<A Boke of Curtasye (The Book of Courtesy)>>>"
