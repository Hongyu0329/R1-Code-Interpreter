    "This question involves understanding the relationship between crystal symmetry (point groups), chirality, polarity, and the physical property of optical activity. Let's break down the requirements step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the properties required by the question.**\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  Have the correct symmetry for **optical activity**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry requirement for Optical Activity.**\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of linearly polarized light as it passes through it.\n*   **Symmetry Condition:** For a crystal to be naturally optically active, its structure must be **chiral**.\n*   **Chirality:** A structure is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In the language of crystallography, a crystal class (point group) is chiral if it **lacks any improper rotation axes**. Improper rotation axes are symmetry operations that convert a right-handed object to a left-handed one. These include:\n    *   A center of inversion (symmbol: ī)\n    *   A mirror plane (symbol: m)\n    *   Rotoinversion axes (e.g., 4̄, 6̄)\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The phrase \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" is a synonym for **\"is chiral\"**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Achiral\" requirement.**\n*   **Achirality:** This is the opposite of chirality. A crystal is achiral if its structure *can* be superimposed on its mirror image.\n*   **Symmetry Condition:** A crystal class is achiral if its point group **contains at least one improper rotation axis** (i.e., a center of inversion or a mirror plane).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the central contradiction.**\nThe question demands that the crystal classes be both:\n*   **Achiral** (meaning they possess a center of inversion or mirror plane).\n*   Have the symmetry for **optical activity** (meaning they are chiral, and thus *lack* a center of inversion or mirror plane).\n\nThese two conditions are mutually exclusive. A crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** If a crystal is achiral, it cannot be optically active.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** If a crystal is optically active, it must be chiral.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The question contains a fundamental contradiction in its premises. It asks to find members of a set that is, by definition, empty.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the \"Non-polar\" requirement (for completeness).**\n*   **Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if it has a unique direction, leading to a net dipole moment. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n*   **Non-polarity:** A crystal class is non-polar if it is not one of the ten polar classes.\n*   **Relevance:** While we can determine which classes are non-polar, this condition cannot be met in conjunction with the other two. Since the set of crystal classes that are both \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" is the empty set, adding the further constraint of \"non-polar\" still results in an empty set.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the principles of crystallography and optics, a material must be chiral to exhibit optical activity. The question asks for crystal classes that are achiral, which by definition means they are not chiral. Therefore, it is impossible for an achiral crystal class to have the correct symmetry for optical activity. The set of such crystal classes is empty.\n\n<<<There are no crystal classes that satisfy these conditions. The requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be chiral, while the question specifies that the crystal class must be achiral. These two conditions are mutually exclusive."
