    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the simplex category $\\Delta$ as a 2-category.**\n\nThe problem states that $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$. Let's break down what this means:\n*   **Objects:** The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n*   **Morphisms (1-morphisms):** For any two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$, a morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map. That is, if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-morphisms:** For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$, denoted $f \\Rightarrow g$, if and only if $f(k) \\le g(k)$ for all $k \\in [m]$. Since for any pair $(f, g)$, there is at most one such 2-morphism (its existence is a yes/no question), the hom-category $\\Delta([m], [n])$ is a partially ordered set (a poset). This is why it's called \"locally posetal\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definition of an internal adjunction in this context.**\n\nAn internal adjunction in a 2-category from an object $A$ to an object $B$ consists of:\n1.  A pair of morphisms: a \"left adjoint\" $L: A \\to B$ and a \"right adjoint\" $R: B \\to A$.\n2.  A pair of 2-morphisms: a \"unit\" $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and a \"counit\" $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$.\n3.  These must satisfy the triangle identities. However, in a locally posetal 2-category, the triangle identities are automatically satisfied if the unit and counit 2-morphisms exist.\n\nApplying this to our specific case, an adjunction from $A = [m] = [23]$ to $B = [n] = [37]$ requires:\n*   An order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n*   An order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n*   A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$. Based on the definition of 2-morphisms in $\\Delta$, this means $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(k) \\le (R \\circ L)(k)$ for all $k \\in [23]$, which simplifies to $k \\le R(L(k))$.\n*   A counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThese two conditions, $k \\le R(L(k))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$, for a pair of order-preserving maps between posets, is precisely the definition of a **Galois connection**.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps.**\n\nA Galois connection is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $L$ or the right adjoint $R$. A map is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins), and a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\n*   **For the left adjoint $L: [m] \\to [n]$:**\n    *   The posets $[k]$ are complete lattices. The join of a set of elements is their maximum. The join of the empty set is the minimum element, 0.\n    *   For $L$ to be a morphism in $\\Delta$, it must be order-preserving. An order-preserving map between totally ordered sets automatically preserves non-empty joins (i.e., $L(\\max(S)) = \\max(L(S))$ for $S \\neq \\emptyset$).\n    *   For $L$ to be a left adjoint, it must also preserve the empty join. This means $L(\\sup(\\emptyset)) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))$. In $[m]$, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$. Since $L(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$, its supremum in $[n]$ is also 0. Thus, the condition is $L(0) = 0$.\n    *   So, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\n*   **For the right adjoint $R: [n] \\to [m]$:**\n    *   Similarly, an order-preserving map is a right adjoint if it preserves the empty meet. The meet of a set of elements is their minimum. The meet of the empty set is the maximum element.\n    *   Thus, we need $R(\\inf(\\emptyset)) = \\inf(R(\\emptyset))$. In $[n]$, $\\inf(\\emptyset) = n$. In $[m]$, $\\inf(R(\\emptyset)) = \\inf(\\emptyset) = m$. So the condition is $R(n)=m$.\n    *   So, we could instead count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37)=23$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of such maps.**\n\nLet's count the number of left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$. We are looking for the number of order-preserving sequences $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ satisfying:\n1.  $L(0) = 0$.\n2.  $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $L(0)$ is fixed, we only need to choose the values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. This is equivalent to choosing a non-decreasing sequence of 23 integers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using \"stars and bars\".\nLet $y_k = L(k)$ for $k=1, \\dots, 23$. We are counting the number of sequences such that $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing 23 items from the set of possible values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $37-0+1 = 38$ values) with replacement. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\nHere, $k=23$ (the number of values we are choosing) and $n=38$ (the number of options for each value).\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\left(\\!\\!{38 \\choose 23}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAlternatively, using a different stars and bars setup:\nLet $x_k = L(k)$. We have the sequence $0 = x_0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le \\dots \\le x_{23} \\le 37$.\nDefine the increments:\n*   $d_1 = x_1 - x_0 = x_1$\n*   $d_2 = x_2 - x_1$\n*   ...\n*   $d_{23} = x_{23} - x_{22}$\n*   $d_{24} = 37 - x_{23}$\n\nEach $d_i$ is a non-negative integer. Their sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{24} d_i = (x_1 - x_0) + (x_2 - x_1) + \\dots + (x_{23} - x_{22}) + (37 - x_{23}) = 37 - x_0 = 37 $$\nSo we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_{24} = 37$.\nThis corresponds to distributing 37 \"stars\" into 24 \"bins\". The number of ways is:\n$$ \\binom{\\text{stars} + \\text{bins} - 1}{\\text{bins} - 1} = \\binom{37 + 24 - 1}{24 - 1} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nEach such map $L$ uniquely determines a corresponding right adjoint $R$ and thus a unique adjunction. Therefore, the number of internal adjunctions is the number of possible left adjoint maps $L$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nWith $m=23$ and $n=37$, the number of adjunctions is given by the general formula $\\binom{n+m}{m}$:\n$$ \\text{Number of adjunctions} = \\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n<<<$ \\binom{60}{23} $>>>"
