    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is a substituted alkene, which acts as a dienophile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, which results in the formation of a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Regioselectivity:**\n    *   The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical.\n    *   The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is unsymmetrical, as the two carbons of the double bond have different substituents (two chlorines vs. two fluorines).\n    *   When an unsymmetrical dienophile reacts with a symmetrical diene, the reaction is regioselective, meaning one of two possible constitutional isomers will be formed as the major product.\n    *   The regioselectivity is determined by the electronic properties of the dienophile. The reaction is governed by Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, where the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene interacts with the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile.\n    *   Bond formation occurs preferentially between the atoms with the largest orbital coefficients. For butadiene's HOMO, the largest coefficients are on the terminal carbons (C1 and C4). For the dienophile's LUMO, the largest coefficient is on the more electron-deficient (electrophilic) carbon atom.\n    *   To determine the more electrophilic carbon in CCl₂=CF₂, we must compare the electron-withdrawing strength of the -CCl₂ and -CF₂ groups. Both chlorine and fluorine are electron-withdrawing through the inductive effect (-I effect). Fluorine is the most electronegative element, so it has a stronger inductive effect than chlorine. Therefore, the -CF₂ group is more strongly electron-withdrawing than the -CCl₂ group.\n    *   This makes the carbon atom bonded to the two fluorine atoms more electron-deficient (more δ⁺) and thus the more electrophilic center. The LUMO will have a larger coefficient on this carbon.\n\n3.  **Predict the Major Product's Structure:**\n    *   Based on the FMO analysis, the terminal carbon of butadiene (C1) will preferentially form a bond with the more electrophilic carbon of the dienophile (the carbon of the CF₂ group).\n    *   Consequently, the other terminal carbon of butadiene (C4) will bond with the other carbon of the dienophile (the carbon of the CCl₂ group).\n    *   This leads to a specific connectivity in the resulting cyclohexene ring. Let's trace the atoms:\n        *   Diene: C1H₂=C2H-C3H=C4H₂\n        *   Dienophile: CαCl₂=CβF₂ (where Cβ is the more electrophilic carbon)\n        *   New bonds: C1-Cβ and C4-Cα.\n        *   New double bond: C2=C3.\n        *   The resulting ring contains the atoms in the sequence: -C2H=C3H-C4H₂-CαCl₂-CβF₂-C1H₂-\n\n4.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The parent structure is a cyclohexene.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the double bond is assigned positions 1 and 2.\n    *   We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. In this case, the substituents are on carbons 4 and 5.\n    *   The structure formed has the -CCl₂ group at position 4 and the -CF₂ group at position 5.\n    *   When naming, substituents are listed in alphabetical order (\"chloro\" before \"fluoro\"). The numbering of the ring is chosen to give the alphabetically preceding group the lower number, if there is a choice.\n    *   The group at position 4 is dichloro. The group at position 5 is difluoro. Since \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\", and it has been assigned the lower number (4), this numbering is correct.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the major product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation Summary:**\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The regiochemistry is controlled by the electronic effects on the unsymmetrical dienophile CCl₂=CF₂. The CF₂ group is more electron-withdrawing than the CCl₂ group, making the carbon atom of the CF₂ group the more electrophilic site. The terminal carbon of butadiene attacks this site, leading to the formation of a specific constitutional isomer. Following IUPAC naming conventions for this structure yields the name 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
