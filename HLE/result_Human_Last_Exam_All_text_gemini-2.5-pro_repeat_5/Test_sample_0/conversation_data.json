    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-level views are a family of theories in population ethics that modify classical utilitarianism. According to critical-level utilitarianism, the value of a population is not the sum of individual utilities, but the sum of individual utilities minus a \"critical level\" (`c`).\n\n*   **Value of a Population = Σ (uᵢ - c)**\n    *   `uᵢ` is the utility (welfare) of individual `i`.\n    *   `c` is the critical level, a positive value (`c > 0`).\n\nThis has a key implication:\n*   Adding a person with utility **above** the critical level (`u > c`) is a good thing (it increases the total value).\n*   Adding a person with utility **below** the critical level (`u < c`), even if their life is worth living (`u > 0`), is a bad thing (it decreases the total value).\n*   Adding a person with utility **exactly at** the critical level (`u = c`) has a neutral effect on the total value.\n\nCritical-level views are specifically designed to avoid the \"Repugnant Conclusion\" of classical utilitarianism, where a massive population of people with barely-worth-living lives is deemed better than a smaller population with very high-quality lives.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Conditions of Arrhenius's Theorem\n\nWe need to examine each condition and see if it is compatible with critical-level views.\n\n**A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle states that a perfectly equal population is better than another population with the same number of people, lower average and total welfare, and a less equal distribution of welfare. Critical-level views are aggregative and generally respect higher total welfare, so they are unlikely to violate this condition.\n\n**B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This principle states that for any number of very happy people, there is some number of people with slightly negative welfare whose existence, if added, would make the outcome worse. Critical-level views satisfy this. Adding people with negative utility (`u < 0`) always results in a utility contribution of `u - c`, which is even more negative, thus always making the outcome worse.\n\n**C. Non-Elitism:** The Non-Elitism condition states that for any high-welfare population, there exists some other population with very low (but still positive) welfare that is better. More formally: For any population A consisting of `n` people at a high utility level `h`, there is some other population B consisting of `m` people at a low positive utility level `l` such that B is better than A.\n\n*   **Let's test this with a critical-level view.**\n    *   Let the critical level be `c = 10`.\n    *   Consider Population A: One person with a high utility level `h = 100`. The value of this population is `(100 - 10) = 90`.\n    *   Consider Population B: `m` people with a low but positive utility level, `l = 2`. For B to be a \"low-welfare\" population in this context, we must have `l < c`.\n    *   The value of Population B is `m * (2 - 10) = -8m`.\n    *   The Non-Elitism condition requires that we can find some number `m` such that Population B is better than Population A. This means we need to find an `m` where `Value(B) > Value(A)`.\n    *   Is it possible that `-8m > 90`? No. Since `m` must be a positive number of people, `-8m` will always be negative, while `90` is positive. A negative value can never be greater than a positive value.\n    *   Therefore, critical-level views **violate** the Non-Elitism condition. They are inherently \"elitist\" in the sense that they create a threshold (`c`) and judge populations of people with welfare below that threshold as having negative value, making them unable to ever outweigh populations with welfare above the threshold.\n\n**D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This principle states that, other things being equal, adding a person with positive welfare is never worse than adding a person with negative welfare.\n\n*   **Let's test this with a critical-level view.**\n    *   Value of adding a person with positive utility `u_pos > 0`: `u_pos - c`.\n    *   Value of adding a person with negative utility `u_neg < 0`: `u_neg - c`.\n    *   The condition requires `(u_pos - c) ≥ (u_neg - c)`. This simplifies to `u_pos ≥ u_neg`.\n    *   Since `u_pos` is positive and `u_neg` is negative, this inequality is always true.\n    *   Therefore, critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n**E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that it is possible for adding people with positive welfare to be a good thing. More formally: there exists at least one population with positive welfare which is better than an empty population.\n\n*   **Let's test this with a critical-level view.**\n    *   The value of an empty population is 0.\n    *   Consider adding one person with utility `u`. The value is `u - c`.\n    *   For this to be better than an empty population, we need `u - c > 0`, which means `u > c`.\n    *   As long as it is possible for people to have lives with welfare greater than the critical level `c`, this condition is met. Any plausible version of a critical-level view allows for this.\n    *   Therefore, critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Quality Addition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that critical-level views satisfy all the listed conditions except for one. The very structure of critical-level views, which evaluates additions of people relative to a positive critical level `c`, puts them in direct conflict with the Non-Elitism condition, which requires that a sufficiently large quantity of low-quality lives can always outweigh a finite quantity of high-quality lives.\n\n<<<C>>>"
