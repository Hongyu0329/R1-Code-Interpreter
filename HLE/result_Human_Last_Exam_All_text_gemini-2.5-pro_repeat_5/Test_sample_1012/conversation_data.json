    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Threat Model\nThe question specifies the adversary has an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\" This means we need to consider the most effective known quantum algorithms for breaking cryptographic systems. For symmetric key cryptography, the primary threat is a brute-force search for the key.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Classical vs. Quantum Brute-Force Attacks\n*   **Classical Computer:** A classical computer must try, on average, half of all possible keys to find the correct one. For a key of length *n* bits, there are 2^n possible keys. The computational effort (or security level) is therefore proportional to 2^n. For a 128-bit key, this is 2^128 operations, which is considered computationally infeasible.\n*   **Quantum Computer:** A quantum computer can use **Grover's algorithm** to perform a brute-force search much more efficiently. Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical search. Instead of 2^n operations, it requires approximately sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2) operations.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Effect of the Quantum Threat\nBecause Grover's algorithm reduces the number of operations from 2^n to 2^(n/2), it effectively halves the security level in bits.\n*   A symmetric key of length *n* provides *n* bits of security against a classical computer.\n*   The same key provides only *n/2* bits of security against a quantum computer.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Required Security Level for Post-Quantum Cryptography\nThe generally accepted minimum security level for long-term data protection, even against powerful adversaries, is **128 bits**. This means an attacker would need to perform a number of operations on the order of 2^128, which is considered intractable for the foreseeable future, even with quantum computers.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Minimum Key Length\nTo achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, we need to find the key length *n* that satisfies the following equation:\n\n(Quantum Security Level) = (Key Length *n*) / 2 >= 128 bits\n\nSolving for *n*:\n*n* >= 128 * 2\n*n* >= 256 bits\n\nTherefore, to maintain a 128-bit security level against an attack by a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n1.  **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Keys:** The question is specifically about symmetric keys (like AES). The threat to asymmetric keys (like RSA) from quantum computers is much more severe due to Shor's algorithm, which would require much larger keys (e.g., 3072-bit RSA is broken by Shor's but is only equivalent to ~128-bit symmetric security classically).\n2.  **Grover's Algorithm is the Key:** The quadratic speedup of Grover's is the reason for the \"halving of the bit strength.\"\n3.  **Target Security Level:** The standard benchmark for \"secure\" is 128 bits of computational work. A system with less than this (e.g., 64 bits, which is 2^64 operations) is considered breakable.\n4.  **Minimum Length:** The question asks for the *minimum* length. While 512-bit keys would also be secure (providing 256 bits of quantum security), 256 bits is the minimum required to meet the 128-bit security threshold.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   A 128-bit key provides 128/2 = 64 bits of security against a quantum computer. This is **not secure**.\n*   A 256-bit key provides 256/2 = 128 bits of security against a quantum computer. This **is secure**.\n*   Therefore, the minimum required length is 256 bits.\n\n<<<A>>>"
