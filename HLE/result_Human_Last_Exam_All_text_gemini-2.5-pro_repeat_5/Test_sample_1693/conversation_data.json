    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nFirst, let's break down the key components of the question to ensure all conditions are met:\n*   **Vessel Type:** Any French ship (naval or merchant).\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Must be sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Time Frame:** Between the start of World War II (September 1, 1939) and the Franco-German Armistice (signed on June 22, 1940).\n*   **Metric for \"Largest\":** By displacement. For merchant ships, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is the standard measure of size (internal volume), which serves as the common metric for comparison. For warships, displacement tonnage is used. In this context, we will look for the vessel with the highest tonnage figure.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls\n1.  **Defining \"Sunk by a U-boat\":** This is a critical point. Does it only include direct torpedo or gun attacks, or does it also include sinkings caused by mines laid by a U-boat? Historically, sinkings by U-boat-laid mines are credited as U-boat victories. We must consider both.\n2.  **Time Frame Accuracy:** Events happening just after the armistice (e.g., the British attack on Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940) must be excluded. The cutoff date is June 22, 1940.\n3.  **Comparing Tonnage:** Merchant ship GRT and warship displacement tons are different measures, but for a question of finding the \"largest,\" we are typically looking for the vessel with the highest numerical tonnage value, which will almost certainly be a large passenger liner or tanker rather than a warship from that era.\n4.  **Verification:** Information must be cross-referenced with reliable naval history sources (like uboat.net, naval encyclopedias, and shipwreck databases) to confirm the ship's name, tonnage, date of sinking, and cause.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis and Research\n1.  **Initial Search:** We will search for a list of all French ships sunk between September 1939 and June 22, 1940, and filter for those sunk by U-boats.\n\n2.  **Identify Candidates (Naval Vessels):** Let's check for major French warships sunk in this period by U-boats.\n    *   No French battleships, battlecruisers, or cruisers were sunk by U-boats during this time.\n    *   The largest destroyer (contre-torpilleur) lost involving a U-boat was the **`Bison`** (2,436 tons displacement). It was crippled by a torpedo from U-25 on May 3, 1940, but was ultimately sunk by German aircraft. This makes its classification as \"sunk by a U-boat\" ambiguous, and its tonnage is relatively small.\n    *   The submarine **`Doris`** (630 tons displacement) was sunk by U-9 on May 9, 1940.\n    *   From this, it's clear the largest vessel will not be a warship but a merchant vessel.\n\n3.  **Identify Candidates (Merchant Vessels):** We search for large French merchant ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period. Two main candidates emerge:\n    *   **`Emile Miguet`**: A large French oil tanker.\n        *   **Tonnage:** 14,115 GRT.\n        *   **Date Sunk:** October 12, 1939.\n        *   **Cause:** Sunk by torpedoes from the U-boat `U-48`.\n        *   This is a very large ship and a strong early candidate.\n\n    *   **SS `Champlain`**: A prominent French passenger liner for the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique.\n        *   **Tonnage:** 28,124 GRT.\n        *   **Date Sunk:** June 17, 1940. (This is five days before the armistice, so it falls within the time frame).\n        *   **Cause:** Struck a mine laid by the German U-boat `U-103` off La Pallice, France. The ship was severely damaged and sank over the following days.\n        *   This sinking is directly attributable to a U-boat's offensive action.\n\n4.  **Compare the Candidates and Conclude:**\n    *   The passenger liner **SS `Champlain`** had a Gross Register Tonnage of **28,124 GRT**.\n    *   The tanker **`Emile Miguet`** had a Gross Register Tonnage of **14,115 GRT**.\n    *   The largest warship candidate, `Bison`, was only 2,436 tons.\n\n    Comparing the tonnage values, the SS `Champlain` is significantly larger than any other French vessel sunk by a U-boat (either by direct attack or by a U-boat-laid mine) before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nThe largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the passenger liner SS `Champlain`.\n\n<<<SS Champlain>>>"
