    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the given hypothesis class.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Domain (X):** A set of points of size $|X| = T$.\n*   **Hypothesis Class (H_{z-ones}):** This is a set of functions, where each function $h: X \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ has a specific property.\n*   **Constraint:** For any function $h$ in the class $H_{z-ones}$, the number of points it labels as '1' is exactly $z$. That is, $|\\{x \\in X : h(x) = 1\\}| = z$.\n*   **Goal:** Determine the VC dimension of $H_{z-ones}$ in terms of $z$ and $T$.\n\n### 2. Recalling the Definition of VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a hypothesis class $H$ is the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be **shattered** by $H$. A set $S$ of size $d$ is shattered if for every one of the $2^d$ possible ways to label the points in $S$ with {0, 1}, there is a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that produces that exact labeling.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's find the maximum size $d$ of a set $S \\subseteq X$ that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. Let $|S|=d$.\n\nTo shatter $S$, we must be able to generate any labeling of the $d$ points in $S$. Let's consider an arbitrary labeling on $S$. Suppose this labeling assigns '1' to $k$ points in $S$ and '0' to the other $d-k$ points. Here, $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $d$.\n\nFor this labeling to be achievable by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, we must be able to define $h$ such that:\n1.  $h(x)$ matches the given labeling for all $x \\in S$.\n2.  The total number of points labeled '1' by $h$ over the entire domain $X$ is exactly $z$.\n\nFrom the first point, our hypothesis $h$ must label $k$ points in $S$ as '1'. To satisfy the second point, $h$ must therefore label an additional $z-k$ points as '1' from the set of points outside of $S$, which is $X \\setminus S$.\n\nFor this to be possible for **any** arbitrary labeling on $S$, the following two conditions must hold for **all** possible values of $k$ (from $k=0$ to $k=d$):\n\n**Condition 1: We must have enough '1's to assign.**\nThe number of '1's required for the points outside $S$ must be non-negative.\n$z - k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$.\nThis must hold for all possible $k$ in $\\{0, 1, ..., d\\}$. The most restrictive case is for the largest value of $k$, which is $k=d$.\nSo, we must have $d \\le z$.\n\n**Condition 2: We must have enough points outside S to choose from.**\nThe number of '1's we need to assign to points in $X \\setminus S$ (which is $z-k$) cannot be more than the number of available points in $X \\setminus S$. The number of points in $X \\setminus S$ is $|X| - |S| = T - d$.\nSo, we must have $z - k \\le T - d$.\nThis must also hold for all possible $k$ in $\\{0, 1, ..., d\\}$. The most restrictive case is for the smallest value of $k$, which is $k=0$.\nFor $k=0$, the condition becomes $z \\le T - d$, which can be rewritten as $d \\le T - z$.\n\n**Combining the Conditions:**\nFor a set of size $d$ to be shattered, both conditions must be met. Therefore, we need:\n$d \\le z$ AND $d \\le T - z$.\nThis is equivalent to saying $d \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nThis establishes an **upper bound** on the VC dimension: $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### 4. Proving the Bound is Achievable (Lower Bound)\n\nNow we need to show that we can actually shatter a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$. Let's pick any set $S$ with $|S|=d$.\nConsider any labeling of $S$, with $k$ points labeled '1' (where $0 \\le k \\le d$). We need to show that we can always find an $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that produces this labeling.\n\nThis means we need to label $k$ points in $S$ as '1' and $z-k$ points in $X \\setminus S$ as '1'.\nLet's check if this is always possible for $d = \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n1.  **Is $z-k \\ge 0$?**\n    We know $k \\le d$. Since $d = \\min(z, T-z)$, it is guaranteed that $d \\le z$. Therefore, $k \\le d \\le z$, which means $k \\le z$, and $z-k \\ge 0$. This is always possible.\n\n2.  **Is $z-k \\le |X \\setminus S|$?**\n    The size of $X \\setminus S$ is $T-d$. So we need to check if $z-k \\le T-d$. This is equivalent to $d+k \\le T+z$ or $d-z \\le k$. Rearranging, we need $k \\ge z-(T-d)$.\n    We need this to hold for all $k \\in \\{0, ..., d\\}$. The hardest case is $k=0$, so we must check if $0 \\ge z-(T-d)$, which is $T-d \\ge z$, or $d \\le T-z$.\n    Since $d = \\min(z, T-z)$, it is guaranteed that $d \\le T-z$. This condition is also always met.\n\nSince both conditions are met for any choice of $k$ (i.e., for any labeling), we can always construct the required hypothesis $h$. Thus, any set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\n\nThis establishes the **lower bound**: $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\n\nFrom our analysis, we have:\n*   $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n*   $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nA careful point to note is the case where $z=T$ or $z=0$.\n*   If $z=T$, every point must be labeled 1. There is only one hypothesis. $VC = \\min(T, T-T) = \\min(T, 0) = 0$. This is correct, as a class with one hypothesis cannot even shatter a single point (it cannot produce both the '0' and '1' labelings).\n*   If $z=0$, every point must be labeled 0. Again, only one hypothesis. $VC = \\min(0, T-0) = 0$. Correct.\nOur formula holds even for these edge cases (though the problem states $z$ is a positive integer).\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
