    "Answering this question requires understanding the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), which is the technique described. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n*   **Spectral Volume**: This is a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). For each spatial point (x, y) in a scene, we want to know its full spectrum, `f(x, y, λ)`.\n*   **Single Image**: All the information needed must be captured in one snapshot on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor). This detector records a 2D intensity pattern, let's say `g(u, v)`.\n*   **Computed Tomography (CT)**: This is the specified reconstruction method. CT reconstructs a volume from a set of its projections. In our case, the 2D image `g(u, v)` must contain the necessary \"projections\" of the 3D spectral volume `f(x, y, λ)`.\n*   **Diffraction Gratings**: These are the optical elements used to create the projections by dispersing light according to its wavelength.\n\n### Step 2: How CTIS Works\nIn CTIS, a disperser (the grating) is placed in the optical path. Light from the scene `f(x, y, λ)` is projected onto the 2D detector. The grating splits the light into multiple diffraction orders. Each diffraction order creates a separate, spectrally dispersed image of the scene on the detector. These images all overlap to form the final single image `g(u, v)`.\n\nThe recorded image `g(u, v)` is a superposition of all these dispersed images. The CT reconstruction algorithm then takes this multiplexed 2D image and computationally reconstructs the original 3D data cube.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Minimum Requirement\nThe core of computed tomography is that to reconstruct an N-dimensional object, you need a set of (N-1)-dimensional projections taken from various angles. Here, we are reconstructing a 3D object `f(x, y, λ)`.\n\n*   **Consider using one 1D diffraction grating:** A standard 1D grating disperses light along a single axis. Let's say we align it to disperse along the x-direction. A point `(x, y)` in the scene will be spread into a line of colors on the detector, parallel to the u-axis. The y-coordinate is not affected by the dispersion (`v = y`). The u-coordinate becomes a function of both the original position `x` and the wavelength `λ` (e.g., `u ≈ x + cλ`, where `c` is a constant depending on the diffraction order).\n\n    *   **The Problem**: For any given `y` slice, this system only provides information that mixes `x` and `λ`. It provides no information that mixes `y` and `λ`. While the multiple diffraction orders of the 1D grating do provide multiple projections of the `(x, λ)` plane, these projections are all taken at a very limited range of angles. This is a classic \"limited-angle tomography\" problem. It results in a \"missing cone\" in the 3D Fourier space of the data cube, making the reconstruction problem ill-posed. A \"full spectral volume\" cannot be accurately reconstructed because there is fundamental missing information. Therefore, a single 1D grating is insufficient.\n\n*   **Consider using two dispersion axes:** To overcome the limitations of a 1D grating, we need to introduce dispersion along a second, non-collinear direction. Typically, an orthogonal axis is used. This means we need one grating function to disperse along `x` (mixing `x` and `λ`) and a second grating function to disperse along `y` (mixing `y` and `λ`).\n\n    *   **The Solution**: With two dispersion axes, the system now creates projections along multiple different directions in the 3D `(x, y, λ)` space. For example, some diffraction orders mix `x` and `λ`, others mix `y` and `λ`, and still others (the diagonal orders) mix `x`, `y`, and `λ`. This rich set of projections allows for a much more complete sampling of the data cube's Fourier space, making the tomographic reconstruction problem well-posed and enabling the recovery of a \"full spectral volume\".\n\n### Step 4: Relate to the Number of Gratings\nWe have established that two fundamental dispersion functions (or axes) are necessary. How can this be implemented?\n1.  **Using two separate 1D gratings**: One can place two 1D gratings in the optical path, with their grating lines oriented perpendicularly to each other. This physically uses **two** gratings.\n2.  **Using one 2D diffraction grating**: A 2D grating is a single optical component that has a periodic pattern in two dimensions. Functionally, it is equivalent to two crossed 1D gratings. It produces a 2D array of diffraction orders, providing the necessary dispersion along two independent axes.\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of diffraction gratings\". This can be interpreted in two ways:\n*   As the minimum number of physical components. In this case, the answer would be 1, since a single 2D grating works.\n*   As the minimum number of fundamental grating functions required for the physics to work. As we determined, one grating function is insufficient, while two are sufficient. In this sense, the answer is 2.\n\nIn physics and engineering questions of this nature, the query usually points towards the fundamental requirement of the principle being tested. The fundamental principle of CTIS is that the tomographic inversion requires projections from more than one dispersion axis. The minimum number of axes to make the problem well-posed is two. Therefore, the question is most likely asking for this fundamental number.\n\n### Conclusion\nA single dispersion axis (from one 1D grating) is not enough. A minimum of two dispersion axes are necessary to uniquely reconstruct the 3D spectral volume without fundamental ambiguities. Thus, two grating functions are required.\n\n<<<B>>>"
