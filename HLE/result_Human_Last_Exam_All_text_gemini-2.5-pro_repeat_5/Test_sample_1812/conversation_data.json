    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the components of the question**\n\nThe question asks for the determinant of a matrix referred to as \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\(m_{1/2} = 13\\)\". We are also given a matrix \\(A\\):\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe phrasing suggests that the matrix whose determinant we need to find is not simply \\(A\\) itself, but a matrix derived from \\(A\\) and the parameter \\(m = 13\\). If the question were to compute the determinant of \\(A\\), the information about \\(m_{1/2} = 13\\) would be irrelevant. In contest-style problems, all information is typically relevant.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the given matrix A**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of matrix \\(A\\).\n*   **Symmetry:** The matrix \\(A\\) is symmetric, as \\(A = A^T\\).\n*   **Singularity:** Let's check if the matrix is singular. A simple way is to sum the rows or columns.\n    *   Sum of Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Sum of Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Sum of Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n    Since the sum of each row is 0, the vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) is in the null space of \\(A\\). This means that \\(\\lambda=0\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A\\).\n*   **Determinant of A:** A matrix with an eigenvalue of 0 is singular, which means its determinant is 0.\n    We can also compute it directly:\n    \\(\\det(A) = 2(2 \\cdot 2 - (-1)(-1)) - (-1)((-1) \\cdot 2 - (-1)(-1)) + (-1)((-1)(-1) - 2(-1))\\)\n    \\(\\det(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)\\)\n    \\(\\det(A) = 2(3) - 3 - 3 = 6 - 6 = 0\\).\n\n**Step 3: Hypothesize the target matrix**\n\nSince \\(\\det(A) = 0\\) and this calculation ignores the parameter \\(m=13\\), we must assume the matrix in question, let's call it \\(M\\), is constructed from \\(A\\) and \\(m\\). A very common construction in linear algebra and physics (e.g., for resolvent operators or characteristic polynomials) is of the form \\(mI - A\\). Let's assume this is the intended matrix. The name \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\(m_{1/2} = 13\\)\" is likely a specific convention used in the field from which the problem originates. The subscript `1/2` on `m` does not alter the value to be used, which is 13.\n\nSo, our hypothesis is that we need to compute the determinant of \\(M = 13I - A\\).\n\n**Step 4: Compute the determinant of the hypothesized matrix M**\n\nLet's construct the matrix \\(M\\):\n\\[\nM = 13I - A = 13\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 13-2 & 0-(-1) & 0-(-1) \\\\ 0-(-1) & 13-2 & 0-(-1) \\\\ 0-(-1) & 0-(-1) & 13-2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 11 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 11 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 11 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nNow, let's compute the determinant of \\(M\\):\n\\(\\det(M) = 11(11 \\cdot 11 - 1 \\cdot 1) - 1(1 \\cdot 11 - 1 \\cdot 1) + 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 11 \\cdot 1)\\)\n\\(\\det(M) = 11(121 - 1) - 1(11 - 1) + 1(1 - 11)\\)\n\\(\\det(M) = 11(120) - 1(10) - 10\\)\n\\(\\det(M) = 1320 - 10 - 10\\)\n\\(\\det(M) = 1300\\)\n\n**Step 5: Verify the result using eigenvalues (Alternative Method)**\n\nThis provides a good check on the result.\n1.  **Find the eigenvalues of A.** The characteristic polynomial is \\(\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0\\).\n    \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2-\\lambda & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2-\\lambda & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = -\\lambda(\\lambda - 3)^2 = 0 \\)\n    The eigenvalues of A are \\(\\lambda_1 = 0\\), \\(\\lambda_2 = 3\\), \\(\\lambda_3 = 3\\).\n2.  **Find the eigenvalues of M.** If \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A\\), then \\(m - \\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(M = mI - A\\).\n    With \\(m=13\\), the eigenvalues of \\(M\\) are:\n    *   \\(13 - \\lambda_1 = 13 - 0 = 13\\)\n    *   \\(13 - \\lambda_2 = 13 - 3 = 10\\)\n    *   \\(13 - \\lambda_3 = 13 - 3 = 10\\)\n3.  **Compute the determinant of M.** The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues.\n    \\(\\det(M) = 13 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1300\\).\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe problem requires computing the determinant of a matrix \\(M\\) which is constructed from the given matrix \\(A\\) and the parameter \\(m=13\\). The most reasonable construction is \\(M = 13I - A\\). The determinant of this matrix is 1300.\n\n<<<1300>>>"
