    "An analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Set (G):** A collection of distinct elements. The number of elements is denoted by `n`, also called the order of the set.\n*   **Binary Operation (·):** A rule that takes any two elements `a` and `b` from the set `G` and produces a result, `a · b`. By definition, a binary operation on a set `G` must be **closed**, meaning the result `a · b` is always also an element of `G`.\n*   **Group (G, ·):** A set `G` with a binary operation `·` that must satisfy the following four axioms:\n    1.  **Closure:** For any `a, b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. (This is guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation on `G`).\n    2.  **Associativity:** For any `a, b, c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds true.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** There exists a unique element `e` in `G` such that for any `a` in `G`, `a · e = e · a = a`.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `a⁻¹` in `G` such that `a · a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest number `n` (the size of the set `G`) for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is **not** a group. This means we are looking for the smallest `n` where we can construct a system that violates at least one of the axioms of associativity, identity, or inverse.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of `n`**\n\nWe will start with the smallest possible non-negative integers for `n`. In group theory, it is standard to consider non-empty sets, so we will start with `n=1`.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   Let the set be `G = {e}`. There is only one element.\n    *   Let's define a binary operation `·` on `G`. Since the set has only one element, there is only one possible operation: `e · e = e`.\n    *   Now, let's check if `(G, ·)` is a group:\n        1.  **Closure:** The only possible operation `e · e` results in `e`, which is in `G`. The axiom holds.\n        2.  **Associativity:** The only possible equation is `(e · e) · e = e · (e · e)`. This simplifies to `e · e = e · e`, or `e = e`. The axiom holds.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element (let's call it `i`) such that `i · a = a · i = a` for all `a` in `G`. The only element `a` is `e`. If we choose `i = e`, then `e · e = e`. So, `e` is the identity element. The axiom holds.\n        4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element, we need an inverse. The only element is `e`. Its inverse must satisfy `e · e⁻¹ = e`. Since `e · e = e`, the inverse of `e` is `e` itself. The axiom holds.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** All group axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element and a binary operation must be a group (this is called the trivial group). Therefore, `n` cannot be 1.\n\n*   **Case n = 2:**\n    *   Let the set be `G = {a, b}`.\n    *   We need to determine if we can define a binary operation `·` on `G` that fails to satisfy at least one of the group axioms (associativity, identity, or inverse). We only need to find one such example.\n    *   Let's try to construct an operation that **fails the identity element axiom**. To do this, we need to ensure that no element in `G` acts as an identity.\n    *   Consider the following operation defined by a multiplication table:\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | a |\n| b | b | b |\n    *   Let's check for an identity element `e`:\n        *   Could `e = a`? For `a` to be the identity, we need `a · x = x` for all `x` in `G`. Let's check `x=b`. The table shows `a · b = a`, but we would need `a · b = b`. So, `a` is not the identity element.\n        *   Could `e = b`? For `b` to be the identity, we need `b · x = x` for all `x` in `G`. Let's check `x=a`. The table shows `b · a = b`, but we would need `b · a = a`. So, `b` is not the identity element.\n    *   Since neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element, this structure `(G, ·)` has no identity element.\n    *   Because it lacks an identity element, `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=2:** We have successfully constructed a set of size 2 with a binary operation that does not form a group.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that for `n=1`, any structure `(G, ·)` must be a group. We have also shown that for `n=2`, it is possible to define a structure `(G, ·)` that is not a group. Therefore, the smallest number `n` for which this is possible is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
