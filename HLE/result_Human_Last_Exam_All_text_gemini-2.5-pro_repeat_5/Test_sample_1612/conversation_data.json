    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\" in Baseball\nA crucial first step is to understand that there are two different types of Triple Crowns in Major League Baseball: one for batting and one for pitching. The question does not specify which one, so we must consider both to provide a complete answer.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in all three of the following categories in the same season:\n    1.  Batting Average\n    2.  Home Runs\n    3.  Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their respective league in all three of the following categories in the same season:\n    1.  Wins\n    2.  Strikeouts\n    3.  Earned Run Average (ERA)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nWe will list the unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n\n**Careful Point:** Some players have won the award more than once (e.g., Ted Williams, Rogers Hornsby). The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which implies counting each player only once.\n\n**American League Batting Winners (9 players):**\n1.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n2.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n3.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n4.  Lou Gehrig (1934)\n5.  Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n6.  Mickey Mantle (1956)\n7.  Frank Robinson (1966)\n8.  Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n9.  Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\n**National League Batting Winners (6 players):**\n1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n2.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n3.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n4.  Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n5.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n6.  Joe Medwick (1937)\n\n**Total unique batting Triple Crown winners = 9 (AL) + 6 (NL) = 15 players.**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown Winners\nNext, we will list the unique players who have achieved the pitching Triple Crown.\n\n**Careful Point:** Similar to the batting award, several pitchers have won it multiple times (e.g., Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax). We will count each pitcher only once. Another point is that Shane Bieber's 2020 win came in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is officially recognized.\n\n**American League Pitching Winners (9 players):**\n1.  Cy Young (1901)\n2.  Rube Waddell (1905)\n3.  Walter Johnson (1913, 1918, 1924)\n4.  Lefty Grove (1930, 1931)\n5.  Lefty Gomez (1934, 1937)\n6.  Hal Newhouser (1945)\n7.  Justin Verlander (2011)\n8.  Shane Bieber (2020)\n9.  Gerrit Cole (2023)\n\n**National League Pitching Winners (11 players):**\n1.  Tommy Bond (1877)\n2.  Amos Rusie (1894)\n3.  Christy Mathewson (1905, 1908)\n4.  Grover Cleveland Alexander (1915, 1916, 1920)\n5.  Dazzy Vance (1924)\n6.  Sandy Koufax (1963, 1965, 1966)\n7.  Steve Carlton (1972)\n8.  Dwight Gooden (1985)\n9.  Randy Johnson (2002)\n10. Jake Peavy (2007)\n11. Clayton Kershaw (2011)\n\n**Total unique pitching Triple Crown winners = 9 (AL) + 11 (NL) = 20 players.**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Total\nTo find the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB, we simply add the number of unique batting winners and unique pitching winners.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must ensure there is no overlapâ€”that is, no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. A review of the lists confirms that no player appears on both lists.\n\n*   Total Unique Batting Winners: 15\n*   Total Unique Pitching Winners: 20\n*   **Total MLB Triple Crown Winners = 15 + 20 = 35**\n\n<<<35>>>"
