    "This is a step-by-step scansion of the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n**Step 1: Syllable Count and Meter Identification**\nFirst, we syllabify the line and count the syllables, being careful not to assume any elisions initially.\net (1) + ti-bi (2) + be-ne (2) + es-se (2) + so-li (2) + quom (1) + si-bi (2) + sit (1) + ma-le (2) = 15 syllables.\nA standard Iambic Senarius has 12 syllables. A 15-syllable line in Plautine comedy is almost certainly a **Trochaic Septenarius Catalectic**. This meter consists of seven trochaic feet (L S) followed by a final, single (catalectic) syllable. It has a major caesura (pause) after the fourth foot.\n\n**Step 2: Determining Syllable Quantities**\nWe determine whether each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on standard rules:\n*   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong.\n*   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants or a double consonant (x, z).\n*   Otherwise, a syllable is short.\n*   The final syllable of a line is *anceps* (can be treated as L or S) but we mark its natural length.\n\n1.  **et**: The vowel 'e' is followed by 't' and the 't' of the next word (`tibi`). It is long by position. -> **L**\n2.  **tibi**: `ti-` is short. `-bi` is short. -> **S S**\n3.  **bene**: `be-` is short. `-ne` is short. -> **S S**\n4.  **esse**: `es-` is long by position (followed by `ss`). `-se` is short. -> **L S**\n5.  **soli**: In the dative of *solus*, both the 'o' and the final 'i' are long by nature. -> **L L**\n6.  **quom**: An archaic form of *cum*. It is a long syllable. -> **L**\n7.  **sibi**: `si-` is short. `-bi` is short. -> **S S**\n8.  **sit**: The 'i' is naturally short, but it is followed by 't' and the 'm' of the next word (`male`). It is long by position. -> **L**\n9.  **male**: `ma-` is short. `-le` is short. -> **S S**\n\nThe full sequence of quantities is: **L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S**\n\n**Step 3: Division into Metrical Feet**\nNow we divide this sequence into the feet of a Trochaic Septenarius (base pattern: L S). Plautine meter allows for substitutions: a spondee (L L), a tribrach (S S S), or a dactyl (L S S) can replace a trochee (L S).\n\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti` -> **L S** (a perfect trochee).\n*   **Foot 2**: `bi be ne` -> **S S S** (a tribrach, which is a valid resolution of a trochee).\n*   **Foot 3**: `es se` -> **L S** (a perfect trochee).\n*   **Foot 4**: `so li` -> **L L** (a spondee, a valid substitution). The caesura falls here.\n*   **Foot 5**: `quom si bi` -> **L S S** (a dactyl, a valid substitution).\n*   **Foot 6**: `sit ma` -> **L S** (a perfect trochee).\n*   **Foot 7**: `le` -> **S** (the final catalectic syllable, completing the line).\n\n**Final Analysis Summary:**\nThe line is a Trochaic Septenarius Catalectic. The scansion proceeds with standard substitutions and resolutions common in Plautus.\n\n*   `et ti | bi be ne | es se | so li || quom si bi | sit ma | le`\n*   L S | S S S | L S | L L || L S S | L S | S\n\nThe analysis is consistent and follows the rules of Plautine meter.\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
