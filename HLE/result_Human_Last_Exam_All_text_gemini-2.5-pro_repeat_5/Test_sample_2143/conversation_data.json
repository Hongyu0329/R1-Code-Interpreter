    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a person (\"HE\") based on an interpretation of \"HIS work\" by \"Veronika Campan\".\n    *   **Clue 1: The Work's Content:** At the end of the work, it \"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"\n    *   **Clue 2: The Method:** This was done by \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"\n    *   **Clue 3: The Interpreter:** The interpretation is attributed to Veronika Campan.\n    *   **Clue 4: The Subject:** We need to find the full name of \"HE\", the author or central figure associated with this work.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **\"The prohibition against representation\":** This is a very strong clue pointing directly to the Second Commandment in the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments), which forbids the making and worship of graven images or idols. This establishes the work in question as the Ten Commandments.\n    *   **\"At the end of HIS work\":** The Ten Commandments are a list of ten. The \"end of the work\" would be the last commandment.\n    *   **\"Addressed the issue of another's material possessions\":** The Tenth Commandment is: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This directly forbids desiring (\"coveting\") another person's possessions and household. This matches the clue perfectly.\n    *   **\"Naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\":** This is the most complex part. The Second Commandment forbids making a *physical* representation (an idol). The Tenth Commandment forbids *coveting*, which is a mental act. In order to covet something (your neighbor's ox, for instance), you must first create a *mental image* or *representation* of that ox in your mind. Therefore, the law shifts its focus from forbidding external, physical images to regulating internal, mental images and the desires attached to them. By legislating on a thought (coveting) that requires a mental representation, the law implicitly acknowledges the existence of these representations, thereby \"naturally ignoring\" the earlier, stricter prohibition on physical ones. This psychoanalytic interpretation (as suggested by the reference to Campan) highlights the shift from regulating actions to regulating internal desire.\n\n3.  **Identify \"HE\":**\n    *   The work is the Ten Commandments.\n    *   According to the narratives in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), the Ten Commandments were given by God to the prophet who led the Israelites out of Egypt.\n    *   This prophet, who received the stone tablets on Mount Sinai and delivered the law to the people, is **Moses**. He is the central human figure to whom the delivery and transcription of this work are attributed.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Work:** The phrasing \"prohibition against representation\" is the key to identifying the work as the Ten Commandments.\n*   **The Specific Commandment:** The combination of being at the \"end\" of the work and dealing with \"material possessions\" points specifically to the Tenth Commandment.\n*   **The Interpretation:** The logic of connecting the prohibition of coveting (a mental act) to mental \"representation\" is the core of the interpretation. You don't need to be an expert in Veronika Campan's work to follow the logic presented in the clue.\n*   **The Identity of \"HE\":** While God is the ultimate author of the commandments in theology, Moses is the human prophet who received, carried, and taught them. In the context of \"HIS work,\" Moses is the intended historical/biblical figure.\n*   **Full Name:** For ancient figures like this, the single given name is typically considered their \"full name\".\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBy systematically analyzing the clues, we have determined:\n1.  The work is the Ten Commandments.\n2.  The specific part of the work is the Tenth Commandment.\n3.  The interpretation describes the shift from forbidding physical images to regulating the mental images involved in desire.\n4.  The person who delivered this work to the people was the prophet Moses.\n\nTherefore, \"HE\" is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
