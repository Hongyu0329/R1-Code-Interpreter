    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Artist**: The artist in question is Elizabeth Southerden Butler, née Thompson (1846–1933), known as Lady Butler. She was a renowned British painter of military and historical scenes.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Task**: The question asks for the *latest historical event* (a battle) that she depicted, not the date she painted the work. We must find the dates of the battles themselves.\n\n3.  **List Major Paintings and the Battles Depicted**: We will compile a list of Lady Butler's notable works that depict specific battles and identify the year each battle took place.\n\n    *   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the **Battle of Quatre Bras**, which took place on **June 16, 1815**.\n    *   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo**, which took place on **June 18, 1815**.\n    *   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts the aftermath of the **Battle of Inkerman** during the Crimean War. The battle took place on **November 5, 1854**.\n    *   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade during the **Battle of Balaclava**. This battle took place on **October 25, 1854**.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** during the Anglo-Zulu War. This battle occurred on **January 22-23, 1879**.\n    *   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1898): Depicts an incident at the **Battle of Laing's Nek** during the First Boer War. This battle took place on **January 28, 1881**.\n    *   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Depicts the **Battle of Tel El Kebir** during the Anglo-Egyptian War, which took place on **September 13, 1882**.\n    *   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1893): Depicts the Nile Expedition, which included the **Battle of Abu Klea** on **January 17, 1885**.\n    *   ***The Charge of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers at Mons*** (sketch, 1915): Depicts a charge during the **Battle of Mons**, one of the first engagements of the British Expeditionary Force in World War I. The battle took place on **August 23, 1914**.\n    *   ***A German Retreat from the Somme*** (sketch, 1917): Depicts a scene from the **Battle of the Somme**. This major World War I battle took place from **July to November 1916**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Dates of the Battles**: Now, we arrange the battles in chronological order to find the latest one.\n\n    *   Battle of Quatre Bras: **1815**\n    *   Battle of Waterloo: **1815**\n    *   Battle of Balaclava: **1854**\n    *   Battle of Inkerman: **1854**\n    *   Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n    *   Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n    *   Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n    *   Battle of Abu Klea: **1885**\n    *   Battle of Mons: **1914**\n    *   Battle of the Somme: **1916**\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: By comparing the dates, the **Battle of the Somme (1916)** is the latest historical battle depicted in a known work by Lady Butler. The work itself is a sketch from 1917 titled *A German Retreat from the Somme*.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinguish Event Date from Painting Date**: It is crucial not to confuse the year a painting was made with the year the event it depicts occurred. For example, *The Defence of Rorke's Drift* was painted in 1880, but the battle happened in 1879.\n*   **Include All Works, Not Just Famous Oils**: The question is general (\"a painting\") and does not exclude sketches or less famous works. Lady Butler's later works, including her sketches of World War I, are relevant.\n*   **Identify Specific Battles**: Paintings like *The Roll Call* depict an aftermath rather than combat, but they are tied to a specific, datable battle (Inkerman, 1854).\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that her subjects spanned from the Napoleonic Wars to World War I, with the latest battle being the Battle of the Somme.\n\n<<<The Battle of the Somme>>>"
