    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001$\n$36 = 4 \\times 9 = 2^2 \\times 3^2$\n$1001 = 7 \\times 143 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$\nSo, the prime factorization of $N$ is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p^k$.\n\nThe key properties we need are:\n1.  **Conductor**: The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its component characters. For $\\chi$ to be a *primitive* character with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a *primitive* character modulo $p^k$.\n2.  **Order**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_9), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    We require this order to be 6.\n\nThis implies that for each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$, its order must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Each Component Character\nWe will now analyze each component character, counting the number of choices that satisfy both the primitivity condition and the order condition (i.e., its order must divide 6).\n\nThe group of characters modulo $m$, $G_m$, is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group $C_n$ is $\\phi(d)$, if $d|n$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_4$ (mod 4):**\n    The group of characters $G_4$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$.\n    -   **Primitivity**: There is one primitive character mod 4 (the non-principal one). The principal character has conductor 1.\n    -   **Order**: The unique primitive character has order 2. Since $2|6$, this character is a valid choice.\n    -   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: **1**. Its order is 2.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_9$ (mod 9):**\n    The group of characters $G_9$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$.\n    -   **Primitivity**: A character mod 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character mod 3. The characters induced from mod 3 form a subgroup of $G_9$ of order $\\phi(3)=2$. In $C_6$, this is the subgroup of elements whose order divides 2 (i.e., orders 1 and 2). Thus, primitive characters mod 9 are those with orders 3 or 6.\n    -   **Order**: The possible orders for primitive characters are 3 and 6. Both orders divide 6.\n        - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    -   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_7$ (mod 7):**\n    The group of characters $G_7$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$.\n    -   **Primitivity**: For a prime modulus $p$, any non-principal character is primitive.\n    -   **Order**: The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of 6, except for 1. These orders are 2, 3, and 6. All of these divide 6.\n        - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    -   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_{11}$ (mod 11):**\n    The group of characters $G_{11}$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$.\n    -   **Primitivity**: Any non-principal character is primitive.\n    -   **Order**: The order $d$ of a chosen character must divide the group order (10) and also divide 6. So, $d$ must divide $\\gcd(10, 6) = 2$. Since the character must be primitive, its order cannot be 1. Thus, its order must be 2.\n        - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    -   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: **1**. Its order is 2.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_{13}$ (mod 13):**\n    The group of characters $G_{13}$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$.\n    -   **Primitivity**: Any non-principal character is primitive.\n    -   **Order**: The order $d$ must divide $\\gcd(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n        - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    -   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Choices and Verify the LCM\nWe have found the number of valid choices for each component character. Let the orders of a chosen tuple of characters be $(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$. We must check if their lcm is 6.\n\nThe possible orders are:\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_{11} = 2$\n*   $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nLet's check the prime factors of the lcm:\n1.  **Divisibility by 2**: Since $d_4=2$ (and $d_{11}=2$), the lcm is always divisible by 2.\n2.  **Divisibility by 3**: Since $d_9$ must be either 3 or 6, the lcm is always divisible by 3.\n3.  **Other prime factors**: Since all possible orders $d_i$ are divisors of 6, their lcm cannot have prime factors other than 2 and 3.\n\nCombining these points, the lcm is always divisible by $2 \\times 3 = 6$. Also, since every $d_i$ divides 6, their lcm must divide 6. Therefore, the lcm is exactly 6 for any combination of the allowed component characters.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character.\n\nNumber = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nNumber = $100$\n\nThus, there are 100 such characters.\n\n<<<100>>>"
