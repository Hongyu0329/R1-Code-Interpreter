    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the equation to find the solution.\n\n**Question:** `XXIV / CCC - CXXXI = ?`\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Roman Numerals:** The equation contains three Roman numerals: `XXIV`, `CCC`, and `CXXXI`.\n2.  **Convert Roman Numerals to Modern Numbers:** We need to translate each Roman numeral into its modern (Arabic) number equivalent.\n    *   **XXIV**: `XX` is 20 (10 + 10) and `IV` is 4 (5 - 1). So, `XXIV` = 20 + 4 = **24**.\n    *   **CCC**: `C` is 100. So, `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**.\n    *   **CXXXI**: `C` is 100, `XXX` is 30 (10 + 10 + 10), and `I` is 1. So, `CXXXI` = 100 + 30 + 1 = **131**.\n3.  **Rewrite the Equation:** Now, substitute the modern numbers back into the original equation.\n    *   The equation `XXIV / CCC - CXXXI` becomes `24 / 300 - 131`.\n4.  **Apply the Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** The order of operations dictates that division must be performed before subtraction.\n    *   **First, perform the division:**\n        `24 / 300 = 0.08`\n    *   **Next, perform the subtraction:**\n        `0.08 - 131 = -130.92`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Roman Numeral Conversion:** It's crucial to correctly interpret both the additive (`XX`, `CCC`) and subtractive (`IV`) principles of Roman numerals.\n*   **Order of Operations:** The most common mistake would be to perform the subtraction before the division. You must follow the standard mathematical order (Division first, then Subtraction).\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n\n1.  Convert numerals: `24`, `300`, `131`.\n2.  Form the equation: `24 / 300 - 131`.\n3.  Calculate division: `24 / 300 = 0.08`.\n4.  Calculate subtraction: `0.08 - 131 = -130.92`.\n\nThe solution to the equation is -130.92.\n\n<<<-130.92>>>"
