The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally **not radial**. Due to the Sun's rotation, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) follows a curved path known as the Parker Spiral, which typically makes an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction at Earth's orbit.

Your expectation to use magnetic components perpendicular to the local magnetic field is theoretically correct. For a field-aligned wave like an Alfv√©n Ion Cyclotron (AIC) wave, a rigorous analysis requires transforming the magnetic field data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system, where one axis is parallel to the local average magnetic field ($\vec{B}_0$) and the other two are perpendicular. The normalized magnetic helicity is then calculated from these two perpendicular components.

The reason you may see the calculation performed using components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., the Y and Z components in the standard GSE coordinate system) is one of practical approximation under specific, selected conditions. Researchers often hunt for AIC waves by specifically selecting time intervals where the IMF is **"quasi-radial"**, meaning it happens to be closely aligned with the solar wind flow direction (which is radial). In these selected cases, the local magnetic field *is* approximately radial, and therefore using the Y and Z components of a radial-based coordinate system is a valid and convenient approximation. This approach simplifies the analysis by avoiding a coordinate transformation for every data point, but it is only accurate when the precondition of a nearly radial magnetic field is met.
