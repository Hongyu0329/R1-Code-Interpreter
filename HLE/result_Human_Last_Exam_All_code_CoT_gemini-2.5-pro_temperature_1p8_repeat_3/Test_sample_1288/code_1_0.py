def solve_bulgakov_riddle():
    """
    This function identifies the parallel characters and bird from
    Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita" based on the theme of
    a small bird tormenting an important character.

    1. Moscow Character: In Chapter 18, Andrei Fokich Sokov, the
       Variety Theatre's buffet-keeper, is tormented by a series of
       strange events after visiting Woland. The final disturbance is
       a house sparrow causing chaos in the office of the doctor he
       consults.

    2. Jerusalem Bird & Character: The parallel occurs in Chapter 2,
       during the trial of Yeshua. A barn swallow darts into the
       colonnade, contributing to the unsettling atmosphere that is
       tormenting the central figure of the scene, Pontius Pilate.
