    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Decode the Colors:** First, I will determine the specific colors mentioned in the question.\n    *   The first color is the result of \"combining yellow and blue,\" which is Green.\n    *   The second color is explicitly stated as \"blue itself.\"\n\n2.  **Apply Newton's Analogy:** I will use Isaac Newton's well-known analogy that maps the seven colors of the visible spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) to the seven notes of a Western musical scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes:** Using this mapping, I will find the musical notes corresponding to the colors identified in step 1.\n    *   Green maps to the note F.\n    *   Blue maps to the note G.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer:** The question asks for the musical note that corresponds to the \"range between\" Green and Blue. This range is defined by the two notes F and G. As the question asks for a single note for the range ending at \"blue itself\", the note corresponding to blue is the answer.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these steps and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_note_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle connecting Newton's color circle to musical notes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the color combination and the resulting color.\n    color_combination = \"Yellow + Blue\"\n    resulting_color = \"Green\"\n    \n    # The second color is explicitly given.\n    second_color = \"Blue\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Define Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes.\n    newton_color_to_note_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the musical notes for our two colors.\n    note_for_first_color = newton_color_to_note_map[resulting_color]\n    note_for_second_color = newton_color_to_note_map[second_color]\n    \n    # Step 4: Display the logic and the final answer.\n    # The prompt requires outputting each 'number' in the final equation.\n    # Since there are no numbers, we will format the color/note relationships as \"equations\".\n    \n    print(f\"Equation 1: ({color_combination}) = {resulting_color} --> Corresponds to Note: {note_for_first_color}\")\n    print(f\"Equation 2: {second_color} --> Corresponds to Note: {note_for_second_color}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe question asks for the note for the range starting from the combined color (Green) and ending at 'blue itself'.\")\n    print(\"The note for the end of this range is the answer.\")\n    \n    final_answer = note_for_second_color\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The musical note is {final_answer}.\")\n\nsolve_newton_note_puzzle()\n```\n<<<G>>>"
