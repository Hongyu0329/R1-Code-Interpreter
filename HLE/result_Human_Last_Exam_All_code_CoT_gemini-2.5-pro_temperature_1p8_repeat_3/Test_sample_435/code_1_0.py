    # Step 1: Explain the role of IL-15
    print("1. Function of IL-15: IL-15 is a key homeostatic cytokine that supports the long-term survival, proliferation, and functional maintenance of memory T cells (specifically CD8+ T cells) and NK cells.")
    
    # Step 2: Impact on CAR T cell phenotype
    print("\n2. Impact on CAR T Cell Manufacturing: Incorporating IL-15 into the T cell culture process preferentially promotes the generation of CAR T cells with a less differentiated, stem cell-like or central memory phenotype. These cells are known for their enhanced persistence and self-renewal capabilities.")

    # Step 3: Link phenotype to functional potential
    print("\n3. Enhanced Cell 'Fitness': This memory-like phenotype results in CAR T cells that are 'fitter' and more potent. They can survive longer in the patient and mount a more robust proliferative response when they encounter their target cancer cells.")

    # Step 4: Final conclusion on cytokine release
    print("\n4. Conclusion on Cytokine Release: A stronger proliferative response and greater cell potency directly translate to a more powerful effector function. Therefore, upon target recognition, IL-15-conditioned CAR T cells are expected to release higher quantities of key effector cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α).")
