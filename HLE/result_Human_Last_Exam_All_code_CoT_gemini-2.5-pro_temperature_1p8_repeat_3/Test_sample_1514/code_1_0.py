    Solves for the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications of the ray.

    # Step 1: Frame the problem using a key theorem from topology.
    # The number of topologically distinct compactifications of the ray [0, infinity)
    # with a given remainder space X is equal to the number of non-homeomorphic
    # retracts of X. A retract of X is a subspace A of X for which there exists
    # a continuous map r: X -> A (called a retraction) such that r(a) = a for all a in A.
    # Our task is to find the minimum number of non-homeomorphic retracts over all
    # possible choices of X, where X is a non-degenerate, locally-connected,
    # compact metric space.

    # Step 2: Establish a lower bound for this number.
    # For any non-degenerate space X, we can identify at least two distinct types of retracts.
    #
    # Retract 1: The space X itself.
    # The identity map, id(x) = x, is a retraction from X to X.
    # Thus, X is always a retract of itself.
    #
    # Retract 2: A single point {p} in X.
    # The constant map, c_p(x) = p, is a retraction from X to the subspace {p}.
    # So, any singleton set {p} is a retract of X. All singleton sets are homeomorphic.
    #
    # The problem specifies that X is "non-degenerate", which means it consists of more than one point.
    # Therefore, the retract X is not homeomorphic to the retract {p}.
    # This proves that any space X satisfying the conditions must have at least two
    # non-homeomorphic retracts.
    lower_bound = 2

    # Step 3: Find a specific space X that meets this lower bound.
    # We need to find a space X that satisfies the given criteria and has exactly two
    # non-homeomorphic retracts.
    #
    # Consider the closed unit interval X = [0, 1].
    # - It is a compact metric space.
    # - It is locally-connected.
    # - It is non-degenerate.
    #
    # The retracts of the interval [0, 1] are its closed and connected subsets.
    # The connected subsets of [0, 1] are intervals. Therefore, the retracts are
    # closed intervals [a, b] contained in [0, 1].

    # Step 4: Classify the retracts of X = [0, 1] by homeomorphism.
    # The retracts [a, b] of [0, 1] fall into two topological classes:
    #
    # Class 1: Single points. This occurs when a = b. All these retracts are
    #          homeomorphic to a single point.
    # Class 2: Closed intervals of positive length. This occurs when a < b. All these
    #          retracts are homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1] itself.
    #
    # So, X = [0, 1] has exactly two non-homeomorphic retracts: "a point" and "an interval".
    # The number of non-homeomorphic retracts for X = [0, 1] is 2.
    num_for_interval = 2

    # Step 5: Conclude the final answer.
    # We have established a lower bound of 2 for the number of non-homeomorphic retracts.
    # We have found an example space, X = [0, 1], that has exactly 2.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number is 2.
    final_answer = 2

    # In the context of the problem, the final equation is simply the determination
    # of this minimum number. We print the number from our derived answer.
    print(f"The smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications is {final_answer}.")
