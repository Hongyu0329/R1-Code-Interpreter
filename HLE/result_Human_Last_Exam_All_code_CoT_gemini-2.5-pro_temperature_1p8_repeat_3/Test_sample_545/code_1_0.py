def solve_iupac_name():
    """
    This function determines the IUPAC name of the major product for the described reaction.

    1.  **Starting Material:** ((2-((2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl)oxy)ethyl)sulfinyl)benzene
        -   Structure: Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2
            (Ph = Phenyl group, C6H5)

    2.  **Reaction:** The reactant is a sulfoxide. Heating a sulfoxide with available beta-hydrogens
        (on the ethyl group) causes a thermal syn-elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction).

    3.  **Mechanism & Product:** The sulfoxide oxygen abstracts a beta-proton, and the phenylsulfinyl group
        (Ph-S(=O)-) is eliminated. This forms a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons
        of the ethyl chain.
        -   Elimination of PhSOH from Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-R gives CH2=CH-R.
        -   In our case, R = -O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.
        -   Major Product Structure: CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2

    4.  **IUPAC Naming (Replacement Nomenclature):**
        -   Substitutive naming is awkward for this structure. Replacement nomenclature is preferred.
        -   We find the longest continuous chain of atoms, including the oxygen.
        -   Chain: C=C-O-C(Me)2-C=C  (Atoms: C-C-O-C-C=C)
        -   Numbering for lowest locants for double bonds:
            C(1)H2=C(2)H - O(3) - C(4)(CH3)2 - C(5)H=C(6)H2
        -   The parent hydrocarbon (replacing O with CH2) would be a hexa-1,5-diene.
        -   The oxygen is at position 3, so it's a "3-oxa" derivative.
        -   Two methyl groups are on position 4, so we add "4,4-dimethyl".
        -   Combining these parts gives the final name.
