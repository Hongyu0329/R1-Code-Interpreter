    This function analyzes the ethogram and answer choices to determine which behavior
    most benefits plant fitness, then prints the result.

    The key insight is that plant fitness in this context means pollination.
    Pollination on a milkweed umbel (a cluster of flowers) is maximized when an
    insect visits as many individual florets as possible during its visit.

    Let's analyze the options:
    A. 4-3 >> 6-5: Total contact time >> feeding time. The insect spends most of its contact time not feeding, which is less efficient for pollination.
    B. 6-5 >> 4-3: Feeding time >> interaction time. Logically impossible, as feeding is a part of interaction.
    C. 4-3 >> 2-1: Contact time >> non-contact investigation time. Good, but doesn't describe the effectiveness of the contact itself.
    D. n(5)/hour >> n(3)/hour: Number of feeding starts >> number of interaction starts. This is the most effective pattern. It implies that for each time the insect lands on the flower cluster (one interaction start), it initiates many separate feeding bouts (many feeding starts). This corresponds to the insect moving around the umbel and pollinating many individual flowers.
    E. n(1)/hour >> n(3)/hour: Many investigations, few interactions. A poor pollinator.
    F. n(3)/hour >> n(1)/hour: Many interactions, few investigations. Logically impossible, as an interaction must be preceded by an investigation.

    Conclusion: Pattern D describes the most effective pollinator for a milkweed umbel.
