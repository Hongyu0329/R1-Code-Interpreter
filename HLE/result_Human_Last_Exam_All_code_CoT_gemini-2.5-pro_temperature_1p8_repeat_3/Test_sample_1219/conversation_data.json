    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of `tan(10^100)`. The number `10^100` is a googol, which is far too large for standard floating-point data types to handle accurately.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  The `tan` function is periodic with a period of π. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. Our first step is to reduce the enormous argument `10^100` by finding its remainder when divided by π.\n2.  Standard math libraries lack the required precision for this calculation. `10^100` is a 1 followed by 100 zeros. To find the remainder `10^100 mod π` accurately, we need to know the value of π to more than 100 decimal places.\n3.  We will use Python's `mpmath` library, which is designed for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic.\n4.  We will set the precision of `mpmath` to a value comfortably greater than 100 digits.\n5.  Using `mpmath`, we will calculate `y = 10^100 % π`.\n6.  Then, we will calculate `z = tan(y)`.\n7.  Finally, we will extract and print the first three digits of `z` that appear after the decimal point.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# Set the precision for our calculations.\n# The number 10^100 has 101 digits. We need more precision than that.\n# Let's set the number of decimal places (dps) to 110.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# The large number from the problem statement\n# mpmath.mpf() creates a high-precision floating-point number.\nx = mpmath.mpf(10)**100\n\n# The tangent function is periodic with period pi.\n# So, tan(10^100) is the same as tan(10^100 mod pi).\n# We calculate this remainder using mpmath's high-precision pi.\nangle_mod_pi = x % mpmath.pi\n\n# Now, calculate the tangent of the smaller, equivalent angle.\nresult = mpmath.tan(angle_mod_pi)\n\n# We need to output the numbers in the final equation.\n# The final equation is tan(10^100 mod pi) = result.\n# Let's print the intermediate and final values.\n\n# We represent 10^100 textually as it's too big to print.\nprint(\"The calculation steps are:\")\nprint(\"tan(10^100) = tan(10^100 mod pi)\")\n# Print the value of the angle after the modulo operation, truncated for display.\nprint(f\"tan(10^100 mod pi) = tan({mpmath.nstr(angle_mod_pi, 10)}...)\")\n# Print the final result of the tan function, truncated for display.\nprint(f\"tan({mpmath.nstr(angle_mod_pi, 10)}...) = {mpmath.nstr(result, 10)}...\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# To find the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point),\n# we convert the result to a string.\nresult_str = mpmath.nstr(result)\n\n# Find the position of the decimal point.\ndecimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n\n# Extract the 3 characters immediately after the decimal point.\nif decimal_point_index != -1:\n    first_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n    print(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are: {first_three_digits}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not find a decimal point in the result.\")\n\n```\n<<<008>>>"
