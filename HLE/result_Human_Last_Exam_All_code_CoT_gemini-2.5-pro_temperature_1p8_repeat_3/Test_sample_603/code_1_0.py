Analysis of the Limitation in Bulk Nucleic Acid Melting Experiments:

1.  The method described is a "bulk" experiment, meaning it measures the average properties of a massive ensemble of molecules all at once.
2.  The question asks for a limitation that exists even under "ideal experimental conditions," which implies the issue is fundamental to the method, not an experimental error like poor temperature control.
3.  In any large population of molecules, there can be "heterogeneity." This means not all molecules are perfectly identical or in the same state. Some might have slight conformational differences, be partially misfolded, or interact with neighbors differently.
4.  A bulk measurement averages the behavior of all these molecules together. For example, if one subpopulation melts at 60°C and another at 62°C, a bulk experiment might show a single, broad transition centered around 61°C. It is impossible to tell from the bulk data that two distinct populations exist.
5.  This "impossibility to capture heterogeneity" is a core limitation of ensemble measurements. Choices A and B are model assumptions, not measurement limitations. Choices D and E are experimental imperfections, ruled out by the "ideal conditions" premise.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
