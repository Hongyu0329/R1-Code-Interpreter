    "To find the number of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2, we need to analyze the properties of such a set and the group that contains it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Definitions:**\n    *   A **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset where for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (possibly `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`.\n    *   A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n    *   We are looking for groups `G` that contain such a set `S` with `|S|=2`. Let `S = {a, b}` with `a ≠ b`.\n\n2.  **Initial Constraints on the Set `S = {a, b}`:**\n    *   **Product-free condition**: The products `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b` must not be in `{a, b}`. This immediately implies that neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element `e`.\n    *   **Maximality condition**: For any element `g` in `G \\ {a, b}`, the new set `{a, b, g}` must *not* be product-free.\n\n3.  **Deductions from Maximality:**\n    Let's test the maximality condition with the inverses of `a` and `b`.\n    *   The inverse `a⁻¹` must exist in the finite group `G`.\n    *   If `a⁻¹` is not in `S = {a, b}`, then we can test the maximality condition by adding it. Let `g = a⁻¹`. The set `{a, b, a⁻¹}` must not be product-free.\n    *   One of the products formed from `{a, b, a⁻¹}` must be an element of the set. The product `a * a⁻¹ = e` (the identity element) is always formed. For `{a, b, a⁻¹}` to be non-product-free because of this, `e` must be an element of `{a, b, a⁻¹}`.\n    *   We already established that `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`. Therefore, we must have `a⁻¹ = e`, which implies `a=e`, a contradiction.\n    *   This contradiction means our initial assumption (`a⁻¹` is not in `S`) must be false. So, `a⁻¹` must be in `{a, b}`.\n    *   Similarly, `b⁻¹` must be in `{a, b}`.\n\n4.  **Two Possible Cases for `S`:**\n    The condition `{a⁻¹, b⁻¹} = {a, b}` leads to two distinct cases for the set `S`:\n    *   **Case 1:** `a⁻¹ = a` and `b⁻¹ = b`. Both `a` and `b` are involutions (elements of order 2). A deep dive into this case shows that the group must be isomorphic to the **Klein four-group `V₄`** (also written as `C₂ × C₂`).\n    *   **Case 2:** `a⁻¹ = b` (and `b⁻¹ = a`). The set is `S = {a, a⁻¹}` where `a` is not an involution (`a² ≠ e`). An analysis of this case shows that the group must be a cyclic group `Cₙ` and that `{a, a⁻¹}` is only a maximal product-free set for `n=4`, `n=5`, and `n=7`. The corresponding groups are **`C₄`**, **`C₅`**, and **`C₇`**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining the results from both cases, we find that there are exactly four non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a maximal product-free set of size 2:\n    1.  `C₄` (The cyclic group of order 4)\n    2.  `C₅` (The cyclic group of order 5)\n    3.  `C₇` (The cyclic group of order 7)\n    4.  `V₄` (The Klein four-group, `C₂ × C₂`)\n\nTherefore, the total number of such groups is 4.\n\n### Python Verification Code\nThe following Python code verifies this conclusion by defining the group structures and computationally checking for the described property. It iterates through possible subsets of size 2 for several small groups and determines if any of them are maximal and product-free.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef is_product_free(s, group_elements, op):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a subset 's' is product-free.\"\"\"\n    s_set = set(s)\n    for s1 in s:\n        for s2 in s:\n            product = op(s1, s2)\n            if product in s_set:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(group):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a group contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    The group is defined by its elements and multiplication table.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = group['elements']\n    op = group['op']\n    n = len(elements)\n    \n    # We need at least 3 elements to have a non-trivial subset of size 2\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n        \n    # Iterate through all subsets of size 2\n    for s in combinations(elements, 2):\n        s_list = list(s)\n        \n        # Check if the subset is product-free\n        if is_product_free(s_list, elements, op):\n            \n            # If it is product-free, check for maximality\n            is_maximal = True\n            other_elements = [g for g in elements if g not in s_list]\n            \n            for g in other_elements:\n                s_prime = s_list + [g]\n                if is_product_free(s_prime, elements, op):\n                    # Found a larger product-free set containing s, so s is not maximal\n                    is_maximal = False\n                    break\n            \n            if is_maximal:\n                # Found a maximal product-free set of size 2\n                return True\n                \n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines several small finite groups and checks them for the property.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Group definitions\n    # C_n: Cyclic group of order n.
