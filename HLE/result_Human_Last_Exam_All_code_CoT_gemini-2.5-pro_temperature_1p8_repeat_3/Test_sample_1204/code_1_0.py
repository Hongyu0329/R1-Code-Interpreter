    # Rationale for selecting the best options:
    # 1. The patient's heavy, daily cannabis use is a major confounding factor for his anxiety, insomnia,
    #    and the perceived ineffectiveness of his medications. Addressing this is a top priority.
    # 2. A urine drug test is essential to obtain objective data on substance use, which is critical for
    #    diagnosis and for safely managing his request for stimulants.
    # 3. The patient's insomnia is a major complaint. Providing a safe, non-addictive option like
    #    melatonin can offer symptomatic relief while the more complex issues are addressed.
    # Options like hospitalizing the patient to stop all medications are dangerous, and changing his
    # alcohol use medication is not an immediate priority as he is in remission. The patient is already
    # on atomoxetine, so starting it is not a valid option.

    # The chosen combination of immediate priorities is I, III, and IV.

        "I": "Counsel patient on stopping cannabis.",
