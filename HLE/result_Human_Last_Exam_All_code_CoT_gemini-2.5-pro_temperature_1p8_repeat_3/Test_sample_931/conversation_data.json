    "My plan is to systematically evaluate each answer choice based on established knowledge of the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies). I will write a Python script that codifies this biological information. The script will then check each option and identify all valid food sources. Finally, it will select the composite answer choice that most accurately and completely describes the snakefly diet from the given options and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the question and options\n    question = \"Which of the following have Raphidiopterans been recorded feeding on as adults?\"\n    options = {\n        'A': \"Nectar\",\n        'B': \"Māhoe pollen\",\n        'C': \"Fungus\",\n        'D': \"Karamū leaf tissue\",\n        'E': \"Totara Aphids\",\n        'F': \"A and E\",\n        'G': \"D and E\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Establish known facts about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # Fact 1: They are primarily predatory, feeding on small, soft-bodied arthropods.

Adults are predators that feed on soft-bodied insects like aphids.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identifying the most comprehensive correct answer.\")\n    # Step 3: Check composite options.
