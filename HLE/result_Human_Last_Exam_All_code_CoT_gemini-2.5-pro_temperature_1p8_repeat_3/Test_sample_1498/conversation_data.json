    "My plan is to identify the specific verses (bayts) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the 25 prophets of Islam are enumerated.\n\n1.  I will first locate a standard version of the poem's text.\n2.  I will then scan the poem to find the section dedicated to the prophets ('anbiya').\n3.  The enumeration starts with a verse stating that the details of twenty-five prophets are necessary to know. I will identify this starting verse number.\n4.  The following verses explain how this number is reached: one verse cleverly references a Quranic passage that contains 18 prophets, and the next verse lists the remaining seven by name to complete the count of 25. I will identify the ending verse number of this section.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that defines these start and end verse numbers and prints the answer in a clear, formatted sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayts) in\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that mention the names of the 25 prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The discussion and enumeration of the prophets begins at this verse,\n    # where the author states that knowing 25 of them is obligatory.\n    start_bayt = 19\n\n    # The enumeration is completed by this verse, which lists the final 7\n    # prophets by name, after the previous verse referred to the first 18.\n    end_bayt = 21\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the topic of the 25 prophets is covered in a specific section.\")\n    print(f\"The section begins at bayt number {start_bayt}, which introduces the obligation to know them.\")\n    print(f\"The section concludes at bayt number {end_bayt}, which completes the list.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the prophets are mentioned from bayt {} to bayt {}.\".format(start_bayt, end_bayt))\n\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<From bayt 19 to bayt 21>>>"
