# The user wants me to identify the correct medical treatment from a list of choices.
# The patient's symptoms (profuse bleeding, low blood pressure, high heart rate, cold/clammy skin, disorientation) point strongly to hypovolemic/hemorrhagic shock.
# The goal is to choose the best first-line treatment for this condition.

# A. Lay down the person and elevate legs along with CPR.
# CPR is only for cardiac arrest (no pulse). The patient has a pulse (HR 160). This is incorrect.

# B. Administer anticlotting medicine such as aspirin or heparin.
# The patient is actively bleeding. Anticlotting medicine would worsen the bleeding. This is highly dangerous and incorrect.

# C. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline or Ringer's lactate.
# This is the standard of care for hypovolemic shock. The immediate priority is to restore intravascular volume with isotonic crystalloid fluids to improve blood pressure and organ perfusion. This is the correct answer.

# D. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline.
# While normal saline is used, option C is better because it also includes Ringer's lactate, another standard first-line fluid. Therefore, C is a more complete answer.

# E. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline with fructose.
# Fluids containing sugar (dextrose/fructose) are not the primary choice for initial volume resuscitation in trauma, as the priority is restoring volume, not providing calories.

# The best choice is C, as it describes the immediate, life-saving intervention required.
# Although this is a medical question, the request is to provide code. I will create a simple script that states the chosen answer.
