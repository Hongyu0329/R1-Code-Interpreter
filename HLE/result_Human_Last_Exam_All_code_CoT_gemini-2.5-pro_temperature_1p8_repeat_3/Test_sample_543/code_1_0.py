    This function determines and returns the IUPAC name of the chemical product.
    The logic is based on established principles of organic chemistry.

    Reactants: 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and excess phenyl magnesium bromide (PhMgBr).
    Conditions: Reflux in THF, followed by aqueous work-up.

    Analysis:
    1. This is a Grignard cross-coupling reaction.
    2. The reactivity of aryl halides in this reaction is I > Br > Cl.
    3. The reaction will proceed via stepwise substitution of the halogens with phenyl groups.
        - First, the most reactive C-I bond at position 2 is substituted.
        - Then, because excess PhMgBr and reflux conditions are used, the two less reactive
          C-Br bonds at positions 1 and 3 are also substituted.
    4. The final product is a benzene ring with phenyl groups attached at positions 1, 2, and 3.
    5. The IUPAC name for this structure is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.
