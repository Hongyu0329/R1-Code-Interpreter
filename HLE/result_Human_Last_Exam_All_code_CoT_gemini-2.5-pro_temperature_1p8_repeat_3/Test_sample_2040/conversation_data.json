    "To answer this question, we first need to understand the physical requirements for a material to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Then, we will assess if boron nanosheets meet these requirements.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the physical mechanism:** Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical effect.\n2.  **Identify the material property requirement:** For a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear effect, its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion. In other words, the material must be non-centrosymmetric. Materials with a center of symmetry (centrosymmetric) have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) and therefore cannot exhibit SPDC.\n3.  **Investigate the structure of boron nanosheets:** Boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, can exist in several different structural phases (polymorphs). The most common and stable phases that have been synthesized (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are known to be centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Draw a conclusion:** Since the common, stable forms of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, they possess a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾ = 0).\n5.  **Finalize the answer:** Consequently, they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning to arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes whether boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the primary requirement for SPDC.\n    # SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. It requires a material\n    # with a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, chi^(2).\n    spdc_requirement = \"Non-zero second-order susceptibility (chi^(2))\"\n\n    # Step 2: Define the material property that allows for a non-zero chi^(2).\n    # A material's crystal lattice must lack a center of inversion symmetry\n    # to have a non-zero chi^(2). Such materials are called non-centrosymmetric.\n    chi2_requirement = \"Non-centrosymmetric crystal structure\"\n\n    # Step 3: State the known crystal structure of common boron nanosheets (borophene).\n    # The most common and stable phases of borophene (e.g., beta_12, chi_3)\n    # have a center of inversion symmetry.\n    boron_nanosheet_symmetry = \"Centrosymmetric\"\n\n    # Step 4: Evaluate if boron nanosheets meet the requirement.\n    is_non_centrosymmetric = (boron_nanosheet_symmetry == \"Non-centrosymmetric\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"1. Requirement for SPDC: A material must have a {spdc_requirement}.\")\n    print(f\"2. Prerequisite for this property: The material must have a {chi2_requirement}.\")\n    print(f\"3. Property of common Boron Nanosheets: The crystal structure is {boron_nanosheet_symmetry}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    if is_non_centrosymmetric:\n        print(\"Result: Yes, boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit SPDC.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Result: No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\")\n        print(\"Reason: Their common crystal structures are centrosymmetric, which means their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (chi^(2)) is zero.\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nanalyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets()\n```\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is because the common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, a crystal property that forbids second-order nonlinear optical effects like SPDC.>>>"
