    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. The size of a semidihedral group is always a power of 2, so we can write its size as $2^n$. Here, $512 = 2^9$, so we are dealing with the group $G = SD_{2^9}$. In this notation, $n=9$.\n\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is the set of the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$, for some integer $k$. We denote this set as $G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$. The task is to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of Power Subgroups in $SD_{2^n}$:**\n    *   The power subgroups of $G = SD_{2^n}$ are determined by the exponent of the integer $k$. We can write any integer $k$ as $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd number.\n    *   It can be shown that for any odd $m$, the power subgroup $G^m$ is the group $G$ itself. This means that $G^k = (G^m)^{2^j} = G^{2^j}$. So, we only need to count the distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^{2^0}, G^{2^1}, G^{2^2}, \\dots$.\n    *   For $j=0$, we have $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$. This is one power subgroup, which is the group itself.\n    *   For $j \\geq 1$, it can be shown that the power subgroup $G^{2^j}$ is a cyclic subgroup of $G$. Specifically, if $\\langle r \\rangle$ is the maximal cyclic subgroup of order $2^{n-1}$, then $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups:**\n    *   The first power subgroup is $G$ itself.\n    *   The other power subgroups are of the form $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ for $j=1, 2, \\dots$. Since the order of $r$ is $2^{n-1}$ (which is 256 for $n=9$), these subgroups are distinct for $j=1, 2, \\dots, n-1$.\n    *   This gives us $n-1$ distinct cyclic subgroups: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{2^{n-1}} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. For $n=9$, this is $9-1=8$ subgroups.\n    *   The group $G$ is non-abelian, while the subgroups $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ are all cyclic and therefore abelian. So, $G$ is distinct from all the others.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the non-cyclic one ($G$) and the distinct cyclic ones. This gives a total of $1 + (n-1) = n$ power subgroups. For the semidihedral group of size 512, $n=9$, so the total is 9.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group of size 2^n has n power subgroups.\n    # First, find n for the given group size.\n    # group_size = 2^n\n    # n = log2(group_size)\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # For the semidihedral group G = SD_{2^n}, the power subgroups are:\n    # 1. The group G itself.\n    # 2. The n-1 distinct cyclic subgroups of the form <r^(2^j)> for j=1, ..., n-1.\n    \n    # Number of non-cyclic power subgroups (just G itself)\n    num_non_cyclic = 1\n\n    # Number of distinct cyclic power subgroups\n    num_cyclic = n - 1\n\n    # The total number of power subgroups is the sum of these two counts.\n    total_power_subgroups = num_non_cyclic + num_cyclic\n\n    print(f\"For the semidihedral group of size {group_size}, n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The number of power subgroups is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"Number of non-cyclic power subgroups: {num_non_cyclic}\")\n    print(f\"Number of cyclic power subgroups: n - 1 = {n} - 1 = {num_cyclic}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of these two values.\")\n    print(f\"Total = {num_non_cyclic} + {num_cyclic} = {total_power_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
