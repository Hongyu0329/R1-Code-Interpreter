    print("2. The most common and effective medication prescribed for Bipolar Disorder is Lithium, a mood stabilizer.")
    print("3. After beginning this new treatment, the patient developed decreased sexual interest.")

While heavy metal exposure is a factor in the patient's history, it does not explain the specific sequence of psychiatric symptoms followed by a medication-induced side effect.")
