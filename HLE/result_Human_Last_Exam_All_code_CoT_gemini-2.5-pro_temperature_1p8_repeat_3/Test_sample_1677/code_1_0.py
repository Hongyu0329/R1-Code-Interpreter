    Identifies the incorrect or inappropriate explanations for the trend in Japanese university entrants.

    A. The decrease in the 18-year-old population was smaller than predicted: This is factually incorrect. The decline was as sharp as, or even sharper than, predicted.
    B. Increase in university enrollment rate: This is correct. The rate has increased significantly, offsetting the population decline.
    C. Increased demand for re-learning by working adults: This is a correct and contributing trend.
    D. Diversification of higher education (working as prep schools): This is an inappropriate explanation. The popularity of two-year colleges has declined in favor of four-year universities; they are not a growing feeder system in the way described.
    E. Government policies: This is correct. Eased establishment standards led to more universities.

    The incorrect/inappropriate options are A and D.
