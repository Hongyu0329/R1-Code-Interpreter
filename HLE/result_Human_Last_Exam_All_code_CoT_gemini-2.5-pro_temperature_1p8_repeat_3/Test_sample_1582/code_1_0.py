    print("We are considering an irreducible Markov chain on a countable state space Sigma.")
    print("We are given:")
    print("1. A finite subset A of Sigma.")
    print("2. A non-negative function f: Sigma -> R_+.")
    print("3. For all x not in A, the expected one-step change of f is non-negative:")
    print("   sum_{y} p(x,y) * f(y) - f(x) >= 0")
    print("4. f(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity (i.e., for any M, the set {x | f(x) <= M} is finite).")
    print("\nThe question is: Can one conclude that the Markov chain is not positive recurrent?")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("\n--- Reasoning and Solution ---")
    print("The answer to this question is 'Yes'. The proof relies on a classic result from the theory of Markov chains known as the Foster-Lyapunov criterion for transience or null recurrence. It's essentially the counterpart to Foster's criterion for positive recurrence.")

    print("\nStep 1: The relevant theorem")
    print("A standard theorem (e.g., from Meyn and Tweedie, 'Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability') states that an irreducible Markov chain is NOT positive recurrent (i.e., it is either transient or null recurrent) if there exists:")
    print(" - A non-negative test function f,")
    print(" - A finite set A,")
    print("such that the following conditions hold:")
    print(" (a) For all x not in A, E[f(X_1) | X_0=x] - f(x) >= 0.")
    print(" (b) There exists at least one state x_0 not in A such that f(x_0) > sup_{y in A} f(y).")

    print("\nStep 2: Verifying the conditions of the theorem")
    print("Let's check if the conditions given in the problem statement satisfy the premises of this theorem.")
    print(" - The existence of the function 'f' and the finite set 'A' is given.")
    print(" - Condition (a) of the theorem is an exact match with condition 3 from the problem: sum_{y} p(x,y) * f(y) - f(x) >= 0 for x not in A.")
    print(" - Now let's check condition (b). Let K = sup_{y in A} f(y). Since A is a finite set, K must be a finite value.")
    print("   Condition 4 from the problem states that f(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity. This means that for any value, including K, the set of states {x | f(x) <= K} is finite.")
    print("   Since the state space Sigma is countably infinite (a requirement for such a function f to exist in a non-trivial chain), there must be states x where f(x) > K.")
    print("   For any such state x_0, we have f(x_0) > K = sup_{y in A} f(y), which implies x_0 cannot be in A.")
    print("   Therefore, condition (b) of the theorem is also satisfied.")

    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion")
    print("Since all the premises of the theorem are met, we can apply its conclusion. The theorem states that the chain is either transient or null recurrent.")
    print("A chain that is transient or null recurrent is, by definition, not positive recurrent.")
    print("Thus, based on the given properties, we can definitively conclude that the Markov chain is not positive recurrent.")

    print("\n" + "="*20 + " FINAL ANSWER " + "="*20)
    print("Yes, one can conclude from the given properties that the Markov chain is not positive recurrent.")
