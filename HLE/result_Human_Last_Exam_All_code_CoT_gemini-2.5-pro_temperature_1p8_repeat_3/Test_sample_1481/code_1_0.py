# The result H(s, s') = |s'-s| - (kappa(s)^2/24)|s'-s|^3 + O(|s'-s|^5)
# provides the leading-order behavior.
# This can be used to derive the billiard map's properties in the near-grazing incidence limit.
# The term with kappa^2 shows that a non-zero curvature is crucial for non-trivial dynamics in this limit.
# For a straight boundary (kappa=0), the map simplifies significantly.
# Thus, the curvature fundamentally connects the geometry of the billiard table to its dynamical properties.
# Final value derived is the asymptotic equation itself.
