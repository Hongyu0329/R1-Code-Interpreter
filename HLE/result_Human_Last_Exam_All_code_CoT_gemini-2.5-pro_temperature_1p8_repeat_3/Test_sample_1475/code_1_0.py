    Problem Analysis and Solution Steps:

    1. The set in question is a countable intersection of open dense subsets of P(X), known as a comeager set.
    
    2. By the Baire Category Theorem, a comeager set in a Baire space is dense. We must show P(X) is a Baire space.
       - X is a compact, and therefore complete, metric space.
       - The hyperspace 2^X with the Hausdorff metric is also a complete metric space.
       - P(X), the space of compact sets with exactly one limit point, is a G_delta subset of 2^X.
       - A G_delta subset of a complete metric space is a Baire space. Thus, P(X) is a Baire space.

    3. The intersection set is dense in P(X).
    
    4. P(X) is a perfect space (it has no isolated points) because X is connected. A dense subset of a perfect space has a cardinality no less than the space itself. Thus, the minimum cardinality we seek is the cardinality of P(X).
    
    5. We determine the cardinality of P(X).
       - An element of P(X) is a countable subset of X. The number of countable subsets of X is |X|^aleph_0.
       - Any compact connected metric space X with more than one point has cardinality c = 2^aleph_0.
       - An upper bound for |P(X)| is c^aleph_0 = (2^aleph_0)^aleph_0 = 2^aleph_0 = c.
       - A lower bound can be shown by constructing c distinct elements in P(X). For X=[0,1], the sets S U {0} for every infinite subset S of {1/n} form a collection of c distinct elements of P(X).
       - Therefore, the cardinality of P(X) is c.

    6. Conclusion: The smallest possible cardinality of the intersection is c, the cardinality of the continuum.
