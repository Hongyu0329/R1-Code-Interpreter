    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing level of the antecedent part of the rule (`Phi_k(x′)`) with the firing level of the consequent part (`μG_k_j(y_j)`) using a t-norm operation.\n\nThe t-norm operation functions as a fuzzy \"AND\". The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  Assign the given values to variables: `phi_k = 0.7` and `mu_G = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values: `activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)`.\n3.  Print the equation and the final calculated activation level.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values for the firing levels\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n# In fuzzy logic, the activation level of a rule is often determined by\n# applying a t-norm operation to the antecedent and consequent firing levels.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, T(a, b) = min(a, b).\n# We will use the minimum t-norm to calculate the rule activation level.\nactivation_level = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the result\nprint(\"Calculating the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"activation_level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"activation_level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\nprint(f\"The final rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
