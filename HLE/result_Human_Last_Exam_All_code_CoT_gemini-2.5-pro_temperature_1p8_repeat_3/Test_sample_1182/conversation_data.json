    "To find the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+1x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we follow a multi-step process.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Find a Good Model:** The given equation has coefficients that are highly divisible by 2. When we reduce it modulo 2, we get $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, or $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This is a highly singular \"double line\" and doesn't directly tell us the structure of the stable reduction. We need to find a better \"integral model\" of the curve by a change of variables.\n\n2.  **Change of Variables:** Let's try the substitution $x = X/2$ and $y=Y/2^k$ for some integer $k$. The goal is to find a new equation where the coefficients are more stable modulo 2. Let's substitute $x=X/2$ into the original equation:\n    $y^2 = 8(X/2)^5 + 4(X/4)^4 + 4(X/2)^3 + (X/2)^2 + 8(X/2)$\n    $y^2 = 8X^5/32 + 4X^4/16 + 4X^3/8 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n    $y^2 = X^5/4 + X^4/4 + X^3/2 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n    To clear the denominators and obtain an equation with integer coefficients, we can multiply the entire equation by 4:\n    $4y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$\n    Now, let $Y = 2y$. The equation becomes:\n    $Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$\n    This is a new model of the same curve over the rational numbers, but it behaves better when we reduce it modulo 2.\n\n3.  **Reduce the New Model Modulo 2:** Reducing the coefficients of the new model modulo 2, we get:\n    $\\bar{C}: Y^2 \\equiv X^5 + X^4 + 0 \\cdot X^3 + X^2 + 0 \\cdot X \\pmod{2}$\n    $\\bar{C}: Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + X^2$\n    This reduced curve $\\bar{C}$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is singular, but its singularities are simpler to analyze. The stable reduction is found by resolving the singularities of this curve, and the number of double points is the number of nodes that form in this resolution.\n\n4.  **Find the Singularities of the Reduced Curve:** A point $(X_0, Y_0)$ on the curve is singular if the partial derivatives of the curve's equation with respect to both $X$ and $Y$ are zero at that point. Let $F(X,Y) = Y^2 - (X^5 + X^4 + X^2)$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} = 2Y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$ (This is always zero in characteristic 2).\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = -(5X^4 + 4X^3 + 2X) \\equiv -X^4 \\equiv X^4 \\pmod{2}$.\n    For a singularity, we need $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} = 0$, which implies $X^4=0$, so $X=0$.\n    Substituting $X=0$ into the curve equation gives $Y^2 = 0$, so $Y=0$.\n    Thus, there is one singular point in the affine plane at $(0,0)$. This type of singularity, $Y^2=X^2(X^3+X^2+1)$, is a tacnode, and its resolution contributes **one** double point to the stable reduction.\n\n5.  **Check for Singularities at Infinity:** We must also check the point at infinity. We homogenize the equation of $\\bar{C}$ with a third variable $Z$:\n    $Y^2Z^3 = X^5 + X^4Z + X^2Z^3$\n    The point(s) at infinity correspond to $Z=0$. Setting $Z=0$ gives $X^5=0$, which implies $X=0$. So there is one point at infinity, which in projective coordinates is $(X:Y:Z) = (0:1:0)$. To analyze the singularity here, we switch to a different chart, for example by setting $Y=1$:\n    $Z^3 = X^5 + X^4Z + X^2Z^3$\n    The point $(0:1:0)$ corresponds to the origin $(X,Z)=(0,0)$ in this chart. The lowest degree terms of the equation are $Z^3$ and $X^5$, which indicates a complex singularity. This singularity also needs to be resolved, and its resolution contributes another **one** double point.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The reduced curve has two singular points: one at $(0,0)$ and one at infinity. Each of these singularities resolves to a double point in the stable reduction. Therefore, the total number of double points is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to find the affine singularities of the reduced curve, confirming our analysis in step 4.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variables for our polynomial over F_2\nX, Y = sympy.symbols('X Y')\n\n# Define the polynomial for the reduced curve\n# In F_2, we work with integers mod 2. 5x^4 becomes x^4, etc.\nF = Y**2 - (X**5 + X**4 + X**2)\n\n# Calculate the partial derivatives\nF_X = sympy.diff(F, X)\nF_Y = sympy.diff(F, Y)\n\n# In F_2, we perform calculations modulo 2\n# sympy's Poly can handle this\npoly_F = sympy.Poly(F, X, Y, modulus=2)\npoly_F_X = sympy.Poly(F_X, X, Y, modulus=2)\npoly_F_Y = sympy.Poly(F_Y, X, Y, modulus=2)\n\n# Find the singular points by solving the system {F=0, dF/dX=0, dF/dY=0} mod 2\nsingular_points = sympy.solve([poly_F, poly_F_X, poly_F_Y], [X, Y])\n\nprint(f\"The equation of the reduced curve is: Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + X^2\")\nprint(f\"Partial derivative w.r.t X (mod 2): {poly_F_X.as_expr()}\")\nprint(f\"Partial derivative w.r.t Y (mod 2): {poly_F_Y.as_expr()}\")\nprint(f\"The affine singular points are: {singular_points}\")\n\n# From our step-by-step analysis, we know:\n# 1.
