    "The value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis is the time interval itself. This interval is most commonly known as the **R-R interval**, named after the R-wave peaks on an electrocardiogram (ECG). A more general term, especially for data from photoplethysmography (PPG) which does not have R-waves, is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nHRV is the statistical measure of the variation in these successive intervals.\n\nThe following Python script will print these terms.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_term():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The value is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.\n    # There are two common names for this interval.\n    primary_term = \"R-R interval\"\n    general_term = \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\"\n\n    print(f\"The value measured between heartbeats to compute HRV is the time interval itself.\")\n    print(f\"This is most commonly called the '{primary_term}' or more generally the '{general_term}'.\")\n\nget_hrv_term()\n```\n<<<R-R interval"
