    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」, I will use a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will define the word 「弟」 (otouto) and its standard pitch accent information within the script. The standard notation for pitch accent uses a number, where `[0]` represents the 'Heiban' pattern.\n2.  The script will analyze this information, identify that the pitch number `[0]` corresponds to the Heiban (平板) pattern.\n3.  Finally, the script will print a clear explanation of why 「弟」 is a Heiban word and identify the corresponding answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the pitch accent pattern for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_info = {\n        \"kanji\": \"弟\",\n        \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n        \"pitch_pattern_number\": 0,\n        \"morae_count\": 4\n    }\n\n    kanji = word_info[\"kanji\"]\n    reading = word_info[\"reading\"]\n    pitch_number = word_info[\"pitch_pattern_number\"]\n\n    # In Japanese pitch accent notation:\n    # [0] = Heiban (平板): Low-High-High-High...\n    # [1] = Atamadaka (頭高): High-Low-Low-Low...\n    # [2]...[N-1] = Nakadaka (中高): Pitch drops in the middle.\n    # [N] = Odaka (尾高): Pitch is high until the end, but drops on a following particle.\n\n    pattern_name = \"\"\n    answer_choice = \"\"\n\n    if pitch_number == 0:\n        pattern_name = \"Heiban (平板)\"\n        answer_choice = \"A\"\n        explanation = (\n            \"A pitch number of [0] indicates a Heiban (flat) pattern. \"\n            \"The pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), \"\n            \"and stays high for the rest of the word (うと).\"\n        )\n    else:\n        # This logic handles other cases, though not needed for this specific word.\n        if pitch_number == 1:\n            pattern_name = \"Atamadaka (頭高)\"\n            answer_choice = \"B\"\n        elif 1 < pitch_number < word_info[\"morae_count\"]:\n            pattern_name = \"Nakadaka (中高)\"\n            answer_choice = \"C\"\n        elif pitch_number == word_info[\"morae_count\"]:\n            pattern_name = \"Odaka (尾高)\"\n            answer_choice = \"D\"\n        explanation = \"The word's pitch number does not match Heiban.\"\n\n\n    print(f\"Analysis for the word: 「{kanji}」 ({reading})\")\n    print(f\"Standard pitch accent notation: [{pitch_number}]\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The pattern for 「{kanji}」 is {pattern_name}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to Answer Choice: {answer_choice}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
