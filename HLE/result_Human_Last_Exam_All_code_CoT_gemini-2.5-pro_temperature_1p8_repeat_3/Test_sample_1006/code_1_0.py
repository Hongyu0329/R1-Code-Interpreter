def solve_homeomorphism_classes():
    """
    This function determines the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
    with the given properties.

    Let X be a compact topological space with the following properties:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, \omega_1).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.

    Analysis:
    - Property (1) establishes that X is a compactification of the long ray R.
    - Property (2) is the universal mapping property that uniquely defines the
      Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted βR, up to homeomorphism.
      Any two compactifications with this property must be homeomorphic to each other.
    - Therefore, any space X satisfying these properties must be homeomorphic to βR.

    Conclusion:
    - All such spaces X belong to a single homeomorphism class, the class of βR.
    - Thus, the number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
