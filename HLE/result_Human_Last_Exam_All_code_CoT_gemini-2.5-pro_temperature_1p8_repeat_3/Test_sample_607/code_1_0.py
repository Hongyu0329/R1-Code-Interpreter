    Performs a linearized analysis of the Heavy-ball method around a
    non-stationary point to see where it might converge.
    
    This is an illustrative example based on a local Taylor expansion of the
    gradient. It shows that the fixed point of the linearized dynamics is not
    necessarily a point with zero gradient.

    # Let's consider a point x_star that is NOT stationary.
    # We analyze the behavior of the iterates x_k near x_star.
    # The gradient is linearized: nabla_f(x_k) approx g + H * (x_k - x_star)
    # where g = nabla_f(x_star) and H = nabla^2_f(x_star).

    # a fixed point if the dynamics are stable. The limit point of the
    # original sequence x_k will be x_lim.
    # Let's find this limit point x_lim.
    # At the limit point x_lim, the expected value of x_k, x_{k-1}, and x_{k+1} is x_lim.
    # The update rule at the limit becomes a fixed point equation for the *mean* behavior:
    # x_lim = x_lim + beta*(x_lim - x_lim) - gamma * nabla_f(x_lim)
    # --> This gives nabla_f(x_lim) = 0, which we already showed seems to be required.
    
    # However, the linearized analysis around x_star suggests convergence to a *different* point.

    # x_lim - x_star = -g / H
