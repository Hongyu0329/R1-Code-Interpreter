    This script solves the riddle by identifying the key attributes and connections.
    1.  The Pope in question is Paul II (15th century).
    2.  A shameful attribute for a Renaissance Pope would be a lack of education.
    3.  The word for this is "Illiterate".
    4.  The clue "'X' was written in the 1960s" refers to a book that popularized
        this historical accusation. "The Bad Popes" by E. R. Chamberlin, published
        in 1969, fits perfectly.
    5.  The riddle's final answer is "Illiterate". This script prints the
        components of the word as a pseudo-equation.
