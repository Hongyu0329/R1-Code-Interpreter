    Analyzes the options for implementing an online book selling system's logic
    based on the Domain Model pattern and identifies the inappropriate ones.

    - A. Logic in Controller: This is an anti-pattern (Anemic Domain Model). The controller should handle application flow, not business logic.
    - B. All logic in Order class: This creates a "God Object," violating the Single Responsibility Principle. The Order class shouldn't be responsible for customer history or book inventory.
    - C. Logic distributed to relevant classes (Customer, Book, Order): This is a good implementation of a rich Domain Model. Each class handles its own responsibilities.
    - D. Logic in a Domain Service: This is a valid and common pattern for orchestrating operations that involve multiple domain objects.
    - E. Logic divided between Order class and a Domain Service: This is a pragmatic and often ideal approach, combining rich entities with coordinating services.

    Therefore, the inappropriate options are A and B.
