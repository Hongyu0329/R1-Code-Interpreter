# Plan:
# 1. Define variables based on the problem's conditions. Let's use example values.
#    Let quantity q1 = 100 units.
#    Let price P = $20.
#    The condition is P = MC < AVC < ATC. So we need AVC > 20 and ATC > AVC.
#    Let AVC = $25.
#    Let ATC = $30.
#    This satisfies the condition 20 < 25 < 30.
#
# 2. Define the areas S, T, and H based on these values.
#    Area S = Total Revenue = P * q1
#    Area H = Total Cost = ATC * q1
#
# 3. Calculate the firm's profit or loss.
#    Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = S - H
#
# 4. Print the final result and the equation.

# Step 1: Define variables with example values
q1 = 100  # Output level
P = 20    # Market Price (and Marginal Cost at q1)
ATC = 30  # Average Total Cost at q1

print(f"Let's assume the following values based on the problem statement:")
print(f"Output Level (q1) = {q1}")
print(f"Market Price (P) = ${P}")
print(f"Average Total Cost (ATC) = ${ATC}")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Calculate the areas S (Total Revenue) and H (Total Cost)
S = P * q1
H = ATC * q1

print("Calculating the corresponding areas S and H:")
print(f"Area S (Total Revenue) = P * q1 = ${P} * {q1} = ${S}")
print(f"Area H (Total Cost) = ATC * q1 = ${ATC} * {q1} = ${H}")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Calculate the profit or loss
profit_or_loss = S - H

# Step 4: Print the final calculation for profit
print("The firm's profit is calculated as Total Revenue (S) - Total Cost (H).")
print("Final Equation: Profit = S - H")
print(f"Calculation: Profit = ${S} - ${H} = ${profit_or_loss}")

if profit_or_loss < 0:
    print("\nSince the result is negative, the firm is experiencing a loss.")
    print(f"The magnitude of the loss is represented by the area H - S, which is ${-profit_or_loss}.")
