    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the system and find equilibrium points:** A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. These are often the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points. First, I will find the equilibrium points of the system by setting $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points:** I will compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate it at each equilibrium point. By analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at each point, I can classify them as nodes, saddles, etc. This will identify the crucial saddle point(s).\n3.  **Identify the separatrix:** The separatrix is typically the stable or unstable manifold of a saddle point. I will find the equation for the manifold associated with the saddle point.\n4.  **Propose and verify a candidate solution:** The differential equation for the trajectories in the phase plane ($\\frac{dd}{du}$) is complex. I will hypothesize a simple functional form for the separatrix, $d=f(u)$. The function must pass through the saddle point and have the correct slope there (given by the corresponding eigenvector).\n5.  **Test the candidate:** I will substitute the candidate solution into the original system of differential equations to verify that it represents an actual trajectory (an invariant manifold).\n6.  **Present the final equation:** Once the separatrix equation is confirmed, I will write a Python script to print the equation, making sure to explicitly output all the numbers involved in the final equation as requested.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Equilibrium Points and Classification**\n\nThe system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1 - u)$\n$u'(t) = u^2(u - 1)$\n\nSetting $u'(t)=0$ gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n- If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2=0$, so $d=0$. Point: $(0, 0)$.\n- If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, so $2d(d+1)=0$, giving $d=0$ or $d=-1$. Points: $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system is $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n- At $(1, 0)$: $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so this is an **unstable node**.\n- At $(1, -1)$: $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. They have opposite signs, so this is a **saddle point**.\n- At $(0,0)$: The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the point is degenerate and linearization is not conclusive.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Identifying the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$, as this manifold acts as a boundary separating trajectories with different fates. The unstable manifold is tangent to the eigenvector corresponding to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$. The eigenvector is $v_1 = (1, -2)^T$, meaning the separatrix has a slope of $dd/du = -2$ at the point $(1, -1)$.\n\nLet's hypothesize a simple polynomial curve for the separatrix: $d = f(u)$.\nA good candidate should satisfy:\n1. $f(1) = -1$ (passes through the saddle point).\n2. $f'(1) = -2$ (has the correct slope).\n\nConsider the function $d = -u^2$.\n1. $d(1) = -1^2 = -1$. (Satisfied)\n2. $d'(u) = -2u$, so $d'(1) = -2$. (Satisfied)\nThis makes $d=-u^2$ a very strong candidate.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\nLet's check if the curve $d(t) = -(u(t))^2$ is a trajectory of the system. If it is, then the time derivative of the left side must equal the right side of the first ODE when we substitute $d=-u^2$.\n\nThe time derivative is $\\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u'(t) = -2u \\cdot (u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, substitute $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first ODE:\n$2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1 - u)$\n$= 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n$= (-2)u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nThe expressions match. Therefore, $d=-u^2$ is an exact solution curve (invariant manifold) for the system. Since it passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$, it is indeed the separatrix.\n\n**Step 6: Present the Final Equation**\nThe following Python code will print the equation for the found separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function states the equation of the separatrix for the given system of differential equations.\n    The separatrix was found analytically to be d = -u^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The equation of the separatrix is d = -1 * u^2.\n    # The numbers in this equation are -1 (coefficient) and 2 (power).\n    \n    d_coeff_numerator = -1\n    d_coeff_denominator = 1\n    \n    u_power_numerator = 2\n    u_power_denominator = 1\n\n    # We print the numbers that define the equation.\n    # We can express the separatrix as d = coefficient * u^power.\n    coefficient = d_coeff_numerator / d_coeff_denominator\n    power = u_power_numerator / u_power_denominator\n\n    print(\"The equation for the separatrix is:\")\n    \n    # We build the string for the equation \"d = -1 * u^2\"\n    # and explicitly use the numbers in the print statement.\n    print(f\"d = {int(coefficient)} * u^{int(power)}\")\n    \nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
