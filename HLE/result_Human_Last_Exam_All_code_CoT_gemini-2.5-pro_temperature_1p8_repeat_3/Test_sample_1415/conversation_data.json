    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to evaluate is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1. This integral is of the form ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx.\n2.  **Apply Integration Formula:** The antiderivative of f'(x)/f(x) is ln|f(x)|. Therefore, the definite integral from a to b is [ln|f(x)|] from a to b, which equals ln|f(b)| - ln|f(a)|. In our case, f(x) = F₃(x), a = 0, and b = 1. So, the value of the integral V is ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    *   F₀(0) = 0\n    *   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n    *   F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n    *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    *   F₀(1) = 1\n    *   F₁(1) = sin(1)\n    *   F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n    *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n5.  **Evaluate the Final Expression:**\n    *   Since F₃(x) is positive for x in [0, 1], we can remove the absolute value.\n    *   The value V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n    *   I will write a Python script to compute this value.\n6.  **Report the Final Answer:** The final step is to calculate 10000 * V and find the closest integer to it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral and calculates the final requested value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the functions based on the problem description.\n    # F₀(x) = x\n    # F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n    # F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n    # F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n    # Step 2: The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx is ln|F₃(x)|.\n    # The definite integral from 0 to 1 is V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|.\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate F₃(1).\n    f0_1 = 1\n    f1_1 = math.sin(f0_1)\n    f2_1 = math.exp(f1_1)\n    f3_1 = math.log(1 + f2_1)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate F₃(0).\n    f0_0 = 0\n    f1_0 = math.sin(f0_0)\n    f2_0 = math.exp(f1_0)\n    f3_0 = math.log(1 + f2_0)\n    \n    # Step 5: Evaluate the integral V.\n    # As F₃(x) > 0 for x in [0, 1], the absolute value is not needed.\n    # V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    V = math.log(f3_1) - math.log(f3_0)\n\n    # Step 6: Print the components of the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The integral is evaluated as V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\n    print(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_1}\")\n    print(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = {f3_0}\")\n    print(f\"So, V = ln({f3_1}) - ln({f3_0})\")\n    print(f\"The value of the integral V is: {V}\")\n    \n    # Step 7: Calculate 10000 * V and find the closest integer.\n    final_value = 10000 * V\n    closest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe value of 10000 * V is: {final_value}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {closest_integer}\")\n    \n    return closest_integer\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    answer = solve_integral()\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{answer}>>>\")\n```"
