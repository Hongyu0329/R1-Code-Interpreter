    "My plan is to determine the \"worst\" suited Jack (a Jack and another suited card) that should be open-raised from the button position in a standard 100 big blind (BB) cash game. Here is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Understand the Context**: The scenario is specific: 100BB deep, rake-free cash game, opening from the button (BTN). The button is the most profitable position in poker, allowing for a very wide and aggressive opening range. \"Rake-free\" simplifies the calculation slightly, making more marginal hands profitable.\n\n2.  **Define \"Worst\"**: In this context, \"worst\" means the hand with the lowest expected value (EV) that is still considered a profitable, standard open-raise according to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles. We are looking for the hand at the bottom of the suited Jack portion of the opening range.\n\n3.  **Analyze Suited Jacks (Jxs)**: The value of a suited hand like Jxs comes from its flush potential and its high card/straight potential.\n    *   The strength of the hand within the Jxs category is determined by the rank of the second card (the kicker).\n    *   A higher kicker (like in JTs or J9s) provides better straight potential (e.g., JTs can make a Royal Flush, a straight, etc.) and is less likely to be dominated.\n    *   A lower kicker (like in J3s or J2s) has very limited straight potential and a weak high-card value if a pair of Jacks is hit.\n\n4.  **Consult GTO Ranges**: Based on standard GTO opening charts for a 100BB BTN open, players should raise an extremely wide range of hands, often around 40-50%. This range typically includes *all* suited Jacks, from JTs down to J2s.\n\n5.  **Identify the Bottom of the Range**: Following the logic from step 3, the strength of suited Jacks descends as the kicker gets lower: JTs > J9s > J8s ... > J3s > J2s. Therefore, J2s is the weakest (lowest EV) hand in the Jxs category. Since GTO strategy considers all suited Jacks to be profitable opens from the button, J2s is the \"worst\" one that you should still open.\n\n6.  **Construct the Code**: The Python script will print out this logic and then declare the final hand, `J2s`, as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button based on GTO principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Poker hand in question: Suited Jacks (Jxs)\n    # The value of these hands decreases as the second card (kicker) gets lower.\n    # JTs (Jack-Ten suited) is the strongest.\n    # J2s (Jack-Two suited) is the weakest.\n\n    best_kicker = 10\n    worst_kicker = 2\n\n    # In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the button's opening range is very wide.\n    # According to standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) charts, it is profitable to\n    # open-raise all suited Jacks from the button.\n    # The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest profitability that is\n    # still considered a standard raise.\n\n    worst_hand = f\"J{worst_kicker}s\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the Button's opening range for suited Jacks (Jxs).\")\n    print(\"The strength of a suited Jack is determined by its second card, or 'kicker'.\")\n    print(f\"The range of suited Jacks goes from J{best_kicker}s (strongest) down to J{worst_kicker}s (weakest).\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on standard GTO strategy, all suited Jacks are profitable to open-raise from the button.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the 'worst' hand in this category that you should still open is the one with the lowest kicker.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe answer is: {worst_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_open()\n<<<J2s>>>\n```"
