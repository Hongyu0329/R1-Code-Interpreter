    "In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the only Nash Equilibrium is for both players to defect, leading to a suboptimal outcome of (1,1). However, when the game is quantized, new possibilities emerge. By entangling the players' states before they choose their strategies, it's possible to reach a new equilibrium point that resolves the dilemma.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Setup the Quantum Game:** We will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) framework.\n    *   **Initial State:** The game starts with an entangled state `|ψ_initial> = J|CC>`, where `|C>` and `|D>` are the basis states for Cooperate and Defect, and `J` is a maximally entangling operator.\n    *   **Payoff Matrix:** The payoffs are `(R,S,T,P)` for outcomes `(CC, CD, DC, DD)`. Here, R=5 (reward), S=0 (sucker), T=7 (temptation), and P=1 (punishment).\n    *   **Strategies:** Players' strategies are unitary operators. The classical strategies 'Cooperate' and 'Defect' have quantum equivalents, and a new \"miracle move\" `Q` exists.\n        *   `C` (Cooperate) = Identity matrix.\n        *   `D` (Defect) = Pauli-X matrix (`σ_x`) multiplied by `i`.\n        *   `Q` (Quantum) = Pauli-Z matrix (`σ_z`) multiplied by `i`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Equilibrium Payoff:** We will demonstrate that when both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`, the outcome is equivalent to mutual cooperation (C, C), yielding a payoff of (5, 5).\n\n3.  **Verify the Equilibrium:** A Nash Equilibrium requires that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. We will show that if Player A plays `Q`, Player B's payoff will decrease if they switch to either `C` or `D`.\n\n4.  **Python Implementation:** The code will use `numpy` to perform the quantum calculations, verifying the payoffs for the equilibrium strategy `(Q,Q)` and for a deviation `(Q,D)`. It will print the full payoff calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the equilibrium point for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff values from the matrix\n    # (C, C) -> (R, R)\n    # (C, D) -> (S, T)\n    # (D, C) -> (T, S)\n    # (D, D) -> (P, P)\n    R, S, T, P = 5, 0, 7, 1\n\n    # Basis states: |C> = [1, 0], |D> = [0, 1]\n    C = np.array([[1], [0]])\n    D = np.array([[0], [1]])\n\n    # Basis states for the 2-qubit system\n    CC = np.kron(C, C)\n    CD = np.kron(C, D)\n    DC = np.kron(D, C)\n    DD = np.kron(D, D)\n\n    # Pauli Matrices\n    I = np.identity(2)\n    sigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n    sigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n    # Entangling operator J and its conjugate transpose J_dag\n    J = (1 / np.sqrt(2)) * (np.kron(I, I) + 1j * np.kron(sigma_x, sigma_x))\n    J_dag = J.conj().T\n\n    # Initial entangled state\n    psi_initial = J @ CC\n\n    # Strategy Operators\n    C_op = I          # Cooperate\n    D_op = 1j * sigma_x # Defect\n    Q_op = 1j * sigma_z # Quantum strategy\n\n    print(\"--- Finding the Quantum Equilibrium ---\")\n\n    # Case 1: Both players choose the Quantum strategy (Q, Q)\n    U_A_eq = Q_op\n    U_B_eq = Q_op\n\n    # Combined strategy operator\n    U_eq = np.kron(U_A_eq, U_B_eq)\n\n    # Calculate final state\n    psi_final_eq = J_dag @ U_eq @ psi_initial\n\n    # Calculate probabilities of classical outcomes\n    p_cc_eq = np.abs(psi_final_eq.T @ CC)**2\n    p_cd_eq = np.abs(psi_final_eq.T @ CD)**2\n    p_dc_eq = np.abs(psi_final_eq.T @ DC)**2\n    p_dd_eq = np.abs(psi_final_eq.T @ DD)**2\n\n    # Calculate payoffs\n    payoff_A_eq = p_cc_eq * R + p_cd_eq * S + p_dc_eq * T + p_dd_eq * P\n    payoff_B_eq = p_cc_eq * R + p_cd_eq * T + p_dc_eq * S + p_dd_eq * P\n    \n    print(\"\\nStrategy Profile: (Quantum, Quantum)\")\n    print(f\"Probabilities: P(CC)={p_cc_eq[0][0]:.2f}, P(CD)={p_cd_eq[0][0]:.2f}, P(DC)={p_dc_eq[0][0]:.2f}, P(DD)={p_dd_eq[0][0]:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Player A Payoff = {p_cc_eq[0][0]:.2f}*{R} + {p_cd_eq[0][0]:.2f}*{S} + {p_dc_eq[0][0]:.2f}*{T} + {p_dd_eq[0][0]:.2f}*{P} = {payoff_A_eq[0][0]:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Player B Payoff = {p_cc_eq[0][0]:.2f}*{R} + {p_cd_eq[0][0]:.2f}*{T} + {p_dc_eq[0][0]:.2f}*{S} + {p_dd_eq[0][0]:.2f}*{P} = {payoff_B_eq[0][0]:.2f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Verifying the Equilibrium (Checking for Deviations) ---\")\n    \n    # Case 2: Player A plays Q, Player B deviates to D\n    U_A_dev = Q_op\n    U_B_dev = D_op\n    U_dev = np.kron(U_A_dev, U_B_dev)\n    psi_final_dev = J_dag @ U_dev @ psi_initial\n\n    p_cc_dev = np.abs(psi_final_dev.T @ CC)**2\n    p_cd_dev = np.abs(psi_final_dev.T @ CD)**2\n    p_dc_dev = np.abs(psi_final_dev.T @ DC)**2\n    p_dd_dev = np.abs(psi_final_dev.T @ DD)**2\n\n    payoff_A_dev = p_cc_dev * R + p_cd_dev * S + p_dc_dev * T + p_dd_dev * P\n    payoff_B_dev = p_cc_dev * R + p_cd_dev * T + p_dc_dev * S + p_dd_dev * P\n\n    print(\"\\nStrategy Profile: (Quantum, Defect)\")\n    print(f\"Probabilities: P(CC)={p_cc_dev[0][0]:.2f}, P(CD)={p_cd_dev[0][0]:.2f}, P(DC)={p_dc_dev[0][0]:.2f}, P(DD)={p_dd_dev[0][0]:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Player A Payoff = {p_cc_dev[0][0]:.2f}*{R} + {p_cd_dev[0][0]:.2f}*{S} + {p_dc_dev[0][0]:.2f}*{T} + {p_dd_dev[0][0]:.2f}*{P} = {payoff_A_dev[0][0]:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Player B Payoff = {p_cc_dev[0][0]:.2f}*{R} + {p_cd_dev[0][0]:.2f}*{T} + {p_dc_dev[0][0]:.2f}*{S} + {p_dd_dev[0][0]:.2f}*{P} = {payoff_B_dev[0][0]:.2f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"Player B's payoff drops from {payoff_B_eq[0][0]:.2f} to {payoff_B_dev[0][0]:.2f} upon unilaterally defecting.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, there is no incentive to deviate from the (Quantum, Quantum) strategy.\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium point for the quantum game is a payoff of (5, 5), which resolves the dilemma.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n    # The equilibrium point is the payoff pair achieved at equilibrium.\n    print(\"\\n<<< (5, 5) >>>\")\n\n```"
