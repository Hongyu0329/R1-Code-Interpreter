    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry**: The molecule has a central benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The pattern of substitution (three identical large groups at 1,3,5 and three identical methyl groups at 2,4,6) gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This means we only need to count the number of unique proton signals for one-third of the molecule (one large substituent arm and one methyl group on the central ring).\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Ring**: The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n3.  **Count Signals from One Substituent Arm**: An \"arm\" consists of the `-CH2-` linker and the large chiral group, which is a camphor-derived pyrazole moiety.\n    *   **-CH2- linker**: The two protons on the methylene linker are attached to a chiral center (the camphor-pyrazole group). This makes them diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent, giving rise to two separate signals.\n    *   **Camphor-pyrazole moiety**: This is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system. We must count every unique proton environment within this group:\n        *   There is one proton on the pyrazole ring.\n        *   The camphor-like skeleton has one proton at a bridgehead (C4).\n        *   There are two methylene (`-CH2-`) groups (at C5 and C6). The two protons within each group are non-equivalent (endo/exo), and the two groups are not equivalent to each other. This gives 2 + 2 = 4 signals.\n        *   There is a methyl group at another bridgehead (C1). This gives one signal.\n        *   There is a gem-dimethyl group on the bridge carbon (C7). These two methyl groups are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives two signals.\n        *   In total, the camphor-pyrazole group contributes 1 (pyrazole H) + 1 (bridgehead H) + 4 (CH2 groups) + 1 (C1-Me) + 2 (C7-Me2) = 9 signals.\n4.  **Sum All Signals**: We add the signals from the central ring's methyl groups and one full substituent arm.\n\nThe following Python code implements this counting logic to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the expected number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum\n# of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n# based on its molecular symmetry and structure.\n\n# The molecule possesses C3 rotational symmetry.
