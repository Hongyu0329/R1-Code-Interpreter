    "Yes, it does follow that $f=0$.\n\n### Plan\n\nMy plan is to use the properties of the Fourier transform on Schwartz functions. The strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Fourier Transform:** Define the Fourier transform of the function $f(x)$, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$. Since $f$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function and therefore infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$).\n2.  **Derivatives of the Fourier Transform:** I will show that the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ evaluated at $\\xi=0$ are directly related to the moments of $f(x)$ (the integrals of $x^k f(x)$).\n3.  **Applying the Condition:** Using the given condition that all moments are zero, I will deduce that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n4.  **Analyticity:** A key property of Schwartz functions is that their Fourier transforms are analytic. An analytic function whose value and all derivatives are zero at a point must be the zero function everywhere. Therefore, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be identically zero.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Finally, by the Fourier Inversion Theorem, if the Fourier transform of a function is zero, the function itself must be zero. This will lead to the conclusion that $f(x)=0$.\n\n### Mathematical Argument\n\nLet the Fourier transform of $f(x)$ be $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$.\n\nThe $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ can be computed by differentiating under the integral sign (which is permissible because $f$ is a Schwartz function):\n$\\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{\\partial^k}{\\partial\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$.\n\nEvaluating this at $\\xi = 0$, we get:\n$\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx$.\n\nWe are given that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This means that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nSince $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, it is analytic. Its Taylor series expansion around $\\xi=0$ is given by:\n$\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k$.\n\nSince every coefficient $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)$ is zero, the series is identically zero. Thus, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$.\n\nBy the Fourier Inversion Theorem, $f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} d\\xi$. Since $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$, this integral is zero, which implies $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\n### Demonstration Code\n\nThe following Python code doesn't prove the theorem but demonstrates its contrapositive: if a Schwartz function is non-zero, then at least one of its moments must be non-zero. We will use the non-zero Gaussian function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ and compute its first few moments.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef demonstrate_moments():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that for a non-zero Schwartz function,\n    like the Gaussian f(x) = exp(-x**2), the moments are not all zero.\n    This supports the theorem that if all moments are zero, the function\n    must be the zero function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable and the function\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = sympy.exp(-x**2)\n\n    print(f\"Demonstration using the non-zero Schwartz function: f(x) = {f}\")\n    print(\"The k-th moment is M_k = integral(x**k * f(x) dx) from -oo to +oo.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Calculate and print moments for k = 0 to 7\n    for k in range(8):\n        # The term inside the integral\n        integrand = x**k * f\n\n        # Perform the definite symbolic integration from -oo to +oo\n        moment_value = sympy.integrate(integrand, (x, -sympy.oo, sympy.oo))\n\n        # Output the equation for the calculated moment\n        # We output each number involved in the calculation as requested\n        print(f\"Equation for k={k}: M_{k} = Integral(x**{k} * exp(-x**2), x=-oo..oo) = {moment_value}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"As shown, the moments for even k are non-zero.\")\n    print(\"This is consistent with the theorem: a non-zero function must have non-zero moments.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    demonstrate_moments()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
