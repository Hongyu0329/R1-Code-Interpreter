    "The question is about music theory, specifically identifying a song by The Beatles with a unique opening chord progression. My plan is to:\n1.  Define the musical terms \"tonic\" (I) and \"minor fifth\" (v) chord to clarify the request.\n2.  Analyze the Beatles' catalog to find a song that matches this I -> v progression at the beginning.\n3.  The song \"Michelle\" is a prime candidate. I'll verify its key and opening chords. The song's intro is in the key of F, and it starts with an F major chord (the tonic) and moves immediately to a C minor chord. C is the fifth note in the F major scale, so a C minor chord is the \"minor fifth\" (v).\n4.  Construct a Python script that will print this finding as the answer, satisfying the request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies a Beatles song based on its opening chord progression.\n\n    The request asks for a song that starts with a jump from the tonic chord (I)\n    to the minor fifth chord (v).\n\n    Analysis:\n    1. Tonic Chord (I): The 'home' chord of the song's key.\n    2. Minor Fifth Chord (v): In a major key, the chord built on the fifth degree\n       of the scale is typically major (V). A minor fifth (v) is a less common,\n       more harmonically interesting choice.\n    3. The Song: \"Michelle\" from the album Rubber Soul (1965).\n    4. The Progression: The intro to \"Michelle\" is in the key of F.\n       - The first chord is F major, which is the tonic (I) of the key of F.\n       - The second chord is C minor. C is the fifth note of the F major scale.\n         Therefore, C minor is the minor fifth (v) chord.\n\n    The progression is F (I) -> Cmin (v), which matches the user's description perfectly.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major (I)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    print(f\"The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"Key of the introduction: {key}\")\n    print(f\"Tonic Chord (I): {tonic_chord.split(' ')[0]}\")\n    print(f\"Minor Fifth Chord (v): {minor_fifth_chord.split(' ')[0]} {minor_fifth_chord.split(' ')[1]}\")\n\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
