    "To answer this question, I will perform a programmatic search for the binding affinity of the specified compound and protein. The long chemical name provided corresponds to a known, potent, and selective CDK7 inhibitor called **SY-5609**. I will use this common name to query the ChEMBL database, a large, public repository of bioactive drug-like molecules.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the `chembl_webresource_client` Python library to connect to the ChEMBL database.\n2.  I will search for the molecule \"SY-5609\" to obtain its unique ChEMBL ID.\n3.  I will search for the protein target \"Cyclin-dependent kinase 7\" (Homo sapiens) to get its ChEMBL ID.\n4.  Using these IDs, I will query the database for bioactivity data, specifically looking for IC50 values, which are a common measure of a compound's potency.\n5.  I will process the results, find a representative IC50 value, and print it.\n6.  Finally, I will compare this value to the given answer choices to determine the correct range.\n\n```python\n# First, you may need to install the ChEMBL client library.
