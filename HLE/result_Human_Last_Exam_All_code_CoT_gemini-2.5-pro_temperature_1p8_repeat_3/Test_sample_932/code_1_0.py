def find_unlikely_tribes():

    Identifies the indices of insect tribes whose immatures are unlikely to be collected
    using a beat-sheet method based on their life history.

    - Apis (1): Larvae in hives, not on foliage. -> Unlikely.
    - Melipotini (2): Caterpillars on foliage. -> Likely.
    - Eupholini (3): Larvae are internal plant borers. -> Unlikely.
    - Acritini (4): Larvae in decaying matter, not on plants. -> Unlikely.
    - Oxyptilini (5): Many are internal borers, but some are external. -> Less likely, but possible.
    - Dictyophorini (6): Nymphs on foliage. -> Likely.
    - Acanthocerini (7): Larvae in rotting wood. -> Unlikely.
