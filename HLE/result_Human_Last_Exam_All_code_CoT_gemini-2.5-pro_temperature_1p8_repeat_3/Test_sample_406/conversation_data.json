    "Of course. This is a theoretical question from a field of mathematics known as fixed-point theory. I will outline the standard conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a tripled fixed point.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Clarify Function Definitions:** The prompt provides function signatures `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. The latter two appear to have typos. I will proceed by using the standard definitions from the literature on tripled fixed points, which typically involve three distinct functions (F, G, H) and permutations of the three spaces (X, Y, Z).\n2.  **Define a Tripled Fixed Point:** I will state the system of equations that a point (x, y, z) must satisfy to be considered a tripled fixed point.\n3.  **State the Existence Conditions:** I will present the main theorem's conditions, which are based on an extension of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem. This involves:\n    *   The spaces X, Y, and Z being complete metric spaces.\n    *   The functions F, G, and H satisfying a set of contraction-type inequalities.\n    *   A final condition on the sum of the contraction constants.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this explanation in a clear, step-by-step format, fulfilling the request to provide an answer via a code block.\n\n```python\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the definition and the conditions for the existence and\n    uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point, based on standard theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- 1.
