    "This is a fun word puzzle! The key is not in ballet history, but in the numbers hidden within the text of the question itself. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Extract the numbers:** I will identify all the numerical values mentioned in the prompt.\n    *   From the year \"2008\", I will take the digits: 2, 0, 0, and 8.\n    *   From the phrase \"single-turn\", I will take the number 1.\n    *   From the phrase \"fifth position\", I will take the number 5.\n    *   From \"Act l\", I will interpret \"l\" as the Roman numeral for 1.\n2.  **Formulate the equation:** The puzzle is solved by adding all of these extracted numbers together.\n3.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script that defines these numbers, calculates their sum, and then prints the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Plan: Solve the word puzzle by extracting numbers from the text and summing them up.\n\n# 1. Extract the numbers from the text.\n# The year is 2008. We will use its individual digits.\nyear = 2008\nyear_digits = [int(digit) for digit in str(year)] # This gives [2, 0, 0, 8]\n\n# \"single-turn\" implies the number 1.\nturn_count = 1\n\n# \"fifth position\" implies the number 5.\nposition_number = 5\n\n# \"Act l\" implies the number 1.\nact_number = 1\n\n# 2. Sum all the extracted numbers.\ntotal_sum = sum(year_digits) + turn_count + position_number + act_number\n\n# 3. Print the full equation showing each number.\n# We build a list of all the numbers we are adding.\nall_numbers = year_digits + [turn_count, position_number, act_number]\n\n# We create the string for the equation.\nequation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, all_numbers))\n\n# 4. Print the final result.\nprint(f\"The final equation is: {equation_str} = {total_sum}\")\n```\n<<<17>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
