    This function explains and prints the solution to the topology problem.
    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
    of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.
    
    The solution is derived from established theorems in point-set topology,
    not from a direct computation.
    
    1. A theorem states this collection can never be empty, so the minimum is >= 1.
    2. A known construction provides an example of a continuum where this
       collection has exactly one member.
    
    Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 1.
