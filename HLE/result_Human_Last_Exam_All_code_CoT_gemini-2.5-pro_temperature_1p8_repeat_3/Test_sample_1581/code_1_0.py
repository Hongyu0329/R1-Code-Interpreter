# The problem is to find the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a compact
# connected metric space X, given that its n-th configuration space F_n(X) is
# disconnected for some n >= 2.

# Step 1: Test a simple candidate space, X = [0, 1].
# X is a compact, connected metric space.
# For n=2, the configuration space is F_2([0, 1]) = {(x, y) in [0, 1]^2 | x != y}.
# This space is disconnected because it's the disjoint union of two non-empty open sets:
# A = {(x, y) | x < y}
# B = {(x, y) | y < x}
# The linear ordering of the real numbers allows us to separate the space.
# A similar argument holds for any n >= 2, where there are n! connected components.
# So, the homeomorphism class of [0, 1] is one solution.

# Step 2: Consider other types of spaces.
# The connectedness of F_n(X) depends on the ability to continuously swap points
# without collision.
# - If X is a manifold of dimension >= 2 (like a sphere), it has enough "room"
#   for points to move around, and F_n(X) is connected.
# - If X is a graph (a 1D network of points and edges), F_n(X) is connected unless
#   the graph is just a simple interval. A loop or a junction point provides
#   alternative paths to avoid collisions.
# - If X is a more exotic space like the Warsaw circle (which is connected but not
#   path-connected), it can be shown that F_n(X) is connected. One way is to find a
#   dense connected subset in F_n(X), implying the whole space is connected.

# Step 3: Conclude from the analysis.
# The condition that F_n(X) is disconnected for a compact connected metric space X
# is a very strong condition that essentially forces X to be "1-dimensional and simple",
# lacking any loops or branch points. This precisely describes spaces that are
# homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].

# Therefore, there is only one such class of spaces.
number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1

# There are no calculations in this problem, just a final integer answer based on topological theorems.
# The code below prints the final result.
