    "This is a film trivia question. My plan is to identify the movie based on the distinctive scene described. The key elements are a teenager, a pink bike, and a head-on collision course with a vehicle. This combination points to a specific scene in a well-known 1980s horror film. I will write a Python script that prints the name of the film and a brief description of the scene to confirm the match.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies a movie based on a scene description and prints the answer.\n    The scene involves a teenager, a pink bike, and an oncoming vehicle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The movie is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge'. The year of release is 1985.\n    movie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\"\n    release_year = 1985\n\n    # Description of the specific scene. While the teenager isn't riding the bike himself,\n    # the scene is from his perspective and is a key moment in the film.\n    scene_description = (\n        f\"In the {release_year} film '{movie_title}', there is a \"\n        \"memorable dream sequence. In the dream, the teenage protagonist, Jesse Walsh, \"\n        \"watches in horror as two young girls ride a pink tricycle directly toward an \"\n        \"oncoming, driverless school bus.\"\n    )\n\n    print(scene_description)\n\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
