# A plan to find the number of internal adjunctions.
# 1. Deconstruct the definition of an adjunction in the given 2-category.
# 2. Use the triangle identities to find the conditions on the 1-morphisms F and G.
# 3. The conditions simplify to F and G being inverses of each other.
# 4. Conclude that the number of adjunctions is the number of invertible 3x3 matrices over F_11.
# 5. This number is the order of the general linear group GL(3, F_11).
# 6. Calculate the value using the formula for the order of GL(n, q).

# Parameters
q = 11
n = 3

# Calculate the terms
term1 = q**n - 1
term2 = q**n - q
term3 = q**n - q**2

# Calculate the total number of adjunctions
num_adjunctions = term1 * term2 * term3

# Print the result in the specified format
print(f"The number of adjunctions is the order of GL(3, F_11), which is calculated as follows:")
print(f"({q}^{n} - 1) * ({q}^{n} - {q}) * ({q}^{n} - {q}^2)")
print(f"= ({q**n} - 1) * ({q**n} - {q}) * ({q**n} - {q**2})")
print(f"= {term1} * {term2} * {term3}")
print(f"= {num_adjunctions}")
