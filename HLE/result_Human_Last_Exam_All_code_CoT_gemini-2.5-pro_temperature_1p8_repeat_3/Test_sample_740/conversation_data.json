    "To find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we first need to understand the nature of the equation.\n\nThe integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy K(x, y) u(y)`\nwhere the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\nAssuming `n` is a positive integer, the kernel can be expanded as a finite sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-j} y^j`\n\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, which means the integral equation can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations. The solution `u(x)` must be of the form of a polynomial of degree at most `n-1` plus a constant.\n\nLet `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j x^{n-1-j}`, where `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy`.\n\nBy substituting the form of `u(x)` into the definitions of `c_i`, we obtain a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `c₀, c₁, ..., c_{n-1}`:\n`c_i = 1/(i+1) + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j / (i+n-j)` for `i = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThis can be written in matrix form as:\n`(I - λA)c = b`\nwhere:\n- `c` is the column vector of unknowns `[c₀, c₁, ..., c_{n-1}]ᵀ`.\n- `b` is the column vector `[1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n- `I` is the `n x n` identity matrix.\n- `A` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `A_{ij} = 1/(i-j+n)` (using 0-based indexing `i, j = 0, ..., n-1`).\n\nA unique solution for `c` exists if the matrix `(I - λA)` is invertible, i.e., `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`.\nIf `det(I - λA) = 0`, the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. This occurs when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. Let `μ` be an eigenvalue of `A`, so `λ = 1/μ`.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for `λ = 1/μ`, the equation has no solution if the vector `b` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix `(I - λA)ᵀ`. This condition is generally satisfied for the given kernel. A key part of this involves showing that for any eigenfunction `w` of the adjoint operator, its integral `∫₀¹ w(x) dx` is non-zero. This holds for the principal eigenfunction due to the positivity of the kernel, and is expected to hold for all eigenfunctions.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the eigenvalues `μ` of the matrix `A` and then calculating the corresponding values of `λ = 1/μ`. Since `n` is not specified, I will provide a Python script that calculates these values of `λ` for a given integer `n`. As an example, the code is set for `n=4`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): A positive integer, the exponent in the kernel of the integral equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        print(\"Please provide a positive integer value for n.\")\n        return\n\n    # A_ij = 1 / (i - j + n) for i, j from 0 to n-1\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            A[i, j] = 1.0 / (i - j + n)\n\n    # Find the eigenvalues of matrix A.\n    # The characteristic values lambda are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues.\n    try:\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A)\n        \n        # Calculate lambda = 1 / mu for each eigenvalue mu\n        # Check for non-zero eigenvalues to avoid division by zero.\n        lambdas = [1/mu for mu in eigenvalues if abs(mu) > 1e-9]\n\n        print(f\"For n = {n}, the matrix A is:\")\n        print(A)\n        print(\"\\nThe eigenvalues (mu) of A are:\")\n        print(eigenvalues)\n        print(\"\\nThe values of lambda for which the equation has no solution are:\")\n        for l in lambdas:\n            print(l)\n\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(f\"Could not compute eigenvalues for n = {n}.\")\n\n\n# You can set the integer value of 'n' here.\n# For example, let's solve for n = 4.\nn = 4\nsolve_for_lambda(n)\n\n```"
