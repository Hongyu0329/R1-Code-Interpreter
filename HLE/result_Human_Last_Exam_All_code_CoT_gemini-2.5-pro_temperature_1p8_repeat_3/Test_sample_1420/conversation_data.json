    "Of course. Here is the explanation and the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The problem requires using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a cornerstone of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory, to find a critical exponent.\n2.  **State the relevant formula:** The specific heat exponent `α` for a general n-vector model (a class of models that includes the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models) can be calculated to the first order in `ϵ` using the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n3.  **Define the parameters:**\n    *   `n` is the number of components of the order parameter. As the model is not specified, I will use the most fundamental case: the Ising model, where `n = 1`.\n    *   `ϵ` is the expansion parameter, defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n    *   `d_c` is the upper critical dimension, which is `4` for this class of models.\n    *   `d` is the spatial dimension, given as `3`.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** I will write a Python script that substitutes these values into the formula (`n=1`, `d=3`, `d_c=4`, `ϵ=1`) and prints the full equation with the numbers, as well as the final numerical result.\n\nHere is the code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# This script calculates the specific heat exponent alpha using the first-order epsilon expansion.\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the parameters ---\n# Spatial dimension of the system\nd = 3\n# Upper critical dimension for the n-vector model\nd_c = 4\n# Number of components of the order parameter. We assume the Ising model (n=1).\nn = 1\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate epsilon ---\nepsilon = d_c - d\n\n# --- Step 3: Use the one-loop formula for alpha ---\n# The formula is α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n\nalpha_value = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n# --- Step 4: Print the calculation and result ---\nprint(f\"Calculation of the specific heat exponent α for d={d} using the ε-expansion.\")\nprint(\"The first-order formula for the n-vector model is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\nprint(f\"Assuming the Ising model (n={n}) and with ε = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}, we substitute the values.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n# The prompt requires showing the equation with each number.\nprint(f\"α = (4 - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + 8)) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n\n# Representing the result as a fraction and a float\nfinal_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator)\nprint(f\"α = {final_fraction.numerator}/{final_fraction.denominator}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {alpha_value:.4f}\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format for the system.\n# The system will extract this line.\nsys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{alpha_value:.4f}>>>\")\n```\n<<<0.1667>>>"
