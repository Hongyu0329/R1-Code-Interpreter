    "To find a(10), which is the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D grid (Manhattan lattice), we need to count all possible paths of length 10 starting from an origin that do not visit the same point more than once.\n\nThere is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). Therefore, for a relatively small number of steps like n=10, the problem can be solved by systematically counting all valid paths using a computational approach. I will use a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n\nHere is the plan for the algorithm:\n1.  **Define a recursive function**: This function will explore possible paths. It will take the number of remaining steps, the current position, and the set of visited points as input.\n2.  **Base Case**: If the number of remaining steps is zero, it means we have successfully constructed a valid 10-step walk, so we count it as one.\n3.  **Recursive Step**: From the current position, try to move one step in each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n4.  **Self-avoidance Check**: Before making a move, check if the new position has already been visited in the current path.\n5.  **Exploration**: If the new position is not visited, add it to the set of visited points and make a recursive call for the next step.\n6.  **Backtracking**: After a recursive call returns, remove the last-visited point. This allows the algorithm to explore other alternative paths.\n7.  **Summation**: The total number of walks will be the sum of walks found from all valid moves.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate a(10).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_self_avoiding_walks(steps_left, current_pos, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n    Args:\n        steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining to take.\n        current_pos (tuple): The current (x, y) coordinate of the walk.\n        visited (set): A set of (x, y) tuples representing the visited points\n                       in the current path.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks that can be formed from\n             the current state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have found one valid walk.\n    if steps_left == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    # Get the current coordinates.\n    x, y = current_pos\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the number of walks from this point.\n    walk_count = 0\n    \n    # Define the four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice.\n    moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)] # Up, Down, Right, Left\n\n    # Explore each possible move.\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n        \n        # Check if the next position has already been visited.\n        if next_pos not in visited:\n            # If not visited, explore this new path.\n            # 1. Add the new position to the visited set.\n            visited.add(next_pos)\n            \n            # 2. Recursively call the function for the next step.\n            walk_count += count_self_avoiding_walks(steps_left - 1, next_pos, visited)\n            \n            # 3. Backtrack: Remove the new position to explore other paths.\n            visited.remove(next_pos)\n            \n    return walk_count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of steps for the walk, n.\n    n = 10\n    \n    # A self-avoiding walk starts at an origin point, e.g., (0, 0).\n    start_position = (0, 0)\n    \n    # The set of visited points initially contains only the starting position.\n    # Using a set provides fast O(1) average time complexity for lookups.\n    initial_visited = {start_position}\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of walks by starting the recursion.\n    total_walks = count_self_avoiding_walks(n, start_position, initial_visited)\n    \n    print(\"Let a(n) be the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the number of walks is:\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {total_walks}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # For deep recursion, it might be necessary to increase the recursion limit,\n    # but n=10 is well within the default limit for Python.\n    # sys.setrecursionlimit(20000)\n    main()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
