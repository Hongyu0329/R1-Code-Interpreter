print("\nChirality Explanation:")
print("The original molecule, [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, was chiral. However, the chiral center at carbon-3 was destroyed during the first step (E2 elimination), which resulted in the formation of an achiral alkene. No new stereocenters were formed in the subsequent reactions. Therefore, the final product C, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is achiral.")
