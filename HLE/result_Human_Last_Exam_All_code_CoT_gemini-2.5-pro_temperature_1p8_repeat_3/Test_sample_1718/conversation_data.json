    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to consider its special symmetries.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  A Kähler manifold has a complex dimension, which we will call `m`. Its dimension as a real manifold is `n = 2m`.\n2.  For a general Riemannian manifold of real dimension `n`, the Riemann tensor has `n^2(n^2 - 1)/12` independent components.\n3.  However, a Kähler manifold has an underlying complex structure `J` that is compatible with the metric. This compatibility imposes strong additional symmetries on the Riemann tensor.\n4.  These additional symmetries significantly reduce the number of independent components. It can be shown that the curvature is completely determined by the components of the form `R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}`.\n5.  After accounting for all symmetries (including the Bianchi identities and the Kähler identities), the number of independent real components for a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is given by the elegant formula: `(m * (m + 1) / 2)^2`.\n6.  For example, for a complex dimension `m=1` (a real 2D surface), the formula gives `(1 * 2 / 2)^2 = 1^2 = 1`. For `m=2` (a real 4D manifold), it gives `(2 * 3 / 2)^2 = 3^2 = 9`, a reduction from the 20 components of a general 4-manifold.\n7.  The following Python code calculates the number of components for an example case of `m=4`, demonstrating each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Let m be the complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n# The real dimension is n = 2m.\n# We will choose an example value for m to demonstrate the calculation.\nm = 4\n\n# The number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor\n# on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m is given by the formula:\n# N = (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2\n\n# Let's calculate the result for our example value, m = 4.\n\n# Term inside the parenthesis\nterm_in_paren_numerator = m * (m + 1)\nterm_in_paren = term_in_paren_numerator // 2\n\n# Final result\nresult = term_in_paren ** 2\n\nprint(f\"The number of independent entries for a Kähler manifold of complex dimension 'm' is calculated with the formula:\")\nprint(\"N = (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2\")\nprint(f\"\\nFor an example manifold with complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n# The final code needs to output each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"N = ({m} * ({m} + 1) / 2)^2\")\nprint(f\"N = ({m} * {m + 1} / 2)^2\")\nprint(f\"N = ({term_in_paren_numerator} / 2)^2\")\nprint(f\"N = ({term_in_paren})^2\")\nprint(f\"N = {result}\")\n```\n<<<(m*(m+1)/2)**2>>>"
