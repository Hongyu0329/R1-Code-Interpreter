    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per atom:** We need to find out how many contracted basis functions the 6-31G basis set assigns to each type of atom.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 2 contracted functions. It splits the 1s valence orbital into an inner part (a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians) and an outer part (a single primitive Gaussian).\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 9 contracted functions. It has 1 function for the core (1s) electrons, and it splits the valence shell (2s and 2p) into two parts (inner and outer). The inner valence shell has 4 functions (one for 2s, three for 2p), and the outer valence shell also has 4 functions. This totals 1 (core) + 4 (inner) + 4 (outer) = 9 functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its respective number of basis functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8.\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# In the 6-31G basis set:\n# Each Carbon (C) atom is described by 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n# (1 for the core 1s orbital, 4 for the inner valence shell, 4 for the outer valence shell)\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n\n# Each Hydrogen (H) atom is described by 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n# (1 for the inner valence shell, 1 for the outer valence shell)\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the contribution from Carbon and Hydrogen atoms\ncarbon_contribution = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\nhydrogen_contribution = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions\ntotal_functions = carbon_contribution + hydrogen_contribution\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation\nprint(f\"The calculation for the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set is as follows:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"= ({carbon_contribution}) + ({hydrogen_contribution})\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
