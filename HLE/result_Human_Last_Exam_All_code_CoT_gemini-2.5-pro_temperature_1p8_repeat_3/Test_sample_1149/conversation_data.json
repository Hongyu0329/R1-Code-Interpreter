    "I will solve this task by first identifying the key information from paleontological research regarding the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*. The specific feature in question is the lacrimal recess. According to the scientific literature, particularly the detailed description of the skull, this recess contains two large openings (pneumatic foramina).\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that:\n1.  Stores the number of depressions in variables.\n2.  Calculates the total by adding them together to form a simple equation as requested.\n3.  Prints a descriptive sentence and the final equation to provide the answer.\n\n```python\n# The scientific paper by Sues et al. (2002), which describes the skull of Irritator challengeri,\n# notes that the lacrimal recess contains two large pneumatic foramina (depressions).\n# This script will represent this fact as a simple addition to fulfill the request.\n\n# Define each depression to form an equation.\nfirst_depression = 1\nsecond_depression = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions.\ntotal_depressions = first_depression + second_depression\n\n# Print the result in an equation format.\nprint(\"Based on paleontological findings, the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri can be determined.\")\nprint(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\nprint(f\"{first_depression} + {second_depression} = {total_depressions}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
