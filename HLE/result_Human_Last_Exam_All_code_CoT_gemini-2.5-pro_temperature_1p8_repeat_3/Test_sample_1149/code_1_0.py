# The scientific paper by Sues et al. (2002), which describes the skull of Irritator challengeri,
# notes that the lacrimal recess contains two large pneumatic foramina (depressions).
# This script will represent this fact as a simple addition to fulfill the request.

# Define each depression to form an equation.
first_depression = 1
second_depression = 1

# Calculate the total number of depressions.
total_depressions = first_depression + second_depression

# Print the result in an equation format.
print("Based on paleontological findings, the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri can be determined.")
print("The calculation is as follows:")
print(f"{first_depression} + {second_depression} = {total_depressions}")
print(f"\nThus, the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions.")
