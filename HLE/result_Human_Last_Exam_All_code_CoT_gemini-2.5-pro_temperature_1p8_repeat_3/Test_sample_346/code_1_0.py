# This script calculates the result of the derived formula: 27 * (1 + 2^27)

# Define the components of the final equation
val_a = 27
val_b = 1
val_c = 2
val_d = 27

# Calculate the term 2^27
power_result = val_c ** val_d

# Calculate the final result
final_result = val_a * (val_b + power_result)

# As requested, output the numbers in the final equation and the result
print(f"The calculation is: {val_a} * ({val_b} + {val_c}^{val_d})")
print(f"First, we calculate {val_c}^{val_d}, which is {power_result}.")
print(f"Then the expression becomes: {val_a} * ({val_b} + {power_result}).")
print(f"The final result of the calculation is: {final_result}")
