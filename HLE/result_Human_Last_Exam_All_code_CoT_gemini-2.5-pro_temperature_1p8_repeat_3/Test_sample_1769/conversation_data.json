    "The word \"sister\" in Modern English is an interesting case of linguistic borrowing. To figure out what the word would be without Norse influence, we need to find the original Old English word and trace its natural phonetic development over the centuries.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the current word's origin:** The modern word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word \"systir\". This was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers.\n2.  **Find the native Old English word:** Before the Norse influence, the word used by the Anglo-Saxons was \"sweostor\".\n3.  **Trace the evolution of \"sweostor\":** Without being replaced by the Norse \"systir\", the Old English \"sweostor\" would have evolved according to standard English sound changes. I will demonstrate this by comparing its parts to other Old English words that did evolve naturally.\n    *   The `sweo-` part can be compared to the Old English word for sword, `sweord`, which became \"sword\". This shows the `eo` vowel sound becomes `o` when it follows a `w`.\n    *   The unstressed `-or` ending can be compared to Old English `broþor` and `modor`, which became \"brother\" and \"mother\". This shows the `-or` reduces to `-er`.\n4.  **Construct the hypothetical word:** By applying these known sound changes, we can reconstruct the word that would have resulted from \"sweostor\".\n5.  **Code the demonstration:** I will write a Python script that prints this logical progression step-by-step to arrive at the final word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function traces the linguistic evolution of the Old English word\n    for \"sister\" to its hypothetical modern form.\n    \"\"\"\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    norse_equivalent = \"systir\"\n    modern_word = \"sister\"\n\n    print(f\"The Modern English word '{modern_word}' came from the Old Norse '{norse_equivalent}'.\")\n    print(f\"Without Norse influence, the native Old English word '{old_english_word}' would have evolved naturally.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Tracing the phonetic evolution of 'sweostor':\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the 'sweo-' prefix\n    print(\"1. The 'sweo-' prefix evolution:\")\n    print(\"   - Compare to Old English 'sweord' which became Modern English 'sword'.\")\n    print(\"   - Following this rule: 'sweo-' -> 'swo-'\")\n    part1 = \"swo\"\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the '-stor' suffix\n    print(\"\\n2. The '-or' ending evolution:\")\n    print(\"   - Compare to Old English 'broþor' which became Modern English 'brother'.\")\n    print(\"   - Following this rule, the ending '-or' -> '-er'.\")\n    print(\"   - Thus, '-stor' -> '-ster'.\")\n    part2 = \"ster\"\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the parts to form the final word\n    hypothetical_word = part1 + part2\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Combining the evolved parts '{part1}' and '{part2}' gives us the final word.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe logical evolution is: {old_english_word} -> {hypothetical_word}\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swoster>>>"
