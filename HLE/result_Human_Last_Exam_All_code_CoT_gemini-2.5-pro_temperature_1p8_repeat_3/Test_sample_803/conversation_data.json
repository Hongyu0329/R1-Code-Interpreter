    "This is a problem in abstract algebra, specifically in the domain of finite group theory. To solve this, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question**: First, I will break down the user's question into its core components. This involves understanding the definitions of a \"product-free set,\" a \"maximal by inclusion product-free set,\" and a \"filled group.\" The group structure is specified as being nonabelian and of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime.\n\n2.  **Structural Analysis of the Group**: I will analyze the structure of any group `G` of order `2q^m`. Using Sylow's theorems, such a group can be described as a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ C₂`, where `Q` is the normal Sylow `q`-subgroup of order `q^m` and `C₂` is a Sylow 2-subgroup. The nonabelian property puts a constraint on this semidirect product.\n\n3.  **Apply Characterization of Filled Groups**: I will use a known theorem from group theory that provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite soluble group to be \"filled.\" A group of order `p^a q^b` is always soluble (Burnside's Theorem), so this theorem is applicable. The theorem states that a soluble group is filled if and only if it does not possess certain groups as homomorphic images (quotients).\n\n4.  **Connect Group Structure to the Filled Condition**: I will translate the condition from the theorem into a specific structural requirement for our group `G = Q ⋊ C₂`. This will involve analyzing the commutator subgroup `G'` and the largest abelian quotient `G/G'`.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, I will precisely describe the family of groups that satisfy all the given conditions. This description will constitute the answer to \"What are the nonabelian filled groups...?\".\n\n6.  **Provide a Python Script**: Finally, I will encapsulate this theoretical answer within a Python script. The script will not perform complex algebraic computations but will use `print` statements to clearly present the derived characterization of the groups, along with illustrative examples, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the solution to the group theory question about nonabelian filled groups.\n    It prints the theoretical characterization of these groups along with examples.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are characterized as follows:\\n\")\n    print(\"A group G is a nonabelian filled group of order 2q^m if and only if it can be expressed as a semidirect product:\")\n    print(\"\\n    G = Q \\u22ca C\\u2082\\n\")\n    print(\"where:\\n\")\n    print(f\"1.
