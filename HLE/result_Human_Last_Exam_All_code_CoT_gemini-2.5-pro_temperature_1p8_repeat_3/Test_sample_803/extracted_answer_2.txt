The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m` are precisely the groups `G` that can be expressed as a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ C₂`, where: (1) `Q` is a group of order `q^m`; (2) `C₂` is the cyclic group of order 2; and (3) the semidirect product is defined by a non-trivial automorphism `α` of `Q` whose induced action on the abelianization `Q/Q'` is the inversion map (i.e., for any `g` in `Q`, the product `α(g)g` lies in the commutator subgroup `Q'`).
