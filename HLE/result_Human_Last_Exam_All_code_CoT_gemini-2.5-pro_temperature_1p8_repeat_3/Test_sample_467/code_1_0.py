# Step 1: Define the problem variables.
# The Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
# We need to find the number of poles of g(z).
z = sympy.Symbol('z')
denominator = z**3 + 2

# Step 2: Explain the method for finding the number of poles.
# The number of poles of g(z) is the number of roots of the denominator, z^3 + 2 = 0.
# By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree n has n roots.
# The degree of the denominator is 3.
num_poles = sympy.degree(denominator, gen=z)

# We confirm that the roots are distinct and not cancelled.
# Derivative of denominator is 3*z**2, root is z=0.
# At z=0, denominator is 2 (not 0), so no repeated roots.
# Numerator is z, root is z=0, so no poles are cancelled.

# Step 3: State the formula for the Morse index.
# Index(M) = 2 * N_p, where N_p is the number of poles.
