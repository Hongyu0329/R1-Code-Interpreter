    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. The mention of the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides context for the origin of the matrix but does not alter the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly defined.\n\nI will calculate the determinant using the cofactor expansion formula for a 3x3 matrix:\nFor a matrix\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nthe determinant is `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\nMy script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Define the elements of the given matrix `A`.\n2.  Calculate the determinant by applying the formula.\n3.  To satisfy the requirement of showing \"each number in the final equation\", I will print the formula with the specific numbers from matrix `A` substituted in.\n4.  I will then show the step-by-step simplification of this equation.\n5.  Finally, I will print the resulting determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix and shows the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The matrix is given by:\n    # A = [[ 2, -1, -1],\n    #      [-1,  2, -1],\n    #      [-1, -1,  2]]\n    # Let's assign the elements to variables a, b, c, ...\n    a, b, c = 2, -1, -1\n    d, e, f = -1, 2, -1\n    g, h, i = -1, -1, 2\n\n    # The determinant is calculated using the formula:\n    # det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    \n    # Calculate each of the smaller 2x2 determinants (the cofactors' parts)\n    term1_sub = e * i - f * h\n    term2_sub = d * i - f * g\n    term3_sub = d * h - e * g\n\n    # Multiply by the top row elements\n    part1 = a * term1_sub\n    part2 = -b * term2_sub\n    part3 = c * term3_sub\n\n    # The final determinant\n    determinant = a * term1_sub - b * term2_sub + c * term3_sub\n\n    print(\"The given matrix is:\")\n    print(np.array([[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]))\n    print(\"\\nThe determinant is calculated using the cofactor expansion formula:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values from the matrix into the formula:\")\n    # Using f-strings to construct the equation with the matrix values\n    # Note the careful handling of signs and parentheses for clarity.\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a}*({e}*{i} - ({f})*({h})) - ({b})*({d}*{i} - ({f})*({g})) + ({c})*({d}*({h}) - {e}*({g}))\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSimplifying the terms inside the parentheses:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a}*({term1_sub}) - ({b})*({term2_sub}) + ({c})*({term3_sub})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nPerforming the multiplications:\")\n    # This shows the values of each part of the expansion.\n    print(f\"det(A) = {part1} - ({b * term2_sub}) + ({part3})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinally, summing the terms:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {determinant}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<0>>>"
