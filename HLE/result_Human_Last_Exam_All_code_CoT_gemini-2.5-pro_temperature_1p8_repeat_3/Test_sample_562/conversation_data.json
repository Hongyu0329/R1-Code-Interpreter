    "My plan to solve this request is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Character:** I will first look at the Japanese character provided, which is 謄.\n2.  **Identify the Radical:** I will break down the character into its constituent parts to identify the radical (bushu). The character 謄 is composed of a left part and a right part. The left part, 言, is the radical.\n3.  **Find the Radical's Name:** When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it has a specific name. This form is called a \"hen\" (偏), and the name for 言 in this position is \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn:** I will convert the Japanese name \"gonben\" into its standard Hepburn romanization.\n5.  **Generate Code:** Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The task is to find the name of the bushu (radical) for the Japanese character '謄'.\n# The character is '謄'.\n# This character is composed of a left part and a right part.\n# The radical is the left part: 言\n# The name for the 言 radical when it's on the left side of a character is ごんべん (gonben).\n# The Hepburn romanization for ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n# This script will print the final answer.\n\nanswer = \"Gonben\"\nprint(answer)\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
