    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Rules**: The chessboard is a 5x5 grid that wraps around both horizontally and vertically (a torus). The non-attacking rule for queens on a toroidal board means that no two queens can share the same row, column, main diagonal (`row - col`), or anti-diagonal (`row + col`). The diagonal indices are calculated modulo 5 to handle the wrap-around effect.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Strategy**: The problem is to count the number of valid sets of 4 squares to place queens. Since the board size (25 squares) and the number of queens (4) are small, we can use a direct computational approach. The plan is to generate every possible combination of 4 squares on the board and then, for each combination, check if it represents a valid placement of non-attacking queens.\n\n3.  **Implement the Combination Generation**: Python's `itertools.combinations` is the perfect tool for this. It can efficiently generate all unique combinations of 4 squares chosen from the 25 total squares on the board.\n\n4.  **Implement the Validity Check**: For each combination of 4 squares, we must verify that it is a valid placement. A placement is valid if and only if all four of these conditions are met:\n    *   All 4 row indices are unique.\n    *   All 4 column indices are unique.\n    *   All 4 main diagonal indices (`(row - col) % 5`) are unique.\n    *   All 4 anti-diagonal indices (`(row + col) % 5`) are unique.\n    The most efficient way to check for uniqueness is to extract these four sets of values from the placement and check if the size of each set is equal to 4.\n\n5.  **Count and Output**: We will maintain a counter, which will be incremented for every valid combination found. Finally, the script will print the total count in a clear, descriptive sentence as requested.\n\nThis method is straightforward, self-contained, and computes the answer from the ground up without relying on external or pre-computed knowledge.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_4_queens_on_5x5_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n    A placement is valid if no two queens share the same row, column, or any wrapped diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the parameters of the problem\n    board_size = 5\n    num_queens = 4\n\n    # Initialize a counter for valid placements\n    valid_placements_count = 0\n\n    # Create a list of all squares on the board, represented by numbers from 0 to 24.\n    # This is efficient for the combination function.\n    all_squares = range(board_size * board_size)\n\n    # Generate all possible combinations of placing `num_queens` on the `all_squares`.\n    # This gives us every possible set of 4 squares.\n    for placement_indices in itertools.combinations(all_squares, num_queens):\n        \n        # For each combination, we check if it's a valid placement.\n        # First, convert the square indices back to (row, column) coordinates.\n        placement_coords = [(i // board_size, i % board_size) for i in placement_indices]\n\n        # Extract the properties of each queen's position\n        rows = [coord[0] for coord in placement_coords]\n        cols = [coord[1] for coord in placement_coords]\n        # For a toroidal board, diagonals are calculated with modulo arithmetic\n        diag1 = [(coord[0] - coord[1]) % board_size for coord in placement_coords]\n        diag2 = [(coord[0] + coord[1]) % board_size for coord in placement_coords]\n\n        # A placement is valid if all queens are on distinct rows, columns, and diagonals.\n        # We can check this by seeing if the number of unique values for each property\n        # is equal to the number of queens.\n        if (len(set(rows)) == num_queens and\n            len(set(cols)) == num_queens and\n            len(set(diag1)) == num_queens and\n            len(set(diag2)) == num_queens):\n            valid_placements_count += 1\n            \n    # The problem statement requires printing the numbers involved.\n    print(f\"Board size N = {board_size}\")\n    print(f\"Number of queens K = {num_queens}\")\n    print(f\"Result: There are {valid_placements_count} ways to place {num_queens} non-attacking queens on a {board_size}x{board_size} toroidal chessboard.\")\n\n# Execute the solver function\nsolve_4_queens_on_5x5_toroidal()\n```\n<<<500>>>"
