    "Of course. The problem is to find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This is a classic problem in Lie algebra, and the solution can be found using Witt's formula.\n\n### My plan is as follows:\n1.  **Witt's Formula:** The number of linearly independent terms of order `n` in the BCH formula for two generators (X and Y), which corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients, is given by Witt's formula for the dimension of the `n`-th subspace of a free Lie algebra on `k` generators:\n    `l_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ [d|n] (μ(d) * k^(n/d))`\n    -   Here, the order is `n = 10`.\n    -   We have two generators, X and Y, so `k = 2`.\n    -   The sum is over all positive integers `d` that divide `n`.\n    -   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Möbius Function (μ):** This number-theoretic function is defined as:\n    -   `μ(d) = 1` if `d` is square-free with an even number of prime factors.\n    -   `μ(d) = -1` if `d` is square-free with an odd number of prime factors.\n    -   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n\n3.  **Calculation for n=10:**\n    -   First, find all divisors of 10: `1, 2, 5, 10`.\n    -   Next, calculate each term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)` for each divisor `d`.\n    -   Sum these terms and divide by `n=10`.\n\n4.  **Python Script:** I will write a Python script to perform these steps. The script will contain helper functions to find divisors and compute the Möbius function. The final output will display the full calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all positive divisors of an integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    It checks for squared prime factors and counts the number of\n    distinct prime factors.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    prime_factors = 0\n    i = 2\n    num = n\n    while i * i <= num:\n        if num % i == 0:\n            prime_factors += 1\n            num //= i\n            # Check for squared factor\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return 0\n        i += 1\n    \n    if num > 1: # The remaining number is a prime factor\n        prime_factors += 1\n        \n    return -1 if prime_factors % 2 != 0 else 1\n\ndef solve_bch_coefficient_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients for a given order 'n'\n    in the BCH expansion using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # The order of the coefficients\n    k = 2   # The number of generators (X, Y)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_terms_values = []\n    \n    # Calculate each term in the summation part of Witt's formula\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        sum_terms_values.append(term)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Format the final equation for printing\n    # Example: (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2) / 10 = 99\n    equation_sum_part = \" + \".join(map(str, sum_terms_values)).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    final_equation = f\"({equation_sum_part}) / {n} = {result}\"\n    \n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is calculated using Witt's formula.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_coefficient_count()\n\n```\n<<<99>>>"
