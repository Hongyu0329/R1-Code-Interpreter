# The problem is a theoretical one about simply typed lambda calculus and parametricity.
# The number of extensionally distinct functions is determined by a logical argument,
# not a direct computation on a specific input. The steps of the argument are:
# 1. A "shallow" expression e can only apply p to arguments that do not depend on p.
#    These arguments can be built from x.
# 2. There are four such basic arguments, which we called A_T, A_F, A_x, A_not_x.
#    So e is a boolean function G of p(A_T), p(A_F), p(A_x), p(A_not_x).
# 3. The overall function F = \p.\x.e is polymorphic in X.
# 4. By parametricity ("Theorems for Free"), for any given p, the function \x.e(p,x)
#    must be constant with respect to x.
# 5. This implies that the boolean function G cannot depend on the arguments that
#    are functions of x (p(A_x) and p(A_not_x)).
# 6. Therefore, e must be a boolean function H of only p(A_T) and p(A_F).
# 7. The number of boolean functions of 2 variables is 2^(2^2).
# 8. All these functions are extensionally distinct because we can choose values of p
#    to produce all 4 possible input pairs for H.

num_inputs = 2  # The two constant arguments, p(λk.True) and p(λk.False)

# The number of boolean functions with n inputs is 2^(2^n).
num_functions = 2**(2**num_inputs)

print(f"The number of inputs to the final boolean function H is {num_inputs}.")
print(f"The number of distinct boolean functions is 2**(2**{num_inputs}).")
print(f"Final calculation: 2**(2**{num_inputs}) = 2**{2**num_inputs} = {num_functions}")
print(f"So, there are {num_functions} extensionally distinct functions induced by shallow e's.")
