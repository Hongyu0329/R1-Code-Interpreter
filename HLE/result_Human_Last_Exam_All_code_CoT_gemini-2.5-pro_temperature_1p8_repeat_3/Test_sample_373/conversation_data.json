    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the specified barbell graph and the mechanics of randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees:** We need to calculate the degree of each node (the number of edges connected to it).\n    *   In a complete graph of 5 nodes (K5), each node is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n    *   There are two special nodes, one in each clique, that are connected by the bottleneck edge. Let's call them `u_A` and `u_B`.\n    *   The degree of `u_A` is its 4 connections within its own clique plus its 1 connection to `u_B`, making its total degree 5.\n    *   The degree of `u_B` is similarly 5.\n    *   All other 8 nodes (4 in each clique) are only connected within their respective cliques, so their degree is 4.\n3.  **Understand Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** The process involves two steps:\n    *   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from all 10 nodes. The probability of picking any specific node is `1 / 10`.\n    *   Second, the selected node chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with. The probability of it choosing a specific neighbor `v` is `1 / degree(u)`, where `u` is the selected node.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u_A, u_B)` is sampled if either of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n    *   **Event 1:** Node `u_A` is selected, and it then selects node `u_B`.\n    *   **Event 2:** Node `u_B` is selected, and it then selects node `u_A`.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n5.  **Code the Calculation:** We will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\ntotal_nodes = 10\n\n# The barbell graph consists of two cliques.\n# Size of each clique (m) is total_nodes / 2.\nclique_size = total_nodes / 2\n\n# In a barbell graph, the two cliques are connected by a single \"bottleneck\" edge.\n# Let the nodes at the ends of this bottleneck edge be u_A and u_B.\n\n# The degree of a node at the end of the bottleneck edge is calculated as:\n# (connections inside its clique) + (the bottleneck connection)\n# Inside a clique of size m, a node is connected to m-1 other nodes.\n# So, degree = (m - 1) + 1 = m.\ndegree_bottleneck_node = int(clique_size)\n\n# The gossiping process involves:\n# 1. Picking a node `u` uniformly at random from all N nodes. P(pick u) = 1/N.\n# 2. The chosen node `u` picks a neighbor `v` uniformly at random. P(u picks v) = 1/degree(u).\n\n# We want to find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u_A, u_B).\n# This can happen in two ways:\n# 1. Node u_A is picked, and it picks its neighbor u_B.\nprob_a_picks_b = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node)\n\n# 2. Node u_B is picked, and it picks its neighbor u_A.\nprob_b_picks_a = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node)\n\n# The total probability is the sum of these two mutually exclusive events.\ntotal_probability = prob_a_picks_b + prob_b_picks_a\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(\"A barbell graph with 10 nodes has two cliques of 5 nodes each.\")\nprint(f\"The two nodes at the ends of the connecting bottleneck edge each have a degree of {degree_bottleneck_node}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of two scenarios:\")\nprint(\"1. Picking the first bottleneck node AND that node picking the second.\")\nprint(\"2. Picking the second bottleneck node AND that node picking the first.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"P(bottleneck) = P(pick u_A) * P(u_A picks u_B) + P(pick u_B) * P(u_B picks u_A)\")\nprint(f\"P(bottleneck) = (1 / {total_nodes}) * (1 / {degree_bottleneck_node}) + (1 / {total_nodes}) * (1 / {degree_bottleneck_node})\")\nprint(f\"P(bottleneck) = {prob_a_picks_b} + {prob_b_picks_a}\")\nprint(f\"P(bottleneck) = {total_probability}\")\nprint(f\"As a fraction, this is 2/50 or 1/25.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
