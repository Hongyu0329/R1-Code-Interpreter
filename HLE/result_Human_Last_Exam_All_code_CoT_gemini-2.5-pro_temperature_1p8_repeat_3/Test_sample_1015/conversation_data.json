    "This is a knowledge-based question about ballet technique. My plan is to use a Python script to first present the question and the available choices. Then, the script will provide a detailed explanation of the technical differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods concerning the *cambré derrière*, focusing on why one choice is more accurate than the others. Finally, the script will print the correct answer.\n\nThe core of the reasoning is that the Vaganova method emphasizes maintaining a square and stable pelvis, with the bend originating purely from the spine. In contrast, the Balanchine style often allows the hip of the working leg to lift, which facilitates a deeper and more stylized backbend. This makes the hip placement the most fundamental difference.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and answers a multiple-choice question about ballet technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': \"Arm placement during allongé\",\n        'B': \"Placement of hip\",\n        'C': \"Speed\",\n        'D': \"Degree of backbend\",\n        'E': \"Placement of head\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"Analyzing the options...\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Reasoning ---\")\n    print(\"1. Vaganova Method: This method places a strong emphasis on core strength and precise alignment. In a cambré derrière (backward bend), the rule is to keep the hips absolutely square and level over the supporting legs. The bend should originate from the upper and middle back, maintaining the stability of the pelvis.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n2. Balanchine Method: Developed for a neoclassical aesthetic, this method often exaggerates classical lines for dynamism and effect. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer is frequently taught to release or lift the hip of the working leg. This allows for a much deeper, more dramatic backbend than is possible while keeping the hips perfectly square.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n3. Conclusion: While the degree of the backbend (D) and the placement of the head (E) may also appear different, these are often results of the foundational technical difference. The primary distinction that enables the unique aesthetic of the Balanchine cambré is the deliberate use of the hip (B), which contrasts sharply with the strict Vaganova principle of a stable, square pelvis.\")\n    \n    correct_answer_key = 'B'\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    print(f\"The most significant and fundamental difference is B: {options[correct_answer_key]}.\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
