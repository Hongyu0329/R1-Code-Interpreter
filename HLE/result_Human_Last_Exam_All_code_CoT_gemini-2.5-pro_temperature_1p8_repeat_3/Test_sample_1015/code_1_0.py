    print("1. Vaganova Method: This method places a strong emphasis on core strength and precise alignment. In a cambré derrière (backward bend), the rule is to keep the hips absolutely square and level over the supporting legs. The bend should originate from the upper and middle back, maintaining the stability of the pelvis.")
    
    print("\n2. Balanchine Method: Developed for a neoclassical aesthetic, this method often exaggerates classical lines for dynamism and effect. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer is frequently taught to release or lift the hip of the working leg. This allows for a much deeper, more dramatic backbend than is possible while keeping the hips perfectly square.")

    print("\n3. Conclusion: While the degree of the backbend (D) and the placement of the head (E) may also appear different, these are often results of the foundational technical difference. The primary distinction that enables the unique aesthetic of the Balanchine cambré is the deliberate use of the hip (B), which contrasts sharply with the strict Vaganova principle of a stable, square pelvis.")
