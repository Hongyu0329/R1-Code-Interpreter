    "To find the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the outer-hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its outer-hull (or convex hull) is the smallest convex shape that encloses it. The vertices of the great icosahedron coincide with the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, its outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the triangulation:** The question asks for the number of triangles needed to triangulate this outer-hull. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron whose faces are already 20 equilateral triangles.\n3.  **Determine the count:** Since the faces of the outer-hull are already the triangles we need, no further triangulation is required. The problem is thus reduced to finding the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n4.  **Calculate the number of faces:** We can use Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. For a regular icosahedron:\n    *   Vertices (V) = 12\n    *   Edges (E) = 30\n    *   We can solve for faces (F): `F = 2 - V + E`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_great_icosahedron_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of triangles on the outer-hull of a great icosahedron.\n\n    The outer-hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    The number of triangles needed to triangulate this hull is simply its number of faces.\n    We use Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) to find the number of faces (F).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Properties of a regular icosahedron (the outer-hull)\n    V = 12  # Number of vertices\n    E = 30  # Number of edges\n    Euler_char = 2 # Euler characteristic for convex polyhedra\n\n    # Using Euler's formula to find the number of faces (F): F = 2 - V + E\n    F = Euler_char - V + E\n\n    print(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"The number of visible triangles is equal to the number of faces (F) of this icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"We can find F using Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2, or F = 2 - V + E.\")\n    print(f\"Given Vertices (V) = {V} and Edges (E) = {E}:\")\n    # As requested, outputting each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"The calculation is: F = {Euler_char} - {V} + {E}\")\n    print(f\"So, the number of triangles is {F}.\")\n\nsolve_great_icosahedron_triangulation()\n<<<20>>>\n```"
