    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to find the number of independent continuous transformations of time, space, velocity, and pressure variables that leave the form of the equations unchanged.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nWhile the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional (due to an arbitrary function of time that can be added to the pressure, and transformations to accelerating frames), the question typically refers to the maximal *finite-dimensional* Lie group of symmetries. This group is known as the Galilean-similitude group.\n\nMy plan is to identify the elementary transformations that constitute this group and sum their dimensions (i.e., the number of parameters they depend on).\n\nThe transformations and their corresponding dimensions are:\n1.  **Time translation:** Shifting time by a constant ($t \\rightarrow t + a$). This is a 1-parameter family of transformations.\n2.  **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates by a constant vector ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$). Since the vector is in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this provides 3 parameters.\n3.  **Space rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, with velocity transforming as a vector, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{u}$). The group of rotations in 3D space, $SO(3)$, is 3-dimensional.\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** Transforming to a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$). The boost velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ provides 3 parameters.\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations are also invariant under a scaling transformation of all variables. This is a 1-parameter transformation.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions from each of these independent symmetry transformations. The following Python code will calculate this sum.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the dimension of the finite-dimensional Lie group of\n# symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in 3D.\n\n# Dimension from time translation (t -> t + a)\ndim_time_translation = 1\n\n# Dimension from space translations (x -> x + b) in R^3\ndim_space_translation = 3\n\n# Dimension from space rotations (group SO(3))\ndim_rotations = 3\n\n# Dimension from Galilean boosts (u -> u + v) in R^3\ndim_galilean_boosts = 3\n\n# Dimension from scaling transformations (a single parameter group)\ndim_scaling = 1\n\n# The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these independent\n# symmetry transformations.\ntotal_dimension = (dim_time_translation +\n                   dim_space_translation +\n                   dim_rotations +\n                   dim_galilean_boosts +\n                   dim_scaling)\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final sum in an equation format.\nprint(\"The total dimension is the sum of dimensions from each symmetry transformation:\")\nprint(f\"Time Translation (1) + Space Translations (3) + Rotations (3) + Galilean Boosts (3) + Scaling (1)\")\nprint(f\"Equation: {dim_time_translation} + {dim_space_translation} + {dim_rotations} + {dim_galilean_boosts} + {dim_scaling} = {total_dimension}\")\n\n```\n<<<11>>>"
