    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nThis is a factual question. The best way to answer it with code is to store the names of the Nobel laureates in a data structure and then print them in a formatted string.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a list containing the names of the two Nobel laureates.\n2.  Use an f-string to print a sentence that directly answers the question, incorporating the names from the list.\n\n```python\n# The two Nobel laureates who appeared in a 2000 Enron commercial\n# with the tagline \"Ask Why\" are stored in this list.\nlaureates = [\"Paul Krugman\", \"Myron Scholes\"]\n\n# Print the names in a sentence that answers the question.\nprint(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron 'Ask Why' commercial were {laureates[0]} and {laureates[1]}.\")\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
