To apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to the boundary value problem
u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, with u(0) = u(1) = 0,
we must define a complete metric space M on which a corresponding integral operator T is a contraction that maps M to itself.

1.  Deriving a property of the solution:
    The equation can be written as u''(x) = exp(u(x)). Since exp(z) > 0 for any real z, we have u''(x) > 0. This means any solution u(x) must be a convex function. A convex function satisfying the boundary conditions u(0) = 0 and u(1) = 0 must be non-positive throughout the interval [0, 1].

2.  Defining the set M:
    Based on this property, the appropriate set M is the space of all non-positive continuous functions on the interval [0, 1].

    M = { u in C([0, 1]) | u(x) <= 0 for all x in [0, 1] }

    This set is a closed subset of the Banach space C([0, 1]) and is therefore a complete metric space itself.

3.  Verifying the contraction mapping property:
    The operator T is given by (Tu)(x) = - integral from 0 to 1 of G(x, s)exp(u(s))ds.

    -   T maps M to M: If u is in M, u(x) <= 0, so exp(u(s)) > 0. The Green's function G(x,s) is also non-negative. The integral is thus positive, and (Tu)(x), being its negative, is non-positive. So Tu is in M.

    -   T is a contraction on M: For any u, v in M, we have ||Tu - Tv|| <= k * ||u - v||.
        The contraction constant k is determined by the "final equation":
        k <= sup(exp(c)) * max_integral(G(x,s))
        - For u,v in M, exp(c) <= exp(0) = 1.
        - The maximum value of the integral of the Green's function is 1/8.
        The equation for the contraction constant k is therefore:
        k <= 1 * (1/8)
        k <= 1/8

    Since k = 1/8 < 1, the operator T is a contraction on M. Thus, M is the correct set to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution via the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.
