def solve_f2l_pairs():
    """
    This function calculates and prints the minimum move sequence to solve two F2L pairs
    from the given cube state.
    
    The state is determined by the scramble and re-orientation. The analysis shows:
    - The White-Red-Blue (WRB) pair is incorrectly solved in the Front-Left (FL) slot.
    - The White-Orange-Blue (WOB) pair needs to be solved into the now-occupied FL slot.

    The strategy is:
    1. Take out the wrongly solved WRB pair from the FL slot.
    2. Insert the WRB pair into its correct Back-Left (BL) slot.
    3. Solve the WOB pair into the now-empty FL slot.
