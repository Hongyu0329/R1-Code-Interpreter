    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in `ϕ^4` theory near four dimensions, we will use the renormalization group (RG) framework in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **State the Beta Function:** The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, `β(u)`, which dictates how the dimensionless coupling `u` evolves with the energy scale. For a `ϕ^4` theory with a single scalar field, the one-loop beta function is:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + B * u²`\n    The term `-ϵu` arises from the engineering dimension of the coupling constant in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions. The `B * u²` term is the one-loop quantum correction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coefficient B:** For the standard interaction Lagrangian `(λ/4!)ϕ⁴`, the corresponding dimensionless coupling `u` has a coefficient `B = 3 / (16π²)`. This value is a classic result from calculating the one-loop correction to the four-point vertex function.\n\n3.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point `u*` represents a scale-invariant point of the theory. At this point, the coupling ceases to \"run\" with the energy scale, so the beta function must be zero:\n    `β(u*) = 0`\n\n4.  **Solve for u*:** We will solve the equation `-ϵu* + B * (u*)² = 0`. This equation has a trivial solution `u* = 0` (the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial solution (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point), which is the one we are interested in.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan using the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculation and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher\n    fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Introduction and Setup ---\n    print(\"This script finds the fixed point coupling u^* for the phi^4 theory in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions.\")\n    print(\"The calculation uses the one-loop renormalization group (RG) beta function.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe beta function, beta(u), describes the running of the dimensionless coupling 'u' with energy scale.\")\n    print(\"To leading order in epsilon and u, it is given by:\")\n    print(\"beta(u) = -epsilon * u + B * u^2\")\n\n    # Define the coefficient B for single-component phi^4 theory\n    # This corresponds to the interaction Lagrangian L_int = (lambda/4!) * phi^4\n    # The value of B is a standard result from one-loop calculations.\n    B_num = 3\n    B_den_coeff = 16\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFor the standard single-component phi^4 theory, the constant B = {B_num} / ({B_den_coeff} * pi^2).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nA fixed point u^* is a value of the coupling where the theory is scale-invariant,\")\n    print(\"which means the beta function is zero: beta(u^*) = 0.\")\n    print(\"\\nSolving the equation: -epsilon * u^* + B * (u^*)^2 = 0\")\n    print(\"We are looking for the non-trivial solution where u^* is not zero.\")\n\n    # --- Symbolic Calculation ---\n    \n    # Define the symbols needed for the equation\n    u_star = sympy.Symbol('u^*')\n    epsilon = sympy.Symbol('epsilon')\n    pi = sympy.pi\n\n    # Define the constant B\n    B = B_num / (B_den_coeff * pi**2)\n\n    # Define the beta function equation\n    beta_function_eq = sympy.Eq(-epsilon * u_star + B * u_star**2, 0)\n    \n    # Solve the equation for u*\n    solutions = sympy.solve(beta_function_eq, u_star)\n\n    # The solutions are [0, epsilon/B].
