    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** First, I'll parse the chemical names to determine the structures of the two reactants: the aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and the phosphorus ylide ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane).\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The Wittig reaction forms a carbon-carbon double bond by replacing the C=O of a carbonyl compound and the C=P of a phosphorus ylide. I will identify which parts of the reactant molecules combine.\n3.  **Determine Product Structure:** I'll combine the fragments from the aldehyde and the ylide to form the new alkene product. I will also identify the by-product, which is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n4.  **Predict Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of the resulting alkene (E or Z) depends on the nature of the ylide. I'll classify the ylide as stabilized or non-stabilized to predict the major stereoisomer formed. Non-stabilized ylides typically yield Z-alkenes with aldehydes.\n5.  **Name the Product:** I will provide the systematic IUPAC name for the major organic product, including the stereochemical descriptor (E/Z).\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I'll write a Python script to print out the full reaction equation and state the name of the resulting major product.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the reaction and its product:\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the product of a specified Wittig reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the reactants based on their names.\n    # Aldehyde: pivalaldehyde is (CH3)3C-CHO\n    # Ylide: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane is Ph3P=CH-CH2-(2-Cl-Ph)\n    # The ylide is non-stabilized, which favors the Z-alkene product.\n    aldehyde_formula = \"(CH3)3C-CHO\"\n    aldehyde_name = \"pivalaldehyde\"\n    \n    ylide_formula = \"Ph3P=CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl)\"\n    ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenylphosphorane\"\n\n    # 2. Define the products of the reaction.\n    # The reaction combines the (CH3)3C-CH group from the aldehyde and the CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl) group from the ylide.\n    # Since the ylide is non-stabilized, the Z (cis) isomer is the major product.\n    alkene_product_formula = \"(Z)-(CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl)\"\n    alkene_product_name = \"(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n    \n    byproduct_formula = \"Ph3P=O\"\n    byproduct_name = \"triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n\n    # 3.
