    "Answering this question from algebraic topology requires applying several theorems about the homotopy groups of topological spaces, particularly loop spaces, suspensions, and smash products. The calculation proceeds by determining the connectivity of the fiber of the map in question.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Map:** The map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is best understood as the adjoint of a related map. Let $X = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ and $Y = S^4 \\wedge S^6$. The map is $f: \\Sigma X \\to \\Omega Y$. This map is naturally constructed as the adjoint of the map $g: \\Sigma^2 X \\to Y$, which is itself the smash product of the evaluation maps $ev_{S^4}: \\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\to S^4$ and $ev_{S^6}: \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^6$.\n\n2.  **Relate Connectivities:** The connectivity of a map $h: A \\to B$ is one greater than the connectivity of its homotopy fiber, $F_h$. Furthermore, the connectivity of a map and its adjoint are related. If $g: \\Sigma A \\to B$ is a map, its adjoint is $adj(g): A \\to \\Omega B$. Their connectivities are related by $\\text{conn}(adj(g)) = \\text{conn}(g) - 1$. Our map $f$ is the adjoint of $g$, so we first need to find the connectivity of $g$.\n\n3.  **Fiber of a Smash Product of Maps:** The map $g$ is a smash product of two maps, $g = ev_{S^4} \\wedge ev_{S^6}$. The homotopy fiber of such a smash product map $h_1 \\wedge h_2$ can be constructed as a pushout involving the fibers of $h_1$ and $h_2$.\n\n4.  **Connectivity of Components:** We will calculate the connectivity of all the spaces involved in the pushout construction of the fiber of $g$. This relies on standard formulas:\n    *   The connectivity of the n-sphere $S^n$ is $n-1$.\n    *   The connectivity of a loop space $\\Omega Z$ is one less than the connectivity of $Z$.\n    *   The connectivity of a suspension $\\Sigma Z$ is one more than the connectivity of $Z$.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $\\text{conn}(A) + \\text{conn}(B) + 1$.\n    *   The fiber of the evaluation map $ev_{S^n}: \\Sigma \\Omega S^n \\to S^n$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\Sigma (\\Omega S^n \\wedge \\Omega S^n)$, and its connectivity is $2n-2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate Final Connectivity:** Using the connectivity of the components, we find the connectivity of the fiber of $g$ using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homotopy groups. From this, we find the connectivity of $g$, and finally, the connectivity of the original map $f$.\n\nThe following Python script automates the calculations described in the plan.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the connectivity of a map in algebraic topology.\")\n    print(\"The final result is obtained by following a series of steps based on standard homotopy theory results.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Define sphere dimensions\n    n4 = 4\n    n6 = 6\n    print(f\"We are working with spheres S^{n4} and S^{n6}.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Calculate the connectivity of the building block spaces.\")\n    # Connectivity of Omega S^n is n-2\n    conn_omega_s4 = n4 - 2\n    conn_omega_s6 = n6 - 2\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^{n4} is {n4} - 2 = {conn_omega_s4}\")\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^{n6} is {n6} - 2 = {conn_omega_s6}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the connectivity of the fibers of the evaluation maps.\")\n    # The fiber of ev: Sigma Omega S^n -> S^n is Sigma(Omega S^n wedge Omega S^n)\n    # Its connectivity is 2n - 2.\n    conn_fiber_ev_s4 = 2 * n4 - 2\n    conn_fiber_ev_s6 = 2 * n6 - 2\n    print(f\"The fiber of the evaluation map for S^{n4} has connectivity {2*n4} - 2 = {conn_fiber_ev_s4}\")\n    print(f\"The fiber of the evaluation map for S^{n6} has connectivity {2*n6} - 2 = {conn_fiber_ev_s6}\")\n    \n    # These fibers are denoted F_1 and F_2 respectively.\n    F1_conn = conn_fiber_ev_s4\n    F2_conn = conn_fiber_ev_s6\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Determine the connectivity of the spaces in the smash product of maps.\")\n    # The map in question is the adjoint of g = ev_S4 wedge ev_S6.\n    # ev_S4 maps from A1 = Sigma Omega S^4\n    # ev_S6 maps from A2 = Sigma Omega S^6\n    conn_A1 = conn_omega_s4 + 1\n    conn_A2 = conn_omega_s6 + 1\n    print(f\"The domain of ev_S4 is Sigma Omega S^4, which has connectivity {conn_omega_s4} + 1 = {conn_A1}\")\n    print(f\"The domain of ev_S6 is Sigma Omega S^6, which has connectivity {conn_omega_s6} + 1 = {conn_A2}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: The fiber of g = ev_S4 wedge ev_S6 is a pushout.
