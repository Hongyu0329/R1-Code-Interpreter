    "My plan is to answer the user's trivia question about the \"Homestar Runner\" cartoon. Since the user has requested the answer be delivered via a script, I will write a simple Python program. This program will store the name of the fictional singer in a variable and then use a print statement to output the answer in a complete sentence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the Homestar Runner trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the fictional singer from the episode.\n    singer_name = \"Thompkins\"\n    \n    # The episode number in question.\n    episode_number = 15\n    \n    # Print the answer in a descriptive sentence.\n    print(\n        f\"In the online cartoon series 'Homestar Runner', episode 'Teen Girl Squad #{episode_number}', \"\n        f\"a cardboard cutout of the fictional singer {singer_name} performs at the Junior prom.\"\n    )\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
