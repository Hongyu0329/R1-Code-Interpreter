    This function determines the necessary assumption for the expected information gain of a Bayesian agent to approach zero and prints the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The expected information gain at time t is the expected KL divergence between the posterior at t+1 and t.
    2. The sum of all expected information gains over time is bounded by the entropy of the agent's prior distribution, H(M).
    3. The expected information gain at any step is non-negative.
    4. For an infinite sum of non-negative terms to be finite, the terms must approach zero.
    5. Therefore, a sufficient condition for the information gain to approach zero is that the total sum is finite, which is true if the prior entropy H(M) is finite. This makes assumption (a) critical.
    6. Other assumptions are either too specific to certain problem domains (b, c), stronger than necessary (e), or not required for the core information-theoretic argument (d).

    The correct choice is (a).
    In Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), where each clause is alphabetically ordered and surrounded by parentheses, and the whole conjunction is in brackets, the answer 'a' is represented as "[(a)]".
