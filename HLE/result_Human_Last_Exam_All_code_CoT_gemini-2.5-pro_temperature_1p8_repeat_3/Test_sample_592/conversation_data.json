    "Here is a plan to answer your question:\n1.  I will first identify the key information from your query: the movie title \"Ovosodo\", the year \"1997\", the character \"Tommaso\", and the destination country \"United States\".\n2.  I will then find the specific US city that the character moves to in the movie's plot.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a sentence that answers your question, including the year of the movie as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_city():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's question about the movie Ovosodo.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"Ovosodo\"\n    movie_year = 1997\n    character_name = \"Tommaso\"\n    destination_city = \"New York City\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence.\n    # The year 1997 is included as requested.\n    print(f\"In the {movie_year} movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} moves to {destination_city}.\")\n\nfind_city()\n```\n<<<New York City>>>"
