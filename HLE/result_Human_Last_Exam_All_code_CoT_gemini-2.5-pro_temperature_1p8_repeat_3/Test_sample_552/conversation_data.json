    "To answer your question, I will first identify the specific 1905 paper by Albert Einstein on Brownian motion. Then, I will consult historical and academic sources to determine which scientist's lectures or works were cited or served as a direct foundation for his reasoning in that paper.\n\nThe core of Einstein's paper relied on the principles of statistical mechanics. The most prominent figure in this field, whose work heavily influenced Einstein, was Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein's paper builds directly upon the statistical framework established by Boltzmann.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the name of the scientist whose work and lectures\n  were foundational to Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n  \"\"\"\n  scientist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n  paper_topic = \"1905 paper on Brownian motion\"\n  \n  print(f\"In his {paper_topic}, Albert Einstein's work was heavily based on the theoretical foundations, including lectures and writings, laid by {scientist}.\")\n\nfind_cited_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
