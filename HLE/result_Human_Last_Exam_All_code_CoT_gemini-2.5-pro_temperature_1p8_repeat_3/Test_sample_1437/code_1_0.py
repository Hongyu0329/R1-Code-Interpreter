# The Lindhard polarization function, Π(q,0), evaluated at q=0 gives -D(E_F),
# which is the negative of the density of states at the Fermi level. This value
# depends on the material's electron density.

# However, the dimensionless Lindhard screening function, F(q) = Π(q,0)/Π(0,0),
# approaches a universal numerical value in the limit q -> 0.
# We will calculate this value.

# The Taylor series expansion of the Lindhard screening function F(x) for small x,
# where x = q / (2*k_F), is:
# F(x) ≈ 1 - (1/3) * x^2
