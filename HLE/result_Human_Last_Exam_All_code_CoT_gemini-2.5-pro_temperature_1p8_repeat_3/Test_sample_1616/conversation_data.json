    "My plan is to analyze each word based on the rules of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Trisyllabic Laxing (or Shortening)** is a sound change rule in English where a long vowel in a root word becomes short when that vowel falls in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable of a derived word. For this rule to apply, the derived word must have at least three syllables.\n\nI will go through each word in the list and check two conditions:\n1.  Does the word have at least three syllables?\n2.  If so, does it show a vowel shortening in its antepenultimate syllable when compared to its root word?\n\nA word that does not meet these conditions has not undergone trisyllabic laxing. I will use a Python script to formalize this analysis and identify the correct word.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# In Python 3, to ensure unicode characters like 'ā' or 'ī' print correctly on all systems.\nif sys.stdout.encoding != 'UTF-8':\n    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef analyze_words():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    words_data = {\n        'southern': {'syllables': 2, 'root': 'south', 'root_vowel': 'aʊ (as in mouth)', 'word_vowel': 'ʌ (as in strut)', 'origin': 'Germanic'},\n        'derivative': {'syllables': 4, 'root': 'derive', 'root_vowel': 'aɪ (as in prize)', 'word_vowel': 'ɪ (as in kit)', 'origin': 'Latinate'},\n        'serenity': {'syllables': 4, 'root': 'serene', 'root_vowel': 'iː (as in fleet)', 'word_vowel': 'ɛ (as in dress)', 'origin': 'Latinate'},\n        'pleasant': {'syllables': 2, 'root': 'please', 'root_vowel': 'iː (as in fleet)', 'word_vowel': 'ɛ (as in dress)', 'origin': 'Latinate'},\n        'gratitude': {'syllables': 3, 'root': 'grateful/grace', 'root_vowel': 'eɪ (as in face)', 'word_vowel': 'æ (as in trap)', 'origin': 'Latinate'},\n        'shadow': {'syllables': 2, 'root': 'shade', 'root_vowel': 'eɪ (as in face)', 'word_vowel': 'æ (as in trap)', 'origin': 'Germanic'}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing each word for Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)...\")\n    print(\"Rule: TSL shortens a long vowel in the 3rd-to-last syllable of a word (word must have >= 3 syllables).\\n\")\n    \n    non_tsl_candidates = []\n\n    for word, data in words_data.items():\n        print(f\"--- Analyzing: {word.capitalize()} ---\")\n        print(f\"Syllable count: {data['syllables']}\")\n        print(f\"Comparison: Root '{data['root']}' [{data['root_vowel']}] -> '{word}' [{data['word_vowel']}]\")\n        \n        if data['syllables'] >= 3:\n            # All words with >= 3 syllables in this list are textbook examples of TSL.\n            # The laxing happens in the antepenultimate syllable.\n            # de-RIV-a-tive, se-REN-i-ty, GRAT-i-tude\n            print(\"Verdict: MEETS the syllable requirement for TSL.
