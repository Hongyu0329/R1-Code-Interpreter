    "Of course, I can help with that. Determining the ideal stoichiometry for a catalyst is a complex problem that depends on many factors, including the synthesis method and specific reaction conditions. The goal is to maximize the number of active Nickel sites while ensuring they are well-dispersed and strongly interacting with the Ceria support, which prevents particle agglomeration and deactivation.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Based on a review of scientific literature, I will identify a consensus on the optimal atomic ratio of Ni to Ce that balances these factors for reactions like WGS and water splitting.\n2.  I will write a Python script that states this optimal ratio clearly.\n3.  The script will also calculate the corresponding weight percentage (wt%), as catalyst composition is often expressed this way. This requires the atomic masses of Nickel (Ni) and Cerium (Ce).\n4.  Finally, the script will print a clear output explaining the ideal ratio and showing the numbers involved.\n\n```python\ndef find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalysts based on scientific literature.\n    The ideal ratio maximizes the dispersion of Ni active sites on the Ceria support,\n    enhancing catalytic activity for Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the atomic masses (in g/mol).\n    atomic_mass_ni = 58.69\n    atomic_mass_ce = 140.12\n\n    # Based on literature, an atomic ratio of 1 part Ni to 8 parts Ce is often found\n    # to be optimal. This provides a high density of active sites without significant\n    # Ni particle agglomeration.\n    optimal_ni_atoms = 1\n    optimal_ce_atoms = 8\n\n    # Calculate the total mass for this atomic ratio\n    total_mass_ni = optimal_ni_atoms * atomic_mass_ni\n    total_mass_ce = optimal_ce_atoms * atomic_mass_ce\n    total_catalyst_mass = total_mass_ni + total_mass_ce\n\n    # Calculate the weight percentage (wt%) of Nickel in the catalyst\n    ni_weight_percentage = (total_mass_ni / total_catalyst_mass) * 100\n\n    # Print the findings\n    print(\"Based on scientific literature, a highly effective Ni/Ce atomic ratio for catalytic performance is:\")\n    print(f\"Ni / Ce = {optimal_ni_atoms} / {optimal_ce_atoms}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis ratio represents a decimal value of {optimal_ni_atoms / optimal_ce_atoms:.3f}.\")\n    print(f\"This atomic ratio corresponds to a Nickel content of approximately {ni_weight_percentage:.2f} wt%.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis composition is considered ideal as it promotes high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles\")\n    print(\"and strong metal-support interaction, which are crucial for maximizing catalytic activity.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio()\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
