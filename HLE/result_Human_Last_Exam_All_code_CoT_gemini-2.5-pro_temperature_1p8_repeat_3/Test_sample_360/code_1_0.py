# Step 1: Analyze the chirality of the metal center core.
# The reactant complex cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2] has a chiral [Ru(bpy)2] core.
# An octahedral complex with two non-planar, symmetrical bidentate ligands like bipyridine (bpy)
# exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).
# These are denoted as Delta (Δ) for a right-handed propeller twist and Lambda (Λ) for a left-handed twist.
n_core_chiral_forms = 2
print(f"Step 1: The [Ru(bpy)2] core is chiral and exists in {n_core_chiral_forms} forms (Δ and Λ).")

# Step 2: Analyze the incoming ligand.
# The ligand L (2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole) is an unsymmetrical bidentate ligand.
# It binds to the metal through two different nitrogen atoms: one from a pyridyl ring and one from a thiazole ring.
# Let's denote this ligand as BC, where B and C are the two different donor atoms.
print("Step 2: The ligand L is unsymmetrical (type BC).")

# Step 3: Count the number of ways the unsymmetrical ligand can bind to one chiral core.
# For a given chiral core (e.g., the Δ form), the two coordination sites left by the Cl- ions are in a chiral environment.
# Placing the unsymmetrical ligand L (BC) in these sites can be done in two ways:
# 1. Donor B binds to site 1, Donor C to site 2.
# 2. Donor C binds to site 1, Donor B to site 2.
# Because the environment is chiral, these two arrangements are not identical or mirror images, but are diastereomers.
n_orientations_per_core = 2
print(f"Step 3: For each chiral core, the unsymmetrical ligand L can bind in {n_orientations_per_core} distinct orientations, creating diastereomers.")

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of isomers.
# The total number of isomers is the product of the number of chiral forms of the core
# and the number of orientations the unsymmetrical ligand can adopt for each core.
# This gives two pairs of enantiomers.
total_isomers = n_core_chiral_forms * n_orientations_per_core

print("\nFinal Calculation:")
print(f"Total isomers = (Number of core chiral forms) * (Number of ligand orientations per core)")
print(f"Total isomers = {n_core_chiral_forms} * {n_orientations_per_core} = {total_isomers}")
