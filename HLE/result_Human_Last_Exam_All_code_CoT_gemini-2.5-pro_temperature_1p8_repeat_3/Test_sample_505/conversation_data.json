    "For this problem, we need to calculate the number of logical qubits based on the topology of the surface code. Here's the plan:\n\n1.  **Recall the rule:** The number of logical qubits (*k*) that can be encoded in a single planar patch of a surface code is equal to the number of holes (*h*) it contains. The formula is *k = h*.\n2.  **Consider multiple patches:** The user specifies two separate patches. For a system with multiple, disconnected patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits on each individual patch.\n3.  **Apply the rule:** Let the number of holes in the first patch be *h1* and in the second patch be *h2*. The total number of logical qubits (*K_total*) will be *k1 + k2*. According to the rule, this is equal to *h1 + h2*.\n4.  **Calculate the total:** The problem states there are two holes in total, so *h1 + h2 = 2*. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is also 2, regardless of how the holes are distributed between the two patches (e.g., one hole in each, or two holes in one and zero in the other). The maximum number of logical qubits is therefore 2.\n\nThe Python code below will state this principle and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the given parameters from the problem description\nnum_patches = 2\ntotal_holes = 2\n\n# The number of logical qubits, k, that can be encoded in a single\n# planar patch of a surface code is equal to the number of holes, h,\n# that the patch contains.\n# Formula for a single patch: k = h\n\n# For a system with multiple, separate patches, the total number of\n# logical qubits (K_total) is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n# Let's say we have patch 1 and patch 2.\n# K_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2\n#\n# Using the principle from above, we can substitute k with h for each patch:\n# K_total = h_patch1 + h_patch2\n#\n# The sum of holes in each patch is, by definition, the total number of holes\n# in the system.\n# Therefore, K_total = total_holes.\n\ntotal_logical_qubits = total_holes\n\n# Print the reasoning and the final equation.\nprint(f\"The system has {num_patches} patches and a total of {total_holes} holes.\")\nprint(\"The number of logical qubits on a single surface code patch is equal to its number of holes.\")\nprint(\"For multiple patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of holes across all patches.\")\nprint()\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Maximum Logical Qubits = Total Number of Holes\")\n# We explicitly show the numbers in the final calculation.\nprint(f\"Maximum Logical Qubits = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\n# Redirect final answer to the special format, if not in an interactive environment\nif not sys.stdout.isatty():\n    print(f\"<<<{total_logical_qubits}>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
