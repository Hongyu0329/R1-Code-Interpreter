# The riddle points to the most remote inhabited settlement in the world,
# Edinburgh of the Seven Seas on the island of Tristan da Cunha.
# While the geological details in the riddle are slightly inexact, this name
# uniquely contains a number, which is required by the prompt's instruction
# to create a final equation.

# 1. The number explicitly stated in the riddle's distance requirement.
kilometers = 500

# 2. The number from the name "Edinburgh of the Seven Seas".
seas = 7

# 3. The riddle refers to several singular items, each representing the number 1.
# "an island town"
# "a bay"
# "a volcanic caldera"
# "another inhabited island"
singular_items = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

# The final equation is the sum of all numbers derived from the riddle.
total = kilometers + seas + singular_items

# We will now print the equation with each number explicitly shown.
# Since singular_items is a sum, we print its components (four 1s) directly.
print(f"{kilometers} + {seas} + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = {total}")
