    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, we use anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. Let's denote a single such variable by `η`. The property of these variables that mathematically encodes the Pauli exclusion principle is their nilpotency: `η² = 0`. This directly corresponds to the principle that a single quantum state cannot be occupied by two identical fermions.\n\nThe integration measure `dη` for these variables is not a value in itself, but rather is defined by the set of rules it follows, known as Berezin integration. For a single Grassmann variable, these rules are:\n\n1.  The integral of a constant is zero: `∫ 1 dη = 0`.\n2.  The integral of the variable itself is one: `∫ η dη = 1`.\n\nAny function of a single Grassmann variable can be expanded as `f(η) = A + Bη`, since all higher powers like `η²` are zero. Applying the integration rules, we find that `∫ f(η) dη = B`. The integral effectively selects the coefficient of the `η` term.\n\nThe value `1` is the result for integrating over a state with a single fermion (`η`), while a state with zero fermions (`A`) or two fermions (`η²=0`) gives zero. Therefore, `1` is the crucial value from the measure's definition that ensures a singly-occupied state has a normalized, non-zero contribution, thus upholding the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe following Python code prints out these fundamental rules and explicitly identifies the numbers in the equations as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_grassmann_integration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the defining rules of Berezin integration for a single Grassmann variable,\n    which are essential for fermionic path integrals and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The Berezin integration measure for a Grassmann variable 'eta' is defined by two fundamental rules.\")\n    print(\"These rules are consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle (which implies eta^2 = 0).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Rule 1: Integral of a constant ---\n    # This corresponds to the contribution from an empty state.\n    # The equation is: Integral(d_eta * 1) = 0\n    integrand_1 = 1\n    result_1 = 0\n    print(f\"Rule 1: The integral of a constant gives zero.\")\n    print(f\"   Equation: Integral(d_eta * {integrand_1}) = {result_1}\")\n    print(f\"   The numbers in this equation are: {integrand_1} and {result_1}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Rule 2: Integral of the variable itself ---\n    # This corresponds to the contribution from a singly-occupied state.\n    # The equation is: Integral(d_eta * eta) = 1\n    result_2 = 1\n    print(f\"Rule 2: The integral of the variable 'eta' itself is normalized to one.\")\n    print(f\"   Equation: Integral(d_eta * eta) = {result_2}\")\n    print(f\"   The number in this final equation is: {result_2}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis value of 1 is the measure's normalization for an occupied state.\")\n\nexplain_grassmann_integration()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
