    "For a successful multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, preparing the correct controls is absolutely critical for obtaining accurate and reproducible results. The controls are necessary for setting up the cytometer, compensating for spectral overlap between fluorophores, and accurately defining the populations to be sorted.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the number of essential controls:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the foundational control. A sample of your cells or beads without any fluorescent labels is used to measure the baseline autofluorescence and to help set the initial detector voltages (PMTs). You will need one of these.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** Since you are using five different fluorophores, there will be spectral overlap (one dye's signal spilling into another's detector). To correct for this, a process called compensation is required. You must prepare a separate control sample for each fluorophore used in your panel. This means five individual controls, each with only one of the five stains.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For sorting, the purity of your final sample is paramount. FMO controls are essential for setting precise gates. An FMO control contains all the fluorophores in your panel *except for one*. This helps you see how the other fluorophores spread into the \"empty\" channel, allowing you to accurately distinguish true positive signals from background spread, especially for dim markers or continuous expression patterns. For a robust 5-color sorting panel, you would prepare an FMO control for each of the five colors.\n\nBased on this, the total number of essential controls is the sum of unstained, single-stain, and FMO controls.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the experiment\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_colors = len(fluorophores)\n\n    # 1. Unstained control: to measure autofluorescence and set voltages.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-stain controls: for compensation. One for each color.\n    single_stain_controls = num_colors\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls: for accurate gate setting.\n    # Essential for sorting to ensure purity. One for each color.\n    fmo_controls = num_colors\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"To perform a rigorous 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare the following essential controls:\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"1.
