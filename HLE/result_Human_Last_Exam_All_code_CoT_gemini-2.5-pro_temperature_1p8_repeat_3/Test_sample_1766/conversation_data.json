    "Of course, I can help you with this spin-orbital coupling problem. Here is my plan to solve for the eigenvalues:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** A p-electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number `l = 1`. As an electron, its spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, results from the coupling of `l` and `s`. Its possible values are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series: `j` ranges from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalues of the operator $J^2$ are given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   For each value of `j`, the eigenvalues of the operator $J_z$ are given by $\\hbar m_j$, where `m_j` can take any value from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Python Script:** I will write a Python script that calculates these values systematically and prints the results in a clear format, showing the numbers used in each step of the calculation. I will use the `fractions` module for precision.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the results.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = fractions.Fraction(1, 2)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    # For l=1 and s=1/2, j can be 1/2 and 3/2\n    j_values = [j for j in (j_min, j_max)]\n\n    print(\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and Jz for a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2).\\n\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of J^2 are of the form j(j+1)hbar^2.\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of Jz are of the form m_j*hbar, where m_j = -j, -j+1, ..., +j.\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate and print the eigenvalues for each possible j\n    all_j2_eigenvalues = []\n    all_mj_eigenvalues = set()\n\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j_plus_1 = j + 1\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * j_plus_1\n        all_j2_eigenvalues.append(j2_eigenvalue)\n\n        # Determine possible m_j values\n        mj_values = []\n        current_mj = -j\n        while current_mj <= j:\n            mj_values.append(current_mj)\n            all_mj_eigenvalues.add(current_mj)\n            current_mj += 1\n\n        mj_values_str = \", \".join(map(str, mj_values))\n\n        # Print the results for the current j value\n        print(f\"For total angular momentum quantum number j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Print the J^2 eigenvalue calculation\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue equation for J^2 is: j*(j+1) * hbar^2\")\n        print(f\"  Substituting j = {j}, the eigenvalue is:\")\n        print(f\"    {j} * ({j} + 1) * hbar^2 = {j} * {j_plus_1} * hbar^2 = {j2_eigenvalue} * hbar^2\")\n\n        # Print the J_z eigenvalues\n        print(f\"  The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are m_j * hbar, where m_j can be:\")\n        print(f\"    {{{mj_values_str}}}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<J^2 eigenvalues (in hbar^2 units): 3/4, 15/4.
