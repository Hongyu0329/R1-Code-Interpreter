    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nThe problem asks for the number of independent parameters (variables) required to describe the bosonic sector of a particular physical model. In the language of non-linear sigma-models, this number is equal to the dimension of the model's target manifold.\n\n1.  **Identify the target manifold:** For the replica non-linear sigma-model describing disordered systems of symmetry class D with `n` replicas, the target space for the bosonic fields (the Goldstone modes) is the symmetric space `M = G/K = O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))`.\n2.  **Determine the dimension formula:** The dimension of such a space `G/K` is calculated as `dim(M) = dim(G) - dim(K)`.\n3.  **Find the dimension of the groups:** The dimension of an orthogonal group `O(N)` is given by the formula `dim(O(N)) = N * (N - 1) / 2`.\n4.  **Calculate the dimensions:** I will apply this formula to calculate the dimensions of `G = O(2n)` and `K = O(n) x O(n)`. The dimension of `K`, a direct product of two groups, is the sum of their individual dimensions.\n5.  **Substitute the given values:** The problem specifies `n=2` replicas.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** I will compute the final number by subtracting the dimension of `K` from the dimension of `G`.\n\nI will now write a Python script that implements this plan, showing the calculation step by step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_variables_class_d(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmann variables for the bosonic sector of the\n    supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with n replicas.\n\n    This corresponds to the dimension of the symmetric space O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Formula for the dimension of the orthogonal group O(N)\n    def dim_O(N):\n        return N * (N - 1) // 2\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the full group G = O(2n)\n    N_G = 2 * n\n    dim_G = dim_O(N_G)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the subgroup K = O(n) x O(n)\n    N_K_subgroup = n\n    # Dimension of K is dim(O(n)) + dim(O(n))\n    dim_K = 2 * dim_O(N_K_subgroup)\n\n    # Step 3: The number of variables is the dimension of the manifold, dim(G) - dim(K)\n    num_variables = dim_G - dim_K\n\n    # --- Outputting the results as requested ---\n    print(\"This problem asks for the number of bosonic variables for a sigma-model.\")\n    print(\"For symmetry class D with n replicas, the target space is the symmetric space O(2n)/(O(n) x O(n)).\")\n    print(\"The number of variables is the dimension of this space: dim(O(2n)) - (dim(O(n)) + dim(O(n))).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Steps ---\")\n    print(f\"Given number of replicas, n = {n}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\n1.
