    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Stats:** First, I will find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu boss in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I will determine the formula the game uses to scale boss health based on the number of players in the world. This is a specific multiplier for Expert Mode.\n3.  **Apply the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The core of the task is to apply the condition of an infinite number of players to this formula. This becomes a mathematical limit problem.\n4.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script that clearly states the formula, shows the base numbers involved, and explains the logical conclusion when the number of players approaches infinity. The script will print this explanation directly to the console.\n\nBased on the game's source code, the formula for boss health in Expert Mode multiplayer is a linear function of the number of players. There is no known upper limit or cap on this scaling. Therefore, as the number of players increases, the boss's health will increase without bound.\n\n```python\ndef explain_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with infinite players.\n    \"\"\"\n    base_health_expert = 3640\n    per_player_increase = 0.35\n\n    print(\"To find the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, we use the game's multiplayer health scaling formula.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Explain the formula structure\n    print(\"The formula is:\")\n    print(\"Total Health = Base Health * Health Multiplier\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere the Health Multiplier is calculated as:\")\n    print(\"Health Multiplier = 1 + (Per Player Increase * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Print the specific numbers for the equation\n    print(\"For the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode:\")\n    print(f\"Base Health = {base_health_expert}\")\n    print(f\"Per Player Increase = {per_player_increase}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSo the full equation for N players is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health_expert} * (1 + {per_player_increase} * (N - 1))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Explain the result with infinite players\n    print(\"The question asks for the health given an infinite number of players (N -> âˆž).\")\n    print(\"As N approaches infinity, the term '(N - 1)' also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"Since the health scales linearly with the number of players and there is no cap, the total health increases without bound.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The theoretical maximum health is infinite.\")\n\nexplain_max_health()\n```\n<<<Infinite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
