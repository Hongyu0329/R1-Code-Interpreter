    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we will follow a detailed plan based on the structure of this group and its relation to the special unitary group SU(4, 997).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Relate Involutions in PSU(n, q) to Elements in SU(n, q):**\n    The group PSU(n, q) is defined as the quotient group SU(n, q) / Z, where Z is the center of SU(n, q). An element `x = gZ` (where `g` is in SU(n, q)) is an involution in PSU(n, q) if it's not the identity and `x^2` is the identity. This means `g` is not in Z, and `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z` is the identity element of PSU(n, q), which is `Z`. This implies that `g^2` must be an element of the center Z.\n\n2.  **Determine the Center of SU(4, 997):**\n    The center Z of SU(n, q) consists of scalar matrices `ωI` such that `ω^n = 1` and `ω^(q+1) = 1`. This means `ω` must be a d-th root of unity, where `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    For our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`. So, `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499`, the greatest common divisor is 2.\n    Thus, `d = 2`. The center Z consists of `ωI` where `ω^2 = 1`. So, `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n3.  **Count Pre-images in SU(4, 997):**\n    We need to count the elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2` is in `{I, -I}` and `g` is not in `{I, -I}`. This breaks down into two cases:\n    *   **Case A: `g^2 = I`**. These are the involutions in SU(4, 997). Involutions in SU(4, q) (with `det=1`) are conjugate to diagonal matrices with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}` or `{-1, -1, -1, -1}`. The latter is the central element `-I`. The number of non-central involutions (with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`) is given by the size of their conjugacy class, which is `q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`. Let's call this number `N`.\n    *   **Case B: `g^2 = -I`**. These are \"skew-involutions\". Since `q = 997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, the square root of -1 (let's call it `i`) exists in the field `F_q`. These elements in SU(4, q) are conjugate to diagonal matrices with eigenvalues `{i, i, -i, -i}`, or the scalar matrices `iI` and `-iI`. The number of elements in the first class is also `N = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`. We also have the two central elements `iI` and `-iI` from the other classes which are not in Z.\n\n4.  **Count Involutions in PSU(4, 997):**\n    The projection from SU to PSU maps a pair of elements `{g, -g}` to a single element `gZ`.\n    *   The `N` involutions from Case A form `N/2` pairs of `{g, -g}`, giving `N/2` involutions in PSU.\n    *   The `N` skew-involutions from the main class in Case B form `N/2` pairs. The two scalar skew-involutions `{iI, -iI}` also form one pair. This gives `N/2 + 1` involutions in PSU.\n    *   The total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the sum: `(N/2) + (N/2 + 1) = N + 1`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The final formula is `Number = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1) + 1`. We will use Python to compute this for `q = 997`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The prime for the finite field\nq = 997\n\n# Calculate the terms of the formula for the number of involutions.\n# The formula is N = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1) + 1\nq_pow_2 = q**2\nq_pow_4 = q**4\nterm1 = q_pow_2 - q + 1\nterm2 = q_pow_2 + 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of involutions\nnum_involutions = q_pow_4 * term1 * term2 + 1\n\n# Print the formula and the calculated values\nprint(f\"The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q=997 is given by the formula:\")\nprint(f\"Number = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1) + 1\")\nprint(f\"Substituting q = {q}:\")\nprint(f\"Number = {q}^4 * ({q}^2 - {q} + 1) * ({q}^2 + 1) + 1\")\nprint(f\"Number = {q_pow_4} * ({q_pow_2} - {q} + 1) * ({q_pow_2} + 1) + 1\")\nprint(f\"Number = {q_pow_4} * {term1} * {term2} + 1\")\nprint(f\"Number = {q_pow_4 * term1 * term2} + 1\")\nprint(f\"Final Result = {num_involutions}\")\n\n```\n<<<981144203641738228301>>>"
