def find_nullified_propositions():
    """
    Identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing proposition.
    
    This function is based on research of the official voter guide which states:
    - Prop B and Prop C are competing measures.
    - Prop E and Prop G are competing measures.
    - Prop F and Prop I are competing measures.
    - Prop H and Prop K are competing measures.

    In each case, if both pass, the one with more 'yes' votes goes into effect,
    nullifying the other. Therefore, all propositions in these pairs could
    potentially be nullified.
