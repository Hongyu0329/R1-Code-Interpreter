    "The user is asking to identify a set of crystal classes that meet three specific criteria:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group must contain a mirror plane (m), an inversion center (i or -1), or a rotoinversion axis (-n).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a spontaneous electric dipole moment. This property belongs to all centrosymmetric crystal classes and some non-centrosymmetric classes where symmetry cancels out any potential dipole. The 10 classes that *can* be polar (pyroelectric) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Optically Active**: The crystal has the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. This physical property is, by definition, only present in **chiral** crystal classes.\n\nThere is a fundamental contradiction in the user's request: a crystal class cannot be both **achiral** and **optically active**. Because of this paradox, no answer choice can literally satisfy all conditions.\n\nHowever, we can solve this by finding the answer choice that best fits the plausible intent of the question. My plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Systematically check each crystal class in the answer choices against the definitions of achiral and non-polar.\n2.  Explicitly point out the contradiction regarding optical activity.\n3.  Identify the single answer choice where all classes satisfy the conditions of being achiral and non-polar, as this is the most likely intended answer to the flawed question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystal classes to find the set that is achiral and non-polar,\n    while addressing the user's paradoxical query about optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define properties for all crystal classes mentioned in the choices.\n    # Note: A class is optically active if and only if it is chiral.\n    # A class is non-polar if it is not in the set of 10 polar (pyroelectric) classes.\n    crystal_properties = {\n        # Class: {'is_chiral': bool, 'is_polar': bool}\n        'm':    {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True},\n        'mm2':  {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True},\n        '-6':   {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False},\n        '-62m': {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False},\n        '-43m': {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False},\n        '3m':   {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True},\n        '4mm':  {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True},\n        '6mm':  {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': True},\n        '-4':   {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False},\n        '-42m': {'is_chiral': False, 'is_polar': False},\n        '1':    {'is_chiral': True,  'is_polar': True},\n        '2':    {'is_chiral': True,  'is_polar': True},\n        '3':    {'is_chiral': True,  'is_polar': True},\n        '4':    {'is_chiral': True,  'is_polar': True},\n        '6':    {'is_chiral': True,  'is_polar': True}\n    }\n\n    answer_choices = {\n        'A': ['m', 'mm2'],\n        'B': ['-6', '-62m', '-43m'],\n        'C': ['3m', '4mm', '6mm'],\n        'D': ['-4', '-42m'],\n        'E': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '6']\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Crystal Class Properties ---\\n\")\n    print(\"The user asks for classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\")\n    print(\"CRITICAL POINT: Optical activity requires a CHIRAL structure.
