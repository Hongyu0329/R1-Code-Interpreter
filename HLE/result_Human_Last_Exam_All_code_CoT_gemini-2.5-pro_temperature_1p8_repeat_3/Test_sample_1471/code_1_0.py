# Step 1: Define the numbers from the equation in modern form.
num1 = 48  # This corresponds to 'പ്പെ'
num2 = 30  # This corresponds to '𒌋𒌋𒌋'
num3 = 23  # This corresponds to '𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹'

# Step 2: Perform the calculation.
# Following the order of operations, division is performed first, then subtraction.
result = num1 / num2 - num3

# Step 3: Print the translated equation and the result.
print(f"The equation in modern numbers is: {num1} / {num2} - {num3}")
print(f"The solution is: {result}")
