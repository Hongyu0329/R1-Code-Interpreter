    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Numerals:** The numbers in the equation are written in Babylonian cuneiform.\n2.  **Translate to Modern Numbers:**\n    *   `പ്പെ` represents the number 48. It is composed of four `𒌋` symbols (each meaning 10) and eight `𒁹` symbols (each meaning 1).\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒌋` represents the number 30. It is composed of three `𒌋` symbols (each meaning 10).\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹` represents the number 23. It is composed of two `𒌋` symbols (10 each) and three `𒁹` symbols (1 each).\n3.  **Re-write the Equation:** The equation `പ്പെ/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹` translates to `48 / 30 - 23` in modern numbers.\n4.  **Solve the Equation:** I will use Python to perform the calculation following the order of operations (division before subtraction).\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the equation:\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the numbers from the equation in modern form.\nnum1 = 48  # This corresponds to 'പ്പെ'\nnum2 = 30  # This corresponds to '𒌋𒌋𒌋'\nnum3 = 23  # This corresponds to '𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹'\n\n# Step 2: Perform the calculation.\n# Following the order of operations, division is performed first, then subtraction.\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Step 3: Print the translated equation and the result.\nprint(f\"The equation in modern numbers is: {num1} / {num2} - {num3}\")\nprint(f\"The solution is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<-21.4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
