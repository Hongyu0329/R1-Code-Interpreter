# The reasoning for the solution is primarily based on topological and fractal geometry concepts.
# This code is a formal representation of the conclusion derived from the mathematical analysis.

# The set F is given by F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4.
# D = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),(0,3),(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),(3,3)}

# Step 1: Analyze the structure of F.
# The x-projection of F is the Cantor set C generated by contractions x -> x/4 and x -> (x+3)/4.
# The y-projection of F is the interval [0,1].
# Because the choice of y-coordinates is independent of the choice of x-coordinates,
# the set F is the Cartesian product F = C x [0,1].

# Step 2: Find the components of F.
# The connected components of the product of a totally disconnected set (C) and a connected set ([0,1])
# are the "fibers" {c} x [0,1] for each c in C.
# The Cantor set C has uncountably many points, so F has uncountably many components.

# Step 3: Identify the components that are nondegenerate and locally connected.
# All components are line segments, so they are all nondegenerate.
# The local connectivity of a component {c} x [0,1] depends on the nature of the point c in C.
# For a component to be locally connected, the point c cannot be a limit point from both sides within C.
# This condition holds only for the endpoints of the Cantor set C.
# The minimum element of C is 0 (code 0,0,0,...).
# The maximum element of C is 1 (code 3,3,3,... because sum(3/4^k) for k=1 to inf is 1).
# The two components corresponding to these endpoints are {0} x [0,1] and {1} x [0,1].

num_nondegenerate_lc_components = 2

# Final answer is the number of such components.
print(f"The number of components that are nondegenerate and locally connected is {num_nondegenerate_lc_components}.")
