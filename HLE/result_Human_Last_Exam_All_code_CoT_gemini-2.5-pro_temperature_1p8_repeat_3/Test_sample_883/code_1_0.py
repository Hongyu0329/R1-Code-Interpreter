    # The two primary questions concern the function of Al1 and Rga1.
    # From our analysis:
    # - Al1 is an allosteric activator. Al2 is an allosteric inhibitor. They bind to the same site.
    # - Rga1 is an inhibitor whose effect is not reversed by substrate (consistent with irreversible or non-competitive reversible inhibition).
    #
    # Let's check the answer choices:
    # A: Plausible, but misses the key finding about the shared binding site for Al1/Al2.
    # B: Incorrect, CaCl2 is not a cofactor.
    # C: Al1/Al2 as allosteric modulators (Correct). They bind to the same site (Correct). Rga1 as an irreversible inhibitor (A plausible interpretation of the data). This is a very strong candidate.
    # D: Incorrect, XAG1 is a reversible inhibitor because its effect is overcome by substrate (kcat from 10 to 450).
    # E: Incorrect, C is a good answer.
    # F: Incorrect, CaCl2 and CuCl2 are not cofactors.
    # G: Incorrect, Al2 is an inhibitor, not an activator.
    # H: Plausible, but weaker than C. It uses timid language ("may function") and misses the conclusion about the binding site.
