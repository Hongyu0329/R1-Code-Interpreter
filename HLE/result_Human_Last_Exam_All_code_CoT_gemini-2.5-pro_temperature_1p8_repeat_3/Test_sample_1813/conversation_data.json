    "To find the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\), we first need to identify the number itself. The notation \\(m_{p/q}\\) typically refers to a specific quadratic irrational number whose properties are related to the Diophantine approximation of rational numbers near \\(p/q\\). A common definition, based on the work of Frobenius, relates \\(m_{p/q}\\) to the roots of a specific quadratic equation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)**: For \\(m_{4/7}\\), we have \\(p=4\\) and \\(q=7\\).\n\n2.  **Find the modular inverse**: We need to find an integer \\(p'\\) such that \\(pp' \\equiv 1 \\pmod q\\). For \\(p=4, q=7\\), we solve \\(4p' \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7\\). We find that \\(4 \\times 2 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7\\), so \\(p' = 2\\).\n\n3.  **Construct the Frobenius quadratic equation**: The number, let's call it \\(z\\), is a root of the equation \\(q z^2 - (3q - 2p')z + (3p' - p - \\frac{1+p'^2}{q}) = 0\\).\n    Substituting the values \\(p=4, q=7, p'=2\\):\n    \\(7z^2 - (3 \\cdot 7 - 2 \\cdot 2)z + (3 \\cdot 2 - 4 - \\frac{1+2^2}{7}) = 0\\)\n    \\(7z^2 - (21 - 4)z + (6 - 4 - \\frac{5}{7}) = 0\\)\n    \\(7z^2 - 17z + (2 - \\frac{5}{7}) = 0\\)\n    \\(7z^2 - 17z + \\frac{9}{7} = 0\\)\n    Multiplying the entire equation by 7 to clear the fraction, we get:\n    \\(49z^2 - 119z + 9 = 0\\)\n\n4.  **Solve the quadratic equation**: We use the quadratic formula to find the roots of \\(Az^2+Bz+C=0\\), which are \\(z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\\).\n    For our equation, \\(A=49, B=-119, C=9\\). The discriminant is \\(D_{eq} = (-119)^2 - 4(49)(9) = 14161 - 1764 = 12397\\).\n    The roots are \\(z = \\frac{119 \\pm \\sqrt{12397}}{2 \\cdot 49} = \\frac{119 \\pm \\sqrt{12397}}{98}\\).\n    The generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is the larger of these two roots, so \\(m_{4/7} = \\frac{119 + \\sqrt{12397}}{98}\\).\n\n5.  **Compute the continued fraction**: Since \\(m_{4/7}\\) is a quadratic irrational, its continued fraction is periodic. We can use the standard PQa algorithm to find the coefficients of the continued fraction for a number of the form \\(\\frac{P_0 + \\sqrt{D}}{Q_0}\\).\n    Here, \\(P_0 = 119\\), \\(D = 12397\\), and \\(Q_0 = 98\\). The algorithm proceeds by repeatedly calculating the next integer coefficient and the next state \\((P_i, Q_i)\\) until a state repeats.\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm to find and print the continued fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generalized_markov_cf(p_frac, q_frac):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction of the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Find modular inverse p' such that p*p' === 1 (mod q)\n    try:\n        # This function is available in Python 3.8+\n        pp_inv = pow(p_frac, -1, q_frac)\n    except AttributeError:\n        # Fallback for older Python versions\n        def egcd(a, b):\n            if a == 0:\n                return (b, 0, 1)\n            g, y, x = egcd(b % a, a)\n            return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)\n\n        def modinv(a, m):\n            g, x, y = egcd(a, m)\n            if g != 1:\n                raise Exception('modular inverse does not exist')\n            return x % m\n        pp_inv = modinv(p_frac, q_frac)\n    \n    # Step 2: Use Frobenius's formula to get the quadratic equation Az^2+Bz+C=0\n    # The coefficients are simplified after multiplying by q_frac.\n    A = q_frac**2\n    B = -(3 * q_frac**2 - 2 * pp_inv * q_frac)\n    C = (3 * pp_inv * q_frac - p_frac * q_frac - (pp_inv**2 + 1))\n    \n    # The number is the larger root: z = (-B + sqrt(B^2-4AC))/(2A)\n    # Match this to the PQa algorithm's input: (P0 + sqrt(D))/Q0\n    D_sqrt = B**2 - 4*A*C\n    P0 = -B\n    Q0 = 2*A\n\n    # Step 3: PQa Algorithm to compute the continued fraction\n    coeffs = []\n    seen_states = {}\n    \n    pi = P0\n    qi = Q0\n    \n    # Loop until a state (pi, qi) repeats\n    while (pi, qi) not in seen_states:\n        seen_states[(pi, qi)] = len(coeffs)\n        \n        # Calculate the next coefficient\n        ai = int((pi + math.sqrt(D_sqrt)) / qi)\n        coeffs.append(ai)\n        \n        # Calculate the next state\n        pi_next = ai * qi - pi\n        qi_next = (D_sqrt - pi_next**2) // qi\n        \n        pi = pi_next\n        qi = qi_next\n        \n    # The period starts where the state first repeated\n    period_start_index = seen_states[(pi, qi)]\n    non_periodic_part = coeffs[:period_start_index]\n    periodic_part = coeffs[period_start_index:]\n    \n    return non_periodic_part, periodic_part\n\n# Main execution\np, q = 4, 7\nnon_periodic, periodic = generalized_markov_cf(p, q)\n\n# Print the final results as requested\nprint(f\"The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{p}/{q} is:\")\n\n# Constructing the output string\nresult_string = f\"[{non_periodic[0]}; (\"\nresult_string += \", \".join(map(str, periodic))\nresult_string += \")]\"\nprint(result_string)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe coefficients of the continued fraction are:\")\nfull_coeffs = non_periodic + periodic\nprint(f\"a_0 = {non_periodic[0]}\")\n# To fulfill the requirement of printing each coefficient of the final equation\nfor i in range(len(periodic)):\n    # Index relative to start of CF\n    idx = i + len(non_periodic)\n    print(f\"a_{idx} = {periodic[i]}\")\n\n```\n<<<[2; (2, 1, 5, 1, 5, 111, 5, 1, 5, 1, 2)]>>>"
