    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of the Conductor:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. Since a Dirichlet character is primitive with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ (a product of distinct primes), it can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the prime $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character, meaning its order is greater than 1.\n\n2.  **Order of a Character Product:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We need this lcm to be exactly 6. This implies that the order of each component, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n\n3.  **Counting Using Inclusion-Exclusion:** We will count the number of valid character tuples $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$. To find the number of tuples where the lcm of orders is exactly 6, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let $N(m)$ be the number of tuples where the lcm of the orders of the primitive characters divides $m$. The number of characters with order exactly 6 is then $N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$.\n\n4.  **Calculating N(m):** For the lcm of orders to divide $m$, the order of each character component $\\chi_i$ must divide $m$. The order of a character modulo $p_i$ must also divide $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$. So, for each prime factor $p_i$, we count the number of primitive characters modulo $p_i$ whose order divides both $m$ and $p_i-1$. This count is the sum of $\\phi(k)$ for all $k > 1$ that divide $\\text{gcd}(m, p_i-1)$. The total count $N(m)$ is the product of these counts for all prime factors $p_i$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"Main function to solve the problem.\"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order_k = 6\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order {order_k}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization\n    print(\"Step 1: Find the prime factorization of d.\")\n    factors_d = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = sorted(factors_d.keys())\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {d} is {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}.\")\n    print(\"Since d is square-free, a character is primitive with conductor d if and only if it is a product of non-principal characters for each prime factor.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Explain method\n    print(\"Step 2: Use Inclusion-Exclusion to find characters of order exactly 6.\")\n    print(\"The number of such characters is given by the formula: N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1), where N(m) is the number of primitive character tuples whose order's lcm divides m.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate N(m) for divisors of k\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate N(m) for each divisor m of 6.\")\n    \n    divs_of_k = get_divisors(order_k)\n    phi_vals = {i: phi(i) for i in range(1, order_k + 1)}\n    \n    term_values = {}\n\n    for m in divs_of_k:\n        print(f\"--- Calculating N({m}) ---\")\n        \n        counts_per_prime = []\n        for p in primes:\n            p_minus_1 = p - 1\n            common_divisors_gcd = math.gcd(m, p_minus_1)\n            \n            count = 0\n            # Iterate through divisors of gcd(m, p-1)\n            divs_of_gcd = get_divisors(common_divisors_gcd)\n            for k_div in divs_of_gcd:\n                if k_div > 1:  # Must be primitive (order > 1)\n                    count += phi_vals.get(k_div, 0)\n            \n            counts_per_prime.append(count)\n            print(f\"For p={p}, the number of primitive characters with order dividing {m} is {count}.\")\n        \n        N_m = 1\n        for count in counts_per_prime:\n            N_m *= count\n        \n        term_values[m] = N_m\n        print(f\"N({m}) = {' * '.join(map(str, counts_per_prime))} = {N_m}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Final calculation\n    result = term_values.get(6, 0) - term_values.get(3, 0) - term_values.get(2, 0) + term_values.get(1, 0)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Final Calculation.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of primitive characters of order 6 is:\")\n    print(f\"N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1) = {term_values[6]} - {term_values[3]} - {term_values[2]} + {term_values[1]}\")\n    print(f\"= {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<608>>>"
