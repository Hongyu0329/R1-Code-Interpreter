    "To solve this, I will analyze the mechanics of each ballet step provided in the answer choices. The goal is to identify which step finishes in the exact same leg position as it started. This means if a dancer starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, they must also end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of each option:\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump starting from fifth position. The legs open and close (beat) three times in the air, for a total of six movements. Jumps with an even number of beats (like *quatre* or *six*) land on two feet in the same position they started from. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are identical.\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word *changé* literally means \"changed.\" The dancer jumps from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (second) and then back to the closed position, but with the opposite foot in front. The position changes.\n3.  **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out, jumping off the supporting leg, and bringing both legs together to land in fifth position. This action typically results in a change of which foot is in front.\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding step. Starting from fifth, the back foot glides out, and the front foot closes *behind* it (*derrière*). This action changes which foot is in front.\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a *pas de chat* but with circular movements (*ronds de jambe*) of both legs in the air. The landing changes the starting position.\n\nBased on this analysis, **Entrechat six** is the correct answer. The following Python code programmatically verifies this logic.\n\n```python\ndef find_correct_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to determine which one ends in the same\n    leg position it started from.
