  This function solves the riddle about the shape of the high schools in Pisa.

  By observing the satellite imagery of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and
  Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini on Via Benedetto Croce in Pisa,
  one can see their buildings form a distinct letter. The long building of
  Liceo Dini forms the vertical spine, and the sections of the
  Galilei-Pacinotti building form the three horizontal bars.
