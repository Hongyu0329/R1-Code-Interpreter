    Calculates the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry based on the problem's hypothetical constraints.
    
    An asymmetry is generated if the number of neutrinos produced is different from
    the number of antineutrinos produced. This typically requires the underlying
    physical decay rates to be different (a manifestation of CP violation).
    
    The problem statement provides a crucial hypothetical rule:
    "the decay rates into neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same".
    
    This script models that condition to determine the resulting asymmetry.
