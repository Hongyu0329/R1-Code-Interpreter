    Solves the math problem to find the value of d.
    
    The problem solving process is as follows:
    1.  Determine the relationship between a1 and d from the condition that {b_n} is an AP.
        b_n = (n^2 + n) / a_n, where a_n = a1 + (n-1)*d
        The condition 2*b_2 = b_1 + b_3 gives:
        12 / (a1 + d) = 2/a1 + 12/(a1 + 2d)
        Solving this leads to a_1^2 - 3*a_1*d + 2*d^2 = 0,
        which factors to (a1 - d)(a1 - 2d) = 0.
        This gives two cases: a1 = d or a1 = 2d.
    2.  Test each case with the condition S_99 - T_99 = 99.
