    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem is to evaluate the quantum mechanical integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ where $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are 1s Slater-type orbitals (STOs). The phrasing \"for a 1s Slater orbital\" implies that both orbitals are the same, so $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi_{1s}$. This integral represents the potential energy due to the attraction between an electron described by the orbital $\\phi_{1s}$ and a nucleus of charge +1 (in atomic units).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Orbital**: A 1s Slater orbital is mathematically represented as $\\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) = N e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent and $N$ is the normalization constant.\n2.  **Normalize**: We first find the value of $N$ by ensuring the probability of finding the electron somewhere in space is 1. This is done by solving the normalization condition $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle = 1$.\n3.  **Set up the Integral**: We will set up the integral for $V_{11} = \\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$. The integration is performed over all space in spherical coordinates ($d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$).\n4.  **Evaluate**: The Python code below will use the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform the integration step-by-step. It will first calculate the normalization constant and then use the normalized orbital to compute the final integral, showing how the different parts of the calculation combine to produce the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, integrate, pi, oo, sqrt, sin, Mul, Pow\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a Slater-type orbital.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for spherical coordinates (r, theta, phi) and the orbital exponent (zeta)\n    r, theta, phi = symbols('r theta phi')\n    zeta = symbols('zeta', positive=True)\n\n    # 1.
