    print("Step 1: Understand the given information.")
    print("  - Organism: Drosophila melanogaster.")
    print("  - Offspring in question: A male with an unexpected phenotype (red eyes, miniature wings).")
    print("  - Offspring's chromosomal makeup: X0 (one X chromosome, no Y chromosome).")

    # Step 2: Determine the parental contributions based on Drosophila genetics.
    print("\nStep 2: Determine the parental source of the chromosomes.")
    print("  - In Drosophila, an X0 individual is a sterile male. The offspring is male as stated.")
    print("  - The offspring has only one X chromosome. All of its X-linked traits, like eye color and wing shape, must come from this single chromosome.")
    print("  - In Bridges' experiments, he would cross flies with different X-linked traits. For the exceptional male to have a paternal trait (e.g., red eyes from a red-eyed father), he must have received his X chromosome from the father.")
    print("  - To form an X0 zygote, the paternal X-bearing sperm must have fertilized a maternal gamete (egg) that had no sex chromosome.")

    # Step 3: Identify the genetic event causing the abnormal maternal gamete.
    print("\nStep 3: Identify the meiotic error in the mother.")
    print("  - An egg with no sex chromosome is called a nullo-X egg.")
    print("  - This type of egg is produced by an error in meiosis called non-disjunction, where the X chromosomes fail to separate correctly.")
    print("  - Since the egg is the female gamete, the non-disjunction event must have occurred during oogenesis (meiosis in the female).")
    
    # Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the deduction.
    print("\nStep 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.")
    print("  - This reasoning eliminates choice C (male meiosis), D (autosomes), and E (mutation).")
    print("  - We are left with choice A (non-disjunction in female meiosis I) and B (non-disjunction in female meiosis II).")
    print("  - Both events can produce nullo-X eggs. However, Bridges observed both X0 males and XXY females as exceptions. Non-disjunction of the homologous X chromosomes during Meiosis I is the single event that creates both n+1 (leading to XXY) and n-1 (leading to X0) gametes from that meiotic division.")
    print("  - It is the classic and most comprehensive explanation for the full scope of Bridges' results.")

    # Step 5: Final conclusion.
    print("\nConclusion: The most specific and explanatory event is the non-disjunction of the X chromosome during female meiosis I.")
