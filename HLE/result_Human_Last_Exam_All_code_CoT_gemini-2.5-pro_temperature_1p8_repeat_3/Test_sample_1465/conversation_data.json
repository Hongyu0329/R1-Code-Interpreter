    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the oligomeric state of the provided protein sequences:\n\n1.  **Identify the Coiled-Coil Register:** Coiled-coils are formed by repeating units of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, dictating its oligomeric state. The first step is to identify which amino acids in the sequence occupy these 'a' and 'd' positions. I will analyze the sequence patterns to find the most likely heptad register. The pattern `E-I-A-x-A-L-K` suggests a common backbone. The most chemically sensible register, placing hydrophobic residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions, is `(fgabcdef)`. This places the 'a' residue at the 3rd position of the sequence pattern (`A`, `Q`) and the 'd' residue at the 6th position (`L`, `K`, `I`, `T`).\n\n2.  **Extract Core Residues:** For each of the five sequences, I will extract the amino acids located at all the 'a' and 'd' positions based on the identified register.\n\n3.  **Apply Oligomerization Rules:** The specific combination of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions determines the preferred oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.). These rules are based on well-established principles from experimental studies on protein design (e.g., by Harbury, Kim, and Alber). I will apply these rules to the core residues extracted from each sequence.\n    *   **Dimer (2-helix bundle):** Often formed by combinations like (a=Ala, d=Leu) or when polar residues are present in the core (a=Gln, d=Leu).\n    *   **Trimer (3-helix bundle):** Favored by combinations like (a=Ala, d=Thr) or (a=Ile, d=Leu).\n    *   **Tetramer (4-helix bundle):** Favored by bulky hydrophobic residues like (a=Ala, d=Ile) or (a=Ile, d=Ile).\n\n4.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script that automates this process. The script will:\n    a. Store the input sequences.\n    b. For each sequence, identify the 'a' and 'd' residues based on the `(fgabcdef)` register.\n    c. Use a series of `if/elif` conditions to implement the oligomerization rules.\n    d. Store the predicted state for each sequence.\n    e. Print the final list of predicted oligomeric states.\n\n```python\ndef predict_oligomeric_states():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on the residues\n    at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",  # Expects a=A, d=L -> Dimer\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",  # Expects a=A, d=K -> Dimer (destabilized)\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",  # Expects a=A, d=I/W -> Tetramer\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",  # Expects a=Q, d=L -> Dimer (polar zipper)\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\",  # Expects a=A, d=T -> Trimer\n    ]\n\n    oligomeric_states = []\n\n    for seq in sequences:\n        # Based on analysis, the most likely heptad register is (fgabcdef).\n        # This places 'a' at indices 2, 9, 16, 23 and 'd' at 5, 12, 19, 26.\n        a_indices = [2, 9, 16, 23]\n        d_indices = [5, 12, 19, 26]\n\n        # Use a set to find the unique residues at each core position.\n        a_residues = set(seq[i] for i in a_indices)\n        d_residues = set(seq[i] for i in d_indices)\n\n        state = \"Unknown\"\n\n        # Apply rules based on established principles of coiled-coil design.\n        # Rule for Sequence 1: a=A, d=L strongly favors dimers.\n        if a_residues == {'A'} and d_residues == {'L'}:\n            state = 2\n        # Rule for Sequence 2: a=A, d=K.
