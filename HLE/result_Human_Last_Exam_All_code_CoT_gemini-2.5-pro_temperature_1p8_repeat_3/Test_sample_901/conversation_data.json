    "The user wants me to identify the product of a chemical reaction and present the answer using a Python script.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane with a bromine (leaving group) and a methyl group. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) tells me the two groups are *trans* to each other.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol. This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** A secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base will undergo an E2 (elimination, bimolecular) reaction.\n\n2.  **Apply E2 Mechanism Rules to Cyclohexane:**\n    *   The E2 reaction requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) being removed must be *anti-periplanar*.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a *trans-diaxial* arrangement. Both the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must be in axial positions.\n\n3.  **Perform Conformational Analysis:**\n    *   A *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist as two chair conformers: one with both substituents equatorial (e,e) and one with both substituents axial (a,a).\n    *   The (e,e) conformer is much more stable because bulky groups prefer the equatorial position to avoid steric strain.\n    *   The (a,a) conformer is much less stable.\n    *   Let's check which conformer can react.\n        *   **Stable (e,e) Conformer:** The bromine is equatorial. An equatorial leaving group cannot be trans-diaxial to any beta-hydrogen. Therefore, **no reaction can occur from this stable conformer.**\n        *   **Unstable (a,a) Conformer:** The molecule must flip into its less stable conformation for the reaction to proceed. Here, the bromine is axial. This is the reactive conformation.\n\n4.  **Determine the Regiochemistry (Which H is removed?):**\n    *   Now that we've established the reaction happens from the conformation where Br is axial (and the methyl group is also axial), we need to find an axial beta-hydrogen.\n    *   The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n        *   **At C2:** This carbon has the axial methyl group. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 must be equatorial. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it cannot be eliminated.\n        *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1. This is the hydrogen that the base will remove.\n\n5.  **Identify the Product:**\n    *   Elimination of the axial H from C6 and the axial Br from C1 forms a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The methyl group on C2 remains.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group. To name it, we number the ring starting from the double bond, giving the substituent the lowest possible number. The double bond is C1-C2 (using new numbering), and the methyl group is on C3.\n    *   The product name is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the only possible product due to the strict stereochemical requirements of the E2 reaction.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the reaction type.\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the reaction\")\n    print(\"Substrate: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (a secondary alkyl halide)\")\n    print(\"Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\")\n    print(\"This combination strongly favors an E2 elimination reaction.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the stereochemical requirement for E2 on a cyclohexane.\n    print(\"Step 2: E2 Mechanism Requirement\")\n    print(\"The E2 reaction requires an anti-periplanar arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (H).\")\n    print(\"In a cyclohexane chair, this means they must be in a trans-diaxial orientation (both axial, one pointing up, one down).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the conformations of the starting material.\n    print(\"Step 3: Conformational Analysis\")\n    print(\"The starting material, a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, exists in two chair conformations:\")\n    print(\"  a) Br equatorial, CH3 equatorial (more stable)\")\n    print(\"  b) Br axial, CH3 axial (less stable)\")\n    print(\"For the E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (Br) must be in the axial position.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the less stable (b) conformation.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Determine which beta-hydrogen can be eliminated.\n    print(\"Step 4: Identifying the Correct Beta-Hydrogen\")\n    print(\"In the reactive conformation (Br axial, CH3 axial), we look at the two adjacent carbons (beta-carbons): C2 and C6.\")\n    print(\"  - At C2: The methyl group is axial, so the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial.
