    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we first need to identify the correct formula. The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau threefold `X` (given by a single polynomial equation in a 5-variable weighted projective space) is a topological invariant defined as the integral of the second Chern class of the tangent bundle of `X` capped with the hyperplane class `H`.\n\nFor a Calabi-Yau hypersurface `X` of degree `d` in the weighted projective space `P(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)`, the invariant is calculated using the following steps:\n\n1.  **Verify the Calabi-Yau condition**: The degree of the defining polynomial, `d`, must equal the sum of the weights of the ambient space, i.e., `d = w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + w5`.\n2.  **Identify the formula**: Based on the adjunction formula for Chern classes, the invariant for a quasi-smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface is given by:\n    `CN(X) = (d * Σ₂) / (w1 * w2 * w3 * w4 * w5)`\n    where `Σ₂ = Σ_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ 5} wᵢwⱼ` is the sum of all pairwise products of the weights.\n3.  **Calculate the components**:\n    *   The weights are given as `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n    *   The degree `d` is the sum of the weights: `d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`. (This matches the degree of the given polynomial, assuming a typo correction for one term).\n    *   Calculate `Σ₂`, the sum of pairwise products of the weights.\n    *   Calculate `Πwᵢ`, the product of all weights.\n4.  **Compute the final value**: Substitute the calculated values into the formula and simplify the resulting fraction.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to compute the invariant.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface\n    in a weighted projective space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
