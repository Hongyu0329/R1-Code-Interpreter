    "To determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant mathematical theorem.** A fundamental result by T.A. Springer and R. Steinberg in the theory of linear algebraic groups provides the answer. It states that for any connected reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of maximal tori that are rational over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is equal to the order of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Weyl group for the given group type.** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$, so its associated Weyl group is $W(E_8)$. The answer to the question is therefore the order of this group, $|W(E_8)|$.\n\n3.  **Find the formula for the order of W(E_8).** The order of the Weyl group for $E_8$ is a well-known constant in Lie theory. Its prime factorization is given by:\n    $|W(E_8)| = 2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the value.** We will use a Python script to compute this product and display the result, showing each component of the calculation as requested.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_e8_tori_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n    This number is equal to the order of the Weyl group W(E_8).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The order of the Weyl group W(E_8) is given by the product:\n    # 2^14 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7\n    p1 = 2\n    e1 = 14\n    n1 = p1**e1\n\n    p2 = 3\n    e2 = 5\n    n2 = p2**e2\n\n    p3 = 5\n    e3 = 2\n    n3 = p3**e3\n\n    p4 = 7\n    e4 = 1\n    n4 = p4**e4\n\n    # Calculate the total number\n    total_number = n1 * n2 * n3 * n4\n\n    # Print the explanation and the calculation\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a group of type E_8 is given by the order of its Weyl group, |W(E_8)|.\")\n    print(\"The formula for the order is: 2^14 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's calculate the value of each term in the final equation:\")\n    print(f\"{p1}^{e1} = {n1}\")\n    print(f\"{p2}^{e2} = {n2}\")\n    print(f\"{p3}^{e3} = {n3}\")\n    print(f\"{p4}^{e4} = {n4}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nNow, we multiply these numbers together to get the final result.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {n1} * {n2} * {n3} * {n4} = {total_number}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G is {total_number}.\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_e8_tori_number()\n```\n<<<696729600>>>"
