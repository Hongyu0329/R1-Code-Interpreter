# The clinical presentation is classic for metastatic melanoma.
# A changing mole (primary lesion) is noted.
# Evidence of widespread metastasis includes:
# - New dark spots (skin metastases)
# - Hip ache (likely bone metastasis)
# - Pericardial effusion with malignant cells (pericardial metastasis)
# - Systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss.

# The immediate life-threatening condition, cardiac tamponade, has been managed with pericardiocentesis.
# The next step must address the underlying systemic disease.

# Let's evaluate the options:
# A. Meloxicam: Symptomatic relief, does not treat cancer.
# B. Low-dose analgesia: Symptomatic relief, does not treat cancer.
# C. None of the choices: To be selected if all others are wrong.
# D. Chemotherapy: A systemic therapy designed to kill cancer cells throughout the body. This is a correct approach for metastatic cancer.
# E. Immunosuppression: Contraindicated. Melanoma is often treated by stimulating the immune system (immunotherapy).
# F. Antibiotics: No evidence of infection.
# G. Radiotherapy: A local treatment, not suitable for widespread metastatic disease.
# H. Diuretics: Symptomatic relief for fluid overload but doesn't treat the cause.

# The most appropriate next step to manage the underlying cause of the patient's condition is systemic therapy.
# Chemotherapy is the correct choice representing this class of treatment.

explanation = "The patient has widespread metastatic melanoma. After stabilizing the immediate life-threatening cardiac tamponade with pericardiocentesis, the next best step is to start systemic therapy to control the cancer throughout the body. Chemotherapy is a form of systemic therapy aimed at killing malignant cells and is the most appropriate choice among the given options."
