    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady-state is reached as time $t \\to +\\infty$, at which point the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. This means their time derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, are equal to zero.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Set derivatives to zero:** We start by setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$ in the given system of differential equations to find the equilibrium conditions.\n2.  **Correct the system equation:** There appears to be a typo in the provided equation for $P_1'(t)$. In a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the term $\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ represents the flow of probability from state 0 to state 1, which should contribute positively to the rate of change of $P_1(t)$. The provided negative sign ($-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$) leads to a solution where all probabilities are zero, which contradicts the condition that they must sum to 1. We will proceed by using the standard, physically correct formulation with a positive sign:\n    $$ P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\n3.  **Form a system of linear equations:** Setting the derivatives to zero gives us a system of algebraic equations. We will use three of these equations along with the normalization condition ($P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$) to form a complete, solvable system of four linear equations for the four unknown probabilities ($P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$).\n    The resulting equations are:\n    *   $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3} = 0$\n    *   $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n4.  **Solve the system:** We will use a Python script with the `NumPy` library to solve this system of linear equations for the values of $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n5.  **Calculate the final result:** Once we have the individual steady-state probabilities, we will compute their sum, $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- 1.
