# Statement E is false.
# A strictly convex function is guaranteed to have AT MOST ONE global minimum, but it is not guaranteed to have one.
# For example, f(x) = e^x is strictly convex, but it never reaches a minimum value. It approaches an infimum of 0 but never attains it.
# This script demonstrates this counterexample.

# Generate x values
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 400)
# Calculate y values for the strictly convex function f(x) = e^x
y = np.exp(x)

# Create the plot
