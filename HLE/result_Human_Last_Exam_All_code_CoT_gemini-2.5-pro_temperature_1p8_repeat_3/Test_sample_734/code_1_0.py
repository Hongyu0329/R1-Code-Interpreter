        "Augustine of Hippo is the theologian who first developed a sophisticated framework to describe what appear to be changes in the laws of nature. "
        "He did not see miracles as God 'breaking' natural law. Instead, he argued that what we perceive as 'the laws of nature' is simply the usual, 'customary course of nature.'\n\n"
        "His specialized terminology includes the concept of 'seminal reasons' or 'causal principles' (rationes seminales), which he argued God embedded within creation from the beginning. "
        "From this perspective:\n"
        "1. The virgin birth of Jesus was not a violation of nature, but the activation by God of a latent potential that had always existed within His creation, outside of its usual course.\n"
        "2. The alterations to the natural world at the Fall (e.g., thorns, thistles, pain in childbirth) could be understood as God altering the 'customary course' of nature in response to sin, activating different principles according to His sovereign will.\n\n"
        "Thus, Augustine's framework allows for both unique miracles and systematic changes in nature's operation without seeing them as God contradicting the ultimate order He authored."
