    # The optimal strategy is to divide the 9 individuals into two groups.
    # One group (e.g., 5 people) assumes the total parity of a hat color is even.
    # The other group (4 people) assumes the parity is odd.
    # If the true parity is even, the group of 5 is correct.

    # The first person (informant) uses their guess to signal the parity of the
    # other 8 people's hats.
    # The other 8 people (followers) can then use this information, combined
    # with the 7 hats they can see among the other followers, to deduce their own hat color.
    # This guarantees all followers are correct.
