    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph that has 12345 vertices but is not a complete graph. Let's denote the number of vertices by $n = 12345$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understanding Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a graph, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Complete Graph:** A complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted as $K_n$, is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. To color $K_n$, every vertex must have a unique color. Therefore, the chromatic number of a complete graph is equal to its number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n\n3.  **The Constraint:** The problem states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n4.  **Upper Bound for Non-Complete Graphs:** There is a fundamental theorem in graph theory which states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, if $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n-1$.\n    *   **Proof Sketch:** If a graph $G$ is not complete, it means there are at least two vertices, say `u` and `v`, that are not connected by an edge. Because they are not adjacent, we can safely assign them the same color. We can then use a new, distinct color for each of the remaining $n-2$ vertices. This leads to a valid coloring using at most $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. Therefore, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n5.  **Applying the Bound:** For our graph with $n = 12345$ vertices, since it is not a complete graph, the maximum number of colors needed is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n6.  **Achievability of the Maximum:** To confirm that 12344 is the maximum possible value, we must show that there exists at least one graph that satisfies the conditions and requires exactly 12344 colors. Consider the following graph $G$:\n    *   Take a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$.\n    *   Add one more vertex to the graph, but do not connect it to any of the other vertices (i.e., it's an isolated vertex).\n    *   This resulting graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   The chromatic number of this graph is 12344, because the $K_{12344}$ subgraph itself requires 12344 distinct colors.\n\nSince we have established an upper bound of 12344 and found an example that achieves this bound, the maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a non-complete graph with 12345 vertices.\n\n    Let n be the number of vertices in a graph G.\n    A key result in graph theory states that the chromatic number chi(G) is equal to n\n    if and only if G is a complete graph (K_n).\n\n    If G is not a complete graph, then its chromatic number chi(G) is at most n-1.\n    The problem specifies the graph G has n=12345 vertices and is not a complete graph.\n    Thus, the maximum possible chromatic number for G is n-1.\n\n    We need to show this maximum is achievable. A graph consisting of a complete subgraph K_{n-1}\n    and one isolated vertex is not a complete graph, and its chromatic number is n-1.\n    So, the maximum is indeed n-1.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # The maximum number of colors for a non-complete graph with n vertices is n - 1.\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"For a graph G with n vertices that is not a complete graph, the maximum number of colors needed is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"So, the maximum number of colors is {num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
