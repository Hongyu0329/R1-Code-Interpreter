    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the specific self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933 after his encounter with the Gestapo.\n2.  I will then research the iconography and symbolism within that painting.\n3.  Finally, I will identify the object he holds in his hand and its meaning as a symbol of resistance.\n4.  I will present this information in a Python script that prints the answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the question about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \n    The painting in question is \"Self-Portrait with Opened Collar\" (Selbstbildnis mit offenem Kragen).\n    In it, Querner depicts himself after his interrogation and brief imprisonment by the Gestapo.\n    He holds a common, personal object that serves as a symbol of his steadfast, proletarian\n    identity and quiet defiance in the face of oppression.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event = \"escaped from Gestapo\"\n    symbol_object = \"a pipe\"\n\n    print(f\"In his {year} self-portrait, painted after he had {event}, {artist} holds {symbol_object} in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a pipe>>>"
