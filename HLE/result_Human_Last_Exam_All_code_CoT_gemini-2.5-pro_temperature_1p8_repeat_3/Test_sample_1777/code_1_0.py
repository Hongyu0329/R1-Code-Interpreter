# Step 1: Define the given values
E_g = 3.0  # Band gap in eV
E_1s = 1.0 # 1s exciton resonance peak in eV
n = 3      # Target principal quantum number

# Step 2: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton (ground state)
# This is also known as the exciton Rydberg energy.
Eb_1s = E_g - E_1s

print(f"The binding energy of the 1s exciton is the band gap minus the 1s resonance peak energy:")
print(f"E_b(1s) = E_g - E_1s = {E_g} eV - {E_1s} eV = {Eb_1s} eV\n")


# Step 3: Calculate the binding energy for the n=3 state using the 2D exciton model.
# The formula for binding energy in 2D is E_b(n) = R* / (n - 1/2)^2.
# We can find E_b(3) relative to E_b(1).
# E_b(n) = E_b(1s) * ( (1 - 0.5)^2 / (n - 0.5)^2 )
numerator = (1 - 0.5)**2
denominator = (n - 0.5)**2
scaling_factor = numerator / denominator
Eb_3s = Eb_1s * scaling_factor
