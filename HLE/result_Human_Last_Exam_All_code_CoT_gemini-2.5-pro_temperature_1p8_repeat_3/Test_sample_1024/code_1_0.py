# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes allusion
# The most famous story with faked tracks via special footwear is "The Adventure of the Priory School".
# The special shoes (horseshoes that mimic cow prints) were worn by a horse.
answer_A = 7

# Part B: Thematic resonance
# The allusion, concerning reversed/deceptive tracks and identity (horse as cow),
# perfectly underscores the central theme of "reflection and duality" in Pale Fire.
answer_B = 1

# Part C: Nabokov's prior work
# Nabokov's critical study on "Nikolai Gogol" was a profound early exercise
# in creatively and subjectively interpreting another author's work,
# a direct methodological precursor to the poet-commentator dynamic in Pale Fire.
answer_C = 0

# The sum is 7 + 1 + 0 = 8, which is a multiple of 8.
# The final answer is the three numbers separated by spaces.
# The following code prints the final equation as requested.
print(f"{answer_A} + {answer_B} + {answer_C} = {answer_A + answer_B + answer_C}")

# Now, we print the final answer in the required format for the submission.
# Although the prompt asks for "print" functions for output when relevant, 
# for the final answer format of "3 2 3" or "<<<content>>>",
# we must format it specifically for the final response block.
# The problem statement above says "directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response".
# And also asks to output the numbers in the final equation. So I will print the equation and then the numbers.
# However, the user prompt states "Don't include multiple code blocks in one response".
# "Don't ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant."
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# Based on these rules, I will just print the final result.

print(f"{answer_A} {answer_B} {answer_C}")
