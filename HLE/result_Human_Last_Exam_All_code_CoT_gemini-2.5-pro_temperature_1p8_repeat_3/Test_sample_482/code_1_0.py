# Plan:
# 1. Define the inter-event interval given in the problem.
# 2. Calculate the mean rate 'mu' from this interval.
# 3. State the derived critical condition, which is C = sigma^2, where C is the
#    cross-population covariance and sigma^2 is the intra-population variance.
# 4. Apply the common simplification for Poisson processes where the variance of the
#    rate is considered equal to the mean rate (sigma^2 = mu).
# 5. Calculate the numerical value for the critical correlation C and print the result.

# Step 1: Define the inter-event interval.
inter_event_interval = 150  # in seconds

# Step 2: Calculate the mean rate 'mu'.
mu = 1 / inter_event_interval

# Step 3 & 4: The critical correlation C is equal to the input variance sigma^2.
# For a Poisson process, we approximate sigma^2 = mu.
sigma_squared = mu
C_critical = sigma_squared

# Step 5: Print the final equation and the result.
print("The analysis of weight dynamics reveals that selectivity emerges at a critical point.")
print("This critical point occurs when the correlation between input populations, C, is equal to the variance of each population, sigma^2.")
print("\nFinal Equation: C_critical = sigma^2")

print("\nFor a Poisson process, we use the property that variance is equal to the mean rate (sigma^2 = mu).")
print(f"The mean rate mu is 1 / {inter_event_interval}s = {mu:.4f} Hz.")
