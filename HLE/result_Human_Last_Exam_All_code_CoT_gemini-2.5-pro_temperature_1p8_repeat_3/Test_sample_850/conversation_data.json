    "There is a fundamental contradiction in your question. Optical activity is a property that arises from chirality. A crystal class is chiral if it lacks symmetry elements that would make it superimposable on its mirror image (specifically, a center of inversion or a mirror plane). Conversely, a crystal class is achiral if it possesses at least one of these symmetry elements.\n\nTherefore, by definition, an **achiral** crystal class cannot be optically active. The set of crystal classes that are both achiral and optically active is empty.\n\nIt is likely that you intended to ask for the crystal classes that are **chiral** and **non-polar**. These are the classes that are optically active but are not polar (i.e., they are not pyroelectric).\n\nThe following Python script will first demonstrate the contradiction in your original question and then proceed to find the crystal classes that are chiral (optically active) and non-polar.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystallographic point groups to find those matching specific symmetry criteria.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 11 chiral (and thus optically active) crystal classes.\n    # These lack a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n    chiral_classes = {'1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'}\n\n    # The 21 achiral crystal classes are all other classes.\n    # We can define them for completeness.\n    achiral_classes = {\n        '-1', 'm', '2/m',\n        'mmm', 'mm2',\n        '-3', '3m', '-3m',\n        '4/m', '-4', '4mm', '4/mmm', '42m',\n        '6/m', '-6', '6mm', '6/mmm', '6m2',\n        'm-3', '43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # The 10 polar crystal classes.\n    # These have a unique polar axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity.\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', 'm', 'mm2', '3m', '4mm', '6mm'}\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the user's original query: 'achiral', 'non-polar', and 'optically active'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    # A class is optically active if and only if it is chiral.\n    optically_active_classes = chiral_classes\n\n    # The query asks for classes that are in the intersection of 'achiral_classes' and 'optically_active_classes'.\n    contradiction_set = achiral_classes.intersection(optically_active_classes)\n\n    print(f\"A crystal class is optically active if and only if it is chiral.\")\n    print(f\"By definition, a class cannot be both chiral and achiral.\")\n    print(f\"The set of classes that are both 'achiral' and 'optically active' is: {contradiction_set if contradiction_set else 'Empty'}\\n\")\n\n\n    print(\"Assuming the intended query was for 'chiral' (optically active) and 'non-polar' classes:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    # We find the set of chiral classes that are not polar.\n    chiral_non_polar_classes = chiral_classes.difference(polar_classes)\n\n    # Sort the result for clear presentation\n    sorted_result = sorted(list(chiral_non_polar_classes), key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n\n    print(\"The optically active (chiral) and non-polar crystal classes are:\")\n    # Print the final list\n    print(', '.join(sorted_result))\n\n\nsolve_crystal_class_query()\n<<<222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432>>>\n```"
