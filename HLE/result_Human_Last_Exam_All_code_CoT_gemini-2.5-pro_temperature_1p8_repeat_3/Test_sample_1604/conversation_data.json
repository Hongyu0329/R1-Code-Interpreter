    "To determine which battle depicted by Lady Butler occurred latest in history, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  I will compile a list of Lady Butler's famous battle paintings.\n2.  For each painting, I will identify the year the historical battle took place.\n3.  I will store these battles and their corresponding years in a Python dictionary.\n4.  The code will then iterate through the dictionary to find the maximum year.\n5.  Finally, the program will print the name of the battle and its year, displaying the comparison of all considered years to identify the latest one.\n\n```python\ndef find_latest_battle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler from a predefined list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of battles depicted by Lady Butler and the year they occurred.\n    # The dictionary keys are the battle names and the values are the years.\n    battles = {\n        \"Battle of Quatre Bras\": 1815,\n        \"Battle of Waterloo\": 1815,\n        \"Battle of Inkerman (depicted in 'The Roll Call')\": 1854,\n        \"Battle of Rorke's Drift\": 1879,\n        \"Battle of Laing's Nek (depicted in 'Floreat Etona!')\": 1881,\n        \"Battle of Tel El Kebir\": 1882\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the years of battles depicted by Lady Butler:\")\n    # Extracting the years into a list for comparison\n    years = list(battles.values())\n    \n    # Printing each battle and its year\n    for battle, year in battles.items():\n        print(f\"- {battle}: {year}\")\n    \n    # Finding the latest year and the corresponding battle\n    latest_year = max(years)\n    latest_battle = \"\"\n    for battle, year in battles.items():\n        if year == latest_year:\n            latest_battle = battle\n            break # Stop when the first match is found\n\n    # Formatting the numbers for the final equation style output\n    years_str = \"], [\".join(map(str, years))\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo find the latest battle, we find the maximum of the years:\")\n    # The \"equation\" as requested, showing the comparison of all numbers\n    print(f\"max([{years_str}]) = {latest_year}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe latest battle depicted is:\")\n    print(f\"{latest_battle}\")\n\nfind_latest_battle()\n```\n<<<The battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that was the latest historically is the Battle of Tel El Kebir, which occurred in 1882.>>>"
