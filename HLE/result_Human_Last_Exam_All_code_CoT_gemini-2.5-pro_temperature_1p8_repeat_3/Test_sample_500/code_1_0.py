# Plan:
# 1. Define the arrival rate lambda from the problem statement.
# 2. Define the coefficient 'c' of the 1/u term in the service time tail probability.
# 3. Calculate the dimensionless parameter beta = lambda * c, which is hypothesized to be the required answer in this special boundary case.
# 4. Print the final equation and the result.

# Arrival rate
lambda_rate = 3

# Coefficient of the 1/u term in P(S > u)
c = 1/3

# In the boundary case where E[S] is infinite due to a tail like c/u,
# a key system parameter is the product of the arrival rate and this coefficient.
# The question appears to be asking for this value.
liminf_Xt = lambda_rate * c
