    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total welfare, which is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus at the market equilibrium. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Find the Market Equilibrium:** The market is in equilibrium where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_E`) and the price is the same for both (`P_S = P_D = P_E`). We find this point by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    This equation is complex and will be solved numerically to find the equilibrium quantity `Q_E` and equilibrium price `P_E`.\n\n2.  **Define Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS).\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** The area between the demand curve and the equilibrium price line.\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS):** The area between the equilibrium price line and the supply curve.\n    *   **Total Welfare (TW) = CS + PS**, which is equivalent to the total area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n3.  **Determine the Integration Limits:**\n    *   The upper limit for the integration is the equilibrium quantity, `Q_E`.\n    *   The lower limit requires careful consideration. The supply function `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` can produce negative prices. A realistic market operates only at positive prices. The supply price `P` is zero when `ln(Q³ - 2) = 0`, which simplifies to `Q³ - 2 = 1`, or `Q³ = 3`. Therefore, the market effectively starts at `Q = 3^(1/3)`. We will use this as the lower limit for our integration.\n\n4.  **Calculate Surplus using Integration:** We will calculate the definite integrals for CS and PS numerically over the interval from `Q = 3^(1/3)` to `Q_E`.\n    *   `CS = ∫[3^(1/3) to Q_E] (P_Demand(Q) - P_E) dQ`\n    *   `PS = ∫[3^(1/3) to Q_E] (P_E - P_Supply(Q)) dQ`\n\n5.  **Sum for Total Welfare:** Finally, we add the calculated consumer and producer surplus to get the total welfare and present the final equation as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the demand and supply price functions\n    def demand_price(q):\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    def supply_price(q):\n        # The function is defined for Q^3 > 2, but we are interested in P >= 0.\n        # This occurs when Q^3 >= 3.\n        # Handle potential domain errors for values outside the integration range.\n        if isinstance(q, (np.ndarray, list)):\n             # Vectorized operation for quad integrator\n            return np.log(np.maximum(q**3 - 2, 1e-9)) # Use a small epsilon to avoid log(0)\n        else:\n            # Scalar operation for fsolve\n            return np.log(q**3 - 2) if q**3 > 2 else -np.inf\n\n\n    # --- Step 1: Find Market Equilibrium ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Finding Market Equilibrium...\")\n\n    # Define the equation to solve for equilibrium: P_demand(Q) - P_supply(Q) = 0\n    def equilibrium_equation(q):\n        return demand_price(q) - supply_price(q)\n\n    # Solve for the equilibrium quantity Q_E.
