    The simple answer is no. The two systems are fundamentally incompatible. Gödel's
    proof is a formal argument in modal logic, dealing with concepts like 'necessity'
    and 'positive properties'. Quantum mechanics (QM) is a physical theory described
    by mathematics like linear algebra and differential equations, dealing with physical
    observables like energy and position.
