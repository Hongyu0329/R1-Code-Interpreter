    "This is a fascinating philosophical question that intersects with logic, physics, and metaphysics. It's important to understand that Gödel's ontological proof and the mathematics of quantum mechanics operate in entirely different domains.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Explain the Mismatch:** First, I will explain that Gödel's proof is a work of formal, axiomatic logic (specifically, S5 modal logic), while quantum mechanics is a physical theory described by a different set of mathematical tools (linear algebra, differential equations, probability theory). They do not use the same language, axioms, or objects of study.\n2.  **Symbolic Representation:** I will write a Python script to symbolically represent the core components of both systems.\n    *   For Gödel's proof, I'll represent its definitions, axioms, and final theorem as text strings. This will highlight that its \"equations\" are logical propositions.\n    *   For quantum mechanics, I'll represent a key equation like the Time-Dependent Schrödinger equation. This will highlight that its equations describe the evolution of physical systems.\n3.  **Demonstrate Incompatibility:** The script's output will juxtapose these two systems, making it clear that one cannot be used to prove the other. There is no way to translate the concepts of \"positive property\" (P) or \"necessity\" (□) from Gödel's logic into the mathematical objects of quantum mechanics, such as a state vector (|ψ⟩) or a Hamiltonian operator (H).\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The script will conclude by stating that it's not possible to use the mathematics of quantum mechanics to prove Gödel's ontological proof.\n\nHere is the Python script to illustrate this.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_godel_and_qm():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains why quantum mechanics cannot prove Gödel's ontological argument.\n    It does so by symbolically representing the \"equations\" of both systems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"### Task: Can quantum mechanics prove Gödel's ontological proof? ###\\n\")\n    intro_text = \"\"\"\n    The simple answer is no. The two systems are fundamentally incompatible. Gödel's\n    proof is a formal argument in modal logic, dealing with concepts like 'necessity'\n    and 'positive properties'. Quantum mechanics (QM) is a physical theory described\n    by mathematics like linear algebra and differential equations, dealing with physical\n    observables like energy and position.\n\n    Let's represent the core 'equations' of each system to see why they don't overlap.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(intro_text))\n\n    # --- Gödel's Ontological Proof (Symbolic Logic) ---\n    print(\"\\n--- System 1: Gödel's Ontological Proof (Modal Logic) ---\")\n    godel_components = {\n        \"Definition 1\": \"G(x) ↔ ∀φ[P(φ) → φ(x)]  (A being x is God-like if it has all 'positive' properties φ).\",\n        \"Axiom 1\": \"P(φ) ∧ □∀x[φ(x) → ψ(x)] → P(ψ) (If φ is a positive property and φ necessarily entails ψ, then ψ is a positive property).\",\n        \"Axiom 2\": \"P(¬φ) ↔ ¬P(φ) (A property is positive if and only if its negation is not positive).\",\n        \"Theorem\": \"□∃xG(x) (It is necessary that a God-like being exists).\"\n    }\n\n    for name, text in godel_components.items():\n        print(f\"{name}: {text}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nNote: The symbols here are logical (∀ 'for all', □ 'necessarily', → 'implies', P 'is a positive property').\")\n    print(\"This system has no physical constants or numerical equations.\")\n\n    # --- Quantum Mechanics (Mathematical Physics) ---\n    print(\"\\n--- System 2: Quantum Mechanics (Example: Schrödinger Equation) ---\")\n    schrodinger_eq = \"iħ(d/dt)|ψ(t)⟩ = H|ψ(t)⟩\"\n    print(f\"Key Equation: {schrodinger_eq}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe components of this physical equation are:\")\n    print(\"i: The imaginary unit, a complex number (sqrt(-1)).\")\n    print(\"ħ: The reduced Planck constant (a number, approx. 1.054 x 10^-34 J·s).\")\n    print(\"|ψ(t)⟩: The state vector of the system in a Hilbert space.\")\n    print(\"H: The Hamiltonian operator (describes the total energy of the system).\")\n    print(\"(d/dt): A differential operator with respect to time.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n### Final Equation Analysis ###\")\n    print(\"\\nGödel's Final 'Equation' (Logical Theorem):\")\n    # This addresses the user request to output the final equation.\n    # It is a symbolic representation as there are no numbers.\n    final_godel_equation = \"□ ∃x ∀φ [P(φ) → φ(x)]\"\n    print(f\"1 * ({final_godel_equation})\")\n    print(\"Here, we see logical symbols.
