    "The task is to determine the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas, which follows Bose-Einstein statistics. This can be achieved using the principles of statistical mechanics, which are the physical manifestation of large deviation theory concepts like the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Conceptual Framework:** I will start from the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics for a Bose gas. The equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the macrostate with the highest number of microstates, which means maximizing the system's entropy. This principle of maximum entropy is the physical counterpart to the ideas in large deviation theory about finding the most probable state.\n2.  **Derivation of Equilibrium Distribution:** I will maximize the Bose-Einstein entropy functional `S[{n_i}]` subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy `<E> = Σ n_i ε_i`. For photons, the number of particles is not conserved, which sets the chemical potential to zero. This procedure yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the mean occupation number `<n_i>` of an energy state `ε_i`.\n3.  **Formulas for Energy and Entropy:** Using the derived distribution and the density of states for photons in a 3D volume, I will integrate over all energy levels to find the total mean energy `<E>` (leading to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy density) and the total entropy `S`.\n4.  **Python Implementation:** I will provide a Python script that:\n    *   States the derived formulas for mean energy `<E>` and entropy `S`.\n    *   Defines the necessary physical constants.\n    *   Calculates numerical values for `<E>` and `S` for a sample system (e.g., a 1 m³ volume at 300 K).\n    *   Prints the final formulas with the numerical values substituted in, as requested.\n\nThe equilibrium state is described by the mean energy `<E>` and entropy `S` as functions of temperature `T` and volume `V`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium mean energy and entropy of a photon gas.\n    \n    This script applies the results from statistical mechanics for a gas of bosons\n    (photons) where the number of particles is not conserved. The underlying principles,\n    such as maximizing entropy for a given mean energy, are physical applications of\n    large deviation theorems.\n    \n    The script first presents the derived symbolic formulas and then calculates\n    numerical values for an example case.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
