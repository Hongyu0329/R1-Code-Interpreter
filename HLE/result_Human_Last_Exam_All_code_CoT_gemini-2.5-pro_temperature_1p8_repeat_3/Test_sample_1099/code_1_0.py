    # The problem is to find the minimal cost to simulate a singlet state using
    # classical communication (C) and non-signaling PR-Boxes (N).

    # Step 1: Define the relationship between the resources.
    # The total non-local resource cost (R) can be expressed as a sum of
    # communication (C) and PR-Boxes (N), as 1 bit of communication
    # can simulate 1 PR-Box. The trade-off relationship is linear.
    # Equation form: (coeff_C * C) + (coeff_N * N) = R_total
    coeff_C = 1.0
    coeff_N = 1.0

    # Step 2: Determine the value of the total resource cost (R_total).
    # Landmark results in quantum information theory have established this value.
    # - Toner & Bacon (2003) showed that C=1, N=0 is sufficient.
    # - Pironio (2003) showed that C=1 is necessary when N=0.
    # This fixes the total minimal resource cost to 1.
    R_total = 1.0

    # Step 3: Print the breakdown of the final trade-off equation.
    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # The final equation is: 1.0 * C + 1.0 * N = 1.0
