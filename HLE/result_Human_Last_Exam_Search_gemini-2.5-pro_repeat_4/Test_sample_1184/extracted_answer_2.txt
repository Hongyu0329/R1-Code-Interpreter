Based on the analysis of scientific literature, the specific residues and domains within the human beta-1 subunit that are critical for its interaction with the alpha-1 subunit and for modulating gating properties have been identified.

**1. Hotspots for Interaction with the Alpha-1 (α1) Subunit:**

The primary interaction site on the beta-1 subunit is the **Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain**. Specifically, a hydrophobic groove within this GK domain serves as the high-affinity binding pocket for the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) located on the α1 subunit.

While a region known as the **Beta Interaction Domain (BID)** is crucial, its role is primarily structural. The BID, with a consensus sequence of **E–PYDVVPSMRP–LVGPSLKGYEVTDMMKQALFDF**, ensures the proper folding and integrity of the β-subunit core, which is necessary for the high-affinity interaction, but it does not directly contact the α1 subunit's AID.

**2. Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties of the Alpha-1 (α1) Subunit:**

Gating modulation is not governed by a single site but by the interplay of several domains and specific modifiable residues:

*   **The Guanylate Kinase (GK) Domain:** This domain, in addition to its binding role, is sufficient to modulate the channel's gating properties on its own.

*   **The Intramolecular SH3-GK Interaction:** A crucial regulatory hotspot is the interaction *between* the Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain and the GK domain within the beta-1 subunit itself. This SH3-GK module functions codependently to regulate channel properties like inactivation. Disrupting this internal interaction alters gating modulation.

*   **The HOOK Region:** This is the region that links the SH3 and GK domains. **Serine and Threonine residues** within the HOOK region are hotspots for regulation via phosphorylation, which serves to fine-tune the gating properties of the α1 subunit.
