**(a) Diversity Order:**
*   $\mathbf{S}_a$: Diversity order is 1.
*   $\mathbf{S}_b$: Diversity order is 1.
*   $\mathbf{S}_c$: Diversity order is 2.

**(b) Maximum Directivity:**
Code **$\mathbf{S}_c$** provides the best performance. It achieves full diversity (order 2) and is an orthogonal design, which is superior to codes $\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\mathbf{S}_b$ that only offer a diversity order of 1.
