    "The user is asking a question about graph theory. I need to determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\nHere's my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Prompt:**\n    *   \"Consider all graphs on exactly n = 128 vertices.\" This sets the universe of objects I'm working with.\n    *   \"Determine the maximum possible number...\" I'm looking for a maximum value.\n    *   \"...of different clique sizes...\" This is the quantity to be counted. A \"clique size\" is an integer `k` for which a clique of that size exists.\n    *   \"...that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single such graph.\" This means I need to find *one* graph on 128 vertices, count the number of different clique sizes it contains, and find the graph that makes this count the largest possible.\n\n2.  **Define the Terms:**\n    *   **Graph:** A set of vertices and edges. G = (V, E) with |V| = 128.\n    *   **Clique:** A subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices S ⊆ V, the induced subgraph G[S] consists of the vertices S and *all* the edges from the original graph G that connect vertices in S.\n    *   **An induced subgraph that is a clique:** This is the standard definition of a clique. A subset of vertices S is a clique if and only if the induced subgraph G[S] is a complete graph (K_|S|).\n    *   **Set of clique sizes:** For a given graph G, this is the set C(G) = {k | there exists a clique in G of size k}.\n    *   **The goal:** Find max |C(G)| over all graphs G with |V(G)| = 128.\n\n3.  **Core Logical Argument:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the set of clique sizes, C(G).\n    *   Suppose a graph G has a clique of size `k_max`. Let's call this clique `S_max`. So, `S_max` is a set of `k_max` vertices, and every pair of vertices in `S_max` is connected by an edge.\n    *   Now, consider any integer `k` such that `1 <= k < k_max`. Can we find a clique of size `k` in G?\n    *   Yes. We can simply take any subset of `S_max` that has `k` vertices. Let's call this subset `S_k`. Since all vertices in the larger set `S_max` are connected to each other, all vertices in the subset `S_k` must also be connected to each other.\n    *   Therefore, `S_k` is a clique of size `k`.\n    *   This means that if `k_max` is a possible clique size in G, then every integer from 1 to `k_max` is also a possible clique size.\n    *   This implies that the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph G is always of the form {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}, where ω(G) is the *clique number* of G (the size of the largest clique in G).\n\n4.  **Connecting the Logic to the Question:**\n    *   The number of *different* clique sizes is the size of the set C(G).\n    *   Since C(G) = {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}, the number of different clique sizes is simply ω(G).\n    *   The question is now transformed: \"What is the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for a graph G with 128 vertices?\"\n\n5.  **Solving the Transformed Question:**\n    *   The clique number of a graph on `n` vertices can be at most `n`. This is because a clique is a subset of the vertices, so its size cannot exceed the total number of vertices.\n    *   Can we achieve a clique number of `n`? Yes, with the *complete graph* K_n.\n    *   The complete graph on `n` vertices, K_n, is the graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n    *   In K_n, the set of all `n` vertices forms a clique of size `n`. Therefore, ω(K_n) = n.\n    *   For our specific problem, n = 128.\n    *   The complete graph K_128 has 128 vertices. Its clique number is 128.\n    *   In K_128, any subset of `k` vertices forms a clique of size `k`. This is true for all `k` from 1 to 128.\n    *   Therefore, for the graph G = K_128, the set of clique sizes is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\n    *   The number of different clique sizes in K_128 is 128.\n    *   Since no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, this is the maximum possible value.\n\n6.  **Final Check and Sanity Check:**\n    *   The logic is sound. The property that a subset of a clique is also a clique is fundamental. This ensures the set of clique sizes is not \"sparse\" (e.g., you can't have a K_5 without also having a K_4).\n    *   The search results confirm the definitions of clique, clique number, and induced subgraphs. Some results discuss the number of *maximal* cliques, which is a different and more complex question. The current question is about the sizes of cliques, not just maximal ones. The term \"induced subgraphs\" that are cliques is just the standard way to formally define a clique in a graph. The problem boils down to finding the maximum clique number for a graph on 128 vertices. Turan's theorem deals with the maximum number of edges in a graph that *avoids* a clique of a certain size, which is related but not directly the question asked. The most direct information is basic definitions of clique number, which confirm that ω(G) <= n and that ω(K_n) = n.\n    *   The reasoning holds up. The answer is 128.\n\n## Determining the Maximum Number of Clique Sizes\n\nTo determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph on 128 vertices, we must first understand the relationship between cliques of different sizes within a single graph.\n\n### Understanding Cliques and Induced Subgraphs\n\nA **clique** in a graph is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). An induced subgraph on a set of vertices includes those vertices and all the edges that connect them in the original graph. A set of vertices forms a clique if and only if its induced subgraph is a complete graph (a graph where all vertices are connected to all other vertices).\n\nLet's denote the set of all possible clique sizes in a given graph G as `C(G)`. The question asks for the maximum possible value of `|C(G)|` for any graph G with 128 vertices.\n\n### The Structure of Clique Sizes\n\nA key property of cliques is that any subset of vertices within a clique also forms a clique. For instance, if a graph contains a clique of size 5 (a complete subgraph with 5 vertices), any subset of 4 of those vertices will also be fully connected, thus forming a clique of size 4. This logic extends downwards for all smaller sizes.\n\nThis leads to a crucial conclusion: if a graph `G` has a clique of size `k`, it must also have cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k`. Therefore, the set of clique sizes `C(G)` for any graph `G` is always a continuous set of integers starting from 1, i.e., `C(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`, where `ω(G)` is the **clique number** of the graph—the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n\n### Maximizing the Number of Clique Sizes\n\nSince the number of different clique sizes in a graph `G` is equal to its clique number `ω(G)`, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\nFor any graph with `n` vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed `n`. Thus, the clique number `ω(G)` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n\nTo achieve the maximum possible clique number, we can consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted as `K_128`. In this graph, all 128 vertices are connected to every other vertex.\n\n1.  The entire set of 128 vertices in `K_128` forms a clique of size 128. Therefore, the clique number of `K_128` is 128.\n2.  Based on our earlier reasoning, since `K_128` has a clique of size 128, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n3.  The set of different clique sizes for `K_128` is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\n4.  The number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nAs no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, this is the maximum possible value.\n\n<<<128>>>"
