    "It is not possible to provide a specific number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo scene of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized term for a specific, countable ballet step.\n\nThe term you may be thinking of could be a reference to the style of George Balanchine, a renowned choreographer whose work heavily influenced William Forsythe. The Balanchine technique is known for its distinctive characteristics, such as extreme speed, deep pli√©, and unconventional, asymmetrical arm and hand placements. Forsythe's choreography in \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" is a deconstruction and evolution of classical ballet, and is noted for its athletic leg extensions, off-center lifts, and fast-paced, dynamic movements that pull away from the vertical axis of classical ballet.\n\nSvetlana Gileva, as a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett, performed the role of the \"Jete Woman\" in \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" during the 2014/2015 season. Reviews and photographs from 2015 confirm her performance in this role. The choreography for the entire piece, including the Jete Woman solo, is imbued with the demanding, neoclassical style that is a hallmark of Forsythe's work, which is itself an extension of the Balanchine aesthetic. Therefore, while Gileva's entire performance would have been in a style heavily influenced by Balanchine, it is not possible to quantify it in terms of a specific number of \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a numerical answer as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a defined, countable ballet step.>>>"
