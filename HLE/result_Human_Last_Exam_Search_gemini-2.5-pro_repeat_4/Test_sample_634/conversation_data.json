    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm by performing elementary row operations on the matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2. Let M be this stacked matrix:\nM = [P1; P2] = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nThe procedure involves reducing this matrix to the form [R; 0] where R is a GCRD.\n\n1.  Let the rows be R1, R2, R3, R4. To simplify the process, we can swap the blocks to have the matrix with the lower polynomial degree on top.\n    M' = [P2; P1] = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1], [s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n\n2.  Now, we perform row operations to eliminate the first column entries of the bottom block using the top block. Let the rows of M' be r1, r2, r3, r4.\n    *   Replace r3 with r3 - (s+1) * r1:\n        [s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1) * [s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s]\n    *   Replace r4 with r4 + s * r1:\n        [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s * [s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1], [0, -s], [-1, s^2]]\n\n3.  Let's reorder the rows to group the new simpler rows at the bottom.\n    [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1], [-1, s^2], [0, -s]]\n\n4.  Now, use the new rows to further simplify the matrix. Let the current rows be r1', r2', r3', r4'.\n    *   Replace r1' with r1' + s * r3':\n        [s, 0] + s * [-1, s^2] = [s - s, s^3] = [0, s^3]\n    *   Replace r2' with r2' - (s+1) * r3':\n        [-s - 1, 1] - (s+1) * [-1, s^2] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 - s^2(s+1)] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    [[0, s^3], [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2], [-1, s^2], [0, -s]]\n\n5.  At this stage, we can see that the first column is mostly eliminated. The problem reduces to simplifying the rows that have a non-zero entry only in the second column: [0, s^3], [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2], and [0, -s]. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the polynomials s^3, 1 - s^3 - s^2, and -s.\n    *   GCD(s^3, -s) = s.\n    *   GCD(s, 1 - s^3 - s^2). Using the property GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, b + q*a), we have:\n        GCD(s, 1 - s^3 - s^2) = GCD(s, 1 - s^3 - s^2 + (s^2+s)*s) = GCD(s, 1 - s^3 - s^2 + s^3 + s^2) = GCD(s, 1) = 1.\n    Since the GCD of these polynomials is 1, we can find a combination of row operations that results in a row.\n\n6.  Let's explicitly find this row. We currently have the rows (among others):\n    r_a = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2] + [0, s^3] = [0, 1 - s^2]\n    r_b = [0, -s]\n    Now, perform the operation r_a - s * r_b:\n    [0, 1 - s^2] - s * [0, -s] = [0, 1 - s^2 + s^2] =.\n\n7.  So, we have obtained the row. Let's use this to eliminate other rows.\n    The matrix of non-zero rows is equivalent to:\n    [, [-1, s^2]]\n    *   Replace [-1, s^2] with [-1, s^2] - s^2 *:\n        [-1, s^2] - [0, s^2] = [-1, 0]\n\n8.  The final non-zero rows are and [-1, 0]. We can form the GCRD matrix from these rows.\n    R = [[-1, 0],]\n    By multiplying the first row by -1 (which is a unimodular operation), we get:\n    R' = [,]\n\nThe resulting GCRD is the identity matrix, I. A GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix. Since the identity matrix is unimodular (determinant is 1), and any unimodular matrix multiplied by the GCRD is also a GCRD, we can conclude that the simplest form of the GCRD is the identity matrix.\n\nWhen the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is a unimodular matrix (like the identity matrix), the matrices are said to be right-coprime.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Is I a right divisor of P1? P1 = Q * I implies Q = P1, which is a polynomial matrix. Yes.\n*   Is I a right divisor of P2? P2 = Q * I implies Q = P2, which is a polynomial matrix. Yes.\n*   If D is any other common right divisor, the Bezout identity (which can be constructed from the steps of the Euclidean algorithm) shows that I = X*P1 + Y*P2 for some polynomial matrices X and Y. Therefore, D must also be a right divisor of I. This confirms I is the greatest common right divisor.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
