    "An analysis of the chess position reveals a decisive course of action for White.\n\nThe board configuration is represented by the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`. It is currently White's turn to move.\n\nThe most critical feature of the position is the advanced white pawn on d6, which poses a significant threat to Black. Black's queen on c5 is the primary piece preventing this pawn from advancing and promoting.\n\nBy playing the move `Qxc5+`, White forces an exchange of queens. Black is compelled to recapture the white queen. This leads to two possible scenarios:\n\n*   If Black plays `...bxc5`, the d6-pawn's path to promotion becomes unobstructed, guaranteeing a win for White.\n*   If Black plays `...Kxc5`, a pawn endgame ensues. In this endgame, White's passed d-pawn, supported by the white king, will inevitably advance and promote, securing victory for White.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move for White is to capture the black queen.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
