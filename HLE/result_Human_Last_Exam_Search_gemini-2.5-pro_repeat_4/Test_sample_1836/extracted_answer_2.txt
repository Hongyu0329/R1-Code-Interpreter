The order type of $Y$ is $\kappa$. The question asks for the number of ordinals $\alpha$ such that the order type of $Y$ is at least $\alpha$. This is the number of ordinals $\alpha$ satisfying $\alpha \le \kappa$. The set of these ordinals is $\kappa+1 = \{0, 1, \dots, \beta, \dots\}_{\beta<\kappa} \cup \{\kappa\}$. The cardinality of this set is $|\kappa+1| = \kappa$. Therefore, there are $\kappa$ such ordinals.
