    "<<<With the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge, and constrained to only the epistemic states of \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" two significant problems arise that are independent of Gettier-style cases. These problems challenge the coherence of the \"justification\" condition itself.\n\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress (Agrippan Trilemma):** The JTB model requires that for a belief to be elevated to knowledge, it must be justified. However, the justification itself must rely on other beliefs, which in turn must also be justified. This creates a logical dilemma with three unappealing outcomes:\n    *   **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justification continues endlessly, making it impossible for a finite mind to ever complete the process and thus, to ever truly know something.\n    *   **Circular Reasoning:** The chain of justification eventually loops back on itself, which is a fallacious way to prove a claim.\n    *   **Dogmatic Assumption:** The chain halts at a \"basic belief\" that is accepted without any further justification. This contradicts the core requirement of the JTB model that knowledge must be justified.\n\n    This trilemma suggests that achieving a final, secure justification is impossible, which means the transition from the state of \"Belief\" to \"Knowledge\" can never be definitively completed.\n\n2.  **The Threshold Problem:** The JTB theory does not specify *how much* or *what quality* of justification is sufficient to turn a true belief into knowledge. Given that the only available states are \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge,\" there must be a clear, non-arbitrary line that, when crossed, changes the state. The JTB framework fails to provide this.\n    *   If the standard for justification is too low, it would incorrectly classify beliefs that are true by luck but have flimsy support as \"Knowledge.\"\n    *   If the standard is set too high (e.g., requiring absolute certainty), it would lead to skepticism, as very few of our beliefs could ever meet this standard.\n\n    This lack of a clear threshold makes the distinction between \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge\" ambiguous and arbitrary, which is a fundamental flaw in a theory that purports to define knowledge."
