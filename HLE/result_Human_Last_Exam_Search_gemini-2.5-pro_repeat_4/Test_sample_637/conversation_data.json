    "To design an observer for the discrete-time system\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nsuch that the observation error converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps, we need to design a deadbeat observer. The dynamics of the observer are given by:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C x̂(k))\n\nThe observation error is e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k), and its dynamics are governed by:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor a deadbeat response, the error must vanish in a finite number of steps. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the error dynamics matrix (A - LC) at the origin (z=0). The characteristic polynomial of (A - LC) must be p(z) = zⁿ, where n is the dimension of the state vector x. In this case, n=4, so we require det(zI - (A - LC)) = z⁴.\n\nFirst, we verify the observability of the system. The observability matrix is given by O = [Cᵀ (CA)ᵀ (CA²)ᵀ ... ]ᵀ. The observability index ν is the smallest integer such that the rank of O_ν = [Cᵀ (CA)ᵀ ... (CA^(ν-1))ᵀ]ᵀ is n. A brief calculation shows that the observability matrix has full rank (n=4), so the system is observable and an observer can be designed to place the poles at any desired location. The observability index ν is 3, which is the minimum number of steps for the error to become zero. Setting the characteristic polynomial to z⁴ ensures that (A-LC)⁴ = 0, which also implies (A-LC)³ = 0 since the observability index is 3.\n\nThe matrices are:\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\nC = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\nThe observer gain matrix L is a 4x2 matrix. Let L = [[l₁₁ l₁₂], [l₂₁ l₂₂], [l₃₁ l₃₂], [l₄₁ l₄₂]]ᵀ.\n\nThe error dynamics matrix is A_e = A - LC:\nLC = [[l₁₁+l₁₂ l₁₂], [l₂₁+l₂₂ l₂₂], [l₃₁+l₃₂ l₃₂], [l₄₁+l₄₂ l₄₂]] * [[1 0 0 0],[1 0 0 1]] is incorrect.\nLC = [[l₁₁ l₁₂], [l₂₁ l₂₂], [l₃₁ l₃₂], [l₄₁ l₄₂]] * [[1 0 0 0],[1 0 0 1]] = [[l₁₁+l₁₂ 0 0 l₁₂], [l₂₁+l₂₂ 0 0 l₂₂], [l₃₁+l₃₂ 0 0 l₃₂], [l₄₁+l₄₂ 0 0 l₄₂]]\n\nA_e = A - LC =\n[[-1-l₁₁-l₁₂  0  0  1-l₁₂],\n [1-l₂₁-l₂₂   0  0  2-l₂₂],\n [-l₃₁-l₃₂    1  0 -1-l₃₂],\n [-1-l₄₁-l₄₂   0  1 -1-l₄₂]]\n\nWe need to find the characteristic polynomial det(zI - A_e) and set its coefficients to zero.\nLet sᵢ = lᵢ₁ + lᵢ₂.\ndet(zI - A_e) = det([[z+1+s₁  0  0  -1+l₁₂],\n                      [-1+s₂   z  0  -2+l₂₂],\n                      [s₃      -1  z   1+l₃₂],\n                      [1+s₄    0 -1  z+1+l₄₂]])\n\nExpanding the determinant yields the characteristic polynomial:\nP(z) = z⁴ + (s₁+l₄₂+2)z³ + (1+l₃₂+(1+s₁)(1+l₄₂))z² + ((1+s₁)(1+l₃₂)-s₃(l₁₂-1)+l₂₂-2)z + ((1+s₁)(l₂₂-2)-(s₂-1)(l₁₂-1))\n\nFor P(z) = z⁴, the coefficients of z³, z², z¹, and the constant term must be zero. This gives a system of four equations for the eight unknown elements of L:\n1.  s₁ + l₄₂ + 2 = 0\n2.  1 + l₃₂ + (1+s₁)(1+l₄₂) = 0\n3.  (1+s₁)(1+l₃₂) - s₃(l₁₂-1) + l₂₂ - 2 = 0\n4.  (1+s₁)(l₂₂-2) - (s₂-1)(l₁₂-1) = 0\n\nSince we have more unknowns than equations, there are multiple solutions for L. We can simplify the problem by making judicious choices for some of the variables. Let's set l₁₂=1 and l₂₂=2.\nThe equations become:\n1.  l₁₁+1+l₄₂ + 2 = 0  =>  l₁₁+l₄₂ = -3\n2.  1 + l₃₂ + (1+l₁₁+1)(1+l₄₂) = 0  =>  1 + l₃₂ + (l₁₁+2)(1+l₄₂) = 0\n3.  (1+l₁₁+1)(1+l₃₂) - s₃(1-1) + 2 - 2 = 0  =>  (l₁₁+2)(1+l₃₂) = 0\n4.  (1+l₁₁+1)(2-2) - (s₂-1)(1-1) = 0  =>  0 = 0\n\nFrom equation (3), we have two possibilities: l₁₁ = -2 or l₃₂ = -1.\nLet's choose l₁₁ = -2.\nSubstituting into (1): -2 + l₄₂ = -3  =>  l₄₂ = -1.\nSubstituting l₁₁ = -2 into (2): 1 + l₃₂ + (-2+2)(1-1) = 0  =>  1 + l₃₂ = 0  =>  l₃₂ = -1.\nThis is consistent with the second possibility from equation (3).\n\nSo far we have:\nl₁₁ = -2, l₁₂ = 1\nl₂₂ = 2\nl₃₂ = -1\nl₄₂ = -1\n\nThe remaining variables are l₂₁, l₃₁, l₄₁, which are not constrained by the equations. We can set them to zero for simplicity:\nl₂₁ = 0\nl₃₁ = 0\nl₄₁ = 0\n\nThis gives a valid gain matrix L.\n\nThe resulting observer gain matrix is:\nL = [[-2, 1],\n     [ 0, 2],\n     [ 0,-1],\n     [ 0,-1]]\n\n<<<\n[[-2, 1],\n [ 0, 2],\n [ 0,-1],\n [ 0,-1]]\n>>>"
