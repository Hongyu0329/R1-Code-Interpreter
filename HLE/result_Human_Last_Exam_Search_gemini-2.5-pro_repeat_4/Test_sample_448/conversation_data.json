    "Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\nThe noble gases are a group of chemical elements that includes helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). While xenon is the rarest of the stable noble gases, with an atmospheric concentration of about 0.0000087%, radon is significantly rarer.\n\nRadon is a radioactive gas, and its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of radium, which is found in soil and rocks. However, due to its rapid decay, radon's concentration in the Earth's atmosphere is extremely low, estimated to be around 6 x 10⁻¹⁷%.\n\nThe question specifies the percentage of all terrestrial matter, which includes the atmosphere, crust, and oceans. Although radon is generated within the Earth's crust, its short half-life prevents it from accumulating in any significant quantity, making it one of the rarest elements on Earth. The scientific understanding of noble gas abundances was well-established by 2002, as evidenced by numerous references to scientific literature from that period.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
