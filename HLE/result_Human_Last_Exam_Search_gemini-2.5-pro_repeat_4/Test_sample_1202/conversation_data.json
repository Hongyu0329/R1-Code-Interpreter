    "Following a gene duplication event, the two resulting gene copies face several potential evolutionary fates. Understanding these fates is key to identifying the mechanism most likely responsible for both the retention and divergence of these genes.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization (Nonfunctionalization):** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. One copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional, turning it into a pseudogene. This outcome represents a loss of genetic material, not the retention of two distinct, functional genes.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. Both genes are then preserved by natural selection. However, this process relies on the rare occurrence of a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation before the redundant copy is silenced by more common degenerative mutations.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization:** This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or patterns of expression (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy sustains degenerative mutations that silence different, complementary subfunctions. As a result, both gene copies become necessary to perform the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally carried out. This partitioning of labor ensures both copies are retained.\n\n*   **Gene Conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between similar sequences, such as duplicated genes. It tends to homogenize the two copies, making them more alike. While it can create novel chimeric alleles, its primary effect is to work against the divergence needed to preserve both copies for different functions.\n\n*   **Adaptive Radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary process where a lineage rapidly diversifies into new species. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not a direct molecular mechanism for the retention of an individual gene pair within a genome.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, the latter is considered a more likely mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes. Subfunctionalization relies on common, selectively neutral, or nearly neutral degenerative mutations to partition ancestral functions. This provides a passive route for preserving both copies, protecting them from being lost through pseudogenization and allowing time for further evolutionary divergence. Neofunctionalization, while important, is considered less probable for initial retention because it requires a rare, beneficial gain-of-function mutation to occur in a short window of time. Therefore, subfunctionalization offers a more parsimonious explanation for the widespread retention of duplicate genes seen in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
