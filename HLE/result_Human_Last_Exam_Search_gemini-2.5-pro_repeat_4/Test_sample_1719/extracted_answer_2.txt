The homotopy-theoretic obstructions for two paths of bundle automorphisms, $\phi_t$ and $\psi_t$, to be homotopic through paths of bundle automorphisms fixing the endpoints are the elements of the first homotopy group of the space of bundle automorphisms, $\pi_1(\text{Aut}(E))$.

First, a vector bundle $E$ over a suspension space $\Sigma X$ is "turnable" if and only if it is trivial. This is a known result in K-theory; for a bundle over a suspension, being turnable implies all its characteristic classes vanish, which for a base space like $\Sigma X$, ensures the bundle is trivial. Therefore, the space of automorphisms of $E$, denoted $\text{Aut}(E)$, is homotopy equivalent to the mapping space $\text{Map}(\Sigma X, SO(2k))$.

The problem then reduces to identifying the group $\pi_1(\text{Map}(\Sigma X, SO(2k)))$. For a suspension space as the domain, this mapping space decomposes. Specifically, the evaluation fibration $\text{Map}_*(\Sigma X, SO(2k)) \to \text{Map}(\Sigma X, SO(2k)) \to SO(2k)$ has a section, which implies that the homotopy groups of the total space are direct products of the homotopy groups of the base and the fiber.
Thus, we have the isomorphism:
$\pi_1(\text{Map}(\Sigma X, SO(2k))) \cong \pi_1(SO(2k)) \times \pi_1(\text{Map}_*(\Sigma X, SO(2k)))$

The second term can be further analyzed using the loop-suspension adjunction.
$\pi_1(\text{Map}_*(\Sigma X, SO(2k))) = [S^1, \text{Map}_*(\Sigma X, SO(2k))]_* \cong [S^1 \wedge \Sigma X, SO(2k)]_* = [\Sigma^2 X, SO(2k)]_*$
This group can be expressed using obstruction theory. The obstructions to constructing a map from a CW-complex (like $\Sigma^2 X$) to a space (like $SO(2k)$) lie in the cohomology groups of the domain with coefficients in the homotopy groups of the target space. The relevant groups are of the form $H^m(\Sigma^2 X; \pi_m(SO(2k)))$.

Using the suspension isomorphism for cohomology, $H^m(\Sigma^2 X; G) \cong \tilde{H}^{m-2}(X; G)$, where $\tilde{H}$ denotes reduced cohomology. Since $X$ is a homology $(n-1)$-sphere, its reduced cohomology with any coefficient group $G$ is non-zero only in degree $n-1$. This means the only non-vanishing obstruction group occurs when $m-2 = n-1$, which implies $m = n+1$.

The resulting obstruction group is $\tilde{H}^{n-1}(X; \pi_{n+1}(SO(2k)))$. By the Universal Coefficient Theorem, and since $H_{n-1}(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $H_{n-2}(X) = 0$ (for $n>1$), this cohomology group is isomorphic to $\pi_{n+1}(SO(2k))$.

Therefore, the group of obstructions decomposes into two main parts, which are determined by the following list of groups:
*   $H_{n-1}(X)$ and $\pi_{n+1}(SO(2k))$: These determine the spatially dependent part of the obstruction, corresponding to the group $[\Sigma^2 X, SO(2k)]$. The fact that $X$ is a homology $(n-1)$-sphere implies $H_{n-1}(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, which leads to the obstruction component $\pi_{n+1}(SO(2k))$.
*   $\pi_1(SO(2k))$: This is the spatially independent, or "point-wise," part of the obstruction, which exists even if the space $X$ were a point. This component comes directly from the homotopy of the structure group itself.
