    "To determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we must first identify the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, we seek to factor the polynomial $f(x)$. By testing for simple roots, we find that $f(\\sqrt{2}) = 0$. This implies that $(x^2-2)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. Performing polynomial division, we obtain the factorization:\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n*   The polynomial $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group of $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$.\n*   The polynomial $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The derivative is $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, which has two real roots, leading to two local extrema for $h(x)$. Evaluating $h(x)$ at these critical points reveals one positive maximum and one negative minimum. This, combined with the limits as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, shows that $h(x)$ has exactly three real roots and thus two complex conjugate roots. For an irreducible quintic polynomial, having exactly three real roots implies that its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the symmetric group $S_5$. Let $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$. Then $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the fields $K_g$ and $K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe field $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension. The only quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$. The discriminant of $x^n + ax + b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$. For $h(x)$, with $n=5, a=-9, b=3$, the discriminant is a large negative integer. Since $D < 0$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field, while $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Therefore, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThus, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product:\n$G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = |C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H]$, where $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is the corresponding normal subgroup. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means we are looking for the indices of all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, the alternating group $A_5$, and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$. The normal subgroups of the direct product $C_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n1.  **Product subgroups:**\n    *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1|=2$. The index is $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H_2|=60$. The index is $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H_3|=120$. The index is $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H_4|=120$. The index is $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Other normal subgroups:** There exists one other normal subgroup. Let $\\phi: C_2 \\to C_2$ be the identity map and $\\psi: S_5 \\to S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$ be the sign homomorphism. The subgroup $H_5 = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(c) \\neq \\psi(\\sigma)\\}$ is a normal subgroup. This can be described as $H_5 = (\\{e\\} \\times A_5) \\cup \\{(c, \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\notin A_5\\}$, where $c$ is the non-identity element of $C_2$. The order of this subgroup is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$. The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of all possible indices for proper, non-trivial normal subgroups is $\\{120, 4, 2\\}$. These are the possible degrees for the field extensions $L$.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
