    "Hypothetically, a perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms. This is based on the chemical structure of a known flexible nanocar, which has the formula C310H34.\n\nThe term \"nanocar\" refers to a single molecule designed to resemble a car, with a chassis and wheels. The original nanocar has an H-shaped chassis and four fullerene (C60) wheels. The hydrogen atoms are part of the chassis structure.\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in the original molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms. In the case of the nanocar with the chemical formula C310H34, there are 34 hydrogen atoms that can be substituted. The fullerene wheels are composed entirely of carbon and do not have any hydrogen atoms to be replaced.\n\nTherefore, by replacing each of the 34 hydrogen atoms with a fluorine atom, the resulting perfluoronanocar would have 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
