    "In quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum operator, **J**, is the sum of the orbital angular momentum operator, **L**, and the spin angular momentum operator, **S**. For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, is 1, and the spin quantum number, *s*, is 1/2.\n\nThe operators J² and Jz commute with each other, which means they have a common set of eigenstates. These are denoted by |j, m<sub>j</sub>⟩, where *j* is the total angular momentum quantum number and *m<sub>j</sub>* is the projection of the total angular momentum on the z-axis.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are obtained by the vector addition of the orbital and spin angular momenta, ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps. For a p-electron (*l* = 1, *s* = 1/2), the possible values of *j* are:\n*   *j* = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n*   *j* = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nThe eigenvalues of the J² operator are given by ħ²*j*(*j* + 1), and the eigenvalues of the Jz operator are given by ħ*m<sub>j</sub>*, where *m<sub>j</sub>* can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nBased on these principles, we can determine the common eigenvalues for a p-electron:\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of J² is ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ**.\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of J² is ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -1/2 and 1/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are **(-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ**.\n\nTherefore, the common eigenvalues are:\n\n*   For J²: **(15/4)ħ²** and **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   For Jz: **(3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (-3/2)ħ** (associated with j=3/2) and **(1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ** (associated with j=1/2).\n\nIt is important to note that for each eigenvalue of J², there is a set of corresponding eigenvalues for Jz.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are 3/2 and 1/2.\n\nFor *j* = 3/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ². The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.\n\nFor *j* = 1/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ². The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.>>>"
