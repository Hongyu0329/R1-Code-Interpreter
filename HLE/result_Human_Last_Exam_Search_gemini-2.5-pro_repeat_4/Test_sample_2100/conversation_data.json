    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the poet Nikolai Gumilyov. Gumilyov was arrested and executed in 1921 on fabricated charges of counter-revolutionary activities. For decades, the exact location of his burial was unknown. It was not until the late 1980s, during the period of Glasnost in the Soviet Union, that the truth about many such cases began to be revealed and burial sites were discovered. Gumilyov's case was officially dismissed in 1991 for lack of evidence.\n\nThe description \"sailor\" is a metaphor for Gumilyov's adventurous spirit and his extensive travels, particularly in Africa, which heavily influenced his poetry. He founded the Acmeist school of poetry, which championed clarity and concrete imagery.\n\n<<<Gumilyov>>>"
