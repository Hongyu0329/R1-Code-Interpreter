    "Within the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy, it is **Tadeusz Kotarbiński** who is credited with decomposing the notion of signs into **symptoms and signals** within the framework of his influential theory of praxeology, the science of efficient action.\n\nKotarbiński, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School and a student of its founder Kazimierz Twardowski, developed praxeology as a systematic study of purposeful actions. In this context, his analysis of signs was crucial. According to his framework, signs are first divided into two primary categories: symptoms and signals.\n\n*   **Symptoms** are understood as natural signs that have a causal or real connection to the state of affairs they indicate. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness.\n\n*   **Signals**, on the other hand, are signs that are not naturally connected to what they signify but are established by convention. Signals are further divided into asemantic appeals and semantic signals, with semantic signals being subdivided into motivated (iconic) and unmotivated (arbitrary) signs.\n\nWhile the term \"hallmark\" is not consistently found in direct translations of his work on this specific topic, the conceptual breakdown of signs into symptoms and signals is a key feature of his praxeological and semiotic analyses.\n\nIt is also important to note the foundational work of **Kazimierz Twardowski**, who established the Lviv-Warsaw School. Twardowski himself had a sophisticated theory of signs, in which he distinguished between *symptoms* (oznaki), which have a causal relationship with what they signify, and *symbols* (symbole), which are based on convention. This distinction laid the groundwork for the later semiotic investigations within the school. However, the specific classification into \"symptoms and signals\" is more directly attributed to Kotarbiński's praxeology.\n\n<<<Tadeusz Kotarbiński>>>"
