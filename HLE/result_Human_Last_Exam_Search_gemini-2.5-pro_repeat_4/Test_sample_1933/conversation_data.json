    "The analysis performed appears correct. The problem is equivalent to finding the VC dimension of the concept class of monotone monomials over 4 variables. The search results confirm this. Specifically, result and state that the VC dimension of monotone monomials over *n* variables is *n*.\n\nHere's the final argument:\n1.  **Analyze the Logic:** The set of classifiers corresponds to the formulas $\\phi(x)$ in the logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. The schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, say $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. A formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable `x` is of the general form $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since the predicates are unary, any atom is of the form $P_i(z)$ for some variable $z$.\n2.  **Simplify the Formulas:** The formula can be rearranged as $(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)) \\land (\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_{k_j}(z_j))$, where $z_j \\in \\{y_1, \\dots, y_m\\}$. The second part of this conjunction does not contain the free variable `x`. For any given model, this second part is a sentence that evaluates to either true or false. If it's false, the entire formula is equivalent to $\\bot$ (classifying nothing). If it's true, the formula is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$.\n3.  **Identify the Concept Class:** The available formulas are $\\top$, $\\bot$, and conjunctions of the predicates $P_i(x)$. This means the concept class for any model is the set of all possible intersections of the extensions of the four predicates. This is exactly the concept class known as \"monotone monomials\" over 4 variables.\n4.  **Determine the VC Dimension:**\n    *   **Upper Bound:** The concept class is generated by taking intersections of 4 base sets (the extensions of the predicates). The number of possible intersections is at most $2^4 = 16$. A concept class with at most 16 concepts can shatter a set of size $d$ only if $2^d \\le 16$, which implies $d \\le 4$. Therefore, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n    *   **Lower Bound:** We must show that a set of size 4 can be shattered. This requires constructing a specific model. Let the set to be shattered be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. Let the four predicates be $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. We define the extension of these predicates on $X$ as follows: for $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we define $x_j \\in P_i$ if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n        To select an arbitrary subset $T \\subseteq X$, we construct the formula $\\phi_T(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_T} P_i(x)$, where $I_T = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin T\\}$. An element $x_j$ satisfies this formula if and only if $x_j \\in P_i$ for all $i \\in I_T$. By our construction, this holds if and only if $j \\neq i$ for all $i \\in I_T$, which means $j \\notin I_T$. This, in turn, is equivalent to $x_j \\in T$. Thus, the formula $\\phi_T(x)$ correctly selects the set $T$. Since any subset $T \\subseteq X$ can be generated, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nThe search results confirm this conclusion. For instance, a paper by Natschläger and Schmitt proves that the VC dimension of the class of monotone monomials over *n* variables is *n* for all *n* ∈ ℕ. Another source confirms the same result.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
