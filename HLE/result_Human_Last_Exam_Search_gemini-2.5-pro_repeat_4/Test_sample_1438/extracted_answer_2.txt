In summary, the measure for a Grassmann variable integral does not have a specific numerical value. Its defining characteristic is the set of Berezin integration rules (∫ dψ = 0 and ∫ dψ ψ = 1). These rules are designed to be compatible with the anti-commuting nature of Grassmann variables (ψᵢψⱼ = -ψⱼψᵢ), from which the property ψ² = 0 naturally arises. This nilpotency (ψ² = 0) is the mathematical embodiment of the Pauli exclusion principle within the path integral formalism.
