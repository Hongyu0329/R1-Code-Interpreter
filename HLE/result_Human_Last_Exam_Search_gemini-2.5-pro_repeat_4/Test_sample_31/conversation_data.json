    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method, a solver must see a minimum of **5** non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following points:\n\n*   **Two-Sided Recognition:** Most advanced solvers learn \"2-sided PLL recognition,\" which involves identifying the case by looking at the six side stickers on two adjacent faces (for example, the front and right faces). This proves that six stickers are sufficient.\n*   **Parity and Deduction:** The state of the last layer is governed by parity rules. Once the positions of a certain number of pieces are known, the possible positions for the remaining pieces are limited. Looking at two adjacent sides reveals the sticker colors of three corner pieces and two edge pieces. This information, combined with parity constraints, is enough to deduce the state of the entire layer and thus identify the specific PLL case out of the 21 possibilities.\n*   **Information Redundancy:** While viewing two full sides (6 stickers) is a common method, it contains redundant information. A corner piece's identity and location can be determined by just two of its stickers since the top-facing color is already known to be correct.\n*   **The Minimum Number:** By eliminating this redundancy, it has been shown that information from only five stickers is required. It is possible to recognize any PLL case by seeing one sticker on each of the four corners and one sticker from one of the edges. This minimum is sometimes referred to as \"Straughan Recognition\" within the cubing community.\n\n<<<5>>>"
