Originally from Moldavia, he was transferred from the Snetogorsky monastery and, in 1731, was consecrated as the Bishop of Kolomna and Kashira. This information is confirmed by multiple historical sources, including the Orthodox Encyclopedia and other scholarly articles which note he was appointed head of the monastery on June 8, 1730. His predecessor was Filaret (1726–1729) and his successor was Kirill (1731–1732).\n\n<<<G>>>"
