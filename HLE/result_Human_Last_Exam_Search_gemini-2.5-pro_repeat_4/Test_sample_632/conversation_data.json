    "There is no historical record of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.\n\nThroughout its long history, the Piazza della Rotonda has undergone numerous transformations. In the 15th century, Pope Eugenius IV ordered the removal of a maze of sheds and small shops that had encroached upon the Pantheon. The well-known fountain at the center of the square, the Fontana del Pantheon, was designed by Giacomo Della Porta and constructed in 1575. Later, in 1711, an Egyptian obelisk was added to the fountain under the direction of Pope Clement XI.\n\nOne notable removal of an architectural feature was the demolition of the twin bell towers from the Pantheon itself, not the piazza. These towers, often pejoratively called the \"ass's ears,\" were added in the 17th century and taken down in 1883.\n\nWhile plans to demolish buildings around the Pantheon were proposed during the French administration of Napoleon in the early 19th century and again in an 1873 urban plan, these large-scale changes were never implemented. Historical accounts and images of the piazza from the 20th century do not indicate the removal of any significant or unique architectural feature in or around the year 1950.\n\n<<<I am unable to find any information about a unique architectural feature that was removed from Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. The most significant removal of an architectural feature in that area was the demolition of the Pantheon's twin bell towers in 1883.>>>"
