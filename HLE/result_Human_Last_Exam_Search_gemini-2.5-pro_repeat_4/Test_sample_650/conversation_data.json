    "The computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is determined by the number of iterations in the `while` loop and the complexity of the operations within it.\n\n### Analysis of the Algorithm:\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):** The operations before the loop (`i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a₀ := x — qc;`) are executed once. These are basic arithmetic operations (assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Assuming that `n` fits within a machine's word size, these operations take constant time, O(1).\n\n2.  **`while` loop (Step 2):**\n    *   **Loop Condition:** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   **Operations within the loop:** The operations inside the loop (`i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; aᵢ := x — qc`) are also basic arithmetic operations. Again, assuming standard integer sizes, each set of these operations takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   **Number of Iterations:** The crucial part is to determine how many times the loop executes. The value of `q` is initially `⌊n/c⌋`. In each iteration, the variable `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`. This is equivalent to repeatedly dividing `n` by `c`.\n        *   After 1 iteration, `q` is approximately `n/c²`.\n        *   After 2 iterations, `q` is approximately `n/c³`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, `q` is approximately `n/c^(k+1)`.\n    The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0, which happens when `n/c^k < 1`, or `c^k > n`. By taking the logarithm, we find that the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The number of digits in the base-c representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n\n3.  **Return (Step 3):** Returning the resulting sequence of digits takes time proportional to the number of digits, which is O(log_c(n)).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe dominant factor in the algorithm's runtime is the `while` loop, which executes O(log_c(n)) times. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_c(n)` is proportional to `log(n)` (due to the change of base formula for logarithms: `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`).\n\nTherefore, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is O(log n).\n\nThis analysis holds under the common assumption that the arithmetic operations on integers of the size of `n` can be performed in constant time. If `n` is an arbitrarily large number that requires multiple machine words for storage, the complexity of the arithmetic operations themselves would depend on the number of bits in `n` (which is `log n`), leading to a higher overall complexity such as O((log n)²). However, for a standard analysis of this algorithm, constant-time arithmetic is assumed.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
