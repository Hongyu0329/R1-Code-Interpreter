    "The rule activation level, also known as the firing strength, is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to the membership values of the inputs in the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part). While the context is an interval type-3 fuzzy set, the provided values are scalars (0.7 and 0.9), simplifying the calculation to a standard t-norm application. A t-norm generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy logic.\n\nThe specific t-norm to be used was not mentioned, and the result will vary depending on which one is chosen. The two most common t-norms are the **minimum (min)** and the **product**.\n\nHere are the calculations for the most common t-norms:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm**: This is the most widely used t-norm, also called the Gödel t-norm. It takes the minimum of the membership values.\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Using the Product t-norm**: This t-norm multiplies the membership values.\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nWithout further specification, the minimum t-norm is often the default assumption.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
