    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single, fixed value. Instead, it depends on the specific atoms that make up a molecule. The notation \"6-311G**\" defines how many primitives are used for each type of atom.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the number of primitive Gaussians for different atoms using the 6-311G** basis set:\n\n### Breakdown by Atom Type\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   **6-311G**: The valence 1s orbital is described by three separate functions (a triple-zeta basis). These are composed of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians, respectively. This gives a total of `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitive s-type functions.\n    *   **\\*\\***: The second asterisk indicates that polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms. This involves a single set of three p-type functions (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>), with each function being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds `3` primitive p-type functions.\n    *   **Total for Hydrogen = 5 + 3 = 8 primitive Gaussians.**\n\n*   **First-Row Heavy Atoms (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen):**\n    *   **6-311G**:\n        *   **Core (1s orbital):** The core orbital is represented by a single function composed of `6` primitive Gaussians.\n        *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The valence orbitals are split into three functions each, made from 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians.\n            *   For the 2s orbital: `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitive s-type functions.\n            *   For each of the three 2p orbitals (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>): `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives. This gives a total of `3 * 5 = 15` primitive p-type functions.\n    *   **\\***: The first asterisk indicates that polarization functions are added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. This adds a single set of d-type functions. In modern calculations, this is a set of five spherical d-functions, each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds `5` primitive d-type functions.\n    *   **Total for a First-Row Heavy Atom = 6 (core) + 5 (valence s) + 15 (valence p) + 5 (polarization d) = 31 primitive Gaussians.**\n\n*   **Second-Row and Heavier Atoms:**\n    For second-row atoms (like Si, P, S), the 6-311G basis set often uses a different contraction scheme, such as the McLean-Chandler basis sets, rather than strictly following the \"6-311\" rule. For example, for second-row atoms, it might use a set of 12 s-type and 9 p-type primitive Gaussians. Therefore, the number of primitives for these heavier elements does not follow the simple breakdown above and requires consulting specific basis set definitions.\n\n### Calculating for a Molecule\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you sum the primitives for each of its constituent atoms.\n\n**Formula for molecules with H, C, N, O, F:**\n\nTotal Primitives = (Number of H atoms × 8) + (Number of first-row heavy atoms × 31)\n\n**Example: Water (H₂O)**\n*   Oxygen (first-row heavy atom): 31 primitives\n*   Hydrogen: 8 primitives\n*   Total for H₂O = (1 × 31) + (2 × 8) = 31 + 16 = 47 primitive Gaussians.\n\n**Example: Methanol (CH₃OH)**\n*   Carbon (first-row heavy atom): 31 primitives\n*   Oxygen (first-row heavy atom): 31 primitives\n*   Hydrogen: 8 primitives\n*   Total for CH₃OH = (1 × 31) + (1 × 31) + (4 × 8) = 31 + 31 + 32 = 94 primitive Gaussians. This is consistent with published examples.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single number but is calculated per atom. For a hydrogen atom, it is 8. For a first-row heavy atom (like C, N, O), it is 31. The total for a molecule is the sum of the primitives for all of its atoms.>>>"
