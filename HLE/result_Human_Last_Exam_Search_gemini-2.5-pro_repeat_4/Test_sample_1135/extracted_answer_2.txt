Therefore, in the CCSD method, the matrix elements of the form $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are also zero for all triply, quadruply, and higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body terms, which results in the CCSD similarity-transformed Hamiltonian being an effective two-body operator.
