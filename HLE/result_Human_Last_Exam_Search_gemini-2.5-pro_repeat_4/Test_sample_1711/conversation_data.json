    "The smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$ is 1.\n\nHere is the reasoning for this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology**: Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. The question asks for the smallest size of a subset $A \\subseteq G$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\n2.  **Cyclic Subgroups**: A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element. For any element $g \\in G$, the set of all its integer powers, $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ (using multiplicative notation) or $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{kg \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ (using additive notation, as is appropriate for $G$), forms the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$.\n\n3.  **The Trivial Subgroup**: A crucial point is that the identity element of the group, in this case the zero vector $0 = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$, also generates a cyclic subgroup. This is the trivial subgroup, $\\{0\\}$. Standard definitions of cyclic groups and subgroups include this trivial case.\n\n4.  **Implication for the Set A**: The question states that *every* cyclic subgroup must contain an element of $A$. This means the condition must also hold for the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$. For the set $A$ to have a non-empty intersection with $\\{0\\}$, it must be that $A \\cap \\{0\\} \\ne \\emptyset$. This implies that the zero element, $0$, must be an element of $A$.\n\n5.  **Constructing the Minimal Set**: Now that we have established that $0 \\in A$, let's consider the set $A = \\{0\\}$. The size of this set is 1. Does it satisfy the condition for all cyclic subgroups of $G$?\n    *   Let $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n    *   By the definition of a subgroup, $H$ must contain the identity element, which is $0$.\n    *   Therefore, the intersection $H \\cap A = H \\cap \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   This intersection is non-empty.\n    *   Since this holds for any cyclic subgroup $H$, the set $A = \\{0\\}$ fulfills the condition.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on Minimum Size**: We have found a set $A = \\{0\\}$ of size 1 that satisfies the property. Since the group $G$ has cyclic subgroups, $A$ cannot be empty. Thus, the minimum possible size for $A$ is 1.\n\nThe large numbers in the problem description, $49$ and $2024$, are not relevant to the solution, which relies solely on the fundamental definitions of group theory.\n\n<<<1>>>"
