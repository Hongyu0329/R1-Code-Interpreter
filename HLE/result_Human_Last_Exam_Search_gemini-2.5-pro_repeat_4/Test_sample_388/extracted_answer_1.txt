Based on the information, the most immediate and critical counseling recommendation a pharmacist could make is to advise Allison about the increased risk of bleeding when taking Excedrin (which contains aspirin) with her prescription of Fluoxetine. For future headaches, she should consider using a different over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen and should discuss any persistent or unusual headache symptoms, such as the phantom smell of sea water, with her doctor. The smell could be a rare side effect of her atorvastatin or a symptom of a migraine aura.
