    "Let $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ be the Stone-Čech remainder. The space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, connected, non-compact space. The remainder $R$ is a continuum.\n\nA key result in continuum theory, established by the work of topologist Michel Smith, addresses the structure of such remainders. Smith constructed a non-metric, hereditarily indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants. A deeper theorem, building on this type of construction, shows that the Stone-Čech remainder of a punctured hereditarily indecomposable continuum is itself a hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n\nThe structure of a hereditarily indecomposable continuum is extremely rigid; any two of its subcontinua that intersect must be such that one contains the other. This property severely constrains the topological possibilities for the remainder. While a metric indecomposable continuum must have a number of composants equal to the cardinality of the continuum, non-metric indecomposable continua can have fewer. In the specific case of the remainder of a punctured hereditarily indecomposable continuum, this rigidity limits the number of a composants to exactly two. It is also an open question whether a nondegenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum can have only one composant, which makes two the established maximum.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder is two.\n\n<<<2>>>"
