    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we first determine the prime factorization of $N$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$, where each $\\chi_i$ has a conductor corresponding to a prime power factor of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its constituent characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nWe require this order to be $6$.\n\nFor the lcm to be $6$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of $6$.\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of $2$ and at least one multiple of $3$.\n\nLet's determine the number of available primitive characters for each prime power factor that satisfy the first condition. Let $n(m, d)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $m$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character, which has order 2. Since $2|6$, this character is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: $n(4, 2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo 3. The characters induced from modulo 3 have orders 1 and 2. Thus, the primitive characters are those of order 3 and 6. Both orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_2$: $n(9, 3) + n(9, 6) = \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders are 2, 3, and 6, all of which divide 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_3$: $n(7, 2) + n(7, 3) + n(7, 6) = \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The orders of primitive characters must divide 6, which means they must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$. Therefore, only primitive characters of order 2 are allowed.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: $n(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The orders of primitive characters must divide 6, which means they can be 2, 3, or 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_5$: $n(13, 2) + n(13, 3) + n(13, 6) = \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nNow, we verify the lcm condition. Let $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$.\n*   The presence of $\\chi_1$ (with $o_1=2$) and $\\chi_4$ (with $o_4=2$) guarantees that the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 2.\n*   For $\\chi_2$, the possible orders are 3 and 6. Both are multiples of 3. Thus, any choice for $\\chi_2$ ensures the lcm of the orders is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince any combination of the allowed characters will result in an order that is a multiple of both 2 and 3, the lcm will always be 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order $6$ is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber = (Choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_5$)\nNumber = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
