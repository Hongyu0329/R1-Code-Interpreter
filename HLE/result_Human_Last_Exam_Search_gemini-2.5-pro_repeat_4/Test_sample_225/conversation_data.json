    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)) can be determined from the integer ratio of the frequencies `a` and `b`. In this case, the curve is given by `(cos(9t), sin(5t))`, so `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\nA self-intersection occurs when two different values of the parameter `t` produce the same (x, y) coordinate. The curve is a Lissajous curve, and since the ratio `a/b` (which is 9/5) is rational, the curve is closed, meaning it retraces its path.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve where `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1) and both are odd integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nIn this specific case, `a = 9` and `b = 5` are both odd and their greatest common divisor is 1. Applying the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThus, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
