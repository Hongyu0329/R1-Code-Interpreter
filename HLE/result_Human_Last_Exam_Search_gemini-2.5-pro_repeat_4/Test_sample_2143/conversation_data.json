    "The full name of the individual \"HE\" referred to in Veronika Campan's interpretation is **Moses**.\n\nAccording to scholarly analysis of Véronique Campan's work, particularly her book \"Dix brèves histoires d'image,\" her interpretation of Krzysztof Kieślowski's film series \"The Decalogue\" is fundamentally linked to the original Ten Commandments. The discussion around the film series is framed by the context of the \"Mosaic law,\" the commandments that Moses is said to have received on Mount Sinai.\n\nCampan's analysis focuses on how the filmmaker Kieślowski artistically navigates the Decalogue. The interpretation mentioned in the prompt—of ignoring the prohibition against representation (the Second Commandment) to separately address the coveting of material possessions (the Tenth Commandment)—is an observation Campan makes about Kieślowski's directorial choices. However, the foundational \"work\" that is the subject of this interpretation is the Ten Commandments themselves, for which Moses is the traditional scribe and lawgiver. Therefore, Moses is the \"HE\" whose work is being ultimately interpreted.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
