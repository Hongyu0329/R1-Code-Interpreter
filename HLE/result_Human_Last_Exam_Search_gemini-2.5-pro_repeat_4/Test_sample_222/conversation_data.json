    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the 8-point sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`, we follow a standard procedure in digital signal processing that involves time-domain aliasing.\n\nFirst, let's identify the original 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`, from their given DFTs, `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\nThe given 4-point DFT for `x(n)` is `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`. This is a standard DFT pair, and the corresponding time-domain sequence `x(n)` is `{0, 0, 0, 1}`.\n\nThe 4-point DFT for `h(n)` is `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`. By applying the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT), we find the sequence `h(n)` to be `{3/4, -3/4, -1/4, 1/4}`.\n\nNext, we construct the 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\nSubstituting the values of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, we get:\n`y(n) = {0, 3/4, 0, -3/4, 0, -1/4, 1, 1/4}`\n\nThe problem asks for the 4-point DFT of this 8-point sequence. This is typically interpreted as finding the DFT of a 4-point sequence `g(n)` created by aliasing `y(n)` in the time domain. This is a concept related to decimation-in-time algorithms. The aliased sequence `g(n)` is defined as:\n`g(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet's compute `g(n)`:\n*   `g(0) = y(0) + y(4) = 0 + 0 = 0`\n*   `g(1) = y(1) + y(5) = 3/4 + (-1/4) = 1/2`\n*   `g(2) = y(2) + y(6) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n*   `g(3) = y(3) + y(7) = -3/4 + 1/4 = -1/2`\n\nSo, the resulting 4-point sequence is `g(n) = {0, 1/2, 1, -1/2}`.\n\nFinally, we compute the 4-point DFT of `g(n)`, which we will denote as `G(k)`:\n*   `G(0) = 0 + 1/2 + 1 - 1/2 = 1`\n*   `G(1) = 0 + (1/2)*(-j) + 1*(-1) + (-1/2)*(j) = -1 - j`\n*   `G(2) = 0 + (1/2)*(-1) + 1*(1) + (-1/2)*(-1) = 1`\n*   `G(3) = 0 + (1/2)*(j) + 1*(-1) + (-1/2)*(-j) = -1 + j`\n\nThis calculation can also be performed more directly using the properties of the DFT for interleaved sequences and the relationship between the DFT of a sequence and its decimated version. The 4-point DFT, `G(k)`, of the aliased sequence is equivalent to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, i.e., `G(k) = Y(2k)`. This method yields the same result.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
