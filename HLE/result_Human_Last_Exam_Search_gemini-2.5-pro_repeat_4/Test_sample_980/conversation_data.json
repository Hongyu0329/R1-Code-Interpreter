    "The provided sequence of numbers is: 111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124.\n\nThis sequence does not appear to be a standard, well-known mathematical sequence. A search of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and other mathematical resources does not yield a direct match for this series of numbers. The presence of repeated numbers and the specific values within the sequence suggest it may originate from a specific puzzle or a particular data set rather than a simple mathematical function.\n\nOne of the numbers in the sequence, 111, is known to be the number of steps it takes for the number 27 to reach 1 in the Collatz conjecture (or 3x+1 problem). The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics which concerns sequences generated by a simple rule: if a number is even, divide it by 2; if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1, and repeat. The number of steps taken to reach 1 from a starting number can be the same for different starting numbers, which might explain the repetitions in the given sequence. However, the sequence does not correspond to the number of Collatz steps for a simple sequence of starting integers.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear mathematical origin, the next number is most likely determined by a pattern within the sequence itself. Let's analyze the end of the sequence:\n\n... 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n\nA notable pattern here is a block of three `36`s followed by a block of three `124`s. After this, the sequence continues with a single `36` followed by a single `124`. This suggests a possible alternating pattern emerging. If this pattern of `36, 124` were to continue, the next number in the sequence would be 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
