    "There are 268 negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48. This result is a part of the broader Gauss class number problem, which seeks to classify all imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number. The complete enumeration for class numbers up to 100 was notably completed by Mark Watkins.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields involves determining, for any positive integer *n*, all the imaginary quadratic fields that have a class number of *n*. The class number itself is the order of the ideal class group of the field. For each such field, there is a unique corresponding negative fundamental discriminant. While the problem for a class number of 1 was conjectured by Gauss and later solved, determining the counts for larger class numbers has required significant computational effort.\n\nThe value for class number 48 is tabulated in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A046125, which lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number. This sequence is based on the comprehensive work by Mark Watkins in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\".\n\n<<<268>>>"
