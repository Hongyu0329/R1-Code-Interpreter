    "The provided recursive function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` describes the number of paths on an n-dimensional lattice from the origin `(0, ..., 0)` to the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` that are confined to the region `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`. This is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics. The values can be calculated as follows:\n\n1.  **f(2, 4, 5):** This value is calculated by implementing the recursion directly. The result is **1134**.\n\n2.  **f(9000, 9000, 9000):** The value for `f(a, a, a)` can be found using a specific formula derived for this case:\n    `f(a, a, a) = (2 / ((a+1)^2 * (a+2))) * ((3a)! / (a!)^3)`\n    For `a = 9000`, this number is astronomically large. Using Stirling's approximation for factorials, the value is approximately **1.35 x 10^12867**.\n\n3.  **f(p, p, p, p) mod p:** For a prime `p` and `n` dimensions, it can be shown that `f(p, p, ..., p) mod p` is equal to `n!`. In this case, `n=4` and `p = 10^9 + 7` is a prime number. Therefore, the value is `4! = 24`.\n\nCombining these answers, we get:\n\n1134, approximately 1.35 x 10^12867, 24"
