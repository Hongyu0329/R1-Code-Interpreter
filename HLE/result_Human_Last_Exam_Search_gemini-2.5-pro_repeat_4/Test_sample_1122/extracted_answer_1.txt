The provided amino acid sequence represents **Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PD)**.

This protein is from *Homo sapiens* (humans) and is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. Its primary function is to produce NADPH, a molecule crucial for protecting cells from oxidative damage. The UniProt database, a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and functional information, lists this protein under the accession number P11413.

The gene that encodes G6PD is also named G6PD and is located on the X chromosome. Mutations in this gene can lead to G6PD deficiency, a genetic disorder that can cause hemolytic anemia. Some of the search results show the sequence as part of a recombinant protein, often with a "His-tag" added for purification in laboratory settings.
