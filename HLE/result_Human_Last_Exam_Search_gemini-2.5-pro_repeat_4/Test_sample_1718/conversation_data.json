    "On a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n` (and therefore real dimension `2n`), the Riemann tensor possesses more symmetries than on a general Riemannian manifold. These additional symmetries significantly reduce the number of its independent components.\n\nA general `m`-dimensional Riemannian manifold has a Riemann tensor with `m^2(m^2 - 1) / 12` independent components. For a Kähler manifold of real dimension `m = 2n`, this would give `n^2(4n^2 - 1) / 3` components if no further symmetries were considered.\n\nHowever, a Kähler manifold `(M, g, J)` is defined by the existence of a complex structure `J` that is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection `∇` (i.e., `∇J = 0`). This condition imposes strong constraints on the Riemann tensor.\n\nThe key consequences for the curvature tensor `R` on a Kähler manifold are:\n*   In complex coordinates `(z^1, ..., z^n)`, the only components that can be non-zero are of the form `R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}`, where indices without a bar refer to the holomorphic part and indices with a bar refer to the anti-holomorphic part of the complexified tangent space.\n*   The tensor exhibits the additional symmetry `R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}} = R_{k\\bar{j}i\\bar{l}}`.\n\nThese symmetries mean that the Riemann tensor is entirely determined by a Hermitian form on the space of symmetric tensors of type (2,0). The complex dimension of this space is `n(n+1)/2`. A Hermitian form on a complex vector space of dimension `d` has `d^2` independent real components.\n\nTherefore, the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n` is:\n\n`(n(n+1)/2)^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 / 4`\n\nFor example:\n*   For `n = 1` (a 2-dimensional surface), the number of independent components is `(1^2 * 2^2) / 4 = 1`. This is consistent with the fact that for any 2D manifold, the Riemann tensor is determined by a single function (the scalar curvature).\n*   For `n = 2` (a 4-dimensional manifold like a K3 surface), the number of independent components is `(2^2 * 3^2) / 4 = 9`. This is a significant reduction from the 20 independent components of a general 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold.\n\n<<<The number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n` is `(n(n+1)/2)^2`.>>>"
