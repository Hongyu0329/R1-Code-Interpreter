The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value and differs for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, optimal nickel content can range from as low as 2 wt% to as high as 12.5 wt%, depending on the specific catalyst support and reaction conditions. For water splitting, particularly the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), a higher nickel content is generally more effective, with optimal molar ratios of Ni to Ce being in the range of 1:1 to 3:1.
