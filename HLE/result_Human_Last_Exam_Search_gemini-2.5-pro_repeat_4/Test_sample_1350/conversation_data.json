    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is a man of the House of the Gael, as recounted by the Elking warrior Hiarandi, who describes his experiences in a Roman city. However, his description does not contain any allusions to the religious practices involving Romulus and Remus.\n\nIn Chapter VI, \"They Talk on the Way to the Folk-Thing,\" the Elking warrior Hiarandi shares what he learned from a man of the House of the Gael who had been captured and enslaved by the Romans. This man provides a glimpse into Roman society, its social structure, and its methods of warfare. Hiarandi tells the Wolfing warrior Wolfkettle that in Roman cities, there is great confusion of kindred, and mighty men dictate the lives of others, even those considered free. He also mentions that the Romans have many cities filled with immense wealth.\n\nThe narrative from the man of the Gael focuses on the harshness of his enslavement, noting that the Romans treated their thralls worse than their beasts of burden. His account highlights the Roman military might and social hierarchy, contrasting it with the ways of the Germanic tribes.\n\nWhile the Wolfings themselves have a wolf on their banner and their warriors are marked with the image of a wolf, this is a totemic emblem of their own house and is not connected to the Roman founding myth. Extensive searches of the text and scholarly analyses reveal no passage where a character describes the Roman religious practices in a way that would be recognizable as the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<A man of the House of the Gael, as recounted by the Elking warrior Hiarandi.>>>"
