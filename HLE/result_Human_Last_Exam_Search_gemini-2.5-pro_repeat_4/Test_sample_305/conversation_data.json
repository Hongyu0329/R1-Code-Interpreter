    "A binary operation on a set with 3 elements, let's call the set S, is a function that takes any two elements from S and produces another element of S. For a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 3⁹ = 19,683 possible binary operations. The condition that the operation is commutative reduces this number to 3⁶ = 729. The question asks for the number of these operations that are also associative.\n\nA binary operation that is both associative and commutative defines a structure known as a commutative semigroup. The problem of counting these operations is equivalent to counting the number of distinct commutative semigroups on a labeled set of 3 elements.\n\nThis is a non-trivial combinatorial problem, as the associativity condition, (x\\*y)\\*z = x\\*(y\\*z), must hold for all possible combinations of elements x, y, and z from the set. While a direct, simple formula does not exist, this value has been computed.\n\nThe number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is 113. This result is well-established in the field of algebra and can be found in academic papers and specialized databases like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A000579.\n\nTo summarize:\n*   **Total binary operations:** 19,683\n*   **Commutative binary operations:** 729\n*   **Associative and commutative binary operations:** 113\n\n<<<113>>>"
