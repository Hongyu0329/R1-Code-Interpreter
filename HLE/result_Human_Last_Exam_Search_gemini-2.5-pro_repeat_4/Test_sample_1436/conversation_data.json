    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a crucial element in perturbative calculations, representing the number of equivalent ways to arrange the internal lines and vertices that result in the same topological diagram. The specific value depends on the topology of the diagram in question.\n\nGiven a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (propagators), the most natural interpretation in a common theory like φ⁴ theory (where each vertex connects four lines) is a connected vacuum diagram where two vertices are linked directly by four propagators. This is sometimes referred to as a \"melon\" diagram.\n\nThe symmetry factor (S) for this diagram can be calculated by considering the permutations of its components that leave the graph unchanged:\n\n1.  **Vertex Permutations:** The diagram has two vertices. Since they are indistinguishable, they can be swapped without changing the diagram's topology. This contributes a factor of 2! = 2.\n2.  **Propagator Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are also identical. They can be permuted among themselves in 4! = 24 ways.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors.\n\nS = (Number of vertex permutations) × (Number of propagator permutations)\nS = 2! × 4!\nS = 2 × 24\nS = 48\n\nThis result can be confirmed by considering the combinatorial factors that arise from the Wick expansion in perturbative theory. The contribution of this diagram comes from the second-order term in the expansion of the exponential involving the interaction Lagrangian. For a λφ⁴ theory, this term is `(1/2!) * (λ/4!)²`. The number of ways to contract the eight fields (four from each vertex) to form the four propagators connecting the two vertices is 4! = 24. The overall numerical factor for the diagram is therefore `(1/2!) * (1/4!)² * 24 = 1/48`. The symmetry factor is the inverse of this numerical prefactor.\n\nIt is worth noting that other diagram topologies with two vertices and four propagators exist, such as a \"double-scoop\" diagram with two propagators connecting the vertices and one loop at each vertex. However, the description most directly implies that all four propagators are involved in connecting the two distinct vertices.\n\n<<<48>>>"
