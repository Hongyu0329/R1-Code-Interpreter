    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned on one of its faces, the base is a horizontal equilateral triangle. If this tank is half-filled with water, the water's surface, being a horizontal plane, will form a specific shape by intersecting the icosahedron's faces.\n\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Due to its symmetry, when it rests on a face, the horizontal plane that bisects the volume passes through the center of the icosahedron. The intersection of this central plane with the icosahedron results in a regular hexagon. This is because the plane cuts through six of the triangular faces, creating a six-sided polygon. The high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron ensures that this hexagon is regular, with all sides and angles being equal.\n\nTherefore, the shape of the water's surface will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
