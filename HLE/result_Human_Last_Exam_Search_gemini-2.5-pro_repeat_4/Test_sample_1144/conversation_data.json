    "### Calculation of the Ratio of Momentum Uncertainty to Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit\n\nTo determine the ratio of the uncertainty of the electron's momentum to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will first calculate the momentum of the electron and then its momentum uncertainty based on the provided position uncertainty.\n\n**1. Momentum of the Electron in the First Bohr Orbit (p)**\n\nAccording to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in a given orbit is quantized and is given by the formula:\nL = nħ\nwhere:\n*   n is the principal quantum number (for the first orbit, n=1)\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n\nThe angular momentum is also defined as L = mvr = pr, where 'p' is the linear momentum and 'r' is the orbit's radius.\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum is L = 1 * ħ = ħ.\n\nTherefore, the linear momentum 'p' can be expressed as:\np = ħ / r\n\nThe radius of the first Bohr orbit (a₀) is a well-established physical constant, approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ meters.\n\nNow, we can calculate the momentum:\np = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Uncertainty of the Momentum (Δp)**\n\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle provides the relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The principle is expressed as:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWe are given the uncertainty in the electron's position:\nΔx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n\nUsing the minimum uncertainty from the principle, we can find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴) / (20 x 10⁻¹²) kg·m/s\nΔp = 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Ratio of Momentum Uncertainty to Momentum (Δp/p)**\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum itself:\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio = (5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nRatio ≈ 2.646\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
