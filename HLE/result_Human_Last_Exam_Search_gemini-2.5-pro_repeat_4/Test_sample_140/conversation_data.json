    "The user wants to find the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n\nMy previous analysis led to the answer 351. I broke down the problem by dividing the 15x15x15 cube into successively smaller blocks and packing the 9x1x1 blocks in orthogonal directions.\n\n1.  A 9x15x15 section, which fits `(9/9) * (15/1) * (15/1) = 225` blocks.\n2.  A 6x15x15 remaining section. From this, I take a 6x9x15 section (orienting the blocks differently), which fits `(6/1) * (9/9) * (15/1) = 90` blocks.\n3.  A 6x6x15 remaining section. From this, I take a 6x6x9 section (orienting the blocks a third way), which fits `(6/1) * (6/1) * (9/9) = 36` blocks.\n4.  The final remaining block is 6x6x6, into which no 9x1x1 block can fit.\n5.  Total = 225 + 90 + 36 = 351.\n\nI also verified this by dividing the cube into 8 regions based on the `15 = 9 + 6` split, which yielded the same result.\n\nThe google searches did not return this specific problem. They returned similar problems about packing blocks, but the dimensions are different. The search results confirm that for such problems, one cannot simply divide the volumes. One must consider the geometry of the packing. My methodical approach of dividing the cube and packing in stages is a standard way to solve these problems.\n\nThe logic seems sound and has been checked by a second method (partitioning the cube). The wasted space is a 6x6x6 cube, into which a 9-unit long block cannot fit. Therefore, it seems no more blocks can be placed.\n\nI am confident in my answer of 351.\n\n<<<351>>>"
