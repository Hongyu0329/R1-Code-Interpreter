    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM), followed by electrophilic quenching.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents**:\n    *   **Substrate**: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two potential directing metalation groups (DMGs) on the benzene ring: the N,N-diethylamido group (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3.\n    *   **Base**: sec-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi) is a very strong organolithium base, more basic and sterically hindered than n-butyllithium. It is capable of deprotonating even weakly acidic C-H bonds, such as those on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Ligand**: Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) is a chelating ligand that coordinates to the lithium ion. This coordination breaks down the oligomeric aggregates of the organolithium reagent, increasing its reactivity.\n    *   **Solvent**: Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is a common etheral solvent for organolithium reactions.\n    *   **Electrophile**: Methyl iodide (CH₃I) is an electrophile that will react with the organolithium intermediate.\n\n2.  **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**:\n    *   The first step is the deprotonation of an aromatic proton by the sec-BuLi/TMEDA complex. This is not a random process; the position of deprotonation is guided by a directing metalation group (DMG). The DMG coordinates to the lithium ion, delivering the base to a nearby *ortho* position.\n    *   In N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, both the amide and the dimethylamino groups are effective DMGs. We must consider the regiochemical outcome based on the positions of these groups.\n    *   The N,N-diethylamido group (-CONEt₂) at C1 directs metalation to the C2 and C6 positions.\n    *   The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at C3 directs metalation to its *ortho* positions, which are C2 and C4.\n    *   Both groups direct the lithiation to the C2 position. The directing ability of different groups has been studied, and the tertiary amide group (-CONR₂) is known to be one of the most powerful directing groups, generally stronger than a tertiary amine (-NR₂). The cooperative effect of both groups pointing to the C2 position makes it the overwhelmingly favored site for deprotonation.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction with sec-BuLi/TMEDA will selectively remove the proton at the C2 position, forming a potent aryllithium nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Electrophilic Quench**:\n    *   The second step involves adding methyl iodide to the reaction mixture.\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate, with its nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position, will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide.\n    *   This results in a nucleophilic substitution, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and displacing the iodide ion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe sequence of reactions—*ortho*-lithiation at the C2 position directed by both the amide and dimethylamino groups, followed by methylation with methyl iodide—results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThe final compound is:\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
