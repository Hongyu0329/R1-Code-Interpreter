    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is one that provides complete (100%) protection to a proportion of vaccinated individuals, while offering no protection to the rest. In this model, the value calculated as `1 - incidence rate ratio (IRR)` represents the overall vaccine efficacy (VE). This calculated VE estimates the *proportion* of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\nTo determine if this overestimates or underestimates the *per-exposure* vaccine efficacy, we must compare two values:\n*   **1 - IRR:** The overall measured vaccine efficacy, which reflects the proportion of people protected. For example, if a vaccine is 80% effective, the `1 - IRR` would be 0.8.\n*   **Per-exposure vaccine efficacy:** The reduction in risk for a single exposure to the pathogen. For an individual successfully protected by an all-or-nothing vaccine, their risk of infection per exposure is zero, meaning their per-exposure efficacy is 100% (or 1.0). For those not protected by the vaccine, their per-exposure efficacy is 0%.\n\nThe `1 - IRR` calculation averages the perfect protection in one subgroup with the zero protection in another, resulting in a value that reflects the *size* of the protected group. For any individual who is actually protected, their per-exposure efficacy is 100%. Therefore, the calculated overall efficacy (e.g., 80%) is less than the per-exposure efficacy experienced by protected individuals (100%).\n\nBecause the `1 - IRR` is a measure of the *proportion* of the population protected, it will be lower than the 100% per-exposure efficacy experienced by the successfully vaccinated individuals. Thus, `1 - IRR` underestimates the per-exposure efficacy for those in whom the vaccine works.\n\n<<<B>>>"
