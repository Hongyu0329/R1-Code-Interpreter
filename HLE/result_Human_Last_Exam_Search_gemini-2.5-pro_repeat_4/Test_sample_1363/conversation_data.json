    "To determine in which dance it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique, one must analyze the fundamental mechanics of each dance.\n\nIn the swing dances—Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep—turns are generated and controlled through the use of Contra Body Movement (CBM), body sway, and rise and fall. CBM is the action of turning the opposite side of the torso toward the moving leg, which helps initiate and power the rotation. This use of swing and momentum allows a skilled dancer to modify the amount of turn, making it technically possible to either underturn or overturn a figure like the Reverse Turn. While a standard figure has a prescribed amount of rotation, manipulating it is a common aspect of floorcraft and advanced choreography.\n\nThe European Tango, however, operates on a different set of principles. Its technique is characterized by a \"staccato\" action, with no rise and fall, and a compact frame. Movement is typically direct and sharp, progressing from one position to the next with a controlled, and sometimes delayed, transfer of weight.\n\nCrucially, the turning mechanism in Tango is different. While CBM is used, it's more of a torquing action within a flat, level frame rather than the flowing, swinging motion of the other ballroom dances. Reverse turns in Tango are constructed with specific foot placements and body alignments that create a precise amount of turn. To force more rotation than the figure allows—to \"overturn\" it—would require abandoning the core Tango techniques of a stable, level frame and controlled, staccato footwork. It would necessitate introducing a twisting action that is fundamentally at odds with the character and technical foundation of the dance. As one video analysis explains, overturning a step in Tango can completely change the figure into a different one, such as a Fallaway. Therefore, overturning a reverse turn in Tango is not possible without fundamentally violating its technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
