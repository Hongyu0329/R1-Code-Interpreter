    "The Wittig reaction is a versatile method for synthesizing alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a phosphorus ylide, which is a reagent with a positively charged phosphorus atom bonded to a negatively charged carbon atom. This reaction results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon double bond, replacing the carbon-oxygen double bond of the starting material.\n\nIn this specific case, the reactants are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is known for its bulky tert-butyl group.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane:** This is the phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. Its structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(o-ClC₆H₄).\n\nThe reaction proceeds by the nucleophilic attack of the ylide's carbanion on the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde. This leads to the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe product of the reaction is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe structural formula of the product is: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting alkene (whether it is the E or Z isomer) depends on the nature of the ylide.\n\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides**, which typically have alkyl groups attached to the carbanion, usually lead to the formation of the (Z)-alkene as the major product under standard conditions.\n*   **Stabilized ylides**, which have electron-withdrawing groups, predominantly yield the (E)-alkene.\n\nThe ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, is considered non-stabilized because the ylidic carbon is attached to an alkyl group (an ethyl group substituted with a phenyl ring). Therefore, the reaction is expected to favor the formation of the Z-isomer (cis). However, the significant steric hindrance from the bulky tert-butyl group of pivalaldehyde could influence the stereochemical outcome, potentially increasing the proportion of the more thermodynamically stable E-isomer (trans). Without specific reaction conditions, it is presumed that a mixture of E and Z isomers will be formed, with the Z-isomer likely being the major product.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
