    "The user is asking for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\n2.  **Identify the object of study**: We are interested in the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The cohomology ring is the direct sum of cohomology groups: $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_k H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The torsion subgroup of the ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each group.\n\n3.  **Consult the literature on the cohomology of real Grassmannians**:\n    *   According to Ehresmann, the torsion of the integral homology of real Grassmannians is all of order 2. The universal coefficient theorem relates homology torsion to cohomology torsion. Specifically, $T_{k+1}(H_{k}(M, \\mathbb{Z})) \\cong T_k(H^k(M, \\mathbb{Z}))$. This implies that all torsion in the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian is 2-torsion.\n    *   For a complex projective manifold $X$, if the integral cohomology $H^*(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free, then the rational cohomology determines the integral cohomology. However, real Grassmannians are not complex manifolds in general and can have torsion.\n    *   A key theorem by Borel states that for a compact connected Lie group G, the cohomology $H^*(G; \\mathbb{Z})$ has no p-torsion for any odd prime p. This result extends to Stiefel manifolds and Grassmannians. This confirms that any torsion must be 2-torsion.\n    *   The rational cohomology of real Grassmannians is well-understood. The difference between rational and integral cohomology reveals the torsion part.\n    *   A paper by He states that the rational singular cohomology rings of real Grassmannians have long been known.\n    *   A MathOverflow question discusses the integral cohomology of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. It mentions that $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is homeomorphic to $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. A paper by Casian and Kodama is cited which computes the cohomology groups for $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. The answer there suggests that the integral cohomology groups are:\n        *   $H^0(\\mathbb{Z})$\n        *   $H^1(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$\n        *   $H^2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$\n        *   $H^3(0)$\n        *   $H^4(\\mathbb{Z})$\n        *   $H^5(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$\n        *   $H^6(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$\n    *   Let's verify this structure. The paper \"On the integral homology of the real Grassmannian manifolds\" by J. D. Junkins (1979), referenced in, provides a table with the integral homology groups of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $n \\le 7$. For $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ (and thus $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$), the homology groups are given as:\n        *   $H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n        *   $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        *   $H_2 = 0$\n        *   $H_3 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        *   $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        *   $H_5 = 0$\n        *   $H_6 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   Now, we use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology, which gives the short exact sequence for each $k$:\n        $0 \\to \\text{Ext}^1(H_{k-1}(M; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^k(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_k(M; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\n        This sequence splits (non-naturally), so $H^k(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_k(M; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{k-1}(M; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n        Let $T_k = \\text{Torsion}(H_k(M; \\mathbb{Z}))$. We know that $\\text{Hom}(H_k, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{\\text{rank}(H_k)}$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(H_{k-1}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong T_{k-1}$.\n        Let's apply this to the homology groups of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5) \\cong G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$:\n        *   $H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$, $T_0=0$\n        *   $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$, $T_1=\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        *   $H_2 = 0$, $T_2=0$\n        *   $H_3 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$, $T_3=\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        *   $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$, $T_4=\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        *   $H_5 = 0$, $T_5=0$\n        *   $H_6 = \\mathbb{Z}$, $T_6=0$\n\n        Now we compute the integral cohomology groups $H^k$:\n        *   $H^0 \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{-1}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$. Torsion part $T^0=0$.\n        *   $H^1 \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{0}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus 0 = 0$. Torsion part $T^1=0$.\n        *   $H^2 \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{1}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus T_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Torsion part $T^2=\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n        *   $H^3 \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_3, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{2}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$. Torsion part $T^3=0$.\n        *   $H^4 \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_4, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{3}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus T_3 = 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Torsion part $T^4=\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n        *   $H^5 \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_5, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{4}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus T_4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Torsion part $T^5=\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n        *   $H^6 \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_6, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1(H_{5}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus 0 = \\mathbb{Z}$. Torsion part $T^6=0$.\n\n        So the integral cohomology groups are:\n        $H^0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n        $H^1 = 0$\n        $H^2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        $H^3 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n        $H^4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        $H^5 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        $H^6 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n        And $H^k=0$ for $k>6$.\n\n        The information from the MathOverflow answer seems incorrect regarding the specific groups, but the presence of torsion is correct.\n\n4.  **Determine the torsion subgroup of the ring**: The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group:\n    $T = T^0 \\oplus T^1 \\oplus T^2 \\oplus T^3 \\oplus T^4 \\oplus T^5 \\oplus T^6$\n    $T = 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus 0 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the rank**: The question asks for the rank of this torsion subgroup $T$. The rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition into cyclic groups. Since $T$ is a direct sum of finite cyclic groups, it is a torsion group. The rank of any finite abelian group is 0.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 0. This seems too simple and might misinterpret the user's intent. A common confusion is between the \"rank\" and the \"number of torsion coefficients\" or the \"order\" of the torsion group.\n- The number of non-trivial torsion subgroups is 3 ($T^2, T^4, T^5$).\n- The order of the torsion subgroup is $|\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2| = 2^3 = 8$.\n- The number of generators of the torsion subgroup is 3.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"rank of the torsion subgroup\", the only mathematically correct answer is 0. If the user meant something else, the question is ambiguous. However, answering the question as written is the most direct approach. I will state the structure of the torsion subgroup for clarity and then give the rank.\n\nFinal check: The cohomology of real Grassmannians is known to have only 2-torsion. My calculation based on the homology groups from the literature confirms this. The steps to derive the cohomology from homology via the Universal Coefficient Theorem are standard. The definition of the rank of an abelian group is unambiguous. The conclusion that the rank is 0 is therefore sound.\n\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. The integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is the direct sum of its integral cohomology groups $H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe integral homology groups of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, which is homeomorphic to $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, are known. Using the Universal Coefficient Theorem, the integral cohomology groups can be determined. The torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups $H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^4(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k > 6$.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each degree:\n$T = \\text{Torsion}(H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})) \\cong H^2_{tors} \\oplus H^4_{tors} \\oplus H^5_{tors} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its decomposition. The group $T$ is a finite abelian group, also known as a torsion group. By definition, the rank of any finite abelian group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, which is the Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, is 0.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ possess torsion components. Specifically, the torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is derived from the individual cohomology groups:\n*   $H^2(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe other cohomology groups are torsion-free. The total torsion subgroup is the direct sum of these torsion groups. As a finite abelian group, its rank is, by definition, zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
