    "There have been 28 Triple Crowns won by 23 players in Major League Baseball history, a figure that now includes statistics from the Negro Leagues. This recognition of Negro League players has officially expanded the list of winners, celebrating athletes who were previously excluded from MLB's official records.\n\nA player achieves the batting Triple Crown by leading their league in three key offensive categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI).\n\n### Integration of Negro League Records\n\nIn 2020, Major League Baseball announced that it was elevating seven Negro Leagues that operated between 1920 and 1948 to \"Major League\" status. This decision meant that the statistics of approximately 3,400 players from that era would be incorporated into MLB's official historical record. As a result, eight players from the Negro Leagues were added to the list of Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Multi-Time Winners\n\nOf the 23 players who have won a Triple Crown, four have accomplished the feat more than once. Oscar Charleston holds the record with three Triple Crowns (1921, 1924, 1925). The other multi-time winners are:\n*   Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n*   Josh Gibson (1936, 1937)\n*   Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n\n### The Most Recent Winner\n\nThe most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera, who did so in 2012 while playing for the Detroit Tigers. His achievement ended a 45-year drought, with the previous winner being Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.\n\n### List of Triple Crown Winners\n\nHere is a list of the recognized Triple Crown winners in MLB history, including players from the American League, National League, and Negro Leagues:\n\n| Year | Player | Team | League |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1878 | Paul Hines | Providence Grays | National League |\n| 1887 | Tip O'Neill | St. Louis Browns | American Association |\n| 1894 | Hugh Duffy | Boston Beaneaters | National League |\n| 1901 | Nap Lajoie | Philadelphia Athletics | American League |\n| 1909 | Ty Cobb | Detroit Tigers | American League |\n| 1912 | Heinie Zimmerman | Chicago Cubs | National League |\n| 1921 | Oscar Charleston | Homestead Grays | Negro National League |\n| 1922 | Rogers Hornsby | St. Louis Cardinals | National League |\n| 1923 | Heavy Johnson | Kansas City Monarchs | Negro National League |\n| 1924 | Oscar Charleston | Harrisburg Giants | Eastern Colored League |\n| 1925 | Rogers Hornsby | St. Louis Cardinals | National League |\n| 1926 | Mule Suttles | St. Louis Stars | Negro National League |\n| 1930 | Willie Wells | St. Louis Stars | Negro National League |\n| 1933 | Chuck Klein | Philadelphia Phillies | National League |\n| 1933 | Jimmie Foxx | Philadelphia Athletics | American League |\n| 1934 | Lou Gehrig | New York Yankees | American League |\n| 1936 | Josh Gibson | Pittsburgh Crawfords | Negro National League II |\n| 1937 | Joe Medwick | St. Louis Cardinals | National League |\n| 1937 | Josh Gibson | Homestead Grays | Negro National League II |\n| 1942 | Ted Williams | Boston Red Sox | American League |\n| 1942 | Lennie Pearson | Newark Eagles/Homestead Grays | Negro National League II |\n| 1942 | Ted Strong | Kansas City Monarchs | Negro American League |\n| 1947 | Ted Williams | Boston Red Sox | American League |\n| 1956 | Mickey Mantle | New York Yankees | American League |\n| 1966 | Frank Robinson | Baltimore Orioles | American League |\n| 1967 | Carl Yastrzemski | Boston Red Sox | American League |\n| 2012 | Miguel Cabrera | Detroit Tigers | American League |\n\n***\n\n<<<23>>>"
