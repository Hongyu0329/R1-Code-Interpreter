    "Of the irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, there are 58 that have a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. For $S_{25}$, we consider the partitions of 25. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is calculated using the hook-length formula. An irrep and the one corresponding to its conjugate partition have the same dimension.\n\nBy systematically calculating the dimensions for partitions of 25, we can identify those that satisfy the given condition. The dimensions are smaller for partitions that are \"far from the center,\" meaning they have a few very large parts or, conjugately, many small parts.\n\nThe partitions with a dimension less than 500,000 are listed below, along with their dimensions. Each of these partitions is not self-conjugate, and their conjugate partitions are distinct from any other in the list.\n\n**Partitions with dimensions < 500,000:**\n\n*   **Corresponding to n=25:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(25)$: dimension = 1\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 24:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(24,1)$: dimension = 24\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 23:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: dimension = 275\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: dimension = 276\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 22:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: dimension = 2,000\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: dimension = 2,275\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: dimension = 2,024\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 21:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,4)$: dimension = 10,350\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$: dimension = 24,750\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$: dimension = 12,650\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,1,1)$: dimension = 31,500\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,1,1,1,1)$: dimension = 10,626\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 20:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,5)$: dimension = 40,480\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,4,1)$: dimension = 81,600\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$: dimension = 116,280\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,1,1)$: dimension = 154,700\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,2,1)$: dimension = 116,280\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,1,1,1)$: dimension = 232,050\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,1,1,1,1,1)$: dimension = 42,504\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 19:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,6)$: dimension = 123,970\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,5,1)$: dimension = 253,968\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,4,2)$: dimension = 414,720\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,4,1,1)$: dimension = 490,314\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,3,3)$: dimension = 347,490\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,2,2,2)$: dimension = 414,720\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,1,1,1,1,1,1)$: dimension = 134,596\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 18:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,7)$: dimension = 469,546\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)$: dimension = 346,104\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 17:**\n    *   $\\lambda=(17,8)$: dimension = 434,929\n\nThis gives a total of 29 distinct partitions. For each of these partitions $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is also a partition of 25, it is distinct from $\\lambda$ and all other partitions in the list, and the dimension of its corresponding irrep is the same. Therefore, we have 29 pairs of partitions, leading to a total of $29 \\times 2 = 58$ irreducible representations.\n\n<<<58>>>"
