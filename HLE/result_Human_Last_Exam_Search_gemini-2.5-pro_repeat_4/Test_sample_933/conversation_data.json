    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly and efficiently synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas in a nickel vessel. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of 400°C with a xenon to fluorine molar ratio of 1:5.\n\nSeveral sources confirm that 400°C is the optimal temperature for this synthesis. A patent for the production of xenon tetrafluoride specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction. Flow methods have also been described, involving passing the gas mixture through a nickel tube heated to 300-500°C.\n\nWhile other methods and temperatures exist for the synthesis of xenon fluorides, they are either for different compounds (like XeF₂ or XeF₆) or are noted to be less efficient for producing pure XeF₄. For instance, synthesis using an electric discharge at low temperatures can produce XeF₄, but it often results in significant contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF₂), making it an inefficient method for obtaining pure XeF₄.\n\nConsidering the provided options, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently through well-established methods.\n\n<<<B>>>"
