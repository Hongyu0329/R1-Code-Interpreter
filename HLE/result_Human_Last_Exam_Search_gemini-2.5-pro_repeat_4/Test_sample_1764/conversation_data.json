    "A fundamental result by Shkarin states that any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into any infinite-dimensional Banach space. This implies that for an infinite-dimensional Banach space B, there is at least one such embedding.\n\nLet's analyze the number of possible isometric embeddings. If $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding, then for any isometry $T: B \\to B$ that is not the identity on the image of $f$, the composition $T \\circ f$ is a distinct isometric embedding. The number of such isometries of a Banach space can be large. For example, if $B$ is a Hilbert space, there are infinitely many isometries (rotations, reflections). This indicates that there can be infinitely many isometric embeddings in an infinite-dimensional Banach space.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the *smallest possible* number of isometric embeddings. This suggests we should consider cases where the Banach space $B$ might have very few isometries.\n\nConsider the case where the Banach space $B$ is finite-dimensional. Let the dimension of $B$ be $n$. A result mentioned in the search results states that if an ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, it can have at most $n+1$ points. Let $|X| = m$. If $m > n+1$, no isometric embedding exists. If an isometric embedding exists, the question is about the smallest number of them.\n\nSome metric spaces, termed \"linearly rigid,\" admit a unique isometric embedding up to isometry into a Banach space, for embeddings whose image is linearly dense. While it is not established that a general finite ultrametric space is linearly rigid, this concept points to the possibility of having a unique embedding under certain conditions.\n\nLet's consider the trivial case of a one-point ultrametric space $X = \\{x_0\\}$. Any map $f: X \\to B$ defined by $f(x_0) = b$ for some $b \\in B$ is an isometric embedding. Since there are $K$ points in $B$, there are $K$ such embeddings.\n\nNow, let's consider a non-trivial finite ultrametric space $X$.\n\nIf there exists an isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$, then for any vector $b_0 \\in B$, the map $g(x) = f(x) + b_0$ is also an isometric embedding, since the norm of the difference is invariant under translation: $\\|g(x) - g(y)\\| = \\|(f(x) + b_0) - (f(y) + b_0)\\| = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x, y)$. Since there are $K$ possible choices for the vector $b_0$ (the number of points in the Banach space), there are at least $K$ such embeddings, provided one exists.\n\nThe question then becomes whether an isometric embedding must exist. As established by Shkarin, for any finite ultrametric space $X$, an isometric embedding into any infinite-dimensional Banach space always exists. For a finite-dimensional Banach space $B$ of dimension $n$, an isometric embedding of $X$ exists if $|X| \\le n+1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest possible number, which implies we should look for the minimum number across all possible finite ultrametric spaces $X$ and Banach spaces $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nIf we can find a Banach space $B$ and a finite ultrametric space $X$ for which there is exactly one isometric embedding (up to translations), then the number of embeddings would be $K$.\n\nConsider the case where the Banach space has no non-trivial isometries that fix the origin. In such a scenario, if $f$ is an isometric embedding, all other embeddings would be of the form $f(x) + b_0$.\n\nLet's consider the minimal possible number of embeddings.\nIf there is no isometric embedding, the number of embeddings is 0. This can happen if, for instance, the Banach space is of a low dimension and the ultrametric space is large.\n\nIf at least one isometric embedding exists, say $f$, then for every element $b \\in B$, the function $f_b(x) = f(x) + b$ is also an isometric embedding. This gives at least $K$ embeddings.\n\nCan there be more? Let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be two isometric embeddings. Is it always the case that $f_2(x) = f_1(x) + b$ for some $b$? Not necessarily. Let $U: B \\to B$ be an isometry of the Banach space. Then $g(x) = U(f_1(x))$ is also an isometric embedding. If $U$ is not a simple translation, then the image of $g$ is a rotated/reflected version of the image of $f_1$.\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest possible* number. If we can find a scenario with just one embedding, this would be the answer.\n\nLet's consider the most constrained case. Take a finite ultrametric space $X$. If we can embed it into $\\mathbb{R}$ (a 1-dimensional Banach space), then there is a very limited set of isometries (reflection and translation). Let $|X|=2$, say $X=\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with $d(x_1, x_2) = d$. We can embed this into $\\mathbb{R}$ by mapping $x_1$ to 0 and $x_2$ to $d$. This is an isometric embedding. Any other embedding is of the form $x \\mapsto \\pm f(x) + c$.\n\nHowever, the question does not restrict the choice of $X$ and $B$. If we want the smallest possible number, we can consider the most trivial case.\n\nIf we take any finite ultrametric space $X$, and a Banach space $B$ such that no isometric embedding from $X$ to $B$ exists, then the number of embeddings is 0. For example, let $X$ be a three-point space with all distances equal to 1, and let $B$ be the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. It is not possible to isometrically embed three points with equal pairwise distances into $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, for this combination of $X$ and $B$, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nSince the question asks for the smallest *possible* number, and we have found a case where the number is 0, this should be the answer. The problem does not state that an embedding must exist for any given pair of $X$ and $B$.\n\nLet's double-check the reasoning. The question is \"What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of X in B?\". This implies we are looking for $\\min_{X, B} |\\text{Emb}(X, B)|$, where $\\text{Emb}(X, B)$ is the set of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$.\n\nAs shown, there are pairs $(X, B)$ for which $\\text{Emb}(X, B)$ is empty. For instance, let $X$ be the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length 1, which is an ultrametric space if we define the distance between any two distinct points to be 1. Let $B = \\mathbb{R}$. An isometric embedding of these three points into $\\mathbb{R}$ is not possible. Therefore, for this specific $X$ and $B$, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nSince the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
