    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the submarine **Doris** (Q135).\n\nThe *Doris*, a *Circé*-class coastal submarine, was sunk by the German U-boat U-9 on the night of May 8-9, 1940, off the Dutch coast. The submarine had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons and a submerged displacement of 776 tons.\n\nOther French naval losses during this period were attributed to other causes such as mines, accidents, or air and surface attacks. For instance, the submarine *Morse* was lost to a mine in May 1940. Larger French warships were sunk later in the war, such as the battleship *Bretagne* at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940 by British forces, or were scuttled by their own crews, as was the case with a significant portion of the French fleet at Toulon in November 1942. The submarine *Sfax*, which was larger than the *Doris*, was also sunk by a German U-boat, but this occurred in December 1940, after the armistice.\n\n<<<Doris>>>"
