    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a long or tense vowel becomes short or lax when it is in a syllable followed by two or more syllables. This process often occurs when a suffix is added to a word, shifting the stress and creating the necessary phonological environment.\n\nHere's an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **southern**: The vowel change in *south* to *southern* is an example of trisyllabic laxing. Historically, *southern* was three syllables (*southerne*, pronounced /ˈsuː.ðər.nə/), which caused the long vowel of *south* (from Old English *sūþ*) to shorten.\n*   **derivative**: This word shows the laxing of the tense vowel in *derive* (/dɪˈraɪv/) to a lax vowel in *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/). This change from /aɪ/ to /ɪ/ is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: This word is a textbook example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense /iː/ vowel in *serene* becomes the lax /ɛ/ vowel in *serenity* when the suffix *-ity* is added, making the affected syllable the third from the end.\n*   **pleasant**: The vowel shortening in *please* to *pleasant* is an instance of disyllabic laxing, a different, though related, process. It is not trisyllabic laxing because *pleasant* only has two syllables.\n*   **gratitude**: The tense vowel in a related word like *grateful* (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/) becomes a lax vowel in the trisyllabic word *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/). This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This word comes from the Old English *sceadwe* and was an oblique case of *sceadu* (\"shade\"). Unlike the other words on the list, it doesn't demonstrate a sound change where a long vowel in a base word is shortened by the addition of a suffix in English. The relationship between *shade* and *shadow* is not one of suffix-driven vowel laxing; they are distinct nouns that evolved from a common Old English root.\n\nBased on this analysis, all the words except one show some form of vowel laxing when compared to a related base word. *Serenity*, *gratitude*, *derivative*, and *southern* are all examples of trisyllabic laxing (with *southern* being a historical case). *Pleasant* shows disyllabic laxing. *Shadow*, however, did not develop through a process of vowel shortening caused by suffixation in English.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
