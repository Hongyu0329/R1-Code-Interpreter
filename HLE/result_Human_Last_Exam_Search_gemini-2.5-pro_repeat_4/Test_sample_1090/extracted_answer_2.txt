The most appropriate next step is to initiate specific management for the developing knee flexion contracture, likely secondary to post-stroke spasticity exacerbated by immobility. This would involve an intensified regimen of passive range of motion, stretching, and potentially splinting or casting to address the mechanical impediment to ambulation. While nutritional consultation and support are also critically important due to the patient's low BMI and are necessary for recovery, addressing the direct physical barrier that is causing physical therapy to fail is the most immediate priority to enable progress.
