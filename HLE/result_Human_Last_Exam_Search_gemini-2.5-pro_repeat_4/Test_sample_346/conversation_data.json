    "To find the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to determine the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression. The expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))(B)))`\nwhere:\n*   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n*   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\n### Step 1: Decode the components A and B\n\nThe combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the standard SKI representation of the successor function for Church numerals. Let's call it `succ`.\n\nThe combinator `I` is the SKI representation for the Church numeral 1. Therefore, `A` is the successor of 1:\n`A = succ(I) = succ(1) = 2`\n\nThe combinator `S(I)(I)` is the self-application combinator, often denoted as `ω` (omega), where `ω(x) = x(x)`. So, `B` is the successor of `ω`:\n`B = succ(S(I)(I)) = succ(ω)`\nIn lambda calculus, `succ(ω)` translates to `λf.λx. f(ω f x)`, which simplifies to `λf.λx. f((f f) x)`. For the purpose of this problem, let's call this combinator `Q`.\n\n### Step 2: Parse the full expression\n\nThe structure of SKI expressions can be ambiguous without explicit parentheses. A common and logical parsing for this expression, which leads to a coherent result, is `(S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))))))(B)`. Let's evaluate this step-by-step:\n\n1.  Let `H1 = S(I)(K(A))`. This reduces to `λy. y(A)`.\n2.  Let `H2 = S(I)(H1)`. This reduces to `λz. z(H1 z)`, which is `λz. z(z A)`.\n3.  Let `H3 = S(I)(H2)`. This reduces to `λw. w(H2 w)`, which is `λw. w(w(w A))`.\n\nThe full expression `n` is `H3(B)`, which means we apply `B` to `H3`:\n`n = (λw. w(w(w A))) (B) = B(B(B A))`\n\nSubstituting `A=2` and `B=Q`, we get:\n`n = Q(Q(Q 2))`\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the expression `n`\n\nWe need to determine what the combinator `Q` does when applied to a Church numeral. Let `m` be a Church numeral. We evaluate `(Q m)`. In lambda calculus, this means applying `Q` to `m`. The result is a new function which we then apply to `f`:\n\n`(Q m) f = (λg.λx. g((gg)x)) m f` is not the correct way. Instead, we use the definition of `Q` where `f` becomes `m`:\n`(Q m) f = m((m m)f)`\n\nThe term `(m m)` represents the application of the Church numeral `m` to itself. In Church arithmetic, `m n f = m(n f)`, which corresponds to multiplication `(n * m)f`. Therefore, `(m m)f` is equivalent to `(m*m)f = (m^2)f`.\n\nNow we can substitute this back:\n`(Q m) f = m((m^2)f)`\n\nApplying the multiplication rule again, `m((m^2)f)` becomes `(m^2 * m)f = (m^3)f`.\nThis means that applying the combinator `Q` to a Church numeral `m` results in the Church numeral `m^3`.\n\n`Q m = m³`\n\nNow we can calculate `n`:\n*   `h₀ = 2`\n*   `h₁ = Q(h₀) = Q(2) = 2³ = 8`\n*   `h₂ = Q(h₁) = Q(8) = 8³ = (2³)³ = 2⁹`\n*   `n = Q(h₂) = Q(2⁹) = (2⁹)³ = 2²⁷`\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` is `2^27`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate log₂(n)\n\nThe final step is to calculate the base-2 logarithm of `n`:\n`log₂(n) = log₂(2²⁷) = 27`\n\n<<<27>>>"
