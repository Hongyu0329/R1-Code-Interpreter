Based on the analysis of the provided search results, it is generally not possible to stabilize a localized soliton in a 3D Hamiltonian with only the Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Additional energy terms such as an external magnetic field or magnetic anisotropy are typically necessary for stability.
