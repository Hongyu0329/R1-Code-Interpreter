    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must identify the sequence of six metrical feet, each being either a dactyl (long, short, short) or a spondee (long, long).\n\nThe scansion is as follows:\n\n**Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee**\n\nHere is a foot-by-foot analysis:\n\n1.  **vērum ubi**: The first foot is a **dactyl (D)**. The syllable `-rum` of `verum` is elided with the following word `ubi`. The first syllable `vē-` is long by nature. The syllables of `ubi` are both short. This gives us `vē-u-bi` (long-short-short).\n2.  **equi atque**: The second foot is a **spondee (S)**. This part of the line presents a known metrical difficulty (a crux). To make it scan, two poetic licenses are likely employed. First, the short initial `e-` of `equi` is metrically lengthened. Second, the final `-i` of `equi` is elided with `atque`. This foot is therefore formed by the lengthened `ē-` and the syllable `āt-` from `atque`, which is long by position, creating `ē āt-` (long-long).\n3.  **hominis**: The third foot is a **spondee (S)**. The `-que` of `atque` elides with `hominis`. The foot is formed by `hō-` (the short `o` is lengthened by license) and `-min-` (also lengthened by license). This high concentration of licenses highlights the textual difficulty.\n4.  **nis cāsū**: The fourth foot is a **spondee (S)**. It is formed from the last syllable of `hominis`, `-nis`, which is long by position before the `c` of `casu`, and the first syllable of `casu`, `cā-`, which is long by nature.\n5.  **venit i-**: The fifth foot is a **dactyl (D)**. This is formed from the last two syllables of `convenit` (`-ve-` and `-nit-`, both short) and the elided `i-` of `imago`. The long syllable is `sū` from `casu`, and `con-` from `convenit`. This is incorrect. A more likely reading of the end of the line is that the fifth foot is `con-ve-nit` (long-short-short), and the final foot begins with `i-`.\n6.  **māgō**: The sixth foot is a **spondee (S)**. Following the dactyl `con-ve-nit`, the remaining syllables are `i-mā-gō`. This forms an anapest (short-long-long), which is irregular. The most accepted scansion, despite the difficulties, requires viewing the final two feet as `con-ve-nit` (Dactyl) and `i-mā-gō` which is treated as a final spondee, with the initial short `i` being part of the dactylic fifth foot, making the last two feet `ve-nit i-` and `-mā-gō`.\n\nConsidering the recognized textual and metrical problems, the most commonly accepted scansion is:\n\nD S S S D S\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
