    "Based on its highly specialized hearing abilities, the **herring** is the animal that might be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n\nThe sound produced by a contracting human muscle is of a very low frequency, around 25 +/- 2.5 Hz. However, it is the herring that is noted for its exceptional hearing. Fish are often categorized as \"hearing generalists\" or \"hearing specialists.\" Herring fall into the specialist category due to a unique adaptation: a gas-containing sphere that connects their swim bladder directly to their hearing system. This connection significantly enhances their hearing sensitivity, allowing them to perceive a very wide range of sound frequencies.\n\nWhile most fish are limited to hearing frequencies below 1,000 Hz, herring can detect sounds up to at least 4,000 Hz. Some members of the herring family (shads) can even detect ultrasonic frequencies as high as 180 kHz, likely as a defense against echolocating dolphins. This broad and sensitive hearing range makes the herring capable of detecting incredibly subtle sounds that other animals cannot.\n\n<<<C>>>"
