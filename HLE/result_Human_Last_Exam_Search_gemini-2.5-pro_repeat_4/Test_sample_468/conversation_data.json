    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is \"fairy bee\". This name is widely used in both popular and scientific literature. For example, entomology resources like BugGuide and various university extension websites refer to the genus *Perdita* as fairy bees. Specific species within the genus also carry this common name, such as the \"Eight-spotted fairy bee\" (*Perdita octomaculata*) and the \"Mojave poppy bee\" (*Perdita meconis*), which is described as a type of fairy bee.\n\nWhile the common name is well-established, the exact year it was coined is not readily available in the searched resources. The genus *Perdita* was first described by Frederick Smith in 1853. The term \"fairy bee\" likely came into use later, but a precise date is not documented in the available information.\n\n<<<fairy bee, unknown>>>"
