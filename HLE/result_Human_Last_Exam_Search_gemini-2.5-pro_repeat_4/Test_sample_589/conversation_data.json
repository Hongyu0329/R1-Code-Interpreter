    "After an extensive search for a Hollywood feature film produced by a major studio in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car, no such scene has been definitively identified.\n\nNumerous searches were conducted using a variety of keywords related to the scene, including \"teenager pink bike oncoming car,\" \"movie scene playing chicken on bicycle,\" and \"coming of age film pink bike dare.\" These searches led to discussions of various films with prominent bicycle scenes, such as \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,\" \"Now and Then,\" \"The Karate Kid,\" \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure,\" and \"Rad,\" but none of the descriptions of these films or their notable scenes match the specific query.\n\nThe concept of \"playing chicken\" was also explored, with several results referencing scenes where cars drive toward each other, but none involving a teenager on a pink bicycle. Additionally, searches for movies from specific eras, such as the 80s and 90s, with rebellious teen themes or bicycle stunts did not yield a match.\n\nWhile there are many online discussions and videos on platforms like TikTok and Reddit where users inquire about similar scenes, none have led to the identification of a specific major Hollywood feature film that includes a teenager on a pink bike pedaling directly at an oncoming car.\n\nIt is possible the scene in question is from a foreign film, an independent movie, a television show, or a music video, or that details of the scene may have been misremembered. However, based on the available search results, there is no major Hollywood feature film that can be confirmed to contain the described scene.\n\n<<<I am unable to find a Hollywood feature film that matches the description.>>>"
