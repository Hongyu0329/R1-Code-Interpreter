    "An integral surgery on a knot can produce a homology 3-sphere, which represents an element in the homology cobordism group. To determine how many distinct elements can be formed from knots with at most four crossings, we must identify these knots and the homology spheres resulting from surgery on them.\n\nThe prime knots with a crossing number of four or less are the trefoil knot (3-1) and the figure-eight knot (4-1). We also consider the unknot (0_1). For an integral surgery on a knot to result in a homology sphere (a manifold with the same integer homology groups as the 3-sphere, S³), the surgery coefficient must be +1 or -1.\n\nHere is an analysis of the elements generated by each knot:\n\n*   **The Unknot (0_1):** Performing a +1 or -1 surgery on the unknot results in the 3-sphere, S³. In the context of the homology cobordism group, S³ represents the trivial (or zero) element. Thus, the unknot only generates the **trivial element**.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3_1):** The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. However, surgery on both the left-handed and right-handed trefoil knots yields elements that are either the Poincaré homology sphere or its orientation-reversed counterpart. Specifically, -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil produces the Poincaré sphere. This renowned homology sphere is a non-trivial element in the homology cobordism group. It is known to have order 2, meaning it is homology cobordant to its reverse orientation. Therefore, both +1 and -1 surgery on either chirality of the trefoil knot represent the same single **non-trivial element**.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4_1):** The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image. It is a known result in topology that ±1 surgery on the figure-eight knot produces a homology sphere that is homology cobordant to S³. This means it also represents the **trivial element** in the homology cobordism group. While 0-surgery on the figure-eight knot is a topic of significant research, for the purposes of generating homology spheres via integral surgery, it only yields the trivial element.\n\nIn summary, the knots with at most four crossings give rise to two distinct elements in the homology cobordism group:\n\n1.  The **trivial element**, generated by the unknot and the figure-eight knot.\n2.  A single **non-trivial element** (the class of the Poincaré homology sphere), generated by the trefoil knot.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of two such elements.\n\n<<<2>>>"
