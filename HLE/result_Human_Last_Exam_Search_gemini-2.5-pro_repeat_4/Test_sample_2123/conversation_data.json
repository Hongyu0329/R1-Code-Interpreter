    "The surname of the English poet is Longfellow.\n\nIn the Russian translation of an essay by Joseph Brodsky, while describing the wide boulevards of Vienna, a pun is used. The Russian phrase for \"wide boulevards\" can be playfully interpreted. The surname \"Longfellow\" is humorously broken down and translated literally into Russian as \"длинный малый\" (dlinnyy malyy), which means \"long fellow.\" This phrase is then used metaphorically to describe the expansive boulevards of Vienna, creating a clever literary allusion.\n\n<<<Longfellow>>>"
