    "The question of the smallest number of a composants an indecomposable continuum can have requires careful consideration of the definitions and known results in point-set topology.\n\nFirst, to clarify the terms:\n*   A **continuum** is a compact, connected Hausdorff space. The user's specification \"not necessarily metric\" is crucial.\n*   An **indecomposable continuum** is one that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A key property is that every proper subcontinuum of an indecomposable continuum is nowhere-dense.\n*   A **composant** of a point *x* in a continuum is the set of all points that lie in a proper subcontinuum with *x*. The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space.\n\nFor the familiar case of **metric indecomposable continua** (such as the bucket handle, solenoids, or the pseudo-arc), the answer is definitively known. A classical theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that every indecomposable metric continuum has *c* (the cardinality of the continuum) composants. This is because:\n1.  The number of composants must be uncountable. A proof relies on the Baire Category Theorem: if the number of composants were countable, the whole space (a compactum, hence a Baire space) would be a countable union of meager sets (since composants are unions of nowhere-dense subcontinua), which is a contradiction.\n2.  The number of composants is at most *c*. This follows from the fact that metric continua are separable (have a countable dense subset).\n\nHowever, the problem is more complex for **non-metric continua**. The user explicitly included this case, which dramatically changes the possible answers. Research by D.P. Bellamy in the 1970s showed that the results for the metric case do not generalize. He constructed non-metric indecomposable continua with surprising properties, including:\n*   An indecomposable continuum with exactly **two** composants.\n*   An indecomposable continuum with exactly **one** composant.\n\nA continuum with only one composant might seem to contradict the definition of indecomposability. However, in these non-metric examples, the single composant is a proper, dense subset of the whole space, a situation that cannot occur in the metric setting.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have depends on whether a metric space is required.\n*   If the continuum is **metric**, the smallest (and only possible) number of composants is *c*.\n*   If the continuum is **not necessarily metric**, the smallest number of composants is two.\n\nGiven the user's specific phrasing \"(not necessarily metric)\", the most accurate answer is two.\n\n<<<2>>>"
