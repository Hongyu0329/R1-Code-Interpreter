The displacement field **D** through the transistor is the vector sum of the fields created by the top and bottom gates. The magnitude of the displacement field from the top gate is $D_{tg} = C_{tg}V_{tg}$, and from the back gate is $D_{bg} = C_{bg}V_{bg}$. Since they are in opposite directions, the net displacement field is given by the expression: **D** = ($C_{bg}V_{bg} - C_{tg}V_{tg}$)**ẑ**, where **ẑ** is the unit vector in the direction from the back gate to the top gate.
