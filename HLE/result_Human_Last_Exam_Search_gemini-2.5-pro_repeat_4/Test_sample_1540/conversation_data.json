    "To solve this problem with the most memory-efficient C program, we need to minimize the amount of memory allocated for variables. The standard approach of reading both strings into two separate character arrays is robust but can be optimized.\n\nA more memory-efficient solution involves storing only the first string. The second string can then be read one character at a time and compared on the fly with the corresponding character in the stored first string. This eliminates the need for a second large buffer.\n\nAdditionally, we can optimize the data type for the loop index. Since the string length is at most 100, a `char` variable (1 byte) is sufficient to act as a counter, which is smaller than a typical `int` (4 bytes).\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program for this task:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case,\n * with a focus on minimal memory usage.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer is required to store the first string to compare it against\n    // the second. Its size is 101 to accommodate the maximum length of 100\n    // characters plus the null terminator '\\0'.\n    char s1[101];\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // This variable will hold the current character being read from the second string.\n    char c2;\n\n    // A 'char' is used for the loop index as its 1-byte size is sufficient\n    // for a string length up to 100, making it more memory-efficient than a 4-byte 'int'.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // Loop through the first string until its end.\n    while (s1[i]) {\n        // Read one character from the standard input for the second string.\n        // The format specifier \" %c\" is key: the leading space skips all\n        // whitespace (like the newline after the first string) before reading\n        // the next non-whitespace character.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c2);\n\n        // Compare the lowercase versions of the characters.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) != tolower(c2)) {\n            // If they differ, print -1 or 1 based on the comparison and exit.\n            // The ternary operator here is a compact way to determine the output.\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2) ? -1 : 1);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, it means all characters were equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of each declared variable. We assume a standard environment where a `char` is 1 byte.\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: This is a character array to store the first string. It allocates space for 101 characters.\n    *   Memory = 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 byte = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **`char c2;`**: This variable stores a single character from the second string at a time.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n3.  **`char i;`**: This variable is used as a loop index.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = **103 bytes**.\n\n<<<103>>>"
