    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA complete classification of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua reveals three distinct classes:\n\n*   **The simple closed curve (the circle):** This is the most familiar example of a homogeneous continuum.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a more complex, fractal-like object that, unlike the circle, contains no arcs.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This is another intricate structure, which can be thought of as a \"circle\" where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n\nThis classification, a long-standing question in topology, was finalized by the work of Hoehn and Oversteegen in 2014.\n\nIn addition to these three non-degenerate continua (continua with more than one point), the **single point** also fits the definition of a homogeneous planar continuum, forming its own class.\n\nThus, when considering all homogeneous planar continua, both degenerate and non-degenerate, there are a total of four homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
