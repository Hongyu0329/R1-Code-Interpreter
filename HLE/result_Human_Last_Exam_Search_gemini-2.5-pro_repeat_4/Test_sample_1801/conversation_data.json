    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign, which aired in 2000, featured a series of short interviews with prominent thinkers. Among them was Murray Gell-Mann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles. The other Nobel laureate identified in the commercials is Amartya Sen, an Indian economist who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics.\n\nThe commercials were part of a larger public relations effort by Enron to portray itself as an innovative and forward-thinking company. The tagline \"Ask Why\" was meant to encourage a sense of curiosity and questioning of the status quo, a message that would later be seen as deeply ironic in light of the massive accounting fraud that led to Enron's collapse in 2001.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
