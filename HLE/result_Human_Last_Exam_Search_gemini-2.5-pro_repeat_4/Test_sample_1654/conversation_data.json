    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the protagonist, Police Superintendent Otchumyelov, is described with his greatcoat at five distinct moments, with the act of taking it off and putting it on symbolizing his shifting mentality and fearful deference to authority.\n\nThe descriptions of the coat are as follows:\n\n1.  At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm.\" This initial description establishes his official status and outward appearance of authority.\n\n2.  When it is first suggested that the dog belongs to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov immediately changes his tune and, feeling \"frightfully hot,\" asks his subordinate, Yeldyrin, to help him off with his coat. This action visually represents his sudden sycophantic panic and his desire to appease the powerful.\n\n3.  After a policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's demeanor shifts again. He feels a sudden chill and says, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up.... I am cold.\" His renewed sense of authority and dismissal of the victim is symbolized by him putting the coat back on.\n\n4.  Upon learning that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov once again feels \"hot\" and orders his coat to be taken off. This repeated action further emphasizes his \"chameleon-like\" nature, instantly changing his stance based on the perceived social standing of the dog's owner.\n\n5.  In the final scene, after the matter is resolved in favor of the powerful, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat before departing. This final act signifies his return to his official, authoritative persona, having successfully navigated the socially precarious situation.\n\nThese repeated descriptions of Otchumyelov's interactions with his coat serve as a powerful and humorous symbol of his hypocrisy, cowardice, and the absurdity of the rigid social hierarchy of the time.\n\n<<<5>>>"
