    "The search results are not directly giving the prime factorization of 53599. Result gives the factorization of 160797 as 3 * 53599, and then says to factor 53599. It states that 53599 is divisible by 13, giving 4123. Then 4123 is 7 * 589. And 589 is 19 * 31. Let me double check this. 13 * 7 * 19 * 31 = 91 * 589 = 53599. The factorization seems to be correct.\n\nSo, $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis is a product of distinct primes, so the conductor $d$ is square-free.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is a product of characters modulo its prime factors:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo $p$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be primitive modulo $d$, each $\\chi_p$ must be a primitive character modulo $p$.\nA character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is non-principal. The only non-primitive character modulo $p$ is the principal character $\\chi_0$, which has order 1.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is `lcm(ord(χ₇), ord(χ₁₃), ord(χ₁₉), ord(χ₃₁))`. We want this to be 6.\nLet $o_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. We need $\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$.\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The order of a character $\\chi_p$ must divide $p-1$.\nLet's look at the possible orders for the characters for our primes:\n*   For $p=7$, the orders of non-principal characters must divide $7-1=6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n*   For $p=13$, the orders of non-principal characters must divide $13-1=12$. The possible orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n*   For $p=19$, the orders of non-principal characters must divide $19-1=18$. The possible orders are 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.\n*   For $p=31$, the orders of non-principal characters must divide $31-1=30$. The possible orders are 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n\nFor `lcm(o₇, o₁₃, o₁₉, o₃₁) = 6`, the following conditions must be met:\n1.  All orders $o_p$ must be divisors of 6. That is, $o_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  At least one order must be 3 or 6 (i.e., divisible by 3).\n3.  At least one order must be 2 or 6 (i.e., divisible by 2).\n4.  Since we need primitive characters modulo $d$, each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal, so $o_p \\neq 1$. Thus, for our problem, $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's find the number of characters of order $k$ for each prime modulus. The number of characters of order $k$ modulo $p$ is $\\phi(k)$, provided $k | (p-1)$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7 (p-1=6):**\n    *   $N_7(2) = \\phi(2)=1$\n    *   $N_7(3) = \\phi(3)=2$\n    *   $N_7(6) = \\phi(6)=2$\n*   **Modulo 13 (p-1=12):**\n    *   $N_{13}(2) = \\phi(2)=1$\n    *   $N_{13}(3) = \\phi(3)=2$\n    *   $N_{13}(6) = \\phi(6)=2$\n*   **Modulo 19 (p-1=18):**\n    *   $N_{19}(2) = \\phi(2)=1$\n    *   $N_{19}(3) = \\phi(3)=2$\n    *   $N_{19}(6) = \\phi(6)=2$\n*   **Modulo 31 (p-1=30):**\n    *   $N_{31}(2) = \\phi(2)=1$\n    *   $N_{31}(3) = \\phi(3)=2$\n    *   $N_{31}(6) = \\phi(6)=2$\n\nLet $S_p = \\{ \\text{ord}(\\chi_p) \\mid \\chi_p \\text{ is a non-principal character mod } p \\}$.\nFor the lcm to be 6, the orders $o_p$ must be in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nLet $n_p(k)$ be the number of non-principal characters mod $p$ of order $k$. For $k>1$, this is $\\phi(k)$ if $k | (p-1)$.\nSo, for all our primes $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, we have:\n*   $n_p(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n*   $n_p(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n*   $n_p(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\nLet's count the number of combinations of orders $(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31})$ that result in `lcm = 6`.\nLet $C_p$ be the set of allowed orders for $\\chi_p$, so $C_p = \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for all $p$.\nThe total number of choices for the orders is $(1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$. This is the total number of primitive characters whose orders divide 6.\n\nWe need to subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6.\nThe lcm is not 6 if it is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3.\nThe order cannot be 1 as all $\\chi_p$ are non-principal.\n\nCase A: `lcm(o_p) = 2`. This means all $o_p \\in \\{2\\}$.\nThere is only one choice for each $p$: order 2.\nNumber of characters: $n_7(2) \\times n_{13}(2) \\times n_{19}(2) \\times n_{31}(2) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nCase B: `lcm(o_p) = 3`. This means all $o_p \\in \\{3\\}$.\nNumber of characters: $n_7(3) \\times n_{13}(3) \\times n_{19}(3) \\times n_{31}(3) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\nThe number of characters of order 6 is the total number of characters with order dividing 6, minus those with order dividing 2, minus those with order dividing 3. The character with order 1 is counted in both subtractions, but since we are only considering non-principal characters, order 1 is not possible.\n\nLet $N_k$ be the number of primitive characters of order dividing $k$.\nEach $\\chi_p$ must have order dividing $k$.\nLet $A_p(k)$ be the number of non-principal characters mod $p$ whose order divides $k$.\n$A_p(k) = \\sum_{j|k, j>1} n_p(j)$.\n\n*   $A_p(6) = n_p(2) + n_p(3) + n_p(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n*   $A_p(3) = n_p(3) = 2$.\n*   $A_p(2) = n_p(2) = 1$.\n\nTotal number of primitive characters with order dividing 6 is $N_6 = A_7(6) \\times A_{13}(6) \\times A_{19}(6) \\times A_{31}(6) = 5^4 = 625$.\nTotal number of primitive characters with order dividing 3 is $N_3 = A_7(3) \\times A_{13}(3) \\times A_{19}(3) \\times A_{31}(3) = 2^4 = 16$.\nTotal number of primitive characters with order dividing 2 is $N_2 = A_7(2) \\times A_{13}(2) \\times A_{19}(2) \\times A_{31}(2) = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nLet $C(k)$ be the number of primitive characters of order exactly $k$.\n$C(6) = N_6 - N_3 - N_2$.  (This is because the set of characters of order dividing 3 and the set of characters of order dividing 2 are disjoint, except for the principal character which we have excluded).\nSo, $C(6) = 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nLet me re-verify this logic using inclusion-exclusion.\nLet $S$ be the set of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where each $\\chi_p$ is non-principal and its order divides 6.\n$|S| = (1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nLet $P_2$ be the property that the lcm of the orders divides 2 (i.e., all orders are 1 or 2). Since we exclude order 1, all orders must be 2.\nNumber of tuples with property $P_2$: $N(P_2) = (n_7(2)) \\times (n_{13}(2)) \\times (n_{19}(2)) \\times (n_{31}(2)) = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nLet $P_3$ be the property that the lcm of the orders divides 3 (i.e., all orders are 1 or 3). Since we exclude order 1, all orders must be 3.\nNumber of tuples with property $P_3$: $N(P_3) = (n_7(3)) \\times (n_{13}(3)) \\times (n_{19}(3)) \\times (n_{31}(3)) = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe number of characters of order 6 is the total number of possibilities in $S$ minus those where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6. The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. Order 1 is not possible.\nSo we need to subtract the cases where the lcm is 2 or 3.\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $|S| - N(P_2) - N(P_3) = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nThe logic seems sound. The steps were:\n1.  Factorize $d=53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n2.  Recognize that a primitive character $\\chi$ mod $d$ is a product of non-principal characters $\\chi_p$ mod the prime factors.\n3.  The order of $\\chi$ is the lcm of the orders of the $\\chi_p$.\n4.  We need `lcm(ord(χ₇), ord(χ₁₃), ord(χ₁₉), ord(χ₃₁)) = 6`.\n5.  This implies the orders of all $\\chi_p$ must divide 6, must not be 1, and the set of orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n6.  The number of non-principal characters mod p of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k|(p-1)$ and $k>1$.\n7.  For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, $(p-1)$ is divisible by 6.\n8.  The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n9.  The number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n10. The number of characters of order 6 is $\\phi(6)=2$.\n11. Total number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ with order dividing 6 (and >1) is $1+2+2=5$. Total combinations: $5^4 = 625$.\n12. Subtract combinations where the lcm is not 6.\n    -   lcm = 2: all orders must be 2. There is $1^4=1$ such combination.\n    -   lcm = 3: all orders must be 3. There are $2^4=16$ such combinations.\n13. Final count: $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nThe calculation appears correct. I am ready for the final answer.\nFinal check:\nIs it possible that for one of the primes, say $p=7$, $(p-1)$ was not divisible by 6? No, $7-1=6$, $13-1=12$, $19-1=18$, $31-1=30$. All are divisible by 6. So for each prime factor, there exist characters of order 2, 3, and 6.\n\nLet's do a small example. $d=21=3 \\times 7$.\nFind number of primitive characters of order 6.\n$\\chi = \\chi_3 \\chi_7$.\nord(lcm(ord($\\chi_3$), ord($\\chi_7$))) = 6.\n$\\chi_3$ must be non-principal, so ord($\\chi_3$) must divide $3-1=2$. ord($\\chi_3$) = 2. Number of such characters is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n$\\chi_7$ must be non-principal, so ord($\\chi_7$) must divide $7-1=6$. Possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\nlcm(ord($\\chi_3$), ord($\\chi_7$)) = lcm(2, ord($\\chi_7$)) = 6.\nThis requires ord($\\chi_7$) to be a multiple of 3. So ord($\\chi_7$) can be 3 or 6.\nNumber of characters mod 7 of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\nNumber of characters mod 7 of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\nTotal number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $2+2=4$.\nThe number of choices for $\\chi_3$ is 1.\nTotal number of primitive characters of order 6 mod 21 is $1 \\times 4 = 4$.\n\nLet's try my formula.\n$d = 3 \\times 7$.\n$p_1=3, p_2=7$.\n$p_1-1=2$. $p_2-1=6$.\nOrders for $\\chi_3$: {2}. ($n_3(2)=1$).\nOrders for $\\chi_7$: {2, 3, 6}. ($n_7(2)=1, n_7(3)=2, n_7(6)=2$).\n`lcm(o₃, o₇) = 6`. $o_3$ must be 2. So we need `lcm(2, o₇) = 6`.\nThis means $o_7$ must be divisible by 3. $o_7 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_3$ is $n_3(2)=1$.\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $n_7(3) + n_7(6) = 2+2=4$.\nTotal is $1 \\times 4 = 4$. Matches.\n\nOkay, let's re-apply the inclusion-exclusion to my main problem.\nLet $O_p = \\{o(\\chi_p)\\}$ be the multiset of orders of the non-principal characters mod $p$.\n$o_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n$V_p = (n_p(2), n_p(3), n_p(6)) = (1, 2, 2)$ for all $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\nTotal characters whose order divides 6 is $\\prod_p (n_p(2)+n_p(3)+n_p(6)) = 5^4 = 625$.\nNumber of characters whose order divides 3 is $\\prod_p n_p(3) = 2^4 = 16$.\nNumber of characters whose order divides 2 is $\\prod_p n_p(2) = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nLet $A$ be the set of characters whose order divides 6. $|A|=625$.\nLet $B$ be the set of characters whose order divides 3. $|B|=16$.\nLet $C$ be the set of characters whose order divides 2. $|C|=1$.\nThe set of characters of order 6 is $A \\setminus (B \\cup C)$.\nSince $B$ and $C$ are disjoint (a character cannot have order dividing 2 and 3, because lcm(2,3)=6, oh wait... an order can't be a divisor of 2 and a divisor of 3 simultaneously, unless it is 1. We excluded order 1 characters).\nSo the sets of characters are disjoint.\nThe set of characters of order dividing 3 are those where the orders of components $\\chi_p$ are all in {1, 3}. Since we need non-principal, orders must be in {3}.\nThe set of characters of order dividing 2 are those where the orders of components $\\chi_p$ are all in {1, 2}. Since we need non-principal, orders must be in {2}.\nThe lcm of a set of numbers from {3} is 3. The lcm of a set of numbers from {2} is 2.\nSo the number of characters of order 6 is indeed $|A| - |B| - |C| = 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nThe logic holds.\nThe final answer is an integer.\nNo more searching needed.\nThe breakdown is clear and the calculation is straightforward.\nFinal check of arithmetic:\n$5^4 = 625$.\n$2^4 = 16$.\n$1^4 = 1$.\n$625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\nSeems correct.To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Factorize the conductor d**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d=53599$.\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct odd primes, it is a square-free integer.\n\n**2. Properties of Primitive Characters**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character modulo the prime factor $p_i$.\n\nIn our case, a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo 53599 must be of the form $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a non-principal character modulo $p$.\n\n**3. Order of a Product Character**\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. This means we require:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n**4. Orders of Characters Modulo a Prime**\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic and has order $p-1$. The order of any character $\\chi_p$ must divide $p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ (where $k$ divides $p-1$) is given by $\\phi(k)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\nLet's examine the possible orders for the non-principal characters for each prime factor:\n*   **For p=7:** The group of characters has order $7-1=6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n*   **For p=13:** The group of characters has order $13-1=12$. Since 6 divides 12, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist.\n*   **For p=19:** The group of characters has order $19-1=18$. Since 6 divides 18, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist.\n*   **For p=31:** The group of characters has order $31-1=30$. Since 6 divides 30, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist.\n\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the order of each component character $\\chi_p$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal, its order cannot be 1. Therefore, the possible orders for each $\\chi_p$ are 2, 3, and 6.\n\nLet's calculate the number of characters for these orders:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four prime factors ($7, 13, 19, 31$), there are:\n*   1 character of order 2.\n*   2 characters of order 3.\n*   2 characters of order 6.\n\n**5. Counting the Combinations**\nLet $N$ be the number of primitive characters of order 6. We can find this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, we count the total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6. For each of the four prime factors, we can choose any non-principal character whose order divides 6. The number of such choices for each prime factor is the sum of the number of characters of order 2, 3, and 6.\nNumber of choices for each $\\chi_p$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are four prime factors, the total number of combinations of such characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis count includes characters where the lcm of the orders is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3. As the characters are non-principal, the order cannot be 1. We must subtract the cases where the order is 2 or 3.\n\n*   **Case 1: The lcm of the orders is 2.**\n    This occurs if and only if each $\\chi_p$ has an order that divides 2 (i.e., order 2, since order 1 is excluded). For each of the four primes, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n    The number of such combinations is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 2: The lcm of the orders is 3.**\n    This occurs if and only if each $\\chi_p$ has an order that divides 3 (i.e., order 3). For each of the four primes, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n    The number of such combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of characters whose order divides 6, minus those whose order divides 2, and minus those whose order divides 3.\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (Total characters with order dividing 6) - (Characters with order dividing 2) - (Characters with order dividing 3)\n$N = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
