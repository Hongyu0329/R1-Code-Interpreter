    "The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is **8**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at this result:\n\n### 1. Identify the Spaces\n*   **Domain:** Let's denote the domain space as $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^n$ is the based loop space on the n-sphere.\n    *   $\\wedge$ is the smash product.\n    *   $\\Sigma$ is the reduced suspension.\n*   **Codomain:** Let's denote the codomain space as $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   The smash product of spheres $S^m \\wedge S^n$ is homeomorphic to $S^{m+n}$.\n    *   Therefore, $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\cong S^{10}$.\n    *   So, the codomain is $B = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Connectivity of the Spaces\nThe connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Domain (A):**\n    1.  The connectivity of a loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$.\n        *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2) = 2$-connected.\n        *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2) = 4$-connected.\n    2.  For two connected CW-complexes $X$ and $Y$ that are $m$-connected and $n$-connected respectively, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(m+n+1)$-connected.\n        *   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$.\n    3.  The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected.\n        *   The space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is therefore $(7+1) = \\mathbf{8}$-connected.\n    4.  This means $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$. The first potentially non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(A)$. By the Hurewicz theorem and KÃ¼nneth formula, one can show that $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Codomain (B):**\n    1.  The connectivity of $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = \\mathbf{8}$.\n    2.  This means $\\pi_i(B) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$. The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(B) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Connectivity of the Map\nA map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be $n$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f): \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < n$ and an epimorphism (surjective) for $i = n$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of the map being $(n-1)$-connected.\n\nLet's examine the induced maps on homotopy groups for $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$:\n\n*   For $i < 8$: Both $\\pi_i(A)$ and $\\pi_i(B)$ are the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. The map between them is necessarily an isomorphism.\n*   For $i = 8$: Both $\\pi_8(A)$ and $\\pi_8(B)$ are also the trivial group. The map $\\pi_8(f)$ is again an isomorphism, which is also an epimorphism.\n*   According to the definition, since the map is an isomorphism for all $i < 9$ (which includes $i=8$), the map is at least 8-connected.\n\nTo determine if the map is 9-connected, we must check if $\\pi_9(f)$ is an epimorphism.\n\n*   For $i = 9$: The map on homotopy groups is $\\pi_9(f): \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$.\n    *   As determined above, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_9(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map is a homomorphism $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. Such a map is of the form $n \\mapsto kn$ for some integer $k$. This map is an epimorphism only if $k = \\pm 1$.\n*   The map in question is a version of the Samelson product or Whitehead product map. While this map is known to be an isomorphism after rationalization, it is a known result in homotopy theory that integrally, it is not an isomorphism. The integer $k$ is not equal to $\\pm 1$. This means the map is not an epimorphism on $\\pi_9$.\n\nSince the map on homotopy groups is an isomorphism for all $i \\le 8$, but is not an epimorphism for $i=9$, the connectivity of the map is exactly 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
