    "The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is largely determined by the identity and arrangement of amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat, which form the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing interface.\n\nTo determine the oligomeric state of the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern (`abcdefg`). The most plausible assignment that places hydrophobic residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions is as follows:\n\nHeptad: f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g\nSequence: G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G\n\nThis alignment reveals a consistent pattern at the hydrophobic core positions:\n*   **'a' positions**: Isoleucine (I)\n*   **'d' positions**: Leucine (L)\n\nBased on established principles from structural studies:\n*   The placement of Isoleucine (a β-branched amino acid) at the 'a' position and Leucine (a γ-branched amino acid) at the 'd' position is a classic arrangement that favors the formation of a parallel dimer. This specific packing is efficient and stable in a two-stranded coiled-coil. The GCN4 leucine zipper, a well-studied dimeric coiled-coil, features this Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' pattern.\n*   Conversely, reversing this arrangement, with Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd', typically leads to the formation of a tetramer.\n*   Trimer formation is often associated with a more even distribution of Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\nGiven that the provided sequence consistently places Isoleucine at the 'a' positions and Leucine at the 'd' positions, the most stable and likely oligomeric state is a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
