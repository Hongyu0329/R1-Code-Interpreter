    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we must first understand the composition of the molecule and the structure of the basis set.\n\n**1. Molecular Composition:**\n*   Toluene has 7 Carbon (C) atoms.\n*   Toluene has 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**2. Basis Set Definition (6-31G):**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. This means that core and valence electrons are treated differently.\n\n*   **For each non-hydrogen atom (like Carbon):**\n    *   **Core (1s) electrons:** Represented by a single contracted function, which is a sum of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Valence (2s, 2p) electrons:** These are split into two parts for flexibility.\n        *   An inner part described by one contracted function made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   An outer part described by one contracted function made from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n    *   For a carbon atom, we have a 1s orbital (core), a 2s orbital (valence), and three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz) (valence).\n    *   Calculation for Carbon:\n        *   1s orbital: 1 contracted function.\n        *   2s orbital: 2 contracted functions (inner and outer).\n        *   2p orbitals: Each of the three p-orbitals is split, contributing 2 functions each (2 * 3 = 6).\n        *   Total per Carbon atom = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n    *   **Valence (1s) electron:** It is split into two parts.\n        *   An inner part from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   An outer part from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Total per Hydrogen atom = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n**3. Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):**\n*   Total functions from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n*   Total functions from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n*   **Total contracted Gaussian functions** = 63 + 16 = **79**.\n\nFor a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\n<<<79>>>"
