    "To ensure a symmetric key is secure against an attack by an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, its length must be sufficient to withstand brute-force attacks that are quadratically accelerated by Grover's algorithm.\n\nQuantum computers pose a significant threat to symmetric key cryptography, primarily through the use of Grover's algorithm. This algorithm can search an unsorted database, such as the space of all possible cryptographic keys, with a square root speedup compared to classical computers. This effectively halves the bit length of the key's security.\n\nFor example, a symmetric key of 128 bits, which is considered secure against classical brute-force attacks (requiring 2¹²⁸ operations), would only offer 64 bits of security against a quantum computer running Grover's algorithm (requiring approximately 2⁶⁴ operations). A 64-bit security level is no longer considered safe.\n\nTo counteract this quantum threat and achieve a security level equivalent to 128 bits in a post-quantum world, the key length must be doubled. Therefore, a 256-bit symmetric key is the minimum length required to provide a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer. An attack on a 256-bit key would require roughly 2¹²⁸ operations, which is considered computationally infeasible for the foreseeable future, even for a powerful quantum computer.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has indicated that for its post-quantum cryptography standards, symmetric key algorithms like AES with 256-bit keys are considered quantum-resistant.\n\n<<<A>>>"
