The information provided in the prompt appears to be inaccurate. There is no evidence to suggest that Pavel Milyukov denounced any specific aspect of Western culture as a 'stagnant swamp'. While the term was used in Russian political discourse of the time to describe internal decay, it is not found in Milyukov's major speeches or writings in that context.
