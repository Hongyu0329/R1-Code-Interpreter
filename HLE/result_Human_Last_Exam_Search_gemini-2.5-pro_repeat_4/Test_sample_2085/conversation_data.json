    "The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is not a direct translation but can be understood through the etymological roots of its components. The name is composed of two Gaulish elements: \"Odo-\" and \"-beccus.\"\n\nThe second part of the name, **-beccus**, is well-attested in Gaulish and means \"beak.\" This word has survived into modern French as \"bec,\" also meaning \"beak.\"\n\nThe first element, **Odo-**, is likely derived from the Gaulish word **odocos**, which refers to the \"dwarf elder\" or \"danewort\" plant (*Sambucus ebulus*). This plant was known in the ancient Celtic world and had various uses.\n\nTherefore, the name \"Odobeccus\" can be interpreted as \"Elder Beak\" or \"Beak of the Elder.\"\n\nThere is no single, direct modern French given name that is a recognized equivalent of \"Odobeccus.\" However, one can construct a descriptive equivalent based on the meaning of its parts. A literal, though not common as a name, translation would be **\"Bec-de-Sureau\"** or **\"Bec-d'Hièble,\"** as \"sureau\" is the common French word for elder, and \"hièble\" is the specific term for the dwarf elder.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a historical figure, a general of the late Roman Empire, bore this name, sometimes recorded as \"Edobichus\" or \"Odobeccus.\" The variation in the name could suggest a Germanic influence, as \"Edo\" is also a Germanic name element. However, based on a purely Gaulish linguistic analysis, the \"Elder Beak\" interpretation is the most direct.\n\nWhile there are many French surnames derived from Gaulish words, a direct descendant of \"Odobeccus\" as a surname is not found. The legacy of Gaulish names in modern French is more often seen in place names.\n\n<<<Bec-de-Sureau>>>"
