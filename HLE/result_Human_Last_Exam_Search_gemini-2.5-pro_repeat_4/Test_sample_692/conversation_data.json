    "## The Americas' Oldest Inscribed Date: A Glimpse into Pre-Columbian Timekeeping\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is found on a cylinder seal from San Andrés, Tabasco, Mexico, associated with the Olmec civilization. Dated to approximately 650 BCE, the seal contains glyphs that have been interpreted as the day \"3 Ajaw\" in the 260-day sacred calendar. This artifact provides evidence for the use of a sophisticated calendrical system and a form of writing at a very early period in Mesoamerican history.\n\nWhile the San Andrés seal holds the distinction for the earliest calendrical notation, other significant early examples of recorded dates exist. At the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, a monument known as Monument 3, dating to between 600 and 500 BCE, bears a glyph that is interpreted as the day name \"1 Earthquake\" or \"1 Motion\". This carving, depicting a slain captive, is considered one of the earliest examples of writing in Mesoamerica and demonstrates the early use of the 260-day calendar for naming individuals or recording significant events.\n\nFor a specific historical date recorded in a continuous, linear count, the earliest known example comes from the Epi-Olmec culture. The Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, found in Chiapas, Mexico, is inscribed with a Long Count date of 7.16.3.2.13, which correlates to December 36 BCE. This monument is widely recognized for bearing the oldest confirmed Long Count date, a calendrical system that would later be famously used by the Maya civilization. Another significant early Long Count date is found on Tres Zapotes Stela C, which dates to 32 BCE.\n\nThe question of the \"earliest date\" can therefore be answered in two ways. The glyphs on the San Andrés cylinder seal and the San José Mogote monument represent the earliest known records of a specific day within the recurring 260-day calendar. However, the Chiapa de Corzo stela holds the record for the earliest known inscription of a specific date within a linear, historical timeline.\n\nIt is important to note that the interpretation of the earliest glyphs, such as those on the San Andrés seal, is a subject of ongoing scholarly discussion. Furthermore, the Cascajal Block, also from the Olmec heartland and dated to around 900 BCE, is considered by many to be the oldest example of writing in the Americas, though it does not contain any discernible date.\n\n<<<The glyph for the day \"3 Ajaw\" on the San Andrés cylinder seal, dated to c. 650 BCE.>>>"
