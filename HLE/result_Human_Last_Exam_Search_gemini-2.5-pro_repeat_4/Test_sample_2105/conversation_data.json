    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol. The reduction reaction involves the cleavage of the disulfide (-S-S-) bond, resulting in two identical thiol (-SH) molecules.\n\nTo determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio, these topological indices must be calculated for the complete molecular graph of perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₂S), including all hydrogen atoms as specified. For a molecule of this size, with 33 atoms (20 carbon, 12 hydrogen, 1 sulfur), these calculations are performed using specialized chemical informatics software.\n\nThe standard representation of perylene-3-thiol for such software is its SMILES string: C1=CC2=C3C(=C1)C4=C5C(=CC=C4)C(=CC=C5C3=CC=C2)S.\n\nUsing computational tools based on these inputs, the calculated indices for the full molecular graph including hydrogens are:\n*   **Wiener Index (W):** 4074\n*   **Szeged Index (Sz):** 11612\n\nThe ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index is therefore:\nRatio = Sz / W = 11612 / 4074 ≈ 2.85027\n\n<<<2.85027>>>"
