    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction Type**: The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), is a strong, sterically bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Starting Material**: The (1S,2R) designation indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other. In cyclohexane rings, trans-1,2-substituents can be either both in equatorial positions (diequatorial) or both in axial positions (diaxial). The diequatorial conformation is significantly more stable because it minimizes steric strain. Therefore, the most stable and abundant conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane has both the bromine and the methyl group in equatorial positions.\n\n3.  **The E2 Mechanism Requirement**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (in this case, Br) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions.\n\n4.  **Conformational Change for Reaction**: The most stable diequatorial conformer of the starting material cannot undergo E2 elimination because the equatorial bromine is not anti-periplanar to any β-hydrogens. For the reaction to proceed, the cyclohexane ring must flip to its less stable diaxial conformation. In this conformation, both the bromine atom (at C1) and the methyl group (at C2) are in axial positions. Although this conformation is less stable, it is the only one that can undergo the E2 reaction.\n\n5.  **Identification of the Abstracted Proton**: In the reactive diaxial conformation, we must identify the available axial β-hydrogens.\n    *   **At Carbon 2 (C2)**: The methyl group is in the axial position, which means the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. Since there is no axial hydrogen on C2, elimination cannot occur towards this carbon to form 1-methylcyclohexene.\n    *   **At Carbon 6 (C6)**: This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n\n6.  **Formation of the Product**: The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, will abstract the only available anti-periplanar proton, which is the axial hydrogen on C6. Simultaneously, the C-H bond electrons form a double bond between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion departs. This stereoelectronic requirement dictates that the elimination forms a double bond between carbons 1 and 6, resulting in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**. This outcome demonstrates that the stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction can override Zaitsev's rule, which would have predicted the formation of the more substituted (and generally more stable) alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
