    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ above 2 has 2 double points.\n\nThis is determined by analyzing the structure of the curve's stable model over the 2-adic numbers. The original curve has a genus of 2, calculated as $g = \\lfloor(\\text{degree}-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$. When a curve is reduced modulo a prime, its geometric properties can change. In this case, the reduction is \"bad,\" meaning the special fiber of any straightforward model is singular.\n\nThe theory of stable reduction, developed by Deligne and Mumford, describes a canonical way to find a \"stable model\" for the curve, whose special fiber is a stable curve. A stable curve is one with at most ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities.\n\nFor a curve of genus $g \\ge 2$, the arithmetic genus of its stable reduction is equal to $g$. If the stable reduction is an irreducible curve, its arithmetic genus is the sum of its geometric genus and the number of its double points ($\\delta$). In this case, analysis of the 2-adic valuations of the branch points of the hyperelliptic curve suggests that the stable reduction is irreducible. The components of the special fiber of the minimal regular model are rational curves (geometric genus 0). Therefore, for the arithmetic genus to be 2, the stable reduction must be a rational curve with a certain number of nodes.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula $g = g_{geom} + \\delta$, where $g$ is the arithmetic genus (2), $g_{geom}$ is the geometric genus of the irreducible component (0 for a rational curve), and $\\delta$ is the number of double points. Plugging in the values, we get $2 = 0 + \\delta$, which implies that the stable reduction has 2 double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
