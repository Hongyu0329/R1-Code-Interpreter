    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe order of a point group refers to the number of symmetry operations it contains. A point group of order 2 can be one of two types:\n*   **C₂**: This group contains an identity operation and a single 180-degree rotation.\n*   **D₁**: This group contains an identity operation and a single reflection.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups can be classified by their associated point groups. The wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C₂. Its symmetries include 180-degree rotations, but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group has a point group of D₁. It has parallel reflection axes and no rotations.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a point group of D₁. It contains only glide reflections with parallel axes and no rotations or reflections.\n*   **cm**: This group's point group is D₁. It features reflections and glide-reflections along parallel axes.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of four wallpaper groups (p2, pm, pg, and cm) that have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
