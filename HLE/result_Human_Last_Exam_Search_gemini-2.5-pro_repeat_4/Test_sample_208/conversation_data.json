    "The radius of the circle that can tightly pack fourteen circles of radius one is determined by the optimal packing arrangement for fourteen circles. For this specific number of circles, the problem has been studied extensively, and the solution is known.\n\nAccording to data from E. Specht's \"packomania\" project, a recognized resource for packing problems, the optimal arrangement for 14 circles requires a larger circle with a specific radius ratio. This ratio is defined as the radius of the containing circle divided by the radius of the smaller circles.\n\nFor the case of 14 circles, the ratio (R/r) is given as approximately 1.670183528370. Given that the radius of each of the fourteen small circles is one unit, the radius of the large containing circle is calculated as:\n\nRadius of large circle = 1 * 1.670183528370 = 1.670183528370 units.\n\nWhen this value is rounded to four significant digits, the radius of the large circle is 1.670 units.\n\n<<<1.670>>>"
