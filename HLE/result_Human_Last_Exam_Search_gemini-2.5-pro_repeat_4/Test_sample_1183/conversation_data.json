    "The provided SMILES string, `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`, describes a derivative of a triangulene molecule. Triangulenes are planar, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with a distinctive triangular shape. This particular molecule is substituted with three ethynyl (`-C≡CH`) groups at its vertices.\n\nTo determine the symmetry point group, we analyze the molecule's geometric shape and the symmetry operations that can be performed on it while leaving it indistinguishable from its original orientation.\n\n1.  **Structure and Shape**: The core of the molecule is a large, flat polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The three ethynyl groups are placed symmetrically, one at each \"corner\" of the triangle. This arrangement preserves the overall trigonal planar geometry of the parent triangulene molecule. Molecules with this ideal trigonal planar shape, where three identical ligands are attached to a central point, belong to the D3h point group.\n\n2.  **Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   **Principal Axis (C₃)**: There is a three-fold rotational axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Perpendicular C₂ Axes**: There are three two-fold rotational axes lying in the plane of the molecule. Each axis passes through the center and one of the molecular corners (through the ethynyl group). The presence of these C₂ axes perpendicular to the principal C₃ axis indicates a 'D' point group classification.\n    *   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σh)**: The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane. Since all atoms lie within this plane, reflecting through it leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\nThe combination of a principal C₃ axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) uniquely defines the **D₃h** point group.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
