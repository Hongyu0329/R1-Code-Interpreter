    "There is no readily available direct answer for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This is a specific variation of the n-queens problem for which published results or established formulas are not easily found.\n\nHowever, a solution exists for a closely related problem: placing non-attacking *semi-queens* on a toroidal board. A semi-queen has the same moves as a rook and a bishop, but only on the main diagonals, not the anti-diagonals. For a queen, attacks are also along the anti-diagonals. This means that any valid arrangement of 4 non-attacking queens would also be a valid arrangement for 4 non-attacking semi-queens, but the reverse is not necessarily true.\n\nFor the semi-queen problem, the number of ways to place *k* non-attacking semi-queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is given by the sequence T(n,k) in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A342372.\n\nThe values for a 5x5 board (n=5) are listed as:\n*   T(5,0) = 1\n*   T(5,1) = 25\n*   T(5,2) = 150\n*   T(5,3) = 250\n*   T(5,4) = 75\n*   T(5,5) = 15\n\nTherefore, there are 75 ways to place 4 non-attacking **semi-queens** on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nThe number of ways to place 4 non-attacking **queens** on the same board would be less than or equal to this number, as some of the semi-queen arrangements may have attacks along the anti-diagonals, which are not permitted for queens. Without a specific formula or computational result for queens, a more precise answer cannot be provided at this time.\n\n<<<75>>>"
