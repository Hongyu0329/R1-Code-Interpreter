    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ can be determined using a general formula for connected reductive groups.\n\nFirst, a reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is necessarily split. This is because the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that there are no twisted forms of $E_8$ over a finite field. Furthermore, the algebraic group of type $E_8$ is both simply connected and of adjoint type, meaning its center is trivial.\n\nFor a connected reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by a formula established by R. Steinberg. The number is the ratio of the order of the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the corresponding adjoint group, $G_{ad}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, to the order of the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of a maximally split torus within it, $T_{ad,s}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\nSince the group $G$ of type $E_8$ is its own adjoint group, the formula simplifies to:\nNumber of tori = $\\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_s(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}$\nwhere $T_s$ is a split maximal torus of $G$.\n\nThe order of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ of type $E_8$ is given by the Chevalley-Steinberg formula:\n$|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1) (q^8-1) (q^{12}-1) (q^{14}-1) (q^{18}-1) (q^{20}-1) (q^{24}-1) (q^{30}-1)$\nThe numbers in the exponents are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, and the exponent 120 is the number of positive roots in the $E_8$ root system.\n\nA split maximal torus $T_s$ of rank 8 over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to the direct product of 8 copies of the multiplicative group of the field, $(\\mathbb{F}_q^*)^8$. Therefore, the number of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points is:\n$|T_s(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8$\n\nCombining these, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is:\n$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1) (q^8-1) (q^{12}-1) (q^{14}-1) (q^{18}-1) (q^{20}-1) (q^{24}-1) (q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\nThis expression can also be written as a product:\n$$ q^{120} \\left(\\frac{q^2-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^8-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{12}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{14}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{18}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{20}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{24}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{30}-1}{q-1}\\right) $$\nEach term $\\frac{q^d-1}{q-1}$ is the polynomial $1+q+q^2+\\dots+q^{d-1}$.\n\nThus, the final exact number is given by the formula:\n$$ q^{120} \\prod_{d \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}} \\frac{q^d-1}{q-1} $$\n\n<<<The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1) (q^8-1) (q^{12}-1) (q^{14}-1) (q^{18}-1) (q^{20}-1) (q^{24}-1) (q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$ q^{120} \\prod_{d \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}} (1+q+q^2+\\dots+q^{d-1}) $$"
