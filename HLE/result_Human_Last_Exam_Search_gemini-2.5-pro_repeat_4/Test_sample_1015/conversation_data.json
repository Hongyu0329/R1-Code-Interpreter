    "The fundamental difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. This distinction is rooted in the core principles of each ballet technique.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso, with the hips and shoulders aligned. When executing a cambré derrière, the Vaganova-trained dancer strives to keep the hips still and directly over the supporting legs, with the backbend initiated from the upper and middle spine. This creates a sense of controlled, elegant line and stability, with the upper body moving independently from the lower body.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for its dynamic and more open use of the upper body, often breaking the strict lines of classical ballet to achieve greater speed and the illusion of longer limbs. A key characteristic of the Balanchine style is the open hip, most famously seen in the arabesque, which allows for a higher extension of the leg. This principle extends to other movements, including the cambré derrière. Balanchine's choreography can feature hips sweeping forward, allowing for a more extreme and dramatic backbend. This freedom in the hips creates a different aesthetic, emphasizing speed, line, and a more \"neoclassical\" look.\n\nWhile other elements like arm placement (port de bras), head placement, and speed can differ between the two methods, the foundational difference in the treatment of the hips during a backbend like the cambré derrière is the most significant and defining distinction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
