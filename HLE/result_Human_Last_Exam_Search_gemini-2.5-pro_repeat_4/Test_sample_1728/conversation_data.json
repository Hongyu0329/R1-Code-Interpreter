    "Let \\(G\\) be a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\). We want to find the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\).\n\nFirst, it is crucial to define the \"sum\" of graphs. In graph theory, the sum of graphs can have different meanings. Two common interpretations are:\n1.  **Union of graphs on the same vertex set:** In this case, the graph \\(G\\) would have \\(n\\) vertices, and its edge set would be the union of the edge sets of the three cycles.\n2.  **Join of graphs:** The join of two graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\), denoted as \\(G_1 + G_2\\), is formed by taking the disjoint union of the vertices of \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) and adding all possible edges between the vertices of \\(G_1\\) and the vertices of \\(G_2\\). This notation is commonly used in graph theory literature when discussing chromatic numbers.\n\nLet's analyze the chromatic number under both interpretations to determine the maximal value.\n\n### Interpretation 1: Union of Edges on a Common Vertex Set\n\nLet the three cycles be \\(C_n^1\\), \\(C_n^2\\), and \\(C_n^3\\), all on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices. The graph \\(G\\) is the union of these three cycles. The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is 2. Therefore, the maximum degree \\(\\Delta(G)\\) of any vertex in \\(G\\) is at most \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is at most its maximum degree \\(\\Delta(G)\\). In our case, \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), so \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6\\) unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Since the maximum degree can be up to 6, \\(G\\) is not an odd cycle (which has a maximum degree of 2).\n\nHowever, it is possible for the union of three cycles to form a complete graph \\(K_n\\). For a graph on \\(n\\) vertices to be a complete graph, the number of edges must be \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\). The total number of edges in the sum of three cycles is at most \\(3n\\).\nFor \\(G\\) to be \\(K_n\\), we must have \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 3n\\), which simplifies to \\(n-1 \\le 6\\), or \\(n \\le 7\\).\n\n*   For \\(n=7\\), the complete graph \\(K_7\\) has \\(\\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\) edges. The sum of three \\(C_7\\) cycles has at most \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges. It is a known result that the edges of \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles (which are \\(C_7\\)). Thus, the sum of three specific \\(C_7\\) cycles can form \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is 7.\n*   For \\(n > 7\\), the number of edges in \\(K_n\\) is greater than \\(3n\\), so the sum of three \\(C_n\\) cycles cannot form a complete graph. In this case, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nTherefore, under this interpretation, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Join of Graphs\n\nThis interpretation assumes the \"sum\" refers to the join operation, a common usage for the '+' symbol in chromatic graph theory literature. Let the three cycles be \\(C_n^1\\), \\(C_n^2\\), and \\(C_n^3\\), with disjoint vertex sets. The graph \\(G\\) is the join \\(C_n^1 + C_n^2 + C_n^3\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of the join of two disjoint graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) is given by \\(\\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2)\\). This rule extends to the join of three graphs:\n\\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^1) + \\chi(C_n^2) + \\chi(C_n^3)\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph \\(C_n\\) depends on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd:\n*   \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\) if \\(n\\) is even.\n*   \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\) if \\(n\\) is odd.\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\), we need to maximize the chromatic number of each individual cycle. The maximum chromatic number for a cycle is 3, which occurs when \\(n\\) is an odd number (e.g., \\(n=3, 5, 7, \\dots\\)).\n\nThus, the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is:\n\\(\\chi_{max}(G) = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the two interpretations, the join of three odd cycles yields a chromatic number of 9, while the union of three cycles on the same vertex set gives a maximum chromatic number of 7. The phrase \"maximal chromatic number\" suggests we should consider the scenario that produces the highest possible value. Given that the join operation is a standard interpretation of the sum of graphs in this context and leads to a higher value, it is the most likely intended meaning.\n\n<<<9>>>"
