    "To determine the central pixel of a line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, the following steps are taken:\n\nFirst, calculate the change in x and y:\n*   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nSince Δx is greater than Δy, the x-coordinate will be incremented in each step, and the y-coordinate will be incremented only when the decision parameter is non-negative.\n\nThe initial decision parameter is calculated as:\n*   p = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\nThe algorithm starts at the first endpoint (1,1) and iteratively determines the next pixel. The sequence of pixels generated is as follows:\n\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   (6, 3)\n*   (7, 3)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 4)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThis sequence consists of 11 pixels. The central pixel is the 6th one in this sequence.\n\n<<<The coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).>>>"
