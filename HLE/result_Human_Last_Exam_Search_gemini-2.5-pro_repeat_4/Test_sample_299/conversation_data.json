    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound for the cardinality of the set of solutions. There are constructions for solutions to this functional equation that demonstrate a high degree of freedom in choosing the function. One such construction involves the following steps:\n1.  Choose any real number $a < 0$.\n2.  Define a function $f_0: (-\\infty, a] \\to (a, 0]$ that is continuous, strictly increasing, and surjective (meaning it covers the entire interval $(a, 0]$).\n3.  This initial function $f_0$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ for all real numbers $x$.\n\nThe crucial point is the freedom to choose the initial function $f_0$. The set of continuous functions from one interval to another has the cardinality of the continuum, $c$. Since each distinct choice of $f_0$ leads to a unique solution for $f$, there must be at least $c$ such solutions.\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound. The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has a cardinality of $c$. This can be shown by recognizing that a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, such as the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, the set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = c^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c$. The set of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is a subset of this, and as we have seen, it contains at least $c$ functions (the constant functions, for example). Thus, its cardinality is exactly $c$.\n\nThe set of solutions to $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, its cardinality can be at most $c$.\n\nSince the cardinality of the set of solutions is both at least $c$ and at most $c$, by the Cantor-SchrÃ¶der-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality is exactly $c$. The cardinality of the continuum, $c$, is equal to $2^{\\aleph_0}$, which is the size of the set of real numbers.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum (c)>>>"
