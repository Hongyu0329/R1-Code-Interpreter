    "The haiku, titled \"The Bays,\" is a riddle that points to a significant historical event. An analysis of its lines reveals a detailed description of the end of World War II in the Pacific.\n\nThe line \"An August tempest\" refers to the tumultuous end of the war in August 1945. \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" pinpoints a specific date: August 30th. On this day, General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan, heralding the start of the Allied occupation and a period of profound transformation for the country. The final line, \"A divine one yields,\" is a clear reference to Emperor Hirohito of Japan, who was considered a divine figure by his people and who announced Japan's surrender to the Allied forces on August 15, 1945.\n\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" serves as the central question. The answer lies in identifying the key naval bays that are historically significant to the beginning and end of the Pacific War for the United States. These are:\n\n*   **Pearl Harbor:** The attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, was the catalyst for the United States' entry into World War II. The USS Missouri, the very ship aboard which the surrender was signed, is now a museum ship moored in Pearl Harbor, near the USS Arizona Memorial, symbolizing the full circle of the conflict.\n\n*   **Sagami Bay:** In the final days of the war, the Allied fleet, including the USS Missouri, anchored in Sagami Bay before proceeding to Tokyo for the formal surrender ceremony.\n\n*   **Tokyo Bay:** The formal signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender took place on the deck of the USS Missouri while it was anchored in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945, officially ending World War II.\n\nThus, the answer to the question posed by the title, in alphabetical order, is:\n\n<<<Pearl Harbor, Sagami Bay, Tokyo Bay>>>"
