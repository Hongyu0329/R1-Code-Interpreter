    "The minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of the 4-sphere over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is one. This conclusion is reached through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the topological space:** The space in question is the 2-fold branched cover of the 4-sphere, S⁴, where the branching occurs over a specific embedded 2-sphere known as the 5-twist-spun trefoil. Let's denote this resulting 4-manifold as X₅.\n\n2.  **Apply the relevant formula:** The fundamental group of such a space, π₁(Xₙ), can be determined using a formula derived from the work of several topologists. For an n-twist-spun knot created from a classical knot K, the fundamental group of its double branched cover is given by the quotient group G / N.\n    *   G is the fundamental group of the double branched cover of the 3-sphere (S³) over the original knot K.\n    *   N is the normal subgroup generated by the relation hⁿ = t(h)ⁿ, where h is an element in G representing a meridian of the knot K, and t is a specific automorphism on G.\n\n3.  **Determine the components for the trefoil knot:**\n    *   **The knot K:** In this case, K is the trefoil knot, which is also known as the (2,3)-torus knot.\n    *   **The group G:** The double branched cover of S³ over the trefoil knot is the lens space L(3,1). The fundamental group of L(3,1) is the cyclic group of order 3, denoted Z₃. So, G = Z₃.\n    *   **The meridian h:** In G = Z₃, the meridian h corresponds to a generator of the group.\n    *   **The automorphism t:** For a (p,q)-torus knot, the relevant automorphism t on the fundamental group of the branched cover (which is Zₚ) is given by multiplication by q². For the trefoil knot T(2,3), we have p=3 and q=2. The automorphism t on G = Z₃ is therefore multiplication by 2² = 4. Since the group is modulo 3, multiplication by 4 is equivalent to multiplication by 1 (4 ≡ 1 mod 3). This means t is the identity automorphism; it leaves every element unchanged.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final group:**\n    *   The twisting number is n=5.\n    *   The relation defining the normal subgroup N is h⁵ = t(h)⁵.\n    *   Since t is the identity map (t(h) = h), the relation becomes h⁵ = h⁵.\n    *   This is a trivial relation that provides no new constraints on the group G. Therefore, the normal subgroup N is trivial.\n    *   The fundamental group is π₁(X₅) = G / N = Z₃ / {1} = Z₃.\n\n5.  **Find the minimal number of generators:** The resulting fundamental group is Z₃, the cyclic group of order 3. A cyclic group (with order greater than 1) is, by definition, generated by a single element.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of generators for this fundamental group is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
