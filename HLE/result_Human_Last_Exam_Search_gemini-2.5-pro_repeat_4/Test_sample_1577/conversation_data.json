    "The ground state degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the number of logical qubits the code can store, which in turn depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. The degeneracy is given by the formula 2^k, where *k* is the number of logical qubits.\n\nLet's analyze the topology of a surface with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes. The number of logical qubits, *k*, corresponds to the number of independent pairs of logical X and Z operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but not necessarily with each other.\n\nThe problem can be analyzed by considering the number of independent, non-trivial loop operators (or string operators connecting boundaries). The key distinction between the boundary types is which kind of excitation can terminate (or \"condense\") on them:\n*   **Smooth boundary:** Allows 'm' (plaquette) anyons to terminate. This means string-like logical X operators are trivialized at these boundaries. However, logical Z operators (Z-loops) are well-defined.\n*   **Rough boundary:** Allows 'e' (vertex) anyons to terminate. This means string-like logical Z operators are trivialized, but logical X operators (X-loops) are well-defined.\n\nLet's count the number of logical qubits, assuming the toric code is laid out on an infinite plane with *n* and *m* holes punched out. On an infinite plane, there is no overarching topological constraint that relates the loops around all the holes (unlike on a sphere, where the product of all loops is trivial).\n\n1.  **For each of the *n* smooth holes:**\n    *   We can define a logical Z operator (Lz) as a non-contractible loop of ﾏホ operators encircling the hole.\n    *   We can define a corresponding logical X operator (Lx) as a string of ﾏベ operators running from the hole to infinity.\n    *   This pair (Lz, Lx) forms a valid logical qubit. Since there are *n* such holes, and on an infinite plane they are all independent, this gives us *n* logical qubits.\n\n2.  **For each of the *m* rough holes:**\n    *   We can define a logical X operator (Lx) as a non-contractible loop of ﾏベ operators encircling the hole.\n    *   The corresponding logical Z operator (Lz) is a string of ﾏホ operators running from the hole to infinity.\n    *   This pair (Lz, Lx) forms another valid logical qubit. With *m* rough holes, we get *m* additional logical qubits.\n\nCombining these, the total number of logical qubits *k* is the sum of the qubits from the smooth holes and the qubits from the rough holes:\nk = n + m\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is therefore 2^k, which is 2^(n+m).\n\nThis result matches one of the provided answer choices. If the system were on a compact sphere, the result would be 2^(n+m-1), which is not an option. Thus, the context implies an infinite planar geometry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
