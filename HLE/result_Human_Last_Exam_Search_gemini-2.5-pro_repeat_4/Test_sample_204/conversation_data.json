    "The Hopf charge, also known as the Hopf index, of the given vector field is 1.\n\nThis result can be determined by understanding the topological structure of the field and applying the concept of the linking number, which is fundamental to the definition of the Hopf invariant.\n\n### Vector Field Analysis\nThe vector field is defined as:\n*   **n** = (nx, ny, nz)\n*   nx = sin(G)cos(f)\n*   ny = sin(G)sin(f)\n*   nz = cos(G)\n\nHere, `f` represents the azimuthal angle `atan2(y,x)`, and `G` is a function that depends on the distance `r2` from a central circle defined by `x² + y² = 0.5` in the `z=0` plane.\n*   At infinity, the distance `r2` is infinite, causing `G` to approach 0. This makes the vector field **n** point uniformly towards the north pole (0, 0, 1). This condition is necessary for a well-defined Hopf charge.\n*   On the central circle (`x² + y² = 0.5`, `z=0`), the distance `r2` is zero, making `G = π`. On this circle, the vector field **n** points to the south pole (0, 0, -1).\n\n### Topological Interpretation\n\nThe Hopf charge is an integer that classifies how the 3D space is \"wrapped\" onto the surface of a sphere by the vector field. It belongs to the third homotopy group of the 2-sphere, π₃(S²), which is the set of integers **Z**. The charge can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the sphere.\n\n1.  **Preimage of the South Pole**: The set of all points in the 3D space that map to the south pole `(0, 0, -1)` is the circle `x² + y² = 0.5, z=0`. Let's call this loop C₁.\n\n2.  **Preimage of a Generic Point**: Let's consider the preimage of a generic point on the equator of the sphere, for example, `(1, 0, 0)`. This requires `G = π/2` and `f = 0`. The condition `f=0` restricts the preimage to the half-plane where `y=0` and `x>0`. The condition `G=π/2` defines a specific closed loop within this half-plane. Let's call this loop C₂.\n\n3.  **Linking Number**: The loop C₂ is a closed curve in the `y=0` plane that encircles the point `(x=√0.5, z=0)`. The loop C₁ (the preimage of the south pole) pierces this plane precisely at that point. Therefore, the loop C₂ links the loop C₁ exactly once.\n\nAccording to the definition of the Hopf invariant, this linking number is the Hopf charge.\n\nFurthermore, for axisymmetric fields of this type, the Hopf charge `H` is often calculated as the product of two winding numbers, `H = k * m`.\n*   `k` is the azimuthal winding number. Since the field's angle `f` makes one full rotation for each rotation around the z-axis, `k=1`.\n*   `m` is the poloidal winding number, which describes how many times the polar angle `G` sweeps from 0 to π. In this case, `G` covers the range from 0 (at infinity) to π (at the central circle), so `m=1`.\n\nThus, the total Hopf charge is H = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
