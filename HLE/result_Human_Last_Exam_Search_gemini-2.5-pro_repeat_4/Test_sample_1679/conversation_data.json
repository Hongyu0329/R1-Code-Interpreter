    "**\"An American in Paris,\" the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film in that category to feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk.** The iconic Parisian landmark is showcased during the film's celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence.\n\nWhile much of the movie was filmed on elaborate sets in Hollywood, these were meticulously crafted to recreate the French capital. A significant portion of the final ballet, a dream sequence, is set in a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde, the actual location of the Luxor Obelisk in Paris.\n\nIn the film, Gene Kelly's character, Jerry Mulligan, dances around a fountain in a set designed to evoke the Place de la Concorde. The art direction for this sequence was inspired by the work of French painter Raoul Dufy, and his impressionistic take on the famous public square. Although a recreation, the distinctive silhouette of the Luxor Obelisk is visible in the background of these scenes.\n\nEarlier Best Picture winners set in Paris, such as \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937), do not feature the Place de la Concorde. Later winners, like \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956), which also included Parisian scenes, primarily used studio sets for different locations within the city and did not depict the obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
