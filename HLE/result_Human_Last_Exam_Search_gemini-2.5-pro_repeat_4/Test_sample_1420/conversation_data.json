    "In the framework of the renormalization group, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat is determined using the epsilon expansion by calculating it as a power series in ϵ = d_c - d, where d_c is the upper critical dimension and d is the spatial dimension.\n\nFor a large class of universality models (like the Ising, XY, or Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. The problem specifies a spatial dimension of d=3, which means ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nThe epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α depends on the number of components, 'n', of the order parameter (spin dimension). The general formula to the first order in ϵ for an O(n) model is:\n\nα = (4 - n)ϵ / (2(n + 8)) + O(ϵ²)\n\nGiven that ϵ = 1, the value of α depends on 'n':\n*   **For the Ising model (n=1):** This model describes systems with a single-component order parameter, like a liquid-gas critical point or a uniaxial magnet. The exponent α is calculated as:\n    α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) = 3 / 18 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167.\n*   **For the XY model (n=2):** This model applies to systems with a two-component order parameter, such as the superfluid transition in Helium-4. The calculation gives:\n    α = (4 - 2) / (2 * (2 + 8)) = 2 / 20 = 0.1.\n*   **For the Heisenberg model (n=3):** This model describes isotropic magnets with a three-component spin. The exponent is:\n    α = (4 - 3) / (2 * (3 + 8)) = 1 / 22 ≈ 0.045.\n\nIt is important to note that using the epsilon expansion with ϵ=1 is a first-order approximation. More precise theoretical values, often derived from higher-order calculations or numerical methods like Monte Carlo simulations, can differ. For instance, experimental results for the lambda transition of superfluid helium (n=2) find α to be approximately -0.0127. Similarly, experimental values for systems in the Ising class (n=1, d=3) are around 0.110.\n\nHowever, based on the first-order epsilon expansion requested, the value depends on the specific system's universality class (n). Assuming the common case of the Ising model (n=1):\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
