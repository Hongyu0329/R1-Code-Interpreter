    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow a systematic procedure. The core of this method lies in the principle of duality, which connects the observability of a system `(A, C)` to the controllability of its dual system `(A^T, C^T)`.\n\n**1. Define the Original System and its Dual**\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe dual system, which is a control system, is defined by the transposes of these matrices. Let's denote the state-space matrices of the dual system as `(A_d, B_d)`:\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n**2. Transformation to Canonical Form**\n\nThe process involves finding a state transformation for the original system, `z(k) = T x(k)`, that brings it into observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)`.\n`A_o = T A T^{-1}`\n`C_o = C T^{-1}`\n\nThe duality principle states that the observer canonical form of the original system corresponds to the controller canonical form of the dual system. Specifically, `A_o = A_{cc}^T` and `C_o = B_{cc}^T`, where `(A_{cc}, B_{cc})` are the matrices of the dual system in controller canonical form.\n\nA direct method to find the transformation matrix `T` is to construct it from linearly independent rows of the observability matrix `O` of the original system.\n\n**3. Constructing the Transformation Matrix**\n\nFirst, we determine the observability indices by selecting linearly independent rows from the observability matrix `O = [C^T; (CA)^T; (CA^2)^T]^T`. The standard procedure is to check the rows in sequence: `c_1^T, c_2^T, c_1^T A, c_2^T A, ...`, where `c_1^T` and `c_2^T` are the rows of `C`.\n\n*   `c_1^T = [0, 1, 0]`\n*   `c_2^T = [1, 1, 0]`\n*   `c_1^T A = [0, 1, 0] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [2, 1, 1]`\n\nThese three vectors are linearly independent, which can be verified by checking the determinant of the matrix formed by them: `det([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]) = -1`. Since we have found 3 linearly independent vectors, we can stop.\n\nThis selection defines the observability indices as `ν₁=2` (since we used `c_1^T` and `c_1^T A`) and `ν₂=1` (since we used `c_2^T`). The new state variables `z(k)` for the canonical form are defined based on these vector chains:\n*   `z₁(k) = c_1^T x(k) = y₁(k)`\n*   `z₂(k) = c_1^T A x(k) = y₁(k+1)`\n*   `z₃(k) = c_2^T x(k) = y₂(k)`\n\nThis defines the transformation matrix `T` as:\n`T = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\n**4. Calculating the New C Matrix (`C_o`)**\n\nThe new output matrix `C_o` is given by `C_o = C T⁻¹`. First, we need to compute the inverse of `T`.\n\nThe inverse `T⁻¹` is calculated as:\n`T⁻¹ = [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\n\nNow, we can find the new matrix `C_o`:\n`C_o = C T⁻¹ = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThis resulting matrix `C_o` has a characteristic sparse structure for observer canonical forms of multi-output systems. The first row `[1, 0, 0]` indicates that the first output `y₁` is equal to the first new state variable `z₁`. The second row `[0, 0, 1]` indicates that the second output `y₂` is equal to the third new state variable `z₃`. This aligns perfectly with how the new state variables were defined.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
