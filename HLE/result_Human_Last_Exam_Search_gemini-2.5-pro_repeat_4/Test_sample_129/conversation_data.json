    "Answering this question requires a careful and systematic enumeration of all possible valid boolean expressions of exactly five symbols that evaluate to true. The symbols available are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`. The operator precedence is `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\nWe can categorize all possible 5-symbol expressions by their main structure. An expression can be enclosed in parentheses, like `(E)`, or be an application of a unary or binary operator.\n\nHere is a systematic breakdown of the true expressions:\n\n### Category 1: Expressions enclosed in parentheses `(E)`\nFor an expression `(E)` to have 5 symbols, the inner expression `E` must have exactly 3 symbols. For `(E)` to be true, `E` must evaluate to true.\n\nThe true expressions of length 3 are:\n*   `!!T` (which evaluates to `!F`, then `T`)\n*   `T&T`\n*   `T|T`\n*   `T|F`\n*   `F|T`\n*   `(T)` (evaluates to T)\n\nThis gives us 6 expressions in this category: `(!!T)`, `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, and `((T))`.\n\n### Category 2: Expressions of the form `!(E)`\nFor an expression `!(E)` to have 5 symbols, the inner expression `E` must have 3 symbols. For `!(E)` to be true, `E` must evaluate to false.\n\nThe false expressions of length 3 are:\n*   `!!F` (evaluates to `!T`, then `F`)\n*   `T&F`\n*   `F&T`\n*   `F&F`\n*   `F|F`\n*   `(F)` (evaluates to F)\n\nThis gives us another 6 expressions: `!(!!F)`, `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`, `!(F|F)`, and `!((F))`.\n\n### Category 3: Expressions with a leading unary operator `!`\nThese are expressions that are not fully enclosed in parentheses and start with one or more `!` symbols.\n*   `!!!!T`: This evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n*   `!!(!T)`: This evaluates to `!!(F)`, which is `T`. (1 expression)\n*   `!(!(!F))`: This evaluates to `!(!T)`, which is `!F`, and finally `T`. (1 expression)\n\nThis category gives a total of 3 true expressions.\n\n### Category 4: Expressions with a top-level binary operator (`&` or `|`)\nThese are expressions of the form `A op B` that are not enclosed in parentheses. Their total length is 5. We distinguish them by the top-level operator, which is determined by precedence.\n\n#### Sub-category 4a: Top-level operator is `|`\nDue to its lower precedence, `|` will be the top-level operator in any unparenthesized expression containing it along with `&`. We must consider all combinations for `A` and `B` where `length(A) + length(B) = 4`.\n\n*   **`A|B` where `A` is length 1 and `B` is length 3:**\n    *   If `A` is `T`, `T|B` is always true. `B` can be any of the 8 valid 3-symbol expressions that do not have `|` as a top-level operator (to avoid ambiguity, e.g., `T|T|T` is parsed as `(T|T)|T`). This gives 8 expressions (`T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`).\n    *   If `A` is `F`, `F|B` is true only if `B` is true. There are 3 such `B` expressions (`!!T`, `T&T`, `(T)`).\n*   **`A|B` where `A` is length 3 and `B` is length 1:**\n    *   If `B` is `T`, `A|T` is always true. `A` can be any of the 12 valid 3-symbol expressions.\n    *   If `B` is `F`, `A|F` is true only if `A` is true. There are 6 such `A` expressions.\n*   **`A|B` where `A` and `B` are length 2:**\n    *   `A` and `B` must be `!T` (false) or `!F` (true). For `A|B` to be true, at least one must be `!F`. This gives 3 combinations: `!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F`.\n\nTotal for this sub-category: 8 + 3 + 12 + 6 + 3 = 32 expressions.\n\n#### Sub-category 4b: Top-level operator is `&`\nThese expressions can only contain `&` and `!`, but not `|`, unless the `|` is inside parentheses.\n\n*   **`A&B` where `A` is length 1 and `B` is length 3:**\n    *   If `A` is `T`, `T&B` is true if `B` is true. `B` must be a true 3-symbol expression that doesn't contain top-level `&` or `|`. The valid `B` expressions are `!!T` and `(T)`. (2 expressions)\n*   **`A&B` where `A` is length 3 and `B` is length 1:**\n    *   Similarly, if `B` is `T`, `A` must be one of the 2 true expressions from the previous point. (2 expressions: `!!T&T`, `(T)&T`)\n*   **`A&B` where `A` and `B` are length 2:**\n    *   Both `A` and `B` must be true. The only true 2-symbol expression is `!F`. This gives 1 expression: `!F&!F`.\n\nTotal for this sub-category: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming up all categories:\n*   Category 1: 6\n*   Category 2: 6\n*   Category 3: 3\n*   Category 4 (4a + 4b): 32 + 5 = 37\n\nTotal = 6 + 6 + 3 + 37 = 52.\n\nThere are 52 distinct true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols.\n\n<<<52>>>"
