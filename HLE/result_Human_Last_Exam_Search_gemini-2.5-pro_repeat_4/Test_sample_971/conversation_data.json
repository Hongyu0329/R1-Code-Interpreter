    "Despite a thorough search for a precise count, the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of Don Quixote with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008 is not documented in available written records.\n\nNatalia Osipova, then a first soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, performed the role of Kitri in \"Don Quixote\" as a guest artist in several locations in 2008, including Novosibirsk, Siberia. Reviews from around that time praise her exceptional technical abilities in this role, noting her \"sparkling personality and breathtaking technique.\" Critics described her performances as including \"multiple pirouettes with a laugh\" and a \"dizzying series of revolutions,\" highlighting the joyful and technically demanding nature of her interpretation.\n\nThe Act I variation for Kitri is known to be energetic and challenging, culminating in a series of turns. However, specific choreographic notes detailing the exact number of each type of pirouette for Osipova's 2008 performances are not publicly available. While many videos of these performances exist online, a definitive textual analysis is not available to provide the requested number.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number for the pirouettes as the available data does not contain this level of choreographic detail and I am unable to watch and count the steps from video performances.>>>"
