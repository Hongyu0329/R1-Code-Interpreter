The general representation for the infinitesimal transformations on the variable `x`, denoted by `ξ(t, x, u)`, depends on the value of the parameter `k_1`. There are two possible forms:

1.  **For the case where `k_1 ≠ 0`:**
    The transformation is a function of time `t` only:
    `ξ(t, x, u) = C_1 e^{k_1 t} + C_2`
    where `C_1` and `C_2` are arbitrary constants.

2.  **For the case where `k_1 = 0` (the equation becomes linear):**
    The transformation is a function of time `t` and space `x`:
    `ξ(t, x, u) = C_1 tx + C_2 x + C_3 t + C_4`
    where `C_1`, `C_2`, `C_3`, and `C_4` are arbitrary constants.
