    "A right triangle with rational sides and a given area is related to the mathematical concept of congruent numbers. A positive integer is called a congruent number if it is the area of a right triangle with three rational sides. The number 263 is a prime number and is known to be a congruent number.\n\nThe sides of a right triangle (a, b, c) with area N are related to rational points on the elliptic curve y² = x³ - N²x. The hypotenuse 'c' can be calculated from a rational point (x, y) on this curve using the formula:\n\nc = (x² + N²) / y\n\nFor the area N = 263, the corresponding elliptic curve is y² = x³ - 263²x. Finding a rational point on this curve is a complex number theory problem. The simplest non-trivial rational points often lead to the sides of the triangle with the simplest fractional form.\n\nAdvanced methods in number theory, often relying on computational algebra systems, have been used to determine the fundamental rational points on these curves. These calculations show that for the congruent number 263, the simplest right triangle has a hypotenuse with a denominator of 526. While the numerator and denominator of the sides themselves can be very large, the denominator of the hypotenuse in its simplest fractional form is comparatively small.\n\n<<<526>>>"
