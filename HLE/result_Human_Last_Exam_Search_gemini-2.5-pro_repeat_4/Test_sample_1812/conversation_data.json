    "The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\nThe matrix provided is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTo compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix, we can use the standard formula:\n`det(A) = 2 * (2*2 - (-1)*(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)*2 - (-1)*(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*(-1))`\n`det(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)`\n`det(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3`\n`det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0`\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that the sum of the elements in each row of the matrix is zero:\n*   Row 1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\n*   Row 2: -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\n*   Row 3: -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\n\nA property of matrices states that if the sum of the entries in each row is 0, then the vector `[1, 1, 1]` is an eigenvector of the matrix with an eigenvalue of 0. If a matrix has an eigenvalue of 0, its determinant must be 0.\n\nThe provided matrix `A` is the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph with three vertices, Kâ‚ƒ. A property of the Laplacian matrix of any connected graph is that its determinant is always zero.\n\nThe mention of \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" appears to be extraneous information, as the matrix is explicitly defined.\n\n<<<0>>>"
