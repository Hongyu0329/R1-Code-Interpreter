    "If two people cooperated to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, 14 edge squares would remain without bishops.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. These consist of the 8 squares in the top row, 8 in the bottom row, and the 6 squares on the left and right sides that are not in the corners. A bishop attacks only along diagonals, meaning it can only attack other pieces on squares of the same color. The 28 edge squares are evenly divided into 14 light-colored squares and 14 dark-colored squares.\n\nTo place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares so that none can attack each other, they must all be placed on squares of the same color. By placing a bishop on all 14 squares of one color (either light or dark), no two bishops will share a diagonal. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge is 14.\n\nWith 14 of the 28 edge squares occupied by bishops, there would be 14 empty edge squares remaining.\n\n<<<14>>>"
