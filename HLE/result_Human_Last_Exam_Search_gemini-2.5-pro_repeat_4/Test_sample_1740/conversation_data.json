    "To date, a total of 12 members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans. These members are encoded by genes located on different chromosomes.\n\nThe human let-7 family includes the following mature microRNAs:\n\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nIt is important to note that while some sources may mention nine or ten members, this is often due to referring to the number of unique mature sequences, where some members are encoded by multiple genes. For instance, the mature let-7a is produced from three distinct genomic locations. Research and databases like miRBase have identified 12 let-7 paralogs in the human genome.\n\n<<<12>>>"
