    "Based on a thorough analysis of the board, the single optimal move for O to win as fast as possible is **f4**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this move is optimal:\n*   **Creates an Unstoppable Threat:** The move f4 creates a horizontal line of three O's in a row (d4, e4, f4). This forces X to block this threat on their next turn by playing in either c4 or g4.\n*   **Sets Up a Forced Win:** While X is forced to block the horizontal threat, they cannot simultaneously prevent O's winning move. O has a pre-existing diagonal of three O's (c6, d5, e4). The move f4 makes the winning spot f3 available on O's next turn. After X plays either c4 or g4, O can play f3 to complete the diagonal and win the game.\n*   **Blocks the Opponent:** Player X has a potential threat with their pieces at d6 and e5, which could become a line of three by playing at f4. By playing f4, O not only advances their own winning plan but also blocks X's potential threat.\n\nAny other move by O allows X to play f4, which would create a powerful threat for X and force O into a defensive position, losing the winning advantage.\n\n<<<f4>>>"
