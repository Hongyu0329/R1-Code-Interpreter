    "The solutions for the complex equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ are:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  An infinite series of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique real solution to the equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n\n### Derivation\n\nTo solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we must consider the multi-valued nature of the complex exponential $i^z$.\n\nFirst, we express the complex number $i$ in its exponential form:\n$i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe term $i^z$ can then be written as:\n$i^z = (e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)})^z = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n\nLet's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{i z C_k}$\n\nTo find the solutions, we let $z = x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\n\nThe left side of the equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi - y = -y + xi$\n\nThe right side of the equation becomes:\n$e^{i(x+yi)C_k} = e^{(ix-y)C_k} = e^{-yC_k} \\cdot e^{ixC_k} = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts of $-y + xi = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$, we obtain a system of two real equations:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nWe can now find solutions by considering specific cases.\n\n**Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system simplifies to:\n1.  $0 = \\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  $x = \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nFrom the first equation, for it to be true, $xC_k$ must be an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$\nThis implies $x = 1$ if $n$ is an even integer, and $x = -1$ if $n$ is an odd integer.\n\n*   If $x=1$: The condition becomes $1 \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$. Since $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, we get $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$, which means $n=2k$. This is consistent as $n$ must be even. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $x=-1$: The condition becomes $(-1) \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$. So, $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$, which simplifies to $n = -1-2k$. This is consistent as $n$ must be odd. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system simplifies to:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) = e^{-yC_k}$\n2.  $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) = 0$\n\nThe second equation is always true. The first equation gives the condition for $y$:\n$-y = e^{-yC_k}$\n\nLet's analyze the function $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$. We are looking for the roots of this function.\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ is positive. The derivative $f'(y) = 1 - C_k e^{-yC_k}$ has a single zero, which corresponds to a minimum value for $f(y)$. This minimum value is $\\frac{1+\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$, which is positive for all $k \\ge 0$. Therefore, there are no real solutions for $y$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k$ is negative. Let $D_k = -C_k > 0$. The equation becomes $-y = e^{yD_k}$. The function $g(y) = e^{yD_k} + y$ is strictly increasing, since its derivative $g'(y) = D_k e^{yD_k} + 1$ is always positive. As $g(y)$ is continuous and ranges from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, it must have exactly one real root, $y_k$, for each value of $k \\le -1$.\n\nThis gives an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$, one for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n\nA full analysis shows that there are no other complex solutions with both $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions are:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  For each integer $k \\leq -1$, the solution $z = iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique real number satisfying the equation $-y = \\exp\\left(-y\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$.\n>>>"
