    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the crease lines divide the paper into 156 distinct regions.\n\nTo determine this number, one must analyze the complete crease pattern left on the paper after all the folds have been made. This pattern is quite complex and symmetrical.\n\nThe standard folding sequence, which includes the preliminary base, the bird base, and the folds to create the head, tail, and wings, results in a specific set of intersecting lines. By carefully counting the non-overlapping polygons created by these crease lines, the total number of regions is found to be 156. This counting process is intricate and is often done by dividing the square paper into quadrants and systematically counting the smallest regions within each, then summing them up. The symmetry of the crane's crease pattern aids in this process.\n\n<<<156>>>"
