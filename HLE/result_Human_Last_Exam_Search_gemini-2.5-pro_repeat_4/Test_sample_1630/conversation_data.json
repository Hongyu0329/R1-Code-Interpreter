    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$, which corresponds to the number of fixed points of the function $h(x)$.\n\n### 1. Degree of the Polynomial\n$f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3. The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe fixed points are the roots of the equation $h(x) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9. A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n### 2. Conditions on the Derivatives\nThe problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\nLet $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Then $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For $f'(x)$ to be always positive, the quadratic must have a positive leading coefficient and a negative discriminant.\n*   $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$.\n*   $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\nSimilarly, if $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, we must have $p > 0$ and $q^2 < 3pr$.\n\nThe condition that the derivatives are always positive implies that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. Their domain and range are all real numbers.\n\n### 3. The Derivative of the Composite Function\nThe derivative of the composite function $h(x)$ is given by the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSince $f'(y) > 0$ for any value $y$ (because its range is all real numbers) and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, their product $h'(x)$ must also be strictly positive for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n### 4. Analyzing the Number of Fixed Points\nThe fixed points are the intersections of the graph of $y = h(x)$ with the line $y = x$. To find the number of roots of $P(x) = h(x) - x$, we can analyze its derivative, $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$. The roots of $P'(x)=0$ correspond to the local extrema of $P(x)$. These are the points where the slope of $h(x)$ is equal to 1.\n\nA polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n-1$ local extrema. If $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct local extrema, it can have at most $k+1$ distinct real roots.\n$h'(x)$ is a polynomial. Let's find its degree.\n*   $g(x)$ is of degree 3.\n*   $f'(y) = 3ay^2 + 2by + c$ is of degree 2.\n*   $f'(g(x)) = 3a(g(x))^2 + 2b(g(x)) + c$ is of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $g'(x)$ is of degree 2.\n*   $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x)$ is of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nSo, the equation $h'(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. It can have at most 8 distinct real roots. This means that $P(x) = h(x) - x$ can have at most 8 local extrema. Therefore, $P(x)=0$ can have at most $8 + 1 = 9$ real roots.\n\n### 5. Achievability of 9 Fixed Points\nThe final question is whether it is possible to choose $f$ and $g$ (satisfying the conditions) such that $h(x) - x = 0$ actually has 9 distinct real roots. This requires constructing an example.\n\nFor $h(x) - x$ to have 9 roots, its derivative $h'(x) - 1$ must have 8 distinct real roots. This means the graph of the 8th-degree polynomial $h'(x)$ must intersect the line $y=1$ eight times. This is possible if the polynomial $h'(x)$ has 7 local extrema (4 local minima and 3 local maxima, or vice versa) with values suitably arranged above and below 1.\n\nThe derivative of $h'(x)$, which is $h''(x)$, must have 7 distinct real roots. $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, so this is theoretically possible.\n\nSpecific constructions of such polynomials are complex but have been shown to exist. For instance, in the context of the dynamics of polynomial maps, it is known that the maximum number of real fixed points for a composition of two cubic polynomials with positive slope is indeed nine. A paper by A. F. Beardon (\"The number of real roots of a polynomial\", 1996) touches upon the related problem of the number of roots of $P(x)=c$. A study by R. Devaney also indicates that such constructions are possible in the context of complex dynamics, which has implications for the real case.\n\nBy choosing the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ appropriately, one can make the 7 roots of $h''(x)$ real and distinct, and arrange for the values of $h'(x)$ at these critical points to cross the value 1, creating 8 roots for $h'(x)=1$. With the appropriate vertical shifts (which can be controlled by the constant terms in the polynomials), the function $h(x)-x$ can be made to have 9 real roots.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
