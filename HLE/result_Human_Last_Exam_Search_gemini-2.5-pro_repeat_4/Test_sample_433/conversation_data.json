    "### No Storage Permitted for Opened Single-Dose Ampules\n\nOnce a single-dose glass ampule is punctured in a sterile environment, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period. This is a strict guideline due to the nature of the container.\n\nAccording to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>, which sets the standards for sterile compounding, \"Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any time period\". The National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) further clarifies this by stating, \"No storage of an open ampoule is permitted; as such, no BUD applies\". The term \"BUD\" refers to the Beyond-Use Date, which is the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation should not be used.\n\nThis immediate-use requirement stems from the fact that once an ampule is broken, it cannot be resealed, leaving the contents exposed to potential microbial contamination. Unlike vials, ampules do not contain preservatives to inhibit bacterial growth.\n\nIn contrast, a single-dose *vial* that has been punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, as long as storage requirements are maintained. If punctured in an environment with air quality worse than ISO Class 5, a single-dose vial must be discarded after one hour. These distinctions highlight the critical differences in handling various single-dose containers.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any time period and must be used immediately after opening.>>>"
