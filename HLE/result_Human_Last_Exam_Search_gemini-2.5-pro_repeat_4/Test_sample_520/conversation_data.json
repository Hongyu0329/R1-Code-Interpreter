    "The story of a Belgian refugee in the UK during World War II who was falsely believed to be a German spy because he concealed his true profession is a case investigated by the famous counterintelligence officer Lt. Col. Oreste Pinto. While the name in the query is Andre Vernault, the actual individual in Pinto's memoirs is identified as Emile Boulanger. His concealed true profession was that of a **professional soldier and spy for the Germans**.\n\nBoulanger arrived in the UK claiming to be a simple Belgian farmer, and he played the part convincingly, with rough, soil-engrained hands and a detailed knowledge of farming. However, his story aroused the suspicion of Oreste Pinto, a Dutch interrogator working for MI5, who was known for his sharp instincts and psychological methods.\n\nPinto employed several tricks to uncover Boulanger's deception. In one instance, while Boulanger was asleep, Pinto had smoke blown under his cell door and had soldiers shout \"Fire!\" in German (\"Feuer!\"). Boulanger did not react, but did respond when the alarm was raised in French (\"Au feu!\"). This initially seemed to suggest he did not understand German. However, Pinto remained unconvinced. In a final test, Pinto told Boulanger in German that he was free to go. When Boulanger reacted with relief, he revealed his knowledge of the language and was arrested.\n\nThrough his investigation, Pinto determined that Emile Boulanger was, in fact, not a farmer but a trained German spy and a professional soldier.\n\nWhile the name Andre Vernault is not found in connection with this specific, well-documented case, it is possible it is a pseudonym used in a fictionalized retelling of the events. However, the details of the case of Emile Boulanger, the supposed farmer, directly align with the scenario described in the user's request.\n\n<<<A professional soldier and spy for the Germans.>>>"
