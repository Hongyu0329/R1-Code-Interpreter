    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While there are a number of mushroom species that are themselves blue, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nSome well-known blue-colored mushrooms and their corresponding spore print colors include:\n\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***, known as the indigo milk cap, has a cream-colored spore print.\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea***, the blue roundhead, produces a dark purple-brown to purple-black spore print.\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***, a vibrant blue mushroom native to New Zealand, has a pink spore print.\n*   ***Mycena interrupta***, or the pixie's parasol, has a white spore print.\n\nThe color of a mushroom's fruiting body does not determine the color of its spores. Therefore, despite the existence of various blue mushrooms, a genus with a blue spore print has not been identified.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
