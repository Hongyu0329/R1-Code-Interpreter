    "The search results confirm my initial analysis.\nFor $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the curve $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$ describes the upper half of a unit circle. The search results confirm that this parameterization with the given interval for t represents a semi-circle. The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$. The y-values range from $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ down to $\\sin(0)=0$ and $\\sin(\\pi)=0$, so the range for y is $$.\n\nFor $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the curve is $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5\\sin t$. This represents the lower half of an ellipse with a semi-minor axis of 1 and a semi-major axis of 5. The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$. Since $t$ is in $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin(t)$ is negative. The y-values range from $5 \\times \\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ to $5 \\times \\sin(\\pi \\text{ or } 2\\pi) = 0$. So the range for y on this part is $[-5, 0)$.\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the entire figure, we need to find the overall minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.\n-   **x-range**: For the entire curve, the x-values are determined by $\\cos t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, which spans the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n-   **y-range**: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, y is in $$. For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, y is in $[-5, 0)$. Combining these, the total y-range is $[-5, 1]$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a bounding box defined by these ranges:\n-   Width = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n-   Height = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest square that can enclose this rectangular bounding box must have a side length equal to the maximum of the width and height.\nSide length of the square = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\nThe search results confirm the understanding of parametric curves for circles and ellipses and the concept of a bounding box. The reasoning seems sound.\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. Deconstruct the parametric curve into its parts.\n2. Determine the range of x and y for each part.\n3. Combine the ranges to find the overall min/max for x and y.\n4. This defines the dimensions of the axis-aligned bounding rectangle.\n5. The side of the smallest enclosing square is the larger of the two dimensions of the bounding rectangle.\n6. The area is the square of this side length.\n\nThe logic is solid. No further searching is required.\n\nFinal answer will be 36.\n<<<36>>>The curve is defined in two parts.\n\nFor the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.
