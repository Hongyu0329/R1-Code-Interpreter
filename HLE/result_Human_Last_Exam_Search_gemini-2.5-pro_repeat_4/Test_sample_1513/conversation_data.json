    "There is no island town that perfectly matches the description of being more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, sitting on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name.\n\nSeveral remote islands exhibit some of the mentioned characteristics, but none fulfill all of them:\n\n*   **Tristan da Cunha**, the world's most remote inhabited island, is a volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean, located about 2,400 kilometers from the nearest inhabited land of Saint Helena. Its only settlement is named **Edinburgh of the Seven Seas**. However, the town is situated on a flat coastal plain at the base of the main volcano, not on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n\n*   **Pitcairn Island**, a remote volcanic island in the South Pacific, has a settlement called **Adamstown**. The town lies within a volcanic basin, but the adjacent bay is known as Bounty Bay.\n\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**, another isolated volcanic island in the Pacific, features several extinct volcanoes with craters, including the notable Rano Kau caldera. The main town, **Hanga Roa**, is located in a lowland area between two volcanoes but not directly on a caldera bay.\n\n*   **Deception Island**, an active volcano in Antarctica, has a distinctive horseshoe shape with a large, flooded caldera called **Port Foster**. [No specific source from results] While it was once home to a whaling station at **Whalers Bay**, it currently has no permanent inhabitants, only seasonal researchers. [No specific source from results] Furthermore, the names of the bay and the former settlement are different.\n\n*   Other islands with towns on calderas, such as **Santorini** in Greece, **Rabaul** in Papua New Guinea, and **Aogashima** in Japan, are not more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n\nTherefore, based on available information, an island town meeting all the specified criteria does not exist.\n\n<<<There is no island town that perfectly matches the description.>>>"
