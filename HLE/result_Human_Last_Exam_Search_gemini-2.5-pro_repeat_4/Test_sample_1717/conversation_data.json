    "Based on the health scaling formula for bosses in Terraria's Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players is infinite.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the calculation:\n\nIn Expert Mode, the health of a boss is determined by the following formula:\n`Expert Health = Base Health (Expert) * Multiplayer Factor`\n\nFor the Eye of Cthulhu, the base health for a single player in Expert Mode is 3,640.\n\nThe `Multiplayer Factor` for *n* players is calculated as follows:\n`Multiplayer Factor = 1 + HealthAdded[2] + HealthAdded[3] + ... + HealthAdded[n]`\n\nThe amount of health added for each additional player is determined by a recursive formula:\n*   `HealthAdded[2] = 0.35` (This means the second player adds 35% of the base health)\n*   `HealthAdded[k+1] = HealthAdded[k] + (1 - HealthAdded[k]) / 3` for `k >= 2`\n\nTo find the theoretical maximum health for an infinite number of players, we need to determine the limit of the `Multiplayer Factor` as *n* approaches infinity.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the `HealthAdded[k]` sequence. As *k* (the number of players) increases, the value of `HealthAdded[k]` gets closer and closer to 1. In mathematics, we say the limit of `HealthAdded[k]` as *k* approaches infinity is 1.\n\nThe `Multiplayer Factor` is a sum of these `HealthAdded` terms. Since each term gets closer to 1, we are continually adding a value close to 1 for each new player. A sum of an infinite number of terms that do not approach zero will grow infinitely large. This is known as a divergent series.\n\nBecause the `Multiplayer Factor` grows infinitely large as the number of players approaches infinity, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu, which is a product of this factor and the base health, is also infinite.\n\nWhile in practice the game has a limit of 255 players per server, the mathematical formula for health scaling does not have an upper bound.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
