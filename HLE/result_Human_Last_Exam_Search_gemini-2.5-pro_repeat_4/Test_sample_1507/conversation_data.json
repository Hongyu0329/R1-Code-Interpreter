    "### The great icosahedron's visible exterior is a familiar Platonic solid, requiring 20 triangles for its triangulation.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20. This is because the outer-hull, or more formally, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. Its structure consists of 20 intersecting triangular faces, with five triangles meeting at each vertex in a pentagrammic sequence. While the great icosahedron itself is a complex, self-intersecting shape, its outermost boundary forms a much simpler, convex shape.\n\nThis convex hull is in fact the well-known regular icosahedron, a Platonic solid with 20 faces. Each of these faces is an equilateral triangle. Therefore, the \"visible triangles from the outside\" of a great icosahedron correspond to the 20 faces of its icosahedral convex hull. Since the faces of the convex hull are already triangles, the triangulation is inherent to its structure, and the minimal number of triangles required is simply the number of its faces.\n\n<<<20>>>"
