    "To find the state feedback gain matrix F such that the eigenvalues of A + BF are at -1 ± j, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the desired characteristic equation.**\n    The desired eigenvalues are λ₁ = -1 + j and λ₂ = -1 - j. The characteristic polynomial corresponding to these eigenvalues is:\n    p(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)\n    p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))\n    p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)\n    p(λ) = (λ + 1)² - (j)²\n    p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 + 1\n    p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2\n    So, the desired characteristic equation is λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0.\n\n2.  **Define the closed-loop system matrix.**\n    Let the state feedback gain matrix be a 2x2 matrix:\n    F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]\n\n    The closed-loop system matrix is A_cl = A + BF:\n    A_cl = [[-1, 1],] + [,] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]\n    A_cl = [[-1, 1],] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]\n    A_cl = [[f₁ + 2f₃ - 1, f₂ + 2f₄ + 1], [f₁ + 1, f₂]]\n\n3.  **Determine the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system.**\n    The characteristic equation for A_cl is given by det(λI - A_cl) = 0.\n    det(λI - A_cl) = λ² - trace(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl)\n\n    *   trace(A_cl) = (f₁ + 2f₃ - 1) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1\n    *   det(A_cl) = (f₁ + 2f₃ - 1)(f₂) - (f₂ + 2f₄ + 1)(f₁ + 1)\n        = f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - f₂ - (f₁f₂ + f₂ + 2f₁f₄ + 2f₄ + f₁ + 1)\n        = -f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₁f₄ - 2f₄ - 1\n\n    So the characteristic equation is:\n    λ² - (f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1)λ + (-f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₁f₄ - 2f₄ - 1) = 0\n\n4.  **Equate the coefficients of the two characteristic equations.**\n    By comparing `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0` with the equation from step 3, we get two equations:\n\n    *   Coefficient of λ:\n        -(f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1) = 2  =>  f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1  (Eq. 1)\n    *   Constant term:\n        -f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₁f₄ - 2f₄ - 1 = 2  =>  -f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₁f₄ - 2f₄ = 3  (Eq. 2)\n\n5.  **Solve for the elements of F.**\n    We have two equations and four unknowns (f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄), which means there are infinite solutions. We can find one particular solution by making a simplifying assumption. Let's assume the second row of F is zero, i.e., f₃ = 0 and f₄ = 0.\n\n    The equations become:\n    *   f₁ + f₂ = -1  (from Eq. 1)\n    *   -f₁ - 2f₂ = 3  (from Eq. 2)\n\n    Now we solve this system of two equations:\n    Add the two equations together:\n    (f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3\n    -f₂ = 2\n    f₂ = -2\n\n    Substitute f₂ = -2 into the first new equation:\n    f₁ + (-2) = -1\n    f₁ = 1\n\n    Thus, a valid feedback gain matrix is f₁=1, f₂=-2, f₃=0, f₄=0.\n\n    F = [[1, -2],]\n\nWe can verify this result.\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [,] * [[1, -2],]\n= [[-1, 1],] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]\n= [[0, -1], [2, -2]]\nThe characteristic equation of this matrix is det(λI - (A+BF)) = λ(λ+2) - (-1)(2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0. The roots of this equation are indeed -1 ± j.\n\n<<<[[1, -2],]>>>"
