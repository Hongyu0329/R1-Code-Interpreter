The unique $\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is the injective cogenerator $D(A) = I_1 \oplus I_2 \oplus I_3$. In terms of interval modules, this is $M_{11} \oplus M_{12} \oplus M_{123}$. As representations, this is the direct sum of $(\mathbb{C} \to 0 \to 0)$, $(\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C} \to 0)$, and $(\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C})$.
