    "A single patch of surface code with two holes can encode at most two logical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded on a surface is determined by its topology, specifically the number of independent, non-trivial loops (or cycles) that can exist on it. Each \"hole\" or defect introduced into the surface code can give rise to a new, independent logical qubit.\n\nWhile it is common to use a pair of holes to define a single logical qubit for practical reasons related to performing logical operations, the presence of two distinct holes on a single surface code patch fundamentally allows for two independent logical qubits. This is because one can define logical operators that loop around each of the two holes, and these operators will be independent, a requirement for defining separate qubits. For instance, one source explicitly shows a surface code with two holes encoding two logical qubits and another with four holes encoding four logical qubits.\n\nGiven that the question specifies *two* patches of surface code, and each patch has two holes, the total number of logical qubits would be the sum of the logical qubits from each patch. Therefore, each of the two patches can encode two logical qubits, leading to a total of four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
