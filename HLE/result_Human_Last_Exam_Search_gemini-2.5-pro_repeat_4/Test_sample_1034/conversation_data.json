    "To solve this problem, we must first understand the conditions under which two possible triangles can be formed, and then determine the value of S.\n\n### Analysis of the Geometric Condition\n\nThe problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines (SSA condition). We are given two sides and a non-included angle:\n*   Side `BC = S`\n*   Side `AC`\n*   Angle `∠B = 30°`\n\nLet `a = BC = S`, `b = AC`, and `c = AB`. We are given `∠B = 30°`. For there to be two possible values for the side length `AB`, there must be two distinct triangles that can be formed with the given side `BC`, side `AC`, and angle `∠B`.\n\nThis ambiguous case results in two triangles if and only if the side opposite the given angle (`AC`) is shorter than the other given side (`BC`) but longer than the altitude from vertex `C` to the line containing side `AB`.\n\nLet `h` be the length of the altitude from vertex `C` to the line containing side `AB`. We can calculate `h` as:\n`h = BC * sin(∠B)`\n`h = S * sin(30°)`\nSince `sin(30°) = 0.5`, we have:\n`h = S / 2`\n\nThe condition for two possible triangles is `h < AC < BC`.\nSubstituting the values, we get the inequality:\n`S/2 < AC < S`\n\n### Counting the Integer Values\n\nThe problem requires us to find the number of possible *integer* values for the side length `AC`. We need to count the number of integers that lie strictly between `S/2` and `S`.\n\nLet `N` be the number of these integer values. The range of integer values for `AC` starts at the first integer greater than `S/2` and ends at the last integer less than `S`.\n*   The smallest integer greater than `S/2` is `floor(S/2) + 1`.\n*   The largest integer less than `S` is `S - 1`.\n\nThe total number of integers in this range is:\n`N = (S - 1) - (floor(S/2) + 1) + 1`\n`N = S - 1 - floor(S/2)`\n\nThis formula can be simplified depending on whether S is even or odd:\n*   **If S is even**, let `S = 2k`. The number of integers is `2k - 1 - k = k - 1`, which is `S/2 - 1`.\n*   **If S is odd**, let `S = 2k + 1`. The number of integers is `(2k + 1) - 1 - k = k`, which is `(S-1)/2`.\n\nBoth of these cases can be expressed by the single formula: `floor((S-1)/2)`.\n\n### Determining the Value of S\n\nThe variable `S` is defined as `SNYWR`, which stands for \"Single Number You Will Really Need.\" This is a placeholder term commonly used in mathematics competitions, where the value is provided at the beginning of the contest or in its instructions. Without the specific context of the competition from which this problem was taken, the value of `S` cannot be determined from general knowledge or web searches.\n\nTherefore, a final numerical answer cannot be computed. The solution is dependent on the specific value assigned to `S`. The number of integer values for `AC` is given by the formula derived above.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe number of integer values for `AC` is `floor((S-1)/2)`.\n\nWithout the value of S, a numerical answer cannot be provided."
