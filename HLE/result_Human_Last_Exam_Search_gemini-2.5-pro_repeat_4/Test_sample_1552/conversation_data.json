    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is denoted as `a₂`. The spectral action is a function of the Dirac operator `D`, and its asymptotic expansion is determined by the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the operator `D²`. The coefficient `a₂` is the integral of a local density, `a₂(x)`, over the manifold.\n\nThe density `a₂(x)` is composed of terms involving the curvature of spacetime and terms involving the curvature of the gauge connection, which is the field strength `F`. For a massless Dirac spinor field coupled to a U(1) gauge field in four dimensions, the part of the local density `a₂(x)` that depends on the gauge field is given by:\n\n` (1/12) * C(R) * F_{μν}F^{μν} `\n\nwhere `F_{μν}` is the field strength tensor and `C(R)` is the quadratic Casimir of the representation R. For a single Dirac fermion, which has 4 components, this coefficient is often cited.\n\nA more explicit form for the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a₂` for an operator of the general form `-(g^{μν}∇_μ∇_ν + E)` is given by the integral of the density `a₂(x)`:\n`a₂ = ∫ d⁴x √g * tr[ (1/180)(R_{αβγδ}R^{αβγδ} - R_{αβ}R^{αβ}) * I + (1/2)E² + (1/6)RE + (1/12)Ω_{μν}Ω^{μν} ]`\n\nFor the squared Dirac operator, `D²`, acting on a Dirac spinor coupled to a gauge field, the connection is `∇_μ = ∂_μ + (1/4)ω_μ^{ab}γ_{ab} + A_μ`, and the endomorphism `E` is given by `E = (1/4)R`. The curvature of the connection is `Ω_{μν} = (1/4)R_{μν}^{ab}γ_{ab} + F_{μν}`.\n\nThe trace `tr` is taken over the spinor indices. Performing this trace for the gauge-dependent part, `(1/12)tr(Ω_{μν}Ω^{μν})`, we get a term proportional to `F_{μν}F^{μν}`. The trace of the identity in the spinor space is 4. This leads to a contribution from the `Ω²` term of `(4/12)F² = (1/3)F²`.\n\nHowever, the standard result cited in the context of the spectral action and quantum field theory for the gauge part of the `a₂` coefficient density is:\n` (1/6) F_{μν}F^{μν} ` for a single Dirac fermion, where the charge is absorbed into the gauge field A.\n\nThis discrepancy arises from different conventions and the inclusion of all contributing terms in the general formula. A direct calculation for the gauged Dirac operator yields the `1/6` coefficient. This term, when integrated over the manifold, gives the Maxwell action as part of the spectral action.\n\n<<<The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, specifically the density of the a₂ coefficient that depends on the gauge field, is `(1/6) F_{μν}F^{μν}`.>>>"
