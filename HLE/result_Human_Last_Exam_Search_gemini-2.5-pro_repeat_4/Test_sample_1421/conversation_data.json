    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by:\n\n<<<\nThe fermionic partition function, denoted by Z, is a cornerstone in quantum statistical mechanics for describing systems of fermions at a finite temperature. In the imaginary time representation, it is expressed using Feynman's path integral formalism, which involves integrating over all possible field configurations.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ] exp(-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ])**\n\nwhere:\n\n*   **Z** is the partition function. It is fundamentally defined as the trace of the evolution operator in imaginary time, Z = Tr(e<sup>-βH</sup>), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system and β is the inverse temperature (β = 1/k<sub>B</sub>T).\n\n*   **∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ]** is the functional integral, often called the path integral, over all possible histories of the fermionic fields.\n\n*   **ψ(x, τ)** and **ψ̄(x, τ)** are the fermionic fields and their adjoints, respectively. These are not ordinary numbers but are elements of a Grassmann algebra, also known as anti-commuting numbers. This is necessary to correctly account for the Pauli exclusion principle that governs fermions. They are functions of spatial coordinates **x** and imaginary time **τ**.\n\n*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system. It is obtained from the standard action in Minkowski spacetime by a Wick rotation, where real time *t* is replaced by imaginary time *τ* (*t* → -i*τ*). The Euclidean action is given by the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density, L<sub>E</sub>, over imaginary time and space:\n    **S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d-1</sup>x L<sub>E</sub>(ψ̄, ψ, ∂<sub>μ</sub>ψ̄, ∂<sub>μ</sub>ψ)**\n\nA crucial aspect of the fermionic path integral in imaginary time is the boundary conditions imposed on the fields. Unlike bosonic fields which have periodic boundary conditions, fermionic fields must satisfy **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in the imaginary time direction.\n\n*   **ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ)**\n*   **ψ̄(x, τ + β) = -ψ̄(x, τ)**\n\nThis anti-periodicity is a direct consequence of the anti-commutation relations of fermionic operators.\n\nFor a common example, such as a non-interacting Dirac fermion field, the Euclidean action is typically of the form:\n\n**S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>3</sup>x ψ̄(x, τ) (γ<sup>μ</sup>∂<sub>μ</sub> + m) ψ(x, τ)**\n(The specific form can vary depending on the conventions for the gamma matrices in Euclidean space).\n\nIn essence, the path integral formulation provides a powerful method to compute the partition function by summing over all possible field histories, each weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action. This establishes a deep connection between quantum field theory and statistical mechanics.\n>>>"
