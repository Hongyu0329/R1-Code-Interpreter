Based on the provided information, I have outlined a comprehensive, command-line-based bioinformatics filtering strategy to address the issue of cancer gene contamination in your RNA-seq samples. This strategy involves a two-pass differential expression analysis pipeline to identify and remove contaminant genes before conducting the final analysis. The steps include an initial DESeq2 run to generate log2 fold changes and normalized counts, a Python script to apply filtering logic based on log fold change and expression thresholds, a `grep` command to create a clean count matrix, and a final DESeq2 analysis on the filtered data. This method is designed to be robust and directly implementable within your existing analysis framework.
