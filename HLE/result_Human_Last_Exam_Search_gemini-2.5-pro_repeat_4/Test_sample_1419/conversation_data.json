    "## Wilson-Fischer Fixed Point Emerges in ϕ⁴ Theory Near Four Dimensions\n\n**The leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, in the ϕ⁴ theory near four spatial dimensions is given by u* = (2/3)ε, where ε = 4 - d represents the deviation from four dimensions.**\n\nThis result is a cornerstone of the modern understanding of critical phenomena and is derived using the renormalization group (RG) framework, specifically through a technique known as the epsilon expansion. The ϕ⁴ theory, a fundamental model in quantum field theory, describes a scalar field with a quartic self-interaction. While in exactly four dimensions the theory is believed to be \"trivial\" (non-interacting), below four dimensions a non-trivial, interacting fixed point emerges, known as the Wilson-Fischer fixed point.\n\nThe existence of this fixed point is crucial as it governs the universal critical behavior of a wide range of physical systems, such as the liquid-gas critical point and the ferromagnetic phase transition in the Ising model. The epsilon expansion, pioneered by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher, treats ε as a small parameter, allowing for perturbative calculations of physical quantities near the critical point.\n\nThe calculation begins with the renormalization group flow equations, which describe how the couplings of the theory change at different length scales. For the ϕ⁴ theory, the beta function for the dimensionless coupling constant `u` at the one-loop level is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -εu + (3/2)u²\n\nA fixed point of the RG flow is a point where the beta function is zero, signifying that the coupling constant no longer changes with scale. This equation has two solutions: the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0, and the non-trivial Wilson-Fischer fixed point. By setting β(u) = 0, we find the leading order expression for the interacting fixed point:\n\n-εu* + (3/2)(u*)² = 0\nu* ( -ε + (3/2)u* ) = 0\n\nThis yields the non-trivial solution:\n\n**u* = (2/3)ε**\n\nThis result demonstrates that the interacting fixed point is located at a value of the coupling that is directly proportional to the deviation from four dimensions. This fixed point is essential for calculating critical exponents, which characterize the singular behavior of physical quantities near a continuous phase transition.\n\n<<<u* = (2/3)ε>>>"
