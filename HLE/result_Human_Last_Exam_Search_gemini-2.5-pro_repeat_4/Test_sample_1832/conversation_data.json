    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which are derived from the metric, represent the gravitational field's strength and are crucial for calculating the paths of particles (geodesics).\n\nFor the Schwarzschild metric in standard spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, there are a total of $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ Christoffel symbols. However, due to the symmetries of the metric, most of these are zero. The non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr} = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{tr} = \\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi\\theta} = \\cot\\theta$\n\nDue to the symmetry of the lower indices of the Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), some of the listed components are identical. After accounting for this symmetry, we can count the number of unique non-zero Christoffel symbols. There are 9 distinct non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n<<<9>>>"
