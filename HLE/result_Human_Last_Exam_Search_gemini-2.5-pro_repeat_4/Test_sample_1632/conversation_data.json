    "A self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, also known as a square lattice, is a path on a grid that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of such walks of a specific length, n, is denoted by a(n). These numbers are well-studied and are listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A001411.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the number of possible paths, a(10), is 44,100. There is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, and the computation for larger values of n is a significant challenge.\n\nThe initial terms of the sequence a(n) are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
