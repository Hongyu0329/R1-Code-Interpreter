    "The search results confirm that the given chess position is a mate-in-4 puzzle. The winning sequence of moves for White is as follows:\n\n1.  **Qxf7+**: White initiates a direct attack on the Black king. Black's only legal response is to move the king to h8.\n2.  **Qf8+**: This move forces Black's rook to capture the queen (Rxf8), as it is the only way to get out of check.\n3.  **Rxf8+**: White's rook on f1 captures Black's rook on f8, delivering another check. Black's king is forced to move to h7.\n4.  **Ng6#**: The white knight moves to g6, delivering a checkmate. The knight is protected by the white bishop on h5, and the king has no safe squares to move to.\n\nTherefore, assuming optimal play from both sides, White can win in 4 moves.\n\n<<<4>>>"
