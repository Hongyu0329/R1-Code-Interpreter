The edges of the image will become smoother, with sharp corners being rounded off and small features being eliminated. The evolution of the edges approximates a geometric flow known as motion by mean curvature, eventually reaching a stable state where the minimum radius of curvature of any edge is dictated by the filter size Î´.
