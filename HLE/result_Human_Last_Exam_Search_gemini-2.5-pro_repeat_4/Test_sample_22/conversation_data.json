    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by the variance explained (R²), is theoretically capped by the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) of the phenotype. SNP heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) measured in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). It represents the theoretical maximum predictive power if the true effects of all SNPs were known.\n\nIn practice, the variance explained by a PGS is nearly always lower than the SNP heritability for several reasons:\n\n*   **Estimation Error:** A PGS is built using SNP effect sizes estimated from a GWAS with a finite sample size. These estimates contain statistical noise and are not the true effect sizes. This error reduces the predictive power of the resulting score.\n*   **Methodological Limitations:** The statistical methods used to construct the PGS, such as selecting SNPs based on p-value thresholds or applying shrinkage techniques, are imperfect and contribute to the gap between the PGS R² and SNP heritability.\n*   **Sample Differences:** The PGS is typically developed in a \"base\" or \"training\" dataset and then tested in an independent \"target\" dataset. Any differences in genetic ancestry, linkage disequilibrium patterns, or environmental factors between these samples will lower the predictive accuracy.\n\nAs GWAS sample sizes increase, the effect size estimates become more precise, and the R² of the resulting PGS can approach the SNP heritability. However, most current polygenic scores capture only a fraction of the SNP heritability. For instance, the SNP heritability for ADHD is estimated at 21.6%, while the best polygenic score explains a maximum of 5.5% of the variance. This gap between the variance captured by a PGS and the estimated SNP heritability can be conceptualized as a form of measurement error in the score.\n\nWhile SNP heritability is considered the theoretical upper limit for the R² of a PGS, one study noted that in specific, complex scenarios involving heterogeneity between cohorts in a meta-analysis, it is possible for the out-of-sample prediction R² to exceed the estimated SNP heritability. However, this is an exception to the general principle that SNP heritability sets the ceiling for PGS prediction.\n\n<<<True>>>"
