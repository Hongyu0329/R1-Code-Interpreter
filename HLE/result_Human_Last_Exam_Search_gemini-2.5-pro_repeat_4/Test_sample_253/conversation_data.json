    "To determine the binary pattern after applying Rule 110 for 20 steps starting from a single '1' cell, a computational simulation is required. Rule 110 is an elementary cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its own state and the states of its left and right neighbors.\n\nThe rule can be summarized by the transformations of 8 possible three-cell patterns:\n*   `111` → `0`\n*   `110` → `1`\n*   `101` → `1`\n*   `100` → `0`\n*   `011` → `1`\n*   `010` → `1`\n*   `001` → `1`\n*   `000` → `0`\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single cell in state `1` (`...00100...`), each subsequent line (or \"generation\") is generated by applying these rules simultaneously to every cell. This process is deterministic, and after 20 applications of the rule, a specific binary pattern emerges.\n\nThe resulting pattern, after removing the leading and trailing zeros, is:\n\n<<<111011100110111101101100011110111>>>"
