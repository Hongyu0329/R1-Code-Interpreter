    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Ida on the island of Crete**.\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in Homer's epic poem, playing significant roles as settings for divine intervention and observation of the Trojan War. When comparing their heights, Mount Ida in Crete emerges as the highest peak after Mount Olympus.\n\nHere is a comparison of the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and their elevations:\n*   **Mount Olympus:** As the mythical home of the gods, it is the highest mountain in Greece, with a peak elevation of approximately 2,917 meters.\n*   **Mount Ida (Crete):** The highest mountain on Crete, Mount Ida stands at an elevation of 2,456 meters. While the *Iliad* more frequently references the Mount Ida near Troy, sources indicate that the Cretan Ida is also mentioned in the epic. It holds a significant place in Greek mythology as the birthplace of Zeus.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located on the Chalcidice peninsula in northern Greece, Mount Athos has a height of 2,033 meters. Homer mentions this mountain in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Mount Ida (Turkey):** Situated near the ancient city of Troy (the Troad), this mountain, also known as Kaz Dağı, has a height of about 1,774 meters. It is a prominent location in the *Iliad*, often used by the gods to watch the events of the war.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari/Saos):** The highest point on the island of Samothrace reaches an elevation of 1,611 meters.
