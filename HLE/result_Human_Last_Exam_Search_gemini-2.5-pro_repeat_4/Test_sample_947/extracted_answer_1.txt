The expression for the magnetic field `H = (H_x, H_z)` for an applied field `H_a > H_0` and at a large distance from the stack (`|x| >> a`) is given by:

*   **x-component:**
    `H_x(x,z) = - ( (π^3 H_0 w^2) / D^2 ) * exp(-2π|x|/D) * sgn(x) * sin(2πz/D)`

*   **z-component:**
    `H_z(x,z) = H_a + ( (π^3 H_0 w^2) / D^2 ) * exp(-2π|x|/D) * cos(2πz/D)`

where:
*   `H_a` is the applied magnetic field in the z-direction.
*   `H_0` is the characteristic field, defined as `J_c * d / π`.
*   `2w` is the width of each superconducting strip.
*   `D` is the stacking interval along the z-axis.
*   `J_c` is the critical current density.
*   `d` is the thickness of each strip.
*   `sgn(x)` is the sign function, which is `+1` for `x > 0` and `-1` for `x < 0`.
