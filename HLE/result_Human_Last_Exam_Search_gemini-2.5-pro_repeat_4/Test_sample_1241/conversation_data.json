    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady-state probabilities, denoted as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are constant values that the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach as time $t$ goes to infinity. These are found by setting the time derivatives in the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations to zero.\n\nThe provided system of equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nwith the constraint:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\n\nFor a standard continuous-time Markov process, the sum of the derivatives of the probabilities over all states must be zero to conserve total probability. Summing the given differential equations reveals that $\\frac{d}{dt}\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. This is not zero, which contradicts the condition that the total probability is constant and equal to 1. This indicates a likely typographical error in the second equation. In a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the term representing the flow from state 0 to state 1 in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should be positive, i.e., $+\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$.\n\nAssuming this correction, the proper system for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_i$ (where $P_i'(t) = 0$) becomes:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2. $0 = +\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4. $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n5. $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\nThe given parameter values are:\n*   $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n*   $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n*   $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n*   $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n*   $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n*   $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nWe can now solve this system of linear equations.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 \\pi_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2$\n$0.4 \\pi_1 = 0.4 \\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\nTherefore, we have $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650}{19}\\right) \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) \\pi_1 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) \\pi_1 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{707}{19} \\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}\n$$\n\nWith the value of $\\pi_1$, we can find $\\pi_0$:\n$$\n\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n$$\n\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}\n$$\n\nThis fraction is approximately 0.94625.\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
