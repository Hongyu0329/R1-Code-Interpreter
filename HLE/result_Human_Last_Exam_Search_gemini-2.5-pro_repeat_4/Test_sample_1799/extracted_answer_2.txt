It is not definitively true that the second postulate is superfluous. Its derivability from the first depends on whether Maxwell's equations are assumed as part of the "laws of physics" in the first postulate. From a more fundamental perspective that derives spacetime structure from basic principles, an independent second postulate (or an equivalent assumption about a universal speed limit) is necessary.
