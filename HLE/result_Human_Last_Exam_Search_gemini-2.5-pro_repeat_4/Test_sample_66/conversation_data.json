    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we first need to understand the flag's design and how it translates into a matrix.\n\n### Flag Structure and Matrix Representation\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. This canton is charged with a red couped cross, sometimes specified as a Greek cross. \"Couped\" means that the arms of the cross do not extend to the edges of the canton.\n\nLet the matrix representing the flag be denoted by `A`. The pixels of the flag are assigned values as follows:\n*   Red pixels = `a`\n*   White pixels = `b`\n\nThe matrix `A` can be represented as a block matrix:\n\n```\nA = [ C  R₁ ]\n    [ R₂ R₃ ]\n```\n\nWhere:\n*   `C` is the submatrix representing the white canton with the red cross.\n*   `R₁`, `R₂`, and `R₃` are submatrices representing the main red field. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n\n### Rank Analysis\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns), which is equivalent to the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns). We can use row and column operations to simplify the matrix `A` without changing its rank.\n\nLet's assume `a` and `b` are chosen to maximize the rank. This will be the case when `a ≠ b`, `a ≠ 0`, and `b ≠ 0`.\n\n1.  **Simplifying the Red Field:** The rows of the block `[R₂ R₃]` are all identical, consisting entirely of the value `a`. Similarly, the columns of the block `[R₁; R₃]` are identical. We can perform row operations to simplify the matrix. Let's subtract a row from the red field (any row with index greater than the height of the canton) from all other rows of the matrix.\n\n    *   All rows within the red field (except for the one used for subtraction) will become zero vectors. This reduces the contribution of the `M-m` rows of the red field to the rank to just 1 (assuming `a ≠ 0`).\n    *   A row `i` that passes through the canton will be transformed. The original row is `[row_i(C), a, a, ..., a]`. After subtracting the all-`a` row, it becomes `[row_i(C) - a, 0, 0, ..., 0]`.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Transformed Matrix:** After these operations, the rank of the matrix `A` is `1 + rank(C')`, where `C'` is the matrix derived from the canton `C` by subtracting `a` from each of its elements. The `1` comes from the single remaining linearly independent row representing the red field. This is valid because the rows derived from the canton have zeros in the columns where the red-field row has non-zero `a` values, ensuring their linear independence.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Canton Matrix `C'`:** The matrix `C'` has entries:\n    *   `a - a = 0` for the pixels of the red cross.\n    *   `b - a` for the pixels of the white background of the canton.\n\n    Let `c = b - a` (which is non-zero since `a ≠ b`). The matrix `C'` consists of a cross shape made of zeros on a background of `c`'s.\n\n4.  **Rank of the Canton Matrix `C'`:** The red cross is formed by a set of rows (the horizontal arm) and a set of columns (the vertical arm). Let `I_h` be the set of row indices for the horizontal arm and `J_v` be the set of column indices for the vertical arm. An entry `C'_{ij}` is zero if `i` is in `I_h` or `j` is in `J_v`, and `c` otherwise.\n\n    All rows of `C'` that are not in the horizontal arm of the cross are identical. Each of these rows has zeros in the columns corresponding to the vertical arm of the cross and `c`'s elsewhere. The rows corresponding to the horizontal arm of the cross are all zero vectors. Therefore, the row space of `C'` is spanned by a single non-zero vector (assuming the canton is not entirely covered by the cross).\n\n    This means that `rank(C') = 1`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximal rank of the matrix `A` is the sum of the ranks from the two independent parts: the red field and the transformed canton.\n\n`rank(A) = 1 (from the red field) + rank(C') = 1 + 1 = 2.`\n\nThis maximum rank of 2 is achieved when `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`.\n*   If `a = b` (and not zero), the entire matrix is constant, and the rank is 1.\n*   If `a = 0` and `b ≠ 0`, the red parts are zero. The rank would then be equal to the rank of the canton matrix `C`, which has `0` for the cross and `b` for the background. As shown above, this matrix has a rank of 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
