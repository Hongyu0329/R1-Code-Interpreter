    "To determine the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset of the integer N = 823564528378596, a multi-step process involving prime factorization and combinatorial principles of partially ordered sets is required.\n\nFirst, the prime factorization of N is essential. The number 823564528378596 can be factored into its prime components as follows:\nN = 2² × 3¹ × 7² × 11¹ × 13¹ × 17¹ × 19¹ × 23¹ × 29¹ × 31¹ × 37¹ × 41¹ × 43¹ × 47¹ × 53¹ × 59¹ × 61¹\n\nThe structure of the divisor poset of an integer is determined by the exponents of its prime factorization. Specifically, the divisor poset of N is a ranked poset, where the rank of a divisor is the sum of the exponents of its prime factors (with multiplicity). The total number of prime factors of N, denoted as Ω(N), is the sum of the exponents in its prime factorization:\nΩ(N) = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19.\n\nThe ranks in this poset range from 0 (for the divisor 1) to 19 (for the number N itself). This means the divisor poset for N has a total of 20 distinct ranks.\n\nA key concept in this context is the **Sperner property**. A poset has the Sperner property if the size of its largest antichain is equal to the size of its largest rank. The divisor poset of any integer possesses a stronger characteristic known as the **strong Sperner property** or is a **strongly Sperner poset**. This implies that for any integer k, the largest union of k antichains is the union of the k largest ranks of the poset.\n\nThe question asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains. Since the divisor poset of N has exactly 20 ranks (from rank 0 to rank 19), the union of the 20 largest antichains corresponds to the union of all 20 ranks. The union of all ranks of a poset is the set of all elements within that poset.\n\nTherefore, the size of the largest union of 20 antichains is equivalent to the total number of divisors of N. The number of divisors, d(N), can be calculated by taking the exponents of the prime factors, adding 1 to each, and multiplying the results.\n\nFor N = 2² × 3¹ × 7² × 11¹ × ... × 61¹, the number of divisors is:\nd(N) = (2+1) × (1+1) × (2+1) × (1+1)¹⁴\nd(N) = 3 × 2 × 3 × 2¹⁴\nd(N) = 18 × 16384\nd(N) = 294,912\n\nThus, the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset of 823564528378596 comprises all of its divisors.\n\n<<<294912>>>"
