The tightest lower bound on the minimax risk \( R_n^* \) that can be proven under the given conditions is:
\[ R_n^* \ge \max_{j \in \{1, \dots, N\}} \left[ \frac{\Phi(\rho(\theta(P_0), \theta(P_j))/2)}{4} A(P_0, P_j)^{2n} \right] \]
where \( A(P_0, P_j) = \int \sqrt{dP_0 dP_j} \) is the Hellinger affinity between the distributions \( P_0 \) and \( P_j \). This bound effectively connects the parameter separation (\(\rho\)), the loss function (\(\Phi\)), the sample size (\(n\)), and the statistical distinguishability of the hypotheses (as measured by the affinity). The term \( P = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N P_j^n \) appears to relate to a specific construction of an alternative hypothesis in a testing framework, and the derived bound is based on the general principle of reducing the estimation problem to a series of binary hypothesis tests, which is a standard method for deriving minimax lower bounds.
