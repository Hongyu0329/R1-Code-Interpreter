    "In the study of finite groups, a subset is called \"product-free\" if it does not contain any three elements *a*, *b*, and *c* (not necessarily distinct) such that *ab* = *c*. A product-free set is said to be \"maximal by inclusion\" (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nResearch by Chimere Anabanti and Sarah Hart has led to a complete classification of all finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3. They proved that any such group must have an order of 24 or less. Their work provides a comprehensive list of these groups.\n\nBased on this complete classification, there are exactly 27 finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3. These groups are:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C₇, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂, C₁₃, C₁₄, C₁₅, C₁₆, C₁₈, C₂₀, C₂₁, C₂₂, C₂₄\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₁₆, D₁₈, D₂₀, D₂₂, D₂₄\n*   **Other Abelian Groups:** C₈ × C₂\n*   **Non-Abelian Groups:**\n    *   Alternating group A₄\n    *   Quaternion group Q₁₆\n    *   Special linear group SL(2,3)\n    *   The group A₄ × C₂\n    *   The semidirect product C₃ ⋊ Q₈\n\n<<<27>>>"
