    "The TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor contains one Cysteine residue.\n\nThe specific location of this residue was determined by first identifying the protein in the UniProt database, a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and functional information. The human GABAAρ1 receptor corresponds to the UniProt entry P24046 (GABRR1_HUMAN).\n\nWithin this database, the transmembrane domains are annotated at the following amino acid positions:\n*   Transmembrane Domain 3 (TM3): 326-346\n*   Transmembrane Domain 4 (TM4): 454-474\n\nThe linker between these two domains is the large intracellular loop spanning from amino acid 347 to 453. Analysis of the amino acid sequence for this specific region reveals the presence of a single Cysteine (C) residue.\n\n<<<1>>>"
