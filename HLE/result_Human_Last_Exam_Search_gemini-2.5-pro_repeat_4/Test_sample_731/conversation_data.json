    "The term \"power subgroup\" is not standard, but in the context of this question, it is interpreted as a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as `SD_512`, has the order `2^n = 512`, which means `n=9`. Its structure is defined by two generators, `r` and `s`, with the relations:\n`r^256 = s^2 = 1` and `srs = r^(2^(9-2) - 1) = r^127`.\n\nTo find the number of cyclic subgroups, we can categorize them based on their generating elements:\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by powers of `r`**: These are the subgroups of the cyclic group `<r>`, which has an order of 256. The number of subgroups in a finite cyclic group of order `m` is equal to the number of divisors of `m` (Ï„(m)). For `<r>`, the order is `256 = 2^8`. The number of divisors is `8 + 1 = 9`. These 9 subgroups are distinct and are all contained within `<r>`.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form `sr^i`**: These elements are not in the subgroup `<r>`. We must first determine their orders.\n    *   The order of an element `sr^i` is 2 if `i` is an even number. There are 128 even numbers for `i` between 0 and 255. Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n    *   The order of an element `sr^i` is 4 if `i` is an odd number. There are 128 odd numbers for `i` between 0 and 255. An element `g = sr^i` and its cube `g^3 = sr^(i+128)` generate the same cyclic subgroup of order 4. This means the 128 generators of order 4 form pairs, resulting in `128 / 2 = 64` distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nNone of the subgroups generated by elements of the form `sr^i` are the same as those generated by powers of `r` (except for the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element, which is part of every cyclic subgroup's count).\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from each category:\n*   Subgroups from `<r>`: 9\n*   Subgroups of order 2 from `s<r>`: 128\n*   Subgroups of order 4 from `s<r>`: 64\n\nTotal = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\nThis result is confirmed by a known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in a semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}`, which is `n + 3 * 2^(n-3)`. For `n=9`, this gives `9 + 3 * 2^(9-3) = 9 + 3 * 2^6 = 9 + 3 * 64 = 9 + 192 = 201`.\n\n<<<201>>>"
