The first area Charles needs to adjust is the strictness of his diet. He has adopted a highly restrictive plan by limiting animal protein, fat, and carbohydrates all at once while starting a new exercise routine and managing a travel-heavy job. This approach is likely causing his struggles. He should initially focus on the "whole foods" principle, gradually reducing processed items and ensuring he consumes enough energy from all macronutrient groups to sustain his new active lifestyle and make the diet more manageable, especially while traveling.
