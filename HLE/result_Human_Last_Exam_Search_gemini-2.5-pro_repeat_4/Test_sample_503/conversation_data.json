    "An internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$ (viewed as a locally posetal 2-category) is a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, such that $L$ is the left adjoint to $R$. This is equivalent to the condition that for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$, we have $L(x) \\le y$ if and only if $x \\le R(y)$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint $L$ or its right adjoint $R$. Therefore, counting the number of possible adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of possible left adjoint maps from $[m]$ to $[n]$.\n\nFor a monotone map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must have a corresponding right adjoint $R: [n] \\to [m]$. The right adjoint is defined by the formula $R(y) = \\max\\{x \\in [m] \\mid L(x) \\le y\\}$. For $R(y)$ to be well-defined for all $y \\in [n]$, the set $\\{x \\in [m] \\mid L(x) \\le y\\}$ must have a maximum element. Since $[m]$ is a finite chain, this is equivalent to the set being non-empty. For this set to be non-empty for all $y \\in [n]$, it must be non-empty for the smallest element, $y=0$. This requires that there is an $x \\in [m]$ such that $L(x) \\le 0$, which implies $L(x)=0$. As $L$ is order-preserving, this is only possible if $L(0)=0$. Conversely, if $L(0)=0$, the set is always non-empty, and $L$ is a left adjoint.\n\nThus, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ that satisfy the condition $L(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$. The values must be in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nWith the condition $L(0)=0$, we are looking for the number of non-decreasing sequences of the form:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis means we only need to determine the values of $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$, which must form a non-decreasing sequence of 23 integers chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 numbers from a set of $37+1=38$ possibilities with replacement, and the order is fixed by the non-decreasing condition. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{k+r-1}{r} $$\nHere, we are choosing $r=23$ values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$, and the number of possible values is $k=38$ (the integers from 0 to 37). The number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThis can also be expressed using a different variant of the stars and bars formula, $\\binom{n+r}{r}$, where we are choosing $r$ items from $n+1$ categories. In our problem, this corresponds to choosing $r=m=23$ values from $n+1=38$ possibilities, which gives $\\binom{(n+1)+m-1}{m} = \\binom{n+m}{m} = \\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nCalculating the value of the binomial coefficient:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} = 459,383,137,458,436,900 $$\n\n<<<459383137458436900>>>"
