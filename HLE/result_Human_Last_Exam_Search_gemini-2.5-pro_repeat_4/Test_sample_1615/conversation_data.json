    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. The question asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of $G$, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$, for any non-complete graph with 12345 vertices.\n\nFirst, let's establish some basic principles of graph coloring:\n*   A proper coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   The chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a proper coloring of $G$.\n*   For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique color to each vertex.\n*   A complete graph, denoted $K_n$, is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. To properly color a complete graph $K_n$, every vertex must receive a different color, so its chromatic number is $n$.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph. This is a key piece of information. If a graph is not complete, it means there exists at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color. This simple fact immediately implies that we will not need $n$ colors. By assigning $u$ and $v$ the same color and all other $n-2$ vertices their own unique colors, we can always color the graph with $n-1$ colors. Therefore, for any non-complete graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number is at most $n-1$.\n\nNow, we must determine if this upper bound of $n-1$ is achievable. We need to find if there exists a non-complete graph with $n=12345$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1=12344$ colors.\n\nConsider the graph constructed by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge. Let the removed edge be between vertices $u$ and $v$. This new graph, let's call it $G'$, is not a complete graph.\n*   In $G'$, the vertices $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, so they can be given the same color.\n*   All other 12343 vertices are still connected to each other, forming a clique ($K_{12343}$). Furthermore, all of these 12343 vertices are connected to both $u$ and $v$.\n*   This means that each of these 12343 vertices must have a color that is different from the color assigned to $u$ and $v$, and also different from each other.\n*   Therefore, we need one color for the pair $\\{u, v\\}$ and 12343 additional, distinct colors for the other 12343 vertices.\n*   This gives a total of $1 + 12343 = 12344$ colors.\n\nThus, the chromatic number of this graph $G'$ is 12344. Since we have shown that no non-complete graph on 12345 vertices can have a chromatic number greater than 12344, and we have found a graph that requires exactly 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nThis result is also consistent with Brooks's Theorem, which states that for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree of the graph, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. In our example graph $G' = K_{12345} - \\text{edge}$, the maximum degree is 12344. Brooks's Theorem implies $\\chi(G') \\le 12344$, which aligns with our finding.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
