    "Zero 13C-labeled CO2 molecules will be released during glycolysis.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one six-carbon molecule of glucose into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. This process does not produce any carbon dioxide (CO2). All six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are present in the two pyruvate molecules at the end of the pathway.\n\nThe release of CO2 from the breakdown of glucose occurs in subsequent metabolic pathways:\n1.  **Pyruvate Oxidation (or Pyruvate Decarboxylation):** The two pyruvate molecules are converted into two molecules of acetyl-CoA. This step releases two molecules of CO2.\n2.  **The Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):** The two acetyl-CoA molecules enter this cycle and are further oxidized, releasing four more molecules of CO2.\n\nIn the specific case of 1,4-13C glucose, the labeled carbons (C1 and C6) end up on the methyl carbon (C3) of the two pyruvate molecules. The CO2 released during pyruvate oxidation comes from the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate, which originates from carbons 3 and 4 of the initial glucose molecule. Therefore, even in the step immediately following glycolysis, the labeled carbons are not released as CO2. They would eventually be released in later turns of the Citric Acid Cycle.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the process of glycolysis, during which no CO2 is produced at all.\n\n<<<0>>>"
