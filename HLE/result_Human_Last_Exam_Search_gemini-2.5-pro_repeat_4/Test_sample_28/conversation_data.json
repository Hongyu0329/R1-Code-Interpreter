    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a hypothesis class is a measure of its complexity, defined as the size of the largest set of points that the class can \"shatter\". A set of points is shattered if, for every possible binary labeling of those points, there exists a hypothesis in the class that can produce that labeling.\n\nThe hypothesis class in question is $H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$, where the domain $X$ has size $T$ and $z$ is a positive integer. Each function in this class assigns the label '1' to exactly $z$ elements of the domain.\n\nTo determine the VC dimension of $H_{z-ones}$, we need to find the maximum size of a set $S \\subseteq X$ that can be shattered by this class.\n\n### Derivation\n\nLet $d$ be the VC dimension of $H_{z-ones}$. We will first establish an upper bound for $d$ and then show that this bound is achievable.\n\n#### 1. Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nLet's assume a set $S \\subseteq X$ with size $m$ can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. This implies that for any possible labeling of the points in $S$, there is a corresponding hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nConsider a specific labeling on $S$. This labeling can be represented by a subset $S_1 \\subseteq S$, where points in $S_1$ are assigned the label '1' and points in $S \\setminus S_1$ are assigned the label '0'. Let the number of points labeled '1' be $k = |S_1|$.\n\nFor this labeling to be realized by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The hypothesis $h$ must match the labeling on $S$, meaning $h(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in S_1$ and $h(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in S \\setminus S_1$.\n2.  The hypothesis $h$ must belong to the class $H_{z-ones}$, which means it must assign the label '1' to a total of exactly $z$ points in the entire domain $X$.\n\nFrom the first condition, we know that the $k$ points in $S_1$ must be mapped to '1'. To satisfy the second condition, the hypothesis must map an additional $z-k$ points from outside of $S$ (i.e., from $X \\setminus S$) to '1'.\n\nThe number of points available in $X \\setminus S$ is $T-m$. Therefore, the number of additional points we need to select, which is $z-k$, must be between 0 and the total number of available points, $T-m$. This gives us the inequality:\n$0 \\le z-k \\le T-m$\n\nSince the set $S$ is shattered, this inequality must hold for *every* possible labeling of $S$. The number of points labeled '1', $k$, can be any integer from $0$ to $m$. We must therefore find the constraints on $m$ for which the inequality holds for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$.\n\nThis leads to two conditions on $m$:\n1.  **From $z-k \\ge 0$:** This is equivalent to $k \\le z$. This must hold for all possible values of $k$. Since the maximum value of $k$ is $m$, we must have $m \\le z$.\n2.  **From $z-k \\le T-m$:** This is equivalent to $m+k \\le T+z-k \\iff m-T+z \\le k$. This must hold for all possible values of $k$. Since the minimum value of $k$ is $0$, we must have $m - (T-z) \\le 0$, which simplifies to $m \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $m$ to be shattered, both conditions must be satisfied. Thus, $m$ must be less than or equal to both $z$ and $T-z$. This means $m \\le \\min(z, T-z)$. The VC dimension, being the size of the largest shatterable set, is therefore bounded by this value:\n$d \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n#### 2. Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nNow, we will demonstrate that a set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z)$ can indeed be shattered.\nLet $m = \\min(z, T-z)$, and let $S$ be any subset of $X$ with $|S| = m$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary labeling on $S$, defined by a subset $S_1 \\subseteq S$ of points to be labeled '1'. Let $|S_1| = k$, where $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $m$. We need to show that there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that generates this labeling.\n\nWe can construct such a hypothesis by defining the set of points it maps to '1'. This set must contain $S_1$. To ensure the hypothesis is in $H_{z-ones}$, it must map a total of $z$ points to '1'. Thus, we need to select an additional $z-k$ points from the set $X \\setminus S$ to also map to '1'.\n\nThis construction is possible if and only if we can select $z-k$ points from the $T-m$ points in $X \\setminus S$. This requires that $0 \\le z-k \\le T-m$. We must verify this holds for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, given our choice of $m = \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n1.  **Check $k \\le z$:** Since $k \\le m$ and we chose $m = \\min(z, T-z)$, we have $m \\le z$. Therefore, $k \\le z$ is always true.\n2.  **Check $k \\ge m - (T-z)$:** Since $k \\ge 0$, this inequality is satisfied if $m - (T-z) \\le 0$, which is $m \\le T-z$. By our choice of $m = \\min(z, T-z)$, this condition is also always true.\n\nSince both conditions hold for any labeling of the set $S$ (i.e., for any $k$), we can always construct a valid hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$. This proves that any set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\n\nThis establishes the lower bound for the VC dimension:\n$d \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we find that the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
