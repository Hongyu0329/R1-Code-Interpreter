    "Let the given interval be $[-L, L]$, where $L = 1 - 10^{-M}$. The condition $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ implies that for a chosen starting point $x_0$, the subsequent points are determined by a sequence of signs $\\sigma_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i a_i$.\n\nFor a valid sequence of $x_i$ to exist, there must be a choice of $x_0 \\in [-L, L]$ and a sequence of signs $\\{\\sigma_i\\}$ such that for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 100000\\}$, we have $x_k \\in [-L, L]$. Let $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i a_i$ (with $S_0 = 0$). The condition is that for all $k$, $-L \\le x_0 + S_k \\le L$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding an $x_0$ such that $-L - \\min_k S_k \\le x_0 \\le L - \\max_k S_k$. Such an $x_0$ exists if and only if $-L - \\min_k S_k \\le L - \\max_k S_k$, which simplifies to:\n$\\max_k S_k - \\min_k S_k \\le 2L$.\n\nThis inequality must hold for some choice of signs $\\{\\sigma_i\\}$. The problem states that a valid sequence of $x_i$ must exist for *any* sequence of $a_i \\in$. Therefore, for any given sequence $\\{a_i\\}$, we can choose the signs $\\{\\sigma_i\\}$ to minimize the span $(\\max_k S_k - \\min_k S_k)$. Let $W(a_1, \\dots, a_N)$ be this minimum possible span for a given sequence of $a_i$. The condition on $L$ is that for any sequence $\\{a_i\\}$, we must have $W(a_1, \\dots, a_N) \\le 2L$.\n\nThis means that $2L$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum possible value that $W(a_1, \\dots, a_N)$ can take over all possible sequences of $a_i$. Let $\\mathcal{W}_N = \\max_{\\{a_i\\} \\subseteq} W(a_1, \\dots, a_N)$. The condition is $2L \\ge \\mathcal{W}_N$.\n\nWe need to find the value of $\\mathcal{W}_N$ for $N=100000$. This is a known problem in discrepancy theory, and this specific question is a variation of a mathematical competition problem (KÃ¶MaL A. 642).\n\nTo find a lower bound for $\\mathcal{W}_N$, we can construct a \"worst-case\" sequence $\\{a_i\\}$. Consider the sequence with $N=100000$:\n$a_1 = 1$, and $a_i = 1 - \\frac{1}{N-1}$ for $i=2, 3, \\dots, N$.\n\nLet's analyze the minimal span for this sequence. We need to choose the signs $\\sigma_i$ to minimize the range of the partial sums $S_k$.\nLet's try a specific path of signs. Choose $\\sigma_1=1$. Then $S_1 = 1$. For $k \\ge 2$, choose the signs to bring the sum towards zero.\n$S_2 = S_1 - a_2 = 1 - (1 - \\frac{1}{N-1}) = \\frac{1}{N-1}$.\n$S_3 = S_2 - a_3 = \\frac{1}{N-1} - (1 - \\frac{1}{N-1}) = \\frac{2}{N-1} - 1$.\n$S_4 = S_3 + a_4 = (\\frac{2}{N-1} - 1) + (1 - \\frac{1}{N-1}) = \\frac{1}{N-1}$.\nFor $k \\ge 2$, the sums alternate between $\\frac{1}{N-1}$ and $\\frac{2}{N-1} - 1$.\nThe set of all partial sums for this path is $\\{0, 1, \\frac{1}{N-1}, \\frac{2}{N-1} - 1\\}$.\nThe maximum value is $1$. The minimum value is $\\frac{2}{N-1} - 1$.\nThe span for this path is $1 - (\\frac{2}{N-1} - 1) = 2 - \\frac{2}{N-1}$.\n\nAnother path starts with $\\sigma_1=1, \\sigma_2=1$.\n$S_1 = 1$.\n$S_2 = 1 + (1 - \\frac{1}{N-1}) = 2 - \\frac{1}{N-1}$.\nThe span is at least $S_2 - S_0 = 2 - \\frac{1}{N-1}$.\nComparing the two paths, the first one gives a smaller span of $2 - \\frac{2}{N-1}$. It can be shown that this is indeed the minimal span for this sequence.\n\nThus, we have a lower bound for the maximum possible span: $\\mathcal{W}_N \\ge 2 - \\frac{2}{N-1}$.\nIt has been established that this is, in fact, the maximum possible span for $N \\ge 2$. So, $\\mathcal{W}_N = 2 - \\frac{2}{N-1}$.\n\nFor $N=100000$, we have $\\mathcal{W}_{100000} = 2 - \\frac{2}{99999}$.\nThe condition on $L$ is $2L \\ge 2 - \\frac{2}{99999}$, which simplifies to $L \\ge 1 - \\frac{1}{99999}$.\n\nSubstituting $L=1-10^{-M}$:\n$1 - 10^{-M} \\ge 1 - \\frac{1}{99999}$\n$-10^{-M} \\ge -\\frac{1}{99999}$\n$10^{-M} \\le \\frac{1}{99999}$\nTaking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$-M \\le \\log_{10}(\\frac{1}{99999})$\n$-M \\le -\\log_{10}(99999)$\n$M \\ge \\log_{10}(99999)$\n\nTo find the smallest integer $M$ satisfying this, we evaluate $\\log_{10}(99999)$:\n$\\log_{10}(10000) = 4$\n$\\log_{10}(100000) = 5$\nSince $10000 < 99999 < 100000$, we have $4 < \\log_{10}(99999) < 5$.\nNumerically, $\\log_{10}(99999) \\approx 4.99999565$.\nSo, we need $M \\ge 4.99999565$. As $M$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $M$ is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
