    "Let $C$ be a genus 3 Riemann surface and $X$ be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as $X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C)$. We want to determine the smallest and the largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X$, denoted by $\\rho(X)$.\n\nThe Néron-Severi group, $NS(X)$, is the group of divisors on $X$ modulo algebraic equivalence, and its rank $\\rho(X)$ is known as the Picard number. For the symmetric power of a curve, this rank is closely related to the properties of the curve's Jacobian variety.\n\n### Relation between $\\rho(\\text{Sym}^d(C))$ and $\\rho(J(C))$\n\nFor a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$ and an integer $d \\ge g$, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the $d$-th symmetric power $\\text{Sym}^d(C)$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\rho(\\text{Sym}^d(C)) = 1 + \\rho(J(C)) $$\nwhere $J(C)$ is the Jacobian variety of $C$.\n\nIn the given problem, the genus is $g=3$ and the symmetric power is $d=15$. Since $15 \\ge 3$, this formula applies. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, $\\rho(J(C))$.\n\n### Minimum Rank of $NS(J(C))$\n\nFor a \"general\" curve $C$ of genus $g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has the minimal possible Néron-Severi rank. A general curve is one whose Jacobian has an endomorphism ring that is as small as possible, which is just the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Néron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is generated by the class of the theta divisor, and its rank is 1.\n\nThus, the minimum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve is:\n$$ \\min \\rho(J(C)) = 1 $$\n\n### Maximum Rank of $NS(J(C))$\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of a complex abelian variety of dimension $g$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$, which for a Jacobian is $g^2$. For a genus 3 curve, this upper bound is $3^2 = 9$.\n\nThis maximum rank is achieved for special curves known as curves with complex multiplication (CM). These are curves whose Jacobians have a larger ring of endomorphisms. A prominent example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian achieves this maximal Picard number is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$. The Jacobian of this curve is isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. For such abelian varieties, it is known that the rank of the Néron-Severi group equals the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$, which is 9.\n\nThus, the maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve is:\n$$ \\max \\rho(J(C)) = 9 $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing the formula connecting the Picard numbers, we can now find the smallest and largest possible ranks for $NS(X)$.\n\n**Smallest Rank:**\nThe smallest possible rank of $NS(X)$ corresponds to the case where $C$ is a general curve, so $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n$$ \\rho_{\\min}(X) = 1 + \\min \\rho(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nFor a general curve of genus $g \\ge 2$, it is a known result that for $d \\ge g$, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $\\text{Sym}^d(C)$ is 2.\n\n**Largest Rank:**\nThe largest possible rank of $NS(X)$ corresponds to the case where $C$ is a curve with complex multiplication, such as the Fermat quartic, where $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n$$ \\rho_{\\max}(X) = 1 + \\max \\rho(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10 $$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X$ is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
