    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nThe specialized terminology he developed is known as **\"seminal reasons\"** (in Latin, *rationes seminales* or *causales rationes*).\n\nAugustine proposed that God created everything at the beginning, but some things were created in a latent, seed-like state. These \"seminal reasons\" are hidden potentialities embedded within the fabric of creation. According to this view, what appear to be changes or new developments in the natural order are actually the unfolding or \"actualization\" of these pre-ordained principles over time, as willed by God.\n\nThis theological framework allowed Augustine to explain events that seem to contravene the ordinary course of nature without suggesting that God violates his own established order.\n\n*   **Applicability to the Virgin Birth**: The virgin birth of Jesus is understood not as a violation of natural law, but as a unique and miraculous actualization of a \"seminal reason\" by the power of God. It was a notable miracle intended to signify that Jesus' members—believers—would be born of a virgin Church through the Spirit. In this view, God did not break the rules of nature but rather brought forth a potentiality that He had embedded within it from the beginning.\n\n*   **Applicability to the Fall**: Augustine's concept also addresses potential changes in natural laws after the Fall of Man. He suggested that God could have embedded \"seminal reasons\" in creation that would only come to fruition after the Fall, accounting for changes in human nature and the natural world, such as pain in childbirth and the need to toil for food. This explains how human nature could change from a state of being \"able not to sin\" (*posse non peccare*) before the Fall to \"not able not to sin\" (*non posse non peccare*) after it, as a result of a corruption that was seminally present in Adam.\n\nIn essence, Augustine's doctrine of \"seminal reasons\" provides a sophisticated theological language for understanding both unique miraculous events and fundamental shifts in the operation of the natural world as part of God's single, all-encompassing creative and providential plan.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
