    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. These conditions ensure that iterative sequences defined by the functions F, G, and H converge to a fixed point. The concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the tripled fixed point and an extension of the FG-coupled fixed point.\n\nThe primary conditions are as follows:\n\n### 1. The Nature of the Spaces\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. Let (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>, d<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>, d<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>, d<sub>Z</sub>) be partially ordered complete metric spaces. The product space X × Y × Z is endowed with a partial order defined as:\nFor (x, y, z), (u, v, w) ∈ X × Y × Z,\n(x, y, z) ≤ (u, v, w) if and only if x ≤<sub>X</sub> u, y ≥<sub>Y</sub> v, and z ≤<sub>Z</sub> w.\n\n### 2. Mixed Monotone Property\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This means that the functions are monotone (either non-decreasing or non-increasing) in each of their arguments. For the given function signatures, a typical mixed monotone property would be defined as follows:\n\n*   **For F: X × Y × Z → X:**\n    *   F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments.\n    *   F is non-increasing in its second argument.\n    This means for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n    *   x₁ ≤<sub>X</sub> x₂ ⇒ F(x₁, y, z) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x₂, y, z)\n    *   y₁ ≤<sub>Y</sub> y₂ ⇒ F(x, y₁, z) ≥<sub>X</sub> F(x, y₂, z)\n    *   z₁ ≤<sub>Z</sub> z₂ ⇒ F(x, y, z₁) ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x, y, z₂)\n\n*   **For G: Y × X × Y → Y:**\n    *   G is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments.\n    *   G is non-increasing in its second argument.\n\n*   **For H: Z × Y × X → Z:**\n    *   H is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments.\n    *   H is non-increasing in its second argument.\n\n### 3. Contractive Condition\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive-type condition. This is a crucial requirement that ensures the iterative sequences are Cauchy sequences and thus converge. A common form of this condition is:\n\nd<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k(d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w))\n\nfor all x, u ∈ X; y, v ∈ Y; z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w. Here, k is a constant such that 0 ≤ k < 1/3.\n\n### 4. Initial Point and Continuity\nThere must exist an initial point that satisfies a certain relation, and the functions should ideally be continuous.\n\n*   **Existence of an Initial Point**: There exist points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, and z₀ ∈ Z such that:\n    *   x₀ ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    *   y₀ ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    *   z₀ ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n*   **Continuity**: The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n\nAlternatively, the continuity condition can be replaced by a property of the space. For instance, if the space has the property that for any non-decreasing sequence {x<sub>n</sub>} that converges to x, we have x<sub>n</sub> ≤ x for all n, and for any non-increasing sequence {y<sub>n</sub>} that converges to y, we have y<sub>n</sub> ≥ y for all n, then the existence of a tripled fixed point can still be guaranteed without assuming the continuity of F, G, and H.\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed if the spaces are partially ordered complete metric spaces, the functions possess the mixed monotone property and satisfy a contractive condition, and there is a suitable initial point, along with the continuity of the functions or a specific property of the spaces.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe main conditions are:\n1.  **Spaces**: (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>, d<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>, d<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>, d<sub>Z</sub>) are partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The functions F, G, and H have a mixed monotone property. For example, F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. Similar properties are required for G and H.\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: A contractive inequality holds, such as:\n    d<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k(d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w))\n    for all x ≥ u, y ≤ v, z ≥ w, with 0 ≤ k < 1/3.\n4.  **Initial Point and Continuity**: There exists an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) such that x₀ ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z₀, y₀, x₀). Additionally, the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the spaces satisfy certain sequential properties.>>>"
