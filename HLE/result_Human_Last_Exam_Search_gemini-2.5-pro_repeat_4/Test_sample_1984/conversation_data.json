    "To find the number of stable equilibrium points, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the given ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions, which occur when $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of each equilibrium point. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is considered stable if solutions that start near $x^*$ stay near $x^*$ for all future time. It is asymptotically stable if solutions that start near $x^*$ not only stay near but also converge to $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$. In the context of autonomous differential equations, an equilibrium point is often classified as stable if it is asymptotically stable. An equilibrium point that is not stable is called unstable. A semi-stable equilibrium point is one where solutions on one side of the point converge to it, while on the other side they move away, and it is considered unstable.\n\nWe can use the derivative of $f(x)$ to analyze the stability. The derivative is:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by the sign of $f'(x^*)$:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable (asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is needed.\n\nLet's test our equilibrium points:\n\n1.  For the equilibrium point **x = 0**:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium point **x = 1**:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, we must use another method. We can analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive, so $f(x) = -(\\text{pos})(\\text{pos}) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ will decrease towards 1.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive, so $f(x) = -(\\text{pos})(\\text{pos}) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ will decrease, moving away from 1 towards 0.\n    Since solutions starting on one side of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is a semi-stable equilibrium point, which is classified as unstable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. The number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
