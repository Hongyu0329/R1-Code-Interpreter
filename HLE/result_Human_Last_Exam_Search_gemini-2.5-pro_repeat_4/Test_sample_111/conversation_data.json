    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At the time of her death, she was at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\nIn 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer, then an esquire in the king's court, was abroad on diplomatic missions. Records indicate that he may have attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti in Milan, which would place him in Italy that year. Another source states he traveled to the continent, possibly France, on the king's service in 1368. The following year, 1369, he was on military service in France with John of Gaunt's army.\n\nGiven that multiple sources confirm Chaucer was traveling on the continent for diplomatic duties in 1368, and a specific potential destination mentioned for that year is Milan, Italy, this is the most likely location.\n\n<<<A>>>"
