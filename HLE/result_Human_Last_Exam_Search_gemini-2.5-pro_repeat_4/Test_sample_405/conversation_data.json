    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus exhibit a surprising variety of colors. At least five distinct colors can be observed among its different forms: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a waxy, translucent solid that is colorless when pure. However, it often appears yellow due to impurities or degradation, and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus has a characteristic deep red color and is found in a powdery texture. A related form, fibrous red phosphorus, has been described as orange-red. Another variation has been identified as red/brown.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, can be produced by annealing red phosphorus and has a red-purple hue.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most stable form of the element and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite.\n\nA more recently discovered allotrope is blue phosphorus, which exists as a two-dimensional material.\n\nIn summary, the observed colors in pure phosphorus allotropes are:\n*   White (can appear yellow)\n*   Red\n*   Violet (or red/purple)\n*   Black\n*   Blue\n\nThis brings the total number of observable colors in pure phosphorus allotropes to five, with some variations in shades like orange-red and red/brown also being reported.\n\n<<<5>>>"
