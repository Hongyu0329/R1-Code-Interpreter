    "John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* mentions seven historical saints by name. These figures are venerated in various Christian traditions.\n\nThe historical saints named in the poem are:\n\n*   **Adam and Eve:** The first man and woman are considered saints in some Christian traditions, including the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, which celebrate their feast day on December 24.\n*   **The Archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael:** These three archangels are also venerated as saints within the Catholic and Orthodox traditions. Michael and Gabriel are prominent characters in the poem, interacting with Adam and Eve and participating in the war in Heaven. Raphael is sent to warn Adam about Satan.\n*   **Enoch and Elijah:** These two Old Testament prophets are considered saints who were taken into heaven without experiencing death. Milton refers to \"translated saints\" in the poem, which is an allusion to figures like Enoch and Elijah.\n\nWhile other angelic beings like Uriel and Abdiel are named, their veneration as saints is not as established as that of Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Other named figures are either divine beings (God the Father, God the Son), fallen angels (Satan, Beelzebub), or allegorical figures (Sin and Death).\n\n<<<7>>>"
