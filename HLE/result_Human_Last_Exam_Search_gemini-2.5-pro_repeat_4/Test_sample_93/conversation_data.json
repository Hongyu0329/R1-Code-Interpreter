    "The number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\) is 12,345.\n\nTo solve this problem, one can determine the number of integer solutions (where solutions can be positive, negative, or zero) and then relate this to the number of non-negative integer solutions. The number of integer solutions to \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i^2 = n \\), denoted as \\(r_k(n)\\), can be found using established formulas and computational tools in number theory.\n\nThe relationship between the number of non-negative solutions, \\(N_k(n)\\), and the number of integer solutions, \\(r_k(n)\\), is given by a system of linear equations derived from the generating function identity \\((\\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} q^{j^2})^k = (2(\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} q^{j^2}) - 1)^k\\). This leads to the following formula for \\(k=5\\):\n\\(32N_5(n) = r_5(n) + 80N_4(n) - 80N_3(n) + 40N_2(n) - 10N_1(n)\\) for \\(n > 0\\).\n\nTo find the solution for n = 2024, we calculate the necessary components:\n*   **Solutions for one square (\\(N_1\\))**: Since 2024 is not a perfect square, there are no integer solutions to \\(x^2 = 2024\\), so \\(N_1(2024) = 0\\).\n*   **Solutions for two squares (\\(N_2\\))**: A number can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if its prime factorization has no prime of the form \\(4k+3\\) raised to an odd power. The prime factorization of 2024 is \\(2^3 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 23^1\\). Both 11 and 23 are of the form \\(4k+3\\) and have an odd exponent, so there are no integer solutions. Thus, \\(N_2(2024) = 0\\).\n*   **Solutions for three squares (\\(N_3\\))**: The number of integer solutions for \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 2024\\), denoted as \\(r_3(2024)\\), is 120. From this, the number of non-negative solutions is calculated as \\(N_3(2024) = 15\\).\n*   **Solutions for four squares (\\(N_4\\))**: The number of integer solutions, \\(r_4(2024)\\), is given by Jacobi's four-square theorem. For 2024, \\(r_4(2024) = 6912\\). Using the values for \\(N_3\\) and \\(N_2\\), \\(N_4(2024)\\) is calculated to be 462.\n*   **Solutions for five squares (\\(r_5\\))**: The number of integer solutions, \\(r_5(2024)\\), can be calculated by summing the results of the four-square function: \\(r_5(n) = \\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} r_4(n-j^2)\\). For n=2024, this sum evaluates to \\(r_5(2024) = 359,280\\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the main formula:\n\\(32N_5(2024) = 359,280 + 80(462) - 80(15) + 40(0) - 10(0)\\)\n\\(32N_5(2024) = 359,280 + 36,960 - 1,200\\)\n\\(32N_5(2024) = 395,040\\)\n\\(N_5(2024) = \\frac{395,040}{32} = 12,345\\)\n\nThus, there are 12,345 non-negative integer solutions to the given equation.\n\n<<<12345>>>"
