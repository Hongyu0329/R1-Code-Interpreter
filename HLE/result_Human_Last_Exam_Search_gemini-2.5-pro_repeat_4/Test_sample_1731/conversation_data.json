    "Large deviation theorems, such as the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics. They allow for the derivation of the equilibrium properties of physical systems by identifying the most probable macroscopic states. For the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas), these theorems can be used to determine the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy.\n\n### Conceptual Framework\n\nA photon gas in a cavity in thermal equilibrium is a system of non-interacting, indistinguishable bosons. A key characteristic of this system is that the number of photons is not conserved, as they can be emitted and absorbed by the walls of the cavity. This leads to a chemical potential of zero (μ=0) at thermodynamic equilibrium. The equilibrium state is the macroscopic configuration (the distribution of photons across energy levels) that has the highest probability of occurring.\n\n### Role of the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is concerned with the probability of an empirical distribution of a set of random variables deviating from a true underlying probability distribution. The theorem states that this probability is exponentially small, with the rate of decay given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the two distributions.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, this principle is equivalent to Boltzmann's foundational insight, `S = k log W`, where `S` is the entropy, `k` is Boltzmann's constant, and `W` is the number of microscopic states corresponding to a given macroscopic state. The equilibrium distribution of particles is the one that maximizes the number of microstates `W`, and therefore maximizes the entropy `S`. This maximization is subject to physical constraints, such as a fixed total energy.\n\nFor a gas of indistinguishable bosons, maximizing the entropy derived from Bose-Einstein counting, subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy and a chemical potential of zero, yields the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average occupation number `<n_i>` of an energy state `ε_i`:\n\n<center>\n&lt;n_i&gt; = 1 / (exp(ε_i / kT) - 1)\n</center>\n\nThis distribution, when applied to photons, is also known as the Planck distribution, which forms the basis for deriving the thermodynamic properties of black-body radiation.\n\n### Role of the Cramer-Chernoff Theorem: Confirming the Mean Energy\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem deals with the probability that the empirical mean of a sequence of random variables deviates from its expected value. This theorem can be applied to the distribution of internal energy in a thermodynamic system. It formalizes the concept that for a large system, the probability of observing a mean energy that is different from the equilibrium mean energy is exponentially suppressed. The equilibrium state corresponds to the most probable mean energy, where the large deviation rate function is minimized.\n\nThus, the Cramer-Chernoff theorem complements the Boltzmann-Sanov approach by confirming that the system's energy distribution is sharply peaked around the mean value calculated from the Bose-Einstein distribution. Any significant fluctuation from this mean energy is a rare event.\n\n### Equilibrium Values for the Photon Gas\n\nOnce the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons is established as the equilibrium distribution, the macroscopic thermodynamic properties can be calculated by integrating over all possible photon energies (or frequencies).\n\n#### **Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe total internal energy (mean energy) `U` of the photon gas is found by integrating the energy of each mode multiplied by the average number of photons in that mode over the density of states for photons in a volume `V`. This calculation leads to the **Stefan-Boltzmann law**.\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy `U` is given by:\n\n<center>\n`U = (π²k_B⁴ / 15ħ³c³) * V * T⁴`\n</center>\n\nwhere:\n*   `V` is the volume.\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThis shows that the mean energy of a photon gas is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.\n\n#### **Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe entropy `S` of the photon gas is derived from the general statistical formula for the entropy of a Bose gas, using the equilibrium occupation numbers found from the Bose-Einstein distribution. The resulting equilibrium entropy is:\n\n<center>\n`S = (4π²k_B⁴ / 45ħ³c³) * V * T³`\n</center>\n\nThis demonstrates that the entropy of a photon gas at equilibrium is proportional to the volume and the third power of the temperature. The entropy per photon is constant, approximately 3.6 `k_B`."
