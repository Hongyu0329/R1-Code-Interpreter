    "<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators**: A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a $d$-dimensional quantum state (qudit) $\\rho$ is described by the operator-sum representation:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k P_k \\rho P_k^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{P_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators for a qudit, and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_k \\ge 0$, $\\sum_k p_k = 1$). The operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} P_k$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank**: For any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ has a rank that is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix $K$ constructed from these Kraus operators. The entries of the Gram matrix are given by the inner product of the Kraus operators:\n    $K_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(A_i^\\dagger A_j)$\n\n3.  **Constructing the Gram Matrix**: For the Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} P_k$. The entries of the Gram matrix are:\n    $K_{ij} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_i} P_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} P_j)) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(P_i^\\dagger P_j)$\n\n4.  **Orthogonality of Pauli Operators**: The generalized Pauli operators form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. Their orthogonality relation is:\n    $\\text{Tr}(P_i^\\dagger P_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$\n    where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 otherwise.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Rank of the Gram Matrix**: Substituting the orthogonality relation into the expression for the Gram matrix entries, we get:\n    $K_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} (d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}) = d \\cdot p_i \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$\n    This shows that the Gram matrix $K$ is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements are $K_{ii} = d \\cdot p_i$. The rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. The entry $K_{ii}$ is non-zero if and only if the probability $p_i$ is non-zero.\n\n6.  **Maximizing the Rank**: The rank of the complementary channel is therefore equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ in the definition of the Pauli channel. To maximize this rank, we need to choose a Pauli channel with the maximum possible number of non-zero $p_k$. The total number of generalized Pauli operators for a qudit is $d^2$. It is possible to define a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. A prime example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k=0, 1, ..., d^2-1$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of non-zero probabilities is $d^2$, which makes the rank of the Gram matrix, and consequently the rank of the complementary channel, equal to $d^2$.\n\n>>>$d^2$"
