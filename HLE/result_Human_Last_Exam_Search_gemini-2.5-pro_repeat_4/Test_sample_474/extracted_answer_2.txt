The approach is conceptually valid but methodologically flawed. While using untrained humans as a proxy for vertebrate predators is a justified and established technique in mimicry research, the use of unstandardized field images introduces confounding variables like lighting, background, and viewing angle that threaten the validity of the results. The method would be significantly improved by using standardized images and having participants group, rather than rank, the species.
