    "To determine the probability of finding the particle in a specific interval within a 1D box, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval.\n\nThe probability density function, P(x), for a particle in a 1D box is derived from the square of its wave function, ψ(x). For a given quantum state *n*, the normalized wave function is:\n\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nHere, 'a' is the length of the box. The probability density is therefore:\n\nP(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n\nFor this problem, we are interested in the state *n* = 2, and the interval is from 0.495a to 0.505a. The probability (Prob) is calculated by the following integral:\n\nProb = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. In this case, θ = 2πx/a.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nProb = (1/a) * ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ₐ [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\n\nEvaluating this integral gives:\n\nProb = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a\n\nAfter substituting the limits of the interval and simplifying, the expression for the probability is:\n\nProb = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\nCalculating the numerical value of this expression:\n\nProb ≈ 0.01 - (1 / (2 * 3.14159)) * sin(0.02 * 3.14159)\nProb ≈ 0.01 - 0.15915 * sin(0.06283)\nProb ≈ 0.01 - 0.15915 * 0.06279\nProb ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099934\nProb ≈ 0.00000656\n\nThis indicates a very low probability of finding the particle in this specific narrow interval around the center of the box for the n=2 state. This is expected, as the wave function for n=2 has a node (a point of zero probability) at the exact center of the box (x = 0.5a).\n\n<<<0.00000656>>>"
