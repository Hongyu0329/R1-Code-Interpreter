    "<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>\n\nThe scansion of the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is as follows:\n\nL S S S L S L L | L S S L S S\n\nBreaking this down into the eight feet of an iambic octonarius, allowing for common metrical substitutions:\n\n`et ti` | `bi be-n(e)` | `es-se` | `so-li` || `quom si-` | `bi sit` | `ma-le`\nL S | S S | L S | L L || L S | S L | S S\n\nThere seems to be a foot missing or the line is catalectic (incomplete), as this analysis yields seven feet. Roman comic meter is known for its complexity and irregularities. A highly plausible foot-by-foot scansion based on elision (`bene esse` -> `ben'esse`) and substitutions is:\n\nTrochee | Pyrrhic | Trochee | Spondee || Trochee | Iamb | Pyrrhic\n\nL S S S L S L L S S L S S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
