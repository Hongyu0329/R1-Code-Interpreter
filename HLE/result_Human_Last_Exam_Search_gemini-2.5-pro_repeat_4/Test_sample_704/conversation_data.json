    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself, is **G**.\n\nWhen yellow and blue pigments are mixed, the resulting color is green. Isaac Newton, in his work \"Opticks\" from 1704, created a color wheel where he associated the colors of the spectrum with the notes of a musical scale. Specifically, he used the Dorian musical mode, starting with the note D for the color red.\n\nIn this system, the seven colors of the spectrum are assigned to the notes as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   **Green - G**\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe range in question starts with green (the combination of yellow and blue) and ends at blue. The musical note assigned to the color green within Newton's color circle is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
