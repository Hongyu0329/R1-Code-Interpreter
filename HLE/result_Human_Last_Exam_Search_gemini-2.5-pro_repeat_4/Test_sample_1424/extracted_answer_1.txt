In the frequency-momentum domain, the bare Green's function G_0 is inversely proportional to (ω - ϵ_k), where ω is the frequency (or iω_n in the Matsubara formalism) and ϵ_k is the single-particle energy eigenvalue. The precise form includes a small imaginary part (e.g., +iε or -iε) in the denominator for real-time Green's functions to ensure causality. Specifically, G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k ± iε) for real-time Green's functions and G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - ϵ_k) for the imaginary-time (Matsubara) Green's function.
