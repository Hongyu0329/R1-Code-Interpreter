    "### In the Feynman Path Integral Formalism, the Bare Green's Function Exhibits a Direct Inverse Dependence on Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues\n\nIn the framework of the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ, is fundamentally an inverse relationship, manifesting as a pole at the energy of the particle. This relationship becomes explicit when the Green's function is expressed in the energy-momentum representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function is formally the inverse of the operator defining the dynamics of the free particle. For a non-interacting Hamiltonian, H₀, the Green's function operator can be written as:\n\n**G₀(E) = (E - H₀)⁻¹**\n\nWhen this operator is expressed in the basis of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, |k⟩, which satisfy H₀|k⟩ = ϵₖ|k⟩, the operator E - H₀ becomes a diagonal matrix with elements E - ϵₖ. Consequently, its inverse, the bare Green's function, is also diagonal with elements:\n\n**G₀(k, E) = 1 / (E - ϵₖ)**\n\nIn practical applications, this expression is handled in different ways depending on the specific physical context, particularly whether the formalism is in real or imaginary time.\n\n#### Real-Time Formalism\n\nIn the real-time formalism, which is used to describe scattering processes and response functions, the pole at E = ϵₖ is shifted by an infinitesimal imaginary term, iε, to ensure causality. This leads to different types of Green's functions:\n\n*   **Retarded Green's function (G₀ᴿ):** Describes the propagation of a particle forward in time.\n    **G₀ᴿ(k, E) = 1 / (E - ϵₖ + iε)**\n*   **Advanced Green's function (G₀ᴬ):** Describes propagation backward in time.\n    **G₀ᴬ(k, E) = 1 / (E - ϵₖ - iε)**\n*   **Feynman (or causal) Green's function (G₀ᶠ):** Used in quantum field theory to calculate scattering amplitudes.\n    **G₀ᶠ(k, E) = 1 / (E - ϵₖ + iε' * sgn(ϵₖ - µ))**, where µ is the chemical potential and sgn is the sign function.\n\nThese different forms are all derived from the path integral formulation by imposing specific boundary conditions on the path integration.\n\n#### Imaginary-Time (Matsubara) Formalism\n\nIn condensed matter physics, particularly at finite temperatures, the imaginary-time or Matsubara formalism is often employed. In this approach, real time is replaced by an imaginary time variable, τ, and the energy E is replaced by a discrete set of Matsubara frequencies, iωₙ. The bare Green's function for a system of non-interacting fermions is then given by:\n\n**G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - (ϵₖ - µ))**\n\nHere, ωₙ = (2n + 1)πT for fermions (where T is the temperature and n is an integer), and µ is the chemical potential. For bosons, the Matsubara frequencies are ωₙ = 2nπT.\n\nThe path integral provides a powerful method for deriving this result. The generating functional for a non-interacting theory is a Gaussian integral over the fields. The two-point Green's function is then found by taking the second functional derivative of the logarithm of this generating functional. This procedure naturally yields the inverse of the operator appearing in the quadratic part of the action, which in the frequency-momentum domain is precisely the denominator shown above.\n\nIn summary, across different formalisms within the path integral framework, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ is consistently that of a simple pole, with the specific form determined by the conventions of real or imaginary time.\n\n<<<In the frequency-momentum domain, the bare Green's function G_0 is inversely proportional to (ω - ϵ_k), where ω is the frequency (or iω_n in the Matsubara formalism) and ϵ_k is the single-particle energy eigenvalue. The precise form includes a small imaginary part (e.g., +iε or -iε) in the denominator for real-time Green's functions to ensure causality. Specifically, G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k ± iε) for real-time Green's functions and G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - ϵ_k) for the imaginary-time (Matsubara) Green's function.>>>"
