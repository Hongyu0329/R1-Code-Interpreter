    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect.\n\n**1. Define the Supply and Demand Functions:**\n\n*   **Supply:** `P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)`\n    *   This function is defined for `Q_S³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q_S > ³√2 ≈ 1.2599`.\n*   **Demand:** `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\n**2. Find Market Equilibrium:**\n\nEquilibrium occurs when `Q_S = Q_D = Q_E` and the price is equal. We set the two functions equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity `(Q_E)`:\n\n`ln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))`\n\nThis equation cannot be solved algebraically. Using numerical methods to solve for `Q_E`, we find:\n\n`Q_E ≈ 4.6784`\n\nWe can then find the equilibrium price `(P_E)` by substituting `Q_E` into either function:\n\n`P_E ≈ ln((4.6784)³ - 2) ≈ 4.609`\n`P_E ≈ 18e^(-arctan(4.6784)) ≈ 4.615`\n\nThe small difference is due to numerical rounding. We can proceed with the value of `Q_E`.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Welfare:**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). It can be calculated as the total area between the demand and supply curves from the minimum required quantity to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price `P_E`.\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price `P_E`.\n\nTotal Welfare (TW) = CS + PS, which can be calculated with the following integral:\n\n`TW = ∫[from 0 to Q_E] (Demand P(Q)) dQ - ∫[from ³√2 to Q_E] (Supply P(Q)) dQ`\n\nPlugging in the functions and the values:\n\n`TW = ∫[from 0 to 4.6784] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[from 1.2599 to 4.6784] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integrals:**\n\nWe evaluate these definite integrals numerically:\n\n*   The integral of the demand function from 0 to 4.6784 is approximately **30.334**. This represents the total benefit to consumers.\n*   The integral of the supply function from its starting point (`³√2`) to 4.6784 is approximately **10.862**. This represents the total cost to producers.\n\nSubtracting the total cost from the total benefit gives the total welfare:\n\n`TW ≈ 30.334 - 10.862 = 19.472`\n\n<<<19.472>>>"
