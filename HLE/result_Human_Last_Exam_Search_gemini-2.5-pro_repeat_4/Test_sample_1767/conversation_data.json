    "When two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the junction itself is not a well-defined concept in the same way as the bulk Chern number. Instead, the relevant physical property of the junction is the number of topologically protected conducting channels, or chiral edge states, that form at the interface.\n\nThis is determined by the bulk-boundary correspondence, which states that the number of chiral edge states at the interface between two regions with different topological invariants is given by the difference in their Chern numbers. For a junction between two materials with Chern numbers C₁ and C₂, the number of gapless modes along the interface is given by C₁ - C₂.\n\nIn the scenario presented, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, the difference is:\n\n1 - 1 = 0\n\nThis result indicates that there are no topologically protected chiral edge states at the junction. While the outer edges of the entire system will each host a single chiral edge state (as their individual Chern number is 1), the interface where the two C=1 insulators meet will be insulating.\n\nExperiments and theoretical models confirm this principle. For instance, a junction between a Chern insulator with C=1 and another with C=2 results in a single conducting channel at the interface (2 - 1 = 1). Similarly, a junction between regions with C=1 and C=-1 yields two conducting channels (1 - (-1) = 2).\n\n<<<0>>>"
