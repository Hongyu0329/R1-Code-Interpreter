    "While there is no direct quote in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* where a character explicitly states they are \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth,\" the character of Kris Kelvin is most closely associated with this sentiment through thematic and visual cues.\n\nThe film's opening sequences extensively feature Kris Kelvin immersed in the natural world of his father's dacha before his journey to the space station. These scenes linger on the sights and sounds of nature, including a breeze rustling through a meadow. This establishes a strong connection between Kris and the terrestrial environment he is leaving behind.\n\nThroughout the film, Kris undergoes significant psychological turmoil, grappling with his past, his conscience, and his sense of humanity. A pivotal line of dialogue spoken by Kris is, \"Shame, the feeling that will save mankind\". This directly links him to the theme of shame.\n\nGiven his established connection to the natural beauty of Earth and his expressed belief in the redemptive power of shame, it is a strong thematic interpretation that Kris would be the character to feel a sense of shame for missing something as fundamental to his terrestrial existence as the sound of rustling leaves.\n\n<<<A>>>"
