    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as S(q, ω), in the nuclear criticality community. This function is also sometimes referred to as the **scattering law** or thermal scattering law (TSL).\n\nThe dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity in nuclear criticality safety analysis as it describes the energy and momentum transfer during inelastic neutron scattering events. For thermal neutrons, the scattering cross-sections are sensitive to the structure and dynamics of the scattering material, which are captured by the dynamic structure factor. This is particularly important for moderating materials, such as water, where the thermal scattering data significantly impact the calculation of the effective neutron multiplication factor, k-eff.\n\nIn practice, the dynamic structure factor is often expressed in terms of dimensionless momentum and energy transfer variables, α and β, as S(α, β). This formulation is used in nuclear data libraries to provide the necessary information for criticality safety codes, like MCNP, to accurately model neutron transport and interactions.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
