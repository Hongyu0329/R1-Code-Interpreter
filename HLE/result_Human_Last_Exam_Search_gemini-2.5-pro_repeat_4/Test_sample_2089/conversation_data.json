    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate with a sacrificial act to save passengers on a vehicle is the 2003 Czech short film, *Most* (released in some countries as *The Bridge*).\n\nWhile the film features a train instead of a bus, the core elements of your query align closely with its plot. In the movie, a father who operates a railroad drawbridge is forced to make an impossible choice. His young son falls into the bridge's gearworks just as a train full of unsuspecting passengers approaches. To prevent a catastrophic train wreck, the father makes the heart-wrenching decision to lower the bridge, sacrificing his son to save the lives of those on board.\n\nIt is possible that the detail of the character saying \"Thank you\" and the vehicle being a bus are misremembered, as the central theme of a character's tragic self-sacrifice to save others is the defining moment of *Most*. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 2004.\n\nAnother Oscar-nominated short film with a similar theme is *Watu Wote: All of Us* (2017). In this film, based on a true story, a Muslim teacher named Salah Farah is shot and ultimately dies after defending Christian passengers during a terrorist attack on a bus in Kenya. However, the specific line \"Thank you\" is not reported as his final words.\n\nGiven the dramatic and memorable nature of the father's choice in *Most*, it is the most likely film you are recalling.\n\n<<<Most>>>"
