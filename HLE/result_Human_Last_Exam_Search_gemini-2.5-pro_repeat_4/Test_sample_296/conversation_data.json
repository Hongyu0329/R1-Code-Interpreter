    "The Grigorchuk group, denoted by G, has a number of distinctive properties that allow for the determination of its number of subgroups of a given index. A key property for this question is the structure of its abelianization, G/[G,G], which is the largest abelian quotient of the group.\n\nThe abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is the elementary abelian group of order 8, which is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, often written as (Z/2Z)^3. This fact is crucial because any homomorphism from G to an abelian group must factor through its abelianization.\n\nA subgroup of index 4 in G gives rise to a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S4, the group of permutations of 4 elements. The image of this homomorphism must be a transitive subgroup of S4. The transitive subgroups of S4 are the cyclic group of order 4 (C4), the Klein four-group (V4), the dihedral group of order 8 (D4), the alternating group of order 12 (A4), and the symmetric group of order 24 (S4).\n\nSince the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group (meaning the order of every element is a power of 2), any of its homomorphic images must also be a 2-group. This eliminates A4 and S4 as possible images. The potential images are therefore C4, V4, and D4.\n\nSubgroups of index 4 can be either normal or non-normal.\n*   **Normal subgroups of index 4:** A normal subgroup of index 4 corresponds to a surjective homomorphism from G to a group of order 4. The groups of order 4 are the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n    *   As the abelianization of G is (Z/2Z)^3, it has no elements of order 4. Therefore, there can be no surjective homomorphism from G to C4. This means there are no normal subgroups of index 4 with a cyclic quotient.\n    *   The number of normal subgroups with a quotient isomorphic to V4 (which is (Z/2Z)^2) can be calculated. This is equivalent to counting the number of surjective homomorphisms from G to V4. The number of homomorphisms from G to V4 is the same as the number of homomorphisms from its abelianization, (Z/2Z)^3, to V4. A homomorphism from (Z/2Z)^3 to (Z/2Z)^2 is determined by where it sends the three generators of the domain. Each of the 3 generators can be mapped to any of the 4 elements in the codomain, leading to 4^3 = 64 total homomorphisms. To find the number of surjective (onto) homomorphisms, we subtract the non-surjective ones. The image can be the trivial group (1 homomorphism) or a subgroup of order 2 (V4 has 3 such subgroups). For each of the 3 subgroups of order 2, there are 2^3 - 1 = 7 non-trivial homomorphisms from (Z/2Z)^3. This gives 1 + 3*7 = 22 non-surjective homomorphisms. Thus, there are 64 - 22 = 42 surjective homomorphisms. The number of distinct normal subgroups is the number of these surjective homomorphisms divided by the size of the automorphism group of V4, which is |Aut(V4)| = |GL(2,2)| = 6.  So, the number of normal subgroups of index 4 is 42 / 6 = 7.\n\n*   **Non-normal subgroups of index 4:** These would correspond to transitive actions on 4 elements where the image of the homomorphism to S4 is the dihedral group D4. A significant result by E. Pervova states that all maximal subgroups of the Grigorchuk group have index 2. This is a very strong condition on the subgroup structure. While this does not immediately rule out the existence of non-normal subgroups of index 4, it makes the top of the subgroup lattice very structured. It can be shown that all subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group are normal.\n\nTherefore, the Grigorchuk group has exactly 7 subgroups of index 4, all of which are normal subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
