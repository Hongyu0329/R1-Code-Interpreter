    "Answering the question \"For what values of λ does the equation u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 have no solutions?\" requires analyzing the given integral equation.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y), can be simplified using the formula for a finite geometric series:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} yᵏ.\n\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel. The integral equation can be written as:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ yᵏ u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the moments cₖ as the constants cₖ = ∫₀¹ yᵏ u(y) dy for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\nThe equation for u(x) then becomes:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ x^{n-1-k}\n\nThis shows that the solution u(x) must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1. We can determine the constants cₖ by substituting the expression for u(x) back into their definition:\ncₘ = ∫₀¹ yᵐ (1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ y^{n-1-k}) dy\ncₘ = ∫₀¹ yᵐ dy + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ ∫₀¹ yᵐ⁺ⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ dy\ncₘ = 1/(m+1) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} cₖ / (m+n-k)\n\nThis can be arranged into a system of n linear equations for the unknowns c₀, c₁, ..., cₙ₋₁:\ncₘ - λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} [1 / (m+n-k)] cₖ = 1 / (m+1) for m = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as (I - λA)c = b, where:\n*   c is the column vector of the moments [c₀, ..., cₙ₋₁]ᵀ.\n*   b is the column vector [1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ.\n*   A is the n×n matrix with entries Aₘₖ = 1 / (m+n-k).\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of linear equations has no solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, i.e., det(I - λA) = 0, and the vector b is not in the column space of (I - λA).\n\nThe condition det(I - λA) = 0 implies that 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. Let μ = 1/λ be an eigenvalue of A.\nIt can be shown that for these values of λ, the system is inconsistent, meaning no solution exists.\n\nTherefore, the values of λ for which the integral equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix A, where Aₘₖ = 1 / (m+n-k) for m, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nLet's find these values for specific n:\n\n**Case n = 1:**\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy. Let C = ∫₀¹ u(y) dy. Then u(x) = 1 + λC.\nIntegrating from 0 to 1 gives C = ∫₀¹ (1 + λC) dy = 1 + λC, so C(1-λ) = 1.\nIf λ = 1, this leads to 0 = 1, a contradiction, meaning there is no solution.\nThe matrix A is a 1x1 matrix: A = [1/(0+1-0)] =. Its only eigenvalue is μ=1. Thus, λ = 1/μ = 1.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\nThe matrix A is a 2x2 matrix:\nA = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]\nThe eigenvalues μ are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - μI) = 0:\n(1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0\nμ² - μ + 1/4 - 1/3 = 0\n12μ² - 12μ - 1 = 0\nThe solutions for μ are μ = (12 ± √192) / 24 = (12 ± 8√3) / 24 = (3 ± 2√3) / 6.\nThe values of λ are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues:\nλ = 1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / (9 - 12) = -2(3 ∓ 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\n\n**General Case:**\nFor a general integer n, the equation has no solution for λ = 1/μ, where μ is any of the n eigenvalues of the matrix A with entries Aₘₖ = 1 / (m+n-k). These eigenvalues are known to be real and distinct.\n\n<<<For a given integer n, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix A whose elements are given by A_{mk} = 1/(m+n-k), for m, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nFor n=1, the value is λ = 1.\nFor n=2, the values are λ = -6 + 4√3 and λ = -6 - 4√3.>>>"
