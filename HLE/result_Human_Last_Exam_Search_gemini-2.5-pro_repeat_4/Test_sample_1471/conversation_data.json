    "To solve the equation VIII/CCC-MMMDCCCLXXXVIII, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern numbers.\n\n*   **VIII** is equivalent to 8. The Roman numeral V represents 5 and I represents 1. When a symbol of lesser value follows a symbol of greater value, their values are added. Therefore, VIII = 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n*   **CCC** is equivalent to 300. The Roman numeral C represents 100. When a symbol is repeated, the values are added. Thus, CCC = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\n*   **MMMDCCCLXXXVIII** is equivalent to 3888. This breaks down as follows: MMM = 3000, D = 500, CCC = 300, LXXX = 80, and VIII = 8. Adding these values together gives 3000 + 500 + 300 + 80 + 8 = 3888.\n\nNow, we can substitute these modern numbers back into the equation:\n\n8 / 300 - 3888\n\nNext, we perform the calculation:\n\n8 ÷ 300 ≈ 0.0267\n\nThen, we subtract 3888 from this result:\n\n0.0267 - 3888 = -3887.9733\n\n<<<−3887.9733>>>"
