    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to a minor chord on the fifth degree is **\"Michelle\"**.\n\nThe song is in the key of F major, making the tonic chord F major. The fifth degree of F is C, and a minor chord on this degree would be C minor. While the song doesn't strictly open with an F major to C minor progression, its introduction famously begins on an F minor chord before the verse starts with F major. This immediate shift between the minor and major tonic is a very distinct feature. The extensive use of chords borrowed from the parallel minor key throughout the song contributes to its unique sound and is likely what is being referenced by the \"minor fifth chord\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
