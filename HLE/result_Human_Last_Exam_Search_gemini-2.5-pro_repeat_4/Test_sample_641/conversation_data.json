    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is given by the formula:\n`N = (1/4) * q^4 * (q+1)^3 * (q^2-q+1) * (q^2+1)`\nwhere q = 997.\n\nThis formula is derived by considering the preimages of involutions in the special unitary group SU(4, 997). An involution in PSU(4,q) is an element `gZ` where `Z` is the center of SU(4,q) and `(gZ)^2` is the identity, which means `g^2` must be in `Z`.\n\nFor `SU(4, 997)`, the center `Z` has size `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, the center is `{I, -I}`. The preimages `g` of involutions in PSU(4, 997) are the elements in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`, and `g` is not in the center.\n\nThe elements `g` in SU(4, 997) satisfying these conditions fall into two conjugacy classes:\n1.  Elements `g` such that `g^2 = I` and `g` is not central. These are involutions in SU(4, 997) with a 2-dimensional eigenspace for the eigenvalue -1.\n2.  Elements `g` such that `g^2 = -I`. Since 997 is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4, the eigenvalues `i` and `-i` are in the base field GF(997). These elements correspond to a decomposition of the vector space into two 2-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces.\n\nThe number of elements in each of these two classes is calculated by dividing the order of SU(4, 997) by the order of the centralizer of a representative element of the class. Summing the sizes of these two classes gives the total number of preimages. Since each involution in PSU(4, 997) has `d=2` preimages in SU(4, 997), this sum is divided by 2 to obtain the final count.\n\nSubstituting q = 997 into the formula yields the number:\n`N = (1/4) * 997^4 * (998)^3 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 1)`\n`N = (1/4) * 997^4 * 998^3 * 993013 * 994010`\n\nCalculating this value gives the total number of involutions.\n\n<<<9590403733270385808541537243920>>>"
