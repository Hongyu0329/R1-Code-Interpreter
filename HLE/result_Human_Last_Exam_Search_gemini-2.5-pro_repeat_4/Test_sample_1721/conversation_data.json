    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c + o(1))N$ and where the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $1/3$.\n\nHere is a justification for this value:\n\n**Lower Bound: c ≥ 1/3**\n\nConsider the set $A$ defined by the congruence class $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. The size of this set is $|A| \\approx N/3$, so the density is $c = 1/3$.\n\nLet's examine the sum of any two elements from this set. If $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, then $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Their sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n\nHowever, the square of any integer $k$ can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3:\n*   If $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n*   If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n*   If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n\nSince any sum of two elements from $A$ is congruent to 2 modulo 3, and no square number is congruent to 2 modulo 3, the sumset $A+A$ cannot contain any square numbers. This construction shows that $c$ can be at least $1/3$.\n\n**Upper Bound: c ≤ 1/3**\n\nProving that no set with a density greater than $1/3$ can have this property is more complex and relies on results from additive number theory. The key idea, as shown by I. Z. Ruzsa, is that if a set has a density exceeding $1/3$, it is \"too dense\" to avoid forming a square in its sumset.\n\nA simplified line of reasoning is as follows:\nLet $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ be a set such that $A+A$ contains no squares. Let's partition $A$ based on its residues modulo 3:\n*   $A_0 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n*   $A_1 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n*   $A_2 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\n\nThe sums of elements from these partitions produce the following residues modulo 3:\n*   $A_1 + A_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ (safe, as no square is $2 \\pmod 3$)\n*   $A_0 + A_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ (safe)\n*   $A_0 + A_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$ (potentially a square)\n*   $A_2 + A_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ (potentially a square)\n*   $A_0 + A_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ (potentially a square)\n*   $A_1 + A_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$ (potentially a square)\n\nIf the density of $A$ is greater than $1/3$, then by the pigeonhole principle, it's not possible for the set to be entirely contained within a single \"safe\" residue class like $A_1$. The set must contain a significant number of elements from the \"dangerous\" residue classes ($A_0$ or $A_2$). Advanced results in number theory show that if the densities of $A_0$ or $A_2$ are positive, the resulting sumsets ($A_0+A_0$, $A_2+A_2$, etc.) are large enough that they are guaranteed to contain a square number for a sufficiently large $N$.\n\nThe formal proof of this upper bound is non-trivial, but it confirms that the simple construction using numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3 is indeed optimal.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
