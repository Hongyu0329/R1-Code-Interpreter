    "The linear algebraic rank of a flag, when viewed as a matrix, is determined by the number of linearly independent rows or columns in its design. For the rank to be maximal, the numerical values assigned to different colors are chosen such that they do not create accidental linear dependencies. The flag of Denmark, featuring a white Nordic cross on a red field, has a rank of 2. This is because all rows in the flag's matrix can be constructed as a linear combination of just two distinct row vectors: a row for the horizontal part of the white cross, and a row for the red field which is interrupted by the vertical part of the white cross.\n\nTo find African flags with the same rank of 2, we must identify flags whose designs are also based on two linearly independent vectors. This typically includes flags with simple geometric patterns like two stripes or three stripes in an A-B-A pattern, without any additional complex emblems which would increase the number of unique row or column vectors.\n\nAfter analyzing the flags of all 54 sovereign nations in Africa, the following countries have flags with a linear algebraic rank of 2:\n\n*   **Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag is a vertical tricolor with a green, white, and green pattern. The columns of this flag's matrix are of only two types: an all-green column and an all-white column. As these two column vectors are linearly independent, the rank of the flag is 2.\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin features a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly. The rows of this flag's matrix are of two types: a row that is green and yellow, and a row that is green and red. These two types of rows are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a similar structure to Benin's flag. It consists of a vertical white band at the hoist with horizontal red and green bands. Consequently, its matrix is composed of two types of linearly independent rows—one white and red, the other white and green—giving it a rank of 2.\n\nOther flags that might seem to be candidates, such as those with two simple stripes but which also include emblems (like Angola or Burkina Faso), or those with an A-B-A stripe pattern but with a central emblem (like Mauritania), have a rank greater than 2 because the emblems introduce additional, complex patterns that increase the number of linearly independent vectors required to describe the entire flag.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
