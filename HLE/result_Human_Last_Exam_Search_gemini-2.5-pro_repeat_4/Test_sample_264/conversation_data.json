    "To find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes, we first define their positions in a 3D coordinate system.\n\nLet the first cube (C1) be represented by the region where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. Its side length is 1.\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The direction of this diagonal is given by the vector (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe second cube (C2) is shifted by 1/2 along this main diagonal. This is interpreted as a shift of 1/2 in each of the x, y, and z directions. Therefore, the shift vector is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\nThe coordinates of the second cube (C2) are obtained by adding the shift vector to the coordinates of the first cube. Thus, C2 occupies the region where 0 + 1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 1 + 1/2, 0 + 1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 1 + 1/2, and 0 + 1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 1 + 1/2. This simplifies to the region 1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 3/2, and 1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 3/2.\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that belongs to both C1 and C2. To find this, we determine the overlapping interval for each coordinate:\n*   **x-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **y-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **z-axis:** The intersection of and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe intersection forms a smaller cube with each side having a length of 1/2. The volume of this intersection is the product of the lengths of these intervals.\n\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
