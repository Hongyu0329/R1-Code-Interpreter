    "The order type of the set of finite strings of characters $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ ordered lexically is a specific, recursively defined countable order type. Let's denote the set of strings as $S$ and its order type as $T$. We assume the standard alphabetical order $a < b < c < d$.\n\nThe lexicographical order is defined as follows: for two strings $s_1$ and $s_2$, $s_1 < s_2$ if either:\n1.  $s_1$ is a proper prefix of $s_2$ (e.g., `a` < `aa`).\n2.  The strings have a common prefix `p`, such that $s_1 = p c_1 s'_1$ and $s_2 = p c_2 s'_2$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are single characters with $c_1 < c_2$ (e.g., `ab` < `ac`).\n\nThe key properties of this ordered set are:\n\n*   **It is a countable linear ordering.** The set of all finite strings over a finite alphabet is countably infinite, and the lexicographical order provides a total ordering of its elements.\n*   **It has a least element but no greatest element.** If the empty string is included, it is the least element. If not, \"a\" is the least element. There is no greatest element because for any string `s`, a longer string such as `sd` is always greater.\n*   **It is not a well-ordering.** An order is well-ordered if every non-empty subset has a least element, which is equivalent to having no infinite descending chains. The sequence `b` > `ab` > `aab` > `aaab` > ... is an infinite descending chain, proving the set is not well-ordered. Therefore, its order type is not an ordinal number.\n*   **It is not dense.** A linear order is dense if between any two distinct elements, there is another. In this set, for any string `s`, there is no string between `s` and `sa` (where `a` is the smallest character in the alphabet). Any string lexicographically greater than `s` must either be of the form `st`... where `t > s` (which would make it greater than `sa`) or of the form `s` followed by some characters. The lexicographically smallest string that has `s` as a prefix is `sa`.\n\nThe most precise characterization of this order type comes from its self-similar structure. The set of all strings $S$ can be partitioned into:\n1.  The empty string, {ε}.\n2.  The set of strings starting with 'a'.\n3.  The set of strings starting with 'b'.\n4.  The set of strings starting with 'c'.\n5.  The set of strings starting with 'd'.\n\nEach of the four latter sets is order-isomorphic to the original set $S$. For instance, the function f(s) = \"as\" is an order-isomorphism from the set of all strings to the set of strings that start with 'a'.\n\nThis structural property can be expressed as an equation for the order type $T$:\n$T = 1 + T + T + T + T = 1 + 4 \\cdot T$\n\nHere, `1` represents the order type of a single element (the empty string), `+` denotes the sum of order types (placing them one after another), and `4 \\cdot T` denotes the sum of four copies of the order type $T$.\n\nWhile there is no simpler standard name (like ω for the natural numbers or η for the rational numbers) for this order type, the equation $T = 1 + 4T$ serves as its defining characteristic.\n\n<<<The order type $T$ is the unique type of a countable linear ordering that satisfies the relation $T = 1 + 4 \\cdot T$, where 1 is the order type of a single point, `+` is the sum of order types, and `·` is the product of order types. This describes a countable, non-dense, non-well-ordered set with a first element but no last element.>>>"
