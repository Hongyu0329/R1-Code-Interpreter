The order type $T$ is the unique type of a countable linear ordering that satisfies the relation $T = 1 + 4 \cdot T$, where 1 is the order type of a single point, `+` is the sum of order types, and `Â·` is the product of order types. This describes a countable, non-dense, non-well-ordered set with a first element but no last element.
