    "There are **11** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA set *S* within a group *G* is defined as product-free if the product of any two elements in *S* (including an element with itself) is not an element of *S*. A product-free set is considered maximal by inclusion, or locally maximal, if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by M. Giudici and S. Hart. According to their findings, the finite groups that have a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n\n*   **C₄**: The cyclic group of order 4.\n*   **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n*   **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n*   **D₆**: The dihedral group of order 12.\n*   **C₇**: The cyclic group of order 7.\n*   **C₈**: The cyclic group of order 8.\n*   **C₂ × C₂**: The Klein four-group.\n*   **C₄ × C₂**: The direct product of the cyclic groups of order 4 and 2.\n*   **C₂ × Q₈**: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the quaternion group of order 8.\n*   **Q₁₂**: The dicyclic group of order 12.\n*   The group with the presentation **⟨g, h | g⁴ = 1, h⁴ = 1, hg = g⁻¹h⟩**.\n\nThese 11 groups constitute the complete list of finite groups with the specified property.\n\n<<<11>>>"
