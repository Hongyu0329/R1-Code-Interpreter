    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different long-term behavior. Such curves are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points exist where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are zero.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**2. Classifying the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe analyze the stability of each point by linearizing the system and examining the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** The Jacobian is $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):** The Jacobian is $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the equilibrium is non-hyperbolic and requires further analysis.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1). Let's find the equation for the unstable manifold, which often forms a key separatrix.\n\nWe can test for a simple invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$. Let's test the function $d = -u^2$.\nThe derivative with respect to time is $d' = -2u \\cdot u' = -2u(u-1)u^2 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nNow we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original equation for $d'(t)$:\n$$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$$\n$$d'(t) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$$\nSince the expressions match, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nTo confirm it's the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1), we check two things:\n1.  The curve passes through the saddle point: For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The point (1, -1) is on the curve.\n2.  The tangent of the curve at the saddle point matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector.\n    The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$ of $J(1, -1)$ is found by solving $(J - I)v = 0$:\n    $$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u $$\n    The eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -2)$, indicating a slope of -2.\n    The slope of the curve $d = -u^2$ is given by $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is -2.\n\nThe slope matches the eigenvector direction. Therefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1). This manifold acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors. For instance, in the strip $0 < u < 1$, it separates trajectories that are attracted to the origin from those that escape to infinity.\n\nThe separatrix of the system is the curve defined by the equation:\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
