    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad***\n\nThe first step is to read through the *Iliad* and compile a list of all real-world mountains that are explicitly named or clearly referenced.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned extensively throughout the epic. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida (Trojan Ida):** A mountain range near Troy (in modern-day Turkey). It is a key location in the epic, most famously as the spot from where Zeus watches the Trojan War and where the Judgment of Paris took place. The *Iliad* refers to its peak, Gargarus.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Fengari/Saos):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on the highest peak of \"wooded Samothrace\" to observe the battle. From there, he can see Mount Ida, Troy, and the Greek ships.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, the goddess Hera, traveling from Olympus to Lemnos, steps \"from Athos ... upon the heaving sea.\" This is a prominent mountain in northern Greece.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** In several passages (e.g., Book 16 and 19), Achilles' famous ash spear is said to have been cut from a tree on the peak of Mount Pelion and given to his father, Peleus, by the centaur Chiron.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** In Book 2, in the \"Catalogue of Ships,\" the Maeonian forces are said to come from a land \"under snow-capped Tmolus.\" This is a historical mountain in Lydia, a region in ancient western Anatolia (modern Turkey).\n\n### **Step 2: Note careful points and potential exclusions**\n\n*   **Focus on the *Iliad* only:** Myths or mountain references from other texts, like the *Odyssey* (e.g., the giants stacking Pelion on Ossa) or later Roman works, are not applicable.\n*   **Distinguish between Trojan Ida and Cretan Ida:** The myths of Zeus's infancy are set on Mount Ida on Crete. However, within the narrative of the *Iliad*, every reference to \"Ida\" as a geographical location of the story's action refers to the mountain range overlooking Troy. Cretan Ida is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\n*   **Distinguish between specific mountains and general regions:** In Book 14, Hera's journey takes her over \"Pieria and lovely Emathia\" and the \"snowy mountains of the Thracian horsemen.\" These are mountainous regions, not specifically named single mountains. Mount Tmolus, Mount Athos, etc., are mentioned by name, making them stronger candidates for \"mentioned mountain.\"\n\n### **Step 3: List the confirmed mountains and their modern elevations**\n\nWe now collect the elevations for the historical mountains identified in Step 1.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 feet) - This is our baseline, the tallest.\n*   **Mount Tmolus** (modern Bozdağ): 2,159 meters (7,083 feet)\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Trojan)** (modern Kaz Dağı): 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace** (modern Fengari): 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n### **Step 4: Rank the mountains and determine the answer**\n\nRanking the mountains by elevation from tallest to shortest:\n1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m)\n2.  **Mount Tmolus (2,159 m)**\n3.  Mount Athos (2,033 m)\n4.  Mount Ida (Trojan) (1,774 m)\n5.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n6.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\nAfter Mount Olympus, the next tallest historical mountain mentioned by name in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
