    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Jacek Dukaj follows the protagonist Adam Zamoyski. He is a 21st-century human who is cryogenically frozen and revived in the far future, in the 29th century.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the protagonist's relationships.**\nAdam Zamoyski's story is fundamentally intertwined with a powerful, almost god-like posthuman entity named Angelika. Their relationship is the central axis of the plot.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the term \"marries\" in the context of the novel's setting.**\nThe novel is set in a posthuman reality where concepts like \"marriage\" do not exist in their traditional 21st-century form. The societies are vastly different, and relationships are structured by power, technology, and levels of existence (known as \"subtleties\"). A literal marriage ceremony does not take place.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the nature of the bond between Adam and Angelika.**\nThe relationship between Adam and Angelika is not a partnership of equals, at least not initially. Angelika essentially \"owns\" or \"creates\" Adam in his new form. He is bound to her. However, their bond is the most profound and defining union in the novel. It functions as the narrative equivalent of a marriage—an exclusive, life-altering, and permanent connection that dictates the fate of the protagonist. While not a marriage in the traditional sense, Angelika is the character to whom Adam Zamoyski is uniquely and inextricably bound.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the answer.**\nBased on the narrative's focus and the unique nature of their bond, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a union with (the functional equivalent of marrying) is Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
