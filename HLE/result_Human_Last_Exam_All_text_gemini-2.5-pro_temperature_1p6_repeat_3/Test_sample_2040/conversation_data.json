    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one photon of higher energy (the pump photon, $\\omega_p$) spontaneously splits into a pair of photons with lower energies (the signal photon, $\\omega_s$, and the idler photon, $\\omega_i$) inside a nonlinear optical medium. This process must conserve both energy ($\\omega_p = \\omega_s + \\omega_i$) and momentum ($\\vec{k}_p = \\vec{k}_s + \\vec{k}_i$).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental material requirement for SPDC.**\nThe interaction responsible for SPDC is mathematically described by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$. For SPDC to occur, the material must have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ value.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the material requirement ($\\chi^{(2)} \\neq 0$) to material symmetry.**\nThere is a fundamental principle in nonlinear optics: only materials that lack a center of inversion (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric) can possess a non-zero bulk second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$). In a material with inversion symmetry (a centrosymmetric material), applying an electric field $\\vec{E}$ or its inverse $-\\vec{E}$ should produce polarizations that are perfect opposites. This mathematical constraint forces all even-order susceptibility tensors, including $\\chi^{(2)}$, to be zero.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the structure and symmetry of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene).**\nBoron nanosheets are 2D allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, borophene is highly polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different atomic arrangements. The most widely studied and experimentally synthesized phases (typically grown on substrates like silver) are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3}$ phases. When considered as ideal, free-standing 2D crystals, these common phases are known to be centrosymmetric.\n*   The **$\\beta_{12}$** sheet has a *pmmn* space group.\n*   The **$\\chi_3}$** sheet also has a *pmmn* space group.\n*   Other theoretical structures like the triangular $\\alpha$-sheet are also centrosymmetric.\nA key feature of these space groups is the presence of an inversion center.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the material property with the physical requirement to reach a conclusion.**\n1.  SPDC requires a non-centrosymmetric material ($\\chi^{(2)} \\neq 0$).\n2.  Ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets in their common, stable phases ($\\beta_{12}$, $\\chi_3}$) are centrosymmetric.\n3.  Due to their inversion symmetry, their intrinsic $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n4.  Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets are **not** expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n---\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Nanosheets:** The analysis above is for an ideal, perfect crystal lattice. Real-world nanosheets will have defects, edges, strain, wrinkles, or out-of-plane buckling. These imperfections locally break the inversion symmetry and could, in principle, lead to a very weak, localized $\\chi^{(2)}$ response. However, this would not be an intrinsic property of the material itself, and the resulting SPDC signal would be expected to be extremely weak compared to that from a truly non-centrosymmetric crystal.\n2.  **Free-standing vs. Substrate-Supported:** The question explicitly states \"free-standing\". If the borophene were on a substrate, the interaction at the borophene-substrate interface would break the inversion symmetry, potentially allowing for SPDC to occur at this interface. This is not relevant for the free-standing case.\n3.  **Higher-Order Effects:** In centrosymmetric materials, extremely weak second-order effects can sometimes arise from electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole interactions, or from symmetry-breaking at the surface. For a 2D material, the entire sheet is a \"surface,\" but the dominant factor is the intrinsic in-plane crystal symmetry. These higher-order contributions are typically orders of magnitude weaker than the standard electric dipole ($\\chi^{(2)}$) response in non-centrosymmetric materials.\n4.  **Polymorphism:** While the common phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible for an exotic, non-centrosymmetric phase of borophene to exist. However, based on current scientific understanding of stable borophene structures, the primary expectation is based on the common, centrosymmetric forms.\n\nBased on the fundamental symmetry properties of the material, the primary and expected answer is definitive.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNo, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$). A material can only possess a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ if its crystal structure lacks a center of inversion (i.e., is non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (such as $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3}$) are known to have centrosymmetric crystal structures. Due to this inversion symmetry, their intrinsic $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, which forbids the SPDC process from occurring.\n\n<<<No>>>"
