    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Request**\nThe user wants to find the continued fraction associated with the \"generalized Markov number\" $m_{4/7}$. This implies there's a specific construction that takes a rational number $p/q$ and produces a continued fraction. This continued fraction is of a quadratic irrationality whose properties (like its Markov constant) are related to the Markov spectrum.\n\n**2. Identify the Key Concepts**\n*   **Generalized Markov Numbers:** The notation $m_{p/q}$ suggests a generalization of the classical Markov numbers (1, 2, 5, 13, ...). The classical Markov numbers are related to specific quadratic irrationals, and these, in turn, are specified by rational numbers (e.g., the solution $(1,2,5)$ with $m=5$ can be associated with the rational $1/2$ or $2/5$ depending on the framework).\n*   **Continued Fractions and the Markov Spectrum:** The values in the Markov spectrum are determined by the approximation properties of certain quadratic irrationals. These quadratic irrationals have periodic continued fraction expansions. The most prominent constructions often lead to continued fractions whose periodic part is a palindrome.\n*   **Farey Neighbors:** The construction methods often involve a rational number $p/q$ and its \"neighbors\" in the Farey sequence or the Stern-Brocot tree. For a rational $p/q$, its Farey neighbors $p'/q'$ are rationals that satisfy $qp' - pq' = \\pm 1$.\n\n**3. Find a Construction Method**\nThere are several methods in the literature to construct a quadratic irrational from a rational number. A prominent and geometrically motivated one involves composing the continued fraction expansions of two Farey neighbors. Let's adopt the following method, which is found in several modern sources (e.g., works by C. Series, J. Levesley et al.):\n\n*   Given a rational number $p/q \\in (0,1)$.\n*   Find its predecessor $p'/q'$ in the corresponding Farey sequence, which is a rational number satisfying $qp' - pq' = 1$.\n*   Find the continued fraction expansions for both rationals, $p/q = [0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]$ and $p'/q' = [0; b_1, \\dots, b_m]$.\n*   Adjust one of the expansions if necessary (using the identity $[..., k] = [..., k-1, 1]$) so that one has even length and the other has odd length. Let the corresponding integer sequences be $w_1 = (a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ and $w_2 = (b_1, \\dots, b_m)$.\n*   The periodic part of the associated continued fraction is formed by concatenating the first word with the reverse of the second: $W = w_1 w_2^R$. The resulting word is always a palindrome.\n*   The associated continued fraction is then given by $[0; \\overline{W}]$.\n\n**4. Apply the Method to $p/q = 4/7$**\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Find the Farey predecessor.**\n    We need to find integers $p', q'$ such that $7p' - 4q' = 1$ with $0 \\le p' < q'$. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm for 7 and 4:\n    $7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3$\n    $4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1$\n    $1 = 4 - 3 = 4 - (7 - 4) = 2 \\cdot 4 - 1 \\cdot 7$.\n    So, $4(2) - 7(1) = 1$. This has the form $-4q' + 7p' = 1$, which gives $p'=1, q'=2$. This yields $p'/q'=1/2$. The equation is satisfied, but this gives $qp'-pq' = 7(1)-4(2)=-1$. Let's try to find a solution for $4q'-7p'=1$. This implies $4q' \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$, multiplying by 2 gives $8q' \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$, so $q' \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$. Let $q'=2$, then $4(2)-7p'=1 \\implies 7p'=7 \\implies p'=1$. This is the same pair.\n    The other neighbour must satisfy $qp' - pq'=-1$, or $4q'-7p'=-1$. This is $7p'-4q'=1$. We found $p'=3, q'=5$, so $p'/q' = 3/5$.\n    The Farey sequence $F_7$ confirms that the neighbors of $4/7$ are $3/5$ and $1/2$. The predecessor (the one with the smaller value) is $3/5$ if we order them on the number line. However, the convention requires $qp'-pq'=1$, which corresponds to the pair $(4/7, 3/5)$, as $7(3)-4(5)=1$.\n\n*   **Step 4.2: Find the continued fractions.**\n    For $p/q = 4/7$:\n    $4/7 = 1 / (7/4) = 1 / (1 + 3/4) = 1 / (1 + 1/(4/3)) = 1 / (1 + 1/(1+1/3)) = [0; 1, 1, 3]$. The length is $n=3$ (odd).\n    For $p'/q' = 3/5$:\n    $3/5 = 1 / (5/3) = 1 / (1 + 2/3) = 1 / (1 + 1/(3/2)) = 1 / (1 + 1/(1+1/2)) = [0; 1, 1, 2]$. The length is $m=3$ (odd).\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Adjust lengths for parity.**\n    We need one sequence to have even length and the other odd. We can write $a_k$ as $(a_k-1), 1$.\n    Let's change the expansion for $4/7$:\n    $4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] = [0; 1, 1, 2, 1]$. The new length is $n=4$ (even).\n    We leave the expansion for $3/5$ as is:\n    $3/5 = [0; 1, 1, 2]$. The length is $m=3$ (odd).\n    So, we have the integer words:\n    $w_1 = (1, 1, 2, 1)$ for $4/7$.\n    $w_2 = (1, 1, 2)$ for $3/5$.\n\n*   **Step 4.4: Construct the periodic part.**\n    We need the reverse of $w_2$, which is $w_2^R = (2, 1, 1)$.\n    The final periodic word is $W = w_1 w_2^R = (1, 1, 2, 1) \\cdot (2, 1, 1) = (1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1)$.\n    As a check, this sequence is a palindrome, as expected from the construction.\n\n*   **Step 4.5: Write down the final continued fraction.**\n    The associated continued fraction is $[0; \\overline{W}]$.\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction is $[0; \\overline{1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1}]$.\n\nFinal check: Using the other neighbor $1/2$. $p/q=4/7 = [0;1,1,3]$ (odd). $p'/q'=1/2 = [0;1,1]$ (even). $w_1=(1,1,3), w_2=(1,1)$. $w_2^R=(1,1)$. $W=w_1 w_2^R = (1,1,3,1,1)$. This is another valid construction associated with a different value in the spectrum. The choice of neighbor matters. Typically, the neighbor that forms the mediant pair $(p'/q', (p-p')/(q-q'))$ is used. $4/7$ is the mediant of $1/2$ and $3/5$. The construction for this situation involves concatenating words associated with the parents. A simpler and more common approach is to pick the Farey predecessor, which is $3/5$.\n\nFinal calculation is based on the pair $(4/7, 3/5)$.\n\nThe continued fraction is $[0; 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, \\dots]$."
