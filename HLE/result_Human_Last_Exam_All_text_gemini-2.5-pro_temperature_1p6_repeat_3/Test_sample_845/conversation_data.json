    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Capturing \"beat-to-beat intervals\" using Photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG measures the pulse wave.\n    *   **Key Phrase:** \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats.\"\n    *   **The Question:** \"What is that value called?\"\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **Distinguish between the raw measurement and the final calculation:** HRV is a statistical measure of *variability*. The question is not asking for the name of the HRV metric (like RMSSD or SDNN), but for the name of the fundamental unit of measurement *used to compute* HRV.\n    *   **Consider the signal source:** The source is PPG. In medicine, different signal sources can have slightly different terminology. For an Electrocardiogram (ECG), the interval between the prominent 'R' peaks of the heart's electrical signal is called the \"R-R interval\". For a PPG, which measures blood volume pulse, the interval is between consecutive pulse peaks.\n    *   **Find the common term:** There is a general, widely accepted term that describes the time duration between any two consecutive heartbeats, regardless of whether it's measured via ECG or PPG.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Path to the Answer:**\n    1.  The question describes measuring the time that elapses from one heartbeat to the next. This is the \"beat-to-beat interval\".\n    2.  This interval is the raw data point. For example, one interval might be 800 milliseconds, the next 820 ms, the next 790 ms.\n    3.  Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is calculated by analyzing the variation in a sequence of these interval measurements.\n    4.  The most common and technically correct term for this beat-to-beat interval duration is the **Inter-beat Interval**, which is often abbreviated as **IBI**. While \"R-R Interval\" is also very common, it is technically specific to ECG signals. \"Inter-beat Interval\" is a more general term that perfectly fits the description of a beat-to-beat interval measured by PPG.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe value is the time duration between consecutive heartbeats. This raw data is used to calculate HRV metrics.\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval>>>"
