    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify key paintings by Lady Butler and the historical events they depict.**\nLady Elizabeth Butler was a renowned British military painter. To answer the question, we must first list some of her famous paintings that depict battles or specific military campaigns and identify the historical event associated with each.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted in 1875): This painting depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted in 1881): This work shows the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted in 1874): This painting shows soldiers from the Grenadier Guards after the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted in 1880): This work depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted in 1885): This painting portrays the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted c. 1893): This painting depicts a scene from the Gordon Relief Expedition, part of the Mahdist War, widely associated with the Battle of Abu Klea.\n*   ***A Souvenir of the Great War*** (painted c. 1919-20): This later work depicts weary French soldiers (\"poilus\") returning from the trenches during World War I.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the historical date of each battle or conflict.**\nNow, we need to find the dates when these historical events occurred to see which one is the latest.\n\n*   **Battle of Quatre Bras:** June 16, 1815\n*   **Battle of Waterloo:** June 18, 1815\n*   **Battle of Inkerman (Crimean War):** November 5, 1854\n*   **Battle of Rorke's Drift:** January 22–23, 1879\n*   **Battle of Tel El Kebir:** September 13, 1882\n*   **Battle of Abu Klea (Mahdist War):** January 17, 1885\n*   **World War I:** July 28, 1914 – November 11, 1918\n\n**Step 3: Compare the dates to identify the latest historical event.**\nBy comparing the dates of these events, we can create a chronological list:\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras (1815)\n2.  Battle of Waterloo (1815)\n3.  Battle of Inkerman (1854)\n4.  Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879)\n5.  Battle of Tel El Kebir (1882)\n6.  Battle of Abu Klea (1885)\n7.  World War I (1914-1918)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to distinguish between the date a painting was created and the date of the historical event it depicts. For example, *Scotland Forever!* was painted in 1881, but the Battle of Waterloo happened in 1815.\n*   The question asks for the latest \"battle.\" While *A Souvenir of the Great War* may not show combat in action, it portrays a scene directly from the conflict of World War I. This conflict, and the battlefront scenes within it, are the latest historical military subject matter Lady Butler painted. Compared to the other specific, named battles which all occurred in the 19th century, World War I (1914-1918) is significantly later.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the latest historical military conflict depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is World War I, as shown in her work *A Souvenir of the Great War*.\n\n<<<World War I>>>"
