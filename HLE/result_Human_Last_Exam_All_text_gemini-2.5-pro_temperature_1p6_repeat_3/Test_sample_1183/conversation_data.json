    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry group of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the SMILES String to Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **SMILES String:** `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`\n*   **Identify the Core:** The core of the molecule is represented by the complex fused ring system: `c1cc2ccc3cc4ccc5cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`. This SMILES string corresponds to a well-known Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) called **hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene** (HBC). Unsubstituted HBC is a highly symmetric, planar, disk-shaped molecule.\n*   **Identify the Substituents:** The string shows three `C#C` groups. In this context, `c(C#C)` means an ethynyl group (-C≡CH) is attached as a branch to a carbon atom of the aromatic core.\n*   **Identify the Substitution Pattern:**\n    1.  `C#Cc1...`: An ethynyl group is attached to atom `c1`.\n    2.  `...c3c(C#C)...`: An ethynyl group is attached to atom `c3`.\n    3.  `...c5c(C#C)...`: An ethynyl group is attached to atom `c5`.\n*   **Visualize the Structure:** The HBC core has D6h symmetry, resembling a six-pointed star or \"superbenzene\". The labels `c1`, `c3`, `c5` from the SMILES string correspond to attachment points on three alternating \"points\" of this star-like structure. The molecule is therefore **1,3,5-triethynyl-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Geometry of the Molecule**\n\n*   The hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene core is known to be a rigid, **planar** molecule.\n*   The ethynyl group (-C≡CH) is linear.\n*   The C(aromatic)-C(ethynyl) single bond allows for rotation, but the lowest energy conformation will have the ethynyl groups lying in the same plane as the HBC core to maximize electronic conjugation and minimize steric hindrance.\n*   Therefore, the entire molecule is planar.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Symmetry Elements of the Structure**\n\nWe will systematically identify the symmetry elements present in this planar, 1,3,5-substituted HBC molecule.\n\n*   **Principal Rotation Axis (Cn):**\n    *   The unsubstituted HBC core has a C6 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   The 1,3,5-substitution pattern breaks this six-fold symmetry. A rotation by 60° (C6) would move a substituted position to an unsubstituted one.\n    *   However, a rotation by 120° (2π/3 radians) perfectly maps each substituted position onto another substituted position, and each unsubstituted position onto another unsubstituted position.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a **C3 rotation axis** perpendicular to the plane, which is the principal axis.\n\n*   **Perpendicular C2 Axes:**\n    *   We look for C2 axes that are perpendicular to the main C3 axis (i.e., lying within the molecular plane).\n    *   An axis passing through the center of the molecule and through one of the ethynyl-substituted corners is a C2 axis. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the substituent on that axis unchanged (since it's linear) while swapping the other two substituted corners and the corresponding unsubstituted corners.\n    *   Since there are three such substituted corners, there are **three C2 axes** in the plane, separated by 120°.\n\n*   **Mirror Planes (σ):**\n    *   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σh):** Because the entire molecule is planar, the plane containing all the atoms is a mirror plane. This plane is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Thus, a **σh exists**.\n    *   **Vertical Mirror Planes (σv):** A vertical mirror plane must contain the principal C3 axis. The planes that contain the C3 axis and each of the three C2 axes act as mirror planes. Such a plane perfectly reflects one side of the molecule onto the other. For example, the plane passing through the substituent at position '1' reflects the substituent at '3' onto the one at '5'. Therefore, there are **three σv planes**.\n\n*   **Inversion Center (i):**\n    *   An inversion center would map every atom at coordinates (x, y, z) to (-x, -y, -z).\n    *   If we take an atom on one of the ethynyl groups and invert it through the center of the molecule, it does not map onto another atom. It maps to an empty point in space on the opposite side.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule **does not possess a center of inversion**.\n\n*   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sn):**\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane automatically implies the existence of an **S3 axis** coincident with the C3 axis.\n\n**Step 4: Assign the Point Group**\n\nLet's summarize the key symmetry elements we have found:\n*   A principal C3 axis.\n*   Three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. (This combination defines the **D3** family).\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\nA point group of the D_n_ family that also contains a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is, by definition, the **D_nh_** point group. Since n=3, the point group is **D3h**.\n\nThis assignment is consistent with all the elements we found: E, 2C3, 3C2, σh, 3σv, and 2S3.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
