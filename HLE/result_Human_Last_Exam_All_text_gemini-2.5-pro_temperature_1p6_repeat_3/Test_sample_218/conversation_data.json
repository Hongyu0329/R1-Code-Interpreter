    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the correspondence between irreps and partitions**\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$. For $S_{25}$, we are interested in the partitions of 25.\n\n**Step 2: The Hook-Length Formula for Dimension**\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is given by the hook-length formula. For each box $(i, j)$ (in row $i$ and column $j$) of the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, its hook length $h_\\lambda(i, j)$ is the number of boxes to its right in the same row, plus the number of boxes below it in the same column, plus 1 (for the box itself). The dimension $d_\\lambda$ is:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in \\lambda} h_\\lambda(i, j)}$\nwhere the product is over all boxes in the diagram.\n\nAn important property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda^t$ (obtained by flipping the Young diagram along its main diagonal) correspond to irreps of the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda^t}$. An irrep is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda^t$.\n\n**Step 3: Systematic Search for Partitions with Small Dimensions**\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is smallest for partitions that are \"long and thin,\" meaning they have a very large first part $\\lambda_1$ compared to the other parts. We will systematically search for such partitions of $n=25$. For each partition $\\lambda$ we find, we will also count its distinct conjugate $\\lambda^t$. A partition $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate if its first part $\\lambda_1$ is not equal to its number of parts $k$. All partitions we will find satisfy this condition.\n\nWe will list partitions $\\lambda$ of 25, ordered by the first part $\\lambda_1$, and calculate their dimension $d_\\lambda$.\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 25$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: This is the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n      ($1 < 500,000$)\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 24$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: $d_{(24,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{1} = 24$.\n      ($24 < 500,000$)\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 23$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1^2)$: $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n      (Both are $< 500,000$)\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 22$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4025$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1^3)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n      (All three are $< 500,000$)\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 21$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 4)$: $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 3, 1)$: $d_{(21,3,1)} = 8,360$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 2)$: $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 1, 1)$: $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 31,625$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 1^4)$: $d_{(21,1^4)} = \\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$.\n      (All five are $< 500,000$)\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 20$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 5)$: $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 4, 1)$: $d_{(20,4,1)} = 164,100$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 2)$: $d_{(20,3,2)} = 207,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 1, 1)$: $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 158,400$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 2, 1)$: $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 209,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 1^3)$: $d_{(20,2,1^3)} = 168,025$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 1^5)$: $d_{(20,1^5)} = \\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$.\n      (All seven are $< 500,000$)\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 19$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$: $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 5, 1)$: $d_{(19,5,1)} = 316,250$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 4, 2)$: $d > 1,000,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 3, 3)$: $d_{(19,3,3)} = 258,060$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 2, 1^4)$: $d_{(19,2,1^4)} = 413,375$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 1^6)$: $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$.\n      (Five partitions found)\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 18$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$: $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 6, 1)$: $d > 700,000$. Other partitions like $(18,5,2)$, etc., will have even larger dimensions.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 1^7)$: $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$.\n      (Two partitions found)\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$:**\n    *   For $\\lambda=(17,8)$, $d>600,000$.\n    *   For $\\lambda=(17,1^8)$, $d>700,000$.\n    *   Any other partition starting with 17 or less will have an even larger dimension, as their shape becomes \"less hook-like\" and more \"centered\", which increases the dimension. Therefore, no partitions with $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$ will have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 4: Count the found partitions**\nLet's tally the number of unique partitions we found whose irrep dimension is less than 500,000.\n*   $\\lambda_1=25$: 1 partition\n*   $\\lambda_1=24$: 1 partition\n*   $\\lambda_1=23$: 2 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=22$: 3 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=21$: 5 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=20$: 7 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=19$: 5 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=18$: 2 partitions\nTotal number of such partitions: $1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 26$.\n\n**Step 5: Account for Conjugate Partitions**\nFor each partition $\\lambda$ found, its conjugate $\\lambda^t$ has the same dimension, $d_{\\lambda^t} = d_{\\lambda}$. If $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda^t$, then this pair corresponds to two distinct irreps. A partition is self-conjugate ($\\lambda = \\lambda^t$) if its Young diagram is symmetric. This can only happen if its first part equals its number of parts ($\\lambda_1=k$).\nAll 26 partitions we found are very \"long,\" e.g., for $\\lambda = (25)$, $\\lambda_1=25, k=1$. For $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$, $\\lambda_1=18, k=8$. In all 26 cases, $\\lambda_1 \\neq k$, so none of them are self-conjugate.\nThus, each of the 26 partitions corresponds to a pair of distinct irreps $(\\lambda, \\lambda^t)$, each having the same dimension less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nThe total number of irreps is twice the number of partitions found.\nTotal irreps = $26 \\times 2 = 52$."
