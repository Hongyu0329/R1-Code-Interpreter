    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Logical Qubits in Surface Codes\n\nA logical qubit is encoded in the collective state of many physical qubits. Its logical state is protected from local errors by stabilizer measurements. The number of logical qubits a surface code can encode depends on its topology (its shape, number of boundaries, and holes).\n\n*   **A Single Standard Patch:** A simple, rectangular patch of surface code with no holes can encode exactly **one logical qubit**. The logical operators are strings of Pauli operators that connect opposite boundaries of the patch.\n*   **Holes as Resources:** Holes can be created in the surface code patch by intentionally not performing stabilizer measurements in a designated region. These holes act as internal boundaries and provide a way to define additional logical qubits.\n*   **Counting Qubits from Holes:** For a single patch of surface code (which is topologically a disk, with one external boundary), adding $N_h$ holes creates $N_h$ new internal boundaries. The total number of boundaries becomes $1 + N_h$. By defining logical operators as strings that connect pairs of these boundaries, it's possible to encode a number of logical qubits equal to the number of holes, i.e., $k = N_h$. The presence of holes and their associated logical operators uses up the degrees of freedom associated with the patch's main boundary, so we cannot simply add the \"patch qubit\" on top of the \"hole qubits\".\n\n    *   Summary for a single patch:\n        *   With 0 holes: $k=1$ (the standard planar code).\n        *   With $N_h \\ge 1$ holes: $k = N_h$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Resources\n\nWe are given:\n*   **Two separate patches** of surface code. Since they are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded on each patch.\n*   **Two holes** in total. These two holes can be distributed between the two patches in any way.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Possible Configurations\n\nTo find the maximum number of logical qubits, we must consider all possible ways to distribute the two holes across the two patches.\n\n**Configuration 1: One hole in each patch.**\n*   **Patch A:** Has 1 hole. Based on our rule ($k=N_h$), this patch can encode **1 logical qubit**.\n*   **Patch B:** Also has 1 hole. This patch can also encode **1 logical qubit**.\n*   **Total Qubits:** The total for this configuration is the sum from both patches: $1 + 1 = 2$ logical qubits.\n\n**Configuration 2: Both holes in one patch.**\n*   **Patch A:** Has 2 holes. Based on our rule ($k=N_h$), this patch can encode **2 logical qubits**.\n*   **Patch B:** Has 0 holes. This patch is a standard planar code, which encodes **1 logical qubit**.\n*   **Total Qubits:** The total for this configuration is $2 + 1 = 3$ logical qubits.\n\n(The symmetric case of 0 holes in Patch A and 2 holes in Patch B also yields 3 logical qubits).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Maximum\n\nBy comparing the possible configurations, we can find the maximum number of logical qubits.\n*   Configuration 1 (1 hole + 1 hole) yields 2 logical qubits.\n*   Configuration 2 (2 holes + 0 holes) yields 3 logical qubits.\n\nThe maximum number is therefore 3. This is achieved by placing both holes onto a single patch and leaving the second patch as a standard, hole-free surface code.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The analysis assumes the two patches are physically separate and cannot be connected to form a single larger code. The total number of qubits is a simple sum.\n*   **Qubits from Holes vs. Patch:** A patch with holes uses its boundary to define the logical operators for the hole-based qubits. Therefore, a patch with $N_h \\ge 1$ holes encodes $k=N_h$ qubits, not $k=1+N_h$. The base case of a hole-free patch ($N_h=0$) is special and encodes $k=1$.\n*   **\"At Most\":** The question asks for the maximum possible number, which requires optimizing the distribution of the available holes.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
