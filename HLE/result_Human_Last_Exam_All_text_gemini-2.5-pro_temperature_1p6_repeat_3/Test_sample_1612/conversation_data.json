    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the MLB Batting Triple Crown**\nThe batting Triple Crown is one of the most prestigious and difficult achievements for a hitter in baseball. To win it, a player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n**Step 2: Compile a List of All Triple Crown Winning Seasons**\nWe need to list every instance where a player has met the criteria in a season recognized by Major League Baseball. This includes the American League (AL), National League (NL), and other historical leagues considered \"major\" such as the American Association (AA).\n\nHere is the chronological list of Triple Crown seasons:\n1.  **1887:** Tip O'Neill (St. Louis Browns, American Association)\n2.  **1894:** Hugh Duffy (Boston Beaneaters, National League)\n3.  **1901:** Nap Lajoie (Philadelphia Athletics, American League)\n4.  **1909:** Ty Cobb (Detroit Tigers, American League)\n5.  **1922:** Rogers Hornsby (St. Louis Cardinals, National League)\n6.  **1925:** Rogers Hornsby (St. Louis Cardinals, National League)\n7.  **1933:** Jimmie Foxx (Philadelphia Athletics, American League)\n8.  **1933:** Chuck Klein (Philadelphia Phillies, National League)\n9.  **1934:** Lou Gehrig (New York Yankees, American League)\n10. **1937:** Joe Medwick (St. Louis Cardinals, National League)\n11. **1942:** Ted Williams (Boston Red Sox, American League)\n12. **1947:** Ted Williams (Boston Red Sox, American League)\n13. **1956:** Mickey Mantle (New York Yankees, American League)\n14. **1966:** Frank Robinson (Baltimore Orioles, American League)\n15. **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski (Boston Red Sox, American League)\n16. **2012:** Miguel Cabrera (Detroit Tigers, American League)\n\n**Step 3: Identify Careful Points and Potential Confusions**\n*   **Pitching vs. Batting Triple Crown:** The question is about the more commonly referenced batting Triple Crown. There is also a pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA), but that is a separate achievement.\n*   **Unique Winners vs. Total Occurrences:** The Triple Crown has been won 16 times in MLB history. However, two players, Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, each won it twice. The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (i.e., the number of unique players), not the number of times it has been won.\n*   **Historical Accuracy (Paul Hines):** Some sources from the 19th century list Paul Hines as the 1878 NL Triple Crown winner. However, due to retroactive changes in scoring rules and disputes over his home run total from that season, MLB's official records do not recognize Hines as a Triple Crown winner. Therefore, he is not included in the official tally.\n*   **Historical Leagues (American Association):** Tip O'Neill won his Triple Crown in the American Association, which was a recognized Major League from 1882 to 1891. His achievement is officially counted in MLB's history.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Number of Unique Players (Winners)**\nBased on the list compiled in Step 2, we can identify the unique individuals who have accomplished this feat.\n\n1.  Tip O'Neill\n2.  Hugh Duffy\n3.  Nap Lajoie\n4.  Ty Cobb\n5.  Rogers Hornsby\n6.  Jimmie Foxx\n7.  Chuck Klein\n8.  Lou Gehrig\n9.  Joe Medwick\n10. Ted Williams\n11. Mickey Mantle\n12. Frank Robinson\n13. Carl Yastrzemski\n14. Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting the names on this list gives us the final number of unique Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Final Answer\nBy counting the unique players in the list above, we find there are 14 individual players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<14>>>"
