    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category from an object $A$ to an object $B$ is given by a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$, along with 2-morphisms for the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\to R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_B$, satisfying the triangle identities. We will analyze the problem by breaking it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Unpacking the definitions for the simplex category $\\Delta$**\n\nThe simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, has:\n*   **Objects:** Finite ordered sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for integers $n \\ge 0$. In this problem, the objects are $A = [23]$ and $B = [37]$.\n*   **1-Morphisms:** Order-preserving maps. An internal adjunction involves two 1-morphisms, $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$, which must be order-preserving.\n*   **2-Morphisms:** For any two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f \\le g$, which means $f(k) \\le g(k)$ for all $k \\in [m]$.\n\nThe unit and counit of the adjunction are 2-morphisms, which translate to the following pointwise inequalities:\n*   Unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\to R \\circ L$: This means $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$, which simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n*   Counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$: This means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThese two conditions, $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$, are precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $[23]$ and $[37]$, where $L$ is the left adjoint to $R$ (denoted $L \\dashv R$).\n\nIn a locally posetal 2-category, the triangle identities for the adjunction are automatically satisfied if the unit and counit exist. Thus, we just need to count the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $(L, R)$ that form a Galois connection.\n\n**Step 2: Characterizing the adjoint maps**\n\nIn a Galois connection $L \\dashv R$, the map $L$ uniquely determines $R$, and vice-versa. Therefore, we can count the number of such adjunctions by counting the number of possible left adjoint maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ (or right adjoint maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$).\n\nWe use the Adjoint Functor Theorem for posets, which states that a map between complete lattices has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins).\nThe posets $[m]$ are finite total orders, hence they are complete lattices.\n*   The supremum of a non-empty subset of $[m]$ is its maximum element.\n*   The supremum of the empty set in $[m]$ is the bottom element, which is $0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ automatically preserves maxima of non-empty sets. For $L$ to preserve *all* suprema, it must also preserve the supremum of the empty set. This gives the condition:\n$L(\\sup_{[m]} \\emptyset) = \\sup_{[n]} L(\\emptyset)$\nIn our posets, this translates to:\n$L(0) = 0$\n\nSo, an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint (i.e., has a right adjoint) if and only if $L(0) = 0$.\n\nSymmetrically, a map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint (i.e., has a left adjoint) if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). The infimum of the empty set in $[k]$ is the top element, $k$. The condition $R(\\inf_{[n]} \\emptyset) = \\inf_{[m]} R(\\emptyset)$ translates to:\n$R(n) = m$\n\nSo, the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the maps**\n\nWe need to count the number of sequences $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ satisfying:\n1.  $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$ (order-preserving)\n2.  $0 \\le L(i) \\le 37$ for all $i \\in [23]$ (codomain is [37])\n3.  $L(0) = 0$ (left adjoint condition)\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. The problem reduces to counting the number of sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using \"stars and bars\". We are choosing $k=23$ values (for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from a set of $N=38$ possible numbers ($\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$), with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as they will be arranged in a non-decreasing sequence).\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} $$\nHere, $k=23$ (the number of values we need to choose) and $N=38$ (the number of options for each value).\nPlugging in the numbers:\n$$ \\text{Number of maps} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nTo double-check, we could also count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ satisfying $R(37) = 23$. This means we need to choose the values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ such that $0 \\le R(0) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$. Here, $k=37$ and $N=24$ (options from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$). The number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$. Since $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, confirming our result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is therefore $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<2451578229347895400>>>"
