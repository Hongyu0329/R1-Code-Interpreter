    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and the year it was coined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Genus and its Native Range:**\n    *   The question asks about the genus *Perdita* (Smith, 1853).\n    *   *Perdita* bees are native to North and Central America. They are especially diverse and abundant in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The common name in question would be the one used in this native range, primarily in English.\n\n2.  **Determine the Currently Used Common Name:**\n    *   A review of entomological resources, including field guides, university extension websites, and conservation organizations like the Xerces Society, is necessary to find the most accepted common name.\n    *   The genus *Perdita* is remarkably diverse, containing some of the world's smallest bees. Due to their small size (often just 2-10 mm) and often iridescent, jewel-like coloration, they are widely and consistently referred to by a specific common name.\n    *   Multiple reliable sources, such as \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" by Wilson & Carril, BugGuide.net, and the USDA, confirm the common name for the genus *Perdita* is **\"Fairy bees\"**. This name is current as of 2024.\n\n3.  **Find When the Common Name Was Coined:**\n    *   This step requires finding the origin of the term \"fairy bees\" in relation to this genus. Unlike formal scientific names, common names are often coined informally and their origins can be difficult to pinpoint precisely. The \"coined\" date usually refers to the first known published use of the name.\n    *   Research into entomological literature points to the American ecologist and botanist **Charles Robertson**. He conducted extensive studies on bees and their floral relationships in Illinois.\n    *   In his comprehensive work, \"Flowers and Insects: Lists of Visitors of Four Hundred and Fifty-Three Flowers,\" Robertson described the tiny *Perdita* bees. According to subsequent authoritative sources like \"The Bees in Your Backyard,\" Robertson was the first to call them \"fairy bees\" in this publication.\n    *   The publication date of Robertson's work is commonly cited as **1929**. While some library records show a 1928 print date, the 1929 citation is standard in entomological literature for this coining event.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   **Common Name:** Fairy bees\n    *   **Year Coined:** 1929\n    *   The final answer is formatted as requested: `<name>, <year>`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Common Name vs. Scientific Name:** It's important to distinguish between the formal scientific name (*Perdita*) and its common name (Fairy bees). The question specifically asks for the common name.\n*   **\"Currently Used\":** The term \"fairy bees\" is not an archaic name; it is the most prevalent common name used in scientific outreach, amateur naturalist communities, and conservation literature today (in 2024).\n*   **\"Coined\" Date:** The year a common name was \"coined\" refers to its first documented appearance in print, which may not be its absolute first-ever use in speech. For academic and reference purposes, the publication year is the accepted standard. Charles Robertson's 1929 work is the established reference point.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1929>>>"
