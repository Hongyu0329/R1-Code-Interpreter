    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. For the purposes of natural abundance on Earth, these are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n*(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth and is therefore not a candidate.)*\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\" in the year 2002.\n*   **\"Terrestrial matter\"** includes the Earth's atmosphere, crust, mantle, and oceans. The abundance must be considered across all these parts.\n*   **\"Rarest\"** means having the lowest concentration or the smallest total mass at any given time.\n*   **\"in 2002\"**: The relative abundances of these gases are determined by geological and physical processes that occur over millions or billions of years. The ranking of their abundance would not have been different in 2002 than it is today. This date is not a critical factor in changing the outcome.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Abundances of Stable Noble Gases**\nMost of the noble gases on Earth are concentrated in the atmosphere. Let's look at their atmospheric abundance, which is a good starting point for their overall rarity.\n*   **Argon (Ar):** By far the most common noble gas, making up about 0.934% (9340 parts per million, ppm) of the atmosphere. It is continuously produced by the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The next most common, at about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** Although constantly produced by radioactive decay in the crust, its low mass allows it to escape Earth's gravity into space. Its atmospheric concentration is stable but low, at about 5.2 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer, at about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the *stable* noble gases, with an atmospheric concentration of only about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n\nBased on this, Xenon is the rarest of the stable noble gases. Now we must consider the final candidate, Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is fundamentally different from the other noble gases because it is highly radioactive.\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element from Earth's formation. It is constantly being formed as an intermediate step in the radioactive decay chains of uranium and thorium, which are present in rocks and soil.\n*   **Decay:** The most stable isotope of radon, radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Accumulation:** Because radon decays almost as quickly as it is formed, it cannot accumulate in the environment. At any given moment, the total amount of radon gas across the entire planet (in the crust, atmosphere, and water) is incredibly small.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude by Comparing Xenon and Radon**\n*   **Xenon (Xe)** is stable. While its concentration is very low, the total mass of xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be over a trillion kilograms (10^12 kg).\n*   **Radon (Rn)** is transient. Because of its 3.8-day half-life, its total mass on Earth at any single moment is estimated to be only a few tens of kilograms.\n\nEven though radon is constantly being produced, its rapid decay means its standing quantity as a percentage of all terrestrial matter is orders of magnitude lower than that of xenon. Therefore, radon is unequivocally the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
