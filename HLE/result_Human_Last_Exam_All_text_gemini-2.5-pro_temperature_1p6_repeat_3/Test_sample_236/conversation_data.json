    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Homology Cobordism Group and Integral Surgery**\n\n*   The **homology cobordism group**, denoted $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$, consists of oriented integral homology 3-spheres under the equivalence relation of homology cobordism. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   An **integral surgery** on a knot $K$ in $S^3$ produces a 3-manifold $S^3_p(K)$, where $p$ is an integer framing coefficient.\n*   For $S^3_p(K)$ to be an **integral homology sphere** (i.e., its first homology group $H_1$ is trivial), we require $|p|=1$. Thus, we are only concerned with surgeries with coefficients $p=+1$ and $p=-1$.\n\n**2. Identifying Knots with At Most Four Crossings**\n\nWe list the distinct knots (up to mirror images) with a crossing number of 4 or less:\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$). This knot is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no knots.\n*   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral; its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil, is distinct. We will denote the right-handed trefoil by $3_1$ and the left-handed trefoil by $-3_1$.\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral.\n\nSo, the full list of knots we need to consider is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $-3_1$, and $4_1$.\n\n**3. Listing the Resulting Homology Spheres**\n\nWe perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of these four knots, generating a list of potential homology spheres:\n*   Surgery on the unknot ($0_1$):\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$\n*   Surgery on the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$):\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$ (This is the Poincaré homology sphere)\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ (This is the Seifert fibered space $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$)\n*   Surgery on the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$):\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$\n*   Surgery on the figure-eight knot ($4_1$):\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$\n\nThere is a useful identity relating surgery on a knot and its mirror: $S^3_p(-K) \\cong -S^3_{-p}(K)$, where $-M$ denotes the manifold $M$ with its orientation reversed. Applying this:\n*   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1) \\cong -S^3_{-1}(3_1)$\n*   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(3_1)$\n\n**4. Using Invariants to Distinguish Homology Cobordism Classes**\n\nTo count the distinct elements in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$, we need to determine which of these manifolds are homology cobordant. A key invariant is the **Casson invariant**, $\\lambda(M)$, which is an integer-valued invariant of homology spheres that is preserved by homology cobordism.\n\nThe Casson invariant for surgery on a knot $K$ is given by $\\lambda(S^3_p(K)) = \\frac{p}{2} \\Delta_K''(1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of $K$.\n\nLet's compute the Casson invariants for our manifolds:\n*   **Unknot ($0_1$)**: $\\Delta_{0_1}(t)=1$, so $\\Delta_{0_1}''(1)=0$. Thus, $\\lambda(S^3_{\\pm 1}(0_1)) = 0$.\n*   **Trefoil ($3_1$ or $-3_1$)**: $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t^{-1} - 1 + t$. The second derivative at $t=1$ is $\\Delta_{3_1}''(1) = 2$. The Alexander polynomial is the same for a knot and its mirror.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = \\frac{+1}{2}(2) = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = \\frac{-1}{2}(2) = -1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(-3_1)) = \\frac{+1}{2}(2) = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(-3_1)) = \\frac{-1}{2}(2) = -1$.\n*   **Figure-eight ($4_1$)**: $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = -t^{-1} + 3 - t$. The second derivative at $t=1$ is $\\Delta_{4_1}''(1) = -2$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = \\frac{+1}{2}(-2) = -1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = \\frac{-1}{2}(-2) = 1$.\n\n**5. Grouping by Casson Invariant and Final Count**\n\nWe can group the resulting homology spheres by their Casson invariant. Manifolds with different Casson invariants represent distinct elements in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **$\\lambda = 0$:**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ both give $S^3$, the identity element.\n    *   This gives **1 element**.\n\n*   **$\\lambda = 1$:**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$ (Poincaré sphere)\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$ (which is $-S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,7)$)\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ (a hyperbolic manifold)\n    *   These three manifolds are known to be topologically distinct. A deep result in low-dimensional topology, established using invariants from gauge theory or Heegaard Floer homology, shows that they are also distinct in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   This gives **3 distinct elements**.\n\n*   **$\\lambda = -1$:**\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ (which is $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$)\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$ (which is $-S^3_{+1}(3_1) = -\\text{Poincaré sphere}$)\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$\n    *   These three elements are the inverses (orientation-reversals) of the three elements in the $\\lambda=1$ group. Since the elements in the $\\lambda=1$ group are distinct and have a non-trivial Rokhlin invariant ($\\mu=\\lambda \\pmod 2 = 1$), they are not of order 2, so their inverses are distinct from them and from each other.\n    *   This gives another **3 distinct elements**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTotalling the elements from each group:\n*   1 element with $\\lambda = 0$ (the identity).\n*   3 distinct elements with $\\lambda = 1$.\n*   3 distinct elements with $\\lambda = -1$.\n\nTotal number of elements = $1 + 3 + 3 = 7$.\n\nFinal list of the distinct elements identified:\n1.  $[S^3]$\n2.  $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$\n3.  $[S^3_{+1}(-3_1)]$\n4.  $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$\n5.  $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$\n6.  $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$\n7.  $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$\n\nFinal Answer: There are 7 such elements.\n\n<<<7>>>"
