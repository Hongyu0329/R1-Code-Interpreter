The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int_{\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)} \mathcal{D}[\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)] \, \exp\left(-\int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \psi^*(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi(\tau) + H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]\right)$, where $\psi, \psi^*$ are anti-commuting Grassmann fields, the integral is over all paths satisfying the anti-periodic boundary condition $\psi(\beta)=-\psi(0)$, and $H(\psi^*, \psi)$ is the symbol of the normal-ordered Hamiltonian.
