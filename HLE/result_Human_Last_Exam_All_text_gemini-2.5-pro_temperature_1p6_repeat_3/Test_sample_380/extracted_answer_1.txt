The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered to be radial; it follows the Parker Spiral and is typically oriented at about 45 degrees to the radial direction. The reason for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., $\delta B_Y$ and $\delta B_Z$) is not based on the direction of the magnetic field, but on an approximation known as the **Taylor Hypothesis**. This hypothesis states that for a stationary spacecraft in a fast-flowing plasma like the solar wind, the measured time variations are dominated by the convection of spatial structures past the spacecraft. Since the solar wind velocity is predominantly radial, the *apparent* direction of wave propagation from the spacecraft's perspective is assumed to be radial. Therefore, the helicity is calculated in the plane perpendicular to this apparent radial propagation direction. This is a widely used practical simplification, although more rigorous analyses will transform the data into a coordinate system aligned with the local magnetic field before calculating helicity.
