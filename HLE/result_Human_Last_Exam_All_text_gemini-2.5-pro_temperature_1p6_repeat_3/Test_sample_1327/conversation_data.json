    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence and its basic properties**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's first try to find the difference between consecutive terms.\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no simple arithmetic or geometric pattern in this sequence of differences.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a recurrence relation**\nSince the terms are growing relatively fast, let's look for a pattern of the form `a(n) = k * a(n-1) Â± C`, where `a(n)` is the nth term and `C` might be a constant or part of another sequence.\n\n*   **Test with k=2:**\n    *   `2 * 2 = 4`. To get 11, we add 7.  (11 = 2 * 2 + 7)\n    *   `2 * 11 = 22`. To get 23, we add 1. (23 = 2 * 11 + 1)\n    *   `2 * 23 = 46`. To get 51, we add 5. (51 = 2 * 23 + 5)\n    *   `2 * 51 = 102`. To get 119, we add 17. (119 = 2 * 51 + 17)\n    The sequence of added numbers is 7, 1, 5, 17. This does not reveal a simple, obvious pattern.\n\n*   **Test with k=3:**\n    *   `3 * 2 = 6`. To get 11, we add 5, or subtract -5. (11 = 3 * 2 - (-5))\n    *   `3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we subtract 10. (23 = 3 * 11 - 10)\n    *   `3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we subtract 18. (51 = 3 * 23 - 18)\n    *   `3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we subtract 34. (119 = 3 * 51 - 34)\n    This gives us a recurrence relation `a(n) = 3 * a(n-1) - d(n)`, where `d(n)` is the sequence of numbers we subtract: `{-5, 10, 18, 34, ...}`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the new sequence `d(n)`**\nThe sequence of subtracted numbers is `d(n) = {-5, 10, 18, 34, ...}`. Often in such problems, the pattern does not apply to the first term. Let's analyze the sequence starting from the second term: `10, 18, 34, ...`\nLet's find the difference between the terms in this new sequence.\n*   18 - 10 = 8\n*   34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences are 8, 16. This is a clear geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the next term in the sequence of differences**\nThe next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the next term in the sequence `d(n)`**\nThe next term `d(6)` will be the previous term `d(5)` plus the next difference.\n`d(6) = d(5) + 32 = 34 + 32 = 66`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence**\nNow we use the rule we found in Step 2: `a(n) = 3 * a(n-1) - d(n)`.\nWe need to find `a(6)`.\n`a(6) = 3 * a(5) - d(6)`\n`a(6) = 3 * 119 - 66`\n`a(6) = 357 - 66`\n`a(6) = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   A simple difference or ratio may not work; it's essential to check for more complex recurrence relations.\n*   When a new sequence is derived (like the subtracted amounts `d(n)`), the pattern might not start from the very first element. It's common for a pattern to \"stabilize\" after one or two terms.\n*   Ensure all calculations are performed accurately, as a small error can lead to a wrong conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The sequence `a(n)` is defined by the rule `a(n) = 3 * a(n-1) - d(n)`.\n2.  The sequence of subtracted numbers `d(n)` is `{-5, 10, 18, 34, ...}`.\n3.  The pattern in `d(n)` (ignoring the first term) is that the differences between consecutive terms double each time (8, 16, 32...).\n4.  The next term in `d(n)` is `d(6) = 34 + 32 = 66`.\n5.  The next term in `a(n)` is `a(6) = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
