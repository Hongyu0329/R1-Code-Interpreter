    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial and identify its irreducible factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to rearrange the terms to find a common factor.\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\nThe polynomial $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (e.g., by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$). Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe polynomial $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n- The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3.\n- All other coefficients (-9, 3) are divisible by 3.\n- The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n\nSo, the irreducible factors of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $x^2-2$ and $x^5-9x+3$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of each irreducible factor.**\n\nLet $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)=x^2-2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and its Galois group is $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nLet $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. To determine which subgroup it is, we analyze the roots of $g(x)$.\nThe derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n$g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5) - 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5-9) + 3 = -\\frac{36}{5}(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 < 0$.\n$g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)^{1/4}(9/5) + 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = \\frac{36}{5}(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 > 0$.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and thus one pair of complex conjugate roots.\nThe complex conjugation acts as a transposition on the roots. So $G_g$ is a subgroup of $S_5$ containing a transposition.\nAlso, we can consider $g(x)$ modulo 2: $g(x) \\equiv x^5+x+1 \\pmod{2}$. This polynomial factors as $(x^2+x+1)(x^3+x^2+1)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$. Since the discriminant of $g(x)$ is not divisible by 2, Dedekind's theorem implies that $G_g$ contains a permutation of cycle type (2,3). An element of this type has order 6 (e.g., (12)(345)).\nA transitive subgroup of $S_5$ containing a transposition and an element of order 6 must be the full symmetric group $S_5$.\nThus, $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field K.**\n\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = K_g K_h$, the compositum of the splitting fields $K_g$ and $K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe isomorphism $G \\cong G_g \\times G_h$ holds if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The intersection is non-trivial if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq K_g$.\nA quadratic subfield of $K_g$ corresponds to a subgroup of $G_g=S_5$ of index 2. The only such subgroup is the alternating group $A_5$. Since $A_5$ is a normal subgroup of $S_5$, the corresponding quadratic extension is normal over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+px+q$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}[n^n q^{n-1} + (-(n-1))^{n-1} p^n]$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5-9x+3$, we have $n=5, p=-9, q=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10}[5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-4)^4 \\cdot (-9)^5] = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256(-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\nFor this to be equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we would need $-14863419 / 2$ to be the square of a rational number, which is impossible as it is negative.\nSo, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\not\\subseteq K_g$, which means $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G \\cong G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe order of $G$ is $|G| = |S_5| \\cdot |C_2| = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of G.**\n\nWe need to find the degrees of normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, this is equivalent to finding the indices $[G:H]$ of all normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ such that $\\{1\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nLet $G_1 = S_5$ and $G_2 = C_2$. The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{1\\}, A_5, S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{1\\}, C_2$.\nBecause the composition factors of $S_5$ (which are $A_5$ and $C_2$) and $C_2$ are not disjoint, we must consider \"diagonal\" subgroups in addition to the products of normal subgroups.\nA complete analysis of the normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ (using Goursat's Lemma for instance) yields the following complete list of proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$:\n1.  $H_1 = \\{1\\} \\times C_2$. Here $|H_1|=2$.\n2.  $H_2 = A_5 \\times \\{1\\}$. Here $|H_2|=60$.\n3.  $H_3 = S_5 \\times \\{1\\}$. Here $|H_3|=120$.\n4.  $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$. Here $|H_4|=120$.\n5.  $H_5 = \\{ (\\sigma, \\tau) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = \\tau \\}$. This is a \"diagonal\" subgroup. Let's explain: let $C_2 = \\{1, -1\\}$ multiplicatively. Then $\\tau \\in C_2$ and $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$. This is a normal subgroup of order $|A_5| \\times 1 + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| \\times 1 = 60+60=120$. So $|H_5|=120$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the indices of these normal subgroups.**\n\nThe degree of the corresponding normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[G:H]=|G|/|H|=240/|H|$.\n1.  For $H_1$, index is $240/2 = 120$.\n2.  For $H_2$, index is $240/60 = 4$.\n3.  For $H_3$, index is $240/120 = 2$.\n4.  For $H_4$, index is $240/120 = 2$.\n5.  For $H_5$, index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees is the set of these index values.\nThe distinct values for the degrees are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe possible degrees of normal field extensions $L / \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are the indices of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. These degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
