    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the terms: upper semilattice, tame functor, and n-resolvable functor in the context of homological algebra.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice (J):** A partially ordered set (poset) $J$ where for any two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, their least upper bound (supremum or join), denoted $j_1 \\vee j_2$, exists in $J$. When viewed as a category, this means any pair of objects has a coproduct.\n    *   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\to j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ for every relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, respecting composition. The collection of all such functors forms an abelian category, denoted $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   **n-resolvable:** A functor (or more generally, an object in an abelian category) is called $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence $0 \\to P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$, where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category. The smallest such $n$ is the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$.\n    *   **Tame Functor:** In the context of the representation theory of posets, \"tame\" refers to a classification of the representation type. A poset (or an algebra) is of tame representation type if its indecomposable representations can be classified into a finite number of one-parameter families (plus a finite number of discrete indecomposables). A \"tame functor\" is an indecomposable representation of a poset of tame representation type. The question could also be interpreted as asking about any functor on an arbitrary upper semilattice, with \"tame\" being extraneous information, or a restriction that we must carefully consider.\n\n2.  **The Core of the Problem:**\n    The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ such that *any* tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable. This means we are looking for the maximum possible projective dimension of a tame functor on an upper semilattice. We can approach this by finding the global dimension of the functor category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, which is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects in the category. If we can bound this for *any* functor, the bound will also apply to tame functors.\n\n3.  **Homological Properties of Functors on an Upper Semilattice:**\n    *   The projective objects in $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ are direct sums of representable functors $P_j(-) = K \\cdot \\text{Hom}_J(j, -)$.\n    *   The global dimension of the category is the supremum of the projective dimensions of the simple functors $S_j$. A simple functor $S_j$ is non-zero only at $j$ (in a specific quotient sense). It can be defined as $S_j = P_j / \\text{rad}(P_j)$, where $\\text{rad}(P_j)$ is the radical of $P_j$.\n    *   We can construct a projective resolution for any simple functor $S_j$.\n        1.  Start with the natural projection $P_j \\to S_j$. This is the start of our resolution: $\\dots \\to P_j \\to S_j \\to 0$. The kernel is $\\text{rad}(P_j)$.\n        2.  The next step is to find a projective cover for $\\text{rad}(P_j)$. The radical $\\text{rad}(P_j)$ is generated by the images of maps coming from elements \"above\" $j$. More formally, let $J_{>j}^{(1)}$ be the set of minimal elements in $J$ that are strictly greater than $j$. There is a natural epimorphism from the projective functor $\\bigoplus_{k \\in J_{>j}^{(1)}} P_k$ onto $\\text{rad}(P_j)$. This gives us the second step of the resolution: $\\dots \\to \\bigoplus_{k \\in J_{>j}^{(1)}} P_k \\xrightarrow{d_1} P_j \\to S_j \\to 0$.\n        3.  Now, we must analyze the kernel of $d_1$, let's call it $K_1 = \\ker(d_1)$. This is where the upper semilattice property is crucial. For any two distinct elements $k_1, k_2 \\in J_{>j}^{(1)}$, their join $k_1 \\vee k_2$ exists. The structure of the category $J$ induces a pullback diagram for the corresponding representable functors:\n            $P_{k_1 \\vee k_2} \\cong P_{k_1} \\times_{P_j} P_{k_2}$.\n            This implies that the kernel of the map $P_{k_1} \\oplus P_{k_2} \\to P_j$ is the projective functor $P_{k_1 \\vee k_2}$.\n        4.  This property shows that the kernel $K_1$ is generated by projective functors of the form $P_{k_1 \\vee k_2}$. Therefore, there is an epimorphism from the projective functor $\\bigoplus_{k_1, k_2 \\in J_{>j}^{(1)}} P_{k_1 \\vee k_2}$ onto $K_1$.\n    *   This completes a projective resolution for $S_j$ of length 2:\n        $\\bigoplus_{k_1, k_2 \\in J_{>j}^{(1)}} P_{k_1 \\vee k_2} \\to \\bigoplus_{k \\in J_{>j}^{(1)}} P_k \\to P_j \\to S_j \\to 0$.\n    *   This demonstrates that $\\text{pd}(S_j) \\le 2$ for any simple functor $S_j$. Standard theorems in homological algebra allow us to conclude that the projective dimension of any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is at most 2. Thus, any functor is 2-resolvable.\n\n4.  **Checking if the Bound is Sharp (Is n=2 Necessary?):**\n    *   We need to determine if a functor with projective dimension 2 can actually exist. If so, $n$ cannot be 0 or 1.\n    *   Consider the \"diamond\" poset: $J = \\{\\bot, a, b, \\top\\}$ with relations $\\bot < a < \\top$ and $\\bot < b < \\top$. This is an upper semilattice (and also a lower semilattice, i.e., a lattice). Here $a \\vee b = \\top$.\n    *   Let's analyze the projective dimension of the simple functor $S_\\bot$. Following the resolution above, we have:\n        $P_{a \\vee b} \\to P_a \\oplus P_b \\to P_\\bot \\to S_\\bot \\to 0$.\n        This simplifies to $P_\\top \\to P_a \\oplus P_b \\to P_\\bot \\to S_\\bot \\to 0$.\n    *   The projective dimension of $S_\\bot$ is 2 unless the kernel of $P_a \\oplus P_b \\to P_\\bot$ (which is $\\text{rad}(P_\\bot)$) is itself a projective functor.\n    *   This kernel is isomorphic to $P_{a \\vee b} = P_\\top$, which *is* a projective functor.\n    *   So, for $S_\\bot$, we have a short exact sequence $0 \\to \\text{rad}(P_\\bot) \\to P_\\bot \\to S_\\bot \\to 0$. Since $\\text{rad}(P_\\bot) \\cong P_\\top$ is projective, by definition, $\\text{pd}(S_\\bot) = 1 + \\text{pd}(\\text{rad}(P_\\bot)) = 1 + 0 = 1$. Let me re-evaluate.\n    *   The sequence is $0 \\to K_1 \\to \\bigoplus P_k \\to \\text{rad}(P_\\bot) \\to 0$. If $K_1$ is projective, then $\\text{pd}(\\text{rad}(P_\\bot)) \\le 1$. And $pd(S_\\bot) = 1 + pd(\\text{rad}(P_\\bot))$.\n    *   Let's check the resolution again. The resolution is $\\dots \\to P_2 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$. $\\text{pd}(M)$ is the minimal length.\n    *   For $S_\\bot$: $0 \\to P_{a\\vee b} \\to P_a \\oplus P_b \\to P_\\bot \\to S_\\bot \\to 0$ is an exact sequence of functors. Since all three objects to the left of $S_\\bot$ are projective, this is a projective resolution of length 2. Thus $\\text{pd}(S_\\bot) \\le 2$.\n    *   Is $\\text{pd}(S_\\bot)$ smaller? If $\\text{pd}(S_\\bot) \\le 1$, then there exists a short exact sequence $0 \\to Q_1 \\to Q_0 \\to S_\\bot \\to 0$ with $Q_1, Q_0$ projective. This would imply $\\text{Ext}^2(S_\\bot, -)=0$. However, it can be shown that $\\text{Ext}^2(S_\\bot, S_\\bot) \\neq 0$ for the diamond lattice. Therefore, $\\text{pd}(S_\\bot) = 2$.\n    *   So, a functor with projective dimension 2 exists.\n\n5.  **The Role of \"Tame Functor\":**\n    *   The final point is to check if the \"tame\" condition restricts the dimension.\n    *   The diamond poset is known to be of **tame representation type**. This means all its indecomposable representations (functors) are, by definition, \"tame functors\".\n    *   The simple functor $S_\\bot$ is indecomposable. Therefore, $S_\\bot$ is a tame functor.\n    *   Since we have found an example of a tame functor ($S_\\bot$ on the diamond lattice) with projective dimension 2, the bound $n=2$ is necessary.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe projective dimension of any functor on an upper semilattice is at most 2. There exists an upper semilattice of tame representation type (the diamond lattice) which has a tame functor ($S_\\bot$) with projective dimension exactly 2. Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which any tame functor is $n$-resolvable is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
