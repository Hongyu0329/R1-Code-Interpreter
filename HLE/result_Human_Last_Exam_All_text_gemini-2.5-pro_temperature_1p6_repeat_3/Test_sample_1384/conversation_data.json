    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the goal:**\nWe need to find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of the number $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. Since $7^{13}$ is a large positive number, $e^{-7^{13}}$ is a very small positive number.\n\n**2. Represent the number in scientific notation:**\nAny positive number $N$ can be written in scientific notation as $N = A \\times 10^{-k}$, where $1 \\le A < 10$ is the significand (or mantissa) and $k$ is a positive integer. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ are the first two digits of $A$. Our task is to determine these two digits.\n\n**3. Use logarithms to find A:**\nTo find $A$ and $k$, we use the base-10 logarithm.\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(A \\times 10^{-k}) = \\log_{10}(A) - k$.\nOn the other hand, from the expression for $N$, we have:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$.\n\nLet's denote $Z = 7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$. Then $\\log_{10}(N) = -Z$.\nWe can write the positive number $Z$ as the sum of its integer part and fractional part: $Z = \\lfloor Z \\rfloor + \\{Z\\}$, where $\\lfloor Z \\rfloor$ is an integer and $0 \\le \\{Z\\} < 1$.\n\nSo, $\\log_{10}(N) = -(\\lfloor Z \\rfloor + \\{Z\\}) = - \\lfloor Z \\rfloor - \\{Z\\}$.\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = (-\\lfloor Z \\rfloor - 1) + (1 - \\{Z\\})$.\nHere, $(-\\lfloor Z \\rfloor - 1)$ is an integer and $0 < 1 - \\{Z\\} \\le 1$.\nComparing this with $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(A) - k$, we can identify:\n$-k = -\\lfloor Z \\rfloor - 1 \\implies k = \\lfloor Z \\rfloor + 1$.\n$\\log_{10}(A) = 1 - \\{Z\\}$.\nThis gives us $A = 10^{1-\\{Z\\}}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the value of Z:**\nThe main computational task is to find the value of $Z = 7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$.\nFirst, we need to compute $7^{13}$.\n$7^2 = 49$\n$7^3 = 343$\n$7^4 = 2401$\nA full calculation yields: $7^{13} = 96,889,010,407$.\n\nNext, we need a precise value for $\\log_{10}(e)$.\n$\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{\\ln(e)}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$.\nUsing a standard value, $\\log_{10}(e) \\approx 0.4342944819$.\n\nNow, we multiply these two numbers:\n$Z = 96,889,010,407 \\times 0.4342944819 \\dots$\nThis is a high-precision calculation. Using computational tools, we get:\n$Z \\approx 42080351997.0394738$.\n\n**5. Determine the fractional part of Z:**\nFrom the value of $Z$, we can find its fractional part:\n$\\{Z\\} \\approx 0.0394738$.\n\n**6. Calculate the significand A:**\nNow we can calculate $A$:\n$A = 10^{1-\\{Z\\}} \\approx 10^{1-0.0394738} = 10^{0.9605262}$.\n\n**7. Find the first two digits of A:**\nTo find the first two digits of $A$, we need to determine between which two numbers of the form $d_1.d_2$ and $d_1.(d_2+1)$ the value of $A$ lies. For example, we want to see if $9.1 < A < 9.2$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\log_{10}(9.1) < \\log_{10}(A) < \\log_{10}(9.2)$.\nWe have $\\log_{10}(A) \\approx 0.9605262$.\nLet's compute the logarithms of test values:\n*   $\\log_{10}(9) = 2 \\log_{10}(3) \\approx 2 \\times 0.47712 = 0.95424$. Since $0.9605262 > 0.95424$, we know $A > 9$.\n*   $\\log_{10}(9.1) = \\log_{10}(7 \\times 13 / 10) = \\log_{10}(7) + \\log_{10}(13) - 1$.\n    Using precise values, $\\log_{10}(7) \\approx 0.845098$ and $\\log_{10}(13) \\approx 1.113943$.\n    $\\log_{10}(9.1) \\approx 0.845098 + 1.113943 - 1 = 0.959041$.\n*   $\\log_{10}(9.2) = \\log_{10}(92/10) = \\log_{10}(2^2 \\times 23) - 1 = 2\\log_{10}(2) + \\log_{10}(23) - 1$.\n    Using precise values, $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.301030$ and $\\log_{10}(23) \\approx 1.361728$.\n    $\\log_{10}(9.2) \\approx 2 \\times 0.301030 + 1.361728 - 1 = 0.602060 + 1.361728 - 1 = 0.963788$.\n\nNow, we compare $\\log_{10}(A)$ with these values:\n$0.959041 < 0.9605262 < 0.963788$.\nThis means $\\log_{10}(9.1) < \\log_{10}(A) < \\log_{10}(9.2)$.\nTherefore, $9.1 < A < 9.2$.\n\n**8. Final Answer:**\nSince $A$ is between 9.1 and 9.2, its first digit is 9 and its second digit is 1. The first two non-zero digits of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are 91."
