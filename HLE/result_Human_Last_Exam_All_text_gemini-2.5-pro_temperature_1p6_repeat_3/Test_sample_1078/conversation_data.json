    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concept**\n\nThe classification of finite Weyl groups is directly tied to the classification of irreducible root systems, which in turn are represented by connected Dynkin diagrams. The **rank** of a Weyl group corresponds to the number of vertices (or nodes) in its associated Dynkin diagram. The question asks for the number of **non-isomorphic** groups, which means we are looking for structurally distinct groups. This is equivalent to finding the number of distinct types of irreducible root systems of rank 4.\n\n**2. The Classification of Finite Irreducible Weyl Groups**\n\nFinite irreducible Weyl groups are classified by the following families of connected Dynkin diagrams. The subscript `n` denotes the rank (number of nodes).\n\n*   **A_n** (for n ≥ 1)\n*   **B_n** (for n ≥ 2)\n*   **C_n** (for n ≥ 3)\n*   **D_n** (for n ≥ 4)\n*   **E_6, E_7, E_8** (Exceptional, ranks 6, 7, 8)\n*   **F_4** (Exceptional, rank 4)\n*   **G_2** (Exceptional, rank 2)\n\n**3. Identifying Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nWe need to go through the list above and find all the families that can have a rank of 4.\n\n*   **A_n:** For n=4, we get the diagram **A_4**. This represents one type of Weyl group, W(A_4).\n*   **B_n/C_n:** For n=4, we get the diagrams **B_4** and **C_4**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The Weyl groups for B_n and C_n are always isomorphic for n ≥ 2. That is, W(B_n) ≅ W(C_n). Therefore, B_4 and C_4 give us only **one** unique non-isomorphic Weyl group, which we can call W(B_4).\n*   **D_n:** For n=4, we get the diagram **D_4**. This represents the Weyl group W(D_4).\n*   **E_n:** The exceptional groups E_6, E_7, and E_8 have ranks 6, 7, and 8 respectively. None of them have a rank of 4.\n*   **F_n:** The exceptional group **F_4** is, by definition, a group of rank 4. This gives us the Weyl group W(F_4).\n*   **G_n:** The exceptional group G_2 has a rank of 2, not 4.\n\n**4. Listing the Candidates**\n\nFrom the previous step, we have identified four distinct Dynkin diagrams of rank 4 that correspond to potentially different Weyl groups:\n1.  **A_4**\n2.  **B_4** (representing the isomorphic class of W(B_4) and W(C_4))\n3.  **D_4**\n4.  **F_4**\n\n**5. Verifying They are Non-isomorphic**\n\nAccording to the classification theorem, Weyl groups corresponding to different types of Dynkin diagrams (from the list A, B, D, F) are non-isomorphic. We can quickly verify this by comparing the orders (the number of elements) of these groups. If the orders are different, the groups cannot be isomorphic.\n\n*   Order of W(A_n) = (n+1)!\n    *   |W(A_4)| = (4+1)! = 5! = 120\n*   Order of W(B_n) = 2^n * n!\n    *   |W(B_4)| = 2^4 * 4! = 16 * 24 = 384\n*   Order of W(D_n) = 2^(n-1) * n!\n    *   |W(D_4)| = 2^(4-1) * 4! = 8 * 24 = 192\n*   Order of W(F_4) is a known value:\n    *   |W(F_4)| = 1152\n\nSince the orders of these four groups (120, 384, 192, and 1152) are all different, the groups must be non-isomorphic.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThere are exactly four distinct types of connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes, which correspond to four non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups. These are A_4, B_4, D_4, and F_4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
