    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The (1S,2R) configuration indicates the substituents are on opposite sides of the ring plane, making it a *trans* isomer.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). This is a polar protic solvent, which is the conjugate acid of the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an elimination reaction. Because the base is strong, the mechanism will be E2 (bimolecular elimination).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Elimination**\nThe E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, Br) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an *anti-periplanar* orientation. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must both be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one pointing up, the other down). This is called a *trans-diaxial* arrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\nThe substrate is *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. Like any trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, it can exist in two chair conformations which are in equilibrium: a diequatorial conformer and a diaxial conformer.\n\n*   **Conformation A (diequatorial):** The bromine atom at C1 is in an equatorial position, and the methyl group at C2 is also in an equatorial position. This is the more stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position.\n*   **Conformation B (diaxial):** The bromine atom at C1 is in an axial position, and the methyl group at C2 is also in an axial position. This is the less stable conformation due to significant 1,3-diaxial steric strain.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Reactive Conformation**\nThe E2 reaction can only proceed from the conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial. Therefore, the reaction must occur via **Conformation B (diaxial)**, even though it is the less stable conformer and present in a very small concentration at equilibrium. The small amount of Conformation B that is formed will be consumed by the reaction, and according to Le Châtelier's principle, the equilibrium will shift to produce more of it to react.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Available Anti-Periplanar β-Hydrogens in the Reactive Conformation**\nIn Conformation B, the Br atom is axial. We need to find β-hydrogens that are also axial and point in the opposite direction. The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n\n*   **At C2:** This carbon has the axial methyl group. Its other substituent, the hydrogen atom, must therefore be in an **equatorial** position. This hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Thus, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is **not possible** via the E2 mechanism.\n*   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and the other is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen** at C6 is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) for E2 elimination with the axial bromine at C1.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Product**\nSince elimination can only occur by removing the axial hydrogen from C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 remains untouched.\n\n*   Starting material: 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n*   Elimination occurs between C1 and C6.\n*   Product: The resulting alkene is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n1.  **Reaction Type:** Recognize that strong, bulky base + secondary halide leads to an E2 reaction.\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The E2 reaction requires a *trans-diaxial* arrangement of the leaving group and a β-hydrogen.\n3.  **Conformational Analysis:** The *trans* starting material exists in a stable diequatorial form and an unstable diaxial form. The reaction *must* proceed through the unstable diaxial conformer because only it has an axial leaving group.\n4.  **Regiochemistry:** The choice of which β-hydrogen is removed is dictated not by which leads to the more stable alkene (Zaitsev's Rule), but by which one has the required anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) orientation. In this specific molecule, only the hydrogen on C6 can meet this requirement.\n5.  **Product Name:** The product formed has the methyl group at position 3 relative to the double bond.\n\nThe reaction exclusively forms the less substituted alkene (the \"Hofmann-like\" product) not because of the bulky base, but because of the strict stereoelectronic requirements of the E2 mechanism for this particular substrate.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
