    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a **single genus** of mushroom that is specifically known for producing a **distinctly blue spore print**. This is a question of mycological identification, where spore print color is a key characteristic.\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   A common first thought or quick search result points to the genus *Lactarius*, specifically the species *Lactarius indigo*. This mushroom is famous for its vibrant blue color and the blue \"milk\" (latex) it exudes when cut.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** It is a widespread myth that *Lactarius indigo* has a blue spore print. While the mushroom's flesh and latex are blue, its spore print is actually a creamy white to yellowish color. Therefore, *Lactarius* is not the correct answer, despite being a common guess.\n\n3.  **Exploring Other Blue Mushrooms:**\n    *   Other mushrooms can be blue, such as *Entoloma hochstetteri* (the New Zealand blue mushroom), but its spore print is pinkish-brown.\n    *   Many species in genera like *Boletus* or *Psilocybe* stain blue when bruised due to chemical reactions, but their spore prints are olive-brown and purple-brown to black, respectively.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The color of the mushroom's body (the basidiocarp) does not necessarily determine the color of its spores.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Genus:**\n    *   The claim of a \"blue spore print\" is extremely rare and debated in mycology. No mushroom produces a spore print that is bright, primary blue like ink.\n    *   However, there is one genus that contains species whose spore print is described by mycologists as being the closest to blue. This genus is **Entocybe**.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The genus *Entocybe* was scientifically established in 2011; before that, these species were classified within the much larger genus *Entoloma*. So, depending on the age of the source material, one might see *Entoloma* cited instead.\n\n5.  **Detailing the Correct Answer:**\n    *   Species within the genus *Entocybe*, such as *Entocybe nitida*, produce a spore deposit that is not a true, vibrant blue, but is described as being a unique **violaceous-gray** or **blue-gray**.\n    *   When viewed in a thick deposit (a spore mass), this color can appear distinctly bluish compared to the typical spore colors of white, brown, pink, or black.\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The term \"distinctly blue\" in the question should be interpreted as this unique blue-gray hue, as it is the only known instance of such a color in fungal spore prints. This makes *Entocybe* the only genus fitting the description.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a careful analysis that goes beyond common myths, the single genus known to contain species that produce the closest thing to a blue spore print (specifically, a blue-gray or violaceous-gray spore mass) is *Entocybe*.\n\n<<<Entocybe>>>"
