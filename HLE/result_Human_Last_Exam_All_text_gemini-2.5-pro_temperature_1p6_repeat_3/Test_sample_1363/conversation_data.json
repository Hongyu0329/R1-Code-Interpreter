    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** This is a standard figure in many ballroom dances where the couple rotates to the left (counter-clockwise). It typically involves three steps for the leader and three for the follower to complete a portion of the turn.\n*   **Overturning a Turn:** This means rotating more than the standard amount prescribed by the dance's syllabus or technical manual for that specific figure. For a typical Reverse Turn, the standard rotation is 3/4 of a full circle (270 degrees) over the three steps. Overturning would mean rotating, for example, 7/8 or a full 360 degrees.\n*   **\"Without Disregarding the Technique\":** This is the most crucial part of the question. It means performing the figure while adhering strictly to the fundamental principles that define that dance style. These principles include footwork (e.g., heel leads, toe leads), body action (e.g., CBM - Contra Body Movement), rise and fall, and sway. If you have to violate a core principle to achieve the overturn, then it's considered impossible *within the proper technique*.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Dance Style**\n\nLet's examine the Reverse Turn in each of the listed dances and see if it can be overturned while respecting the dance's core technique.\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The technique is based on continuous, flowing rotation. While a standard reverse turn covers 360 degrees over 6 steps, skilled dancers can and do slightly overturn their turns for floorcraft (navigating a crowded floor) without breaking the fundamental flow and character of the dance. It is not impossible.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz:** The English Waltz is a \"swing\" dance characterized by Rise and Fall, Sway, and CBM. These technical elements are what create the rotational power. By increasing the amount of swing and CBM, a dancer can generate more rotation. In fact, an \"Overturned Reverse Turn\" is a recognized variation in the Waltz syllabus. Therefore, overturning is possible and technically sanctioned.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** Tango technique is fundamentally different from the swing dances.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept on one level, often with flexed knees.\n    *   **No Sway:** The body does not incline sideways.\n    *   **Specific CBM application:** In the standard Reverse Turn (for the leader: Left Foot forward, Right Foot side & slightly back, Left Foot back), CBM is used on step 1, but critically, there is **no CBM on step 2**.\n    *   **Staccato Action & Footwork:** On step 2, the feet are brought together before step 3 is taken. There is no \"swinging\" of the leg or body through the position. The turn is generated by a sharp, controlled pivot and body rotation, not by momentum from swing.\n    *   **The Impossibility:** To achieve an overturn in Tango, a dancer would be forced to introduce a swinging action and CBM on step 2, which are the very techniques that define the other dances (Waltz, Foxtrot) but are explicitly forbidden in Tango technique for this figure. Doing so would be a clear disregard for the core principles that make Tango what it is. The sharp, clipped, non-swinging action fundamentally limits the amount of possible rotation.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, Foxtrot is a quintessential swing dance. Its technique of CBM, body swing, and continuous movement allows for figures to be easily modified. Overturning the Reverse Turn is common and achieved by enhancing the very swing action that is central to the dance's technique. It is not impossible.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is also a swing dance, characterized by speed, dynamic movement, and CBM. The principles are similar to Waltz and Foxtrot in how rotation is generated. Overturning figures is not only possible but frequently used in choreography to create speed and travel down the floor.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\n\nIn all the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep, and to an extent Viennese Waltz), the technique used to create a turn (swing, CBM, momentum) can be amplified to create *more* turn (an overturn). In European Tango, the technique for the Reverse Turn is fundamentally restrictive. It lacks the elements of swing and uses a specific foot and body action that limits the degree of rotation. To force more rotation would require abandoning these Tango-specific techniques and adopting the techniques of a swing dance, which is the definition of \"disregarding the technique.\"\n\nTherefore, European Tango is the only dance on the list where it is technically impossible to overturn a standard Reverse Turn without violating its fundamental technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
