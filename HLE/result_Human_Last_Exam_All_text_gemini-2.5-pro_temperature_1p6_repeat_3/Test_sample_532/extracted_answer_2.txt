A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if it is the direct product of a nilpotent group of odd order and a 2-group K, where K is one of the following:
(1) an abelian 2-group,
(2) a generalized quaternion group,
(3) a group of the form D_8 x (Z_2)^m for some integer m >= 0,
(4) a group of the form Q_8 x (Z_2)^m for some integer m >= 0.
