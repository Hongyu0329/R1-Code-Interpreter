    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues about this entity:\n    *   It's part of a quote from Paul Morand.\n    *   This quote was cited by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   The entity should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   The \"symbol of a nation\" is given as an example of this entity.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The key is to find the specific text where Fernand Braudel quotes Paul Morand. The quote appears in Braudel's essay \"History and the Social Sciences: The Longue Durée,\" which is part of his book *On History* (*Écrits sur l'histoire*). In this essay, Braudel critiques certain approaches to history and uses Morand's quote as an example of a limited, though intuitively appealing, perspective.\n\n3.  **Examine the Quote:** Braudel quotes a passage from Paul Morand's 1931 book, *Indian Air* (*Air Indien*). The crucial part of Morand's statement is as follows:\n    *\"**Civilisation** is a celestial globe. You have to look at it from all sides... One's own particular **civilisation** must first be inscribed in a sphere. Its symbol should not be the plane, but the sphere.\"*\n\n4.  **Identify the Entity:** The quote explicitly names the conceptual entity. Morand states directly, \"**Civilisation**... must first be inscribed in a sphere.\" This is the direct answer.\n\n5.  **Verify with the Clues:** Let's check if \"Civilisation\" fits all the conditions mentioned in the question.\n    *   **Quoted by Braudel from Morand?** Yes.\n    *   **Inscribed within a sphere?** Yes, the quote explicitly states this.\n    *   **Exemplified by the symbol of a nation?** Yes. Morand's phrase \"One's own particular civilisation\" clearly refers to the culture, history, and identity of a specific group, such as a nation. The idea is that a nation's civilisation should not be viewed in isolation (as a flat plane) but understood in its global context, as one point on a sphere among many others.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis of the direct quote from Paul Morand, as cited by Fernand Braudel, reveals that the conceptual entity which should be inscribed within a sphere is \"Civilisation.\"\n\n<<<Civilisation>>>"
