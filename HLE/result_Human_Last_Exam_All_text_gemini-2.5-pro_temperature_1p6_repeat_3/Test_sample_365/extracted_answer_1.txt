The product is an isomer of the starting material, formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. Its structure contains a rearranged tricyclic carbon skeleton. The original tertiary alcohol group at C2 is converted to a ketone. One new carbon-carbon double bond is formed between the original C1 and C6 atoms. The 7,7-dimethoxy ketal and the (tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy groups remain intact.
