    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the equations**\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for a fluid with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and pressure $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ are given by the system:\n1.  Momentum Equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  Incompressibility Condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, and we have set the constant density $\\rho=1$ and considered no external forces for the analysis of the intrinsic symmetries of the PDEs. The independent variables are time $t$ and spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$. The dependent variables are the velocity components $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure $p$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Symmetries via Physical Principles and Scaling**\n\nThe dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is the number of independent infinitesimal generators. We can identify these generators by considering transformations that leave the equations invariant.\n\n*   **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. This gives rise to a time translation symmetry: $t \\to t + c_0$. This corresponds to **1 generator** ($\\partial_t$).\n\n*   **Spatial Translations:** The equations' coefficients are constant and do not depend on the spatial coordinate $\\mathbf{x}$. This implies symmetry under spatial translations: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$. This corresponds to **3 generators** ($\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$).\n\n*   **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are written in a coordinate-free vector form, using operators like $\\nabla$ and $\\nabla^2$. This means they are invariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates, provided the vector quantities $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\nabla p$ are rotated as well: $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$ for $R \\in SO(3)$. The rotation group $SO(3)$ is 3-dimensional, which gives **3 generators** (e.g., $J_z = x_2 \\partial_{x_1} - x_1 \\partial_{x_2} + u_2 \\partial_{u_1} - u_1 \\partial_{u_2}$, and its cyclic permutations).\n\n*   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under Galilean boosts: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$. The pressure $p$ remains unchanged. This transformation corresponds to changing to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$. This gives **3 generators** (one for each component of $\\mathbf{v}_0$, e.g., $t\\partial_{x_1} + \\partial_{u_1}$).\n\nSo far, we have found $1+3+3+3=10$ generators, which form the Lie algebra of the Galilean group.\n\n*   **Scaling Symmetry:** We look for a scaling transformation of the form $t \\to \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^d p$. Substituting these into the Navier-Stokes equations and requiring the form of the equations to be preserved imposes constraints on the exponents $a, b, c, d$. The presence of the viscosity term $\\nu$ is crucial. The analysis yields a single independent parameter, leading to a one-parameter scaling group with $a=2, b=1, c=-1, d=-2$. This adds **1 more generator** to our list.\n    The generator is of the form $2t \\partial_t + \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} - \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} - 2p \\partial_p$.\n\n*   **Pressure Shift:** The pressure $p$ only appears through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, the equations are invariant under the transformation $p \\to p + C$, where $C$ is a constant, since $\\nabla(p+C) = \\nabla p$. This symmetry adds **1 generator**, which is $\\partial_p$.\n\nSumming up all the generators found gives a total dimension of $1+3+3+3+1+1 = 12$.\n\n**Step 3: Careful consideration of the Pressure Symmetry**\n\nA more detailed analysis shows that the equations are invariant not just under $p \\to p+C$, but under $p \\to p+f(t)$ where $f(t)$ is an arbitrary function of time, since $\\nabla f(t) = 0$. This implies that the full Lie algebra of point symmetries is actually infinite-dimensional.\n\nHowever, this infinite-dimensional part (a \"gauge freedom\" for pressure) is often treated separately for several reasons:\n1.  In physical problems, boundary conditions are often imposed (e.g., $p \\to 0$ as $|\\mathbf{x}| \\to \\infty$), which breaks this infinite symmetry, typically leaving only the constant shift symmetry $p \\to p+C$.\n2.  In the classification of symmetries, these \"trivial\" symmetries are sometimes factored out to study the structure of the remaining finite-dimensional part.\n3.  Standard literature and authoritative results on the symmetry group of Navier-Stokes (e.g., by Bytev, Olver) refer to a specific 12-dimensional Lie algebra as \"the\" symmetry algebra of the Navier-Stokes equations. This is the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry subalgebra of physical interest.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the standard analysis found in the literature, the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is understood to be the 12-dimensional group whose Lie algebra is spanned by the generators for:\n1.  Time translation (1 dimension)\n2.  Space translations (3 dimensions)\n3.  Space rotations (3 dimensions)\n4.  Galilean boosts (3 dimensions)\n5.  A single scaling transformation (1 dimension)\n6.  A constant shift in pressure (1 dimension)\n\nThe total dimension is $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
