    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Poem's Structure**\n'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi is a concise, metered poem designed for memorization. It systematically covers the essential articles of faith in Islam (Aqeedah). The topics are arranged in a logical order: belief in Allah and His attributes, belief in His Messengers, His Books, the Angels, the Last Day, and Destiny. The section on the Prophets is a distinct part of this structure.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Section on the Prophets**\nThe poem first discusses the attributes of Allah. It then transitions to the topic of the Prophets (Messengers). There is an introductory verse that states the obligation of knowing the names of twenty-five specific prophets. This verse sets the stage but does not yet list the names. In most standard editions of the poem, this is **Bayt 28**:\n\n> تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n> كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n> *The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding,*\n> *Upon every responsible person, so verify and benefit.*\n\nThis verse is the prelude to the list, not the beginning of the list itself.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Starting Verse of the List**\nThe verse immediately following the introduction begins the enumeration of the prophets' names. This is the true starting point of the list. This verse is **Bayt 29**:\n\n> هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ\n> صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُّتَّبَعْ\n> *They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with,*\n> *Salih, and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.*\n\nHere, the first six names are explicitly mentioned, confirming that Bayt 29 is the beginning of the list.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the List Through Subsequent Verses**\nThe poem continues to list the names in the verses that follow, woven into the poetic meter. We need to follow this sequence until the list of names concludes.\n\n*   **Bayt 30:** Continues with Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, and Ya'qub.\n*   **Bayt 31:** Continues with Shu'ayb, Yusuf, and Musa (referred to by his title 'al-Kalim' - the one who spoke to Allah).\n*   **Bayt 32:** Continues with Harun, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Final Verse Containing Names**\nThe list culminates in the final verse that mentions the remaining names, including a title for the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) which concludes the list. This is **Bayt 33**:\n\n> إِلْيَاسُ الْيَسَعْ يُوْنُسْ زَكَرِيَّا\n> يَحْيَى عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيًّا\n> *Ilyas, al-Yasa', Yunus, Zakariyya,*\n> *Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a title for Prophet Muhammad), the Seal; leave deviation.*\n\nThis verse mentions the final prophets in the list and refers to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) as 'Taha' and the 'Seal' (Khatim), effectively ending the enumeration.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the Verse After the List**\nThe verse that follows, **Bayt 34**, does not mention any new names. Instead, it offers a prayer of peace and blessings upon all the prophets who were just listed:\n\n> عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ\n> وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n> *Upon them be prayers and peace,*\n> *And upon their families, as long as the days last.*\n\nSince this verse refers back to the names without listing any, the actual list concludes in the prior verse (Bayt 33).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Start vs. Introduction:** It's important to distinguish between the introductory verse that mentions the *number* of prophets (Bayt 28) and the first verse that begins *listing the names* (Bayt 29). The question asks for where the names are mentioned.\n2.  **End vs. Conclusion:** The list of names ends in Bayt 33. The subsequent verse (Bayt 34) is a concluding prayer for those mentioned and marks the end of the section, but not the end of the list itself.\n3.  **Numbering Variations:** While the numbering from 29 to 33 is standard in most editions, minor variations can exist if the opening Basmalah and praise are counted differently. However, the block of five consecutive verses containing the names remains consistent.\n4.  **Incomplete List:** The poem doesn't explicitly name all 25 prophets required to be known. It lists a selection by name and uses titles for others, as it is a short poem meant for memorization, not an exhaustive theological treatise. The intention is to affirm the belief in all of them as introduced in Bayt 28.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe enumeration of the prophets' names begins at **Bayt 29** and concludes at **Bayt 33**. Therefore, the names are mentioned from Bayt 29 to Bayt 33 inclusive.\n\n<<<From Bayt 29 to Bayt 33>>>"
