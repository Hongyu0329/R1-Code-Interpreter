Yes, the theory can fail. This happens if the added birefringent medium exhibits polarization-dependent loss (dichroism). A key example is a polarizer. A polarizer's operation is not mathematically invertible because it permanently projects the input light onto a specific polarization state, irretrievably losing the information contained in the orthogonal polarization component. This loss of information makes it impossible to uniquely determine the necessary input field from the output field, thus breaking the theory.
