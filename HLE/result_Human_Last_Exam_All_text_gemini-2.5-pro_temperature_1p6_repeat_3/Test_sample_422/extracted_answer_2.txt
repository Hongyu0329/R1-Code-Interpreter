The two problems that the JTB theory runs into are:

1.  **Circularity of Definition:** The justification required for knowledge must itself be based on other epistemic states. Given that the only available states are "Belief" and "Knowledge," a strong justification would have to be based on pre-existing "Knowledge," making the definition of knowledge circular (i.e., you need to know things to know things).
2.  **Elimination of the "Justified Belief" Category:** The JTB model requires the existence of "justified belief" as a distinct conceptual state (which can be either true or false). The constraint that only "Knowledge" and "Belief" exist as states eliminates this essential intermediate category. This makes it impossible for "justification" to function as the ingredient that elevates a true belief to knowledge, as the category of beliefs that *are* justified (but may not be knowledge) cannot exist.
