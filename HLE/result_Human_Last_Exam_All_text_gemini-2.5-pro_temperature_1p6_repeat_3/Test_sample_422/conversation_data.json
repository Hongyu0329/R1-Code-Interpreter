    "This question asks us to identify two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge under the specific constraint that the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief. We must ignore Gettier-style problems.\n\n### **Analysis of Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Understand the JTB Definition:** Knowledge is defined as having three necessary and jointly sufficient conditions: the proposition is true (T), the subject believes the proposition (B), and the subject's belief is justified (J). K = JTB.\n2.  **Understand the Core Constraint:** The problem creates a simplified world of epistemic states. A person's attitude towards a proposition can *only* be \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\". There are no other states like \"doubt,\" \"suspension of judgment,\" or, crucially, \"justified belief\" as a distinct intermediate category.\n3.  **Identify the Source of Conflict:** The conflict arises from the \"J\" (Justification) component of the JTB theory. We need to analyze how \"justification\" can function in a system that only recognizes \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" as its possible states.\n4.  **Ignore Gettier Problems:** This means we should not focus on cases where a justified true belief falls short of knowledge due to luck. The problems we identify must be more fundamental to the structure of the JTB theory under the given constraints.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Problems**\n\n**Problem 1: The Problem of Circularity (The Regress of Justification)**\n\n1.  According to JTB, to know a proposition `P`, your belief in `P` must be justified.\n2.  What provides this justification? Typically, justification comes from other supporting beliefs. Let's say your belief in `P` is justified by your belief in `Q`.\n3.  For this justification to be strong enough to turn a true belief into knowledge, the justifying belief (`Q`) cannot be a mere arbitrary belief. It must also have a strong epistemic standing.\n4.  Under the constraint that our only epistemic states are \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge\", the only epistemic standing stronger than \"Belief\" is \"Knowledge\".\n5.  Therefore, for `Q` to adequately justify `P`, you must *know* `Q`.\n6.  This leads to a circular definition of knowledge. The JTB definition becomes: \"To **know** `P`, you must have a justified true belief in `P`, where the justification relies on you already **knowing** another proposition `Q`.\" Knowledge is thus defined in terms of itself, creating a vicious circle or an infinite regress (to know `Q` you must know `R`, and so on).\n\n**Problem 2: The Problem of the Missing State (\"Justified Belief\")**\n\n1.  The JTB model relies on the concept of a \"justified belief\" as a crucial building block. A belief can be justified even if it turns out to be false (e.g., believing the time based on a clock that stopped a minute ago). This state, \"justified belief,\" is distinct from both \"mere belief\" and \"knowledge.\"\n2.  The progression in the JTB model is conceptually:\n    Belief -> Add Justification -> Justified Belief -> Add Truth -> Knowledge\n3.  The problem states that the only available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This eliminates the necessary intermediate category of \"justified belief\".\n4.  Consider a justified but false belief. Since it is false, it cannot be \"Knowledge\". According to the constraint, it must therefore be categorized as simple \"Belief\".\n5.  This is a critical flaw. If a justified false belief is indistinguishable from an unjustified belief (both are just \"Beliefs\"), then the concept of \"justification\" loses its meaning as a property that can be added to a belief independently of its truth. The JTB model breaks down because it cannot account for its own central component—justification—as a distinct property or state of a belief short of full knowledge. The model requires a category that the problem's constraints explicitly forbid.\n\n***\n\n**The two problems that the JTB theory runs into are:**\n\n1.  **Circularity of Definition:** The justification required for knowledge must itself be based on other epistemic states. Given that the only available states are \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge,\" a strong justification would have to be based on pre-existing \"Knowledge,\" making the definition of knowledge circular (i.e., you need to know things to know things).\n2.  **Elimination of the \"Justified Belief\" Category:** The JTB model requires the existence of \"justified belief\" as a distinct conceptual state (which can be either true or false). The constraint that only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" exist as states eliminates this essential intermediate category. This makes it impossible for \"justification\" to function as the ingredient that elevates a true belief to knowledge, as the category of beliefs that *are* justified (but may not be knowledge) cannot exist."
