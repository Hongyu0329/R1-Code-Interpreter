    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the polynomial\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nThis polynomial is of a specific form. Let's analyze its structure. It consists of a main part $g(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$ and a constant term $+22$.\n\nThe polynomial part $g(x)$ is related to a class of polynomials known as De Moivre polynomials or Dickson polynomials. Let's define the polynomial $D_n(x, a)$ by the recurrence relation:\n$D_0(x, a) = 2$\n$D_1(x, a) = x$\n$D_{n}(x, a) = x D_{n-1}(x, a) - a D_{n-2}(x, a)$\n\nThis definition is related to the identity for powers of a sum. If we let $x = y + a/y$, then $D_n(x, a) = y^n + (a/y)^n$.\nLet's compute $D_7(x, a)$:\n$D_2(x, a) = x^2 - 2a$\n$D_3(x, a) = x^3 - 3ax$\n$D_4(x, a) = x^4 - 4ax^2 + 2a^2$\n$D_5(x, a) = x^5 - 5ax^3 + 5a^2x$\n$D_6(x, a) = x^6 - 6ax^4 + 9a^2x^2 - 2a^3$\n$D_7(x, a) = x D_6 - a D_5 = x(x^6 - 6ax^4 + 9a^2x^2 - 2a^3) - a(x^5 - 5ax^3+5a^2x)$\n$D_7(x, a) = x^7 - 7ax^5 + 14a^2x^3 - 7a^3x$\n\nComparing $g(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$ with $D_7(x, a)$, we can set the coefficients equal:\n$-7a = -14 \\implies a = 2$.\n$14a^2 = 14(2^2) = 14 \\times 4 = 56$. This matches.\n$-7a^3 = -7(2^3) = -7 \\times 8 = -56$. This also matches.\nSo, the polynomial is $f(x) = D_7(x, 2) + 22$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Galois group of f(x) over Q\nThe natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is given by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. The density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ that are $n$-cycles, where $n = \\deg(f) = 7$.\nSo, we need to find the Galois group $G$ and count the number of 7-cycles in it.\n\n1.  **Irreducibility of f(x):** For polynomials of the form $D_n(x, a) - c$, there are known criteria for irreducibility. According to results by Turnwald, based on work by Fried, $D_n(x, a) - c$ for $n$ odd prime is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ only in specific cases. For our parameters ($n=7$, $a=2$, $c=-22$), none of these reducibility conditions are met. Thus, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Structure of the Galois group:** Since $f(x)$ is irreducible and of prime degree 7, its Galois group $G$ must be a transitive subgroup of $S_7$. A theorem by Brandl states that the Galois group of $D_n(x, a) - c$ (where $n$ is an odd prime and $a$ is not a rational square) is the dihedral group $D_n$, unless a specific condition is met. Here, $n=7$ and $a=2$, which is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The condition is that $\\sqrt{c^2 - 4a^n}$ belongs to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{(-1)^{(n-1)/2}n})$.\n    Let's check this condition:\n    *   $n=7, a=2, c=-22$.\n    *   $(-1)^{(n-1)/2}n = (-1)^3 \\cdot 7 = -7$. The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\n    *   $c^2 - 4a^n = (-22)^2 - 4(2^7) = 484 - 4(128) = 484 - 512 = -28$.\n    *   $\\sqrt{c^2-4a^n} = \\sqrt{-28} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot -7} = 2\\sqrt{-7}$.\n    *   The element $2\\sqrt{-7}$ is indeed in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\n    So the exceptional case of the theorem applies. This means the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_7$.\n3.  **Identifying the specific subgroup:** We know the following about $G$:\n    *   It is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$.\n    *   It is a subgroup of $D_7$.\n    *   The degree of $f(x)$ is a prime number, 7.\n    The transitive subgroups of $D_p$ for a prime $p$ are the cyclic group $C_p$ and the dihedral group $D_p$ itself. So, $G$ must be either $C_7$ or $D_7$.\n4.  **Distinguishing between C_7 and D_7:** If $G=C_7$, every non-identity element is a 7-cycle. By the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this would mean that $f(x)$ is reducible modulo only a finite set of primes (those ramifying in the splitting field). However, we can test the reducibility of $f(x)$ modulo small primes.\n    *   Modulo 3: $f(x) \\equiv x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 \\equiv x - 2x^5 + 2x^3 - 2x + 1 \\pmod 3$.\n        Since $x^3 \\equiv x \\pmod 3$, we have $x^5 \\equiv x^3 \\equiv x$ and $x^7 \\equiv x$.\n        $f(x) \\equiv x - 2x + 2x - 2x + 1 = -x+1 \\pmod 3$.\n        $f(x)$ has a root at $x=1 \\pmod 3$.\n    *   Modulo 5: $f(x) \\equiv x^7 - 4x^5 + x^3 - x + 2 \\pmod 5$.\n        Since $x^5 \\equiv x \\pmod 5$, we have $x^7 \\equiv x^3$.\n        $f(x) \\equiv x^3 - 4x + x^3 - x + 2 = 2x^3 - 5x + 2 \\equiv 2x^3+2 = 2(x^3+1) \\pmod 5$.\n        $f(x) \\equiv 2(x+1)(x^2-x+1) \\pmod 5$.\n        This is reducible modulo 5.\n    The existence of primes $p$ where $f(x)$ is reducible means the Galois group $G$ must contain elements that are not 7-cycles (specifically, elements with fixed points). This rules out $C_7$.\n    Therefore, the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must be $D_7$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the density\nThe natural density of primes $p$ where $f(x)$ remains irreducible is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in $G=D_7$ to the order of the group $|G|$.\n\n*   The dihedral group $D_7$ is the group of symmetries of a regular heptagon. Its order is $|D_7| = 2 \\times 7 = 14$.\n*   The elements of $D_7$ consist of:\n    *   The identity element.\n    *   6 rotations of the heptagon. In their permutation representation on the 7 vertices, these are all 7-cycles.\n    *   7 reflections. In their permutation representation, each reflection fixes one vertex and swaps the remaining 6 vertices in 3 pairs of 2. Their cycle structure is $(1)(2)(2)(2)$.\n*   An element of the Galois group corresponds to an irreducible polynomial modulo $p$ if and only if it acts as a single cycle on the set of all roots. In our case, this means it must be a 7-cycle.\n*   The number of 7-cycles in $D_7$ is 6.\n*   The total number of elements in $D_7$ is 14.\n\nThe density is the ratio:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $D_7$) / (Order of $D_7$) = 6 / 14 = 3/7."
