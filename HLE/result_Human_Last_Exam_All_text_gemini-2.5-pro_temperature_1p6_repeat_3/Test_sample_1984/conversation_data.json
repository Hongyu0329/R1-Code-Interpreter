    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a first-order autonomous differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nWe need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we need to calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are the constant solutions to the differential equation. They occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\n\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor zero:\n*   $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n*   $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stability of the Equilibrium Points**\nTo determine the stability of each equilibrium point, we analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the intervals around these points. This is known as a phase line analysis.\n\n*   **Case 1: $x < 0$**\n    Let's pick a test value, for example, $x = -1$.\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 1(-2)^2 = 4$.\n    Since $f(x) > 0$, the function $x(t)$ is increasing in this region. This means that trajectories starting to the left of $x=0$ will move towards $x=0$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $0 < x < 1$**\n    Let's pick a test value, for example, $x = 0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -(0.5)(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, the function $x(t)$ is decreasing in this region. This means that trajectories starting between $0$ and $1$ will move away from $x=1$ and towards $x=0$.\n\n*   **Case 3: $x > 1$**\n    Let's pick a test value, for example, $x = 2$.\n    $f(2) = -(2)(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, the function $x(t)$ is decreasing in this region. This means that trajectories starting to the right of $x=1$ will move towards $x=1$.\n\n**Summary of Stability:**\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x=0$**: Trajectories from its left ($x<0$) move towards it (since $f(x)>0$), and trajectories from its right ($0<x<1$) also move towards it (since $f(x)<0$). Therefore, $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point (a sink).\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x=1$**: Trajectories from its left ($0<x<1$) move away from it (since $f(x)<0$), while trajectories from its right ($x>1$) move towards it (since $f(x)<0$). An equilibrium point is only considered stable if nearby trajectories on *both* sides approach it. Since trajectories from the left move away, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as **semi-stable**.\n\n**Careful point:** The definition of a stable equilibrium requires that solutions starting in a neighborhood of the point remain in that neighborhood for all future time. For $x=1$, solutions starting at $1-\\epsilon$ (for any small $\\epsilon>0$) will move away towards 0. Thus, $x=1$ is not stable.\n\n**4. Determine the value of m**\nThe number of stable equilibrium points is $m$. From our analysis, only $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\nTherefore, $m = 1$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\nWe need to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\nThis is the final result.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
