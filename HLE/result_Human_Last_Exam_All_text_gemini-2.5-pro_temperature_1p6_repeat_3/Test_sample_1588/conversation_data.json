    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n    The BCH formula expresses `Z` in `e^Z = e^X e^Y` as a series of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`:\n    `Z = X + Y + Z_2(X, Y) + Z_3(X, Y) + ... + Z_n(X, Y) + ...`\n    where `Z_n(X, Y)` is the term of order `n`. This term is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree `n`, meaning it is a linear combination of all possible nested commutators containing a total of `n` instances of `X` and `Y`.\n\n2.  **Relating BCH Terms to Free Lie Algebras**\n    The term `Z_n(X, Y)` belongs to a specific vector space: the `n`-th graded component of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements (`X` and `Y`). Let's call this space `L_n(X, Y)`. Any element in this space can be written as a linear combination of a set of basis vectors. For example, a basis can be constructed using Hall commutators or Lyndon words.\n\n3.  **Interpreting \"Number of Nonzero Coefficients\"**\n    The question \"What is the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10?\" asks for the number of distinct, linearly independent commutator terms that appear with a non-zero numerical coefficient in the expression for `Z_{10}(X, Y)`.\n    It is a fundamental result in the theory of Lie algebras that when `Z_n` is expanded in a standard basis (like a Hall or Lyndon basis), all basis elements of `L_n(X, Y)` appear with a non-zero coefficient. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the dimension of the vector space `L_{10}(X, Y)`.\n\n4.  **Using Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n    The dimension of the `n`-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on `k` generators is given by Witt's formula:\n    `dim(L_n(k)) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the order (degree).\n    *   `k` is the number of generators.\n    *   The sum `Σ_{d|n}` is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n5.  **Applying Witt's Formula to Our Problem**\n    For our specific question:\n    *   The order is `n = 10`.\n    *   The generators are `X` and `Y`, so `k = 2`.\n\n    The formula becomes: `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * Σ_{d|10} μ(d) * 2^(10/d)`\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n*   **Step A: Find the divisors of n = 10.**\n    The positive integers `d` that divide 10 are: `1, 2, 5, 10`.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor.**\n    The Möbius function is defined as:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(d) = (-1)^m` if `d` is a product of `m` distinct prime numbers.\n    *   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n    For our divisors:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2 * 5) = (-1)^2 = 1` (10 is the product of 2 distinct primes)\n\n*   **Step C: Substitute these values into Witt's formula.**\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [μ(1)*2^(10/1) + μ(2)*2^(10/2) + μ(5)*2^(10/5) + μ(10)*2^(10/10)]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [1 * 2^10 + (-1) * 2^5 + (-1) * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1]`\n\n*   **Step D: Perform the arithmetic.**\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [1 * 1024 - 1 * 32 - 1 * 4 + 1 * 2]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [1026 - 36]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = (1/10) * [990]`\n    `dim(L_{10}(2)) = 99`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of linearly independent commutators of order 10 is 99. Since all of these appear with a non-zero coefficient in the BCH expansion, the number of non-zero coefficients is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
