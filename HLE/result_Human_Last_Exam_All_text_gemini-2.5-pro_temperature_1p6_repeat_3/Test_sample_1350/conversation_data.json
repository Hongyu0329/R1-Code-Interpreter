    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Text:** William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n    *   **Character:** Who is the specific person?\n    *   **Action:** This character must have visited a \"Roman city.\"\n    *   **Description:** This character must describe Roman \"religious practices.\"\n    *   **Specific Reference:** The description must be clearly recognizable as the myth of \"Romulus and Remus.\"\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:** The main characters of the novel include Thiodolf (the war-leader of the Wolfings), Hall-Sun (his daughter), the Wood-Sun (his lover and a supernatural being), and other members of the Gothic tribe like Otter. We must determine which of these characters would have had the opportunity to visit a Roman city.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Character Backstories:** The narrative establishes that the protagonist, **Thiodolf**, has a unique past that separates him from the other Wolfings. In his youth, before the events of the novel, he served as a soldier in the Roman legions. This experience makes him the only character with firsthand, in-depth knowledge of Roman civilization, including their cities and customs. The other Goths only know the Romans as an invading enemy.\n\n4.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:** The scene where this description occurs is early in the book, in **Chapter IV, \"The Earl speaketh with the Folk-mote.\"** Thiodolf is addressing the assembly of the Wolfings to prepare them for the war against the Romans. To explain the nature of their enemy, he draws upon his own past experiences living among them.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Description of Religious Practices:** In his speech, Thiodolf recounts visiting a great Roman city. He describes entering a temple (\"God-house\") and seeing a prominent statue. His description is as follows:\n    *   He saw an image made of brass (bronze).\n    *   The image was of a **she-wolf**.\n    *   The she-wolf was **giving suck to two naked male infants**.\n    *   He states that the Romans worship this image, call the wolf their \"mother\" and their \"goddess,\" and consider themselves the \"sons of the Wolf.\"\n\n6.  **Connect the Description to Romulus and Remus:** This description is an unmistakable allusion to the Roman foundation myth. The twin boys, Romulus and Remus, were famously abandoned as infants and suckled by a she-wolf (Lupa) before growing up to found the city of Rome. The bronze statue of the Capitoline Wolf suckling the twins is one of the most enduring symbols of Rome. Therefore, Thiodolf's account directly matches the criteria in the question.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Character's Unique Position:** Thiodolf's role as a bridge between the Gothic and Roman worlds is crucial. His past service in the Roman army is what allows him to provide this specific, detailed intelligence to his people and to the reader.\n*   **Thematic Irony:** A key point Morris makes through this description is the irony that the Romans, who revere a wolf as their mythic ancestor, are now coming to destroy the \"Wolfings,\" a tribe that identifies itself with the wolf. Thiodolf himself points out this strange parallel.\n*   **Source of the Information:** The information comes directly from Thiodolf's speech to his people, not from a narrator's exposition or another character's report. He is the direct witness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the character who fulfills all the conditions of the question. The character who served in the Roman army, visited a Roman city, and described seeing the statue of the she-wolf and the twins is Thiodolf.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
