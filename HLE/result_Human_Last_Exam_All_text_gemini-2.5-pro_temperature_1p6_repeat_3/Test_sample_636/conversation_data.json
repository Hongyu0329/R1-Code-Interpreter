    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear time-invariant system such that the closed-loop system `A + BF` has specific eigenvalues.\n\n**1. Identify System Matrices and Goal:**\n*   The state matrix is `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n*   The input matrix is `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`.\n*   We need to find a 2x2 feedback gain matrix `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n*   The desired eigenvalues for the closed-loop system `A_cl = A + BF` are `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:**\n*   A system with eigenvalues `λ1` and `λ2` has a characteristic polynomial `p(s) = (s - λ1)(s - λ2)`.\n*   Given `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`, the desired polynomial is:\n    `p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n    `p(s) = (s + 1 - j)(s + 1 + j)`\n    `p(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\n    `p(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n    `p(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**3. Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl`:**\n*   First, calculate the product `BF`:\n    `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n*   Next, calculate the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n    `A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n    `A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**4. Determine the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`:**\n*   The characteristic polynomial for a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `s^2 - trace(M)s + det(M)`.\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)f2 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n\n**5. Equate Coefficients:**\n*   By comparing the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` with the desired polynomial `s^2 + 2s + 2`, we can equate the coefficients:\n    *   `-trace(A_cl) = 2`  => `trace(A_cl) = -2`\n    *   `det(A_cl) = 2`\n*   This gives us a system of two equations:\n    1.  `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1 = -2`  => `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1`\n    2.  `(-1 + f1 + 2*f3)f2 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1) = 2`\n\n**6. Solve for the Elements of F:**\n*   **Careful Point:** We have two equations and four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means the system is underdetermined, and there are infinite possible solutions for `F`. We only need to find one valid solution.\n*   A common simplification is to assume that one of the control inputs is not used, which can be achieved by setting the corresponding row in `F` to zero. Let's set the second row of `F` to zero, so `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n*   With this assumption, the equations simplify:\n    1.  `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1` => `f1 + f2 = -1`\n    2.  The closed-loop matrix becomes `A_cl = [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]]`.\n        *   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1) + f2 = f1 + f2 - 1`. From `trace(A_cl) = -2`, we get `f1 + f2 - 1 = -2` => `f1 + f2 = -1`. (This is the same as the first equation).\n        *   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1)f2 - (1 + f2)(1 + f1) = -f2 + f1*f2 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2) = -f1 - 2*f2 - 1`. From `det(A_cl) = 2`, we get `-f1 - 2*f2 - 1 = 2` => `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`.\n*   Now we have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n    a) `f1 + f2 = -1`\n    b) `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n*   Add equation (a) and (b):\n    `(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n    `-f2 = 2`\n    `f2 = -2`\n*   Substitute `f2 = -2` into equation (a):\n    `f1 + (-2) = -1`\n    `f1 = 1`\n*   So, a valid solution is `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**7. Final Answer Formulation:**\n*   The state feedback gain matrix is `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`.\n\n**8. Verification (Optional but Recommended):**\n*   Let's check if this `F` gives the correct eigenvalues.\n    `A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n    `A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n    `A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\n*   The characteristic polynomial is `det(sI - A_cl)`:\n    `det([[s, 1], [-2, s+2]]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n*   The roots of `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0` are `s = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = (-2 ± 2j)/2 = -1 ± j`.\n*   The verification is successful.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
