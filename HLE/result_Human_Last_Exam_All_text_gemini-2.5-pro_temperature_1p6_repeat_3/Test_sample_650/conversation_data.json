    "An step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time complexity is as follows:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal of the Algorithm**\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` converts a non-negative integer `n` into its base-`c` representation. For example, `IMAG(13, 2)` would produce `(1101)_2` because `13 = 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0`. The algorithm essentially repeatedly calculates the remainder (`a_i`) and the quotient (`q`) of dividing the number by the base `c`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Computational Steps**\nThe algorithm consists of three main parts:\n*   **Step 1: Initialization.** This step is executed only once.\n*   **Step 2: The `while` loop.** This is the core of the algorithm, and its running time will depend on the number of times it iterates.\n*   **Step 3: Return.** This takes constant time.\n\n**3. Analyze the Initialization Step (Step 1)**\n*   `i := 0`: One assignment operation.\n*   `x := n`: One assignment operation.\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One division and one assignment.\n*   `a_0 := x - qc`: One multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment.\nAll these are basic arithmetic and assignment operations. Assuming a standard computational model where these operations take constant time, the initialization step has a constant time complexity, which we can denote as `O(1)`.\n\n**4. Analyze the `while` Loop (Step 2)**\nThe complexity of the algorithm is dominated by this loop. We need to determine two things:\na.  The number of operations inside the loop (cost per iteration).\nb.  The number of times the loop executes (number of iterations).\n\n*   **Cost per iteration:**\n    *   `i := i + 1`: One addition, one assignment.\n    *   `x := q`: One assignment.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One division, one assignment.\n    *   `a_i := x - qc`: One multiplication, one subtraction, one assignment.\n    Like the initialization, the body of the loop consists of a fixed number of basic operations. Therefore, the cost of a single iteration is constant, `O(1)`.\n\n*   **Number of iterations:**\n    The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace how the value of `q` changes.\n    *   Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   After the 1st iteration, the new `q` is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is equal to `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   After the 2nd iteration, the new `q` is `⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋`, which is equal to `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    The loop terminates when this value of `q` becomes 0.\n    `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`\n    This condition is met when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    To find the number of iterations `k`, we can take the logarithm base `c` of both sides:\n    `log_c(n) < k + 1`\n    `k > log_c(n) - 1`\n    This means the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Specifically, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` (for `n ≥ c`). For example, converting 100 to base 2 requires `⌊log_2(100)⌋ = ⌊6.64...⌋ = 6` loop iterations. The number of digits in the base-c representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The algorithm performs one main calculation for each digit.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Time Complexity**\nThe total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the costs of initialization and all loop iterations.\n`T(n) = (Cost of Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) * (Cost per Iteration)`\n`T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) * O(1)`\n`T(n) = O(log_c(n))`\n\n**6. Final Simplification (Careful Point)**\nIn Big O notation, the base of the logarithm does not matter because logarithms of different bases are related by a constant factor. The change of base formula is `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Constant factors are ignored in Big O notation. Therefore, we can express the complexity in terms of the natural logarithm (`ln`) or the common logarithm (`log`), which is standard practice.\n`O(log_c(n)) = O(log n)`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of divisions and multiplications the algorithm performs is proportional to the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`, which is `O(log n)`. Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is logarithmic.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
