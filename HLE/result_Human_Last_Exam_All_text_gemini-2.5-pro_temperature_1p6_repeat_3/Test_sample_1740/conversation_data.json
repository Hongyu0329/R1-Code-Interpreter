    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 Family\" and \"Member\"**\nThe \"let-7 family\" is a group of miRNAs that share a similar sequence, particularly in the \"seed region,\" which is critical for target gene recognition. They are highly conserved across species and are known as key regulators of development and as tumor suppressors.\nA \"member\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n1.  **Mature miRNA:** The final, functional small RNA molecule. Several genes can produce the exact same mature miRNA.\n2.  **Precursor miRNA gene (locus):** The specific gene in the human genome that codes for a let-7 miRNA. Some mature miRNAs are encoded by multiple distinct genes (paralogs).\n\nTo be thorough, we should consider both interpretations. The phrase \"how many members... have been identified\" most precisely refers to the number of distinct genetic loci that have been discovered and annotated in the human genome.\n\n**Step 3: Consult Authoritative Sources**\nThe primary and most reliable database for miRNA sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. We will use the information from miRBase (the current release) to identify all human let-7 genes. The prefix for human miRNAs is \"hsa\".\n\n**Step 4: List the Identified Human let-7 Precursor Genes**\nBased on the current annotation in miRBase, the following precursor miRNA genes belong to the let-7 family in humans (*Homo sapiens*):\n\n*   **let-7a** is encoded by three distinct genes:\n    1.  `hsa-let-7a-1`\n    2.  `hsa-let-7a-2`\n    3.  `hsa-let-7a-3`\n*   **let-7b** is encoded by one gene:\n    4.  `hsa-let-7b`\n*   **let-7c** is encoded by one gene:\n    5.  `hsa-let-7c`\n*   **let-7d** is encoded by one gene:\n    6.  `hsa-let-7d`\n*   **let-7e** is encoded by one gene:\n    7.  `hsa-let-7e`\n*   **let-7f** is encoded by two distinct genes:\n    8.  `hsa-let-7f-1`\n    9.  `hsa-let-7f-2`\n*   **let-7g** is encoded by one gene:\n    10. `hsa-let-7g`\n*   **let-7i** is encoded by one gene:\n    11. `hsa-let-7i`\n*   **miR-98** is also considered a member of the let-7 family due to its sequence similarity and shared function. It is encoded by one gene:\n    12. `hsa-mir-98`\n\n**Step 5: Count the Identified Genes**\nBy summing up the list from Step 4, we get a total of 12 distinct precursor genes.\n3 (for let-7a) + 1 (for let-7b) + 1 (for let-7c) + 1 (for let-7d) + 1 (for let-7e) + 2 (for let-7f) + 1 (for let-7g) + 1 (for let-7i) + 1 (for mir-98) = **12 genes**.\n\n**Step 6: Count the Distinct Mature miRNAs (A Careful Point)**\nWhile there are 12 genes, they produce mature miRNAs that fall into **9** distinct sequence types. The three `let-7a` genes all produce the same mature `let-7a` miRNA, and the two `let-7f` genes produce the same mature `let-7f` miRNA. Therefore, the list of distinct mature let-7 family members is:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe question \"how many members... have been identified\" is best answered by the number of distinct genes (or loci) discovered in the human genome. This number is 12. These 12 genes give rise to 9 unique mature miRNA molecules.\n\n<<<12>>>"
