    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Terms in the Question:**\n    *   **Tonic Chord (I or i):** This is the foundational or \"home\" chord of a song's key. For a song in A minor, the tonic chord is A minor. For a song in C major, the tonic is C major.\n    *   **Fifth Chord (V or v):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This specifies that the chord on the fifth degree must be a *minor* chord.\n        *   In a major key (e.g., C major: C-D-E-F-G-A-B), the standard fifth chord is major (G Major: G-B-D). A *minor* fifth chord would be G minor (G-Bb-D), which uses a note from outside the standard major scale.\n        *   In a natural minor key (e.g., A minor: A-B-C-D-E-F-G), the fifth chord is naturally minor (E minor: E-G-B). This is a very common chord in minor key songs.\n    *   **Chord Jump:** This implies an immediate and distinct change from one chord to the next, particularly at the song's beginning.\n\n2.  **Translate the Question:** We are looking for a Beatles song that begins with the chord progression i → v (tonic minor to minor fifth) or I → v (tonic major to minor fifth). The i → v progression is more common in pop and folk music.\n\n3.  **Search for and Analyze Potential Songs:**\n    *   **Candidate 1: \"Michelle\"**\n        *   The verses are in the key of F minor. The tonic chord (i) is F minor (Fm).\n        *   The fifth degree of F is C. The minor fifth chord (v) would be C minor (Cm).\n        *   However, upon listening to the opening, the first major chord change after the introductory F minor is to B-flat minor (Bbm), which is the subdominant (iv) chord, not the minor fifth. Therefore, \"Michelle\" is not the correct answer.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: \"Things We Said Today\"**\n        *   This song is in the key of A minor.\n        *   The tonic chord (i) is A minor (Am).\n        *   The fifth degree of the A minor scale is E. The naturally occurring chord on this degree is E minor (Em), which is the minor fifth (v) chord.\n        *   The song starts immediately with the verse, sung by Paul McCartney.\n        *   The very first line is played over the chords A minor to E minor: \"(Am)You say you will (Em)love me...\"\n        *   This is a direct and clear jump from the tonic (Am) to the minor fifth (Em) right at the start of the song.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The distinction between a major fifth (V) and a minor fifth (v) is crucial. A song like \"Hey Jude\" starts I → V (F major to C major), which would not be correct.\n*   The term \"starts with\" implies the very beginning of the song, not a progression that appears later in the verse or chorus.\n*   One must accurately identify the key of the song to correctly label the tonic and fifth chords. For \"Things We Said Today,\" the verse is unambiguously in A minor.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, \"Things We Said Today\" is a perfect example of a Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord (Am → Em, or i → v).\n\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
