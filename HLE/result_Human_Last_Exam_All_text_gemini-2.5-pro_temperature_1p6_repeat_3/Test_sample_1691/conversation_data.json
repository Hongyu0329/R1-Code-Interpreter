    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integral and the Integrand**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet the polynomial in the denominator be $P(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. The integrand is $f(x, \\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)}$.\nWe are interested in the behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ for small positive $\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\n**2. Identify the source of singular behavior**\n\n*   For any $x > 0$ in the integration range, as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the integrand approaches $\\frac{1}{P(x)}$.\n*   At $x=0$, $P(0) = 0$. This means that as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the denominator $\\epsilon + P(x)$ becomes very small for $x$ close to 0, causing the integrand to become very large.\n*   The integral $\\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{P(x)}$ would diverge because near $x=0$, $P(x) \\approx 9x^5$, and the integral $\\int_0^{\\delta} \\frac{dx}{9x^5}$ diverges like a p-integral with $p=5 > 1$.\n*   This divergence as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ means the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n**3. Approximate the integrand in the dominant region**\n\nSince the main contribution comes from small $x$, we can approximate the polynomial $P(x)$ by its term of the lowest degree:\n$P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\nThe other terms, $5x^6$ and $9x^8$, are much smaller than $9x^5$ when $x$ is close to zero.\n\n**4. Approximate the integral**\n\nWe can now approximate the integral by replacing $P(x)$ with its leading term, $9x^5$.\nAlso, because the contribution from larger $x$ is negligible compared to the blow-up near $x=0$, we can extend the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$. This simplifies the calculation without significantly affecting the result for the leading-order approximation.\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**5. Evaluate the approximate integral**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables to make it dimensionless. Let's make the substitution that balances the two terms in the denominator.\nLet $9x^5 = \\epsilon u$.\nThis gives $x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon u}{9}$, so $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon u}{9}\\right)^{1/5} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5} u^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}}$.\nThe differential is $dx = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5} du$.\nThe limits of integration remain from 0 to $\\infty$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5} \\right) du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1+u)} \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} u^{-4/5} du$\nFactor out the terms depending on $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{\\epsilon \\cdot 5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n\n**6. Recognize and use the Beta Function**\n\nThe remaining integral is a standard integral representation of the Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{p-1}}{1+t} dt = B(p, 1-p)$\nThis is also related to the Gamma function by the reflection formula:\n$B(p, 1-p) = \\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(1-p) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi p)}$\n\nIn our case, the exponent is $-4/5$. So, $p-1 = -4/5$, which means $p=1/5$.\nThe integral is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{1/5 - 1}}{1+u} du = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**7. State the final analytical formula**\n\nCombining the results, we get the analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\nThis formula captures the dominant behavior of the integral as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n\nLet's write down the final result clearly. The powers in the problem are given with decimals, so we will keep them in the formula as fractions for analytical precision.\n$p=5.0$, $c=9.0$. The leading behavior is given by $\\epsilon^{(1-p)/p} = \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\nThe coefficient is $\\frac{\\pi}{p \\cdot c^{1/p} \\sin(\\pi/p)}$.\n\nFinal formula:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4.0/5.0}$\n\nAlternatively, using the Gamma function notation:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nBoth forms are equivalent. The one with $\\pi$ and sine is common.\n\n<<<I(eps) = (pi / (5.0 * (9.0**(1.0/5.0)) * sin(pi/5.0))) * eps**(-4.0/5.0)>>>"
