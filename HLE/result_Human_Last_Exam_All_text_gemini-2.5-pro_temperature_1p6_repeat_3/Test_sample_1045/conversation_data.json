    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Atoms and their Counts in the Molecule**\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula for toluene and count the number of each type of atom.\n*   Molecule: Toluene\n*   Chemical Formula: C₇H₈\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation**\nThe name \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to interpret this notation for each type of atom (heavy atoms like Carbon and light atoms like Hydrogen).\n\n*   **The hyphen (-)** separates the description of the core atomic orbitals from the valence atomic orbitals.\n*   **The first number (6-)**: This applies to the core orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single CGF, which is a sum of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **The numbers after the hyphen (31G)**: This applies to the valence orbitals. This is a \"split-valence\" or \"double-zeta\" description, meaning each valence orbital is represented by two basis functions of different sizes.\n    *   The \"3\" means the inner part of the valence orbital is described by one CGF composed of 3 PGFs.\n    *   The \"1\" means the outer part of the valence orbital is described by one CGF composed of 1 PGF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Contracted Functions for a Carbon Atom (C)**\nA carbon atom (atomic number 6) has the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core Orbital (1s):** The 1s orbital is a core orbital. According to the \"6-\" part of the basis set name, it is represented by **1 Contracted Gaussian Function (CGF)**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The 2s and 2p orbitals (which include 2px, 2py, 2pz) are valence orbitals. They are split into an inner and an outer part according to the \"-31G\" description.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part (\"3\"):** This includes one function for the 2s orbital and one function for each of the three 2p orbitals.\n        *   1 CGF for the 2s orbital.\n        *   3 CGFs for the 2p orbitals (one each for 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   Total for the inner part = 1 + 3 = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence Part (\"1\"):** This also includes one function for the 2s orbital and one for each 2p orbital.\n        *   1 CGF for the 2s orbital.\n        *   3 CGFs for the 2p orbitals (one each for 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   Total for the outer part = 1 + 3 = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom** = (Core CGFs) + (Inner Valence CGFs) + (Outer Valence CGFs) = 1 + 4 + 4 = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Contracted Functions for a Hydrogen Atom (H)**\nA hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has the electron configuration 1s¹.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The 1s orbital is a valence orbital.\n*   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The 1s orbital is treated according to the \"-31G\" split-valence description.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part (\"3\"):** Represented by **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Outer Valence Part (\"1\"):** Represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom** = (Inner CGF) + (Outer CGF) = 1 + 1 = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Functions for Toluene (C₇H₈)**\nNow, we sum the functions for all the atoms in the molecule.\n*   Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs.\n*   Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs.\n*   **Total Contracted Gaussian Functions** = 63 + 16 = **79 CGFs**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Molecule Composition:** Ensure the correct number of atoms for the molecule (7 Carbons and 8 Hydrogens for toluene).\n2.  **Core vs. Valence:** Correctly identify which orbitals are core and which are valence for each atom type. For second-row elements like Carbon, 1s is core. For Hydrogen, the 1s is valence.\n3.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Understand that 6-31G means one CGF for core orbitals and a double-zeta representation (two CGFs) for each valence orbital.\n4.  **Number of p-orbitals:** Remember that a p-shell consists of 3 orbitals (px, py, pz). Therefore, a \"set of p-functions\" always contributes 3 contracted functions.\n5.  **Contracted vs. Primitive:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* functions (CGFs), not the underlying *primitive* functions (PGFs). The numbers in \"6-31G\" refer to the number of PGFs used to build the CGFs, but the number of CGFs itself is determined by the structure of the basis set (i.e., one function for core, two for valence).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n*   **Atoms:** 7 x Carbon, 8 x Hydrogen\n*   **Basis Functions per Carbon:** 1 (for 1s core) + 4 (for inner 2s, 2p) + 4 (for outer 2s, 2p) = 9\n*   **Basis Functions per Hydrogen:** 1 (for inner 1s) + 1 (for outer 1s) = 2\n*   **Total Calculation:** (7 * 9) + (8 * 2) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
