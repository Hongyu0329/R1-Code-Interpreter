    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon, which helps to definitively identify the location.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Action:** This feature was \"removed.\"\n    *   **Timeframe:** \"until 1950,\" meaning it was removed in or around that year.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination of Incorrect Possibilities:**\n    *   **The Pantheon itself?** No, it's still there.\n    *   **The Fontana del Pantheon (fountain)?** No, the fountain with its central obelisk is still the centerpiece of the square.\n    *   **The Pantheon's Bell Towers?** This is a common piece of trivia. The Pantheon did have two bell towers added by Bernini in the 17th century, often nicknamed the \"donkey's ears.\" However, they were removed in **1883**, not 1950. This does not match the timeframe.\n    *   **Buildings surrounding the Piazza?** Many medieval and Renaissance-era buildings that were built up against the Pantheon were demolished to \"liberate\" the monument and create the piazza as we know it. Most of this work, however, was done much earlier, primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This does not fit the 1950 date.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the 1950 Timeframe and the \"Feature\" Type:**\n    *   The year 1950 falls in the post-WWII reconstruction and modernization period in Italy. Cities were re-evaluating their infrastructure.\n    *   The term \"architectural feature\" can be interpreted broadly to include significant elements that define the character and use of a space, even if they are not buildings. This could include infrastructure.\n    *   Research into Rome's urban development during this period reveals a major change in its public transport system.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Feature:**\n    *   Historical photographs and city records from the first half of the 20th century show a **tramway line** running directly through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    *   The tram tracks ran across the cobblestones, passing right in front of the Pantheon's portico, between the church and the central fountain.\n    *   This was indeed a \"unique\" feature, as the sight of a modern electric tram clattering past a 2,000-year-old temple was a stark and memorable contrast.\n    *   In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the city administration of Rome decided to dismantle many of the tram lines in the historic center. The reasons were to reduce traffic congestion, lessen the vibrations that could damage ancient monuments, and improve the aesthetic appearance of the historic squares.\n    *   The tram line through the Piazza della Rotonda was removed as part of this program, fitting the 1950 timeframe perfectly. The removal of the tracks and overhead power lines restored the square's architectural integrity.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Date is Key:** The year 1950 is the critical piece of information that distinguishes the correct answer from other historical changes in the piazza (like the removal of the bell towers in 1883).\n*   **Definition of \"Architectural Feature\":** One must interpret this term broadly to include major infrastructural elements that have a profound impact on the visual and functional character of an architectural space. The tram line, with its tracks embedded in the pavement and its overhead wires, certainly qualifies.\n*   **Verification:** The existence and subsequent removal of the tram line are well-documented in historical archives and old photographs of Rome.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe unique feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed around 1950 was the public tramway line that passed directly through the square.\n\n<<<The tramway line>>>"
