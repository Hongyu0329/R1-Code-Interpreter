The primary reason a functional MRI receive coil might not show resonance when probed is that it is in its default **decoupled (detuned) state**. Modern coils are active devices with safety circuits (often using PIN diodes) that detune the coil when it is not actively receiving a signal from the scanner. This prevents damage from the high-power transmit pulse. When tested on a bench without the specific DC bias voltage required to activate its "receive mode," the coil remains in this safe, non-resonant state. A secondary key reason is that integrated preamplifiers, which are essential for the coil's tuning and matching, are unpowered during the bench test, thus preventing the circuit from resonating correctly.
