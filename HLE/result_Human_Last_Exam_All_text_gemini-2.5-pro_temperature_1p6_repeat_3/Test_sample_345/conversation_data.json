    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key components of the question:** The question asks for the specific museum that acquired a particular artwork in a specific year.\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Creation Date:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Acquisition Date:** 1967\n\n2.  **Formulate a search strategy:** The most effective approach is to search for the artwork and artist together, and then look for collection or provenance information. A search query like `\"Kurt Günther\" \"The Radionist\" museum acquisition` is a good starting point.\n\n3.  **Execute the search and evaluate sources:** The search results consistently point to one major institution: the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).\n\n4.  **Verify with a primary source:** The most reliable source is the museum's own online collection database.\n    *   A search on the LACMA website for \"Kurt Günther\" confirms they have the painting \"The Radionist\" (German title: \"Der Radionist\").\n    *   The museum's record for this painting verifies all the initial details: artist Kurt Günther, title \"The Radionist\", date 1927, and medium \"Tempera on canvas\".\n\n5.  **Confirm the acquisition date:** The crucial final step is to check the acquisition information provided by LACMA for this artwork.\n    *   The LACMA record includes an \"Accession Number\": M.67.16. In museum cataloging, the first two digits of an accession number often represent the year the object entered the collection. \"67\" corresponds to the year 1967.\n    *   Furthermore, the credit line often explicitly states the acquisition details. The record for this painting states: \"Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Dalzell Hatfield\". The museum's records confirm this gift was made in 1967.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing Creation vs. Acquisition:** It's important not to confuse the painting's creation date (1927) with the date it was acquired by the museum (1967).\n*   **Primary Source Verification:** Always try to confirm information from a primary source, like the museum itself, rather than relying solely on secondary sources like articles or indexes.\n*   **Accession Numbers:** Understanding how museum accession numbers are structured can be a valuable clue in determining the acquisition year.\n*   **Artist and Title Spelling:** Using the correct spelling for both the artist (Kurt Günther) and the artwork (\"The Radionist\" or \"Der Radionist\") is essential for an accurate search.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the museum.\n\n<<<Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)>>>"
