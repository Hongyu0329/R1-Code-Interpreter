    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's key elements.**\nThe question asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film containing a very precise set of circumstances:\n1.  **Oscar-nominated film:** The movie must have received at least one Academy Award nomination.\n2.  **A character seals his fate:** The action is a point of no return, leading to a significant, negative outcome for the character.\n3.  **The line of dialogue is \"Thank you\":** These specific words are the trigger.\n4.  **The setting is \"while boarding a bus\":** This action takes place at a bus station or as the character is getting on a bus.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or search for films matching these criteria.**\nThe combination of these elements is very distinctive. The scene that immediately comes to mind is from the Coen Brothers' film *No Country for Old Men*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specific scene in *No Country for Old Men* to see if it matches all criteria.**\n*   **The film:** *No Country for Old Men* (2007).\n*   **Is it Oscar-nominated?** Yes. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Javier Bardem. This fits the first criterion.\n*   **The character:** Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin).\n*   **The situation:** Moss is on the run from the hitman Anton Chigurh and a Mexican cartel after taking a suitcase of money from a drug deal gone wrong. Wounded and desperate, he crosses into Mexico and ends up at a bus station, trying to escape.\n*   **The action:** At the bus station, Moss needs a new shirt or jacket. He gives some money to a young local man in exchange for his jacket. The man says something to Moss in Spanish. Not understanding, Moss politely replies in English, \"Thank you.\"\n*   **How it seals his fate:** Another man, a member of the cartel hunting Moss, was asking around for an American. He asks the young man what Moss said to him. The young man replies that Moss said, \"Thank you.\" This simple, polite English phrase confirms to the hunter that Moss is the American they are looking for. They are then able to track him from the bus station to his nearby motel room, where they kill him (off-screen). His use of English, rather than Spanish, is the piece of information that leads directly to his death. This fits all the remaining criteria perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe film *No Country for Old Men* features the character Llewelyn Moss, who, while attempting to leave town via bus, confirms his identity to his killers by politely saying \"Thank you\" in English. The film was a major Oscar winner, fulfilling all the conditions of the question.\n\n<<<No Country for Old Men>>>"
