    "An analysis of the problem to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$, denoted $Q_{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 3$), is given by the presentation:\n$Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor the group of size 128, we have $2^n = 128$, which implies $n=7$. So we are considering the group $G = Q_{128}$:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nThe elements of $G$ can be written in the form $x^i$ or $x^iy$ for $0 \\le i < 64$. The order of the group is $|G| = 128$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way for $G=Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the problem by analyzing the exponent k**\n\nAny integer $k$ can be written in the form $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $j \\ge 0$.\nLet's consider the map $\\phi_m: G \\to G$ defined by $\\phi_m(g) = g^m$. Since the order of our group is $|G|=128=2^7$, and $m$ is odd, we have $\\gcd(m, |G|) = 1$. For any finite group, if $\\gcd(k, |G|) = 1$, the map $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a bijection. Thus, $\\phi_m$ is a permutation of the elements of $G$.\nThis means that the set of $m$-th powers is the group itself: $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\} = G$.\n\nNow we can analyze $G^k$:\n$G^k = G^{2^j m} = \\{g^{2^j m} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{(g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nSince the set of elements $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is the same as the set of elements $\\{g \\mid g \\in G\\}$, we can write:\n$G^k = \\{h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in G\\} = G^{2^j}$.\n\nThis significantly simplifies the problem: we only need to compute the power subgroups for $k$ being powers of 2, i.e., $k=2^j$ for $j \\ge 0$. All other values of $k$ will produce one of these subgroups.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the power subgroups G^(2^j)**\n\nWe will calculate the set $G^{2^j}$ for $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ and identify the distinct subgroups formed.\nThe elements of $G$ are of two types: those in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ (of the form $x^i$), and those not in it (of the form $x^iy$).\n\n*   **Case j = 0 (k=1):**\n    $G^1 = \\{g^1 \\mid g \\in G\\} = G = Q_{128}$. This is the first power subgroup. Note that this subgroup is also generated by any odd power $k$.\n\n*   **To handle j >= 1, we first need to understand the powers of elements of the form x^i y.**\n    Let's calculate $(x^i y)^2$:\n    $(x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i (y x^i y^{-1}) y^2 = x^i(x^{-i})y^2 = y^2$.\n    From the group presentation, $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, for any $i$, $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$.\n    This implies $(x^i y)^4 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$. So every element of the form $x^iy$ has order 4.\n\nNow we can proceed with other values of $j$.\n\n*   **Case j = 1 (k=2):**\n    $G^2 = \\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{ (x^i)^2 \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\} \\cup \\{ (x^iy)^2 \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\}$.\n    The first set is $\\{x^{2i} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$, which is precisely the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$. This subgroup has order $64/2=32$.\n    The second set is $\\{x^{32}\\}$ since $(x^iy)^2=x^{32}$ for all $i$.\n    So, $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32}\\}$.\n    Since $x^{32} = (x^2)^{16}$, the element $x^{32}$ is already in $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 32, and it's our second distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case j = 2 (k=4):**\n    $G^4 = \\{g^4 \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{ (x^i)^4 \\} \\cup \\{ (x^iy)^4 \\}$.\n    The first set is $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n    The second set is $\\{1\\}$, since $(x^iy)^4 = 1$.\n    So, $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/4=16$. This is our third distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case j >= 2:**\n    For any $j \\ge 2$, the term $(x^iy)^{2^j}$ can be calculated as $((x^iy)^4)^{2^{j-2}} = 1^{2^{j-2}} = 1$.\n    So, for $j \\ge 2$, $G^{2^j} = \\{ (x^i)^{2^j} \\} \\cup \\{ 1 \\} = \\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\nLet's list the subgroups for $j \\ge 2$:\n*   **j = 3 (k=8):** $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order $64/8=8$. (4th power subgroup)\n*   **j = 4 (k=16):** $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order $64/16=4$. (5th power subgroup)\n*   **j = 5 (k=32):** $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order $64/32=2$. This is the center of the group, $Z(Q_{128})$. (6th power subgroup)\n*   **j = 6 (k=64):** $G^{64} = \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup. (7th power subgroup)\n*   **j >= 7 (k >= 128):** $G^{2^j} = \\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, since $x^{64}=1$. These do not produce new subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct subgroups**\n\nWe have found the following distinct power subgroups:\n1.  $G^1 = Q_{128}$ (the group itself)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (cyclic of order 32)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (cyclic of order 16)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (cyclic of order 8)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (cyclic of order 4)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (cyclic of order 2)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThese seven subgroups are all distinct. Counting them, we find there are 7 power subgroups."
