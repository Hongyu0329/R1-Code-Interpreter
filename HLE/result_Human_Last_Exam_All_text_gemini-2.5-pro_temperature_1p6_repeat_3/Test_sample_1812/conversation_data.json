    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computation:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix, `A`.\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe reference to \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides context for where this matrix might arise but does not change the mathematical task of computing its determinant.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Calculating the Determinant**\nFor a 3x3 matrix, we can use the standard formula for determinants, also known as the cofactor expansion along the first row. The formula is:\nFor a matrix\n\\[\nM = \\begin{bmatrix}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant is given by:\n`det(M) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Formula to Matrix A**\nLet's identify the elements of matrix `A` according to the formula:\n*   `a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n*   `d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n*   `g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n\nNow, substitute these values into the determinant formula:\n`det(A) = 2 * ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))`\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation Step by Step**\n\n1.  **Calculate the first term:**\n    `2 * ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1))`\n    `= 2 * (4 - 1)`\n    `= 2 * (3)`\n    `= 6`\n\n2.  **Calculate the second term:**\n    `- (-1) * ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1))`\n    `= +1 * (-2 - 1)`\n    `= 1 * (-3)`\n    `= -3`\n\n3.  **Calculate the third term:**\n    `+ (-1) * ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))`\n    `= -1 * (1 - (-2))`\n    `= -1 * (1 + 2)`\n    `= -1 * (3)`\n    `= -3`\n\n4.  **Sum the terms to find the final determinant:**\n    `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3`\n    `det(A) = 0`\n\n**Careful Points and Alternative Method:**\n\n1.  **Sign Convention:** A common mistake is messing up the signs. Remember the cofactor expansion has alternating signs (`+`, `-`, `+`). Also, be careful with the negative numbers within the matrix itself.\n2.  **Matrix Properties (Shortcut):** Notice that the sum of the elements in each row of matrix `A` is zero.\n    *   Row 1: `2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0`\n    *   Row 2: `-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0`\n    *   Row 3: `-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0`\n    A property of square matrices states that if the sum of the elements in each row (or each column) is zero, then the determinant of the matrix is zero. This is because the vector of all ones, `[1, 1, 1]^T`, is an eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of 0. Since the determinant is the product of all eigenvalues, and one eigenvalue is 0, the determinant must be 0. This provides a quick confirmation of our result.\n3.  **Context:** The matrix A is the graph Laplacian of the complete graph on three vertices, K3. The determinant of the Laplacian matrix of any connected graph is always 0.\n\nBased on the detailed calculation and the properties of the matrix, the final answer is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
