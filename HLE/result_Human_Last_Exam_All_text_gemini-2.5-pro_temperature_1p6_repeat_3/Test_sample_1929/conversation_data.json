    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene)**\n    *   Chemical Formula: C₄H₆\n    *   Structure: CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂\n    *   Functional Group: It is a conjugated diene, meaning it has two double bonds separated by a single bond. This is a key requirement for one of the reactants in a Diels-Alder reaction. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt the *s-cis* conformation.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Chemical Formula: C₂Cl₂F₂\n    *   Structure: CCl₂=CF₂\n    *   Functional Group: It is a substituted alkene. The chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) atoms are highly electronegative, making them strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). An alkene with EWGs is known as a dienophile and is highly reactive in Diels-Alder reactions.\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a specific type of pericyclic reaction known as a [4+2] cycloaddition, where the \"4\" represents the four pi electrons of the diene and the \"2\" represents the two pi electrons of the dienophile. This reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the product's structure.**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process, meaning all bonds are formed and broken in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n1.  Align the diene (in its *s-cis* form) and the dienophile.\n2.  Visualize the electron movement:\n    *   The four carbons of the diene and the two carbons of the dienophile will form the new six-membered ring.\n    *   New single bonds (sigma bonds) will form between the terminal carbons of the diene (C1 and C4) and the two carbons of the dienophile.\n    *   The double bond in the dienophile will become a single bond.\n    *   The two double bonds in the diene will be rearranged: the single bond between C2 and C3 of the diene will become a double bond, and the double bonds between C1-C2 and C3-C4 will become single bonds.\n\nLet's trace the atoms to build the product:\n*   The `CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂` and `CCl₂=CF₂` react.\n*   The resulting six-membered ring will contain the following groups attached to the carbon backbone: `-CH₂-`, `-CH=`, `=CH-`, `-CH₂-`, `-C(Cl)₂-`, and `-C(F)₂-`.\n*   The connectivity will be a ring structure where the `-CH₂-` groups are adjacent to the halogenated carbons, and the `-CH=` groups form the double bond in the ring. The structure is as follows:\n\n      H₂C -- CH=CH -- CH₂\n      |                |\n     C(F₂) --------- C(Cl₂)\n\n**Step 3: Name the product using IUPAC nomenclature.**\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The core structure is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so the parent name is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Numbering the Ring:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond must be given the lowest possible numbers, i.e., C1 and C2.\n3.  **Locating Substituents:** We number the ring in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Let's start numbering from the double bond.\n    *   If we number the `CH=CH` carbons as 1 and 2, the adjacent `CH₂` groups are at positions 3 and 6. This leaves the `CCl₂` and `CF₂` groups at positions 4 and 5.\n4.  **Applying Alphabetical Order:** The substituents are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\". IUPAC rules state that if there is a choice in numbering, the group cited first in the name should be assigned the lower number.\n5.  **Final Name:** Therefore, the `CCl₂` group is on carbon 4, and the `CF₂` group is on carbon 5. The full IUPAC name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Regiochemistry:** Because the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetric, there is only one possible regioisomeric product. It doesn't matter which end of the diene attacks which end of the asymmetric dienophile; the resulting product is the same.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. However, since the dienophile has two identical atoms on each carbon (geminal substituents), no new stereocenters (chiral centers) are formed in this specific reaction. The product is achiral.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** This reaction is typically carried out by heating the reactants together (thermal cycloaddition).\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\nThe reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring. The product is a derivative of cyclohexene, specifically named 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
