    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a very specific count of a particular ballet step:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Act:** Act I\n*   **Variation:** Kitri's solo variation\n*   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors\n*   **Preparation:** From the fifth position\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation**\nKitri's variation in Act I of *Don Quixote* is a famous and technically demanding solo. It is characterized by high energy, sharp movements, strong jumps, and a notable sequence of turns. To answer the question, we must analyze the specific types of turns within this variation as it was performed by Osipova.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Turning Sequences in the Variation**\nUpon reviewing recordings of Natalia Osipova performing this variation with the Bolshoi Ballet during that period, we can identify the main turning sequences:\n1.  **A diagonal of turns:** The most prominent turning sequence in the variation is a series of turns traveling across the stage, typically on a diagonal.\n2.  **Chaîné turns:** Towards the end of the variation, there is often a sequence of rapid, linking turns (chaînés) performed in a line or circle to build to the finale.\n\n**Step 4: Differentiate Between Piqué Turns and Pirouettes from Fifth Position**\nThis is the most critical point for answering the question accurately.\n*   A **pirouette from the fifth position** begins with the dancer in fifth position, performing a *plié* (bending the knees) and then pushing off from both feet into a *relevé* on one leg to execute the turn.\n*   A **piqué turn**, which is what is characteristically performed in the famous diagonal sequence of this variation, is a traveling turn. The dancer steps directly onto the pointe or demi-pointe of a straight leg, and the other leg is \"pricked\" up into a retiré position to turn. The preparation is not a plié in fifth position.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Analysis to Osipova's Performance**\nWhen we analyze Natalia Osipova's performance of the Act I variation, we observe the following:\n*   The famous diagonal of turns she performs consists of **piqué turns**, not pirouettes from the fifth position. While they are single turns and are *en dehors* (outward), their preparation and execution do not match the specific criteria of the question.\n*   The variation also includes other steps like fouetté jumps (*grand jeté en tournant*) and ends with fast chaîné turns.\n*   There is no point in the standard choreography of this variation, as performed by Osipova, that includes a series of single-turn pirouettes initiated from a fifth position plié.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a technical analysis of the ballet steps within the specified choreography, the step \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" is not performed. The iconic turning sequence uses piqué turns instead. Therefore, the number of times this specific step is performed is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
