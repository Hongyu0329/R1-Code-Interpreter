Let $\mu_{\text{T2-Bound}}(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-c}{\sigma_x}\right)^2\right)$ represent a Gaussian-based bound (either upper or lower) of an embedded Interval Type-2 membership function. The mathematical formulation that characterizes the corresponding bound for the vertical cross-section of an Interval Type-3 membership function, $\mu_{\text{IT3-Bound}}(x, u)$, is given by:
$\mu_{\text{IT3-Bound}}(x, u) = \mu_{\text{T2-Bound}}(x) \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{u - \mu_{\text{T2-Bound}}(x)}{\sigma_u}\right)^2\right)$
Here, $x$ is the primary input variable, $u$ is the secondary input variable representing the membership grade, $c$ and $\sigma_x$ are the parameters of the embedded Type-2 Gaussian bound, and $\sigma_u$ is a parameter that defines the spread of the uncertainty in the vertical cross-section.
