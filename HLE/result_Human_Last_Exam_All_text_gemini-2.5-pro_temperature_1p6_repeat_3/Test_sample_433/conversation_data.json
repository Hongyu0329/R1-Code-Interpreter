    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Terms:**\n    *   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** The time after which a preparation should not be used. For an opened source container, this refers to how long it can be kept after being opened before it must be discarded.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A container holding a sterile drug intended for a single use. It lacks an antimicrobial preservative.\n    *   **Ampule:** A specific type of SDC made of glass that is sealed and broken open at the neck. A critical feature is that it **cannot be resealed** after opening.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC), which provides a very clean environment for sterile compounding.\n\n2.  **Consult the Governing Standard:**\n    *   The primary source for rules on sterile compounding and BUDs is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations. This chapter sets the standards to prevent contamination and ensure patient safety.\n\n3.  **Apply the Specific Rule from USP <797>:**\n    *   USP <797> provides explicit rules for handling opened SDCs, and it makes a crucial distinction between container types.\n    *   **Rule for Ampules:** Once an ampule is broken open, it becomes an open-system container. It is completely exposed to the environment, and there is no way to close it to protect the contents from contamination. Because of this, USP <797> mandates that the contents of an opened ampule must be used **immediately**.\n    *   The chapter states that opened ampules **cannot be stored for any period**. After the necessary volume of medication is withdrawn, both the ampule and any remaining contents must be discarded immediately.\n\n4.  **Identify Careful Points and Common Mistakes:**\n    *   **Distinguishing Ampules from Vials:** This is the most common point of confusion. A single-dose *vial* has a rubber stopper that maintains a seal even after being punctured. For a single-dose vial opened in an ISO Class 5 environment, USP <797> allows a BUD of up to **12 hours**. This 12-hour rule **does not apply to ampules**.\n    *   **Meaning of \"Immediate Use\":** In the context of an opened ampule, \"immediate use\" means there is no allowable storage time. The user must withdraw the medication and then discard the container without delay.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the definitive guidelines from USP <797>, a single-dose ampule, once opened (punctured/broken), must be used immediately. It cannot be stored, regardless of the fact that it was opened in a sterile environment. Any unused portion must be discarded.\n\n<<<Immediate use only. The opened ampule cannot be stored for any period of time and must be discarded after the initial use.>>>"
