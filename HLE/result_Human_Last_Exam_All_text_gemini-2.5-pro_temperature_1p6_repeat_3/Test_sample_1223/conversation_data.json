    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. This is a stronger condition. An example is the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder ($Y^*$):** The set of points added to $Y$ to form its Stone-Cech compactification, i.e., $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The composants form a partition of the continuum.\n\n**2. Characterize the Space Whose Remainder is Being Analyzed**\n\nThe question asks about the Stone-Cech remainder of $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x \\in X$.\n\n*   Since $X$ is a continuum (connected and containing at least two points, as hereditary indecomposability implies non-degeneracy), removing a single point $x$ does not disconnect the space if $x$ is not a cut point.\n*   In any indecomposable continuum, no point is a cut point. If $x$ were a cut point, $X \\setminus \\{x\\} = A \\cup B$ for disjoint non-empty open sets $A, B$. Then $X = (A \\cup \\{x\\}) \\cup (B \\cup \\{x\\})$. The closures $\\overline{A} = A \\cup \\{x\\}$ and $\\overline{B} = B \\cup \\{x\\}$ would be proper subcontinua whose union is $X$, contradicting indecomposability.\n*   Therefore, $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a connected space.\n*   As an open subset of a compact metric space, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact, separable, and metrizable space.\n\n**3. Characterize the Stone-Cech Remainder**\n\nLet $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ be the Stone-Cech remainder. We need to determine its topological properties.\n\n*   **Indecomposability:** A key theorem by D. P. Bellamy (1970) states that for any indecomposable continuum $K$ and any point $p \\in K$, the remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum. Since our $X$ is hereditary indecomposable, it is also indecomposable. Thus, $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n*   **Non-degeneracy:** A remainder $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$ is a single point if and only if $Y$ is pseudocompact. For a locally compact, $\\sigma$-compact space like our $Y$, pseudocompactness is equivalent to compactness. Since $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is not compact, its remainder $R$ is not a single point. It is a non-degenerate continuum.\n*   **Metrizability:** The one-point compactification of $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is the original space $X$, where $x$ serves as the \"point at infinity\". A known theorem in topology states that for a locally compact, separable space $Y$, its Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$ is metrizable if and only if the point at infinity in its one-point compactification has a countable neighborhood basis. Since $X$ is a metric space, every point, including $x$, has a countable neighborhood basis. Therefore, the remainder $R$ is a metrizable space.\n\nSo, we have established that the remainder $R$ is a **non-degenerate, indecomposable, metric continuum**.\n\n**4. Determine the Number of Composants**\n\nThe question now simplifies to finding the number of composants of a non-degenerate, indecomposable, metric continuum.\n\n*   This is answered by a classical theorem of Stefan Mazurkiewicz. The theorem states that every non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\n*   Each of these $c$ composants is a dense subset of the continuum.\n\n**5. Conclude the Maximum Possible Number**\n\n*   Our analysis shows that for *any* hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and *any* point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-degenerate, indecomposable, metric continuum.\n*   According to Mazurkiewicz's theorem, any such space has exactly $c$ composants.\n*   This means the number of composants is a constant value, $c$, regardless of the specific choice of $X$ or $x$ (within the given class of spaces).\n*   The question asks for the *maximum possible* number of a composants. Since the number is always $c$, the maximum is also $c$.\n\n*(Note: The condition that $X$ is hereditary indecomposable is stronger than what is needed for this argument, which only requires $X$ to be an indecomposable metric continuum. However, the conclusion remains the same.)*\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{c}$."
