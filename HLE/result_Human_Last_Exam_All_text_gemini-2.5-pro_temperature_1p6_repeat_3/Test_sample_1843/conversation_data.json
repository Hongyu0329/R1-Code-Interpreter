    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, $N = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Primitive Characters and their Decomposition\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where $\\chi_{d}$ is a character modulo $d$.\n\nA crucial property is that $\\chi$ is a **primitive** character of conductor $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{d}$ is a primitive character of conductor $d$.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Order of a Product Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$o(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o(\\chi_{4}), o(\\chi_{9}), o(\\chi_{7}), o(\\chi_{11}), o(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters where $o(\\chi) = 6$. This implies two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character, $o(\\chi_{d})$, must divide 6.\n2.  The lcm of the orders must be exactly 6. This means that there must be at least one component whose order is divisible by 2, and at least one component whose order is divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Component Character\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each modulus $d \\in \\{4, 9, 7, 11, 13\\}$ whose order divides 6.\n\n**For modulus $d=4$ ($2^2$):**\n*   The group of Dirichlet characters mod 4, $\\mathcal{G}_4$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$.\n*   There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. One is principal (conductor 1, order 1), the other is primitive.\n*   The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(4) - \\phi(2) = 2-1=1$.\n*   This primitive character has order 2. Since $2|6$, it is a valid choice.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: **1**. (Its order is 2).\n\n**For modulus $d=9$ ($3^2$):**\n*   The group of characters $\\mathcal{G}_9$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(9)} = C_6$.\n*   A character $\\chi_9$ is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3^{2-1}) = \\phi(3)=2$.\n*   The possible orders of characters in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n*   The orders that do not divide 2 are 3 and 6. So, any primitive character mod 9 must have order 3 or 6.\n*   Both 3 and 6 divide 6, so all primitive characters mod 9 are valid choices.\n*   Number of characters of order 3 in $C_6$ is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6 in $C_6$ is $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   Total number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$. (Orders are 3 or 6).\n\n**For modulus $d=7$ (a prime):**\n*   The group of characters $\\mathcal{G}_7 \\cong C_{\\phi(7)} = C_6$.\n*   A character is primitive if it is not the principal character (whose order is 1).\n*   The orders of the non-principal characters are 2, 3, 6. All of these divide 6.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   Total number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$. (Orders are 2, 3, or 6).\n\n**For modulus $d=11$ (a prime):**\n*   The group of characters $\\mathcal{G}_{11} \\cong C_{\\phi(11)} = C_{10}$.\n*   $\\chi_{11}$ must be primitive, so its order is greater than 1.\n*   The order must divide 6, so $o(\\chi_{11})$ must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$.\n*   Therefore, the only possible order for a primitive character is 2.\n*   Number of characters of order 2 in $C_{10}$ is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: **1**. (Its order is 2).\n\n**For modulus $d=13$ (a prime):**\n*   The group of characters $\\mathcal{G}_{13} \\cong C_{\\phi(13)} = C_{12}$.\n*   $\\chi_{13}$ must be primitive, so its order is greater than 1.\n*   The order must divide 6, so the possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n*   Number of characters of order 2 in $C_{12}$ is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3 in $C_{12}$ is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6 in $C_{12}$ is $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   Total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$. (Orders are 2, 3, or 6).\n\n### Step 5: Combine the results and verify the lcm condition\nWe have found the number of valid choices for each component character, such that each is primitive and its order divides 6. Now we assemble the final character $\\chi$ and check if its order is exactly 6.\n\nLet the tuple of orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\nFrom our analysis:\n*   $o_4 = 2$\n*   $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{11} = 2$\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe lcm is $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n*   **Divisibility by 2:** Since $o_4=2$ (and $o_{11}=2$), the lcm is always divisible by 2.\n*   **Divisibility by 3:** Since $o_9$ must be either 3 or 6, the order of any valid choice for $\\chi_9$ is divisible by 3. Thus, the lcm is always divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nAlso, since every component's order divides 6, their lcm must divide 6.\nTherefore, for any combination of the valid choices we found, the resulting character $\\chi$ will have an order of exactly 6.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Total Number\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
