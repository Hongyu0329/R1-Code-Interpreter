    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify all crystal classes that satisfy three specific symmetry conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure can be superimposed on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique polar direction.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: The crystal's symmetry allows it to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\nThere is a potential contradiction in these requirements, specifically between being \"achiral\" and being \"optically active\". Let's analyze each condition carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze \"Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity\"\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the question.\n\n*   **Common Definition (Chirality)**: Often, optical activity is defined as being synonymous with chirality. A crystal is considered optically active if and only if its point group is chiral (i.e., it lacks any rotoinversion axes, $\\overline{n}$). Rotoinversion axes include a center of inversion ($\\overline{1}$) and a mirror plane ($m$, which is equivalent to $\\overline{2}$). According to this definition, only the 11 chiral crystal classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432) are optically active. If we use this definition, then a class cannot be both achiral and optically active, making the answer \"None\".\n\n*   **Fundamental Physical Definition (Gyration Tensor)**: A more rigorous physical approach looks at the material's response to light. Optical activity is an effect of spatial dispersion, described by a second-rank axial tensor called the **gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$)**. For a crystal to be optically active, its point group symmetry must allow for at least one non-zero component in the gyration tensor.\n    *   A center of symmetry ($\\overline{1}$) forces all components of $g_{ij}$ to be zero. Thus, all centrosymmetric classes are optically inactive.\n    *   Most, but not all, other improper rotations (like mirror planes) also force all components of $g_{ij}$ to be zero.\n    *   Analysis shows that the gyration tensor is not forced to be identically zero in the 11 chiral classes, and also in two specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: **$m$** and **$\\overline{4}$**.\n\nGiven the specific wording of the question, it likely probes this deeper physical definition rather than relying on the simplified \"optical activity = chirality\" rule. Therefore, we will consider the set of classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity to be **{the 11 chiral classes, $m$, $\\overline{4}$}**.\n\n#### Step 2: Apply the \"Achiral\" Condition\n\n*   **Definition**: A crystal class is achiral if its point group contains at least one rotoinversion symmetry element ($\\overline{n}$). This means the structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   We now filter the set from Step 1: {11 chiral classes, $m$, $\\overline{4}$}.\n    *   The 11 chiral classes are, by definition, not achiral. They are eliminated.\n    *   The class **$m$** contains a mirror plane, which is a rotoinversion axis ($\\overline{2}$). Therefore, it is **achiral**.\n    *   The class **$\\overline{4}$** contains a 4-fold rotoinversion axis. Therefore, it is also **achiral**.\n\nAfter applying this condition, our list of candidate classes is reduced to **{$m$, $\\overline{4}$}**.\n\n#### Step 3: Apply the \"Non-polar\" Condition\n\n*   **Definition**: A crystal class is non-polar if it is not polar. A polar class is one that has a unique axis or direction where the two ends are not related by any symmetry operation in the group. There are 10 polar crystal classes.\n*   The 10 polar classes are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, $m$, $mm2$, $3m$, $4mm$, $6mm$**.\n*   We now filter our candidate list {**$m$**, **$\\overline{4}$**} using this condition.\n    *   The class **$m$** is in the list of polar classes. Therefore, it is **polar** and must be eliminated.\n    *   The class **$\\overline{4}$** is not in the list of polar classes. It is **non-polar**. The reason is that the unique axis (the $\\overline{4}$ axis) contains a 2-fold proper rotation axis ($C_2$), which relates a direction $[uvw]$ to $[\\overline{u}\\overline{v}w]$, and the $\\overline{4}$ operation relates $[00w]$ to $[00\\overline{w}]$. Thus, no direction is uniquely polar.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nAfter applying all three conditions sequentially, only one crystal class remains.\n\n*   It has the correct symmetry for optical activity (allows a non-zero gyration tensor).\n*   It is achiral (contains a $\\overline{4}$ axis).\n*   It is non-polar.\n\nThe single crystal class that satisfies all the given criteria is **$\\overline{4}$**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   The primary challenge is the definition of \"optical activity\". The question's wording implies a definition beyond simple chirality, based on the non-vanishing of the gyration tensor.\n*   A crystal class is achiral if it contains any rotoinversion axis ($\\overline{n}$), not just a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n*   A non-polar class lacks any unique polar direction. The presence of a center of inversion or certain combinations of rotation axes and mirror planes ensures this.\n\nFinal Answer: The only achiral and non-polar crystal class that has the correct symmetry for optical activity is $\\overline{4}$.\n\n<<<4bar>>>"
