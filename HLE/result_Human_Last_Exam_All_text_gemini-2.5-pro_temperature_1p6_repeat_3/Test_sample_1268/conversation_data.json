    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume for squarefree natural numbers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Question and Interpretation of Terms\n\nFirst, let's understand the mathematical context and define the terms used in the question.\n\n*   **\"Squarefree natural numbers (N)\"**: This refers to positive integers $N > 1$ that are not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. In algebraic number theory, such an $N$ is used to define a **real quadratic number field**, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$. We exclude $N=1$ as it defines $\\mathbb{Q}$, not a quadratic field.\n\n*   **The Lattice and Minkowski Embedding**: The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the field $K$ can be viewed as a lattice in a real vector space via the Minkowski embedding. For a real quadratic field, there are two distinct real embeddings, $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, where $\\sigma_1(a+b\\sqrt{N}) = a+b\\sqrt{N}$ and $\\sigma_2(a+b\\sqrt{N}) = a-b\\sqrt{N}$. The Minkowski embedding maps an element $\\alpha \\in K$ to the vector $(\\sigma_1(\\alpha), \\sigma_2(\\alpha)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The set $L = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ forms a 2-dimensional lattice.\n\n*   **\"Covolume (V)\"**: The covolume of the lattice $L$ is the volume of its fundamental parallelotope. For the lattice corresponding to the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$, the covolume is given by $V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K$. The discriminant is either $N$ (if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$) or $4N$ (if $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod 4$).\n\n*   **\"Maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\"**: This notation is best interpreted in the context of the geometry of numbers.\n    *   The subscript $\\infty$ refers to the **infinity norm** (or max norm) of a vector $x = (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, defined as $||x||_\\infty = \\max(|x_1|, |x_2|)$.\n    *   The term \"maximum norm\" likely refers to this definition (the maximum of the absolute values of the components).\n    *   The overall question asks for an upper bound related to this norm. In the context of lattices, a key question is to find the length of the shortest non-zero vector. So, we interpret the question as asking for an upper bound on $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L)$, the **first successive minimum** of the lattice $L$ with respect to the infinity norm. This is defined as:\n        $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L) = \\min \\{ ||\\sigma(\\alpha)||_\\infty : \\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K, \\alpha \\neq 0 \\}$.\n\nOur goal is to find an inequality of the form $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L) \\le f(V)$ for some function $f$.\n\n### Step 2: Applying Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem\n\nThe fundamental tool for relating the covolume of a lattice to the norm of its vectors is Minkowski's First Theorem on Convex Bodies.\n\n*   **Theorem Statement**: Let $L$ be a lattice of dimension $n$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with covolume $V = \\det(L)$. Let $C$ be a convex, centrally symmetric body in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. If the volume of $C$, $\\text{Vol}(C)$, satisfies $\\text{Vol}(C) > 2^n V$, then $C$ must contain at least one lattice point from $L$ other than the origin. A slightly stronger version states that if $\\text{Vol}(C) \\ge 2^n V$, there is a non-zero point in $C$.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Upper Bound\n\nWe can use this theorem to find an upper bound for $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L)$.\n\n1.  **Choose the Convex Body**: We are interested in the infinity norm. The \"ball\" for the infinity norm is a hypercube. Let's define the convex body $C_R$ as a hypercube (a square in our $n=2$ case) of side length $2R$:\n    $C_R = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid ||x||_\\infty \\le R \\}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate its Volume**: The volume of this hypercube is $\\text{Vol}(C_R) = (2R)^n$.\n\n3.  **Apply Minkowski's Theorem**: According to the theorem, if we choose $R$ such that $(2R)^n \\ge 2^n V$, the cube $C_R$ is guaranteed to contain a non-zero lattice point $x \\in L$.\n    The condition simplifies to $R^n \\ge V$, which is equivalent to $R \\ge V^{1/n}$.\n\n4.  **Find the Bound**: This result means we can always find a non-zero lattice point $x \\in L$ such that its infinity norm $||x||_\\infty$ is less than or equal to $R = V^{1/n}$. Since $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L)$ is the minimum of these norms, it must also satisfy this bound.\n    Therefore, we have the general upper bound:\n    $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L) \\le V^{1/n}$.\n\n### Step 4: Specializing to the Case of the Question\n\nThe question concerns real quadratic fields, where the lattice is 2-dimensional ($n=2$).\n\n*   Substituting $n=2$ into our general bound, we get:\n    $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L) \\le V^{1/2} = \\sqrt{V}$.\n\nThis provides the upper bound for the maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$, interpreted as $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}$) in relation to the covolume ($V$).\n\n### Careful Point for Consideration\n\nIt is important to note a specific property of the lattices we are considering. The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ always contains the integer 1. The Minkowski embedding of 1 is $\\sigma(1) = (1,1)$. The infinity norm of this vector is $||\\sigma(1)||_\\infty = \\max(|1|, |1|) = 1$.\nSince $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L)$ is the minimum norm of any non-zero element, we must have $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(L) \\le ||\\sigma(1)||_\\infty = 1$.\nFor any real quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ (with $N>1$, squarefree), the discriminant $\\Delta_K$ is at least 5 (for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$). This means the covolume $V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|} \\ge \\sqrt{5} > 1$.\nConsequently, for the specific class of lattices considered, the constant bound of 1 is always tighter than the bound $\\sqrt{V}$.\nHowever, the question explicitly asks for a bound **\"in relation to the covolume (V)\"**. The bound $\\sqrt{V}$ is the direct answer from the general theory linking lattice norms and covolumes, and it directly involves $V$. Therefore, it is the most faithful answer to the question as phrased.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis using Minkowski's theorem, the upper bound is determined as follows:\n\nThe relationship between the minimum infinity norm of a non-zero lattice vector, $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}$, and the covolume, $V$, for an $n$-dimensional lattice is given by $\\lambda_{1, \\infty} \\le V^{1/n}$. For the 2-dimensional lattices associated with real quadratic fields, this specializes to $\\lambda_{1, \\infty} \\le V^{1/2}$."
