    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3. We are also given that their first derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are strictly positive for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. We need to find the maximum possible number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n\n2.  **Define Fixed Points:**\n    A fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. To find the number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$, we need to find the number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Degree of the Equation:**\n    Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $m$ and $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. The composite function $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $m \\times n$.\n    In this problem, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both of degree 3. Therefore, the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    The fixed-point equation is $f(g(x)) = x$, which can be written as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n    Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n4.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:**\n    According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\n    Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, it can have at most 9 real roots. This means that the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points. This gives us an upper bound of 9.\n\n5.  **Check if the Upper Bound is Achievable (The Role of the Conditions):**\n    Now we need to determine if it's possible to actually have 9 fixed points while satisfying the given conditions ($f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$).\n    *   Let's use Rolle's Theorem. If a differentiable function $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n    *   For our polynomial $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   For $P'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots, its derivative $P''(x)$ must have at least 7 distinct real roots.\n    *   Let's analyze these derivatives.\n        *   $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = h(x) - x$\n        *   $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$\n        *   $P''(x) = h''(x)$\n\n6.  **Analyze the Derivatives of h(x):**\n    *   $h'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ (by the chain rule).\n    *   $h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} h'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)]$\n        $h''(x) = [f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)] \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$\n        $h''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$\n\n7.  **Determine the Degree of h''(x):**\n    Let's find the degrees of the terms in the expression for $h''(x)$.\n    *   $f(x)$ is degree 3, so $f'(x)$ is degree 2, and $f''(x)$ is degree 1.\n    *   $g(x)$ is degree 3, so $g'(x)$ is degree 2, and $g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n    Let $f(x)=ax^3+...$ and $g(x)=px^3+...$. The conditions $f'>0, g'>0$ imply $a>0, p>0$.\n    *   Degree of $f''(g(x))$: $\\deg(f'') \\times \\deg(g) = 1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n    *   Degree of $(g'(x))^2$: $\\deg(g') \\times 2 = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   Degree of the first term $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$: $3 + 4 = 7$.\n    *   Degree of $f'(g(x))$: $\\deg(f') \\times \\deg(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   Degree of $g''(x)$: $1$.\n    *   Degree of the second term $f'(g(x))g''(x)$: $6 + 1 = 7$.\n    The leading coefficients of both terms are positive (they are derived from $a$ and $p$), so they do not cancel out. Thus, the degree of $h''(x)$ is 7.\n\n8.  **Connect the Pieces with Rolle's Theorem:**\n    *   Since $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, it can have at most 7 real roots.\n    *   This means $P''(x)$ can have at most 7 real roots.\n    *   By Rolle's theorem, if $P''(x)$ has at most 7 real roots, then $P'(x)$ can have at most $7+1=8$ real roots.\n    *   If $P'(x)$ has at most 8 real roots, then $P(x)$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots.\n\n9.  **Conclusion on Feasibility:**\n    The chain of logic is consistent. The maximum number of roots for $P(x)$ (which is 9) requires a maximum number of roots for its derivatives $P'(x)$ and $P''(x)$. The degrees of these derivatives allow for this maximum number of roots.\n    The conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ mean that $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) > 0$. For $P'(x) = h'(x)-1$ to have 8 roots, the graph of $h'(x)$ must cross the line $y=1$ eight times. Since $h'(x)$ is a degree-8 polynomial that goes to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, this is possible if its local minima are below 1 and its local maxima are above 1. The existence of many free parameters in the coefficients of the polynomials $f$ and $g$ makes it possible to construct such functions that satisfy all the conditions.\n    Thus, the upper bound of 9, derived from the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$, is achievable.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   Fixed points are solutions to $f(g(x)) = x$.\n*   This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n*   A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\n*   Analysis of the derivatives and Rolle's theorem shows no contradictions that would prevent this maximum from being achieved under the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>>9"
