    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by `(cos(9t), sin(5t))`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nThe curve is given by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nA self-intersection point is a point in the plane that the curve passes through at two or more different times `t`. Let's say `t1` and `t2` are two such distinct time values within the curve's fundamental period. A self-intersection requires:\nx(t1) = x(t2)  =>  cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)\ny(t1) = y(t2)  =>  sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the curve type and its properties**\nThis curve is a specific type of Lissajous curve. Lissajous curves are a family of curves described by parametric equations of the form:\nx(t) = A * sin(at + δ)\ny(t) = B * sin(bt)\n\nIn our case, `A=1`, `B=1`, `a=9`, `b=5`, and the `cos` function for x(t) can be written as `sin` with a phase shift `δ = π/2`:\nx(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThe shape and properties of the Lissajous curve depend on the ratio `a/b`, the amplitudes `A` and `B`, and the phase shift `δ`. The number of self-intersections is a key feature.\n\n**Step 3: Find a formula for the number of self-intersections**\nFor Lissajous curves of the form `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, there is a well-established formula for the number of self-intersection points, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nThe formula is:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\n**Step 4: Check if the conditions for the formula are met**\nThe formula is valid if `a` and `b` are coprime integers.\n1.  **Integers**: In our case, `a = 9` and `b = 5`. Both are integers.\n2.  **Coprime**: Two integers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n    gcd(9, 5) = 1.\n    Since the GCD is 1, `a` and `b` are coprime.\n\nBoth conditions are met, so we can confidently use the formula.\n\n**Careful Point**: A potential complication for such formulas is if the curve passes through the origin (0,0), as this can create a more complex singularity. Let's check for this.\nA pass through the origin requires both `x(t)=0` and `y(t)=0` for the same value of `t`.\n-   `x(t) = cos(9t) = 0` implies `9t = (k + 1/2)π` for some integer `k`.\n    `t = (2k + 1)π / 18`\n-   `y(t) = sin(5t) = 0` implies `5t = mπ` for some integer `m`.\n    `t = mπ / 5`\n\nFor a pass through the origin, we would need:\n`(2k + 1)π / 18 = mπ / 5`\n`5(2k + 1) = 18m`\nThe left side of the equation, `5(2k + 1)`, is a product of two odd numbers (5 and `2k+1`), so it must be odd.\nThe right side of the equation, `18m`, is an even number.\nAn odd number can never equal an even number. Therefore, there is no value of `t` for which the curve passes through the origin. This confirms that the standard formula can be applied without modifications.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer**\nNow, we apply the formula with `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThe curve has 16 self-intersection points."
