    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for four specific criteria to be met:\n1.  **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n2.  **Size Metric:** It must be the \"largest by displacement.\" Displacement is the weight of water a ship displaces, which is equal to the ship's own weight. It's a standard measure of a ship's size.\n3.  **Cause of Sinking:** The ship must have been sunk by a German U-boat. This can include direct attack (torpedoes) or indirect attack (mines laid by a U-boat).\n4.  **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred during World War II but *before* the Franco-German armistice, which was signed on **22 June 1940**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates\nWe need to search naval loss records for the period from September 3, 1939, to June 22, 1940. The most likely candidates will be large civilian vessels like ocean liners or tankers, as major French Navy warships were not lost to U-boats in this specific timeframe.\n\nLooking through the records of French ships sunk by U-boats during this period, two major candidates emerge based on their size:\n\n*   **The tanker *Emile Miguet***: Sunk on November 12, 1939.\n*   **The passenger liner SS *Champlain***: Sunk on June 17, 1940.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Candidates\n\n**Candidate 1: The Tanker *Emile Miguet***\n*   **Sinking Details:** On November 12, 1939, the *Emile Miguet* was hit by a torpedo from the U-boat **U-41**. The ship broke in two and sank.\n*   **Timeframe:** November 1939 is well before the June 1940 armistice.\n*   **Cause:** Sunk by a direct torpedo attack from a U-boat.\n*   **Displacement:** The *Emile Miguet* was one of the largest tankers in the world at the time. Its displacement was approximately **21,500 tons**.\n\n**Candidate 2: The Passenger Liner SS *Champlain***\n*   **Sinking Details:** On June 17, 1940, while off the coast of La Pallice, France, the *Champlain* struck a mine. The mine had been laid by the German U-boat **U-65**. The ship was crippled by the explosion and sank over the next few days.\n*   **Timeframe:** June 17, 1940, is just five days before the armistice was signed, so it falls within the required period.\n*   **Cause:** The ship was sunk by a mine laid by a U-boat. This is considered a sinking \"by a U-boat\" as the submarine was the instrument of its destruction.\n*   **Displacement:** The SS *Champlain* was a large and luxurious ocean liner. Its full load displacement was approximately **44,800 tons**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare and Conclude\nWe now compare the two leading candidates based on the question's primary metric: displacement.\n\n*   **SS *Champlain* Displacement:** ~44,800 tons\n*   ***Emile Miguet* Displacement:** ~21,500 tons\n\nThe SS *Champlain* had more than double the displacement of the *Emile Miguet*. It was a French ship, sunk within the specified timeframe, and its loss was directly caused by the action of a German U-boat. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the passenger liner **SS *Champlain***.\n\n<<<SS Champlain>>>"
