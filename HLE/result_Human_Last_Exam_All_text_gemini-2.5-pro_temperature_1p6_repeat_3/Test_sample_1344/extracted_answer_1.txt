The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst comprising:
1.  **Metal:** Zirconium (Zr), which provides a good balance of high activity for polymerization and the bond energetics required for hydrogenation and C-H activation.
2.  **Ligand:** A Constrained-Geometry Catalyst (CGC) framework, such as a substituted cyclopentadienyl-silylamido ligand. The unique, sterically open active site of this ligand class is exceptionally active for olefin polymerization while also being accessible enough to allow a polymer chain to undergo the C-H activation and β-alkyl elimination steps required for C-C bond cleavage.
3.  **Support:** For practical applications requiring a heterogenized catalyst, an inert, high-surface-area support like dehydroxylated silica or a cross-linked polymer is ideal to maintain the single-site nature of the catalyst in a processable form. For homogeneous catalysis, no support is required.
This system can be switched between polymerization (at moderate temperatures, low H₂) and efficient hydrogenolysis (at high temperatures, high H₂ pressure) modes.
