    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks for the primary molecular mechanism that explains two key outcomes after a gene duplication event in eukaryotes:\n1.  **Retention:** How are both copies of the gene kept in the genome instead of one being lost? Immediately after duplication, one copy is redundant, and without a selective advantage, it's likely to accumulate mutations and be lost (a process called nonfunctionalization or pseudogenization). So, a mechanism is needed to preserve both copies.\n2.  **Divergence:** How do the two copies become different from each other over evolutionary time? This implies they evolve to have different functions or expression patterns.\n\nThe question seeks the \"most likely\" mechanism, suggesting we should evaluate the probability and commonality of the proposed processes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice.**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"pasted over\" by the sequence of the other copy. This mechanism actually works *against* divergence by making the gene copies more similar (homogenizing them). While it is a process that affects duplicate genes, it does not explain their retention and divergence into distinct functional entities. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates inactivating mutations and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene\". This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene. However, the question asks about the retention of (presumably functional) duplicate genes that then diverge. Pseudogenization is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not retention of two functional copies. Therefore, this is incorrect in the context of the question.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy acquires a completely new, beneficial function through mutation.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies are retained by natural selection. The original copy is kept because its function is still needed, and the new copy is kept because it provides a new advantage.\n    *   **Divergence:** The new copy must change its sequence to acquire the new function, leading to divergence.\n    *   **Likelihood:** This is a valid and important mechanism. However, it relies on the relatively rare occurrence of a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation happening before the redundant copy is lost.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex regulation (e.g., expressed in different tissues). After duplication, each copy can randomly accumulate mutations that inactivate *different* subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses the ability to function in the liver but retains function in the heart, while copy 2 loses function in the heart but retains it in the liver.\n    *   **Retention:** Now, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. Losing either copy would be detrimental. This provides a strong, passive mechanism for the retention of both copies.\n    *   **Divergence:** The two copies diverge as they specialize in their remaining subfunctions and lose the others. Their regulatory elements, in particular, will diverge.\n    *   **Likelihood:** This model is considered very likely because it does not require a rare beneficial mutation. It only requires common, neutral, loss-of-function mutations to occur in different parts of the two genes, effectively partitioning the original functions and making both copies indispensable.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism. It describes the rapid diversification of a lineage into multiple species filling different ecological niches. Gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that *facilitates* adaptive radiation, but it is not the mechanism for retaining the genes themselves within a single genome. This is the wrong level of biological organization.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the most plausible options (C and D).**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the subfunctionalization model is often considered the \"most likely\" mechanism for the *initial retention* of duplicated genes. This is because it provides a pathway for preservation that relies on common, neutral mutations, rather than the rare, beneficial mutations required by neofunctionalization. By partitioning the ancestral functions, subfunctionalization \"locks in\" both copies, protecting them from being lost and giving them the evolutionary time to potentially diverge further, which could even include one copy later neofunctionalizing. Because it provides a more probable passive route to avoid the primary fate of pseudogenization, subfunctionalization is arguably the most likely mechanism responsible for the initial retention and subsequent divergence.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer determination.**\nBased on the analysis, Subfunctionalization (D) presents the most probable and common mechanism for preserving both copies of a duplicated gene from loss, thereby allowing them to be retained and to diverge over time.\n\n<<<D>>>"
