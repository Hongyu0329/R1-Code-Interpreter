    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Group G**\n    The group $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{12}$, as it acts on the set $S = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$ of 12 elements. The group is generated by three permutations:\n    *   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n    *   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n    *   $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\n2.  **Determine the properties of G**\n    *   **Parity of generators:** We check if the generators are even or odd permutations. The sign of a k-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$.\n        *   $a$ is an 11-cycle. Its sign is $(-1)^{11-1} = 1$. So, $a$ is an even permutation.\n        *   $b$ is a product of two 4-cycles. A 4-cycle is odd. The product of two odd permutations is even. So, $b$ is an even permutation.\n        *   $c$ is a product of six 2-cycles. A 2-cycle is odd. The product of six odd permutations is even. So, $c$ is an even permutation.\n        Since all generators are even permutations, the group $G$ they generate is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n    *   **Transitivity:** We check if the group G acts transitively on the set S.\n        *   The generator $a$ contains an 11-cycle that connects the 11 elements $\\{1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x\\}$.\n        *   The generator $c$ connects element 3 from this set to the element $z$ via the cycle $(3, z)$.\n        *   This means that the orbit of any element contains all 12 elements. For example, starting from 1, we can reach 3 with $a$, and then reach $z$ with $c$. Since all elements in the 11-cycle are connected, and $z$ is connected to them, the action is transitive on all 12 elements.\n\n3.  **Identify the isomorphism class of G**\n    This part requires recognizing the group from its generators and properties. This is a common feature in problems involving sporadic simple groups.\n    *   Consider the subgroup $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$. Both $a$ and $b$ fix the element $z$. Thus, $H$ is a subgroup of the stabilizer of $z$, denoted $G_z$.\n    *   The subgroup $H$ acts on the remaining 11 elements $S' = S \\setminus \\{z\\}$. On this set, $a$ is an 11-cycle, and $b$ is the product of two disjoint 4-cycles.\n    *   The action of $H$ on $S'$ is transitive because it contains an 11-cycle.\n    *   A transitive subgroup of $S_{11}$ containing an 11-cycle and an element of cycle type $4^2 \\cdot 1^3$ (like $b$) is known to be isomorphic to the Mathieu group $M_{11}$. So, $H \\cong M_{11}$.\n    *   The full group $G$ is generated by $H \\cong M_{11}$ (which fixes $z$) and the permutation $c$. The permutation $c$ is an involution that swaps $z$ with the element 3.\n    *   The Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is known to be a transitive group on 12 points, and the stabilizer of any point is a subgroup isomorphic to $M_{11}$. The structure we found ($G=\\langle M_{11}, c \\rangle$ where $M_{11}$ is a point stabilizer and $c$ is an involution moving that point) is a standard construction/characterization of $M_{12}$.\n    *   Therefore, we can conclude that the group $G$ is isomorphic to the Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n\n4.  **Find the Schur Multiplier of G**\n    The question asks for properties of the Schur multiplier of $G$, which we denote by $A$. The Schur multiplier of a group $K$ is the second homology group $H_2(K, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   Since $G \\cong M_{12}$, we need to find the Schur multiplier of $M_{12}$.\n    *   The Schur multipliers of the sporadic simple groups are well-known results in group theory. For the Mathieu groups, they are:\n        *   $M(M_{11}) = \\{1\\}$ (trivial)\n        *   $M(M_{12}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n        *   $M(M_{22}) = \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$\n        *   $M(M_{23}) = \\{1\\}$ (trivial)\n        *   $M(M_{24}) = \\{1\\}$ (trivial)\n    *   So, the Schur multiplier $A$ of $G$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n5.  **Count the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism**\n    We need to find the number of non-isomorphic proper subgroups of $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   A subgroup $K$ of $A$ is proper if $K \\neq A$.\n    *   The group $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ has order 2. By Lagrange's theorem, any subgroup must have an order that divides 2. The possible orders are 1 and 2.\n    *   The subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are:\n        1.  The subgroup of order 1: This is the trivial subgroup, containing only the identity element. Let's call it $K_1 = \\{0\\}$.\n        2.  The subgroup of order 2: This is the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ itself. Let's call it $K_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   We are looking for proper subgroups. $K_1$ is a proper subgroup since its order (1) is strictly less than the order of $A$ (2). $K_2$ is not a proper subgroup.\n    *   Thus, there is only one proper subgroup of $A$, which is the trivial subgroup $K_1$.\n    *   The question asks for the number of proper subgroups *up to isomorphism*. The subgroup $K_1$ is isomorphic to the trivial group $\\mathbb{Z}_1$. Since this is the only proper subgroup, there is only one isomorphism class for proper subgroups.\n    *   The number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n<<<1>>>"
