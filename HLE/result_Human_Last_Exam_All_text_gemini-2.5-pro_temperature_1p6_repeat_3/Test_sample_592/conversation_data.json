    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film \"Ovosodo\".\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n    *   **Movie:** Ovosodo (Hard Boiled Egg)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n    *   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n\n3.  **List Careful Points for Verification:**\n    *   **Confirm the Character's Role:** Verify that Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, is indeed the character who emigrates. In the film, Tommaso is the rebellious and adventurous best friend of the protagonist, Piero.\n    *   **Confirm the Plot Point:** Verify that moving to the US is a canonical event in the movie's plot. This is a major turning point for the character, who is fleeing trouble in his hometown of Livorno.\n    *   **Verify the Specificity:** Check if the film names a specific city or just generally refers to \"America\". The film needs to provide a concrete location for a definitive answer.\n    *   **Source Cross-Reference:** Consult multiple reliable sources (film databases, plot synopses, and detailed reviews) to ensure the accuracy of the location.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Analyze the character's arc:** Tommaso is presented as a restless character who feels constrained by his life in Livorno. After getting into significant trouble with the law, he makes the decision to flee the country rather than face the consequences.\n2.  **Identify the destination scene/mention:** His destination is not left ambiguous. The film shows the protagonist, Piero, receiving a postcard from Tommaso after he has left.\n3.  **Pinpoint the city:** The postcard sent by Tommaso is explicitly from **San Francisco**. This serves as the definitive confirmation of the US city where he has relocated.\n\nBy following these steps and verifying the plot details from reliable film summaries, we can confidently identify the correct city.\n\n<<<San Francisco>>>"
