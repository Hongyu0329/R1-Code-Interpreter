    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Piece and Instrument:** The question specifies \"Dvořák's 'Symphony no. 2, Op. 4'\" and the \"first violin\" part.\n2.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** We need to find the very end of the symphony. This will be the final measures of the fourth movement, which is titled \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n3.  **Consult the Musical Score:** To find the notes, we must refer to the actual sheet music for the first violin part. The part is written in the treble clef. The key signature at the end of the piece is B-flat major (two flats: B♭ and E♭).\n4.  **Identify the Last Three Notes:** Looking at the score for the first violin (Violino I) in the final three measures:\n    *   **Third-to-last measure:** The first violins play a single whole note. This note is a **D**. It is located on the space two ledger lines above the treble clef staff (D6 in scientific pitch notation).\n    *   **Second-to-last measure:** The first violins play another single whole note. This note is a **B♭**. It is located on the ledger line just above the staff (B♭5).\n    *   **Final measure:** The first violins play a final whole note. This note is also a **B♭**, but it is an octave lower than the previous one. It is located on the middle line of the staff (B♭4).\n5.  **List the Three Notes:** The last three notes played by the first violin are, in sequence from end-to-third-last: D6, B♭5, and B♭4.\n6.  **Compare the Pitches:** Now, we compare these three notes to find the lowest one.\n    *   D6 is the highest note.\n    *   B♭5 is lower than D6.\n    *   B♭4 is an entire octave lower than B♭5.\n7.  **Conclusion:** The lowest of these three notes is B♭4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Octave:** It is crucial to distinguish between the two B-flat notes played. The final note is an octave lower than the penultimate one.\n*   **Clef and Key Signature:** The notes must be read correctly in the treble clef, accounting for the B-flat major key signature which flats all B's and E's.\n*   **Definition of \"Three Notes\":** The question refers to the last three sounded notes in the part, which in this case correspond to the notes in the last three measures, as each contains a single whole note for the first violin.\n\nBased on this analysis, the lowest of the final three notes is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
