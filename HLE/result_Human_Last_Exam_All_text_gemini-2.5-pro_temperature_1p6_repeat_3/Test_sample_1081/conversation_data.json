    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Correspondence Principle**\n\nThe central theorem connecting the geometry of the group to combinatorics is the classification of rational maximal tori. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of maximal tori of $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Define $F$-conjugacy classes**\n\nThe Weyl group $W$ is associated with the root system of $G$. The Frobenius endomorphism $F$ induces an action on $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class in $W$ is an equivalence class under the relation $w_1 \\sim w_2$ if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$.\nTherefore, our task is to determine the number of these $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Weyl Group and the Action of Frobenius**\n\nThe group $G$ is of type $E_8$. Its associated Weyl group is denoted $W(E_8)$. To determine the number of $F$-conjugacy classes, we need to understand the action of $F$ on $W(E_8)$.\nThe action of the Frobenius map $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is determined by the action of $F$ on the root system, which in turn corresponds to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of the group.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Dynkin Diagram of $E_8$**\n\nThe Dynkin diagram for the root system of type $E_8$ is:\n```\n      o---o---o---o---o---o---o\n      |\n      o\n```\nA key property of this diagram is that it has a trivial automorphism group. That is, the only automorphism of the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram is the identity.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Action of $F$ on $W(E_8)$**\n\nSince the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram is trivial, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ must act trivially on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This holds for any form of a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, because any such group is quasi-split, and the \"twist\" is classified by the automorphisms of the diagram. With a trivial diagram automorphism group, the only possibility is the split case (or inner forms which behave similarly for this purpose).\n\n**Step 6: Simplify the Counting Problem**\n\nWith $F$ acting as the identity on $W$, the definition of an $F$-conjugacy class simplifies. The relation $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$ becomes $w_2 = x w_1 x^{-1}$. This is the definition of a standard conjugacy class in a group.\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes of $W(E_8)$**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to a known result in the theory of finite reflection groups. The order of $W(E_8)$ is $|W(E_8)| = 2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 = 696,729,600$. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed and is a standard result. This number can be found in various sources, including R. Carter's book \"Finite Groups of Lie Type: Conjugacy Classes and Complex Characters\" and computational algebra systems like GAP.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Independence from q:** The result is independent of the specific choice of the prime power $q$. This is because the Frobenius action on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is always trivial, regardless of the field.\n2.  **Role of Dynkin Diagram Symmetry:** The triviality of the automorphism group of the $E_8$ diagram is the crucial simplification. For other types like $A_n$ ($n>1$), $D_n$ ($n>4$), or $E_6$, there are non-trivial diagram automorphisms. For these groups, one has to consider non-split forms (e.g., unitary groups) where $F$ acts non-trivially on $W$, and the number of $F$-conjugacy classes can be different from the number of ordinary conjugacy classes.\n3.  **Correctness of the Correspondence:** The one-to-one correspondence is a deep and fundamental theorem. We rely on its validity.\n4.  **Source for the Number of Classes:** The final number, 112, is taken from established mathematical literature and is a result of a non-trivial computation, first established by Frame and others.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This number is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
