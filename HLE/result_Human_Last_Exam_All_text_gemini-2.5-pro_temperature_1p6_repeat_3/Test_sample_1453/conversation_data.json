    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Coiled-Coils and the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as **(abcdefg)n**.\n\n*   The positions **'a'** and **'d'** are the most critical. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic (nonpolar) amino acids. These residues form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil, packing against each other and driving the assembly of the helices.\n*   The positions **'e'** and **'g'** are located on the edges of the hydrophobic core. They are often charged or polar and can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n*   The positions **'b'**, **'c'**, and **'f'** are solvent-exposed and are usually occupied by polar or charged residues.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to assign the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions. The key is to find a repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues consistently fall at the 'a' and 'd' positions. Let's look for the most prominent hydrophobic residues: Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W).\n\n*   Isoleucines (I) are at positions 3, 10, 17, 24. Notice the spacing is exactly 7 amino acids (10-3=7, 17-10=7, 24-17=7). This strongly suggests they occupy the same position in the heptad repeat.\n*   Leucines (L) are at positions 7, 14, 21, 28. This also shows a perfect spacing of 7.\n\nNow we need to figure out which is 'a' and which is 'd'. The 'a' and 'd' positions are separated by two residues in the sequence (e.g., a-b-c-d). This means their positions in the sequence are `i` and `i+3`. The next 'a' position is at `i+7`.\nLet's test the spacing between our `I` and `L` residues.\n*   The first `I` is at position 3, and the first `L` is at position 7. The spacing is 4 residues (7-3=4).\n*   In a heptad repeat, the `d` position is followed by the next `a` position with a spacing of 3 residues (d-e-f-g-a). So their indices would be `i` and `i+4`.\n\nThis perfectly matches our observation. The `I` residues are at the **'d'** position, and the `L` residues are at the **'a'** position.\n\nLet's confirm the assignment for the whole sequence:\n*   Sequence:  `G E I A Q S L | K E I A K S L | K E I A W S L | K E I A Q S L | K G`\n*   Heptad:    `b c d e f g a | b c d e f g a | b c d e f g a | b c d e f g a | b c`\n\nSummary of residues at each position (ignoring terminal caps):\n*   **'a' positions:** L, L, L, L (all Leucine)\n*   **'d' positions:** I, I, I, I (all Isoleucine)\n*   **'e' and 'g' positions:** A, W, Q, S, K (mostly polar/flanking residues)\n\nSo, the core of this coiled-coil is defined by having **Leucine (L) at the 'a' position** and **Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position**.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles to Determine Oligomeric State**\n\nThe specific identity and shape of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions determine how many helices can efficiently pack together. This is governed by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing model. The side chain of one helix (the knob) fits into a space created by side chains on the adjacent helix (the hole). The geometry must be favorable.\n\nA key factor is whether the amino acid is branched at its β-carbon (the second carbon of the side chain).\n*   **Leucine (L):** Not β-branched. The side chain is `–CH2–CH(CH3)2`. It's relatively flexible.\n*   **Isoleucine (I):** β-branched. The side chain is `–CH(CH3)CH2CH3`. It's bulkier and more constrained near the protein backbone.\n\nExtensive experimental studies have established strong correlations between the core residues and the oligomeric state:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by non-β-branched residues. The classic pattern is `a=L, d=L`. The helices cross at a slight angle, and the flexible leucine side chains pack well. `a=I, d=I` also forms dimers.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by having a β-branched residue (I or V) at the 'a' position and a non-β-branched residue (L) at the 'd' position (`a=I, d=L`). The packing is more perpendicular, and this arrangement best accommodates the shapes.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Strongly favored by the opposite pattern: a non-β-branched residue (L) at the **'a' position** and a β-branched residue (I or V) at the **'d' position** (`a=L, d=I`). The bulky isoleucine at the 'd' position causes steric clashes in a dimer or trimer arrangement but can be perfectly accommodated in a four-helix bundle where the helices are almost parallel.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Oligomeric State**\n\nOur analysis of the sequence showed:\n*   **'a' position = Leucine (L)** (non-β-branched)\n*   **'d' position = Isoleucine (I)** (β-branched)\n\nThis `a=L, d=I` pattern is the canonical signature for a **tetrameric (4-stranded)** coiled-coil.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Sequence pattern is clearly a heptad repeat. (Check)\n*   Core positions are consistently `a=L` and `d=I`. (Check)\n*   Packing rules for `a=L, d=I` predict a tetramer. (Check)\n*   The answer choices include 4. (Check)\n\nThe predicted oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
