    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to an amide group (-CONH2).\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: The nitrogen atom of the amide group is attached to two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The amide group is -CON(C2H5)2.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is attached to the benzene ring at the C3 position (meta position relative to the amide group).\n\nThe structure is as follows, with the amide group defining the C1 position of the benzene ring:\n```\n      O\n      //\n     C-N(C2H5)2\n    /\n (1)C---C(2)H\n //  \\\\\nHC(6)  C(3)-N(CH3)2\n \\\\  //\n  C(5)H--C(4)H\n```\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step**\n\nThe reagents for the first step are **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium)**, **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)**, and **THF (tetrahydrofuran)** as the solvent.\n\n*   **sec-BuLi** is a very strong organolithium base. Its primary role in this context is to deprotonate an acidic C-H bond on the aromatic ring, a process known as lithiation or metalation.\n*   **TMEDA** is a bidentate chelating ligand for lithium ions. It breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, increasing its basicity and reactivity. It also plays a crucial role in directing the lithiation.\n*   This reaction is a classic example of **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. In a DoM reaction, a functional group on the aromatic ring, called a Directing Metalation Group (DMG), coordinates to the lithium ion and directs the base to deprotonate a proton at the ortho position.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The starting material has two potential Directing Metalation Groups (DMGs):\n    1.  The **N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt2)** at C1.\n    2.  The **dimethylamino group (-NMe2)** at C3.\n*   It is crucial to compare the directing ability of these two groups. The amide group (-CONR2) is one of the most powerful DMGs known, significantly stronger than the amino group (-NR2). This is due to the strong coordination of the amide's carbonyl oxygen with the lithium ion.\n*   Since the amide group is the stronger director, the lithiation will occur at a position ortho to it. The positions ortho to the amide group are C2 and C6.\n*   Now, we must consider the influence of the weaker directing dimethylamino group at C3. This group also directs lithiation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n*   Comparing the potential sites:\n    *   **C2 Position**: This position is *ortho* to the powerful amide director AND *ortho* to the secondary amino director. The two groups work together in a synergistic fashion, making the C2 proton exceptionally acidic and the deprotonation at this site highly favorable. The resulting lithiated intermediate is stabilized by chelation of the lithium ion with both the amide oxygen and the amino nitrogen, forming a stable five-membered ring.\n    *   **C6 Position**: This position is *ortho* to the amide director but *meta* to the amino director.\n*   Due to the cooperative directing effect, deprotonation occurs almost exclusively at the **C2 position**.\n\nThe product of the first step is the aryllithium intermediate: **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step**\n\nThe second reagent added is **methyl iodide (CH3I)**.\n\n*   The aryllithium species formed in step 1 is a powerful nucleophile (essentially an aryl carbanion).\n*   Methyl iodide is an electrophile.\n*   The reaction is a nucleophilic attack of the carbanion at C2 onto the electrophilic methyl carbon of methyl iodide. This is a standard quenching reaction for organolithium reagents.\n\n**Careful Point:**\n*   The nucleophilic C2-Li bond attacks the CH3 group, forming a new C2-CH3 bond and displacing iodide (I-) as the leaving group.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction replaces the lithium atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n\n*   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, the reaction introduces a methyl group at the C2 position.\n*   The final product is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\nThe structure of the final compound is:\n```\n      O\n      //\n     C-N(C2H5)2\n    /\n (1)C---C(2)-CH3\n //  \\\\\nHC(6)  C(3)-N(CH3)2\n \\\\  //\n  C(5)H--C(4)H\n```\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
