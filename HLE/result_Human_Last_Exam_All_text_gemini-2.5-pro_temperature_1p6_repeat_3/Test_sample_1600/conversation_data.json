    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the value of a(3).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions in the question**\n\n*   **Feynman diagrams:** These are pictorial representations of the mathematical expressions describing the interactions of subatomic particles in quantum field theory.\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force, describing how light (photons) and matter (like electrons) interact.\n*   **Propagators:** In QFT, a propagator represents the contribution of a virtual particle to a process. An \"electron propagator\" or \"photon propagator\" refers to a diagram with two external lines of the same type (two external electron lines or two external photon lines, respectively). These diagrams are also known as self-energy diagrams.\n*   **Order 2n:** The order of a Feynman diagram in QED corresponds to the number of interaction vertices in the diagram. Each vertex involves one electron line coming in, one electron line going out, and one photon line. The contribution of each vertex to the overall amplitude is proportional to the elementary charge `e`. An entire diagram's contribution is proportional to `e^V` where `V` is the number of vertices. Thus, \"order 2n\" means the diagram has `V = 2n` vertices.\n*   **Non-vanishing Feynman diagrams:** This refers to diagrams that give a non-zero contribution. In QED, due to a principle called Furry's theorem, any connected diagram with an odd number of vertices evaluates to zero. This is why the order is specified as `2n`, ensuring an even number of vertices. We are also implicitly counting only connected, one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams, which are the fundamental building blocks for propagator corrections.\n*   **a(n):** This is the function that gives the number of such diagrams for a given `n`. The question states that `a(n)` is the number for *either* the electron or the photon propagator. This is because the number of topologically distinct diagrams turns out to be the same for both cases at any given order.\n\n**Step 2: Find the formula for a(n)**\n\nThis is a well-known combinatorial problem in quantum field theory. The number of topologically distinct, connected, 1PI Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon self-energy at order `2n` (i.e., with `2n` vertices) is given by the double factorial of `2n-1`.\n\nThe formula is:\n`a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`\n\nWhere the double factorial `k!!` is the product of all integers from `k` down to 1 with the same parity (odd or even) as `k`. Since `2n-1` is always odd, this means:\n`(2n - 1)!! = (2n - 1) * (2n - 3) * (2n - 5) * ... * 3 * 1`\n\n**Step 3: Verify the formula for small values of n**\n\n*   **For n = 1 (Order 2):**\n    `a(1) = (2*1 - 1)!! = 1!! = 1`\n    This is correct. At order 2 (2 vertices), there is only one 1PI diagram for the electron self-energy (an electron emitting and reabsorbing a photon) and one for the photon self-energy (a photon creating an electron-positron pair which then annihilates).\n\n*   **For n = 2 (Order 4):**\n    `a(2) = (2*2 - 1)!! = 3!! = 3 * 1 = 3`\n    This is also correct. At order 4 (4 vertices), it can be shown that there are exactly 3 distinct 1PI diagrams for each propagator type.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate a(3)**\n\nThe question asks for `a(3)`, which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order `2 * 3 = 6`.\n\nUsing the formula:\n`a(3) = (2*3 - 1)!!`\n`a(3) = (6 - 1)!!`\n`a(3) = 5!!`\n\nNow, we calculate the double factorial `5!!`:\n`5!! = 5 * 3 * 1`\n`5!! = 15`\n\nThus, there are 15 distinct non-vanishing 1PI Feynman diagrams of order 6 for the electron or photon propagators.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n1.  **Order vs. n:** The order is `2n`, not `n`. The question asks for `a(3)`, so we must set `n=3`, which corresponds to diagrams of order `2*3 = 6`.\n2.  **Double Factorial:** Be careful not to confuse the double factorial `k!!` with `(k!)!`. `5!! = 15`, whereas `(5!)! = 120!`, which is a vastly different number.\n3.  **Electron or Photon:** The problem states \"electron or photon\" because the number of distinct diagram topologies is the same in both cases, even though the lines in the diagrams represent different particles.\n4.  **Non-vanishing/1PI:** The problem implicitly assumes we are counting connected, 1PI diagrams, which is standard for self-energy calculations. These are the diagrams that cannot be split into two separate parts by cutting a single internal line.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n\nThe number of diagrams `a(n)` of order `2n` is given by `a(n) = (2n-1)!!`.\nWe need to find `a(3)`.\nSubstitute `n = 3` into the formula:\n`a(3) = (2 * 3 - 1)!! = 5!!`\n`a(3) = 5 * 3 * 1 = 15`\n\n<<<15>>>"
