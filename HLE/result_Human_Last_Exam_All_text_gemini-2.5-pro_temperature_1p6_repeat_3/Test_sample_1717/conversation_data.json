    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:** First, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, the Eye of Cthulhu has **3,640 HP** in single-player Expert Mode.\n\n2.  **Determine the Health Scaling Formula:** In Terraria, the health of bosses increases in multiplayer. The formula for health scaling in Expert Mode is as follows:\n    *   `Total Health = Base Health * (1 + 0.35 * (Number of Players - 1))`\n    *   The formula shows that for each player after the first one, the boss's health is increased by a factor of 0.35 (or 35%) of its base health.\n\n3.  **Apply the Condition of \"Infinite Players\":** The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. Let's analyze the formula as the number of players (let's call it `N`) approaches infinity (`N → ∞`).\n    *   `Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n    *   As `N` becomes infinitely large, the term `(N - 1)` also becomes infinitely large.\n    *   This means the entire scaling multiplier `(1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))` approaches infinity.\n    *   Mathematically, plugging infinity into the formula results in an infinite amount of health.\n\n4.  **Consider Technical Limitations of the Game Engine:** While the mathematical formula suggests infinite health, we must consider the technical constraints of the game's source code. A video game cannot store an infinitely large number. Values like health are stored in specific data types with fixed limits.\n    *   In Terraria's source code (written in C#), an NPC's health is stored in a 32-bit signed integer variable (an `int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. This value is `2^31 - 1`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Maximum Value:** The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is:\n    *   `2,147,483,647`\n    *   This is the absolute highest number that the game can use to represent an NPC's health. Any calculation that results in a higher value would be capped at this limit (or cause an overflow, which in practice is often handled by clamping to the maximum value).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Theoretical vs. Practical:** The question is theoretical (\"infinite players\"), so we ignore practical limits like the maximum number of players a server can host (which is 255).\n*   **The Scaling Formula:** It is crucial to use the correct scaling formula for Expert Mode (a 35% increase per player), which is different from Normal Mode (no scaling) and Master Mode (a 50% increase per player).\n*   **The Limiting Factor:** The key to this problem is realizing that the limiting factor isn't the formula itself, but the data type used to store the result in the game's code.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nGiven an infinite number of players, the health calculation would exceed any finite number. However, the game engine's use of a 32-bit signed integer for health imposes a hard cap. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have is the maximum value of this data type.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
