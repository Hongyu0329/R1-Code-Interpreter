    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Simple Graph**: An undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices**: The graph has a set of V with |V| = 5.\n*   **Non-isomorphic**: We count graph structures, meaning we don't distinguish between graphs that can be made identical by just relabeling the vertices.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (Biconnected)**: A connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph has no **cut vertices** (also known as articulation points).\n\n### Step 2: Establish Necessary Conditions for 2-Vertex-Connectivity\n\nA fundamental theorem in graph theory states that for any graph G, its vertex connectivity κ(G) is less than or equal to its minimum vertex degree δ(G).\n*   Vertex Connectivity κ(G): The minimum number of vertices that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.\n*   Minimum Degree δ(G): The smallest degree of any vertex in the graph.\n\nFor a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, we must have κ(G) ≥ 2.\nFrom the theorem κ(G) ≤ δ(G), it follows that we must have δ(G) ≥ 2.\nThis provides a crucial filter: we only need to consider graphs where every vertex has a degree of at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate by the Number of Edges (m)\n\nLet n=5 be the number of vertices. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10.\nThe condition δ(G) ≥ 2 implies that the sum of all vertex degrees must be at least n * δ(G) = 5 * 2 = 10.\nBy the handshaking lemma, the sum of degrees is 2m (twice the number of edges).\nSo, 2m ≥ 10, which means m ≥ 5.\n\nWe will now check all possible numbers of edges from m=5 to m=10.\n\n**Case m = 5:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 2 * 5 = 10.\n*   Given δ(G) ≥ 2, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   The unique non-isomorphic graph with this degree sequence is the 5-cycle graph, **C5**.\n*   A cycle graph Cn (for n ≥ 3) is always 2-vertex-connected because removing any single vertex results in a path, which is connected.\n*   **Count: 1 graph**\n\n**Case m = 6:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 12. We look for graphs with δ(G) ≥ 2.\n*   One such graph is **C5 with one chord**. We start with the 2-connected graph C5 and add an edge. Adding edges cannot reduce vertex connectivity, so the result is 2-connected. This graph contains triangles (C3).\n*   Another such graph is the **complete bipartite graph K2,3**. This graph is 2-connected because removing any vertex leaves the graph connected. It is bipartite and contains no triangles.\n*   Since one graph has triangles and the other does not, they are non-isomorphic. Any other connected graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges either has a vertex of degree 1 or contains a cut vertex (e.g., two triangles sharing a single vertex).\n*   **Count: 2 graphs**\n\n**Case m = 7:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 14. It is easier to analyze the complement graph (G'), which has C(5,2) - 7 = 3 edges. There are three non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges (a path P4, a star K1,3, and a path P3 with an isolated edge K2).\n    1.  If G' is a star (K1,3), then in G, the vertex corresponding to the center of the star has a degree of 1. So G cannot be 2-connected.\n    2.  If G' is a path P4, then G = **K5 - P4**. This graph has δ(G)=2 and is 2-connected.\n    3.  If G' is a P3 U K2 (a path on 3 vertices and a separate edge), then G = **K5 - (P3 U K2)**. This graph also has δ(G)=2 and is 2-connected.\n*   These two graphs have different degree sequences, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*   **Count: 2 graphs**\n\n**Case m = 8:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 16. The complement graph G' has C(5,2) - 8 = 2 edges. There are two non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges.\n    1.  If G' is two disjoint edges (2K2), then G = **K5 - 2K2**. This is the wheel graph **W5** (a central vertex connected to a C4 cycle). The connectivity of W5 is 3, so it is 2-connected.\n    2.  If G' is a path on 3 vertices (P3), then G = **K5 - P3**. This graph can be shown to be 2-connected.\n*   These two graphs have different degree sequences, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*   **Count: 2 graphs**\n\n**Case m = 9:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 18. The complement G' has C(5,2) - 9 = 1 edge.\n*   The graph is **K5 with one edge removed (K5 - e)**. The connectivity of Kn - e is n-2. For n=5, the connectivity is 3. Thus, it is 2-connected.\n*   **Count: 1 graph**\n\n**Case m = 10:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 20. The only graph is the **complete graph K5**.\n*   The connectivity of Kn is n-1. For K5, κ(K5)=4. It is 2-connected.\n*   **Count: 1 graph**\n\n### Final Tally\n\nSumming the number of graphs found for each possible number of edges:\n*   m = 5: 1 graph (C5)\n*   m = 6: 2 graphs (C5+chord, K2,3)\n*   m = 7: 2 graphs\n*   m = 8: 2 graphs\n*   m = 9: 1 graph (K5-e)\n*   m = 10: 1 graph (K5)\n\nTotal number of graphs = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
