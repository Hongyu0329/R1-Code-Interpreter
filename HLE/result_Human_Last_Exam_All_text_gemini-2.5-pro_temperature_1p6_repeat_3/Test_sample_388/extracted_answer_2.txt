The pharmacist should counsel Allison that her headache sounds like a migraine and advise her to follow up with her doctor. It is critical to determine if she has migraines with aura (headaches with preceding visual or sensory disturbances), as taking an estrogen-containing contraceptive like Junel Fe can significantly increase the risk of stroke in those patients. She should also be cautioned about the regular use of Excedrin due to an increased bleeding risk when combined with her Fluoxetine.
