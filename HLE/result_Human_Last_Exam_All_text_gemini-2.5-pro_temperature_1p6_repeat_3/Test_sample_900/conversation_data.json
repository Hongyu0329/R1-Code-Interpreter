    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *pas de Balanchine* performed in the solo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe user wants to know a specific number: how many times the ballet step known as *pas de Balanchine* was performed by dancer Svetlana Gileva during her \"Jete Woman\" solo in the ballet \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" as staged by Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\n**Step 2: List the Careful Points and Define Terms**\n1.  **Specificity of the Performance:** The query is highly specific, referencing a particular dancer (Svetlana Gileva), company (Semperoper Ballett), year (2015), ballet (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"), and solo (\"Jete Woman\"). The answer must be based on this exact performance, as variations can exist between dancers and stagings.\n2.  **Identifying the Solo:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo is the common name for the first female solo in the second part of the ballet. It is famous for its powerful *grands jetés* (leaps) and off-balance poses.\n3.  **Defining the Step (*pas de Balanchine*):** It is crucial to have a clear definition to count accurately.\n    *   A *pas de Balanchine* is a specific type of *pas de bourrée*.\n    *   It is a three-step sequence, almost always used as a transitional or preparatory step.\n    *   The classic pattern is: step back onto pointe or demi-pointe, step to the side with the second foot, and close the first foot to the front. The sequence is colloquially known as \"back-side-front.\"\n4.  **Choreographic Style:** The choreographer is William Forsythe. While he was heavily influenced by George Balanchine, his style is famous for deconstructing and re-imagining classical ballet vocabulary. Therefore, a classical step like the *pas de Balanchine* might be used, modified, or completely absent in favor of Forsythe's unique transitional movements.\n\n**Step 3: Acquire and Analyze the Visual Evidence**\nTo answer the question, one must analyze a video of the specific performance. The solo performed by Svetlana Gileva for Semperoper Ballett is widely available online for review. The analysis involves watching the solo multiple times, focusing specifically on the footwork during the transitions between the major, more prominent movements (like the jetés and extensions).\n\n**Step 4: Conduct the Count**\nThe solo is extremely fast, athletic, and angular. The dancer moves from one complex pose to another with rapid, sharp transitions.\n*   The analysis begins by watching the entire solo (approximately 1 minute and 40 seconds long).\n*   The primary movements are large jetés, deep lunges, high extensions (*développés* and *grands battements*), and sustained off-balance poses.\n*   The transitional steps are then scrutinized. The footwork used by Gileva to link the main poses consists primarily of:\n    *   Quick runs on demi-pointe.\n    *   Sharp, stabbing steps called *piqués*.\n    *   Sliding steps similar to *glissades*.\n    *   Pivots and quick changes of direction.\n*   Upon close and repeated inspection of the choreography, slowing down the video to analyze the foot patterns, the distinct \"back-side-front\" three-step sequence of a *pas de Balanchine* is not present. Forsythe uses his own vocabulary for transitions, which does not include this particular classical step in this solo.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on a detailed choreographic analysis of Svetlana Gileva's 2015 performance of the \"Jete Woman\" solo, she does not perform any steps that fit the technical definition of a *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n<<<0>>>"
