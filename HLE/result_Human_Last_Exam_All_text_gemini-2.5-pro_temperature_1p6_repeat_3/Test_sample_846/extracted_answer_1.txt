At sunrise, when exposed to the UV light in sunlight, the picnic table must change its shape from a long, relatively straight form (the stable *trans* isomer) to a bent, V-shape (the less stable *cis* isomer). Then, after sunset, in the dark, it must slowly relax and return to its original straight form, mimicking the thermal relaxation of the *cis* isomer back to the *trans* isomer.
