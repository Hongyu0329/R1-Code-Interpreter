    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and the Pieces\n\n*   **Chessboard:** An 8x8 grid of 64 squares.\n*   **Edge Squares:** These are the squares on the outermost perimeter of the board. An 8x8 board has 4 sides of 8 squares each. However, the 4 corner squares are counted in two sides. So, the total number of edge squares is (8 Ã— 4) - 4 = 28.\n*   **Bishops:** Bishops move any number of squares diagonally. A key property is that a bishop placed on a light-colored square can only ever attack other light-colored squares. Similarly, a bishop on a dark-colored square can only attack other dark-colored squares.\n*   **The Goal:** The goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 edge squares. The standard interpretation for this type of chess puzzle is that no two bishops can attack each other.\n\n### Step 2: Separate the Problem by Color\n\nBecause bishops on white squares cannot attack bishops on dark squares, we can solve the problem for each color independently and then combine the results.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of white and dark edge squares.\n*   The top and bottom rows (ranks 1 and 8) each have 4 white and 4 dark squares.\n*   The left and right columns (files 'a' and 'h'), excluding the corners which are already counted, have 6 squares each. On file 'a', squares a2, a4, a6 are white, and a3, a5, a7 are dark. On file 'h', squares h3, h5, h7 are white, and h2, h4, h6 are dark.\n*   Total White Edge Squares: 4 (rank 1) + 4 (rank 8) + 3 (file a) + 3 (file h) = 14.\n*   Total Dark Edge Squares: 4 (rank 1) + 4 (rank 8) + 3 (file a) + 3 (file h) = 14.\n*   Check: 14 + 14 = 28, which is the total number of edge squares.\n\nSo, the problem is now twofold:\n1.  What is the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares?\n2.  What is the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 dark edge squares?\n\n### Step 3: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares\n\nThere are 14 white edge squares. Let's find a placement. A good strategy is to fill one side first.\n*   Let's try to place bishops on all the white squares of file 'a': **a2, a4, a6, a8**. These four bishops do not attack each other.\n*   Now, let's see which other white edge squares are attacked by this placement:\n    *   Bishop on a2 attacks b1 and g8.\n    *   Bishop on a4 attacks d1 and e8.\n    *   Bishop on a6 attacks f1 and c8.\n    *   Bishop on a8 attacks h1.\n*   The placed bishops and the squares they attack are: {a2, a4, a6, a8, b1, g8, d1, e8, f1, c8, h1}.\n*   The original 14 white edge squares are: {a2, a4, a6, a8, b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8, h3, h5, h7}.\n*   The white edge squares that are NOT occupied and NOT attacked are: **h3, h5, h7**.\n*   These three squares (h3, h5, h7) do not attack each other. They also do not attack the bishops we already placed on file 'a'.\n*   So, we can add bishops on h3, h5, and h7.\n*   Our final set of placed bishops is {a2, a4, a6, a8, h3, h5, h7}. This is a total of **7** bishops. Since every white edge square is now either occupied or attacked, we cannot place any more. Thus, 7 is the maximum.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize Bishops on Dark Edge Squares\n\nThe arrangement of dark edge squares is symmetrical to the white ones. We can apply the same logic.\n*   There are 14 dark edge squares.\n*   By symmetry, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on them is also **7**.\n*   A valid placement would be {h2, h4, h6, h8, a3, a5, a7}. This is a mirror image of the white square placement and is also valid.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\n*   Maximum bishops that can be placed on white edge squares = 7.\n*   Maximum bishops that can be placed on dark edge squares = 7.\n*   Total maximum bishops that can be placed on all edge squares = 7 + 7 = **14**.\n*   The question asks for the number of edge squares that **lack** bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Number of squares with bishops = 14.\n*   Number of squares lacking bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n1.  **Read the Question Carefully:** The question asks for the number of empty squares, not the number of placed bishops.\n2.  **Assume Non-Attacking:** The phrase \"placing as many ... as possible\" implies the standard chess puzzle constraint that pieces of the same type cannot attack one another.\n3.  **Use Bishop's Color-Bound Nature:** This is the key insight that simplifies the problem into two smaller, independent parts.\n4.  **Systematic Placement:** When finding the maximum number of bishops, a systematic approach (like filling one side first) is more reliable than random guessing.\n5.  **Symmetry:** Recognizing the board's symmetry allows you to solve the problem for the second color instantly after solving it for the first.\n\n<<<14>>>"
