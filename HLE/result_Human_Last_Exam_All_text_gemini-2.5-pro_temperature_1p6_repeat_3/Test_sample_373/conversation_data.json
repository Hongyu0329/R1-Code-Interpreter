    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\n\n*   **Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge, called a bridge or a bottleneck edge.\n*   **10 Nodes:** The total number of nodes (vertices) in our graph is N = 10.\n*   **Structure:** To have two identical cliques, we must divide the 10 nodes into two groups of 5. Therefore, the graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (K5), connected by a single edge.\n*   **Cliques and Bottleneck:** Let's call the two cliques C1 and C2.\n    *   C1 contains 5 nodes. In a complete graph, every node is connected to every other node.\n    *   C2 contains 5 nodes, similarly connected.\n    *   The **bottleneck edge** is a single edge that connects one node from C1 to one node from C2. Let's call the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge `n1` (from C1) and `n2` (from C2).\n*   **Uniform Weights:** All edges have the same weight, so we can treat this as an unweighted graph.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Degree of Each Node\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need to calculate this for every node in the graph.\n\n*   **Nodes within a clique (not on the bottleneck):**\n    *   Consider a node in C1 that is *not* `n1`. It is part of a K5 clique. It is connected to the other 4 nodes in C1.\n    *   Its degree is `5 - 1 = 4`.\n    *   There are 4 such nodes in C1 and 4 such nodes in C2, for a total of **8 nodes with degree 4**.\n*   **Nodes on the bottleneck edge (`n1` and `n2`):**\n    *   Consider node `n1` in C1. It is connected to the other 4 nodes within its own clique (C1).\n    *   It is also connected to node `n2` via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, its degree is `(5 - 1) + 1 = 5`.\n    *   The same logic applies to node `n2`.\n    *   There are **2 nodes with degree 5**.\n\n### Step 3: Model the Sampling Process\n\n*   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** This process describes how information spreads in a network. For our problem, \"sampling an edge\" via this process can be modeled as a single gossip step.\n*   The standard model for a single step of \"randomized uniform gossiping\" is a two-stage process:\n    1.  A starting node, `u`, is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all N nodes. The probability of choosing any specific node is `1/N`.\n    2.  The chosen node `u` then selects one of its neighbors, `v`, uniformly at random. The probability of selecting a specific neighbor is `1/degree(u)`.\n*   The \"sampled edge\" is the edge `(u, v)`. We want to find the probability that this edge is the single bottleneck edge in the graph.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe bottleneck edge `(n1, n2)` can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  Node `n1` is chosen as the starting node, and it selects `n2` as its neighbor.\n2.  Node `n2` is chosen as the starting node, and it selects `n1` as its neighbor.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each case.\n\n*   **Case 1: Sampling `(n1, n2)`**\n    *   The probability of choosing `n1` as the starting node is `P(u=n1) = 1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   Given that `n1` was chosen, the probability of it selecting neighbor `n2` is `P(v=n2 | u=n1) = 1 / degree(n1)`. From Step 2, we know `degree(n1) = 5`. So, this probability is `1/5`.\n    *   The total probability of this case is `P(u=n1) * P(v=n2 | u=n1) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Case 2: Sampling `(n2, n1)`**\n    *   The probability of choosing `n2` as the starting node is `P(u=n2) = 1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   Given that `n2` was chosen, the probability of it selecting neighbor `n1` is `P(v=n1 | u=n2) = 1 / degree(n2)`. We know `degree(n2) = 5`. So, this probability is `1/5`.\n    *   The total probability of this case is `P(u=n2) * P(v=n1 | u=n2) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   The overall probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases.\n    *   Total Probability = `P(Case 1) + P(Case 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`.\n    *   Simplifying the fraction gives `1/25`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final probability is `1/25`, which can also be expressed as the decimal `0.04`.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
