    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system.\n\n**The System:**\nx(k+1) = A * x(k)\ny(k) = C * x(k)\nwith:\nA = [[1, 1, 0],\n     [2, 1, 1],\n     [0, 2, 0]]\n\nC = [[0, 1, 0],  (let's call its rows c1 and c2)\n     [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe problem asks to find the new matrix C (let's call it C_o) in the observer canonical form. The phrase \"using duality\" suggests that the concepts of controllability are mirrored in observability. We can find the observer canonical form directly by finding the observability indices and constructing the appropriate state transformation.\n\n**Step 1: Check Observability and Find Observability Indices**\nFirst, we need to ensure the system is observable. The observability matrix is given by:\nW_o = [C^T, A^T*C^T, (A^T)^2*C^T]^T which can be written as:\nW_o = [C; C*A; C*A^2]\n\nLet's compute the necessary components:\nc1 = [0, 1, 0]\nc2 = [1, 1, 0]\n\nC*A = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\n    = [[0*1+1*2+0*0, 0*1+1*1+0*2, 0*0+1*1+0*0],\n       [1*1+1*2+0*0, 1*1+1*1+0*2, 1*0+1*1+0*0]]\n    = [[2, 1, 1],  (c1*A)\n       [3, 2, 1]]  (c2*A)\n\nThe observability matrix begins with the rows of C, then the rows of C*A, and so on.\nW_o = [[0, 1, 0],   (c1)\n       [1, 1, 0],   (c2)\n       [2, 1, 1],   (c1*A)\n       [3, 2, 1]]   (c2*A)\n       ...\n\nTo check for observability, we need to find the rank of W_o. We only need to check the first `n`=3 independent rows. Let's take the first three rows:\n[[0, 1, 0],\n [1, 1, 0],\n [2, 1, 1]]\nThe determinant is 0*(1-0) - 1*(1-0) + 0*(...) = -1. Since the determinant is non-zero, the matrix has rank 3, and the system is observable.\n\nNext, we find the observability indices (nu_1, nu_2), which tell us how many state derivatives are needed for each output to determine the state. We select linearly independent rows from W_o in order (c1, c2, c1*A, c2*A, ...).\n1.  **c1** = [0, 1, 0]. This is our first vector.\n2.  **c2** = [1, 1, 0]. Is it linearly independent of {c1}? Yes. This is our second vector.\n3.  **c1*A** = [2, 1, 1]. Is it linearly independent of {c1, c2}? Yes, because the third component is non-zero, while it is zero for c1 and c2. This is our third vector.\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors: {c1, c2, c1*A}. The search stops.\nThe index `nu_1` (for output 1) is 2 because we used `c1` and `c1*A`.\nThe index `nu_2` (for output 2) is 1 because we used `c2`.\nCheck: nu_1 + nu_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 = n (the state dimension).\n\n**Step 2: Construct the Transformation Matrix**\nThe transformation matrix, let's call it T, that transforms the state `x` to the canonical state `z` (z = Tx) is constructed using the linearly independent row vectors we found, in the correct order:\nT = [[c1],\n     [c1*A],\n     [c2]]\nT = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [2, 1, 1],\n     [1, 1, 0]]\n\n**Step 3: Invert the Transformation Matrix**\nTo find the new matrices A_o and C_o, we need the inverse of T.\nz(k+1) = T*x(k+1) = T*A*x(k) = T*A*(T^-1*z(k)) => A_o = T*A*T^-1\ny(k) = C*x(k) = C*(T^-1*z(k)) => C_o = C*T^-1\n\nFirst, find the determinant of T:\ndet(T) = 0 * det([[1,1],[1,0]]) - 1 * det([[2,1],[1,0]]) + 0 * det([[2,1],[1,1]])\n       = -1 * (2*0 - 1*1) = 1\n\nNext, find the adjugate of T (the transpose of the cofactor matrix):\nCofactor(T) = [[-1, 1, 1],\n               [ 0, 0, 1],\n               [ 1, 0, -2]]\nAdj(T) = Cofactor(T)^T = [[-1, 0, 1],\n                            [ 1, 0, 0],\n                            [ 1, 1, -2]]\nSince det(T)=1, the inverse is equal to the adjugate:\nT^-1 = [[-1, 0, 1],\n        [ 1, 0, 0],\n        [ 1, 1, -2]]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the New Matrix C_o**\nFinally, we can calculate the matrix C in the observer canonical form (C_o) using the formula C_o = C * T^-1.\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0],\n       [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 1],\n                     [ 1, 0, 0],\n                     [ 1, 1, -2]]\n\nC_o = [[(0*(-1) + 1*1 + 0*1), (0*0 + 1*0 + 0*1), (0*1 + 1*0 + 0*(-2))],\n       [(1*(-1) + 1*1 + 0*1), (1*0 + 1*0 + 0*1), (1*1 + 1*0 + 0*(-2))]]\n\nC_o = [[1, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 1]]\n\nThis result has the expected structure for an observer canonical form with observability indices nu_1=2 and nu_2=1."
