    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (drawing a random English letter) until a specific sequence appears. This is a classic problem in probability, often solved using the concept of overlapping strings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n- **Process:** We are generating a sequence of random English letters.\n- **Alphabet Size (k):** There are 26 English letters, so k = 26.\n- **Probability:** Each letter is chosen with uniform probability, which is 1/26.\n- **Target Sequence (S):** The sequence we are waiting for is \"TENETENET\".\n- **Goal:** Find the expected number of letters we need to generate to see \"TENETENET\" for the first time.\n\n**2. Choose a Method**\nA powerful and straightforward method for this type of problem uses the overlaps within the target sequence. The formula for the expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `n` from an alphabet of size `k` is:\n`E = Î£ (from i=1 to n) of k^i`, for all `i` such that the prefix of `S` of length `i` is also a suffix of `S`.\n\nIn simpler terms, we need to find all the ways the string `S` can overlap with itself. For each such overlap, we add a term `k^L` to our sum, where `L` is the length of the overlap.\n\n**3. Identify the Parameters**\n- **Target Sequence (S):** `TENETENET`\n- **Length of S (n):** 9\n- **Alphabet Size (k):** 26\n\n**4. Find all Overlaps (Prefixes that are also Suffixes)**\nWe need to compare the prefix of length `i` with the suffix of length `i` for all `i` from 1 to 9.\n\n- **`i = 1`:**\n  - Prefix: `T`\n  - Suffix: `T`\n  - **Match?** Yes. This is an overlap of length 1.\n\n- **`i = 2`:**\n  - Prefix: `TE`\n  - Suffix: `ET`\n  - **Match?** No.\n\n- **`i = 3`:**\n  - Prefix: `TEN`\n  - Suffix: `NET`\n  - **Match?** No.\n\n- **`i = 4`:**\n  - Prefix: `TENE`\n  - Suffix: `ENET`\n  - **Match?** Yes. This is an overlap of length 4.\n\n- **`i = 5`:**\n  - Prefix: `TENET`\n  - Suffix: `TENET`\n  - **Match?** Yes. This is an overlap of length 5.\n\n- **`i = 6`:**\n  - Prefix: `TENETE`\n  - Suffix: `ETENET`\n  - **Match?** No.\n\n- **`i = 7`:**\n  - Prefix: `TENETEN`\n  - Suffix: `NETENET`\n  - **Match?** No.\n\n- **`i = 8`:**\n  - Prefix: `TENETENE`\n  - Suffix: `ENETENET`\n  - **Match?** No.\n\n- **`i = 9`:**\n  - Prefix: `TENETENET`\n  - Suffix: `TENETENET`\n  - **Match?** Yes. The full string always matches itself. This is an overlap of length 9.\n\n**5. Calculate the Expected Time (E)**\nThe expected time `E` is the sum of `k^i` for the lengths `i` of all identified overlaps.\nThe lengths of the overlaps are 1, 4, 5, and 9.\n\nTherefore, the formula for our expected time is:\n`E = 26^1 + 26^4 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n- `26^1 = 26`\n- `26^4 = 456,976`\n- `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n- `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, sum these values:\n`E = 26 + 456,976 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n   `5,429,503,678,976`\n`+      11,881,376`\n`+         456,976`\n`+              26`\n`----------------------`\n   `5,429,516,017,354`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,516,017,354.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identify Overlaps:** The most critical step is carefully comparing prefixes with suffixes. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect set of terms in the sum.\n2.  **Use the correct formula:** The formula relies on adding powers of the alphabet size (`k`), not just counting overlaps. The power corresponds to the length of the overlap.\n3.  **Include the full string:** The prefix/suffix of length `n` (the full string) is always an overlap and must be included. This term, `k^n`, will be the largest component of the sum.\n4.  **Arithmetic Precision:** The numbers involved can be very large. Care must be taken during the summation to avoid calculation errors.\n\n<<<5429516017354>>>"
