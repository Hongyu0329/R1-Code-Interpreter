    "An analysis of the problem leads to the most memory-efficient C program solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Question Analysis\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings.\n2.  **Input:** Two strings are provided on separate lines. They are guaranteed to be of the same length, ranging from 1 to 100 characters. The characters are uppercase or lowercase Latin letters.\n3.  **Comparison Logic:** The comparison must treat uppercase letters as equivalent to their lowercase counterparts (e.g., 'A' == 'a'). The comparison should proceed character by character from left to right. The final result depends on the first pair of non-equivalent characters.\n4.  **Output:** The program must print \"-1\" if the first string is smaller, \"1\" if it is larger, and \"0\" if they are equal.\n5.  **Primary Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient\". This implies minimizing the total bytes used by variables.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Case-Insensitivity:** This is the core requirement. Using a function like `tolower()` from the `<ctype.h>` library is essential to normalize characters before comparing them.\n*   **Mandatory Buffer:** To compare the i-th character of the first string with the i-th character of the second, we must have access to both. Since input is read sequentially, we cannot access a character from the first string after it has been read and the program has moved on to the second string. Therefore, it is necessary to store at least one of the strings in memory.\n*   **Avoiding a Second Buffer:** A naive approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays. A more memory-efficient solution stores only the first string. It then reads the second string character-by-character and performs the comparison on-the-fly, discarding each character of the second string after it's used.\n*   **Efficient Input Reading:** Using `getchar()` to read character by character provides the fine-grained control needed for the memory-efficient approach. Standard input functions like `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` are less suitable as they typically read the whole string at once, which would force us to declare a buffer for it.\n*   **Data Type Sizing:** To minimize memory, variable data types should be chosen carefully.\n    *   An index variable `i` for a string of length 100 only needs to count up to 100. An `unsigned char` (1 byte, range 0-255) is sufficient and more memory-efficient than a standard `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n    *   The variable used to store the result of `getchar()` must be an `int`, not a `char`. This is because `getchar()` returns `EOF` (an integer constant, usually -1) on end-of-file, and an `int` is required to distinguish this value from all possible valid character values.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Algorithm Design:** The most memory-efficient algorithm is as follows:\n    *   Allocate a character buffer just large enough for the first string (100 chars + 1 null terminator).\n    *   Read the first string from standard input character by character using `getchar()` and store it in the buffer.\n    *   Initialize an index to traverse the buffer.\n    *   Read the second string character by character using `getchar()`. For each character read:\n        *   Compare it case-insensitively with the character at the current index of the stored first string.\n        *   If a difference is found, print the appropriate result (`-1` or `1`) and terminate immediately. This avoids the need for a `result` variable.\n    *   If the loop completes without any difference being found, the strings are equal, so print `0`.\n\n2.  **Variable Declaration and Memory Calculation:**\n    Based on this algorithm, the C program would require the following variables in its `main` function:\n    *   A character array to store the first string: `char s1[101];`\n        *   Memory used: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n    *   An index to traverse `s1`: `unsigned char i;`\n        *   Memory used: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   A variable to receive the return value of `getchar()`: `int c;`\n        *   Memory used: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes** (on a typical 32/64-bit system).\n\n3.  **Total Memory Calculation (m):**\n    The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n    *   `m = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(c)`\n    *   `m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes`\n    *   `m = 106 bytes`\n\nThis is the most memory-efficient implementation because storing the first string is unavoidable, and the variables for reading input (`c`) and indexing (`i`) are necessary and have been sized to their minimal possible types.\n\n<<<106>>>"
