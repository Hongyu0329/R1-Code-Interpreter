    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific film that meets three criteria:\n1.  It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must feature a \"Luxor Obelisk\" on-screen.\n3.  It must be the *first* film to meet both of the above criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\".**\nThere are two famous Luxor Obelisks from the reign of Ramesses II.\n*   One stands at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The other was given to France in the 19th century and now stands at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\nA film depicting either of these locations could qualify. Films set in Paris are more common among Oscar winners than films set in Luxor, Egypt, making the Paris obelisk a more likely candidate to appear first.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically review Best Picture winners for relevant settings.**\nWe will go through the list of Best Picture winners, looking for films set in either Paris, France, or Luxor, Egypt.\n\n*   **1927/28 - 1936:** Winners from this period (*Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Grand Hotel*, *It Happened One Night*, etc.) are primarily set in the USA, Germany, or England, with no clear scenes depicting either obelisk.\n*   ***The Life of Emile Zola* (1937):** This film is a biopic set in late 19th-century Paris. While it is set in the correct city, the production was largely filmed on Warner Bros. studio backlots recreating Paris. It is difficult to confirm a clear, identifiable shot of the actual Place de la Concorde or its obelisk. Any depiction would likely be a brief establishing shot or part of a matte painting, and it is not a certainty.\n*   **1938 - 1950:** This period includes winners like *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *Casablanca*, and *All the King's Men*. None are set in a location that would feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n*   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This musical is a celebration of the city of Paris. Its famous 17-minute final ballet sequence is an impressionistic journey through the city's landmarks. This sequence explicitly features a stylized set representing the Place de la Concorde, which prominently includes the Luxor Obelisk and the surrounding fountains. This is a definite and intentional depiction.\n*   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** This travel-adventure epic was renowned for its on-location photography. The story begins with a journey from London to Paris, and an early sequence features a hot-air balloon ride over France. This sequence includes clear, real-life aerial shots of Paris, where the Place de la Concorde and the Luxor Obelisk are visible. However, this film won five years *after* *An American in Paris*.\n*   ***Gigi* (1958):** Another musical set in Paris, this film also features many on-location shots of Parisian landmarks, including the Place de la Concorde. Like the previous entry, it comes chronologically after *An American in Paris*.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the candidates and determine the first.**\n*   While *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is the earliest candidate set in Paris, a verifiable on-screen depiction of the obelisk is not confirmed.\n*   *An American in Paris* (1951) features a clear, though artistically stylized, depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde as a key element in its climactic ballet sequence.\n*   Later winners like *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) and *Gigi* (1958) also show the obelisk, but they came after 1951.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBased on the chronological review, the first verifiable instance of a Luxor Obelisk appearing in a Best Picture-winning film is in *An American in Paris*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
