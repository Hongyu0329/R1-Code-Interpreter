The asymptotic behavior of the generating function H(s,s') in the limit as the separation |s′−s| approaches zero is given by the expansion:

H(s,s′) = |s′−s| - (κ(s)² / 24) * |s′−s|³ + O(|s′−s|⁴)

Here, κ(s) is the local curvature of the boundary at the point s. This expression characterizes the leading-order influence of curvature on the generating function, showing that the Euclidean distance (chord length) between two nearby points is less than the arc-length distance by an amount proportional to the square of the curvature and the cube of the separation.
