    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor**\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nWe can test for small prime divisors:\n*   The sum of digits is $5+3+5+9+9=31$, which is not divisible by 3.\n*   The number does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.\n*   Testing for 7: $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$.\n*   Now we factor $7657$. Testing for 13: $7657 \\div 13 = 589$.\n*   Now we factor $589$. Testing for 19: $589 \\div 19 = 31$.\n*   The numbers 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all prime numbers.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: The conductor is a product of distinct odd primes. This simplifies the conditions for a character to be primitive.\n\n**Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters and the Primitivity Condition**\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$, denoted $G_d$, is isomorphic to the direct product of the character groups for each prime factor:\n$G_{53599} \\cong G_7 \\times G_{13} \\times G_{19} \\times G_{31}$.\nThis means any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where each $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo the prime $p$.\n\nA character $\\chi$ with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-principal (non-trivial). The principal character is the unique character of order 1. Therefore, for $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d=53599$, we require that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must not be 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2**: The condition for primitivity is that none of the component characters $\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31}$ can be the principal character. This means their orders must be strictly greater than 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Order of the Character**\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\nWe are given that this order must be 6. Let $k_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. The condition is:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$.\n\nThis lcm condition implies several things about the individual orders $k_p$:\n1.  Each $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6. So, $k_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  At least one of the orders $k_p$ must be a multiple of 2.\n3.  At least one of the orders $k_p$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the Characters**\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$, $G_p$, is a cyclic group of order $p-1$. In a cyclic group of order $n$, the number of elements of order $k$ (for any $k$ that divides $n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\nLet's check the orders of the character groups for our primes:\n*   $|G_7| = 7-1=6$\n*   $|G_{13}| = 13-1=12$\n*   $|G_{19}| = 19-1=18$\n*   $|G_{31}| = 31-1=30$\n\nNow, we combine the conditions on the orders $k_p$:\n*   From primitivity: $k_p \\neq 1$.\n*   From $\\text{lcm}=6$: $k_p$ must divide 6.\n*   From group structure: $k_p$ must divide $p-1$.\n\nSo, for each prime factor $p$, the order $k_p$ must be a non-1 divisor of $\\text{gcd}(6, p-1)$.\n*   For $p=7$, $k_7$ must be a non-1 divisor of $\\text{gcd}(6, 6) = 6$. So $k_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   For $p=13$, $k_{13}$ must be a non-1 divisor of $\\text{gcd}(6, 12) = 6$. So $k_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   For $p=19$, $k_{19}$ must be a non-1 divisor of $\\text{gcd}(6, 18) = 6$. So $k_{19} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   For $p=31$, $k_{31}$ must be a non-1 divisor of $\\text{gcd}(6, 30) = 6$. So $k_{31} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Careful Point 3**: For all four prime factors of $d$, the possible orders for their corresponding non-trivial component characters (that can contribute to a character of order 6) are from the same set: $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe now count the number of ways to choose the four component characters.\nFor any of our primes $p$, the number of characters of a specific order $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 2$.\n\nWe will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\nFirst, let's count the total number of primitive character tuples where each component's order is a divisor of 6. This means the order $k_p$ for each component must be from the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nFor each prime factor, the number of available characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are four prime factors, the total number of such tuples of characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, from this set of 625 character tuples, we must remove those for which the lcm of the orders is not 6.\nLet $(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31})$ be the tuple of orders, where each $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nThe lcm is *not* 6 if either:\na) The lcm is not divisible by 2 (meaning all orders $k_p$ are not divisible by 2).\nb) The lcm is not divisible by 3 (meaning all orders $k_p$ are not divisible by 3).\n\nCase (a): No order is a multiple of 2.\nThis implies all orders $k_p$ must be 3.\nThe number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$ for each prime factor.\nThe number of such character tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nCase (b): No order is a multiple of 3.\nThis implies all orders $k_p$ must be 2.\nThe number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$ for each prime factor.\nThe number of such character tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe two cases are disjoint (a character tuple cannot have all its components of order 3 *and* all of order 2 simultaneously). Therefore, the total number of \"bad\" tuples is the sum of the counts from these two cases.\nNumber of bad tuples = $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe number of desired primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of candidates minus the bad tuples.\nNumber of characters = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\n1.  Factor $d = 53599 = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$.\n2.  For a primitive character $\\chi=\\chi_7\\chi_{13}\\chi_{19}\\chi_{31}$ of order 6, each component $\\chi_p$ must have order $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, and the lcm of the orders must be 6.\n3.  Number of characters mod $p$ for each allowed order:\n    *   $N_p(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N_p(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N_p(6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n4.  Total ways to pick a character of order from $\\{2,3,6\\}$ for each of the 4 primes: $(1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\n5.  Subtract cases where lcm is not 6:\n    *   lcm has no factor of 3 (all orders are 2): $1^4 = 1$.\n    *   lcm has no factor of 2 (all orders are 3): $2^4 = 16$.\n6.  Final count: $625 - (1 + 16) = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
