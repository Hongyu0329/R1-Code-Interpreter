    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the imprints on the specified capsules.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Product and Dosages:** The query is specifically about Teva brand fluoxetine capsules in two strengths: 10mg and 20mg.\n2.  **Research Imprint Codes:** The next step is to find the official imprint codes for each of these specific pharmaceutical products. Pharmaceutical databases like the FDA's NDC Directory or Drugs.com are reliable sources for this information.\n3.  **Find the Imprint for the 10mg Capsule:** Research shows that the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is imprinted with \"PLIVA 93 42\".\n4.  **Find the Imprint for the 20mg Capsule:** Similarly, research for the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule shows its imprint is \"PLIVA 93 43\".\n5.  **Apply the Constraints:** The question has several specific constraints that must be followed:\n    *   Identify the *different numbers*.\n    *   Do not mention color differences.\n    *   Do not mention the word \"PLIVA\".\n    *   Do not mention size differences.\n6.  **Filter the Information:** Based on the constraints, we must remove the word \"PLIVA\" from our findings and focus solely on the numerical part of the imprint.\n    *   For the 10mg capsule, the numbers are **93 42**.\n    *   For the 20mg capsule, the numbers are **93 43**.\n7.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The different numbers imprinted on the capsules are \"93 42\" for the 10mg strength and \"93 43\" for the 20mg strength.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Manufacturer Specificity:** It is crucial to look up the imprint for Teva brand specifically, as other manufacturers of fluoxetine will use different imprints.\n*   **Adherence to Negative Constraints:** The exclusion of the word \"PLIVA\" is a key instruction. Although \"PLIVA\" is part of the full imprint (as Teva acquired Pliva), the question explicitly forbids its mention.\n*   **Focusing on \"Numbers\":** The question asks for the \"different numbers\", implying the full numerical code, not just the part of the code that changes (e.g., just \"42\" and \"43\"). Therefore, providing the full number combination \"93 42\" and \"93 43\" is the most accurate answer.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsules are imprinted with the numbers \"93 42\" and the 20mg capsules are imprinted with the numbers \"93 43\".>>>"
