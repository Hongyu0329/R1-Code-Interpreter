    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object**\nThe object $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. A hypersurface is the zero set of a single polynomial. \"Quintic\" means this polynomial is homogeneous of degree 5. \"Smooth\" implies that the complex gradient of the defining polynomial does not vanish at any point on $X$. As a subset of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, $X$ is a compact complex manifold of dimension 2, and therefore a compact, orientable, real manifold of dimension 4.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Homotopy Groups to Homology Groups**\nThe question asks for the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$. For abelian groups, the rank is the dimension of the free part. Directly computing homotopy groups is often difficult. However, we can relate them to homology groups using the Hurewicz theorem.\n\nThe rational Hurewicz theorem, a result by Jean-Pierre Serre, states that if a space $Y$ is simply connected (i.e., $\\pi_1(Y)=0$), then for any integer $k \\ge 1$, the Hurewicz map induces an isomorphism on the rationalized groups:\n$h_k \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}: \\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_k(Y, \\mathbb{Q})$\n\nThe dimension of the vector space $\\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_k(Y)$. The dimension of $H_k(Y, \\mathbb{Q})$ is, by definition, the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k(Y)$. Therefore, for a simply connected space $Y$, we have:\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_k(Y)) = b_k(Y)$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nSo, our strategy will be:\n1.  Show that $X$ is simply connected.\n2.  Compute the third Betti number, $b_3(X)$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that $X$ is Simply Connected**\nWe use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homotopy groups. This theorem states that if $V$ is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension $n$, and $Y \\subset V$ is a smooth hyperplane section (or more generally, a section of a sufficiently ample line bundle), the inclusion map $i: Y \\hookrightarrow V$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $i_*: \\pi_k(Y) \\to \\pi_k(V)$ for $k \\le n-2$.\n\nIn our case, we can take $V = \\mathbb{CP}^3$, which has complex dimension $n=3$. Our space $X$ is a smooth hypersurface of degree 5, which is a section of the ample line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(5)$. The theorem applies, and it tells us that the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_k$ for $k \\le 3-2 = 1$.\n\nFor $k=1$, this gives an isomorphism:\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$\n\nThe complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected for any $n \\ge 1$. This can be seen from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the fibration $S^1 \\to S^{2n+1} \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$. Therefore, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n\nIt follows that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. Thus, $X$ is simply connected.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial that $X$ is simply connected to relate the rank of homotopy to Betti numbers. The Lefschetz theorem provides this critical piece of information.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Third Betti Number, $b_3(X)$**\nNow that we have established that $X$ is simply connected, we need to compute $b_3(X) = \\text{rank}(H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\nWe use two powerful tools: Poincaré Duality and the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homology.\n\n1.  **Poincaré Duality:** Since $X$ is a compact, orientable real manifold of dimension 4, Poincaré duality holds. This duality implies a relationship between Betti numbers: $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$. For $k=3$, we get:\n    $b_3(X) = b_{4-3}(X) = b_1(X)$.\n\n2.  **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for Homology:** Similar to the homotopy version, this theorem states that the inclusion $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homology groups $i_*: H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z})$ for $k \\le \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathbb{CP}^3)-2 = 1$.\n\nFor $k=1$, this gives an isomorphism:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThe homology of complex projective space is well known: $H_{2j}(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ for $0 \\le j \\le n$ and $H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k$ odd. Thus, $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nIt follows that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Putting it together:** Since $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, its rank, the first Betti number $b_1(X)$, is 0. From Poincaré duality, we have $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$. Therefore, $b_3(X) = 0$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The argument relies on two major theorems. The validity of each theorem for our space $X$ must be confirmed. $X$ being a smooth compact complex manifold ensures it is orientable for Poincaré Duality. Being a smooth ample section in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ ensures Lefschetz's theorem applies. The degree of the hypersurface (quintic, i.e., degree 5) does not affect this particular argument, as long as it results in a smooth manifold.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nWe have shown that:\n*   $X$ is simply connected.\n*   For a simply connected space, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$.\n*   Using Poincaré duality and the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we calculated $b_3(X) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0. This means that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a purely torsion group.\n\n<<<0>>>"
