No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.

Here is the detailed analysis:

1.  **Different Monomers (Building Blocks):**
    *   **Polysaccharides** are polymers of **monosaccharides** (simple sugars like glucose).
    *   **Polynucleotides** are polymers of **nucleotides**. A nucleotide is a more complex monomer made of three parts: a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group.
    *   The monomer of a polynucleotide is not a sugar; it is a nucleotide.

2.  **Different Backbone Structure:**
    *   The backbone of a **polysaccharide** is a chain of sugar units linked directly to each other (...sugar-sugar-sugar...).
    *   The backbone of a **polynucleotide** is a chain of alternating sugar and phosphate units (...sugar-phosphate-sugar-phosphate...). The presence of phosphorus is a key structural difference.

3.  **Different Chemical Linkages:**
    *   In **polysaccharides**, the sugar monomers are joined by **glycosidic bonds**.
    *   In **polynucleotides**, the nucleotide monomers are joined by **phosphodiester bonds**.

These fundamental differences in monomer composition, backbone structure, and chemical linkage mean that polynucleotides and polysaccharides are two entirely distinct types of biological polymers.

This is also true for **homopolynucleotides**. A homopolynucleotide (e.g., Poly(A), made only of adenine nucleotides) is still a polynucleotide with a sugar-phosphate backbone and phosphodiester bonds. Its monomer is still a nucleotide, not a monosaccharide. Therefore, a homopolynucleotide is not structurally a polysaccharide.
