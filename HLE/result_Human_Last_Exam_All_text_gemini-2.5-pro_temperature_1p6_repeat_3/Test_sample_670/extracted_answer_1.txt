The Tate-style program-expression graph represents the final value of `a` with a `select1` node as its root. This node takes its input from a `μ` node. The `μ` node is parameterized by two bound variables, `a` and `b`. The initial values for the recursion within `μ` are provided by two constant `1` nodes (representing the initial values of the program variables `a` and `i`). The body of the `μ` node's recursive function produces a pair of values. The first value is the result of a `*` node whose inputs are the bound variables `a` and `b`. The second value is the result of a `+` node whose inputs are the bound variable `b` and a third constant `1` node.
