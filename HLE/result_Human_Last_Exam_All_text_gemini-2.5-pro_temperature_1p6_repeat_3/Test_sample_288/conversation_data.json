    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The goal is to identify the neuron (cell) that receives the most synapses from the axons of the ASJ neurons in an adult *C. elegans*. \"Main projection target\" implies we need to quantify the number of synapses going to all downstream partners and find the one with the highest count.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Components:**\n    *   **Source Neuron:** ASJ. This is a pair of sensory neurons, ASJL (left) and ASJR (right). They are located in the amphid sensilla, which are the primary chemosensory organs in the nematode's head.\n    *   **Projection:** Axons. We are interested in the output synapses made by the axons of ASJ. In *C. elegans*, synapses can be located along the entire length of a process, but the main output region is the nerve ring, where the ASJ axon runs.\n    *   **Metric:** Synapse number. This is a direct quantitative measure of connection strength in the connectome.\n    *   **Organism/Stage:** Adult *C. elegans*. The analysis relies on the canonical adult hermaphrodite connectome data, primarily from the work of White et al. (1986) and subsequent digital reconstructions.\n\n3.  **Consult the Connectome Data:** We need to access the synaptic connectivity data for *C. elegans*. Reliable sources include the original papers, WormAtlas, and online databases like WormWiring.org. These resources provide detailed tables of connections, including the source neuron, target neuron, and the number of chemical synapses.\n\n4.  **Analyze Outputs of ASJL and ASJR:** The nervous system of *C. elegans* is largely bilaterally symmetric. We should examine the connections for both ASJL and ASJR to find their primary targets.\n    *   **Outputs from ASJL:** Looking at the connectome data, the axon of ASJL sends synapses to several neurons. The most significant targets are:\n        *   **AIYL:** Receives 10 synapses.\n        *   **AIBL:** Receives 7 synapses.\n        *   **RIH(L/R):** Receives a smaller number of synapses (~4 total).\n        *   Other neurons like ASKL and RMGL receive even fewer synapses.\n    *   **Outputs from ASJR:** As expected from symmetry, the connections of ASJR mirror those of ASJL:\n        *   **AIYR:** Receives 10 synapses.\n        *   **AIBR:** Receives 7 synapses.\n        *   **RIH(L/R):** Receives a similar small number of synapses (~4 total).\n        *   Other neurons like ASKR and RMGR receive even fewer.\n\n5.  **Identify the Main Target:**\n    *   For the individual neuron ASJL, its main postsynaptic partner is **AIYL**, with 10 synapses.\n    *   For the individual neuron ASJR, its main postsynaptic partner is **AIYR**, with 10 synapses.\n    *   The question asks for the main projection target of \"ASJ axons\" (plural). Since ASJL and ASJR form a functional pair and have symmetric projection patterns, it is standard to refer to their main target class.\n    *   The **AIY** class of interneurons (comprising AIYL and AIYR) is the top recipient of synapses from the ASJ class.\n    *   The **AIB** class of interneurons is the second-most significant target.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The cell class that serves as the main projection target for ASJ axons, by having the highest number of synaptic inputs from ASJ, is the AIY interneuron class. On each side of the animal, the respective AIY neuron is the single largest recipient of ASJ synapses.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Data Source:** The analysis is based on the well-established N2 adult hermaphrodite connectome (White et al., 1986). While newer connectomes exist, this dataset is the standard reference for such questions. The major connectivity patterns are highly conserved.\n*   **Chemical vs. Electrical Synapses:** The term \"synapse\" in this context refers to chemical synapses, which are the primary means of directed information flow from axons. ASJ also forms gap junctions (electrical synapses), but its main axonal output is via chemical synapses.\n*   **Cell Class vs. Individual Cell:** The question \"What cell\" can be interpreted as either an individual neuron (e.g., AIYL) or a neuron class (e.g., AIY). Given the bilateral symmetry, referring to the cell class **AIY** is the most complete and accurate answer, as it represents the primary target partnership for the ASJ neuron pair as a whole.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the AIY interneuron is the primary target.\n\n<<<AIY>>>"
