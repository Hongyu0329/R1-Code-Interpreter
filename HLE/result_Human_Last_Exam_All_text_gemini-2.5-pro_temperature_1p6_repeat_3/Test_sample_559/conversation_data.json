    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\nThe system is:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n$u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\nWe will analyze the system in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points occur when $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points.**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix of the system $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$u' = u^3-u^2$\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3$\n$J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3-3u^2 & 4d+5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   At $(1,0)$: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   At $(1,-1)$: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) + 4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n*   At $(0,0)$: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive, so this is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the separatrices.**\nSeparatrices are curves in the phase plane that separate regions of qualitatively different behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. We will find these manifolds for the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\n*   **Stable Manifold of (1, -1):**\n    The eigenvector for the stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_2=-2$ is found by solving $(J - (-2)I)v = 0$:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which gives $3v_u=0 \\implies v_u=0$. The eigenvector is $v_s = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This means the stable manifold is tangent to the vertical line at $(1,-1)$. Let's check the invariant line $u=1$. For $u=1$, $u'=0$, so trajectories starting on this line stay on it. The dynamics on this line are given by $d' = 2d(d+1)$. Trajectories on the line $u=1$ approach $d=-1$ if they start with any $d<0$. Thus, the stable manifold of $(1,-1)$ is the ray $\\{(1,d) | d<0\\}$, which lies on the line $u=1$.\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold of (1, -1):**\n    The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$ is found by solving $(J - I)v = 0$:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which gives $-6v_u - 3v_d=0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is $v_u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The unstable manifold leaves $(1,-1)$ with a slope of $-2$. Let's test for a simple invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$. We can try a simple polynomial $d=-u^2$.\n    If $d=-u^2$, then $\\frac{dd}{dt} = -2u \\frac{du}{dt} = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = 2u^3(1-u)$.\n    Now substitute $d=-u^2$ into the first ODE:\n    $d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u) = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3 = 2u^3(1-u)$.\n    Since both expressions for $d'$ are equal, $d=-u^2$ is an invariant curve (a trajectory).\n    This curve passes through $(0,0)$ and $(1,-1)$. The slope of the curve at $u=1$ is $d'(u)|_{u=1} = -2u|_{u=1} = -2$, which matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector. Thus, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the separatrix.**\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. These are the line $u=1$ (which contains the stable manifold) and the parabola $d=-u^2$ (which is the unstable manifold). A trajectory that connects two equilibrium points is called a heteroclinic orbit and is a classic example of a separatrix. The curve $d=-u^2$ connects the saddle point $(1,-1)$ to the degenerate node $(0,0)$. This is often considered the most significant separatrix structuring the phase plane.\n\nThe question asks to find \"the\" separatrix, which suggests a single answer. The invariant curve $d=-u^2$ is a non-trivial solution and represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point. It is a single, continuous curve that is a specific trajectory of the system. This is a very strong candidate for the intended answer.\n\nThe equation of this separatrix is $d = -u^2$."
