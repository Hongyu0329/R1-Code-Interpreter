The partition function Z for the system is given by:
$Z = \prod_k \left[1 \mp e^{\beta\mu} \right]^{\mp 1}$
where $\mu$ is the effective chemical potential, $\beta=1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature, and the product runs over all single-particle states $k$.
The upper sign ($-$) applies to bosons, resulting in $Z_B = \prod_k \frac{1}{1 - e^{\beta\mu}}$.
The lower sign ($+$) applies to fermions, resulting in $Z_F = \prod_k (1 + e^{\beta\mu})$.
