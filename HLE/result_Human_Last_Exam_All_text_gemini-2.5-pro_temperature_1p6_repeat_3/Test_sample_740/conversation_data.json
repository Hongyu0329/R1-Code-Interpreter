    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the integral equation to find the values of $\\lambda$ for which there is no solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral Equation and its Kernel**\n\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_{0}^{1} K(x, y) u(y) dy$\nwhere the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the kernel using the formula for the difference of powers:\n$a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\dots + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1})$.\nSo, the kernel becomes a polynomial in x and y:\n$K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, which means it can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y. This property simplifies the analysis significantly. Note that the kernel is symmetric, i.e., $K(x, y) = K(y, x)$. This implies the integral operator is self-adjoint, which guarantees that its eigenvalues are real.\n\n**Step 2: Reduce the Integral Equation to a System of Linear Equations**\n\nSubstitute the separable kernel back into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k \\right) u(y) dy$\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_{0}^{1} y^k u(y) dy$\n\nLet's define a set of constants $c_k$:\n$c_k = \\int_{0}^{1} y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nNow, the form of the solution $u(x)$ becomes explicit:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\nThis shows that if a solution exists, it must be a polynomial in x of degree at most $n-1$.\n\nTo find the constants $c_j$, we substitute this form of $u(x)$ back into their definition:\n$c_j = \\int_{0}^{1} y^j \\left( 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k} \\right) dy$\n$c_j = \\int_{0}^{1} y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_{0}^{1} y^j y^{n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\left[ \\frac{y^{j+1}}{j+1} \\right]_0^1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\left[ \\frac{y^{j+n-k}}{j+n-k} \\right]_0^1$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{j+n-k}$.\n\nThis gives a system of $n$ linear algebraic equations for the $n$ unknown constants $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Fredholm's Alternative Theorem**\n\nThe system of equations can be written in matrix form. Let $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$ and $\\mathbf{b} = [1, 1/2, \\dots, 1/n]^T$. The system is $(I - \\lambda A)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\n\nAccording to Fredholm's alternative theorem for integral equations (and correspondingly for linear systems):\n1.  If the homogeneous equation $u(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y) u(y) dy$ has only the trivial solution $u(x)=0$, then the inhomogeneous equation has a unique solution for any continuous function on the right-hand side (here, the function is $f(x)=1$). This occurs when $\\lambda$ is not a characteristic value (eigenvalue) of the integral operator.\n2.  If the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions (eigenfunctions), which occurs when $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value, then the inhomogeneous equation has a solution (in fact, infinitely many) if and only if the right-hand side function $f(x)=1$ is orthogonal to all eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation. If it is not orthogonal to even one eigenfunction, the equation has no solution.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Homogeneous Equation and its Eigenfunctions**\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\phi(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y)\\phi(y)dy$. Its solutions (eigenfunctions) must also be polynomials of degree at most $n-1$.\nThe adjoint homogeneous equation is $\\psi(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(y,x)\\psi(y)dy$. Since our kernel is symmetric ($K(x,y)=K(y,x)$), the operator is self-adjoint, and the eigenfunctions of the original and adjoint problems are the same, $\\phi_k(x) = \\psi_k(x)$.\n\nThe condition for the inhomogeneous equation to have no solution becomes:\n$\\lambda$ must be a characteristic value, and for the corresponding eigenfunction $\\phi_k(x)$, the orthogonality condition must fail:\n$\\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\phi_k(x) dx \\neq 0$.\nHere, $f(x)=1$, so the condition is $\\int_{0}^{1} \\phi_k(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine which characteristic values lead to no solution**\n\nThe eigenfunctions $\\{\\phi_k(x)\\}_{k=0}^{n-1}$ form a basis for the space of polynomials of degree at most $n-1$, denoted $\\mathcal{P}_{n-1}$. They are also orthogonal with respect to the standard L2 inner product on $[0,1]$.\nThe function $f(x)=1$ is a polynomial in $\\mathcal{P}_{n-1}$. We can expand it in the basis of eigenfunctions:\n$1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k \\phi_k(x)$, where $a_k = \\frac{\\langle 1, \\phi_k \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi_k, \\phi_k \\rangle} = \\frac{\\int_0^1 \\phi_k(x) dx}{\\int_0^1 \\phi_k(x)^2 dx}$.\nSince $\\int_0^1 1^2 dx = 1 \\neq 0$, the function $f(x)=1$ is not the zero function. Therefore, not all coefficients $a_k$ can be zero. This means there must exist at least one eigenfunction $\\phi_j(x)$ for which $a_j \\neq 0$. This implies that for this specific eigenfunction $\\phi_j(x)$, we have $\\int_0^1 \\phi_j(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\nIf $\\lambda = \\lambda_j$ (the characteristic value corresponding to $\\phi_j$), the condition for having a solution is not met. Therefore, for this value of $\\lambda$, the equation has no solution.\nThis argument suggests that for any characteristic value $\\lambda_k$ whose eigenspace is not orthogonal to the function $f(x)=1$, there will be no solution. As shown, it is not possible for the space $\\mathcal{P}_{n-1}$ to be entirely orthogonal to the non-zero function $1$ which belongs to it. Hence, for every characteristic value $\\lambda_k$ of the operator, there must be at least one eigenfunction not orthogonal to $1$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are precisely all the characteristic values of the integral operator $L[u](x) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x-y} u(y) dy$ restricted to the space of polynomials of degree at most $n-1$. These are the values of $\\lambda$ for which the homogeneous system of equations derived in Step 2 has a non-trivial solution. This corresponds to the values of $\\lambda$ for which $\\det(I-\\lambda C)=0$, where $C$ is the matrix of the operator L's restriction to the polynomial basis $\\{x^m\\}$. The coefficients of the homogeneous problem led to the matrix $C_{ml} = \\frac{1}{n-m+l}$ for $m, l \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nFinding a general formula for these characteristic values for any $n$ is a difficult problem. We can state the answer in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix.\nThe characteristic values $\\lambda$ satisfy $\\det(I - \\lambda C) = 0$, where $C$ is the $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $C_{ml} = \\frac{1}{n-m+l}$. This is equivalent to saying that $1/\\lambda$ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix $C$.\n\n-   For $n=1$, $C=[1]$. $1/\\lambda=1 \\implies \\lambda=1$.\n-   For $n=2$, $C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/3 \\\\ 1 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues of $C$ are the roots of $(1/2-\\mu)^2 - 1/3 = 0$, which gives $\\mu = 1/2 \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$. The values of $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$ are $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe set of values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution is the set of reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $C$ with entries $C_{ml} = \\frac{1}{n-m+l}$, where $m, l = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$."
