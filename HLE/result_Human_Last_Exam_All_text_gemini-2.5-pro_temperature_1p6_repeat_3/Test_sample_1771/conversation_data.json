    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the phonological development of PIE *seh₂gieti into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Laryngeal Coloring:** The PIE laryngeal `*h₂` has an \"a-coloring\" effect. When next to an `*e` vowel, it typically turns the vowel into `*a`.\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This is the first major sound shift affecting the Germanic languages. It changes the PIE stop consonants. For this root, the relevant change is PIE `*g` (voiced velar stop) > PGmc `*k` (voiceless velar stop). The dental stop in the ending `*-ti` is also affected: PIE `*t` > PGmc `*þ` (voiceless dental fricative).\n3.  **Germanic Vowel Shift:** In North and West Germanic (i.e., all branches except Gothic), PIE long `*ā` (from any source, including `*eh₂`) becomes long `*ō`.\n4.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** A key sound change in North and West Germanic languages. A high front vowel or semi-vowel (`*i` or `*j`) in a following syllable causes a back vowel in the root syllable to become \"fronted\".\n5.  **Palatalization (Old English):** In Old English, velar consonants (`k`, `g`) became palatal consonants (like `ch`, `y`) when they came before or after a front vowel.\n6.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This series of changes distinguishes Old High German from the other West Germanic languages. The relevant changes here are PGmc `*k` > OHG `hh` or `ch` (fricative) and PGmc `*þ` > OHG `d` (which becomes `t` at the end of a word).\n7.  **OHG Diphthongization:** Proto-Germanic long vowel `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** *seh₂g-ie-ti*\n*   **Step 1: Laryngeal Effect.** The laryngeal *h₂ colors the preceding *e* vowel to *a*.\n    *   *seh₂g-* → *sāg-*\n*   **Step 2: Grimm's Law.** The voiced stop *g becomes a voiceless stop *k. The ending *-ti becomes *-þi.\n    *   *sāg-* → *sāk-*\n    *   *-ti* → *-þi*\n*   **Step 3: Suffix Change.** The PIE present suffix *-ie- becomes the Class 1 weak verb suffix *-ja-* in Proto-Germanic. The 3rd person singular present indicative form is *sōkiþ*. The vowel `i` comes from the `j` of the suffix.\n*   **Step 4: North/West Germanic Vowel Shift.** The long vowel *ā becomes long *ō.\n    *   *sāk-* → *sōk-*\n*   **Reconstruction:** Combining these changes gives us the Proto-Germanic 3rd person singular present indicative.\n    *   **Proto-Germanic Result: *\\*sōkiþ*** (The infinitive would be *sōkijaną*, \"to seek\").\n\n**2. Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *\\*sōkiþ*\n*   **Step 1: I-Umlaut.** The `*i` in the ending causes the root vowel `*ō` to be fronted.\n    *   *ō* → *œ* (This vowel is typically spelled `æ` in normalized Old Norse texts).\n    *   *\\*sōkiþ* → *\\*sœkiþ*\n*   **Step 2: Ending Changes.** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` evolves into `*-ir` in Old Norse.\n    *   *\\*-iþ* → *-ir*\n*   **Reconstruction:** Combining the changes gives the Old Norse form.\n    *   **Old Norse Result: *sœkir***\n\n**3. Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *\\*sōkiþ*\n*   **Step 1: I-Umlaut.** The `*i` in the ending causes the root vowel `*ō` to be fronted.\n    *   *ō* → *ē*\n    *   *\\*sōkiþ* → *\\*sēkiþ*\n*   **Step 2: Palatalization.** The velar consonant `*k` is now next to the new front vowel `*ē`, causing it to palatalize into a `ċ` sound (pronounced /tʃ/, like \"ch\" in \"church\").\n    *   *\\*sēkiþ* → *\\*sēċiþ*\n*   **Step 3: Ending Changes.** The ending `*-iþ` weakens to `*-eþ` or is syncopated to `*-þ`.\n    *   *\\*-iþ* → *-eþ*\n*   **Reconstruction:** Combining these changes gives the common Old English form.\n    *   **Old English Result: *sēceþ*** (also found as *sēcþ*)\n\n**4. Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *\\*sōkiþ*\n*   **Step 1: OHG Diphthongization.** The PGmc long vowel `*ō` becomes a diphthong `uo`.\n    *   *\\*sōkiþ* → *\\*suokiþ*\n*   **Step 2: High German Consonant Shift.**\n    *   The intervocalic `*k` shifts to the voiceless velar fricative `*h` (pronounced /x/, like \"ch\" in Scottish \"loch\"). So: *\\*suokiþ* → *\\*suohiþ*.\n    *   The final `*þ` shifts to `*d`, which is then devoiced to `*t` at the end of the word. So: `*-iþ* → `*-it*.\n*   **Step 3: I-Umlaut (Note).** The `*i*` should theoretically cause umlaut on `uo` to `üe`. However, i-umlaut was not consistently applied or written in the Old High German period, especially for the diphthong `uo`. The non-umlauted form is standard.\n*   **Reconstruction:** Combining the sound shifts gives the Old High German form.\n    *   **Old High German Result: *suohhit***\n\n### Final Summary\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *\\*sōkiþ*\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkir*\n*   **Old English:** *sēceþ*\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhit*\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *\\*sōkiþ*\nOld Norse: *sœkir*\nOld English: *sēceþ*\nOld High German: *suohhit*>>>"
