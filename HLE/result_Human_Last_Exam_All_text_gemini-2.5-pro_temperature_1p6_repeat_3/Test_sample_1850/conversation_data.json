    "This question requires a careful and precise reading of John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*. To answer it accurately, we must follow a clear methodology.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Key Term \"Historical Saint\":** First, we must clarify what constitutes a \"historical saint.\" In this context, it refers to a post-biblical figure canonized or widely revered as a saint by Christian traditions (primarily Catholic or Orthodox). This distinction is crucial because *Paradise Lost* is filled with biblical figures who are also considered saints (e.g., Adam, Abraham, Moses, David, the Virgin Mary, the Apostles Peter and Paul). The question's use of \"historical\" directs us to look for figures who lived after the apostolic age.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Locations in the Text:** *Paradise Lost* is a vast poem. However, references to post-biblical church history are concentrated in specific areas. The most likely places to find named saints are:\n    *   **Book III (The Limbo of Vanity):** Milton creates a \"Paradise of Fools\" where he satirizes what he considered the corruptions and vanities of the Roman Catholic Church. This is a prime location for naming the founders of monastic orders.\n    *   **Books XI and XII (The Vision of the Future):** The Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of human history after the Fall. This includes the history of the Church, where corruption is foretold. This section could potentially name figures from church history.\n\n3.  **Execute a Textual Search and Analysis:**\n    *   **Analysis of Book III:** In his description of the Limbo of Vanity, Milton populates it with \"Eremites and Friars, / White, Black, and Grey, with all their trumpery.\" He then becomes more specific about the followers of certain orders who hope to get into heaven through a shortcut:\n        > And they who to be sure of Paradise\n        > Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**,\n        > Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised; (Book III, lines 478-480)\n      *   This passage explicitly mentions two historical saints by name:\n        1.  **Dominic:** This is St. Dominic de Guzmán (c. 1170–1221), the Spanish priest who founded the Dominican Order.\n        2.  **Francis:** This is St. Francis of Assisi (c. 1181–1226), the Italian friar who founded the Franciscan Order. He is referred to by the adjectival eponym \"Franciscan,\" which is a direct and unambiguous reference to his name.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Books XI and XII:** A thorough reading of Michael's prophecy shows that while he describes the future corruption of the Church in detail, he does so in general terms. He speaks of \"grievous wolves\" and those who would \"with superstitions and traditions taint\" the truth. However, he does not name any specific post-biblical popes, doctors of the church (like Augustine or Aquinas), or other saints. Milton's focus remains on biblical figures and general prophecy.\n\n    *   **Searching for Other Names:** A search of the complete text for other major historical saints (such as Augustine, Jerome, Benedict, Gregory, Aquinas, Bede, etc.) finds no mentions. Milton alludes to other historical figures without naming them (for example, Galileo is the \"Tuscan artist\" and the Emperor Constantine is \"that pious Emperour\" who gave the fatal \"Donation\"), but these do not count as being \"mentioned by name.\"\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinguish Biblical vs. Historical:** Do not count figures from the Bible (e.g., Michael, Raphael, Abraham, Moses, David, Peter, Paul), as the term \"historical saint\" points to the post-biblical era.\n*   **Distinguish Mention vs. Allusion:** The person must be mentioned *by name*. An allusion, like the one to Galileo (\"Tuscan artist\"), is not a direct naming.\n*   **Recognize Eponyms:** An adjectival form like \"Franciscan\" is a direct reference to the founder, Francis, and counts as a mention by name in this literary context.\n*   **Consider Milton's Perspective:** As a 17th-century Puritan, Milton's mentions of such saints are critical and satirical, not reverential. He would not use titles like \"Saint\" or \"St.\"\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the text of *Paradise Lost*, only two individuals who fit the description of \"historical saints\" are mentioned by name. Both occur in a satirical passage in Book III.\n\nThe two historical saints mentioned by name are:\n1.  **Dominic**\n2.  **Francis**\n\nTherefore, the total number is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
