    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a solution `(x, y, z)` for a system of equations involving three functions, F, G, and H. The conditions for the existence (and often, uniqueness) of such a point are typically established by generalizing the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a product space.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine these conditions.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Problem\nFirst, we must formally define the space, the functions, and the FGH-tripled fixed point itself. The user's question contains potential typos (`G` used for two different functions), which we will interpret based on common conventions in this field.\n\n*   **Spaces:** We are working with three non-empty sets, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. To use tools from analysis (like the Contraction Principle), we need to impose a structure on these sets. We assume `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are **complete metric spaces**. Completeness is crucial because it guarantees that any Cauchy sequence (a sequence of points that get progressively closer) will converge to a limit within the space.\n*   **Functions:** We have three functions with the following signatures (assuming the second `G` was a typo for `H`):\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Definition:** An element `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it simultaneously satisfies the following three equations:\n    1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n### Step 2: The Strategy - Applying the Banach Fixed Point Theorem\n\nThe core idea is to define a single operator `T` on the product space `W = X × Y × Z` whose fixed point corresponds to the FGH-tripled fixed point we seek. If we can show that `W` is a complete metric space and `T` is a contraction mapping on `W`, then the Banach Fixed Point Theorem guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point.\n\n1.  **Define the Product Space:** Let `W = X × Y × Z`. We can define a metric `d` on `W`, for instance, the sum metric:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    Since `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces, the product space `(W, d)` is also a complete metric space.\n\n2.  **Define the Operator T:** We define the operator `T: W → W` based on the fixed point equations:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n    A fixed point of `T` is a point `(x, y, z)` such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, which is exactly the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Contraction Condition\n\nNow, we need to find the condition that makes `T` a contraction mapping. A mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁`, `w₂` in `W`, we have `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d(w₁, w₂)`.\n\nLet `w₁ = (x, y, z)` and `w₂ = (u, v, w)`. We analyze the distance `d(T(w₁), T(w₂))`:\n\n`d(T(x, y, z), T(u, v, w)) = d_X(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) + d_Y(G(y,x,y), G(v,u,v)) + d_Z(H(z,y,x), H(w,v,u))`\n\nTo bound this expression, we must assume that the functions F, G, and H satisfy a mixed Lipschitz-type condition.\n\n**Careful Point:** This is the central condition on the functions F, G, and H. There must exist non-negative constants (`α, β, γ, ...`) that bound the change in the output of each function based on the change in their inputs.\n\nLet's assume the following inequalities hold for all `x, u ∈ X`, `y, v ∈ Y`, and `z, w ∈ Z`:\n\n*   `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α d_X(x, u) + β d_Y(y, v) + γ d_Z(z, w)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ δ d_Y(y, v) + ε d_X(x, u)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ ζ d_Z(z, w) + η d_Y(y, v) + θ d_X(x, u)`\n\nSubstituting these into our distance formula for `T`:\n`d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ [α d_X(x,u) + β d_Y(y,v) + γ d_Z(z,w)] + [δ d_Y(y,v) + ε d_X(x,u)] + [ζ d_Z(z,w) + η d_Y(y,v) + θ d_X(x,u)]`\n\nNow, we group the terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n`d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (α+ε+θ)d_X(x,u) + (β+δ+η)d_Y(y,v) + (γ+ζ)d_Z(z,w)`\n\nWe need this to be `≤ k * (d_X(x, u) + d_Y(y, v) + d_Z(z, w))` for some `k < 1`.\nLet `k_x = α+ε+θ`, `k_y = β+δ+η`, and `k_z = γ+ζ`.\nThen `d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k_x d_X(x,u) + k_y d_Y(y,v) + k_z d_Z(z,w)`.\n\nThis inequality holds if we set `k = max{k_x, k_y, k_z}`. For `T` to be a contraction, we need `k < 1`. This implies that each of `k_x`, `k_y`, and `k_z` must be less than 1.\n\n### Final Answer: The Conditions\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are guaranteed under the following conditions:\n\n1.  **Space Condition:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **Contraction Mappings Condition:** There exist non-negative constants `α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ` such that for all `x, u ∈ X`, `y, v ∈ Y`, and `z, w ∈ Z`, the following inequalities (mixed Lipschitz conditions) are satisfied:\n    *   `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α d_X(x, u) + β d_Y(y, v) + γ d_Z(z, w)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ δ d_Y(y, v) + ε d_X(x, u)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ ζ d_Z(z, w) + η d_Y(y, v) + θ d_X(x, u)`\n\n3.  **Global Contraction Condition:** The sums of the constants must satisfy:\n    *   `α + ε + θ < 1`\n    *   `β + δ + η < 1`\n    *   `γ + ζ < 1`\n\nIf these three sets of conditions are met, then there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z`.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z are as follows, based on an extension of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem:\n\n1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be **complete metric spaces** with respective metrics d_X, d_Y, and d_Z.\n\n2.  **Function Contractiveness:** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed Lipschitz-type condition. This means there exist non-negative constants `α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ` such that for any two sets of points `(x, y, z)` and `(u, v, w)`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α⋅d_X(x, u) + β⋅d_Y(y, v) + γ⋅d_Z(z, w)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ δ⋅d_Y(y, v) + ε⋅d_X(x, u)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ ζ⋅d_Z(z, w) + η⋅d_Y(y, v) + θ⋅d_X(x, u)`\n\n3.  **Overall Contraction Sum:** The sum of the constants corresponding to each space's metric must be less than 1. This ensures that the overall mapping on the product space `X×Y×Z` is a contraction.\n    *   `α + ε + θ < 1`\n    *   `β + δ + η < 1`\n    *   `γ + ζ < 1`\n\nIf all these conditions are fulfilled, there exists a unique triplet `(x, y, z)` satisfying `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`.>>>"
