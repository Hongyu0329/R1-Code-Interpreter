    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups**\n*   **Wallpaper groups** (or plane crystallographic groups) are the 17 distinct mathematical groups that describe all possible repeating two-dimensional patterns. They combine translational symmetry with point symmetries.\n*   The **point group** (or crystal class) of a wallpaper group consists of all the symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the pattern unmoved. Translations and glide reflections are not point symmetries themselves, but their rotational and reflectional components contribute to the point group.\n*   The **order** of a group is the number of elements it contains. We are looking for wallpaper groups whose corresponding point group has exactly two elements.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Point Groups of Order 2**\nIn two dimensions, the allowed point symmetries are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold rotations, and reflections. The point groups are collections of these symmetries. Let's list the possible 2D crystallographic point groups and their orders:\n*   **C1**: {Identity}. Order 1.\n*   **C2**: {Identity, 180° rotation}. **Order 2**.\n*   **C3**: {Identity, 120° rotation, 240° rotation}. Order 3.\n*   **C4**: Contains rotations of 90°. Order 4.\n*   **C6**: Contains rotations of 60°. Order 6.\n*   **D1** (also denoted **m** or **C_s**): {Identity, one reflection}. **Order 2**.\n*   **D2** (also denoted **mm2** or **C_2v**): Contains two perpendicular reflections. Order 4.\n*   **D3** (also denoted **3m** or **C_3v**): Order 6.\n*   **D4** (also denoted **4mm** or **C_4v**): Order 8.\n*   **D6** (also denoted **6mm** or **C_6v**): Order 12.\n\nFrom this list, the only point groups with an order of 2 are **C2** and **D1 (m)**.\n\n**Step 3: Find Wallpaper Groups with Point Groups C2 and D1**\nNow, we need to go through the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones correspond to the point groups C2 and D1. The 17 wallpaper groups are typically classified by their lattice system and point group.\n\n**Wallpaper Groups with Point Group C2:**\n*   This point group consists only of 2-fold (180°) rotational symmetry.\n*   The only wallpaper group with this point group is **p2**. Its symmetries are translations and 2-fold rotations.\n\n**Wallpaper Groups with Point Group D1 (m):**\n*   This point group consists only of a single reflection line symmetry.\n*   Careful Point: Wallpaper groups with glide reflections also fall into this category. A glide reflection is a reflection followed by a translation parallel to the reflection line. When determining the point group, the translational component is ignored, leaving just the reflection operation.\n*   The wallpaper groups with point group D1 (m) are:\n    1.  **pm**: Contains primitive cells and reflection lines.\n    2.  **pg**: Contains primitive cells and glide reflection lines. The point group is still D1 (m).\n    3.  **cm**: Contains centered cells and reflection lines (which implies glide lines are also present). The point group is D1 (m).\n\n**Step 4: Count the Identified Groups**\nLet's list all the wallpaper groups we found whose point group has an order of 2:\n1.  **p2** (Point Group C2, Order 2)\n2.  **pm** (Point Group D1, Order 2)\n3.  **pg** (Point Group D1, Order 2)\n4.  **cm** (Point Group D1, Order 2)\n\nThere are a total of four such groups. For completeness, none of the other 13 wallpaper groups (p1, pmm, pmg, pgg, cmm, p4, p4m, p4g, p3, p3m1, p31m, p6, p6m) have a point group of order 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are 4 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. These groups are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
