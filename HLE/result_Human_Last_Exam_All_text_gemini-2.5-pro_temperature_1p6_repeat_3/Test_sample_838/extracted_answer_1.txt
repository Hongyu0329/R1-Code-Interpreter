The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

This molecule is **achiral**. The chirality of the starting material was lost in the first step of the synthesis. The E2 elimination reaction converted the sp³-hybridized chiral carbon at position 3 into an sp²-hybridized carbon as part of a double bond, resulting in the achiral intermediate 4-phenylbut-1-ene. Since no new chiral centers were generated in the subsequent steps, the final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is also achiral as it contains no carbon atom bonded to four different groups.
