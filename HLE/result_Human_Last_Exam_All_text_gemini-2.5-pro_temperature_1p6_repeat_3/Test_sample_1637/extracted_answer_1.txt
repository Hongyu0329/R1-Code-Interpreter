Yes, modifying the probe to include a longer polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain will very likely solve the precipitation problem.

The issue of low solubility is caused by the large hydrophobic thioxanthenone core and the chlorohexyloxy tail, not the polar amide group. The amide group actually contributes positively to solubility. Therefore, replacing the amide group itself is not the correct approach.

However, the strategy of using a PEG group is correct. The most effective solution would be to extend the length of the existing di-ethylene glycol chain [-(CH2)2-O-(CH2)2-O-]. Replacing it with a longer PEG chain (e.g., one with 4, 6, or more ethylene glycol units) would significantly increase the molecule's overall hydrophilicity, improve its interaction with the aqueous medium, and prevent it from precipitating at a concentration of 100 ÂµM.
