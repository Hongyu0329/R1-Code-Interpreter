    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nFirst, let's analyze the game in its classical form. The payoff matrix is:\n\n|             | Player 2: Cooperate | Player 2: Defect |\n|-------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| **Player 1: Cooperate** | (5, 5)              | (0, 7)           |\n| **Player 1: Defect**    | (7, 0)              | (1, 1)           |\n\nLet's identify the dominant strategy for Player 1:\n*   If Player 2 Cooperates, Player 1 gets 5 for Cooperating and 7 for Defecting. Player 1 should **Defect**.\n*   If Player 2 Defects, Player 1 gets 0 for Cooperating and 1 for Defecting. Player 1 should **Defect**.\n\nSo, Player 1's dominant strategy is to Defect. By symmetry, Player 2's dominant strategy is also to Defect. This leads to the unique **Nash Equilibrium** of **(Defect, Defect)**, with a payoff of **(1, 1)**. This outcome is Pareto inefficient, as both players would be better off with the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome of (5, 5). This inefficiency is the \"dilemma\".\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Quantum Game\n\nThe problem states that we can design the initial state for an optimal outcome. We will use the widely-accepted Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol for quantizing the game.\n\n**Careful Points for the Quantum Setup:**\n\n1.  **State Space:** The game is played using a two-qubit system. The classical outcomes correspond to the basis states: `|CC⟩`, `|CD⟩`, `|DC⟩`, `|DD⟩`.\n2.  **Initial State (Entanglement):** To achieve an optimal outcome and escape the classical dilemma, the players' qubits must be entangled. We design the system with maximum entanglement. An entangling operator `J` acts on the initial state `|CC⟩`. A standard choice for `J` that creates maximal entanglement is:\n    `J = (1/√2) * (I ⊗ I + i σ_x ⊗ σ_x)`\n    The initial state of the game is `|ψ_i⟩ = J|CC⟩ = (1/√2) * (|CC⟩ + i|DD⟩)`.\n3.  **Player Strategies:** In the quantum realm, players' strategies are not just simple choices but are unitary operators applied to their respective qubits. A common choice for the strategy space is the set of operators `U(θ) = exp(-iθσ_y/2)`, where `θ` is a parameter chosen by the player from `[0, π]`.\n    *   **Cooperate (C):** Corresponds to `θ = 0`, so `U(0) = I` (the identity operator).\n    *   **Defect (D):** Corresponds to `θ = π`, so `U(π) = -iσ_y` (the bit-flip operator, up to a phase).\n4.  **Measurement:** After the players (Alice and Bob) apply their strategies `U_A` and `U_B`, a disentangling operator `J†` (the conjugate transpose of J) is applied. The final state is `|ψ_f⟩ = J† (U_A ⊗ U_B) J |CC⟩`. The payoffs are then calculated based on the probabilities of measuring the final state in the classical basis states.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Quantum Payoffs\n\nLet's denote Alice's strategy choice as `θ_A` and Bob's as `θ_B`. Following the EWL protocol with the setup described above, we can calculate the probabilities (`p_ij`) of the four classical outcomes:\n\n*   `p_CC = cos²(θ_A/2) cos²(θ_B/2)`\n*   `p_CD = sin²(θ_A/2) cos²(θ_B/2)`\n*   `p_DC = cos²(θ_A/2) sin²(θ_B/2)`\n*   `p_DD = sin²(θ_A/2) sin²(θ_B/2)`\n\nNow, we can write the expected payoff for Alice, `Payoff_A`, using the given payoff values (R=5, S=0, T=7, P=1):\n`Payoff_A = 5*p_CC + 0*p_CD + 7*p_DC + 1*p_DD`\n`Payoff_A = 5cos²(θ_A/2)cos²(θ_B/2) + 7cos²(θ_A/2)sin²(θ_B/2) + 1sin²(θ_A/2)sin²(θ_B/2)`\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Quantum Equilibrium\n\nTo find the new equilibrium, we must find each player's best strategy in response to the other's. Let's analyze Alice's choice. She wants to choose `θ_A` to maximize her payoff for any given `θ_B` from Bob.\n\nLet's rewrite Alice's payoff function by factoring out terms related to her strategy (`θ_A`):\n`Payoff_A = cos²(θ_A/2) * [5cos²(θ_B/2) + 7sin²(θ_B/2)] + sin²(θ_A/2) * [1sin²(θ_B/2)]`\n\nTo make the decision clearer, let `x = cos²(θ_A/2)`. Then `sin²(θ_A/2) = 1 - x`. Alice chooses `x` between 0 and 1.\n`Payoff_A = x * [5cos²(θ_B/2) + 7sin²(θ_B/2)] + (1-x) * [sin²(θ_B/2)]`\n`Payoff_A = x * [5cos²(θ_B/2) + 7sin²(θ_B/2) - sin²(θ_B/2)] + sin²(θ_B/2)`\n`Payoff_A = x * [5cos²(θ_B/2) + 6sin²(θ_B/2)] + sin²(θ_B/2)`\n\nAlice wants to choose `x` to maximize this linear function. The decision depends on the sign of the coefficient `[5cos²(θ_B/2) + 6sin²(θ_B/2)]`. Since `cos²` and `sin²` are always non-negative, this coefficient is always positive. Therefore, to maximize her payoff, Alice should always choose the largest possible value for `x`, which is `x=1`.\n\n`x = cos²(θ_A/2) = 1` implies `θ_A = 0`.\nThis means Alice's dominant strategy is to always choose `θ_A = 0`, which corresponds to the **Cooperate (C)** strategy.\n\nBy symmetry, the same logic applies to Bob. His dominant strategy is also to **Cooperate (C)**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer - The Equilibrium Point\n\nIn this quantum version of the game, the dominant strategy for both players is to Cooperate. The unique Nash Equilibrium is therefore **(Cooperate, Cooperate)**.\n\nThe payoff at this equilibrium point `(C, C)` is determined by setting `θ_A = 0` and `θ_B = 0`.\n*   `p_CC = cos²(0) cos²(0) = 1`\n*   All other probabilities (`p_CD`, `p_DC`, `p_DD`) are zero.\n\nThe payoff vector is (5 * 1, 5 * 1) = **(5, 5)**.\n\nBy playing the game in quantum space with an optimally designed entangled state, the Prisoner's Dilemma is resolved. The equilibrium shifts from the Pareto inefficient (Defect, Defect) to the Pareto optimal (Cooperate, Cooperate).\n\nThe equilibrium point is the payoff vector associated with the equilibrium strategies.\n\n<<(5, 5)>>>"
