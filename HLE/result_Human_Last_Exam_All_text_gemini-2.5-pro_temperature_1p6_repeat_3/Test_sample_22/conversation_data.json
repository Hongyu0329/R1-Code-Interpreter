    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of SNP Heritability (h²_SNP)**\n\n*   SNP heritability is a population parameter that represents the proportion of total phenotypic variance explained by the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) considered together.\n*   It is the *theoretical maximum* predictive power that could be achieved by a perfect linear model that uses all common SNPs and their *true* (but unknown) causal effect sizes.\n*   Essentially, `h²_SNP` is the \"ceiling\" or upper bound for how much of a trait's variation can be predicted using only the information from common SNPs in an additive model.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definition of a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its predictive ability**\n\n*   A Polygenic Score is a practical tool. It is a single value that summarizes the genetic predisposition of an individual for a trait.\n*   It is constructed as a weighted sum of an individual's genotypes at many SNPs.\n*   Crucially, the \"weights\" (effect sizes) are not the true, unknown effect sizes. They are *estimates* derived from a discovery Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in an independent sample. The most common metric is R², which represents the proportion of variance in the phenotype explained by the PGS.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the ideal vs. the real-world scenario**\n\n*   **Ideal Scenario:** If we had a GWAS with an infinite sample size, we could estimate the SNP effect sizes with perfect accuracy. If we then built a PGS using these perfect effect sizes for all SNPs, the variance explained by this \"perfect\" PGS would be exactly equal to the SNP heritability (`R²_PGS = h²_SNP`).\n*   **Real-World Scenario:** In practice, this ideal is never met. Real-world PGS construction is subject to several limitations that reduce its predictive power.\n\n**Step 4: List the careful points and reasons why the predictive ability of a PGS is lower than SNP heritability**\n\n1.  **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** A discovery GWAS is always performed on a finite number of individuals. This means the estimated SNP effect sizes will always have some level of statistical noise or \"estimation error.\" They are not the true effect sizes. This error directly reduces the accuracy of the resulting PGS.\n2.  **Imperfect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** GWAS identifies tag SNPs that are statistically associated with a trait. These are often not the true causal SNPs but are merely correlated with them through LD. The strength of this correlation is often less than perfect, which means the estimated effect for the tag SNP is an attenuated signal of the true causal effect, thus reducing predictive power.\n3.  **Methodological Choices in PGS Construction:** There are various methods to build a PGS (e.g., clumping and thresholding, LDpred, PRS-CS). These methods involve statistical assumptions and parameter choices (like a p-value threshold). No method is perfect; each is an approximation that tries to optimize prediction, but they cannot fully overcome the fundamental limitations, such as estimation error. By design, they often use a subset of all SNPs or shrink the estimated effects, which means the resulting PGS does not capture the full signal defined by h²_SNP.\n4.  **Population Differences:** The discovery GWAS and the target sample (where the PGS is tested) may come from populations with different ancestry. This can lead to differences in allele frequencies and LD patterns, which generally reduces the PGS's predictive performance in the target sample.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSNP heritability (`h²_SNP`) represents the theoretical, perfect-information upper bound on prediction. A polygenic score's predictive ability (`R²_PGS`) represents what is achieved in practice with an imperfect model built from real, finite data. Due to unavoidable sources of error and information loss in the creation of any PGS, its predictive ability will be less than this theoretical maximum. Therefore, the variance explained by a PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\n\n<<<True>>>"
