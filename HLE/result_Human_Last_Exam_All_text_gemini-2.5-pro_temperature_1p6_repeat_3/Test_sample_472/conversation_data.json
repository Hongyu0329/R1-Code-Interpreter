    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the provided line of Latin poetry.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThis line is an **iambic senarius** (also known as an iambic trimeter), a common meter in Roman comedy (like the works of Plautus, where this line is from). This meter consists of six iambic feet (S L). Substitutions, such as a spondee (L L) for an iamb, are common. Plautine scansion also allows for colloquial contractions that are rare in classical epic poetry.\n\n---\n### **Careful Points and Analysis**\n\n1.  **Vowel Quantity:** We determine if a syllable is long (L) or short (S). A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel (e.g., ā, ī, ō) or a diphthong (e.g., ae, au). It is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants. Otherwise, it is short.\n2.  **Contractions (Synizesis):** In comic meter, two adjacent vowels or short syllables are sometimes \"slurred\" or compressed into a single syllable. This is called synizesis.\n3.  **Elision:** A vowel (or a vowel followed by 'm') at the end of a word is typically dropped (elided) before a word that starts with a vowel or 'h'.\n4.  **Special Plautine Rules:** Roman comedy often uses iambic shortening, where a word with an iambic pattern (S L), like `bene` or `tibi`, can be scanned as two short syllables (S S). However, for this line, synizesis provides a better metrical solution.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Scansion**\n\nLet's break down the line word by word, applying the rules above to achieve a 12-syllable iambic line. The raw syllable count is 15 (`et ti-bi be-ne es-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`), so we must find three \"lost\" syllables through contraction and elision.\n\n*   **Foot 1: `et tibi`**\n    *   `et`: The vowel `e` is short. This syllable is **S**.\n    *   `tibi`: Normally two short syllables (`tĭ-bĭ`). However, to fit the meter, this word undergoes **synizesis**. The two syllables are compressed into one long syllable, pronounced roughly as \"tbī\". This contracted syllable is **L**.\n    *   Resulting Foot: `et t'bi` -> **S L** (a perfect iamb).\n\n*   **Foot 2 & 3: `bene esse soli`**\n    *   `bene esse`: The final `-e` of `bene` **elides** with the initial `e-` of `esse`. This creates the form `benesse`.\n    *   `benesse`: We syllabify this as `be-nes-se`.\n        *   `be-`: This is a short syllable, **S**.\n        *   `-nes-`: The vowel `e` is followed by two consonants (`n` from `bene` and `s` from `esse`), making it long by position. This syllable is **L**.\n        *   `-se`: This is a short syllable, **S**.\n    *   `soli`: The word is `sōlī`, with both the `o` and the dative `ī` being long by nature. The first syllable, `sō-`, is **L**.\n    *   Resulting Feet: The `S L S` pattern of `benesse` splits across two feet.\n        *   Foot 2: `be-nes-` -> **S L** (a perfect iamb).\n        *   Foot 3 starts with the remaining syllable of `benesse` (`-se`, which is S) and the first syllable of `soli` (`sō-`, which is L). This gives `-se sō-` -> **S L** (a perfect iamb).\n\n*   **Foot 4: `(soli) quom`**\n    *   The second syllable of `soli` (`-lī`, which is L) combines with `quom`.\n    *   `quom`: This is a form of `cum` and is a long syllable, **L**.\n    *   Resulting Foot: `-lī quom` -> **L L** (a spondee, a valid substitution).\n\n*   **Foot 5: `sibi sit`**\n    *   `sibi`: Like `tibi`, this word undergoes **synizesis** and is compressed into one long syllable (\"sbī\"). This syllable is **L**.\n    *   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but it is followed by the consonant `t` and the `m` from the next word (`male`). This makes it long by position. This syllable is **L**.\n    *   Resulting Foot: `s'bī sit` -> **L L** (a spondee).\n\n*   **Foot 6: `male`**\n    *   `ma-`: The vowel `a` is short. This syllable is **S**.\n    *   `-le`: The final syllable of a Latin line is *anceps* (can be treated as long or short). To complete the iambic foot, it is scanned as long, **L**.\n    *   Resulting Foot: `ma-le` -> **S L** (a perfect iamb).\n\n### **Final Scansion**\n\nPutting it all together, the line is divided into six feet as follows:\n\net ti | bi bene | sse so | li quom | sibi sit | male\n(with contractions/elisions)\net t'bī | be nes | se sō | lī quom | s'bī sit | ma le\n\n**S L | S L | S L | L L | L L | S L**\n\n<<<S L S L S L L L L L S L>>>"
