There is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio for both reactions because Ni plays different roles in each process.
For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, where Ni provides the primary active sites, the optimal performance is achieved with a higher loading, typically a Ni/Ce molar ratio in the range of 0.2 to 0.5.
For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), where Ni acts as a dopant to enhance Ceria's redox properties, a much lower loading is optimal, typically a Ni/Ce molar ratio in the range of 0.01 to 0.05.
