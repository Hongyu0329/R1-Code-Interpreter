    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Basics of Coiled-Coil Structure**\n\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a **heptad repeat**, which is denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Core Positions (`a` and `d`):** These are the most critical positions for determining the oligomeric state. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Alanine (A)). The side chains of these residues pack together to form a stable hydrophobic core, driving the oligomerization.\n*   **Stabilizing Positions (`e` and `g`):** These positions are often occupied by charged or polar amino acids. They flank the hydrophobic core and can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between adjacent helices.\n*   **The \"Knobs-into-Holes\" Packing Model:** The side chain from an `a` or `d` position (the \"knob\") packs into a \"hole\" on the opposing helix formed by four side chains. The geometry of this packing, dictated by the size and shape of the `a` and `d` residues, determines how many helices can fit together.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Heptad Repeat Frame and Core Residues**\n\nThe sequences are 28 amino acids long, corresponding to four heptad repeats. We need to identify which amino acids fall into the critical `a` and `d` positions. By looking for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues, the most plausible frame is `(gabcdef)n`. Let's apply this frame to each sequence.\n\n**Frame:** `g-a-b-c-d-e-f`\n**Example:** For a sequence `E I A Q A L K`, the assignment would be:\n`g=E, a=I, b=A, c=Q, d=A, e=L, f=K`\n\nUsing this frame, let's identify the core `a` and `d` residues for each sequence.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Sequence Individually**\n\nHere are the key principles we will use:\n*   **`a=I, d=L`:** Canonical trimer.\n*   **`a=L, d=L`:** Canonical dimer.\n*   **`a=I, d=I`:** Canonical tetramer.\n*   **`a=N` (Asparagine):** A very strong determinant for a dimer, as it forms a specific hydrogen-bonding \"clamp\" across the dimeric interface. It overrides other signals.\n*   **Polar residues (`Q`, `T`, etc.) in the core (`a` or `d`):** These disrupt the hydrophobic packing needed for higher-order structures (trimers, tetramers) and generally favor the simplest state, a dimer.\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Core Residues:** `a=I`, `d=A` (with variations at the non-core `c` position).\n*   **Analysis:** The `a` position is occupied by Isoleucine (`I`), which has a strong preference for trimers. However, the `d` position is Alanine (`A`), which is very small. The packing of a bulky \"knob\" (`I`) into a small \"hole\" created in part by `A` is not ideal for a trimer. In the absence of a strong trimer- or tetramer-forming signal, and given the potential for inefficient packing, the structure is most likely to adopt the default and most common state.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Core Residues:** Predominantly `a=I`, `d=L`. This is a canonical trimer motif. However, in the third heptad, the `a` position residue (`I`) is replaced with `N` (Asparagine).\n*   **Analysis:** The `N` at the `a` position is a powerful dimerization motif. This single Asn \"clamp\" is strong enough to override the trimer-forming tendency of the surrounding `I(a)-L(d)` pairs.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Core Residues:** `a=I`, `d=I`. This pattern is consistent throughout the sequence.\n*   **Analysis:** The combination of beta-branched Isoleucine residues at both the `a` and `d` positions creates a relatively flat hydrophobic surface that packs most favorably in a four-helix bundle. This is the canonical sequence for a tetramer.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Core Residues:** `a=I`, `d=Q` (Glutamine).\n*   **Analysis:** The `a=I` position promotes a trimer. However, the `d` position is occupied by the polar residue `Q`. A polar residue within the hydrophobic core is highly disruptive to the packing required for stable trimers and tetramers. This disruption strongly favors a lower oligomeric state.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Core Residues:** `a=I`, `d=T` (Threonine).\n*   **Analysis:** Similar to sequence 4, we have a trimer-promoting `a=I` but a polar residue (`T`) at the `d` position. However, Threonine is less disruptive than Glutamine. Its polar hydroxyl group can sometimes be accommodated within a trimeric core by forming a hydrogen bond with the protein backbone. The strong trimer-forming propensity of `a=I` is likely to win out against the moderate disruption from `d=T`.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **Trimer (3)**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nCompiling the results from the step-by-step analysis:\n1.  Sequence 1: **Dimer (2)**\n2.  Sequence 2: **Dimer (2)**\n3.  Sequence 3: **Tetramer (4)**\n4.  Sequence 4: **Dimer (2)**\n5.  Sequence 5: **Trimer (3)**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of numbers **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
