    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement and Given Information\n*   We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The 4-point DFT of `x(n)` is `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The 4-point DFT of `h(n)` is `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   We need to find the DFT for a new sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The new sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. This is an 8-point sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Question \"Find 4-point DFT\"\n*   The sequence `y(n)` has a length of N=8. A DFT is typically calculated for the same length as the sequence, so an 8-point DFT `Y(k)` would be the natural transform.\n*   Asking for a \"4-point DFT\" of an 8-point sequence is non-standard. This usually implies one of two things:\n    1.  **Truncation:** Using only the first 4 points of `y(n)`, i.e., `{x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1)}`. This is unlikely as it discards half the given information.\n    2.  **Time-Aliasing:** Creating a 4-point sequence `y_a(n)` by wrapping the 8-point sequence `y(n)` onto itself. That is, `y_a(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   There is a DFT property that relates the DFT of the time-aliased sequence to the DFT of the original sequence: The M-point DFT of `y_a(n)` is equal to the even-indexed samples of the 2M-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n*   In our case, the 4-point DFT of `y_a(n)` is `Y(2k)` for `k=0, 1, 2, 3`, where `Y(k)` is the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. This is the most likely interpretation.\n\n**Goal:** Calculate `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`\n*   This interleaving process is the core of the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\n*   Let `y(n)` be the 8-point interleaved sequence. We can express `y(n)` in terms of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    *   The even-indexed terms of `y(n)` are `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   The odd-indexed terms of `y(n)` are `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The formula for the 8-point DFT of `y(n)` is derived from splitting the sum over even and odd indices:\n    `Y(k) = Σ_{n=0 to 7} y(n) W_8^{nk}` where `W_N = e^{-j2π/N}`.\n    `Y(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} x(m) W_8^{2mk} + Σ_{m=0 to 3} h(m) W_8^{(2m+1)k}`\n*   Since `W_8^2 = e^{-j2π(2)/8} = e^{-j2π/4} = W_4`, the formula becomes:\n    `Y(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} x(m) W_4^{mk} + W_8^k * Σ_{m=0 to 3} h(m) W_4^{mk}`\n*   Recognizing the sums as the 4-point DFTs of `x(m)` and `h(m)`, we get the key relationship:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required DFT Points\nWe need to calculate `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, `Y(6)`. We will need the values of the twiddle factor `W_8^k`:\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^{-j2π(2)/8} = e^{-jπ/2} = -j`\n*   `W_8^4 = e^{-j2π(4)/8} = e^{-jπ} = -1`\n*   `W_8^6 = e^{-j2π(6)/8} = e^{-j3π/2} = j`\n\nNow, let's compute each point:\n\n*   **For k=0:**\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    `Y(0) = 1 + (1) * (0) = 1`\n\n*   **For k=2 (target index k'=1):**\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    `Y(2) = -1 + (-j) * (1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For k=4 (target index k'=2):**\n    `Y(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4)`\n    `Y(4) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0)`\n    `Y(4) = 1 + (-1) * (0) = 1`\n\n*   **For k=6 (target index k'=3):**\n    `Y(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4)`\n    `Y(6) = X(2) + (j) * H(2)`\n    `Y(6) = -1 + (j) * (1) = -1 + j`\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is the collection of these calculated values:\n`{Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}`\n\nThis corresponds to `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
