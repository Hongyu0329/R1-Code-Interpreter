    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** We need to identify a specific person based on several key pieces of information:\n    *   They must be a physicist.\n    *   They are primarily known for their contributions to microscopy.\n    *   They discovered a specific optical effect.\n    *   This effect involves real imagery.\n    *   The initial observation was made accidentally by a custodial worker.\n    *   The context of the observation was the cleaning of concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **Focus on the Most Specific Clue:** The most unique and memorable detail is the anecdote about the custodial worker's accidental observation. This is the best starting point for the search. The story is quite famous in the history of optics.\n\n3.  **Recall/Research the Anecdote:** The story involves a cleaner at an optical institute who was polishing a set of concave mirrors. She noticed a strange, floating, three-dimensional image of her hand and polishing cloth in mid-air. Puzzled, she reported it to the scientists at the institute.\n\n4.  **Identify the Physicist:** The physicist who investigated this phenomenon was **Georges Nomarski**. He was working at the Institut d'Optique Théorique et Appliquée in Paris at the time.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Optical Effect:** Nomarski determined that the first concave mirror was forming a real image of the cleaner's hand (illuminated diffusely by the polishing action). This real image was then located at the focal point of a second concave mirror, which acted as a magnifier (similar to an eyepiece), creating a magnified, virtual, three-dimensional image that appeared to float in space. This is sometimes called an \"aerial\" or \"phantom\" image effect.\n\n6.  **Connect to Microscopy Work:** This investigation into interference and the properties of real imagery was a direct precursor to Georges Nomarski's most famous invention: Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy. This technique uses prisms to shear light waves, causing them to interfere after passing through a specimen, which translates phase shifts into amplitude changes, revealing a pseudo-3D image of unstained, transparent samples. DIC is often simply called \"Nomarski microscopy.\"\n\n7.  **Verify All Points:**\n    *   **Physicist?** Yes, Georges Nomarski was a Polish-French physicist and optician.\n    *   **Known for microscopy?** Yes, he is famous for Nomarski (DIC) microscopy.\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, the phantom image effect with two concave mirrors.\n    *   **Observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?** Yes, this matches the famous anecdote perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:** All the points in the question converge on one individual.\n\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"
