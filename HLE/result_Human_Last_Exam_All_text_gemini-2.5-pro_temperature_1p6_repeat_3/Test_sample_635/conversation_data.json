    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix:\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe factorization should be in the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n\nA left coprime factorization requires finding two matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\n*   $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be stable rational matrices. This means all poles of all entries in both matrices must be in the open left-half of the complex plane (Re(s) < 0).\n*   $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be proper rational matrices. This means for each entry, the degree of the numerator polynomial is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator polynomial.\n*   The factorization equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$, or equivalently $D(s) H(s) = N(s)$, must hold.\n*   $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be left coprime. This means that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane (CRHP), including infinity.\n\n**2. Analyze the Transfer Function H(s)**\nFirst, let's identify the poles of $H(s)$. The poles are the roots of the denominators of its entries.\n*   $H_{11}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$ has a pole at $s = -1$.\n*   $H_{12}(s) = 1$ has no poles.\n*   $H_{21}(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ has poles at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n*   $H_{22}(s) = 0$ has no poles.\n\nThe set of all poles of $H(s)$ is $\\{-1, 1\\}$. The pole at $s=1$ is unstable because it lies in the right-half plane. The factorization must handle this unstable pole.\n\n**3. Construct the Factorization**\nWe need to find a matrix $D(s)$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is stable. Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor $N(s)$ to be stable, all its entries must be stable.\n*   From $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$, it is necessary that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ are stable rational functions. Let's make the simplest choices. We can try setting $d_{21}(s) = 0$. This simplifies the second row of $N(s)$.\n*   With $d_{21}(s)=0$, the entry $N_{21}(s)$ becomes $d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$. To make $N_{21}(s)$ stable, the term $d_{22}(s)$ must cancel the unstable pole at $s=1$. This means $d_{22}(s)$ must have a zero at $s=1$. The simplest stable, proper rational function with a zero at $s=1$ is of the form $k \\frac{s-1}{s+a}$ for $a>0$. Let's choose $k=1$ and $a=1$. So, we set $d_{22}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$. This function is stable (pole at $s=-1$) and proper.\n*   Now consider the first row. Let's try the simplest stable choices for $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{12}(s)$. Let's try $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{12}(s)=0$. These are both stable and proper.\n\nWith these choices, our candidate for $D(s)$ is:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the corresponding $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0 & 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\\\ 0 + \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 + 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**4. Verify the Properties of the Factorization**\nWe have found candidate matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$. Now we must verify that they satisfy all the required conditions.\n*   **Stability:**\n    *   $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}$. The entries are 1 and $\\frac{s-1}{s+1}$. The only pole is at $s=-1$, which is in the OLHP. So, $D(s)$ is stable.\n    *   $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The poles of the entries are at $s=-1$. So, $N(s)$ is stable.\n\n*   **Properness:**\n    *   All entries in $D(s)$ (1 and $\\frac{s-1}{s+1}$) are proper.\n    *   All entries in $N(s)$ ($\\frac{s-1}{s+1}$, 1, $\\frac{2}{(s+1)^2}$, 0) are proper.\n\n*   **Factorization Equation:** By construction, $N(s)=D(s)H(s)$, which means $H(s)=D^{-1}(s)N(s)$. This condition is met.\n\n*   **Left Coprimeness:** We must check if $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all $s$ in the CRHP (Re(s) $\\ge$ 0), including $s=\\infty$.\n    \\[\n    [D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The rank of this matrix could potentially drop where $\\det(D(s))=0$.\n    $\\det(D(s)) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} - 0 = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$. This is zero at $s=1$.\n    Let's check the rank at $s=1$:\n    \\[\n    [D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\frac{1-1}{1+1} & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1-1}{1+1} & \\frac{2}{(1+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The rows $[1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1]$ and $[0 \\ 0 \\ 1/2 \\ 0]$ are linearly independent. Thus, the rank is 2.\n    Let's also check the rank at $s=\\infty$:\n    As $s \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\to 1$ and $\\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} \\to 0$.\n    \\[\n    [D(\\infty) \\quad N(\\infty)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The rows $[1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1]$ and $[0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0]$ are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n    For any other $s$ in the CRHP, $\\det(D(s)) \\neq 0$, so $D(s)$ is invertible and has rank 2, which guarantees that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ also has rank 2.\n    Therefore, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Thus, we have found a valid left coprime factorization.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
